BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

From:

Heather McKillop,

Subject:

2018 Fiscal Policy Statement

Board Meeting Date: November 28, 2017

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approves and adopts the revised Fiscal Policy Statement for 2018.

BACKGROUND
Proposed modifications to the Fiscal Policy Statement (the “Policy”) are brought to the Board of
Directors for approval during the year, as necessary. In addition, each year staff presents the proposed
Policy for development of the upcoming year’s budget.
The most recent modification to the Policy was approved by the Board of Directors in November 2016
for the 2017 fiscal year. Those changes primarily related to: 1) maintaining a total fund balance for the
Base System at an amount approximately equal to three months of Base System operating expenses
excluding depreciation among the Board-appropriated fund, the unrestricted operating reserve, and the
remaining unrestricted fund balance; and for FasTracks, the total of the Board-appropriated fund and
unrestricted fund balance would be maintained at an amount approximately equal to three months of
FasTracks operating expenses excluding depreciation; 2) designation of an unrestricted operating reserve
fund on an annual basis, to be used to mitigate service or project disruptions due to revenue
fluctuations, meet unanticipated non-recurring expenditures, or avoid cash flow disruptions, and to be
replenished promptly; 3) the maintenance of only the FasTracks Management Reserve for future
construction; and 4) clarification that the FISA will be used to complete and operate additional FasTracks
projects with expenditures subject to Board approval. The Policy Statement was also updated with the
most recent rating agency credit ratings at the time.
DISCUSSION
For 2018, the only changes proposed are for wording clarification and are reflected in the attachment.
This consists of reference to the APE where necessary, and the substitution of the word “monetize” for
“sell” in Revenue Policies #6.
Debt Policies #5 is updated with the most recent rating agency credit ratings in effect at this date.
Please see the attachments for the full proposed document and document with changes indicated.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Adopting the Fiscal Policy Statement as requested will not have a financial impact on the 2018
Recommended Budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Approval and adoption of the revised Fiscal Policy Statement for 2018.
2. Board of Directors further modifies the recommended changes. Staff reviewed the fiscal policies
and welcomes any suggestions for modifications requested by the Board of Directors.
3. Do not adopt the RTD 2018 Fiscal Policy Statement. This is not recommended because RTD’s
Fiscal Policy Statement would not contain all current language, would not adhere to best
practices, and would not best facilitate the needs of RTD’s financial operations.

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT

REVENUE POLICIES
1. Staff will plan fare adjustments every three years in the mid and long-term budgets
to adjust for inflation. The Board of Directors may consider potential fare
adjustments annually at the time of the development of the Strategic Budget Plan
(SBP) and Annual Program Evaluation (APE). As part of this process, staff will review
potential fare adjustments to establish a fare structure to ensure that it:
 is understandable
 is implementable
 is equitable
 achieves revenue levels established in the SBP
2. Fare policies will take into account the special needs of all transit dependent patrons.
3. RTD will avoid dependence on temporary revenues to fund ongoing services. Onetime revenues will be used for one-time expenditures.
4. RTD will continuously explore additional sources of revenue to help balance the
budget.
5. When appropriate the Board will actively pursue legislation that would help ensure
the continued accomplishment of RTD’s goals and mission statement. The Board
will support efforts to ensure that legislative intent is realized in allocation of state
financial resources to public transit. The Board will actively oppose legislation that
would limit or diminish revenue.
6. On an annual basis, staff will identify under- or un-utilized property and equipment,
and will make an ongoing attempt to sellmonetize such property and equipment to
enhance cash flow.
7. RTD will contract with a qualified third party to provide sales and use tax forecasting
containing projections for the short-term (one year by quarter), medium-term (sixyear SBP and APE period) and long-term (30-year Financial Plan period). The purpose
is to provide RTD with expert economic analysis and sales and use tax forecasts
using sophisticated financial modeling techniques not available internally.

20178 FISCAL POLICY STATEMENT

1.B.1.a

Fiscal Policy Statement - effective November 298, 20167

1. RTD will review its investment policy annually with the Board to ensure consistency
with the following objectives (in order of priority):
 safety of invested funds
 maintenance of sufficient liquidity to meet cash flow needs, and
 attainment of the maximum yield possible consistent with the first two objectives
2. RTD will review its investment performance on a quarterly basis with the Board.

EXPENDITURE POLICIES
1. RTD will endeavor to manage expenditures to achieve service levels that will promote
effectiveness through ease of use and improved travel times.
2. RTD will continue to look for and implement the most cost-effective and reliable
methods of delivering transportation services.
3. RTD will endeavor to maintain its assets at a level that protects capital investment
and minimizes future maintenance and replacement costs.
4. RTD maintains a risk management program which will provide protection against loss
and mitigate exposure to liability.
5. A safety program will be maintained to minimize RTD's exposure to liability and
thereby reduce the number of claims against RTD. RTD will invest in safety outreach
programs and personnel to communicate safety messages.
6. RTD will develop service changes that are needed to respond to budget shortfalls
using the system-wide and route-specific productivity measures that have been
approved by the Board.

CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT POLICIES
1. On an annual basis, RTD will prepare and update a six-year Strategic Budget Plan
(SBP) including projected capital construction and improvements, service levels,
operating costs, and revenues to fund the capital and operating programs. Capital
projects to be included in the SBP will be evaluated using the following criteria:

total project cost (design and construction) and schedule for completion;
source of funding;
operating and maintenance costs for the remainder of the SBP period;
benefits and contributions to RTD and the community, including but not limited
to the effect on future operating and maintenance costs, economy, service, and
ridership;
consideration of alternatives (joint development, etc.); consequences of not
funding; and
RTD mission statement elements, Board strategic goals, and other relevant
criteria.

2. Priority will be given to replacement of existing assets before consideration of new
assets except as allowed for in the FasTracks APE and/or financial plan (see #7
below).
3. RTD will use the first year capital program from the adopted SBP and APE as the
basis for the capital program to be included in the annual budget.
4. After completion of design of a capital project, cost estimates will be revised. If the
cost estimates exceed Delegation of Authority limits, the project will be brought to
the Board for reconsideration.
5. Facilities will be designed using current technology and allow for future technological
changes in order to be efficient and cost-effective and to protect the public welfare.
6. RTD shall allow for multi-year capital projects to be carried forward in accordance
with the carry-forward resolution adopted by the Board.
7. RTD will prepare an annual update of the FasTracks APE which will be integrated
with the SBP incorporating the actual costs incurred and the most recent available
projections of capital improvement costs, service levels, and operating costs and
revenues to fund the FasTracks capital and operating programs.

FUND BALANCE POLICIES
1. RTD will strive to maintain a fund balance in the Base System and FasTracks to
provide for unanticipated expenditures of a nonrecurring nature, to meet unexpected
increases in costs or to mitigate service disruptions as a result of economic
downturns affecting revenue. The Base System should strive to maintain a total
fund balance at an amount approximately equal to three months of Base System
operating expenses excluding depreciation among the following three reserve funds:
the Board-appropriated fund, the unrestricted operating reserve, and the remaining

Fiscal Policy Statement - effective November 298, 20167

RTD will replenish fund balances as soon as economic conditions allow.
2. In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will designate a Board-appropriated
fund balance on an annual basis. Use of the fund balance will be minimized and
occur only in specific circumstances such as economic downturns. With Board
approval, these funds may be used to avoid cash flow interruptions, reduce the need
for short-term borrowing, and assist in maintaining an investment-grade bond rating.
The source of replenishment of this fund will be identified and replenishment will
take place in a prompt manner.
3. In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will designate a capital replacement
fund on an annual basis. With Board approval, these funds will be used for scheduled
major vehicle replacements and other capital purchases.
The source of
replenishment of this fund will be identified and replenishment will take place in a
prompt manner.
4. In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will designate an unrestricted operating
reserve on an annual basis. Use of the fund balance will be to mitigate service or
project disruptions due to revenue fluctuations, unanticipated expenditures of a
nonrecurring nature, or to avoid cash flow disruptions. The source of replenishment
of this fund will be identified and replenishment will take place in a prompt manner.
5. RTD will maintain an emergency (TABOR) reserve equal to three percent of nonFederal revenues, as specified by Article X, Section 20 of the Colorado Constitution.
6. The Board shall establish a reserve for future construction under the FasTracks plan:
 The FasTracks Management Reserve will be appropriated at a sufficient level each
year to fund adjustments to the FasTracks construction schedule, relating to
logistics or cost savings opportunities that might arise after the annual budget is
adopted, and will not be used to fund the (non-FasTracks) Base System capital
or operating activity.
7. The FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) will be used to provide funding to
complete and operate additional FasTracks projects. Expenditures from the FISA will
be subject to Board approval. Funding of the FISA will be provided from the sources

unrestricted fund balance. For FasTracks, the total of the Board-appropriated fund
and unrestricted fund balance should be maintained at an amount approximately
equal to three months of FasTracks operating expenses excluding depreciation. RTD
will consider and pursue resources that will be directed to fund balance
replenishment. For example, non-recurring revenues and budget surpluses are an
especially appropriate source for replenishing fund balance.

approved by the Board.

DEBT POLICIES
1. Debt financing will not be issued to support operating expenditures.

(COPs) or other financial obligations shall be financed for a period not to exceed the
lesser of the expected useful life of the asset or a maximum of 40 years.
3. Effective communication with credit rating agencies will be maintained, and a policy
of full disclosure on every financial report and official statement will be followed.
4. Before long-term debt is issued, the impact of debt service on total annual
expenditures and the net revenue coverage ratio will be analyzed.
5. It is the intent of RTD to maintain a high quality investment-grade credit rating. The
benefit of maintaining RTD's credit ratings at the highest reasonably attainable level
in light of current economic conditions and availability of capital funding is to receive
lower interest rates and lower debt insurance premiums than would be possible with
lower credit ratings. RTD’s current ratings are listed below:

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

Subject:

2018 Investment Policy

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: November 8, 2017
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: November 28, 2017

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
adopt the Investment Policy Statement (the “Policy”), attached.
BACKGROUND
The Policy specifies the practices and procedures that pertain to the investment of RTD’s operating and
reserve funds. The Board last approved modifications to the Policy in November 2016. Section 10 of
the Policy states “The CFO shall conduct a review of the Policy on an annual basis and present the
policy, denoting any changes, to the Board of Directors for approval.”
DISCUSSION
Staff solicited the expertise, knowledge and recommendations of its investment advisor, Public Trust
Advisors, in reviewing the current Policy. One Minor change is recommended this year for clarification
sake.
The purpose of the Investment Policy (the “Policy”) of the Regional Transportation District ("RTD") is to
specify the policies and procedures that support a prudent and systematic program for investments in
RTD’s operating and reserve funds. The Policy also provides for the investment of bond proceeds that
are authorized through bond resolutions or indentures of trust.
By following best practices with respect to the management of public funds, the primary objectives of
RTD’s Investment Policy in order of priority are: 1) safety of principal, 2) sufficient liquidity to meet
known cash flow requirements, and 3) yield (achieving a market rate of return). Although RTD must
legally follow the investment parameters dictated by Colorado Revised Statutes (C.R.S. 24-75-601.1) it
has previously made a policy decision to implement its investment program in a more conservative
manner than is dictated by state statute through imposing stricter diversification limits.

Regional Transportation District
Investment Policy Statement

The purpose of this document is to specify the policies and procedures that support a prudent and
systematic program for investment transactions involving operating and reserve funds of the
Regional Transportation District ("RTD").
2. SCOPE
This investment policy ("Policy") applies to investment of all operating and reserve funds of the
RTD (collectively, the “Portfolio").
This Policy shall not restrict the ability of RTD to invest proceeds from the issuance of RTD
securities in financial obligations permitted through board-approved bond resolutions or
indentures of trust pursuant to which the securities were issued. The standards of care dictated
for investments of other RTD funds shall also pertain to the investment of such proceeds.
3. OBJECTIVES
The objectives, in priority order, of the RTD's investment activities shall be:
3.1 Safety
Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the investment program. Investments of RTD
will be made in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the Portfolio. To
attain this objective, RTD will endeavor to mitigate credit and interest rate risks.
Credit Risk: RTD will minimize credit risk, which is the risk of loss due to the failure of the
security issuer or backer, by:



Limiting investments to the types of securities listed in the Authorized Investments
section of this Policy.
Diversifying the Portfolio in accordance with Policy limits in order to minimize the
potential for losses from any one type of security or any one individual issuer.

Interest Rate Risk: RTD will minimize interest rate risk, which is the risk that the market
value of securities in the Portfolio will fall due to changes in market interest rates, by:


Maintaining Portfolio duration appropriate to the cash flow requirements of RTD,
thereby reducing the likelihood that securities would need to be sold on the open
market prior to maturity.

Packet Pg. 17

Attachment: Recommended Investment Policy 11-2-17 REDLINE (3314 : 2018 Investment Policy)

1. PURPOSE

1.B.2.a

3.2 Liquidity
The Portfolio will remain sufficiently liquid to enable RTD to meet all cash flow requirements
which might be reasonably anticipated. This will be achieved through maturity diversification
and purchases of securities that have an established secondary market.

The Portfolio shall be designed with the objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout
budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account the investment risk constraints, liquidity
needs, and cash flow characteristics of the Portfolio.
4. STANDARDS OF CARE
4.1 Prudence
All RTD officers and employees involved in the investment of RTD funds, along with any
external investment advisors, shall adhere to the guidance provided by the “prudent investor”
standard to insure that:
“When investing, reinvesting, purchasing, acquiring, exchanging, selling, or managing
public funds, a trustee shall act with care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the
circumstances then prevailing, including, but not limited to, the general economic
conditions and the anticipated needs of the agency, that a prudent person acting in a like
capacity and familiar with those matters would use in the conduct of funds of a like
character and with like aims, to safeguard the principal and maintain the liquidity needs
of the agency. Within the limitations of this section and considering individual
investments as part of an overall strategy, investments may be acquired as authorized by
law."
RTD shall recognize that no investment is totally riskless and that the investment activities of
RTD are a matter of public record. Accordingly, it recognizes that occasional measured losses
are inevitable in a diversified portfolio and shall be considered within the context of the overall
Portfolio’s return, provided that adequate diversification has been implemented, and that the sale
of a security is in the best long-term interest of RTD.
Authorized investment personnel acting in accordance with this Policy and exercising due
diligence shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security’s credit risk or
market price changes, provided that deviations from expectation are reported in a timely fashion
and appropriate action is taken to control adverse developments.
4.2 Delegation of Authority
RTD is granted legislative authority to invest its funds pursuant to Colorado Revised Statutes,
Section 32-9-119. Management responsibility for the investment program is hereby delegated to

2
Packet Pg. 18

Attachment: Recommended Investment Policy 11-2-17 REDLINE (3314 : 2018 Investment Policy)

3.3 Yield

1.B.2.a

the General Manager and his designees. The General Manager’s designee will hereinafter be
referred to as the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”).

While it is understood that the procedures and trading counterparties of a contracted investment
adviser may differ from those of RTD, contracted investment advisers must maintain internal
controls and compliance systems at least as extensive as those of the RTD in order to assure
adequate protection of RTD assets in keeping with the standards of prudence outlined below.
4.3 Investment Procedures
The CFO shall establish written procedures for the operation of the investment program,
consistent with this Policy, which shall include explicit delegation of authority to persons
responsible for investment transactions. No person may engage in an investment transaction
except as provided under the terms of this Policy and the internal procedures established by the
CFO. Persons who are authorized to transact investment business and wire funds on behalf of
RTD are listed in Appendix 1 to this policy.
4.4 Internal Controls
The CFO shall establish a system of internal controls, which shall be reviewed annually. The
controls shall be designed to prevent loss of funds due to fraud, employee error,
misrepresentation by third parties, or imprudent actions by employees of RTD.
4.5 Ethics and Conflicts of Interest
Investment activities shall be performed in accordance with RTD’s Code of Ethics and other
policies of RTD. Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from
personal business activity that could conflict with the proper execution of the investment
program, or which could impair their ability to make impartial investment decisions. Employees
and investment officials shall disclose to the General Manager any material financial interests in
financial institutions that conduct business with RTD, and they shall further disclose any large
personal/financial/investment positions that could be related to the performance of the Portfolio.
Employees and officers shall subordinate their personal investment transactions to those of RTD
particularly with regard to the timing of purchases or sales.
5. AUTHORIZED INVESTMENTS
Authorized investments for RTD funds are specifically listed below. RTD recognizes that
investment risk can result from issuer defaults, market price changes or various technical
impediments leading to diminished liquidity or loss of capital. Portfolio risk management and
diversification are employed as a way to minimize the risks inherent in investing.
3
Packet Pg. 19

Attachment: Recommended Investment Policy 11-2-17 REDLINE (3314 : 2018 Investment Policy)

RTD may, in its discretion, contract with one or more investment advisers, registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, to manage a
portion of its Portfolio assets. Any such advisor shall comply with this Policy and such other
written instructions as provided by RTD.

Credit Criteria: Credit criteria listed in this section refer to the credit rating at the time the
security is purchased. Rating categories defined by nationally recognized statistical rating
organizations (“NRSROs”) include intermediate rating categories. For example, the second
highest rating category (“AA”) includes bonds rated AA+, AA and AA- for Standard & Poor's
and Fitch, and Aa1, Aa2 and Aa3 for Moody's Investors Service. In the event that an issuer or
security is downgraded below the minimum rating level for any specific security that is held in

1.B.2.a

6. INVESTMENT PARAMETERS

RTD does not make investments for the purpose of trading or speculation, but, rather, with the
prevalent intent to hold securities to maturity. The prohibition of speculative investment
precludes pursuit of profit through unusual risk or conjectural fluctuations in market prices.
However, fluctuations in market rates or changes in credit quality may produce situations where
securities may be sold at a nominal loss in order to mitigate further erosion of principal or to
reinvest proceeds of sale in securities that will out-perform the original investment.
6.2 Competitive Bidding
A record shall be maintained of all bids and offers for securities transactions to support RTD’s
competitive pricing process. Relative offerings shall not be required in the purchase of
obligations at their initial auction or offering. Typically, awards will be made to the bidder
offering the highest effective yield consistent with the Policy: however, transaction costs,
diversification requirements, extraordinary events and other factors may be considered when
awarding investments.
6.3 Portfolio Duration
The maturity of the securities in the Portfolio shall be managed with respect to the cash flow
needs of RTD and the Portfolio shall be managed to maintain a duration of three years or less.
6.4 Authorized Financial Dealers and Institutions
RTD or an investment advisor hired by RTD will maintain a list of financial institutions
authorized to provide investment services and it shall be the policy of RTD to purchase securities
only from those authorized institutions and firms. Trading counterparties shall be limited to (i)
primary dealers reporting to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, or (ii) broker/dealers that
qualify under Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15c3-1 (uniform net capital rule).
6.5 Authorized Investment Advisors
RTD may engage the services of one or more professional investment advisory firms to assist in
the management of the Portfolio. Such investment advisors may be granted discretion to
purchase and sell investment securities in accordance with this Policy and may utilize their own
approved list of broker/dealers. Such firms must be authorized to conduct business in the State
of Colorado and shall be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

6.1 Sale of Securities

1.B.2.a

7. SAFEKEEPING AND CUSTODY

With the exception of collateral under repurchase agreements (discussed below), all investment
securities purchased shall be held in a safekeeping account or trust custody account at a
designated third party custodian. For safekeeping accounts, the institution shall issue a
safekeeping receipt for each security, listing the specific instrument, par value, rate, CUSIP and
any other pertinent information. In addition, the safekeeping or trust custody institutions shall
provide a statement on at least a monthly basis listing all securities held in account, including
book value and market value of holdings at month-end.
For collateral (purchased securities) under repurchase agreements, RTD may utilize tri-party
repurchase agreements with an acceptable third-party custodian provided that RTD is satisfied
that it has perfected interest in the securities used as collateral, and that RTD has a properly
executed tri-party agreement.
7.2 Delivery vs. Payment
All investment transactions will be executed on a delivery versus payment basis.
8. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
Investment reports shall be prepared on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis. Transaction
summaries shall be maintained and available in the office of the CFO or other authorized
investment personnel. Quarterly investment reports shall be submitted to the Board of Directors
and shall outline RTD’s total investment return and compare the Portfolio’s performance to a
publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics.
Within 120 days of the end of RTD’s fiscal year, a comprehensive report on RTD’s investment
program and investment activity shall be prepared for the Board of Directors. The annual report
shall include quarterly comparisons of investment return and may suggest improvements that
might be made in the investment program. Such annual report shall include any other item of
significance which may enhance the understanding of the investment program. Each investment
advisor shall submit like reports in a timely manner based on the respective terms of each
contract and agreement
All securities holdings reports for RTD shall disclose the maximum maturity liability to RTD
(the stated maturity) as well as the first call date of each callable security held.
9. PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
RTD's Portfolio is managed with the objective of obtaining a market rate of return,
commensurate with identified risk constraints and cash flow characteristics. Because the
composition of the Portfolio fluctuates, depending on market and credit conditions, various
indices may be used to monitor investment performance.

RTD recognizes that bond proceeds must be invested in accordance with Section 1.148 of the
U.S. Internal Revenue Code, related to arbitrage rebate, which limits the investment returns

Policy “bond proceeds” shall mean proceeds from the issuance of bonds, certificates of
participation or other financial securities issued by RTD.
10. INVESTMENT POLICY REVIEW AND APPROVAL
The CFO shall conduct a review of the Policy on an annual basis and present the Policy,
denoting any changes, to the Board of Directors for approval.

BACKGROUND
In accordance with State law, the District submitted its proposed budget to the governing body on
October 17, 2017. By legal notice, the governing body presented the proposed 2018 Requested Budget

1.B.3

DISCUSSION
The total proposed current year appropriation for the 2018 Recommended Budget (combined Base and
FasTracks) is $1,300.4 million. This includes an operating expense budget of $675.6 million, interest
expense of $153.2 million, capitalized interest of $21.4 million, new capital expenditures of $187.8
million, debt payments of $64.7 million, FasTracks management reserve of $15.9 million, FasTracks
Internal Savings Account of $71.5 million, contingency reserve of $5.0 million, Board-appropriated fund
of $33.3 million, capital replacement fund of $12.9 million, unrestricted operating reserve of $14.7
million, and estimated unrestricted fund balance of $44.3 million. The previously approved capital
(capital carry-forward) is $743.5 million. The sum of the budget appropriation and capital carry-forward
is $2,043.9 million.
Overview of the 2018 RTD Recommended Budget
Revenues of $1,213.4 million on a combined basis are expected to increase $34.9 million
(3.0%) in 2018 from the 2017 Amended Budget. This is due to 1) an increase in farebox
revenue of $4.3 million, 2) an increase in sales/use tax revenue of $40.1 million, 3) an increase
in investment income of $3.1 million, and 5) an increase in other revenue of $0.3 million, offset
by a decrease in grant revenue of $12.9 million.

Combined (Base System and FasTracks) farebox revenue of $146.8 million is budgeted to
increase 3.0% over the 2017 Amended Budget. Farebox revenue is forecasted on the
basis of a fare revenue model now being used to estimate and allocate fare revenue
between Base and FasTracks and within FasTracks service corridors. The model uses
ridership forecasts and current data on average fare paid per boarding. Based on the
model, in 2018 a higher proportionate amount of fare revenue is allocated to Base and a
lower amount is allocated to FasTracks than in previous periods.
On the Base System, farebox revenue is forecast to increase almost 1% over the 2017
Amended Budget to $115.2 million in 2018.
For FasTracks, farebox revenue is forecast to increase 11.6% to $31.6 million over the
2017 budgeted amount.
Ridership growth is expected to be flat on Base with ridership increases attributed to
FasTracks. Total revenue ridership is projected to grow 4.4% in 2018 over that projected
for 2017.
Sales and use tax revenue of $626.2 million in 2018 is expected to increase 4.9% over
the 2017 projected level according to the most recent September quarterly forecast by the
CU-Leeds School of Business. The same forecast was used in the 2018-2023 Strategic
Budget Plan (SBP).
Total grant revenue, including new and carry-forward amounts, is estimated at $414.4
million, a decrease of $12.9 million from the 2017 Amended Budget. Total Base System
grants are estimated to total $146.9 million in 2018; of that amount, $90.0 million is new
grants while projected carry-forward grant funding is $56.9 million. Base System grants
are projected to decrease $3.4 million from the 2017 Amended Budget. The decrease
reflects grant draws for LRT overhaul work and Civic Center that were made in 2017
instead of 2018.

FasTracks grants are budgeted at $267.5 million, which is a decrease of $9.4 million from
the 2017 Amended Budget largely due to lower final draws on the FFGA and decreases in
certain CMAQ grants.
Combined investment income of $7.3 million is projected to increase $3.1 million over the
2017 Amended Budget due to expectation of somewhat higher interest rates on investable
fund balances.
Other operating income and other income together will increase by $0.3 million from the
2017 Amended Budget generally due to CPI increases on recurring income such as rental
and joint venture income. The Build America Bonds subsidy of $8.8 million for FasTracks
Project is not increased at the CPI. Other income also includes full-year payment by the
University of Colorado for naming rights on the A Line (FasTracks Operations) and DUS
rental income (Base).

Operating expenditures are budgeted at $675.6 million on a combined basis in 2018 (excluding
depreciation), which is $13.6 million higher compared to the 2017 Amended Budget. Base
System operating expenses are budgeted to increase $25.9 million, FasTracks Project operating
expenses are budgeted to decrease $19.5 million, and FasTracks Operations operating expenses
are budgeted to increase $7.1 million. On the Base System, departmental operating expenses
are targeted amounts derived from the SBP, plus operating and maintenance projects approved in
the 2018-2023 SBP, plus operating/expense projects carry-forward from 2017, and other
miscellaneous increases unknown at the time of the SBP. For FasTracks Operations, the
increase is generally due to both direct costs and full allocation from Base to FasTracks of costs
of operating the new service corridors, including additional security services, and a higher
estimated service payment to Denver Transit Operators for Eagle operations and maintenance.
For FasTracks Project, the decrease is due to completion of several FasTracks projects and
capitalization of certain costs to the uncompleted corridors. For FasTracks, operating expenses
are derived from the Annual Program Evaluation (APE).
The operating/expense project carry-forward to 2018 is $19.0 million for Base System, $20.9
million for FasTracks Project, and $0.9 million for FasTracks Operations. New operating and
maintenance projects approved in the SBP (Base System) for 2018 total $13.3 million (in 2017
dollars). It should be noted that reductions were made overall to departmental operating budgets
including expense projects to bring expenditures into alignment with the SBP and APE.
Diesel fuel is budgeted at an estimated price of $1.80 per gallon, compared to a lock price of
$1.69 per gallon in the 2017 Amended Budget, resulting in an incremental higher cost of
approximately $1.1 million over 2017. Senior staff is reviewing opportunities to lock diesel at a
favorable price for 2018. Gasoline is budgeted at $2.65/gallon, which is the same price as in
the 2017 budget for no change.
The major changes in operating expenses comparing the Recommended Budget to the posted
Requested Budget are shown in Attachment A. The majority of the changes from the Requested
Budget consist of additions for approved SBP expense projects and expense projects carryforward, as well as start-up costs for North Metro operations not determined in the Requested
Budget.
The 2018 Recommended Budget includes funding for the first year of start-up costs related to
future RTD operation of the North Metro commuter rail line. The expense budget of $3.9 million

Packet Pg. 34

1.B.3

covers staffing, consumables and spare parts to be purchased for maintenance of the
infrastructure and passenger facilities, and training and other support needed to prepare for
revenue service. The capital budget of $13.4 million covers the first year of facilities
modifications and heavy equipment to be purchased to support revenue service.
Interest expense in 2018 is budgeted at $153.2 million on a combined basis, a decrease of $2.2
million from the 2017 Amended Budget. The decrease is due to the effect of refundings and
rescheduled amortization. Of total interest expense, $21.8 million is budgeted for Base System
and $131.5 million is budgeted for FasTracks. FasTracks interest expense includes the TABOR
interest expense of $34.4 million which is paid with the DTO service payment.
Capitalized interest (combined) is budgeted at $21.4 million, all of which will occur in FasTracks
Project for the North Metro debt. Capitalized interest will be part of the actual cash outlay for
interest payments in 2018.
Principal payments on debt are estimated at $64.7 million on a combined basis, which is $6.6
million higher than the 2017 Amended Budget. Base System principal payments of $59.0 million
are $9.0 million higher due to re-scheduled amortization of debt through refundings. FasTracks
principal payments of $5.7 million are $2.4 million lower due to re-scheduled amortization of
debt through refundings. No new debt issuances are planned in 2018 for either the Base System
or FasTracks. Both will draw from previously issued debt to fund major capital purchases and
construction in 2018.
Capital expenditures are comprised of both the capital carry-forward from 2017 (previously
approved capital) arising from timing of project completion, and new capital for 2018. The
capital carry-forward will be $743.5 million made up of $104.8 million on the Base System and
$638.7 million on FasTracks.
New capital spending of $187.8 million on a combined basis will decrease $114.5 million from
the 2017 Amended Budget due mainly to project completion in FasTracks. New capital spending
for FasTracks will decrease $105.9 million to $128.9 million in 2018 due to on-going project
completion, mainly North Metro, offset by an increase to the East corridor for reconciliation of
finance charges. For the Base System, new capital spending will decrease $8.6 million from the
2017 Amended Budget to $58.9 million. Of this amount, the Base system will spend $5.6
million less on facilities construction and maintenance (mainly Customer Care Center relocation,
Blake entryway remodel, and fire protection), $6.2 million less on bus Infrastructure (16 th Street
Mall reconstruction), $1.4 million less on Park-n-Rides (US36 & Sheridan station), $0.9 million
less on rail transit and infrastructure (several projects), and $12.7 million less on fleet
modernization and expansion (all vehicles except for ADA). These decreases will be offset by
$10.4 million more on capital support projects (Burnham Yard land purchase, Colfax 15L Route
Improvement project, and blank out screens on Welton Street), $4.6 million more on rail
construction (downtown track and switches replacement and Central corridor rail replacement),
and $3.2 million more on capital support equipment (support and service vehicles and in-plant
equipment). The Base System new capital was approved as part of the Strategic Budget Plan in
October 2017 and is the amount identified for minimum “must have” projects within SOGR
priorities.
Regarding the Colfax 15L Route Improvement project, capital funds were approved in the SBP as
$4,638,103 in 2018 and $1,625,000 in 2019. In this 2018 Recommended Budget, the project
funding will be revised so that funds from 2019 will move to 2018 to allow for a bid on the

Packet Pg. 35

1.B.3

construction contract in early 2018. Thus, the project amount for 2018 will be $6,263,103 (in
2017 dollars) and the amount for 2019 will be $0.
New capital expenditures for 2018 and the change in new capital in the 2018 Recommended
Budget over the 2018 Requested Budget are shown in Attachment B. The capital carry-forward
expenditures for 2018 and the change in the capital carry-forward in the 2018 Recommended
Budget over the 2017 Amended Budget are shown in Attachment C.
Notable designated fund balance and reserve changes include an increase in the Base System
year-end unrestricted fund balance from the 2017 Amended Budget to $31.4 million. This
projected fund balance is in alignment with the SBP target after incorporating all revenue and
expense adjustments. The actual amount realized, however, may be lower (or higher) than that
projected due to lower (or higher) fare revenue and sales tax revenue in 2017 (this will become
evident in the 2018 amended budget). Also on the Base System, the Board-appropriated fund is
projected to increase by $3.0 million to $20.4 million, the capital replacement fund is projected
to decrease by $2.7 million to $0, and the unrestricted operating reserve is projected to increase
by $5.0 million to $14.7 million.
A $5.0 million contingency reserve is created for the first time for the Base System. The
purpose of this reserve is to cover unanticipated needs that may arise through the fiscal year.
The funds will be used at the General Manager’s discretion to fund unbudgeted inflationary
increases, respond to emergencies, new regulations, and cover cost overruns.
In FasTracks Project and FasTracks Operations, the reserve funds are maintained at 3 months of
operating expenses. Additionally, the FasTracks management reserve is budgeted at $15.9
million and the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) is budgeted at $71.5 million.
On a District-wide basis, the total of the Board-appropriated fund, the capital replacement fund,
the unrestricted operating reserve and the unrestricted fund balance is projected to increase
$23.6 million over the 2017 Amended Budget. These increases are in minimum accordance with
fiscal policies for each of the District entities (Base System, FasTracks Project and FasTracks
Operations) per Fund Balance Policy below.
Cost Recovery Ratio
The 2018 Recommended Budget meets the cost recovery ratio mandated by the Colorado
General Assembly. The estimated SB154 recovery ratio (all non-tax revenue except ADA farebox
revenues divided by all expenditures, including depreciation, except ADA expenditures and
expenditures incurred for long-term planning and development of rapid transit infrastructure)
exceeds the annual target of 30% mandated by the General Assembly.
Fund Balance Policy
The Fund Balance Policy for 2018 requires fund balances to consist of a Board-appropriated
fund, a capital replacement fund, and the remaining unrestricted year-end fund balance for both
the Base System and FasTracks, as well as an additional unrestricted operating reserve currently
for the Base System. The objective is for the total of these funds excluding the capital
acquisition fund to equal approximately three months of operating expenses excluding

Packet Pg. 36

1.B.3

depreciation for both Base System and FasTracks. The 2018 budget reflects maintenance of a
FasTracks management reserve at a level deemed sufficient to fund adjustments to the
FasTracks construction schedule.
The total of these fund balances (excluding the management reserve) for 2018 on a District-wide
basis is projected at $105.3 million, comprised of 1) the Board-appropriated fund of $33.3
million, 2) the capital replacement fund of $12.9 million, 3) the unrestricted operating reserve of
$14.7 million, and 4) the remaining unrestricted year-end fund balance of $44.3 million. The
Base System portion of these fund balances listed for 2018 is projected to total $66.5 million.
Basis of Accounting Used in Budgeting
The accounts of the District are reported using the GAAP accrual basis of accounting with two
exceptions:





Capital outlays and payments of bond principal are treated as expenditures.
Gains and losses on disposal of property and equipment are excluded.
The non-cash portion of the long-term unfunded pension accrual is excluded.
Asset sale proceeds and debt issuance proceeds are included.
Attachments

As noted above, please refer to the attached Fiscal Year 2018 Recommended Budget and Fiscal
Year 2018 Recommended Budget-Fund Balance (Exhibit I) which shows the operating/nonoperating sources, debt and reserves, and capital sources as well as operating uses, capital
expenditures, and fund balances of the District, and a reconciliation of net assets. Also attached
is the Program Capital Summary including previously approved capital, an Operating Budget
Changes Since Posted Budget summary (Attachment A), a New Capital Projects summary

ALTERNATIVES
1. Adopt the 2018 Recommended Budget. This is the recommended action.
2. Revise the 2018 Recommended Budget and adopt with Board-directed revisions.
3. Do not adopt the 2018 Recommended Budget. This is not recommended since the District
will not be in compliance with State regulations that require the District to adopt a budget by
December 31, 2017. If the District does not adopt a budget before December 31, 2017, State
statute (29-1-108 (3) C.R.S.) specifies the following penalty:
"Only ninety percent (90%) of the prior year's appropriation for operations and
maintenance purposes and objects is deemed re-appropriated."

(1) Variance is due to timing of invoices for contracted services as well as parts and supplies orders lagging expectations.
(2) Variance is due to the timing of rail line openings
(3) Variance is due to the timing of payment for management services
(4) Variance primarily due to the reversal of a December bill of sale for US36 assets on FasTracks and delay of multiple projects on Base System
(5) Variance is primarily due to the timing of payment for outside security services and contracted maintenance
(6) Variance is primarily due to higher-than-expected self-insured claims for liability and worker's compensation
(7) Variance is primarily due to the timing of purchase of data processing services
(8) Variance is primarily due to the timing of production of outside promotional and informational materials and openings
(9) Variance due year-end accrued expenses that did not materialize

Board Meeting Date: November 14, 2017
Information

The Smart Card Program is an Electronic Fare Collection and Payment System designed to increase fare
payment convenience for our customers, reduce and optimize fare collection costs for the agency and
reduce fraud associated with paper based fare media. The contract was signed with Xerox Transport
Solutions, Inc. (now Conduent) in mid-2010. A smart card is a plastic card which customers load and
reload RTD fare products. There are currently 4 products; EcoPass, CollegePass, Neighborhood EcoPass
and MyRide Stored Value available on the smart card.
All buses and light rail validators installations are complete. Additional validators will be installed as new
buses and light rail stations are commissioned into service.
The Smart Card Program launched to EcoPass, CollegePass and Neighborhood EcoPass customers on
January 1, 2013. There are approximately 475,000 active cards in circulation. During the month of
October 2017, 1.4M taps were recorded.
Starting the morning of January 4, 2016 MyRide Stored Value cards were dispersed to the public pilot
program participants at the RTD retail outlets. On Wednesday May 17, 2017, the MyRide web portal
went live to the pilot participants and on May 24, 2017, the MyRide web portal was launched to the
general public. As of October 2017, approximately 16,000 cards were issued, of which 11,400 (71%)
were full fare cards and 4,600 (29%) were discount cards. The average stored value loaded (initial
purchases and reloads) was $41.74, with a total value loaded of $1,570,000. There were 405,600
trips taken using these MyRide cards with a fare payment value of $1,087,000. Of these trips: 76%
were local, 21% regional and 3% airport.
Additional value can be loaded onto the card online, at RTD sales outlets and at Retail outlets (Safeway
and King Soopers). As of June 1, 2017, customers can load cash value onto MyRide cards at 47
Safeway retail stores. Since launch, Safeway has processed $5,000 in cash value reloads. as of July 1,
2017, customers can load cash value onto MyRide cards at 86 King Soopers retail stores. Since launch,
King Soopers has processed $12,000 in cash value reloads.
As of January 1, 2017, Xerox Transport Solutions, Inc. separated its Business Process Services Unit into
an independent public company called Conduent. Xerox will be referred to as Conduent.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

Subject:

Fiscal Sustainability Update

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: November 8, 2017
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: November 14, 2017
Information

BACKGROUND
A Fiscal Sustainability Task Force (Task Force) was formed in 2010 for the purpose of making
recommendations detailing opportunities for operating efficiencies and revenue enhancement for the
Base System to ensure RTD’s long-term fiscal sustainability. The Task Force consisted of 22 members
with 12 of those members being external to RTD.
The Task Force presented its written
recommendations to the Board of Directors in 2011. The Board of Directors subsequently approved
those recommendations and directed Staff to pursue implementation of each recommendation. The
Task Force reconvened for a final meeting in 2012 to be briefed on the progress of their
recommendations and provide an opportunity for feedback.
DISCUSSION
The Task Force made revenue enhancement, expense reduction and fiscal policy recommendations to
the Board of Directors which were approved for further consideration and/or implementation. The
majority of the recommendations made have been completed or their status has not changed since our
last report in March 2017. Per Board policy, we continue to report periodically on the status of the Task
Force recommendations below. Each recommendation is summarized below and expanded comments
are provided for those that have had a change in status since the last report.
Recommendations - Completed
Removing the Volatility from Sales and Use Tax Projections
RTD contracted with the University of Colorado, Leeds School of Business – Business Research Division
(Leeds) to provide sales and use tax forecasts beginning in 2011. These forecasts are updated semiannually by CU-Leeds.
Service Optimization
Service optimization was recommended by the Task Force and implemented with Board approval in order
to match services provided with available funding sources. Service modifications were brought forward
to accommodate the new FasTracks lines opening in 2016 and we continue to assess service
optimization.
Fund Balance Policy
Due to the volatility of RTD’s largest single revenue source, sales and use taxes, the Task Force
recommended implementation of a more robust fiscal policy regarding fund balances. In response to this
recommendation, RTD implemented a fund balance policy with a target level of three months of
operating expenses for both the Base System and FasTracks. While FasTracks has met this objective,
the Base System has not and is not expected to fully meet this goal within the six-year term of the
Strategic Budget Plan.
Sales and Use Tax Exemptions

Packet Pg. 73

1.C.3

Exemption parity with the state of Colorado was identified by the Task Force as providing a benefit to
RTD during difficult economic conditions when the state implements exemption changes. In addition,
exemption parity removes the complexity to vendors of RTD having different taxable items than the
state. Through legislation introduced by RTD, exemption parity took effect in January 2014. This
change in legislation has been challenged and the Colorado Supreme Court granted a Petition for Writ of
Certiorari. Oral arguments are scheduled for November 2017.
Technology and Energy Innovation
RTD conducted an energy review of the major operating facilities and installed equipment and lighting
upgrades where possible. RTD budgets for energy upgrades throughout the District in the Strategic
Budget Plan. We will continue to address energy efficiency in building systems as on-going projects are
completed.
Sales and Use Tax Compliance Reviews
The Colorado Department of Revenue (DOR) collects and audits sales and use taxes for RTD. The Task
Force identified an opportunity for revenue enhancement by performing additional sales and use tax
compliance reviews based on the favorable collection experiences of Colorado cities and municipalities
that implemented these reviews. While assessments from this effort exceeded the costs, it was not
clear to what extent those assessments would be collected. RTD staff decided not to extend the
contract for this work beyond 2015 due to the limited remaining opportunities for assessments outside
of the scope of work of the DOR.
Recommendations – Ongoing
Naming Rights
The first naming rights/corporate sponsorship agreement under the Board-adopted naming rights policy
was reached with the University of Colorado for naming the commuter rail A Line and creating an
advertising presence on the Flatiron Flyer bus rapid transit line. Any additional proposed naming
rights/corporate sponsorship contracts will continue to be brought to the RTD Board for approval.
Partnerships and Privatization
The Task Force described this recommendation as a broad area that could include items such as
privatizing routes and administrative and operational functions to reduce expenses. These have included
the lease of the DUS historic building, IGAs for improvements to US36 and the East (A) Line, as well as
TOD activities. RTD continues to look for partnership and privatization opportunities on an ongoing
basis.
Recommendations – Low Priority
The status of recommendations made by the Task Force and categorized as having lower priority
follows:
Charge for Parking
RTD currently charges parking fees to out-of-District patrons, in-District patrons that park longer than 24
hours, and for reserved parking. In 2013, the state legislature allowed daily parking fees only at nonDistrict facilities. In 2016, RTD staff presented a parking management briefing at a study session that
focused on a consultant pay-for-parking study, parking management program update, and FasTracks
partnering projects. Since the inception of the parking management program through the third quarter
of 2017, $774,402 has been contributed to the general fund.

Tolling and Managed Lanes
The Task Force recommended investigating the possibility of RTD generating additional revenues
through charges for tolling and managed lanes.
Enacting this recommendation would require
coordination with CDOT and other agencies. The US36 BRT project is an example of how tolling and
managed lanes can enhance RTD operations and save costs.
Home Rule Initiative
The Task Force recommended that RTD consider becoming a “Home Rule” entity which would allow
RTD to collect and audit its sales and use taxes instead of the DOR. This initiative would require
legislation. The Colorado Municipal League and other entities recommended against it. It could only be
secured for RTD by statewide constitutional amendment. As discussed earlier in this report, RTD has
effected simplification of state and RTD taxation through legislation that provides for uniformity on
items taxed.

INFORMATION
Please find the District’s investment report for the third quarter of 2017 attached.
The U.S. economy and household spending continued to expand at a moderate pace during the third
quarter of 2017. The U.S. unemployment rate remained low at 4.4% and general inflationary pressures
remained tame.
In view of inflation and labor market conditions, Federal Reserve Open Market Committee decided to
maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1 to 1.25 percent. The Committee stated “the
stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor
market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation.”
The District’s Investment Policy (the “Policy”) is conservative in nature and seeks to satisfy the three
primary objectives of: safety, liquidity and yield, in that order of importance.
The Policy specifies that:
“Quarterly reports shall outline the District’s total investment return and compare the portfolio’s
performance to a publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics
to the portfolio or sub-portfolio being measured. For the liquidity tier of the portfolio (cash and cash
equivalents), the specified index shall be the 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index as published by Bank of
America Merrill Lynch for the period being measured. For the enhanced cash portion of the portfolio
(securities maturing between 90 days and 5 years and with a target duration of 1 year), the designated
performance benchmark will be the Merrill Lynch 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.”
The total return on the liquidity and enhanced cash tiers of the District’s unrestricted portfolio and
investment benchmarks were as follows:
Liquidity Tier:

The yield of the District’s unrestricted portfolio for the month of September was 1.55%. Year to date
invest earnings if annualized would produce annualized earnings of $3,957,763.
Historical performance of RTD Liquidity Tier investments relative to the Investment Policy benchmark is
