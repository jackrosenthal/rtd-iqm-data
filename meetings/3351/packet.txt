BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Monthly Government Relations Report – July 2022

Committee Meeting Date:
July 21, 2022

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Davies, Government Relations Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
Pursuant to the Board-adopted 2022 Legislative Program, the agency developed a Legislative Program
that serves as a guiding document for staff to pursue goals related to legislative and policy matters. A
Legislative Program serves as a living document that can be adjusted throughout a legislative session to
provide an avenue for Board adopted policy positions to be communicated and pursued by agency staff.
In line with the agency’s mission and vision established in the Strategic Plan, the development and
inclusion of the goals and actions contained in the Legislative Program are designed to make lives better
through connections.
It is important that RTD serve as a trusted partner to the region’s local, state, and federal elected
officials. To achieve these goals, RTD must be proactive in educating and informing the District’s elected
officials of the challenges and opportunities available to advance shared goals.
In furtherance of the program, the agency’s Government Relations Officer coordinates and develops
strategic communications to advance the agency’s legislative priorities and serve as a point of contact
for elected officials in the Denver metro region.
DISCUSSION
Included herein are notable Government Relations highlights at the federal, state and local levels since
the last Executive Committee meeting held on June 23, 2022. This report was prepared on July 14,
2022 and will be updated verbally as needed during the Executive Committee meeting scheduled for
Thursday, July 21, 2022.
Federal
At the federal level, the U.S. House of Representatives (House) quickly moved through the Fiscal Year
2023 Appropriations process. The annual funding bill for transportation programs has advanced through
the Transportation-Housing and Urban Development Subcommittee as well as the Appropriation
Committee on party-line votes, with House leadership’s goal of final passage prior to the August 2022
summer recess. Included in the Community Project Funding section of the bill at the request of
Representative DeGette is $4 million in funding to assist RTD with maintaining the state of good repair

Packet Pg. 18

1.5.1.1

for the central rail corridor replacement. Regarding Senate proceedings, progress on advancing
Appropriations bills is moving less quickly. Without a final Senate Appropriations bill to conference with
the House version, Congress’ need to adopt a Continuing Resolution will increase as the end of the
federal fiscal year nears.
Lastly, regarding the return of the Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing-related Credit Risk
Premium (CRP) from the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), RTD has provided all DOT-requested
information requested. The final step is for DOT to make the funding available through the federal grant
award system, which will allow RTD to draw the CRP funds. RTD staff will keep the Board of Directors
updated on this process.
State
At the state level, RTD staff engaged with the Colorado Energy Office (CEO) to submit the grant
application for the Zero Fare for Better Air campaign launching in August 2022. The agency submitted
the application to the CEO on July 7, 2022, and received a response on July 14, 2022 of the CEO’s
intent to award RTD $8,650,000. This amount is approximately $150,000 less than RTD’s request as
the CEO stated the customer survey is not an eligible expense; however, RTD is committed to receiving
feedback, hence, the agency will incur the survey expense.
Local
At the local level, RTD staff worked closely with the Colorado Secretary of State’s office and the county
clerks and recorders for RTD’s eight-county service area to discuss the potential of a staff
recommendation for Board consideration regarding zero-fare transit service on and around the 2022
General Election, as well as a partnership to enhance ballot box access on RTD property.
Additionally, staff continued to engage with local jurisdictional representatives regarding the Zero Fare
for Better Air campaign.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
2022 Contract Amendment for the Platte Boiler Project

Committee Meeting Date:
July 12, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
July 26, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO, or her designee, to amend
contract #19DD-001 with Rasmussen Mechanical Services to increase the not-to-exceed amount by
$840,000 from $904,045 to $1,744,045 for the purchase and installation of three replacement boilers
at the Platte garage.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Henry J. Stopplecamp, Assistant General Manager, Capital Programs
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Platte Division building heating plant requires two boilers to heat offices, workshops, and the bus
garage in cold weather. A third boiler provides spare capacity. The original boilers were replaced in
2014. The replacement boilers were damaged due to incorrect set up by the installing contractor. RTD
pursued legal recourse and obtained a settlement.
A subsequent contractor was retained in 2019 to install new boilers. Further investigation showed that
the other two boilers were damaged in a similar way.
The initial contract has been amended twice for additional work to install the first boiler, then to replace
the second and third boilers. The previously approved contract value is $904,045.00. With this request
to increase contract authority, the project value will be capped at $1,744,045.
DISCUSSION
The boilers and associated piping and pumps are expected to have a 25-year life expectancy, if well
maintained. Removing and installing the new boilers requires significant effort and specialty consultants
and contractors. This work is expected to improve staff productivity, reduce energy use, improve indoor
air quality, and enhance reliability.
Connecting the new equipment to the Building Automation System also allows for better control and
energy savings and will allow technicians to remotely resolve issues. It is more labor and cost efficient to
complete the Building Automation System integration work while the boilers are being installed and
commissioned, rather than doing the work separately later.
The $840,000 contract authority requested will cover the additional costs projected. Approximately
$471,000 is available from the current project budget and approximately $369,000 is requested from
the General Manager’s contingency fund to cover the difference. Any funding left over will be returned
to the general fund. Energy savings for the new heating system is estimated to be $50,000 per year.

Construction work began at the end of the heating season on May 16, 2022. The new system needs to
be operational by mid-September 2022. The roughly 120-day timeline has required RTD staff, design
consultants, the building automation system company, and the contractor to work in an expedited
manner.
In adopting this recommended action, the agency seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan priorities
of Employee Ownership and Customer Excellence, as it is incumbent upon the agency to provide
employees with a comfortable work environment as they deploy critical services from the Platte Division.
Moreover, completing this work will also prevent water pipes from freezing, creating further service
disruption.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The financial impact with the boiler replacement is $840,000.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Series 2014A Certificates of Participation Refinancing

Committee Meeting Date:
July 12, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
July 26, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the RTD Board of Directors to adopt the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Bond Resolution”),
Series of 2022 authorizing the issuance of the Bonds, (FasTracks Project), Series 2022A and 2022B.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVES
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
Brenden Morgan, Senior Manager of Debt and Investments
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
In 2014, RTD issued its series 2014A FasTracks certificates of participation (COPs) as a funding source
for the North Metro commuter rail project with a principal amount of $440,000,000. The COPs may be
refinanced at RTD’s option any time after the optional redemption date of June 1, 2023.
The approaching optional redemption date and current interest rate environment have created an
opportunity to refinance these obligations with FasTracks bonds to realize a reduction in interest
expense that meets the RTD Board policy thresholds.
DISCUSSION
After discussing this refinancing opportunity with the RTD Board in March 2022, staff issued a request
for information (RFI) from its pool of investment banks seeking recommendations to execute this
refinancing transaction. RTD received nine responses to that RFI. The most attractive and efficient
refinancing proposals were received from Royal Bank of Canada (RBC)/City National Bank and Bank of
America. These proposals offered to directly purchase FasTracks “Cinderella” bonds (which change from
taxable to tax-exempt after the optional redemption of the 2014A COPs).
This refinancing results in a direct sale of the new bonds to these banks rather than selling in the bond
marketplace. A primary advantage of this approach is to reduce the issuance cost from approximately
$3 million to $0.5 million by avoiding underwriter fees and documentation costs.
Due to the direct bond sale to the banks, certain maturities were excluded by the banks necessitating an
RTD defeasance of those maturities using unrestricted fund balances of approximately $95 million.
These funds are available from budget savings in 2021 and the application towards defeasance of
certain maturities significantly increases the interest savings to RTD and lowers FasTracks debt service
requirements.
This refinancing would consume the approximately $350 million of remaining FasTracks sales tax bond
2004 voter-approved borrowing capacity. RTD’s bond counsel, Butler Snow, has stated that obtaining
bond counsel concurrence for issuance of voter-authorized debt more than 20 years after such approval
is granted is not supported by case law. Therefore, RTD will utilize this remaining debt capacity with

Packet Pg. 26

2.17.B

this transaction and prior to 2024 to realize the additional interest savings benefits achieved through
bond rather than COP issuance.
Subsequent to this refinancing, the assets pledged under the 2014A COPs will be released by the Asset
Acquisition Authority and may be used in the future for new lease-purchase financing allowing RTD to
finance additional projects, if necessary.
The attached Resolution allows for the refinancing of the Series 2014A COPs for interest expense
savings. The related contractual documents required to effectuate this transaction are identified in the
Resolution and include:
•
•
•
•
•

Continuing Covenant Agreement
Rate Lock Agreement
Escrow Agreement
Bond Purchase Agreement
Indenture of Trust

Substantially final drafts of the contractual documents are on file and available for review on the RTD
Financial Information webpage under the “Documents for Potential Bond Refunding”. The Financial
Information webpage can be found at the following link: https://www.rtd-denver.com/financialsinvestors
The Bond Resolution delegates to each of the General Manager/CEO or Chief Financial Officer the
independent authority to make any determination delegable pursuant to Section 11-57-205(1)(a-i) of the
Supplemental Act, to sign one or more contracts for the purchase of the Bonds or to accept binding bids
for the Bonds and to execute any agreement or agreements in connection therewith (collectively, the
“Purchase Agreement”), and to execute one or more sale certificates (collectively, the “Sale Certificate”)
setting forth such determinations, without any requirement that the RTD Board approve such
determinations, including without limitation, the date that the Bonds will be issued and delivered to the
Purchasers, subject to the following parameters and restrictions:
(a)
the final maturity of the Bonds shall be no later than November 1, 2044;
(b)
the aggregate principal amount of the Bonds shall not exceed $350,000,000;
(c)
the net effective interest rate of the Bonds shall be less than the net effective interest rate
of the Refunded 2014A Certificates;
(d)
the combined maximum annual repayment cost of the Bonds and all other outstanding
debt issued pursuant to the 2004 Election shall not exceed the maximum annual
repayment cost authorized in the notice of election sent to the voters in connection with
the 2004 Election;
(e)
the combined debt service requirements of the Bonds and all other outstanding debt issued
pursuant to the 2004 Election, when combined with the debt service requirements
previously paid for all other debt issued pursuant to the 2004 Election, shall not exceed
the maximum total repayment cost authorized at the 2004 Election; and
(f)
the purchase price of the 2022A Bonds shall not be less than 100% of the original
principal amount of the 2022A Bonds; and the purchase price of the 2022B Bonds shall
not be less than 100% of the original principal amount of the 2022B Bonds.
RTD is receiving the advice of Hilltop Securities as independent financial advisors and Butler Snow LLP
as bond counsel in regard to the transaction. The bonds will be sold to RBC/City National Bank and
Bank of America as a result of the responses they provided to RTD’s request for information.

2.17.B

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The proposed transaction would use unrestricted funds (~$95 million), related debt service reserves
(~$35 million) and remaining 2014A COP project funds (~$4 Million) to pay down existing debt. Costs
of the refinancing are estimated to be less than $0.5 million, including financial advisory, legal and
miscellaneous fees.
Financial market conditions as of June 23, 2022 would generate gross savings to RTD of approximately
$294 million ($152 million or 34.5% net present value savings) by the refinancing project.
Upon completion of the proposed transaction, the assets related to the Series 2014A COPs will be
completely unencumbered and available for use in any potential future financing needs of RTD.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
General Election Day 2022 Zero-Fare and Ballot Drop Box
Deployment Partnerships

Committee Meeting Date:
July 12, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
July 26, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO, or her designee, to implement
zero fares on October 28, 2022 (National Vote Early Day) and November 8, 2022 (General Election
Day).
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Davies, Government Relations Officer
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
At the Board of Directors meeting held on Tuesday, March 22, 2022, during Other Matters, Director
Bouquet raised the question of RTD’s ability to provide zero-fare transit days for General Elections. The
General Manager and CEO responded that staff would provide information to enable the Board to have
an informed discussion regarding a path forward.
DISCUSSION
Data from the Survey of the Performance of American Elections from the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology’s Election Data and Science Lab demonstrated that in 2016 approximately 30 percent of
non-voters across the country claimed that the lack of transportation to the polls was a factor in
deciding not to vote. Among persons of color under the age of 30 responding to the survey, 38 percent
cited lack of transportation as a reason for not voting.
While research shows that Colorado’s system of mail ballot voting significantly increases voter turnout
both overall and for all major demographic groups, providing zero-fare transit during general elections
would further reduce barriers to polling place access, particularly among traditionally disadvantaged
voter groups. The RTD Board of Directors’ approval of system-wide zero-fare transit on general election
days would demonstrate the agency’s commitment to the Strategic Priorities of Community Value and
Customer Excellence.
As part of the internal work to bring this recommended action for Board consideration, RTD staff
convened a conversation with the County Clerks and Recorders for the eight-county RTD service area,
as well as with staff from the Secretary of State’s Office. The primary objective of convening
conversations with the Clerks and Recorders and the Secretary of State’s Office was to ensure
coordination and receive feedback to inform the RTD staff recommendation.
It is the Clerks and Secretary of States’ position that early voter promotion is paramount. With that in
mind, RTD staff will continue to coordinate and promote its ballot drop box deployment program with all
applicable jurisdictions within RTD’s eight-county district. Additionally, the majority of the Clerks within
RTD’s district and the Secretary of State’s Office support holding a zero-fare transit day to encourage

Packet Pg. 48

2.17.C

voting on the National Vote Early Day scheduled for October 28, 2022 and General Election Day on
November 8, 2022.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The cumulative biennially occurring financial impact to provide zero-fare transit on early voter day and
general election day is approximately $714,000. The average daily operational cost of providing
weekday transit service include the following:
Fare Revenue Replacement – $303,000 per weekday
Light Rail Expenses – $23,296 per day
Law Enforcement and Security – $30,695 per day
Marketing – $10,000 one-time expense
Total per day: $356,991
