Subject:

Approval of Contactless Card Contract for
SmartCard

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorizes the General Manager to execute all documents necessary to execute a contract with Giesecke
& Devrient to provide contactless smart cards (Contract 13DH023). This award is for a three-year
contract followed by two one-year options. The award amount is not-to-exceed two million dollars
($2,000,000.00).
BACKGROUND
When RTD selected the SmartCard program vendor, ACS/Xerox, it was determined that some system
and program components should be acquired through a separate competitive procurement process. The
contactless SmartCards (SmartCard media) are a major element of the SmartCard program and are
available in the open market to purchase for distribution from RTD to SmartCard users.
DISCUSSION
On July 15, 2013, RTD issued a request for proposal to acquire contactless SmartCards to provide the
card inventory to maintain the existing EcoPass and CollegePass programs and in preparation for 2014’s
MyRide fare program. The selected vendor is to provide the cards configured to work with the Xerox
system and address the necessary security provisions. On August 15th, five proposals were received:
ABnote, ASK-Int-TAG, EDM, Giesecke & Devrient and Multicard. Giesecke & Devrient was selected out
of five firms in this open-competition. Giesecke & Devrient’s proposal demonstrated a strong and
experienced team in the transportation industry and Xerox will be required to certify that the cards work
on RTD’s system. Their proposal demonstrated a low cost and a thorough understanding of the card
requirements along with comprehensive security procedures. The selection criteria for this requisition
were: Cost 60%, Experience with Transit Smart Media Production and Compliance with Specifications
25%, Strength of Security Procedures 10% and Previous Experience with Xerox / ACS 5%. Giesecke &
Devrient also had high recommendations from the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA).
Based on RTD’s estimated card usage, RTD anticipates the average cost per card to be $1.05. Cards
will be used over a five year period.
This contract provides the necessary card inventory to maintain the normal operations of the EcoPass
and CollegePass programs and preparation for next year’s MyRide implementation.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Cost to RTD for the contract period, is set at two million dollars ($2,000,000.00). Individual orders will
be placed to provide necessary card inventory as needed by RTD on a just-in-time basis. Sufficient
funding has been included in the 2014 expense budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Approve the three year contract (Contract 13DH023) with two one-year options with Giesecke &
Devrient with a not-to-exceed value of two million dollars ($2,000,000). This action provides card
inventory to maintain and expand the RTD SmartCard initiative.

2. Do not approve the contract. This is not the recommended action because the functioning of the
SmartCard system requires the availability of adequate contactless card stock for customers.
3. Require staff to issue a new RFP.

2014 Salaried Benefit Plans

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the 2014 Plan Year Salaried Insured Benefits Budget and authorize the CEO/General Manager to
enter into an agreement with the Insurance Carriers.
BACKGROUND
Annually the staff brings the proposed Salaried Employee Insured Benefits program for approval to the
Board of Directors. Approval of the program by the Board establishes the rates for Open Enrollment and
provides costs for the 2014 Budget. The Open Enrollment period for salaried staff begins October 20,
2013, and closes November 2, 2013.
DISCUSSION
The goals for the 2014 plan year are: 1) Achieve the 2014 Budget, 2) Continued focus on containing
cost and emphasis on improving health and wellness consumerism, 3) Maintain market competitiveness,
and 4) Insure compliance with PPACA – Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Health Care Reform
provisions as applicable to RTD).
Following is a summary of the modest changes for the 2014 plan year.
Medical
-

-

Cigna administers two self-funded plans on behalf of RTD. Both the PPO (Preferred Provider
Organization) Plan and the HDHP (High Deductible Health Plan) Plan have a specific individual
$150,000 stop-loss ceiling in 2014. The administrative cost will increase by 0.1% in 2014. The
Cigna Plans are expected to have approximately 460 employees enrolled. 2013 claims are running
14.3% below expected claims YTD, and 2014 claims are not projected to be higher than 2013
levels.
Kaiser provides 3 Plan Options: a fully insured HMO (Health Maintenance Organization); a DHMO
(HMO Plan with deductibles), and an HDHP. The Kaiser plans are expected to have approximately
200 employees enrolled. This plan has proposed a 3.5% blended increase over 2013.

Dental
-

No carrier/plan changes and no fixed cost increase. Delta is a self-funded plan, and has projected a
5% increase in expected claims exposure. Administrative fees are in a rate guarantee period until
2015 renewal.

Life & Disability
-

The rate guarantee with Lincoln National expired. Our renewal resulted in a 12.5% increase on our

Packet Pg. 5

1.B.2

life insurance rates. Rates for Short Term Disability, Long Term Disability, Accidental Death &
Dismemberment, and Voluntary Insurance products had no increase in premium rates.

Vision/Business Travel Accident
-

Vision Plan is currently a fully insured plan with Anthem Blue Cross – Blue Shield, and is in rate
guarantee until the 2015 Plan renewal. There are no carrier/plan changes and no costs increase
with the Business Travel Accident Plan.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The 2014 planned Salaried Employee Insured Benefit budget is projected to be a 2.9% increase over
2013 projected benefit costs. The success in cost containment is largely due to the 2010
implementation of the Cigna self-funded options and implementation of the HDHP (High Deductible
Health Plan) options in both Cigna and Kaiser. Although medical trend increases for employer-sponsored
group plans for 2014 are projected to be 10%, RTD has effectively managed to keep the salaried benefit
plan increases lower.
The major cost impacts in 2014 are due to Kaiser Premium increases of 3.5%. The net additional benefit
costs anticipated in 2013 are essentially flat. This is the fourth year we have achieved strong cost
containment as a result of our shift in carriers, plan offerings, plan design and funding models.
The 2013 estimate of the Salaried Employee Insured Benefits is $9,360,797. The projected increase of
2.9% results in an increase of $271,463 or a total projected cost of $9,632,260 in 2014. The increase
meets the projected costs in the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP). RTD’s benefit costs are below the average
for Metro area companies, which are experiencing 6-15% cost increases according to the Denver
Chamber of Commerce.
ALTERNATIVES
1.

2.

3.

It is recommended that the Financial Administration and Audit Committee recommend to the full
RTD Board of Directors that the 2014 Salaried Employee Insured Benefit Plan recommendations
be approved.
Further modify the salaried employee benefit plans to be offered in 2014. This is not
recommended since it would require significant additional negotiations with benefit providers and
delay the employee enrollment period.
Do not approve the recommended salaried employee benefit plan. This is not recommended, as
this will result in the Agency being unable to provide competitive and cost effective benefit plans
to the salaried employees.

Subject:

Proposed 2014 Fiscal Policy Statement

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
accepts the modifications to the 2014 Fiscal Policy Statement.
BACKGROUND
Proposed modifications to the Fiscal Policy Statement (the “Policy”) are brought to the Board of
Directors for approval during the year, as necessary. In addition, each year staff presents the
proposed Policy for the upcoming fiscal year for approval to the Board of Directors as an initial step
in development of the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) and Recommended Budget.
The most recent modification to the Policy was approved by the Board of Directors in February 2013
for the 2013 fiscal year. Those changes primarily related to the establishment of the FasTracks
Internal Savings Account (FISA) fund and to update the Policy with the most recent rating agency
credit ratings.
DISCUSSION
The current Policy includes the phrase “The Board of Directors will review potential fare increases
annually at the time of the development of the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP)”. In order to update the
Policy with the current practice of including fare increases in the SBP every three years to account
for inflation, this phrase has been modified as shown in the attached 2014 Proposed Fiscal Policy
Statement.
In addition, the Fund Balance Policy #6 referencing a fund to capture excess Denver Union Station
(DUS) revenue to be used for future DUS development has been removed from the Policy since the
funding for its development has been identified and development is scheduled to be completed in
2014.
All other proposed Policy policies changes are primarily wording clarification and are reflected in the
attachment.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Changing the policy as requested will not have a financial impact on the 2014 Recommended
Budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Approve the recommended changes to RTD’s 2014 Fiscal Policy Statement. Staff supports
this alternative because the changes document the policies to be adhered to in 2014 and
provide clarification of certain phrases.
2. Board further modifies the recommended changes. Staff reviewed the fiscal policies and
welcomes any suggestions for modifications requested by the Board of Directors.
3. Do not adopt the recommended changes to RTD’s 2014 Fiscal Policy Statement. This is not
recommended because RTD’s Fiscal Policy Statement would not contain all current language
and would not best facilitate the needs of RTD’s financial operations.

REVENUE POLICIES
1. Staff will plan fare adjustments every 3 years in the mid and long-term budgets to
adjust for inflation. The Board of Directors maywill considerreview potential fare
adjustmentsincreases annually at the time of the development of the Strategic
Budget Plan (SBP). As part of this process, staff will review potential fare
increases to establish a fare structure with due consideration for:
 consistency and equity throughout RTD;
 ease of use and simplicity;
 maintaining or increasing ridership and fare revenues;
 acceptability and marketability of fare structure to customers and the general
public; and
 verification and enforceability of fare payment compliance.
2. Fare policies willshould take into account the special needs of transit dependent,
elderly, youth, student, handicapped, and commuter patrons.
3. RTD will avoid dependence on temporary revenues to fund ongoing services. Onetime revenues will be used for one-time expenditures.
4. RTD will continuously explore additional sources of revenue to help balance the
budget.
5. When appropriate the Board will actively pursue legislation that would help ensure
the continued accomplishment of RTD’s goals and mission statement. The Board
will support efforts to ensure that legislative intent is realized in allocation of state
financial resources to public transit. The Board will actively oppose legislation that
would limit or diminish revenue.
6. Staff will identify on an annual basis excess property and equipment, and will
make an ongoing attempt to sell such excess property and equipment to enhance
cash flow.

INVESTMENT POLICIES
Attachment: 2014 Fiscal Policy Statement (1717 : Proposed 2014 Fiscal Policy Statement)

1. RTD will review its investment policy annually with the Board to ensure
consistency with the following objectives (in order of priority):
 safety of invested funds;
 maintenance of sufficient liquidity to meet cash flow needs; and
 attainment of the maximum yield possible consistent with the first two
objectives
2. RTD will review its investment performance on a quarterly basis with the Board.

EXPENDITURE POLICIES
1. RTD will endeavor to achieve service levels that will make the transit system easier
to use, improve travel times, and be more effective.
2. RTD will continue to look for and implement the most cost-effective and reliable
methods of delivering transportation services.
3. RTD will maintain all assets at a level that protects capital investment and
minimizes future maintenance and replacement costs.
4. RTD maintains a risk management program which will provide protection against
loss and mitigate exposure to liability.
5. A safety program will be maintained to minimize RTD's exposure to liability and
thereby reduce the number of claims against RTD.
6. RTD will develop service changes that are needed to respond to budget shortfalls
using the system-wide and route-specific productivity measures that have been
approved by the Board.

CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT POLICIES
1. RTD will prepare and update annually a six-year Strategic Budget Plan (SBP)
including projected capital construction and improvements, service levels and

2

1.B.3.a

operating costs, and revenues to fund the capital and operating programs. Capital
projects to be included in the SBP will be evaluated using the following criteria:
 total project cost (design and construction) and schedule for completion;
 source of funding;
 operating and maintenance costs for the remainder of the SBP period;
 benefits and contributions to RTD and the community, including but not limited
to the effect on future operating and maintenance costs, economy, service, and
ridership;
 consideration of alternatives (joint development, etc.); and

3. RTD will use the first year capital program from the adopted SBP as the basis for
the capital program to be included in the annual budget.
4. After completion of design of a capital project, cost estimates will be revised. If
the cost estimates exceed Delegation of Authority limits, the project will be
brought to the Board for reconsideration.
5. Facilities will be designed using current technology and allow for future
technological changes in order to be efficient and cost-effective and to protect the
public welfare.
6. RTD shall allow for multi-year capital projects to be carried forward in accordance
with the carry-forward resolution adopted by the Board.
7. RTD will prepare an annual update of the FasTracks financial plan incorporating the
actual costs incurred and the most recent available projections of capital
improvement costs, service levels, and operating costs and revenues to fund the
FasTracks capital and operating programs.

FUND BALANCE POLICIES
1. RTD will strive to maintain a fund balance in the Base System and in the FasTracks
operating budget, to provide for unanticipated expenditures of a nonrecurring
nature or to meet unexpected increases in costs. This unrestricted fund balance
3

Packet Pg. 12

1.B.3.a

Fiscal Policy Statement - effective October 223, 20143

Attachment: 2014 Fiscal Policy Statement (1717 : Proposed 2014 Fiscal Policy Statement)

will be comprised of a Board appropriated fund, a capital replacement fund and an
undesignated working capital fund as described below. For the Base System, the
total of these three funds should be maintained at an amount approximately equal
to three months of Base System operating expenses excluding depreciation. For
FasTracks, the total of these three funds should be maintained at an amount
approximately equal to two months of FasTracks operating expenses excluding
depreciation. RTD will consider and pursue resources that will be directed to fund
balance replenishment. For example, RTD may define the revenue sources that
would typically be looked to for replenishment of fund balance to include nonrecurring revenues and budget surpluses. Year-end surpluses are an especially
appropriate source for replenishing fund balance.
RTD will replenish fund balances as soon as economic conditions allow.
2. In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will designate a Board appropriated
fund balance on an annual basis. Use of the fund balance will be minimized and
occur only in specific circumstances such as severe economic downturns. With
Board approval, these funds may be used to avoid cash flow interruptions, reduce
the need for short-term borrowing, and assist in maintaining an investment-grade
bond rating. The source of replenishment of this fund will be identified and will
take place in a prompt manner.
3. In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will designate a capital replacement fund
on an annual basis. With Board approval, these funds will be used for scheduled major
vehicle replacements and other capital purchases. The source of replenishment of this
fund will be identified and will take place in a prompt manner.
4. RTD will designate excess and undesignated working capital that may accrue at
each year-end to be placed in an unrestricted fund to be used to respond to
unanticipated events.
5. RTD will maintain an emergency (TABOR) reserve equal to three percent of nonFederal revenues, as specified by Article X, Section 20 of the Colorado
Constitution.
6. RTD will maintain all revenues in excess of expenditures for Denver Union Station
in a reserve for future development of Denver Union Station as a rapid transit hub,
as specified in the intergovernmental agreement as amended on April 20, 2004.
7. The Board shall establish three reserves for future construction under the
FasTracks plan:





The FasTracks Contingency Reserve will be appropriated at a level of $30
million each year. These funds will be available to fund adjustments to the
FasTracks construction schedule, relating to logistics or cost savings
opportunities that might arise after the annual budget is adopted, and will not
be used to fund the (non-FasTracks) Bbase Ssystem capital or operating
activity.
The FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) will be used to provide funding for
future FasTracks projects that are currently unfunded. Expenditures from the FISA
will be subject to Board approval with the staff recommended project goals identified
in the Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM). Funding of the FISA will be provided from the
sources identified in the Board approved RAM and other sources approved by the
Board.
All other FasTracks funds which have not been appropriated, or otherwise
designated as reserved, in the current budget year will be maintained in a
reserve for future FasTracks capital and operating expenditures and will not be
used to fund the (non-FasTracks) Base System expenditures.

DEBT POLICIES
1. Capital projects funded through the issuance of bonds, or Certificates of
Participation (COPs) or other financial obligations shall be financed for a period not
to exceed the expected useful life of the asset.
2. Effective communication with creditbond rating agencies will be maintained, and a
policy of full disclosure on every financial report and official statementbond
prospectus will be followed.
3. Before bonded long-term debt is issued, the impact of debt service on total annual
expenditures will be analyzed.
4. DebtBond financing or COPs will not be issued to support current operating
expenditures.
It is the intent of RTD to maintain a high quality investment-grade credit rating. The
benefit of maintaining RTD's creditbond ratings at the highest reasonably attainable
level in light of current economic conditions and availability of capital funding is to
receive lower interest rates and lower debtbond or certificate insurance premiums
than would be possible with lower credit ratings. RTD’s current ratings are listed

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: October 9, 2013

From:

Terry L. Howerter, Chief Financial Officer

Date:

October 9, 2013

Board Meeting Date: October 15, 2013

Subject:

Certification of the 2014 Contribution for the
RTD Salaried Employees' Retirement Plans

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
certifies a 2014 contribution to RTD’s Salaried Employees’ Defined Benefit Pension Trust (the “DB
Plan”), which pays a specified monthly benefit at retirement, at the actuarial recommended amount of
$3.1 million. It is also recommended that the RTD Board of Directors certifies a 2014 contribution to
the Salaried Employees’ Defined Contribution Plan Trust (the “DC Plan”), which contributes a specified
amount to the plan for each year of employment, at a rate of 9% of each participant’s eligible
compensation.
BACKGROUND
In December, 2007, the RTD Board of Directors closed the DB Plan to new employees with new
employees hired on January 1, 2008 and later participating in the DC Plan. In 2013, the Board amended
the contribution to the DB Plan to a fixed annual amount of $3.1 million based on actuarial
recommendations. Previously, the DB Plan had been funded on a percentage of salaries basis. In
addition, the Board approved a contribution rate of 9% of salaries for participants in the DC Plan in
2013.
DISCUSSION
The recommended fixed annual contribution of $3.1 million to the DB Plan was determined by the plan’s
actuaries to be the annual contribution necessary to maintain a “fully funded” status for the plan. The
Board of Directors agreed that beginning in 2013, annual contributions to the DB Plan would be made at
fixed annual amounts of $3.1 million rather than as a percentage of salaries as a result of the Actuary’s
recommendations.
Section 4.1 of the RTD Salaried Employees’ DC Plan adopted by the RTD Board provides that the
Employer may, at its sole discretion, set a contribution rate between 7-9% per year for participants. The
contribution rate has been 9% each year to the DC Plan from 2008 through 2013.

The assumed contributions indicate the different amounts that would be required to fund the plan at
9%, 8% and 7% of eligible salaries in 2014.

ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended that the RTD Board of Directors certifies a 2014 contribution to RTD’s Salaried
Employees’ Pension Trust at the actuarial recommended amount of $3.1 million and Salaried
Employees’ Defined Contribution Plan Trust rate at 9% of each participant’s eligible compensation.
2. Certify an amount to be contributed to the RTD Salaried Employees’ Pension Trust and the RTD
Salaried Employees’ Defined Contribution Plan Trust at amounts other than $3.1 million and 9%
respectively.
3. Do not authorize a contribution to the RTD Salaried Employees’ Pensions. This is not
recommended because the DB Plan’s funding status would deteriorate and the liability would
increase.

Subject:

2014 Budget Update

BACKGROUND
The State of Colorado requires that a requested budget be presented to the Board and be made
available for public inspection after giving public notice in newspapers of major distribution by
October 15th of each year. RTD’s 2014 Requested Budget was presented at the Board Study
Session on September 24, 2013. Public notice will be given in the October 12-13, 2013 weekend
editions of The Denver Post and The Boulder Daily Camera. Copies of the 2014 Requested Budget
will also be made available at that time in the Board office for public inspection.
The purpose of this Board report is to update the Board with proposed changes and new information
that has become available since the presentation of the 2014 Requested Budget at the Board Study
Session. The 2014 Recommended Budget will be presented at the November Financial
Administration and Audit Committee meeting with a request to forward the budget to the Board for
adoption.
DISCUSSION
The attached power point presentation summarizes the revised assumptions incorporated into the
2014 Requested Budget and the resulting changes from the first draft of the 2014 Requested Budget
previously presented at the Board Study Session. Major revisions from the previous budget draft are
as follows:


Sales/use taxes have been revised upward based on the September CU-Leeds School
forecast. Projected sales/use tax growth rate for 2013 is revised upward from 3.7%
(June forecast) to 5.7% (September forecast) for a positive impact of $9.2 million
(combined Base System and FasTracks) for the year. For 2014, the projected sales/use
tax growth rate is also revised upward from 4.5% (June forecast) to 5.9% (September
forecast) for a combined positive impact of $16.2 million for the year.



Total District-wide operating expenses (excluding depreciation) of $497.6 million have not
materially changed from the first draft 2014 Requested Budget.



Diesel fuel is budgeted at $3.26/gallon, which is the same price that was locked in 2013
for no incremental change. At this time, the current spot price is $3.17 per gallon and the
2014 futures price is $3.21 per gallon. We anticipate that favorable opportunities to lock
a price will materialize for budget certainty.



Gasoline is budgeted at $3.54/gallon, which is the same price that was budgeted in 2013
for no incremental change.



Due to the favorable effect of the sales/use tax September forecast, the combined
unrestricted year-end fund balance is projected at $21.1 million, consisting of $16.7
million for the Base System and $4.4 million for FasTracks.
