PRESENTATION LENGTH

BACKGROUND
RTD has a 15-member Board of Directors (Board) that is directly elected by a constituency to serve fouryear terms. The Board is responsible for setting policy, overseeing the agency’s approximately $1.6
billion annual budget, and establishing short and long-range goals and plans.
RTD’s GM/CEO is responsible for implementing policy set by the Board by overseeing and directing
RTD’s daily operations, including leading an agency with approximately 3,000 employees. The GM/CEO
is also responsible for leading the execution of RTD’s Strategic Plan and represents RTD as its chief
executive to the public and works in collaboration with the Board.
The Board adopted a revised GM/CEO Compensation Philosophy in September 2023, which informs
RTD’s compensation practices with respect to the GM/CEO.
In alignment with the aforementioned, the GM/CEO Compensation Philosophy and supported by
recommendations detailed in a 2022 Compensation Study of the GM/CEO position, the Board adopted a
base compensation pay band in October 2023.
Further, in January 2024, the Board adopted a GM/CEO Performance Assessment Framework to support
the annual performance evaluation process for the GM/CEO position.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
2024 Performance Committee Work Plan

March 4, 2024

BOARD REPRESENTATIVE
Peggy Catlin, Performance Committee Chair
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 minutes
BACKGROUND
During the January 30, 2024, regular Board of Directors meeting, the Board approved a Bylaws
amendment calling for each standing committee of the Board to draft and approve an annual work plan.
Annual committee work plans are a useful tool for ensuring the Board and staff collaborate effectively to
accomplish the necessary work of the agency and Board, while providing dedicated space for the Board
to pursue governance/policy objectives and gain further insights into matters of interest to Directors.
Work plans elevate and respect the role of the committees of the Board as some of the most effective
forums for completing the work of the Board.
Per the Board’s Bylaws (Article VI, Section 1, f.), the Performance Committee “is responsible for
performance management of the General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) and the GM/CEO’s contract and
annual comprehensive performance evaluation, as well as monitoring metrics as to the agency’s
performance related to the Strategic Plan success outcomes.”
DISCUSSION
This discussion item aligns with the Strategic Priorities of Community Value, Customer Excellence,
Employee Ownership, and Financial Success, as the Performance Committee’s ability to effectively work
with the GM/CEO impacts the overall performance of the agency. A solid committee work plan will
ensure RTD’s resources are used efficiently, and that the Board and GM/CEO foster effective
communication and progress towards the agency’s goals.
The Committee is asked to review the attached draft work plan and gain an understanding of the
committee’s workflow based on the items currently listed. Additionally, the Directors should provide
input on items they would like to see included in the work plan that are not already included in the draft
document.
One item that has been widely discussed by the Board, including at the Board’s retreat on February 24,
2024, is the adoption of agency-wide performance metrics. At this time, the work plan does not contain
any planned discussion or action related to agency-wide performance metrics. Additionally, the draft

Packet Pg. 6

1.D.1

work plan was compiled based on the meeting calendar published and disseminated in October 2023.
That calendar was based on the discussion the Committee had on September 11, 2023, regarding the
2024 GM/CEO Proposed Performance Assessment Process Timeline. The Committee Chair and
Committee Vice Chair, with the concurrence of the GM/CEO, intend to hold additional meetings on an
approximately monthly basis in 2024. As such, the work plan will need to be adjusted to include planned
agenda items for the additional 2024 meetings that have been calendared.
Following the discussion, the GM/CEO will work with the Board Chair as well as the Committee Chair
and Vice Chair to further refine the work plan. The Committee will then review the work plan for
approval at its next meeting, currently scheduled for April 1, 2024.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with this discussion item.
