## V. Public Participation

Chair Tisdale stated that the public participation period was open to anyone who wanted to speak. He explained that elected officials were invited to speak first, and others would be called in the order they signed up, and then additional speakers would be invited at the end of the list. He reminded the audience that each speaker was allowed three minutes and to approach the lectern when called and state their name and address. Chair Tisdale asked that if any speaker had documentation or reference materials for the Board to give those materials to the Board staff prior to speaking.

Roger Harris, Denver, requested that the Board provide him and other operators with safety and protection.  He stated that operating a bus was dangerous and that RTD needed to do more to protect operators not only from verbal assaults but also from physical threats that continue to be an ongoing issue to operators. Mr. Harris offered some solutions to adding protection such as smart readers for collecting fares, operator plexiglass enclosures, and added security on buses.

Jamie Perkins, Denver, stated that she was grateful to be at the Board Meeting to speak about the Pass Program Working Group (PPWG). She added that she appreciated that RTD had convened the PPWG and for the effort that had gone into a thoughtful analysis of a pass program. Ms. Jenkins stated that she recommended that passes be provided for people who lived at 185% of the federal poverty level. She explained that early in her career she had qualified for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program that was instrumental in allowing her to become successful. Ms. Jenkins stated that providing transportation assistance would add to RTD ridership and give many people the opportunity to become successful and thriving members of the community. She added that public transportation was an important part of community lives and that the recommended low-income passes would be vital to many communities. Ms. Jenkins stated that she would like the Board to endorse the recommended low-income passes.

David Martin, Denver, stated that he represented all residents along the University of Colorado A Line and urged RTD to find an alternative to end the constant train horns while waiting for the implementation of quiet zones to mitigate noise impacts. Mr. Martin asked how RTD planned to solve the train horn issue if the CPUC did not allow implementation of quiet zones at the rail crossings. He also requested that RTD respond to his email regarding this issue. Mr. Martin also asked why there was only one left-hand turn lane at 40th Avenue and Colorado Boulevard, when based on the East Corridor Record of Decision, two left turn lanes had been required.

Clay Moore, Denver, stated that last two years he had been a bus operator out of East Metro and that it had been a unique and challenging experience. He added that he was at the Board Meeting to explain that there was a crisis with the shortage of drivers and many negative characteristics regarding the job causing low driver morale. Mr. Moore stated that wages did not keep pace with cost of living in Denver. He added that RTD operator shortages resulted in routes being dropped every day, drivers being mandated, and low morale. Mr. Moore stated that all these problems would be fixed with a 10% increase in wages.

Andrea Chrirboga-Flor, Denver, stated that she worked for 9-5 Colorado and stated that her group supported of the 50% pass discount. She stated that, with the lost service hours, shortage of drivers, and the changes in service to new lines, the agency’s priority should be to keep and expand ridership rather than add more trains through the completion of FasTracks. Ms. Chrirboga-Flor stated that fare increases cause a decrease in ridership and that funding should come from other outside sources rather than riders. She added that RTD should focus on those who depend on RTD services and increasing ridership.

Janae Donaldson, Denver, stated that fare increases hurt the drivers, that 90% of driver assaults happen because of fare disputes, and a fare increase will only cause more safety and ridership issues. She added that cutting routes hurts drivers and causes riders to find other transportation methods. Ms. Donaldson stated that RTD was a public service and not a business and that people were hurt by decisions made by the Board.

General Manager Genova explained the Collective Bargaining Negotiations (CBA) are ongoing but that one of the most interesting developments was that the Department of Labor denied the union the right to strike and ruled that, if an agreement could not be reached, negotiations would move to binding arbitration. He stated that RTD and CBA continued to work through the final pieces of the negotiations and hoped to reach a resolution soon.

General Manager Genova thanked all the stakeholders and staff for their hard work and commitment to the Pass Program Working Group (PPWG).

He thanked Michael Washington, Transit Equity Manager, for leading the PPWG and working hard with all members to develop a good model and process.

Director Menten asked if an invitation to apply to bus driver positions was presented during the PPWG meetings as reminder to all stakeholders of the need for operators.

Director Menten asked about Mr. Martin’s question during public participation about what the agency would do if the CPUC came back with an unfavorable decision regarding the quiet zones.

General Manager Genova stated that RTD would have to wait to see what the decision was before taking secondary measures to address noise impacts, because there were several secondary options to consider.

Director Sisk thanked Michael Washington and RTD staff as to how they handled expressing their views at the District O open house.

Director Lubow also thanked Michael Washington and asked RTD staff to reach out to constituents regarding solutions for the quiet zones.

Director Walker offered his support to all operators and the challenges that they deal with during their workday.

### E. Recommended Changes to Special Event Services

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors approve the following changes to Special Event services:

1. Discontinue RockiesRide bus service and authorize staff to develop alternative service configurations to serve Longmont and Wagon Road/Thornton on Rockies games weekends; and

2. Discontinue RTD RACE service to the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure event.

BACKGROUND

1.       RockiesRide - Major League Baseball expanded to include the Colorado Rockies in 1993 and RockiesRide service began that same year.  The service operated with 12 routes to 23 Park-n-Rides and ran approximately 175 buses to all home games.  Over the years, service levels have been adjusted to better match ridership. In 2017, the service was reduced to just two routes serving four Park-n-Rides (8th & Coffman and 815 South Main in Longmont and Wagon Road and Thornton park-n-Rides).  Service operated on Opening Day, for Saturday and Sunday games, and for fireworks games; most games operated with six buses.  In 2017, there were an average of 472 boardings per game (approximately 236 RTD passengers) for the two routes. In 2015, RockiesRide service operated at a $16.84 subsidy per passenger boarding versus $5.15 subsidy per boarding for BroncosRide service that same year. In 2016, RockiesRide service operated at a cost per boarding of $20.96 versus a cost per boarding of $10.07 for BroncosRide service. Costs for 2017 have not yet been calculated pending the final close of the 2017 financial books.

Since the opening of Coors Field, the Colorado Rockies have allowed RockiesRide buses to use the parking lot located on the corner of Wazee St. and 22nd Ave. (Rockies-Lot) to board and de-board passengers.  In November 2017, the Colorado Rockies notified RTD the Rockies-Lot would no longer be available.  Due to construction, the Colorado Rockies are required to relocate parking from another location to the Rockies-Lot.  RockiesRide is no longer able to use the parking lot as it has used for the past 24 years.

Due to the loss of parking at Coors Field, any bus service for passengers desiring to attend Rockies games will be need to terminate at Denver Union station as do other RTD bus services from the north metro area. Therefore, it is recommended that “RockiesRide” service as a free standing branded sports ride service be discontinued and staff be authorized to develop alternative service configurations to serve Longmont and Thornton areas on Rockies game weekends in order to serve the ridership that does exist, especially on Sundays where no alternative service exists.

2.       RACE - RTD began offering RACE Service to the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure event on October 3rd, 1999. That year, the service operated with 20 buses from three (3) Park-n-Rides.  Race for the Cure attendance peaked at 65,350 in 2006.  Peak boardings for RACE Service occurred in 2005 (12,671) and has generally ranged between 8,000 and 12,000 from 2001 and 2011.  In 2017, Race for the Cure attendance dipped to 10,200 and RACE Service boardings dropped to an all-time low of 786 (approximately 393 RTD passengers).  As Race for the Cure participation has declined, RTD boardings have followed suit.

It is recommended that RACE Service to the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure event be discontinued due to low ridership and levels of event participation do not meet RTD service standards.

DISCUSSION

1.       RockiesRide - The Colorado Rockies offered to assist RTD in securing access to 21st St. between Blake and Market for RockiesRide use to compensate for the loss of the Rockies-Lot parking. After looking at this location, bus operations staff raised concerns as the location limits the number of buses that can be used.  Moreover, it constricts operations as driveways and alleys need to remain clear. This location will not work for RTD operations. In addition, RTD service standards require a minimum attendance of 40,000 persons in one location at one time to warrant consideration for special event bus service. While previous attendance at Coors Field met this standard, recent attendance figures would not meet the standard for special event bus service. Average attendance at Coors Field for the 2017 season was 36,465.

Alternative service exists on the Routes 120X and LD/LX for customers on Weekdays and Saturdays.  No alternative service is available on Sundays and this reinforces the recommendation to authorize staff to develop alternative service configurations to provide access to downtown Denver on Rockies game weekends, especially Sunday, from the areas previously served by weekend RockiesRide service.

2.       RACE Service - The RTD service standard for event service requires 40,000 participants in one place at one time.  The 2017 Race for the Cure event participation (10,200) does not meet the RTD service standard of 40,000 persons in one place at one time.

Alternative service exists on the Flat Iron Flyer for customers traveling from US36 & Table Mesa and US-36 & McCaslin.  No alternative service is available for passengers traveling from Wagon Road and US-85 & Bridge.

Two public meetings were held on February 5 at 12:00 noon and 6:00 pm at the RTD Administrative Offices.  Listed below is a summary of the comments received at the public meetings and via phone and email:

Monday, February 5, 2018

RTD Administrative Offices

12:00 noon

Staff in attendance included Dan Menter and Jessie Carter.  There were six members from the public in attendance, five of whom attended because of the RockiesRide proposed service changes. Comments included the following:

- Concern for the elderly and ADA passengers who could not otherwise get to the game

- Sports-rides should be better marketed

- Perhaps use RockiesRide buses to back up regular service and add Sunday service on the route L

- Jessie Carter addressed the individual who attended the meeting to share comments regarding the route L and the 27 following the discussion of the RockiesRide service

No one in attendance spoke regarding the proposed elimination of the Race for the Cure service.

Monday, February 5, 2018

RTD Administrative Offices

6:00 pm

Staff in attendance included Dan Menter, Jessie Carter and Jonathan Wade.  There were three members from the public in attendance, all of whom attended because of the RockiesRide proposed service changes.  None of the attendees requested to speak or provide input at the meeting.

No one attended on behalf of Race for the Cure proposed service changes.

RTD staff received one phone call and three emails regarding the RockiesRide proposed service changes.  Those comments are summarized below:

- Phone (1): Phone conversation suggested RTD keep Saturday and Sunday only RockiesRide Service.

- Email (3):  Two emails were in support of RockiesRide claiming ridership from Longmont was good and/or full.  A third email shared several comments:

o        Scheduled service alternatives are very limited and inconvenient on Saturdays and non-existent on Sundays

o        RTD does not market anything

o        RTD requirement that buses wait 45 minutes after the game has a negative impact on ridership

o        RTD should consider an alternative loading/unloading location, i.e., layover in Union Station and then load at top of Wewatta ramp post game

o        Need a free shuttle between DUS and a convenient location near Wewatta and Park Avenue

o        Fares should be collected in both directions

o        RockiesRide service should be a scheduled service, not a Special Service

o        RTD needs to do a better job protecting for overloads on game days on the FF service

o        RTD should contemplate how to generate more boardings systemwide, rather than cutting services that people actually use

FINANCIAL IMPACT

1.       RockiesRide – Eliminating the service saves approximately $108,000 annualized. Some of this funding will be required to provide alternative service from the areas affected by the elimination of service.

2.       RACE – Eliminating the service saves approximately $16,800 annualized.

ALTERNATIVES:

1.              Discontinue RockiesRide bus service and authorize staff to develop alternative service configurations to serve Longmont and Wagon Road/Thornton on Rockies games weekends and discontinue RTD RACE service to the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure event. This is the recommended alternative.

2. RockiesRide - Run the service out of Union Station.  This alternative is not recommended because on opening day and fireworks games RTD does not have the capacity to operate the service and the service would duplicate existing service on the route L and the 120X, on all days except Sundays. In addition, the service would not the minimum requirements of RTD’s adopted service standards.

3.              Race for the Cure – the existing service could be maintained but this alternative is not recommended as it would be in violation of RTD service standards and has generated very low ridership in recent years.

Prepared by:

Brian Matthews, Manager, Special Services

Motion:               Director Solano made the motion to approve the Recommended Changes to Special Event Services.

Director Archuleta seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Director Hoy asked whether RTD would be supplementing the Rockies Ride from the Wagon Road Park-n-Ride with additional 120X buses. He added that the ridership from that area quoted in the report warranted the additional service.

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Operations, stated that the average ridership numbers on Saturdays from Wagon Road and Longmont were 103 and 63. He added that the average ridership on Sundays were 118 and 100, respectively. Mr. Abel stated that it was staff’s intent for people from Longmont to use the LD on Saturday and for RTD to provide additional bus support as needed. He said RTD would provide a special freestanding service on Sundays.He explained that from Wagon Road customers would use the 120X to get to Union Station on Saturdays and RTD would provide a special freestanding service on Sundays.

Director Hoy requested clarification on the word “intent” and asked if that meant the agency would provide the additional service.

Mr. Abel explained that RTD would provide the additional service.

Director Broom asked how the public would be alerted to the changes and the elimination of the routes.

Mr. Abel explained that RTD Communications Department would publicize the changes and promote the utilization of existing services and communicate that special services would run on Sunday.

Director Broom asked if the Colorado Rockies organization would communicate the changes to their ticket holders.

Mr. Abel stated that he was unable to speak for the Colorado Rockies organization.

Director Lubow stated that Longmont constituents were not happy with the change but understood the need to terminate the service because it was not being utilized. She asked how the agency would handle buses that operated at capacity.

Mr. Abel explained that RTD would back up the service during high volume time. He added that RTD continually backs up service during times of peak ridership.

Director Lubow how RTD would handle providing rides if a game went past scheduled service times.

Mr. Abel explained that RTD would have a contingency plan that would determine providing additional or extended service.

Director Hoy declared trusted that staff to notify and take care of RTD passengers and that he would be voting yes.
