B. Recommended Actions
There were no recommended actions.

C. Updates

• Local Update - CRL & Associates
Roger Sherman, CRL Associates, said that his report in the Board packet
covered the discussions surrounding the legislative transportation sales tax.
He said that the Metro Mayors Caucus (MMC) and a separate coalition
working on the issue would come to decisions that week, and he anticipated
that ballot titles would be filed as well. He highlighted the upcoming
Colorado Counties, Inc. (CCI) and Colorado Municipal League (CML)
conferences and said that the Board would find the conferences to be
beneficial. He added that CRL Associates would host a dinner during the
CML conference.
Director Lubow said that Mr. Sherman’s report spoke about a letter from
MMC and asked for clarification on what MMC was requesting.
Mr. Sherman replied that the coalition had agreed to a distribution formula of
45% for the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT), 15% for a new
multimodal fund, and 40% split evenly between cities and counties. He said
MMC wanted to request a $.01 tax in the ballot measure, though he noted
there was some opposition from the rest of the state. He stated that, if the
tax rate in the proposal came in less than $.01, MMC wanted to reduce the
amount that would go to CDOT to 35% in order to maintain the level of
funding to local jurisdictions. He said that MMC requested that proportional
changes be made if the proposed tax is set at $.005 or $.0062, which was
the rate proposed in House Bill 17-1242.
Director Lubow asked Mr. Sherman to explain the sales tax distribution chart
to her offline.

6.A

Director Menten asked whether the ballot measure would only result in
statutory changes, and Mr. Sherman responded that was correct.

Julie McKenna, Brandeberry~McKenna Public Affairs (BBMK), said that
Senator Bob Gardner and Representative K.C. Becker had introduced Senate
Bill 18-088 (SB088), which aimed to correct the drafting error in Senate Bill
17-267, which eliminated the ability of the Scientific and Cultural Facilities
District (SCFD), RTD, and other special districts to collect taxes on marijuana
sales. She said the House Finance Committee heard the bill the previous day
and that it would be heard on the House floor that week, where it would
wrap up quickly. She said that state legislators were also working on their
own transportation measures while the ballot questions were being ironed
out. Specifically, she said that Senate Bill 18-001 (SB001), regarding
transportation bonds, centered on bonding using state general fund dollars.
She said that SB001 was the main legislative vehicle at the time but said
there would be others.
Megan Wagner, BBMK, said there was a stakeholder group looking at a bill
to create a true one call system. She said that BBMK was participating in
those conversations to make sure that RTD’s concerns would be addressed.
She said the bill would likely be introduced the following day.
Director Lubow asked how well SB088 was passing through the legislative
process.
Ms. McKenna responded that everything was going very well. She said that,
following the special legislative session in 2017, the direction was to
formulate a solution in a different way. She added that SB088 had 18
Senate and 33 House cosponsors, enough votes to ensure its passage.

• Federal Update - Squire Patton Boggs
Mike Dino, Squire Patton Boggs (SPB) said that the federal government was
operating under a continuing resolution (CR) and stated the House had
recently passed a continuing resolution to fund the government through
March 23, 2018. He noted that the House version of the resolution fully
funded the Department of Defense (DoD). He added that the Senate was
closing in on a deal that would fund the federal government for the following
two fiscal years, though he noted the vote on that legislation would not take
place before the expiration of the existing CR on Thursday, February 8,
2018. He said that the Senate would likely remove the additional DoD
funding authorized by the House. He noted that the President had stated
that he would not sign any funding legislation that did not deal with
immigration and was comfortable with the federal government entering
another shutdown. He said the House and Senate could agree to another sixPacket Pg. 6

week CR extension. Mr. Dino stated that SPB’s report covered the pending
infrastructure plan, which he said the White House planned to release on
February 12, 2018. He said there were questions about long-term
transportation funding and noted that, in the GOP retreat the previous week,
House Transportation Committee Chair Bill Shuster stated his interest
increasing the balance of the Highway Trust Fund. He said Rep. Shuster
identified a raise in the gas tax as a way of achieving that.

Mr. Dino stated that he thought that was correct.
Director Folska said that it should be easy for Congress to raise that tax,
because Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell had been able to do so even with
a state legislature controlled by Republicans. She asked by how much Rep.
Shuster intended to raise the tax.
Mr. Dino said that the proposal was not specific and noted that a portion of
the House Republican caucus would not listen to the proposal. He said he
was not sure how much traction the proposal would receive.
Director Archuleta asked whether there was any validity in the President’s
announcement during the recent State of the Union Address that he
intended to put $1.3 trillion into infrastructure.
Mr. Dino said that the President wanted to put the onus on local and state
governments to come up with the seed money. He said that RTD, for
example, was able to win a full funding grant agreement (FFGA) because the
agency committed 50% of the funding for the project, whereas most
contemporaneous state and local projects offered only 20%, which made
RTD more competitive. He said the President indicated that state and local
project would have to commit to 80% of the funding for a project, while the
federal government would supply the remaining. He said that such a
financing structure was a heavy lift for state and local projects but said that,
in some ways, that was the reality for the transportation industry.

D. Other Matters
Director Menten mentioned that one of RTD’s properties was located next to the
Federal Center Station. She said that 59 acres of federal land would soon be
auctioned off by the federal government and that, pursuant to the McKinney-Vento
Homeless Assistance Act, agencies that provide assistance to homeless populations
had first rights to auctioned federal land. She noted that a portion of the land was
contaminated because of its prior use as a federal munitions plant. She said that
the auction was held up in the courts at that time but said that 500-600 units of
transitional housing would potentially be erected on the site. She said that quite a

Director Folska asked whether the current federal excise tax on gasoline was
still $.185 cents per gallon.

6.A

few local elected officials were not happy with the situation. She asked that staff
contact her offline to explain RTD’s posture with regard to its property in that
location.

Director Menten added that the housing assistance agencies would not initially have
the money to build typical housing structures and that they had described building
something akin to igloos instead. She said that it may be some time before there
would be enough money to build permanent structures on the site.

B. Recommended Actions

• Transit Oriented Development Evaluation Guidelines
It is recommended by the Planning, Capital Programs and FasTracks
Committee that the Board of Directors approve the attached Resolution
Number
(the “Resolution”), the “Transit Oriented Development
Evaluation Guidelines” to provide policy direction to RTD staff on evaluating
transit oriented development (TOD) projects moving forward.
Motion:

Director Solano made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the February 27, 2018
Board Meeting.
Director Anderson seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Motion
to Amend:

Bill Sirois, Senior Manager of Transit Oriented Communities,
stated that he wanted to point out a few items included in the
Board Report. He noted that a few slides had been included to
help the Board remember what had been established such as
the
purpose,
standards
for
projects,
and
the
categories/elements of the guidelines. He remarked that the
first conversation had taken place at the end of October with
additional input from the Board in December.

Director Anderson said that she would like one change made
to item number 3, and that a sentence be added that would
state, “In cases where a sale is considered, RTD should take
such actions that will preserve RTD’s long-term interest”. She
said the reason she wanted the addition was because RTD
uses Transit Oriented Development (TOD) to increase ridership
which is needed throughout the entire system. She added that
Packet Pg. 10

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 6, 2018 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Deadwyler was absent.

6.B

she would like this sentence included so that the agency can
hold entities or jurisdictions to their word over issues that may
arise.
Director Broom seconded the motion.
Director Hoy asked for Director Anderson to repeat her
statement one more time, which she did.

Director Anderson commented that the intent was there but
the words were not.
Director Folska, Ph.D., asked why Director Anderson used the
word “should” instead of “shall”.
Director Anderson commented that someone with legal
knowledge wrote the sentence for her. She said that she
would defer to RTD’s legal team if they thought other words
would make it stronger.
Rolf Asphaug, General Counsel, noted that he was not
involved in the drafting of Director Anderson’s sentence, but
he noted that in paragraph 1, it discussed factors that should
be considered.
Director Folska stated that the word “should” was weak and
asked why RTD would bother having the resolution.
Mr. Asphaug explained that “should” was an appropriate word
to use. He noted that “shall” could be useful if staff were
trying to ensure another party was doing what they were
supposed to do.
Committee Chair Lubow remarked that she did not understand
the need for the resolution. She said that this would not harm
anything but asked what this change would do.
Mr. Sirois noted that, based on past staff experiences,
Director Anderson was trying to alleviate a future situation
where staff would have worked with a jurisdiction for a
process or plan that ended up being changed by the other
party. He said that her addition would allow RTD to hold their
Packet Pg. 11

Director Hoy commented that the addition did not sound too
onerous and that was what RTD would want to do anyway.

feet to the fire and if staff can get their promises included in
an agreement it would also help to hold them accountable.
Director Broom equated Director Anderson’s addition to a deed
restriction. He commented that staff would have to reduce the
price or risk having a buyer walk away from the project.

Director Menten asked Mr. Asphaug his opinion on a property
in question in Arvada. She asked what this amendment would
do if the city council voted down a developer’s request to
build a taller structure.
Mr. Asphaug said that it was difficult to comment on
something like that. He explained that this resolution would
advise staff on what they should be taking into account when
dealing with that type of situation.
Mr. Sirois added that it would also depend on the hook that
was negotiated with the local jurisdiction.
Director Menten noted that the deal in Arvada included a
parking garage.
General Manager Genova explained that overall the question
was about how the resolution would impact a decision by a
city council. He explained that the resolution would not have a
large impact, but it would provide guidance to staff on how to
pursue TOD projects, while also telling others who want to do
TOD business with RTD what the agency’s guidelines are. He
said that the resolution would be important in terms of TOD in
the future.

Chair Tisdale remarked that RTD would want to have a

relates to TOD. He said it made sense because it would give
staff flexibility for transactions.

Director Williams stated that, though she was going to ask Mr.
Sirois to summarize the whole thing in one sentence, the
General Manager did an excellent job of expressing the point
of this procedure, and she thanked him for that.

Director Menten explained that she was a no vote because she
would prefer to sell land to developers who would create
property taxes for the district.
Director Folska, Ph.D., added that for years staff had been
telling the Board that, when ridership was down, it directly
correlated to gas prices, as opposed to TOD.

• Contract Amendment; 1st year (2018) option 2017-2019 Street
Improvements & Shelter Installations Contract # 37DM002
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee
that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his
designee to execute all documents necessary to award a Contract
Amendment to initiate the first option year (2018) of a three-year contract
for the annual Street Improvements & Shelter Installation contract with
Manion Construction, Inc. for $371,409.75. Funding for this Contract
Amendment is provided by the annual 2018 Capital Programs Expense

efforts, system ridership was down.

amendment. He explained that the contract was publicly
advertised last spring and the motion tonight was for the first
of two one-year options. He said that the primary function of
the contractor was to provide street improvements, bus pads,
sidewalks, bus stop enhancements, ADA improvements, and
other work as needed. He said that staff worked with the
service-planning department to identify stops that need
improvements and noted that RTD did a wide variety of
improvements and emergency repairs. He added that this was
the vendor’s third contract with RTD and that he did quality
work that was fairly priced. He further added that staff
enjoyed working with the contractor and he helped RTD a lot.
Director Folska, Ph.D., asked if staff had resolved the issue
with the braille at Civic Center Station.
Henry Stopplecamp, Assistant General Manager of Capital
Programs, said yes and noted that the two signs had been
fixed. He added that staff was currently working on signage
outside of that process.
Director Folska, Ph.D., inquired if there was a clearly defined
space for paratransit and Access-a-Cab riders.
Mr. Stopplecamp stated that at Civic Center Station the first
gate was used for paratransit riders.
General Manager Genova commented that the designated area
for paratransit riders was on the 16th Street Mall, but he would
follow up with Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus
Operations, regarding the Access-a-Cab drop off area. He
noted that, in regards to the braille signage, all of the
requirements had been completed.
Director Anderson noted that last Friday, she attended a round
table discussion with a mixture of people. She said that one of
the things she found interesting was that an individual who
never used public transportation spoke out quite forcefully
about people waiting in snowstorms at bus stops. She said
that it speaks volumes that people who never ride the bus or
take the train do pay attention to how people are treated at
bus stops.

C. Updates
Mr. Sirois stated that Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager of Planning,
was out ill, so he and Michael Washington, Transit Equity Manager, would
present this time.
Mr. Washington noted that this would be a redundant review for the Board,
and he would bypass the first few slides and move to the December meeting
recap. He said that, at the December meeting, the Pass Program Working
Group (PPWG) went in with three options and left with one. He noted that
group saw that options B and C resulted in loses of revenue and ridership
and the decision was to move forward with option E. He stated the group
had asked for two variations of that option which would become options Y
and Z.
Mr. Washington commented that, for the January meeting:
• It was well attended by the public and many commenters voiced
strong support for a Youth Program and Low-Income Program
• Discussed and eliminated Option Y due to projected ridership and
revenue losses
• Agreed on primary elements of Option Z
• Preserve: EcoPass, CollegePass, Nonprofit Program and
FlexPass
• Create: Youth Program, Low-Income Program, bulk purchase
discount
• Used last two meetings to answer remaining questions:
• Discounts and Surcharges: Could discounts in one program be
offset by surcharges on another program?
• Low-Income Program: What percentage of discount? What
was the definition of “low-income” (e.g. $45,000 in annual
household income)?
• Youth Program: What level of discount? 12 and under free?
• Minimize increases to base fares?
Mr. Washington noted that there was a PPWG meeting earlier in the day
where other details of the program were discussed. He said that the group

would be on whatever decision came out of the group. She added that there
was a 30-minute open session before each meeting where a number of
advocate groups spoke, but they did not stay for the entire meeting, so their
knowledge of what happened at the meetings was skewed. She thanked
everyone for all of their hard work and said she would be interested to see
what happened in the final meeting.
Director Menten noted that in the presentation, the definition of what was
considered “low-income” had yet to be determined. She asked for an
explanation of how that number would be reached.
Mr. Washington explained that the group was using the federal poverty
guidelines. He said the group decided the appropriate level was 185% of the
federal poverty guidelines and for the Denver metro area would be
equivalent to $45,000 for a household of three.
Director Menten asked what that figure would equate to in terms of RTD’s
ridership.
Mr. Washington stated that 41% of RTD’s ridership would be considered
low income.
Director Broom asked if staff could elaborate on what a bulk purchase would
be.
Mr. Washington said that the group had not gotten to that level yet. He
noted that, when conferences are held in town, there was always a large
request for tickets and some group members were looking at a discount for
that. He said that, if he had to channel the intent of bulk purchases, it would
be a purchase of 100 or more passes.
Director Hoy commented that the goal of the PPWG was not to subsidize
more passengers. He stated that under option E there was a youth provision,
but that would need to be subsidized by someone other than RTD.

was close to hammering out the final details for a recommendation and the
group had been able to see what they could reasonably make a decision on
versus what they could not. He explained that it was a complex process and
the group was finding a deeper understanding of how RTD worked and how
the agency made it decisions. He added that this process had allowed RTD
to have a more constructive conversation about what RTD could and could
not do.

6.B

Mr. Washington explained that the proposed youth discount was 70%,
whereas the current discount was 50%. He said the revenue change for
youth passes would be negligible, but the bigger swings in revenue come
from employer programs and low-income passes. He added that the PPWG
had been told that the recommendation had to be fiscally responsible and it
must meet RTD’s Strategic Budget Plan (SBP).

Mr. Washington said that RTD had made it very clear to the PPWG that RTD
cannot complete the means testing for low-income passes.
Director Folska, Ph.D., said that this was a challenging situation, which
brought up nightmares from increasing the fares a few years ago. She added
that RTD should not give a discount to people coming to Denver for
conferences or conventions.
Director Walker asked if the proposed discounts would be a fixed amount or
a percentage.
Mr. Washington stated that it had been discussed as a percentage.
Director Walker inquired if there had been any discussion about the debt-toincome ratio for low-income passes. He noted that the level of income was
relative to the debt the household had.
Committee Chair Lubow remarked that it seemed to her that RTD gave some
people an extra discount while taking other discounts away and added that
the Eco-Pass had been accused of being inequitable for some time.
Mr. Washington commented that the recent changes to the Eco-Pass made it
revenue neutral.
Director Williams stated that, between the mandatory discounts to the
disabled and seniors, the non-profit pass program, the Eco-Pass Program,
and youth and low-income constituents, 81% of RTD’s ridership would
receive some type of discount. She said that what is being proposed by the
PPWG was a whole lot of discounts for many people. She added that there
had been misinformation about who would complete the low-income
verifications and noted that RTD was not a human service entity and
therefore could not do those types of verifications.
General Manager Genova said that the RTD Board would determine what
they want to do with the PPWG recommendation either by adopting all of it,
parts of it, or not adopting it at all. He noted that the recommendation made

Director Hoy noted that, when this group started out, RTD did not want to
have any responsibility to vet people who qualified for low-income passes.

by the PPWG would go to him and the senior leadership team for analysis
before it would be presented to the Board. He highlighted that the
recommendation would not be an RTD recommendation, but a PPWG
recommendation.
Chair Tisdale said that it would be beneficial if the PPWG provided the RTD
Board with alternatives to consider.

Director Hoy explained that everyone needed to remember that people
getting on the bus at full fare were being subsidized. He said that there was
already a healthy discount, and if it was discounted further, RTD would be in
trouble. He said this was not where he thought the PPWG was going to go.
Committee Chair Lubow thanked everyone for their hard work and noted
that she had a better understanding of the equities between the various
passes.

• Southwest Chief & Front Range Passenger Rail Commission
Mr. Sirois explained that Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager of
Planning, was RTD’s representative on the commission. He said that:
 Senate Bill 17-153 created the Southwest Chief (SW Chief) and Front
Range Passenger Rail Commission, directing the Commission to:
o Continue Amtrak SW Chief Line track rehabilitation, expansion
to Pueblo, and consider adding service to Walsenburg, AND
o Report to the Colorado General Assembly by December 1,
2017, regarding proposals for the development of a Front
Range passenger rail system
− Commission continues statutory purpose beyond that date
− Authority to receive & expend funds
He added that:
 Commission appointments were finalized in July, 2017, and the
Commission has been housed by CDOT:
o Two freight railroad industry representatives
o Five representatives from the Councils of Government
(COGs)/Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) in the
Front Range
o RTD representative (Bill Van Meter)
o Two statewide passenger rail advocates
o SW Chief representative, and
o Non-voting representatives from CDOT and Amtrak

Director Menten stated that she agreed with Director Hoy and that
examining low-income passes was not the Board’s intent for the PPWG.

6.B

He said that:
 Commission identified five distinct phases for delivery of Front Range
passenger rail to the citizens of Colorado
o Define the Service union
 Conceptual Cost: $8.7 million
 Timeframe: 1-2.5 years
o Formation of Governing Authority
 Conceptual Cost: $.5 million
 Timeframe: 2.5-4 years
o Federal Project Development Process
 Conceptual Cost: $150-300 million
 Timeframe: 4-6 years
o Final Design and Construction
 Conceptual Cost: TBD
 Timeframe: 7-15 years
o Ribbon Cutting
He noted that issues to consider were:
 Target Markets
 Public Engagement
 Technology
 Alignment
 Service & Operating Characteristics
 Costs
 Potential Funding Options
 Goverance Structure & Service Operator
 Regulatory Environment
 SWC and FRPR Commission Considerations
 Potential Legislative Request
 Commission’s next steps
He remarked that:
 Funding for First Project Phase - $8.7 million ($2.9 million/year)
o Conduct public and stakeholder engagement throughout the
Front Range
 Define mobility needs, who will be served
 Define/confirm vision for front range passenger rail

He added that:
 At the January 9, 2018 Commission Meeting, the Commission
requested that RTD and the COG’s / MPO’s Boards consider
Resolutions and/or other actions:
o In support of the proposed multi-phase approach proposed by
the Commission, AND
o In support of the Commission’s request to the Legislature for
funding for the first phase - $8.7 million ($2.9 million / year)
Director Anderson said that, before she could vote on a recommendation,
she would need to have more information. She asked if staff had any idea
what the potential amount of ridership would be.
Mr. Sirois said he would have to get back to the Board with that
information.
Director Broom said that years ago, he sat in on one of the studies executed
by Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) and their estimated
costs were astronomical and ridership was projected to be low. He said that
he never could have envisioned how this type of rail service would work
until the population of Colorado tripled. He recommended that staff review
the previous studies that had been done which were deemed inconclusive,
and the Board should review them too before voting on a position.
Director Folska, Ph.D., commented that this was a bad idea and RTD might
shoot itself in the foot by supporting this item.
Director Hoy added that there could be political ramifications for supporting
this and there was a lot more at stake than just the dollars. He said that RTD
needed to be careful about taking a stand in the form of a resolution and
that staff should confer with the agency’s lobbyists to get their input too.

D. Other Matters
Director Folska, Ph.D., commented that she agreed with Director Hoy’s earlier
statements and added that RTD needed to keep staff focused on RTD issues. She
then asked if RTD was in the process of rebranding itself.

Director Menten thanked Mr. Gary Van Dorn for illustrating to her that the braille
signage at Civic Center Station was improperly labeled. She said that he took her
on a tour of the station and added that the National Federation of the Blind of
Colorado (NFBCO) was also hosting a Twitter series on braille signage
General Manager Genova stated that staff had two items that they would like to
provide to the Board. He noted that the US Department of Transportation had asked
RTD to travel to Washington, D.C., to provide a briefing on Positive Train Control
(PTC), which would outline RTD’s current position with the technology, barriers
RTD had encountered, and what implementation was left to be done. He noted that
he and key members of staff would be traveling to Washington, D.C., for the PTC
meeting on Wednesday, February 14th. He added that a lot of class one railroads
were grappling with multiple users on its lines, but that was not a problem RTD
was experiencing.
Mr. Stopplecamp introduced Andy Mutz, Engineering Project Manager, to provide a
Southwest Rail Extension (SERE) update.
Mr. Mutz commented that staff was planning a nine day shutdown of the SE Rail
from March 16th through March 26th in order to replace tracks and overhead
catenary wires. He noted that patrons will have to drive north to Dry Creek or
further to catch a train during that time. He explained that the March timeframe
was chosen because it would offer two weekends, and also because it was the
week of spring break for the Auraria Campus schools. He noted that this was a big
endeavor and staff had been working on this for over a year.
General Manager Genova added that CDOT would also be completing work during
the same timeframe, and the goal was to go get all of the work done during one
block of time instead of having multiple shutdowns.
Director Broom asked for clarification about an email relating to N Line disruptions.
Mr. Stopplecamp explained that the N Line would be tied into Denver Union
Station, which would require a shut down. He said that the challenge would be to
tie in the overhead power system with the existing wires, which was under the
purview of the FRA, and RTD must follow their oversight.

General Manager Genova explained that RTD had been changing some of its public
facing materials and staff was making updates to templates to fall in line with that
change. He noted that, in relation to the SW Chief, the state passed a law which
created a commissioner spot for RTD. He said that the SW Chief rail alignment
could connect or interface with RTD’s system and it was important for RTD to have
a seat at that table. He noted that the SW Chief update was brought forward
because that entity had asked for RTD’s input, and after the comments made this
evening, staff will have to determine if a resolution item will be brought to the
Board or not.

B. Recommended Actions

• Contract Option Award for the Purchase of 44 Cutaway Buses
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee,
to exercise the option of contract 25FK006 with Master’s Transportation for
the purchase of 44 Goshen cutaway buses to be used for the Access-a-Ride
and Call-n-Ride services at a price not to exceed $3,100,654.
Motion:

Director Folska made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the February 27, 2018
Board Meeting.
Director Archuleta seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, said
that Michael Ford, Chief Operating Officer, and Steve Gieske,
General Superintendent of Maintenance, were with him to
discuss the motion. He said that this action related to Task
Goal #3, State of Good Repair. He noted that this action
would replace 32 vehicles currently used in the Call-n-Ride
service that were seven years old. He added that this action
was an administrative detail that allowed staff a five-year
period to have a phased replacement of the fleet.
Director Archuleta inquired as to what brand the buses would
be.
Mr. Gieske stated that they were Goshen buses from Elkhart,
Indiana.

Director Broom asked what would happen to the buses that
were being phased out, and inquired if they would they be
traded in or sold.

Director Menten commented that the service lifespan for these
buses were five years, and the Federal Transit Administration
(FTA) minimum guidelines for these buses were five years.
She asked if this purchase was really the best buy for RTD’s
money.
Mr. Abel said yes, and added that staff felt that this was
appropriate and in line with the FTA’s guidelines. He said that
the FTA separates vehicles into three categories: light,
medium, and heavy duty. He remarked that these buses fall
into the light duty category, and RTD has been able to get a
seven-year lifespan from them.
Director Menten asked what the seating configuration would
be for the new buses.
Mr. Gieske commented that the Call-n-Ride vehicles have two
wheelchair positions and thirteen seats and the Access-a-Ride
vehicles have four companion seats and three wheelchair tie
down positions.

• Recommended Changes to Special Event Services
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that
the Board of Directors approve the following changes to Special Event
services:
1. Discontinue RockiesRide bus service and authorize staff to develop
alternative service configurations to serve Longmont and Wagon
Road/Thornton on Rockies games weekends; and
Packet Pg. 25

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 13, 2018 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Mr. Abel stated that RTD disposes of vehicles via auction. He
said that RTD has a contract with Roller Auctions and they
auction all of RTD’s retired vehicles electronically.

6.C

2. Discontinue RTD RACE service to the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure
event.
Motion:

Director Broom made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the February 27, 2018
Board Meeting.

Discussion:

Mr. Abel said that this action as brought forth in support of
RTD’s fiscal sustainability goals. He noted that, when Major
League Baseball (MLB) opened in Denver in 1993, RockiesRide
service was added for ridership to those games. He explained
that RockiesRide service had been reduced over the years, and
in 2017, there was only an average of 236 people each way.
He added that this year the Rockies had advised RTD that the
lot at Wazee and 22nd would be used for parking for their
games due to local development. He stated that the Race for
the Cure ridership had declined dramatically as well, and for
those reasons staff would like to discontinue those two
services. He remarked that RTD’s service standards require a
minimum attendance of 40,000 people to justify the usage of
buses for special services, and because the RockiesRide and
Race for the Cure have not met that attendance in years, staff
would like to discontinue those services. He noted that RTD
had alternative services available, such as routine service to
Denver Union Station (DUS) and on game days, and that RTD
would back those services up.
Director Lubow stated that she would vote no on this because
she wanted the issue to continue to be discussed. She added
that there were people in Longmont that felt that they were
not listened to about this and she felt that everyone could get
to the same place with more discussion.
Mr. Abel commented that there were two open houses at
RTD’s Blake Street office and constituents also shared their
comments with staff via phone and email.
Director Lubow explained that people in Longmont felt
aggrieved, and there was a sense that they were treated like a
stepchild. She said that it was important to deal with the
ridership in Longmont sensitively and she would like to see
more discussions happen in her district.
Packet Pg. 26

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 13, 2018 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Archuleta seconded the motion.

6.C

Chair Tisdale stated that it might be fair to say for the record
that this action was not a discontinuation, as it was more akin
to a right-sizing of service. He said that retooling to be more
effective in the light of changes in circumstances was
appropriate, so he would be voting to support this item.

Mr. Abel said yes and added that staff would be looking at
that as an alternative option. He said that the 120X runs from
the Wagon Road Park-n-Ride to DUS, and that was the
terminal that RTD would use henceforth for any special service
for events such as the Rockies games.
Director Hoy inquired if the 236 Longmont passengers who
used the RockiesRide had the same opportunity to participate
in the open house that RTD hosted.
Mr. Abel said yes, they participated via phone or email, but
there were no physical meetings held in Longmont.
Director Sisk commented that RTD needed to provide more
service to Longmont. He said that RTD was leaving them
stranded so he would vote no on the action until he could see
a plan that would service Longmont. He said that he wanted
staff to show him what they had planned, and what
alternatives were being considered as well.
Director Anderson remarked that staff would do a good job to
provide service and increase service in places that need it,
such as Longmont. She added, however, that RTD would not
be able to please everyone.
Director Menten said that she was in support of this item, and
no matter what part of the district this affected, it needed to
be done for the taxpayers.

• Service Availability Update 2 13 18
Mr. Abel said that lost service hours increased from 270.76 in January 2017
to 664.04 in January of 2018. He stated that at the conclusion of 2017,
staff provided 99.4% of all hours, but that required mandates or volunteers.
He added that staff continues to work with HR for recruitment and retention
to right size RTD’s service and balance the level of service with the amount
of operators available.
Chair Tisdale noted that on the cover memo, the increase from 271 lost
service hours to 664 is actually a 245% increase that was only identified as
“a slight increase”.

D. Other Matters
Director Anderson remarked that she wanted to take an opportunity to offer her
deepest condolences to the family of the bus driver who passed away earlier in the
week. She said that this had happened before and it would be her desire for RTD to
look to the health of its bus drivers and operators. She said that RTD should ensure
its employees are receiving good healthcare and good advice about some of the
things that cause sudden death. She added that RTD as a whole should become
healthier and there are some quick and easy ways to do that. She further stated
that RTD needed to help its employees lead a long and productive life.
Mr. Abel stated that he wanted to update the Board on the upcoming work for the
I-25/C470 interchange. He said that RTD staff would take advantage of that nineday period that the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) was using for
the C470 widening project to do some work on RTD’s system. He explained that
due to the magnitude of the shut down and the level of service necessary to
provide meaningful bus bridge service, RTD was currently not in a position to
provide bus bridge service. He stated that staff had secured additional parking at
the Arapahoe Station and were working on securing additional parking at the
Southmore and Dry Creek Park-n-Rides. He said that the General Manager would
meet with the Denver South Economic Development Partnership (EDP) to discuss
the impacts to that area.

Director Walker asked if there would be any lane closures on I-25 or C470.
Mr. Abel stated that there should be closures on C470 because of the interchange.
Director Walker commented that staff was taking the appropriate steps to provide
other options to people who might be impacted.

Director Folska asked what contingency support did staff have in place for those
who were transit dependent.
Mr. Abel said that staff has the potential use of Call-n-Ride vehicles, and staff has
reached out to Lyft for other options. He added that staff is currently engaged in a
variety of conversations as well.
Director Lubow asked if it was correct to say that RTD was stopping service
because it has to, but at the same time, it was not offering anything else to replace
it.
Mr. Abel stated that Light Rail would run as far south as the Dry Creek Station. He
commented that it was appropriate to say that service was being curtailed at Dry
Creek and that constituents would need to access service from other stations
during the nine day period.

B. Recommended Actions

• Authorization to enter into a contract with DatamanUSA
It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to
execute all documents necessary to award a contract to DatamanUSA for
ERP Work Order Contract (Contract Number 17DH023) for an amount not to
exceed $7,750,000 over 5 years. Work is administered on an as-needed,
work order basis. Funding for these Work Orders will be included in the
budgets of the projects on which the work is performed.
Motion:

Director Deadwyler made the motion to move
this item to the full Board at the February 27,
2018 Board Meeting.
Director Anderson seconded the motion.

Discussion: Ms. McKillop stated that RTD had worked for the last 11 years
with an outside vendor to assist with enterprise resource planning (ERP)
systems. She said the following five years would be unique because the
agency had approved a major upgrade of its ERP software, which included
Oracle and other applications. She said the DatamanUSA contract allowed
RTD to supplement its resources with outside staff. She stated that the
agency did not have sufficient work force or expertise in house and that it
was not cost effective to house those resources internally. She said that,
because the contract was non-project specific, staff had estimated the costs
on the high side. She noted the previous five-year contract allowed
expenditures up to $10 million, but the agency only spent $2.2 million of
that, and she anticipated the actual cost of the new contract to be less than
full the full cost.
Director Folska, Ph.D., said she was concerned with the language of the
recommended action that said that any work performed “will be in budget”.
She said it was not clear what may or may not be needed and stated that
Packet Pg. 31

6.D

6.D

she would prefer to approve actions on a contract-by-contract basis. She
indicated she would vote no.

Ms. McKillop said the recommended action authorized staff to enter into a
master contract, allowing them purchasing authority based on individual
orders. She said the work orders would be based on individual projects. She
stated that, for the Board to authorize purchases item by item, staff would
have to request Board approval on a monthly basis, which could delay
forward progress. She said that the master contract structure was common
for IT and capital programs projects, where staff was granted non-project
specific funding up to a certain amount.
Director Lubow asked whether a change to the recommended action would
necessarily mean that the work orders would have to be approved one at a
time or whether the upper limit of the spending authority in the contract
could instead be set at $4 or $5 million.
Ms. McKillop said she would not recommend changing the action but stated
that doing so was in the Board’s prerogative.
Director Solano said that, coming from IT data background, he saw the
contract as a rainy day fund and said that money should be accessible when
necessary. He said he would be a yes vote.
Director Anderson said she agreed with Director Solano. She said the agency
could be hacked and that even $7 million would not be enough to recover.
She said she would support the recommended action because she felt that
having a contract to cover incidents on nights and weekends, without
having to wait for Board approval, supported RTD’s customers.
Director Walker said he would support the motion, because the budget for a
given project would not be known ahead of time. He said he was familiar
with this type of purchasing structure because of his other work.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 13, 2018 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Lubow said she had the same concern as Director Folska, Ph.D. She
asked whether it would be feasible to reauthorize the contract after the first
$5 million in expenditures and questioned why staff was asking for such a
large sum.

Committee Chair Mihalik declared the motion PASSED.

The Finance Administration & Audit Committee recommends that the Board
of Directors approve the attached RTD Code of Ethics.
Motion:

Director Sisk made the motion to move this item
to the full Board at the February 27, 2018 Board
Meeting.
Director Deadwyler seconded the motion.

Discussion: Committee Chair Mihalik commented that the Board had
previously heard about the revised code in a recent update item and asked
whether there was anything new to report.
Rolf Asphaug, General Counsel, said that Karl Shoemaker, Raleigh Elstun,
and Corey Petzinger, members of the Leadership Academy team who
worked on the code revision, were in attendance, as was their advisor, Pam
Kachka. He said that the team had made the changes recommended during
the last meeting and that they invited any other changes. He noted that an
amendment, which included suggested changes that were not included in
the packet, had been printed and distributed to the Directors. He said the
amendment contained appropriate minor wording changes that would make
policy stronger. He concluded by recommending the Board approve the
recommended action in order to cover all employees, not just procurement
staff.
Motion to
amend:

Chair Tisdale made the motion to amend the
Code of Ethics.
Director Broom seconded the motion.

Director Broom asked how long the amendment was.

• Code of Ethics Approval

6.D

Mr. Asphaug said the amendment was short, and he offered to read the
changes into the record. He said that, if the committee agreed, the
amendment could also be approved by acclamation.

Director Menten, speaking to questions that had been raised the first time
the revised code was presented, asked whether the amended code still
contained provisions that would prevent a situation in which an RTD
employee could improperly participate in the selection of a contractor and
subsequently leave RTD to work for the selected contractor.
Mr. Asphaug said he felt the policy was worded properly to avoid such
situations and gave the agency and the Board the flexibility to deal with
those situations and to help avoid even the appearance of impropriety.
Director Menten asked about one of the changes in the amendment that
referenced “reasonable persons”.
Mr. Asphaug said that it was standard practice in codes such as RTD’s Code
of Ethics to have a “reasonable person” standard.
Director Menten asked whether the previous code was focused too
narrowly.
Mr. Asphaug responded that the previous code was written specifically for
procurement employees.
Director Lubow suggested that it would be a good idea to define certain
types of personal interests for the purpose of the code.
Mr. Asphaug said that the code distinguished between remote and direct
interests. He said the point of the distinction was to avoid a situation in
which a person who has a significant stake in the outcome of a procurement
could engage in self-dealing.
Director Anderson asked how RTD would handle a situation in which a
Board Member worked for an RTD supplier.
Mr. Asphaug said that, at a minimum, the Director would have to recuse
himself or herself from voting. He said there were other considerations as
well, such as situations in which a Director had interest in an entity that was
the only possible provider of a service required by RTD.

C. Updates

• General Manager Contract Review
Doug MacLeod, Controller, introduced Matt Marino and Cheryl Wallace,
auditors from RubinBrown. He said that the Board required an external
auditor to review the General Manager’s contract and benefits.
Mr. Marino stated that RubinBrown had performed the audit for the last
several years. He stated that the General Manager was in his second full
year of a five-year contract and that 2018 marked his third year. He noted
that, in reviewing the General Manager’s contract, RubinBrown looked at
changes in tax law and reviewed the General Manager’s discretionary
performance payout, which was less in 2017 than the maximum amount
allowed.
Director Menten asked if the Directors would receive a hard copy of the
report and whether the document would be posted online.
Ms. McKillop said that hard copies would be distributed and an electronic
copy would be posted on the RTD website, in the location where audits
were typically posted.
Chair Tisdale equated the audit to a fairness opinion of an investment banker
in that it reviewed the circumstances in the marketplace and determined
whether the General Manager’s contract remained fair according to its
terms.

• 2017 Financial Audit

Ms. Wallace said that RubinBrown had completed its auditing functions and
had reviewed several processes in place at RTD, including the processing
and transmission of payroll, federal compliance, and other key controls. She
said her firm would continue to perform testing on year-end balances.
Mr. Marino said that his firm was also required to communicate with the
Board as part of the Board’s governance function. He asked whether the
Directors had any further questions.
Director Broom asked how the auditors performed payroll audits.
Mr. Marino said that his firm looked at the system to process payroll to
determine whether the controls were effective. He said they implemented
testing, reviewed sample selections, and performed an analytical review to
ensure that changes, such as cost-of-living adjustments, were being made
appropriately.
Director Broom asked whether the firm checked payroll processing against
the union contract.
Mr. Marino responded that RubinBrown checked to see that payroll
processing was consistent with the contract.
Director Menten asked how the Directors should contact RubinBrown if they
had additional questions.
Mr. Marino said that Directors could contact either Ms. Wallace or him.
Ms. McKillop said that staff could include their contact information in the
Friday report from the General Manager. She said that it was preferable for
Directors to speak with the auditors directly in order to maintain their
independence.

• December 2017 Monthly Financial Status Report
Mr. MacLeod reviewed the December Monthly Financial Statement. He said
that the dashboard numbers were solid but noted that the documented
expenses could change once all invoices were accrued. He said the key
Packet Pg. 36

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 13, 2018 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Mr. Marino said RubinBrown also audits RTD’s finances each year. He said
that, once the audit is completed, staff then presents the audited figures as
the agency’s comprehensive annual financial statement (CAFR). He stated
his firm also performed an audit for the purposes of the agency’s reporting
on grants and expenditures required by the Federal Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) Circular A-133.

performance indicators were consistent, though he noted that the sales and
use tax revenues were lower than expected for the month due to an
adjustment in tax filings by a large utility located in Denver. He said the
utility filed the tax returns in Denver rather than in the jurisdiction from
which the taxes were collected. He stated the issue was still being
addressed by the Department of Revenue (DOR). He said it was unlikely for
the corrected tax filings to affect RTD until fiscal year 2018. He noted that
staff had originally assumed a 6.7% year-over-year tax revenue increase but
later revised that figure to 4.0%. He said that the second half of 2017 had
brought in better than expected tax revenues, however, and stated that
actual revenues grew 6.1%, which figure also took into account the loss of
marijuana tax revenues in the second half of 2017. He stated that, in total,
the agency received $12 million more than anticipated on a budget of $586
million. He said ridership was 6.6% under budget projections and nearly 2%
below 2016 levels, though fare revenue was only down 1% due to a shift in
ridership from bus routes to the University of Colorado A Line.
Mr. MacLeod added that staff had included in the packet a graphic depicting
RTD’s ridership figures in comparison to other transit agencies. He said that,
according to the figures compiled by the American Public Transportation
Association (APTA), through September 2017 RTD was down 6.9%, as
compared to a decline of 5% for the entire industry. He said light rail
ridership was up 5%, and commuter rail was up 15.5%, as compared to an
overall rail ridership decline of 0.2% in the industry. He said special services
ridership was up 1.4% vs. 0.3% industry wide. In summary, he said that
overall RTD ridership was down 1.5%, compared to an industry-wide decline
of 3.6% overall. He said the graphic also compared RTD to agencies of
similar size and noted that only a few agencies had experienced flat or
increasing ridership, whereas many other agencies were down compared to
2016.
Director Broom asked whether the utility mentioned in the Monthly Financial
Statement was a natural gas or electric utility. If so, he said the utility would
be a substantial contributor to the tax base.
Mr. MacLeod said that was correct and that the impact to RTD as a result of
the misfiled returns was $5.3 million. He said he was unsure how much of
that amount would be returned to RTD.
Director Broom asked when the filings would be corrected.
Mr. MacLeod responded that staff originally thought the filings would be
completed by December 2017 but said they now hoped the filings would
done by the end of January 2018.

Director Broom stated the taxes collected by the utility were likely within the
RTD District.

Director Lubow thanked staff for providing the ridership comparison. She
said she had read an article about a transit agency in Seattle, which was one
of the few agencies that had experienced ridership growth in 2017. She said
that agency had worked with city and state employers on a commute trip
reduction program aimed at getting employees out of the one-person-vehicle
mode. She said that the program was yielding great results according to
graph and stated that, despite the national trend of declining ridership, in
individual situations work was being done to buck that trend.
Director Walker said there were several reasons for a decline in ridership
among the different agencies, such as weather, aging infrastructure, and
transportation network companies (TNCs). He noted that the graphic
showed King County Metro Transit (KCMT), as opposed to Sound Transit.
He noted that KCMT was authorized to make improvements that RTD could
not, such as improvements to roads. He added that the graphic did not
explain everything in regards to declines in ridership. He asked whether the
ridership numbers from the graphic took into account new lane miles such as
RTD’s opening of the R Line in 2017.
Mr. MacLeod said the addition of the R Line explained the increase in light
rail ridership.
Director Sisk said he enjoyed graphs and numbers but would not rely too
heavily on them. He noted the example of KCMT and said that the City of
Seattle and the Washington state legislature were not happy with the
agency. He agreed that the agency had done an incredible job but
questioned what the agency had done to get to achieve their successes. He
added that he did not like seeing red numbers in the financial reports and
that it made sense for RTD to look at what other agencies were doing right.
General Manager Genova said that ridership was a national conversation and
that lots of research and analysis was being conducted on the subject. He
noted that he had seen research that indicated that increasing household
vehicle ownership exponentially reduces transit trips. He said the study
showed that annual transit trips were reduced from 229 to 38 when
transitioning from a zero–car to a one-car household and from 38 trips to 10
when adding a second vehicle.

Ms. McKillop said that staff had made the same assumption but noted that
DOR could not quantify that yet.

• Quarterly Investment Report
Brendan Morgan, Senior Manager of Debt and Investments, presented the
investment report from the fourth quarter of 2017. He noted that, as
interest rates go up, bonds go down, which was reflected in RTD’s financial
statements. He said the agency’s investments were in line with benchmarks
and stated the total investment income return for 2017 was over $4.1
million, an overall portfolio increase of 1.5%.

Director Broom asked what happens to the proceeds from individual portfolio
earnings go and asked whether the proceeds are returned to the general
fund or to capital projects.
Mr. Morgan said it depended on the project. He said that unencumbered
funds often remained after the completion of projects and that the fine print
determined what could be done with the money left over. He said that the
best option typically available to the agency was to use the leftover funds to
pay upcoming principle and interest payments, which would then free up
general fund dollars that would have otherwise gone to those payments.
Director Anderson noted that annual budgets are a scientific wild guess. She
offered congratulations to staff for establishing estimates that fell within 1%
of the actual annual sales tax revenues.

Other Matters
Chair Tisdale spoke about the Colorado Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) hearing
that took place that day in the same building. He said that the CPUC had authorized
Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) Garvey to proceed with a hearing, and he noted
that the ALJ’s reporting was an investigatory function. He stated that the ALJ’s
role was to compile information and ask questions posed by the Commissioners,
after which he would report back to the CPUC regarding his findings so that they
could then issue a final action regarding their previous decision to deny the waiver
of the requirement to post crossing guards along the commuter rail lines. He noted
that the hearing was unopposed, meaning that no other parties had presented

6.E

evidence or arguments in opposition to RTD’s position. He said that three of RTD’s
four expert witnesses had already testified and that the fourth was about to take
the stand. He said the process was going well. He commented that General
Manager Genova had done a fantastic job of presenting testimony. He said it was
likely that the hearing would not carry over to the following day.

Chair Tisdale said the judge would make his own proposed findings, which would
be formally adopted by the CPUC. He said he had encountered similar
circumstances on the State Board of Registered Psychotherapists, where the State
Board would refer matters to the ALJ, who then made findings and conclusions
upon which the State Board had the right to appeal and decide upon that appeal.
Ms. McKillop asked whether the Commissioners were in attendance.
Chair Tisdale said that Commissioner Koncilja was there and spoke briefly but
stated he had not seen the other two.
Director Deadwyler proposed that the Board present certificates of appreciation to
Finn and Sully McKay for being the inaugural participants to lead the Pledge of
Allegiance at the January 30, 2018, Board Meeting. She said she would like to
personally give them restaurant gift certificates as tokens of her appreciation.
Director Menten said that taxpayer money should not be used.
Director Deadwyler confirmed that she intended to purchase the gift certificates
personally.
Chair Tisdale said that the Board Members might choose to volunteer to provide
such tokens of appreciation for future participants.
Director Deadwyler said that the entire group could be given a gift certificate if the
Board chose to do so.
Director Lubow said she was concerned about providing a monetary reward for
participants because groups might feel they did something wrong if they did not
receive something.
Chair Tisdale said that the gifts would be private, not sanctioned by the Board, and
that the gifts could be separately delivered to the recipients.

Director Lubow asked whether the judge would make his own findings.

Director Folska, Ph.D., said that she would not want to make the gifts publicly
known and agreed with Director Lubow that the Board would be setting an
expectation. She agreed that it would be nice to provide a certificate of
appreciation to participants.

Director Deadwyler asked if the certificate could include the signatures of the
members of the Executive Committee.
Chair Tisdale agreed and said the certificates should also include a statement of
appreciation of participation from the Board. He noted for the record that Director
Walker joined the meeting.
Director Menten said that the Board began to discuss the GM Oversight process
during the February 3, 2018, Board-only retreat but had run out of time. She asked
Director Walker if he had any update regarding the potential for amending the
General Manager’s core goals.
Director Walker stated that the core goals were part of the General Manager’s job
description.
Ms. McManus noted that the General Manager’s goals for 2018 had already been
approved and that any changes would apply in 2019.
Director Walker said that the GM Oversight Committee could discuss parts of the
job description.
Director Menten said that, as Chair of the GM Oversight Committee, Director
Walker would want to discuss changes to the core goals at the March 3, 2018,
joint Board/Senior Leadership Team (SLT) retreat.
Director Walker agreed that was the appropriate time to talk about the General
Manager’s core goals for 2019.
Ms. McKillop stated that the Board should be aware that changing the core goals
would rewrite the General Manager’s job description.

Chair Tisdale suggested that Ms. McManus could provide a sample certificate and,
with the committee’s consent, he would approve the final form.

6.E

Director Walker said that the committee could just reshuffle the goals or they could
make changes that were more substantial.
Ms. McKillop said that she could provide the list of core goals used for other staff
evaluations.

Director Deadwyler responded that discussion was about revising the goals.
Chair Tisdale asked whether the core goals were articulated in the current contract
or whether the contract stated that the Board was responsible for setting the core
goals for the General Manager.
Director Walker said that the contract stated the General Manager’s performance
evaluation was based on his core goals.
Director Deadwyler asked who set the goals.
Director Lubow responded that the Board set the goals in the form of the General
Manager’s contract.
Ms. McManus added that the evaluation also included the task goals that came out
of the Board retreat. She said the core goals had not changed
Chair Tisdale asked what Director Menten was contemplating in revising the goals.
Director Menten said that she wanted to refresh the goals to account for the
current situation at RTD and to analyze whether the goals were set too low or too
high. She said that the General Manager’s contract stated that changes could be
made for the following year’s goals if presented with proper notice in October.
Chair Tisdale asked whether it was fair to summarize Director Menten’s intent as
being to discuss at the upcoming retreat whether the core goals should be modified
or expanded for 2019, which would then give the Board ample opportunity to draft
revisions and provide notice before the October deadline.

Packet Pg. 45

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 15, 2018 12:00 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Lubow asked whether a change to the core goals would change the
General Manager’s contract.

6.E

Chair Tisdale, again to summarize, said that what he was hearing was that the
question was not about proposing an amendment to contract, but rather that the
contract allowed Board to annually review the General Manager’s, goals, strategies,
and tactics. He said the Board had typically set three core goals for the General
Manager. He stated he had heard from Directors initially that they would consider
increasing the number of core goals and decide whether the goals should be better
articulated.
Director Menten said she would not limit the discussion to an increase in core goals
and said that the committee may decide to have more or fewer.
Ms. McManus stated that she had sent Director Menten two documents, the initial
document previously used in the recruitment for the General Manager Position,
which flowed into General Manager Genova’s initial contract, and another
document that served as the original job description for the General Manager. She
reiterated that the Board would need to look at changes sooner rather than later,
because any substantial changes could prompt either General Manager Genova or
the Board to make changes to the contract.
Chair Tisdale asked whether there could be some initial discussion in March.
Director Walker said that was what he was hearing.
Chair Tisdale said that such a discussion would be congruent with the general
mission of the retreat.
Ms. McManus said yes and that both General Manager Genova and his
predecessor, Phil Washington, felt that the General Manager should be evaluated in
the same manner as the rest of the RTD employees. She stated that she would
send out the list of core goals applicable to other employees.
Director Deadwyler stated other staff members’ goals were being achieved through
goals written for the General Manager.
Chair Tisdale said that General Manager’s contract did say that he should be
reviewed in same manner as other employees.

Packet Pg. 46

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 15, 2018 12:00 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Menten agreed but said that she had not heard it stated specifically by
others that the core goals could be changed. She said she did not see a problem in
changing the core goals, especially if the Board gave sufficient notice.

6.E

Director Walker noted the Board was fairly constrained in what it could do but said
he welcomed the conversation.
Director Deadwyler said that, if the original core goals written for former General
Manager Noel Busck were still in use, those goals should be revisited.

Director Walker said that the Board changed the General Manager’s task goals, not
the core goals, but added that nothing was written in stone.
Chair Tisdale said that the core goals should be re-examined each time the
committee convenes. He said the committee could decide to get rid of the core
goals entirely but noted that would be unlikely. He added that the committee could
either increase or reduce the number of core goals
Director Menten said that, in her previous experience on the GM Oversight
committee, the Directors had said that the core goals were set and nothing could
be done to change them. She said she disagreed with that notion.
Director Walker said his recollection was that the committee could not change the
core goals previously because of the timing of the changes.
Chair Tisdale added that the task of the GM Oversight Committee was to evaluate
the General Manager’s performance for 2018, whereas the General Manager’s
goals for 2019 would be set during the upcoming retreat.
Director Menten said that former Director Bagley had said previously that the
General Manager, whether Mr. Washington or Mr. Genova, and the Board had
agreed to a contract, and he felt that the Board could not change the terms of
employment in middle of a contract.
Ms. McManus noted that the General Manager was in an option year on his
contract.
Chair Tisdale said the question was whether the Board should exercise the General
Manager’s option, renegotiate the contract, or part company.
Ms. McKillop noted the difference between core and task goals was that core were
intended to be inherent skills or attributes required for someone to have at a given

Packet Pg. 47

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 15, 2018 12:00 PM (Committee Reports)

Ms. McManus said the core goals had not changed, which was why the evaluation
criteria were consistent for some time.

6.E

Director Walker said that neither the Board nor the General Manager could change
the contract unilaterally and that, while there was not a lot of wiggle room to
change core goals, there was no option for the Board to mandate a change to the
contract. He said that the Board could renegotiate the contract with General
Manager Genova if he agreed to do so.
Director Deadwyler asked the length of the contract.
Ms. McManus said the contract was for three years, plus two one-year options.
Director Folska, Ph.D., asked Director Menten what she was considering in terms of
adding or deleting core goals.
Director Menten said that one example would be the core goal criterion of providing
service. She said that, in order to exceed expectations, the General Manager
needed to meet only one target, which she said was a weak objective.
Ms. McManus clarified that, in that example, Director Menten was not proposing a
change in the core goals but rather the evaluative elements underneath them.
Director Menten agreed that might be the case. She said that she was looking at
what the word “exceeded” meant and had argued that the criterion related to
“being called to speak at a conference” was not in and of itself indicative of the
General Manager exceeding expectations for his leadership. She said that the
General Manager meeting individually with Directors would show his leadership.
Chair Tisdale summarized that the issue was more a reassessment of the General
Manager’s evaluative criteria. He said that the committee retooled the evaluation
format recently and that Director Menten was suggesting the focus of the
evaluation, rather than the core goals themselves, could be revisited.
Director Menten agreed and said the titles of the evaluation criteria may need to be
refreshed. She said that it had been nearly 15 years since the FasTracks initiative
appeared on the ballot.

Packet Pg. 48

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 15, 2018 12:00 PM (Committee Reports)

level of position, whereas task goals were individual job objectives set for each
year. She said it was in the Board’s prerogative to change the goals and the agency
would then reevaluate how those goals are interpreted. She added that the core
goals were metrics to use when interviewing candidates.

6.E

Chair Tisdale stated that such matters could be brought up during the March retreat
and said ensuring that the goals are measurable would be part of the conversation
moving forward.

Director Walker said that he did not share the same concern, because he stated
that most of the measuring elements were fairly objective.
Chair Tisdale said that some of the criteria had changed since Director Deadwyler
served on the GM Oversight Committee.
Director Walker agreed and said that the Directors would review the core goals and
develop task goals at the March retreat, after which the General Manager would
flesh out those goals and present them to the Board for approval.
Director Deadwyler again asked how the goals would be measured.
Director Lubow said that too would be discussed.
Chair Tisdale said that discussion would be part of the process.
Director Walker said the General Manager would determine how he and staff would
meet the goals and that the Board would decide how the goals were measured.
Director Menten agreed and gave the 2017 Women’s March as an example of an
empirical measure, since a certain number of attendees were expected and many
more attended. She asked Ms. McKillop to provide an explanation of how the core
goals flowed down into the evaluation criteria and stated that she did not want to
make the goals unattainable.
Ms. McManus said that the evaluative elements were simply plugged in. She said
that making changes to the elements would be easy unless there were numerous
changes.
Chair Tisdale said the framework was flexible enough to allow tweaks.

Packet Pg. 49

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 15, 2018 12:00 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Deadwyler said she appreciated Chair Tisdale’s comments. She stated she
was on the GM Oversight Committee years ago and that the committee could not
come to a conclusion on how to measure accomplishments, which was unfair to
the General Manager.

6.E

Ms. McManus said that one additional change from the previous year was that the
evaluation survey would now reflect all of the specific evaluative elements.
Director Deadwyler said she discussed with former Director Francone how the
responses to the survey were weighted.

Director Menten said she did not realize that the survey questions were not equally
weighted.
Ms. McManus said the weighing was a function of the survey’s format. She said
that, in reviewing the survey as a whole, there were specific comments that could
not be incorporated into the overall evaluation.
Director Deadwyler suggested that was the reason some Directors did not complete
their surveys.
Ms. McManus said that the survey could be easily contoured.
Chair Tisdale said he understood Director Walker’s intention to make the General
Manager’s performance evaluation a collaborative process. He said he felt good
about that and that each of the Directors would support him in that effort. He
noted for the record that General Manager Genova had arrived in the room.
General Manager Genova said he did not have specific comments about the CPUC
hearing to report and that he expected the hearing would conclude that day.
Chair Tisdale stated that former Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) official
Clifford Eby had given good testimony describing the FRA process, the impact of
waivers and what they represent, and how FRA deals with waivers.
Director Deadwyler asked when an answer would be rendered.
General Manager Genova said that the ALJ would draft his opinion within weeks
and would then present his findings to the Commissioners. He said the written
order would take about a month.
Director Lubow asked whether the ALJ’s findings would be made public.

Packet Pg. 50

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 15, 2018 12:00 PM (Committee Reports)

Ms. McManus said the changes to the survey would mean that each of the
individual responses would carry a lot of weight.

6.E

General Manager Genova said that the findings would eventually be presented in a
written order and that the ALJ’s preliminary findings would become a public
document.

General Manager Genova stated that the testimony was incredibly complex. He said
that the previous witness had cleared up many of the questions about the design of
the system.
Chair Tisdale said that the ALJ would meet with the Commissioners that day during
a break in the hearing. He said there would be no closing arguments presented that
day and that comments would be submitted later.
Director Lubow asked if the Directors could review the written closing statement.
General Manager Genova said yes and commented that no one in the audience was
there in opposition. He said the proceeding was unusual in that the ALJ was only
one asking questions.
Director Walker noted that he sent a draft schedule of the GM Oversight Committee
calendar to Ms. McManus.
Ms. McManus said that she and Director Walker had spoken about the schedule
earlier but noted that the timeframe would change as a result of the earlier
conversation.
Director Walker said he would have something to report during the February 27th,
2018, Board Meeting.
Director Folska, Ph.D. said that she wanted the committee to be cognizant that the
agency may have to cut service and raise fares.
Chair Tisdale said that those were poignant issues. He said that Mike Meader, Chief
Safety Officer and Assistant General Manager of Safety, Security, and Asset
Management, had given a sobering presentation that alerted us to the issues
Director Folska addressed. He said the agency would have to look long and hard at
what would happen to service as Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA)
negotiations conclude.

Packet Pg. 51

Chair Tisdale said RTD’s General Counsel would likely file comments on the ALJ’s
findings.

6.E

Director Menten agreed and said that the key word in her public meetings would be
“efficiencies”. She said that in a given meeting with 60 constituents only a few
typically used RTD’s services. She said those people did not like to hear about fare
subsidies.
Director Deadwyler said that her constituents appreciated honesty and stated that,
if the agency were in trouble, people would want to hear the truth. She said she
was asked at one of her public meetings why others at RTD were not as forthright.
Chair Tisdale said he continued to work on a resolution with Director Lubow
regarding FasTracks and that their focus was on the paragraph that explained what
had happened.
Director Lubow said she felt strongly that it would not be a good time to raise fares
if the agency decided to cut service.
Chair Tisdale noted that such matters were not on the day’s agenda and that there
would be other opportunities to address them.

Director Folska, Ph.D., said that, when considering what to do with fares, the
agency should be cautious of combining service reductions with fare increases. She
suggested that selling both service reductions and fare increases simultaneously
would not sit well with constituents.

Retiree Awards
Chair Tisdale noted there were five (5) retirees for the month of January with two (2) in

Mr. Abel stated that unfortunately, Edward Jenkins was not in attendance yet.
Chair Tisdale asked Terry Emmons, Assistant General Manager of Rail Operations to
introduce Mr. Greg Pennington.
Mr. Emmons stated the he was honored to acknowledge Mr. Pennington’s retirement and

for RTD. Mr. Emmons stated that Mr. Pennington began working for RTD in 1985 as a
General Repair Bus Mechanic, and worked his way through different divisions within RTD.
Mr. Emmons said that in 1990 Mr. Pennington began supervising at the Platte Division and
was promoted to a permanent positon as Running Repair Supervisor. He added that in

that department as General Superintendent of Infrastructure. Mr. Emmons acknowledged
that Mr. Pennington had been married to his wife, Shelly, for 37 years, and thanked her
for her support for all the years that Mr. Pennington had been with RTD. He added that
Mr. Pennington and his wife intended to spend their retirement traveling, doing hobbies,
and spending time with their family and grandchildren. Mr. Emmons thanked Mr.
Pennington for his hard work stating that he was more than just a co-worker but a great
friend.
Mr. Pennington thanked Mr. Emmons, RTD, and all of the people he had worked with for
all the opportunities that had been afforded to him over the years. He specifically thanked
Mr. Emmons for the years of friendship and support.

V.

Public Participation
Chair Tisdale stated that the public participation period was open to anyone who wanted
to speak. He explained that elected officials were invited to speak first, and others would
be called in the order they signed up, and then additional speakers would be invited at the
end of the list. He reminded the audience that each speaker was allowed three minutes
and to approach the lectern when called and state their name and address. Chair Tisdale
asked that if any speaker had documentation or reference materials for the Board to give
those materials to the Board staff prior to speaking.
Doug Gragg, Denver, stated that he lived in the heart of Cheeseman Park and commented
on the issue with the City and County of Denver (CCD) and their desire for granite to be
used on the 16th Street Mall. He remarked that RTD should take a harder approach with
CCD and fight against using granite.
Joe Triplett, Aurora, thanked RTD and the Board for the support and flowers he had
received when his wife passed away. He added that it was an honor to receive the flowers
from RTD and that it meant a lot to him and his family.

General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Update
Chair Tisdale asked Director Francone, as the immediate past chair of the GM Oversight
and Performance Management Committee, if she would like to say a few words since
tonight was her last meeting.
Director Francone stated that the GM Oversight and Performance Management Committee
was the single most important committee that the Board served on. She added that all
Board members should be offering their opinions and completing the survey. Director
Francone stated she had passed the torch to Director Walker and thanked the staff and
Directors for all of their hard work and support.
Chair Tisdale stated that she would be missed.
Committee Chair Walker stated that he had reached out to Committee member and Board
Members and had received multiple comments:
1. Some Directors felt there was not adequate opportunity to provide input and some
stated that there was ample opportunity.
2. Most Directors stated there needed to be separation between the evaluation of the
General Manager’s performance and consideration of any discretionary performance
payment.
3. It was important to get the survey feedback from all Directors

pertinent events on the horizon, as well as other items the Board members should be made
aware.

4. There was a need to adjust meeting times in order to have the attendance of all
Committee members.
5. The committee needed attention and participation from the full Board and was an
open and transparent project.

Chair Tisdale stated that the American Public Transportation Association (APTA) legislative
conference would be held in Washington, D.C., from March 17th - 20th, 2018 and that
there were five (5) directors attending. He added that the South West Transit
Association’s (SWTA) “Freedom Through Transit” annual conference would be held in
Denver from March 5th - 7th, 2018 and three (3) directors had indicated interest in
attending. Chair Tisdale recommended that any Directors that had not responded speak
with the Board Office for more details on the event.

General Manager's Report
General Manager Genova stated that retiree Mr. Edward Jenkins had arrived and asked Mr.
Abel to introduce him to the board.
Mr. Abel asked Gina Callahan, Deputy Assistant General Manager of Bus Operation, to join
him to acknowledge Mr. Jenkins. He stated that Mr. Jenkins was retiring after eighteen
(18) years as a Bus Operator. Mr. Abel stated that Mr. Jenkins loved working, and that he
was looking forward to coming back to RTD part time as a retired bus operator.
Mr. Jenkins thank Mr. Abel and stated it had been a pleasure working with everyone.
General Manager Genova stated that his full report was in the packet, but he would share
a number of items that he wanted to update the Board on. He explained that on January
22, 2018 RTD submitted written testimony to the Colorado Public Utilities Commission
(CPUC) to support RTD’s requests to amend its applications relating to grade crossings for
the EAGLE Project’s University of Colorado A Line and G Line. RTD is seeking CPUC
approval to eliminate the requirement, as previously ordered by the Commission, for gradecrossing attendants to be present at grade crossings. General Manager Genova stated that
if there were no opposition wishing to file answer testimony, then the evidentiary hearing
would be held on February 15th - 16th, 2018. He added that if there was answer testimony
filed, then the hearing would be held March 12th - 14th, 2018. Mr. Genova stated that the
RTD project team and the Denver transit Partners (DTP) team had a number of technical
conferences with the interested parties and had heard that the testimony that RTD filed
had answered all of their questions.
General Manager Genova stated that testing on the G Line was proceeding and that the
current phase of the testing process would focus on communication and signaling
systems, as well as the communication of traffic and rail signals at railroad crossings. He
added that a fact sheet had been developed that would update the latest regarding the G
Line testing. He paraphrased some of the testing outcomes, asking people to be patient as
the process was being worked on and to expect some variability. He explained that testing
on the wireless crossing had not begun because there were other parameters to work
through prior to receiving regulatory approval and then testing on the wireless crossing

would begin. General Manager Genova stated that G Line testing, safety, train horn and
quiet zone information continued to be communicated to the communities along the G
Line.
General Manager Genova updated the quiet zone status explaining that the Federal
Railroad Administration (FRA) had given long-term waivers and that recently the FRA quiet
zone team had been in Denver to evaluate all of the grade crossings to determine that
federal requirements were being met. He added that an update was being developed that
would explain the current quiet zone status and the steps being worked through with the
FRA. General Manager Genova stated that the next steps would be to get through the
CPUC hearing and receive their acceptance to the FRA agreements.
General Manager Genova provided an update on the union negotiations stating that RTD
and the union continue to meet and have reached a tentative agreement on many of the
non-economic conditions such as the technology on the buses, restroom issues, and the
language in the contract. He explained that the next series of meetings would begin
discussions on economic issues and wages. General Manager Genova stated that RTD was
optimistic that the wage and benefit package was a solid offer and would be presented to
the union next week. He stated that he had sent the Board an email explaining that part of
the process was that the union filed a notice of intent to strike, which occurs every
negotiation, but it did not mean there would actually be a strike.
General Manager Genova provided a contractual update on the negotiations with DTP
regarding their change in law claim. He stated that negotiations were moving to the next
step in the contract, which was panel arbitration. General Manager Genova explained that
panel members would be selected to go through a non-binding arbitration process,
meaning either party could agree or disagree with the final decision, and then the
negotiation would move to the next step in the contract. He added that the schedule for
the panel arbitration was still being developed.
General Manager Genova provided a contractual update on the North Metro negotiations
with Regional Rail Partners (RRP) regarding the delay claim on the N Line project. He
explained that an agreement could not be reached with a negotiation mediator and that the
next step would be to move into binding arbitration. General Manager Genova explained
that binding arbitration included a comprehensive discovery process that would take a long
time. He added that he would continue to provide updates as information was made
available.
General Manager Genova stated he recently received information from RTD’s state liaison
that Senate Bill 88, which clarified the sales tax issue on retail marijuana had passed. He
added that at the next Government Relations Committee meeting, a more detailed report
would be provided from Brandeberry McKenna.

General Manager Genova introduced RTD’s new Chief Operating Officer Michael Ford. He
stated that the hiring process had been a national recruitment that had taken some time
with multiple postings to find the right candidate. General Manager Genova stated that
RTD was excited to have Mr. Ford on board and looking forward to what he would bring
to the agency.
Mr. Ford thanked the Board for the opportunity and for welcoming him to RTD.
Director Menten asked if the University of Colorado A Line had complied with the
conditions described in the FRA waiver. She asked if the University of Colorado A Line had
not met those conditions would there be an additional waiver. She remarked that a
constituent had asked the question and she needed additional background information.
General Manager Genova stated that a response was being prepared and would be issued
to the constituent directly. He explained that if the FRA required a waiver for constant
warning time it would be just to address the constant warning time. He stated that the
constant warning time may be added to the existing waiver or issued as a new waiver,
further adding that it was not uncommon for a waiver to be modified as issues were
addressed.
Director Menten stated that the University of Colorado A Line still had waiver conditions to
meet.
General Manager Genova stated that the constant warning time system was still being
worked on. He explained that in a recent letter to the stakeholders the agency stated that
the equipment was capable of providing the constant warning time with the wireless
crossing technology that works in conjunction with the positive train control. General
Manager Genova stated that the agency was committed to getting through the quiet zone
process and that there was language in the quiet zone rules that stated constant warning
time only needed to be provided if it was practical. He added that the information was
included in the letter and that it would be sent to the Board with other updates.
Director Lubow asked about the liability for the pension and retirement trust with regard to
the union contract negotiations.
General Manager Genova explained that the RTD Pension Trust had met to determine the
best model and plan, and would provide that decision at the next meeting with the union
contract representatives.

Subject:

Contract Amendment; 1st year (2018) option
2017-2019 Street Improvements & Shelter
Installations Contract # 37DM002

General

Board Meeting Date: February 27, 2018

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to award a
Contract Amendment to initiate the first option year (2018) of a three-year contract for the annual Street
Improvements & Shelter Installation contract with Manion Construction, Inc. for $371,409.75. Funding
for this Contract Amendment is provided by the annual 2018 Capital Programs Expense Budgets.
BACKGROUND
Section 810.2 of the United States Department of Transportation Standards specifies requirements for
new, altered, or relocated bus stops to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The
Street Improvements program serves the various needs of RTD and its patrons by providing improved
access to bus stops by installing boarding areas, and connecting walkways meeting ADA standards. Bus
pads, miscellaneous street and various emergency park-n-Ride repairs are also performed under this
contract.
Due to the repetitive nature of this work, a three-year contract was determined to be an effective way to
manage this work for the District. Bids were received through a publicly advertised contract, which was
awarded to Manion Construction, Inc. as the lowest responsive and responsible bidder in April of 2017.
Manion has had the Street Improvements contract since 2010 and has proven to be a very good
contractor. The current base contract value and proposed amendment are as follows:
Amount
Amendments
Total
Base year, 2017
$ 339,872.50
$ 150,000.00
$ 489,872.50
First option year (2018))
$ 371,409.75
0.00
$ 371,409.75
Grand Total: Base Year, Amendments, and first option year (2018) =
$ 861,282.25
DISCUSSION
This second amendment (1st year option) will increase the contract by $ 371,409.75, creating a total
contract amount, including this amendment, of $ 861,282.25.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The $371,409.75 funding for this Board Action shall come from the 2018 Capital Programs Expense
Budgets that are within the approved budget.
DBE GOAL
The contract requires 15% SBE participation - Manion Construction Inc. is a SBE certified contractor
thereby meeting this goal.

ALTERNATIVES
Accept the Recommended Action.
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to award a
Contract Amendment to initiate the first option year (2018) of a three-year contract for the annual Street
Improvements & Shelter Installation contract with Manion Construction, Inc. for $371,409.75. Funding
for this Contract Amendment is provided by the annual 2018 Capital Programs Expense Budgets.
Do Not Accept the Recommended Action.
Do not authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to award a
Contract Amendment to initiate the first option year (2018) year of a three-year option contract for the
annual Street Improvements & Shelter Installation contract with Manion Construction, Inc. Instead
develop a new Invitation for Bid (IFB) for this year’s construction work. This is not recommended
because:
a. It would take away RTD’s ability to move, alter, or relocate bus stops.
b. It would create a delay in constructing the planned 2018 street improvements
b. The current Contractor is providing a good quality product in a reasonable time.
c. The 2018 contract prices are considered to be fair and reasonable.
d. The District desires to partner with the DBE/SBE Community and Manion Construction is a
SBE certified contractor.

Subject:

Contract Option Award for the Purchase of 44
Cutaway Buses

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee, to exercise the option of contract 25FK006 with
Master’s Transportation for the purchase of 44 Goshen cutaway buses to be used for the Access-a-Ride
and Call-n-Ride services at a price not to exceed $3,100,654.
BACKGROUND
In support of the Board adopted 2018 Task Goal #3, Asset Management and State of Good Repair, Bus
Operations has begun the process of replacing the aging and high maintenance Cutaway Buses,
currently being used for the Access-a-Ride and Call-n-Ride services.
On January 19, 2016 the RTD Board of Director approved the procurement of 233 Goshen cutaway
buses. The procurement was the result of RTD Information for Bids (IFB25FK006) issued on October 19,
2015. Five bids were received on December 8, 2015 in response to this IFB. Master’s Transportation
was the responsive and responsible low bidder for the selected bus configurations. The IFB allowed RTD
to purchase additional cutaway buses for a five-year period with each successive year pricing to be
based on the initial base pricing plus an inflationary price adjustment set by the US Department of
Labor’s Producer Price Index (PPI). The application of this formula to the original price quotes results in a
per bus unit cost of $69,303.57 for a Call-n-Ride bus and $65,371.03 for an Access-a-Ride bus.
Staff is requesting Board approval to exercise the option to Contract 25FK006 with Master’s
Transportation for the purchase of 44 additional Goshen cutaway buses. The new buses will replace 322011 Model Years Eldorado buses used for the Call-n-Ride service and 12 2007 and 2011 Model Year
buses used for the Access-a-Ride service.
DISCUSSION
The 2007 and 2011 Model Year cutaway buses to be replaced have exceeded their Federal Transit
Administration (FTA) service life of 5 years or 150,000 miles. They are currently over 7 years old and
have accumulated on the average of 190,000 miles. They require intensive maintenance to keep them
in service.
The new ADA cutaway buses will conform to the configuration that was developed in cooperation with
the disability community several years ago during the initial 2015/2016 procurement of ADA cutaway
buses. The new Goshen cutaway buses will be up to 24’ long. The buses will be equipped with an
extended sized wheelchair lift to accommodate large sized wheelchairs, two wheelchair access areas for
the Call-n-Ride buses and three wheelchair access areas for the Access-a-Ride buses to allow for ADA
compliance. The buses will also be equipped with a security camera system per the current standard on
all new RTD buses.

Packet Pg. 65

11.B

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The funding for this contract amendment is included in the District’s 2018 Adopted Budget.
DBE PARTICIPATION
There is no DBE requirement for transit vehicle purchases. Each vehicle manufacturer is required by the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to submit a DBE plan for FTA approval. As part of the required
proposal submittal documents, Master’s Transportation selected bus manufacturer, Goshen, has
submitted a certificate attesting to FTA's approval of its DBE plan.
ALTERNATIVES
1. To authorize the General Manager or his designee, to award the Contract Option to Master’s
Transportation for the purchase of 44 cutaway buses at a price not to exceed $3,100,654. This
is the recommended alternative.
2. Do not authorize the contract and re-solicit bids. This is not recommended as it would result, at
the very least, in a delay of the delivery of the buses and may increase the cost to the project.

Subject:

Code of Ethics Approval

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: February 6, 2018
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: February 27, 2018

RECOMMENDED ACTION
The Finance Administration & Audit Committee recommends that the Board of Directors approve the
attached RTD Code of Ethics.
BACKGROUND
The Board of Directors approved the current RTD Code of Ethics (Code) 15 years ago, on January 21,
2003. RTD’s current Code narrowly meets Federal Transit Administration (FTA) requirements that RTD
have a Board-approved code of ethics applicable to the Board as well as to RTD employees with
responsibility for procurement. However, while such a “procurement code of ethics” provides guidance
for Directors and a small subset of RTD employees, and protection for RTD in situations related to
contractual relationships, it fails to apply to the rest of RTD’s employees, and fails to provide Directors
and staff with broader, more basic ethical standards to which all RTD representatives should adhere.
RTD’s current Code has long caused confusion because while it is given to all RTD employees in
training, only a small subset of RTD employees are actually subject to its terms. The current Code also
needs updating to adhere to current legal requirements.
Staff provided a new, draft Code of Ethics to the Finance Administration & Audit Committee as an
informational item in January, seeking comments and suggestions. In response, Directors asked that the
Code specifically reference the concepts of impartiality and avoiding appearances of impropriety; and
make clear that the Code is a Board-adopted policy, while accompanying examples and explanatory
commentary are not policy but procedures. After providing several weeks for any additional comments
or requests, staff incorporated all Director’s suggestions into a new draft. Staff is now requesting
approval of the new Code of Ethics.
DISCUSSION
RTD decided that updating the RTD Code of Ethics was a valuable project to accomplish in the 2017
Leadership Academy. A Leadership Academy team of RTD represented and salaried employees - Raleigh
Elstun, Todd Keir, Corey Petzinger, and Karl Shoemaker – took on the task, sponsored and mentored by
RTD’s General Counsel and Pam Kachka in the Education, Training & Development Division.
The proposed new RTD Code of Ethics started as a clean sheet. The Leadership Academy team
collaborated, set goals, planned the work, and then worked their plan. The team identified current FTA
requirements and researched other transit agency Codes of Ethics (Sound Transit, MBTA, BC Transit,
and SEPTA) for ideas and guidance.
The team and General Counsel ultimately decided to create a two-part Code of Ethics, with the main
part pertaining to all employees, and a smaller part with additional standards for Directors and employees
with fiduciary responsibilities. This arrangement was determined to be optimal for clarity, simplicity,
functionality, and general applicability for all employees.

Packet Pg. 67

11.C

Unlike the current Code, the new Code of Ethics is much shorter, far less technical in language, and
goes beyond procurement to express basic ethical standards applicable to all RTD representatives:
Integrity, Honesty, Inclusivity, Transparency, and Sustainability.
Instead of the current document in which examples and explanatory comments are part of the Boardapproved Code and can therefore only be updated or revised through formal Board action, the proposed
Code offloads such examples and comments into a separate procedural document. RTD’s General
Counsel will maintain and update that document under RTD’s standard methods for revising, publicizing
and maintaining procedures, following notification to and opportunity for comment by the Board and the
Senior Leadership Team. (In response to Committee comments in January, the new Code has been
revised to make clear that those procedures are not themselves policies.) This approach keeps the Boardapproved Code of Ethics clean and simple, and allows for regular updating of examples as necessary to
ensure that they stay relevant and address current concerns and questions.
The proposed new Code addresses changes in law since 2003, and applies monetary standards for gifts
based on those now applicable to other public employees under the Colorado Constitution (through the
ballot initiative Amendment 41).
The Leadership Academy team gave presentations and conducted interviews with many RTD
stakeholders including Safety, Security, Legal, Civil Rights, Human Resources, Labor Relations, Asset
Management, and RTD’s General Manager. The team also provided drafts to the Union for review and
comment. This outreach provided invaluable information and perspectives to aid the team to create the
most relevant and highest quality Code of Ethics possible. The new Code of Ethics submitted for
adoption by the Board of Directors is an original document that satisfies legal requirements as well as
major stakeholders’ wishes.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no adverse financial impact to adopting the new Code of Ethics. There will be minor costs in
printing and distributing the new Code and obtaining approvals. RTD already conducts training
courses in ethics to new and other employees. RTD will educate employees on the Code of Ethics
and is planning to roll out training and education within RTD’s existing education and training
budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. The Finance Administration & Audit Committee recommends that the Board of Directors approve
the attached RTD Code of Ethics Adopt the new Code of Ethics. This is the recommended
action.
2. Do not adopt the new Code of Ethics, and instead return the new Code to staff for further
revision. This is not recommended, as the new Code has already undergone substantial review
including incorporation of all comments received at and after last month’s Finance Administration
& Audit Committee meeting.

A.

Introduction

This RTD Code of Ethics provides mandatory standards and guidance on ethical behavior
and choices for all of us at RTD: our employees and directors. We will use this Code of Ethics to
guide our daily decisions and actions.

Attachment: COE Redlined (3393 : Code of Ethics Approval)

All of us at RTD are expected to be ethical role models. We must all all be alert to
potential ethical issues and be ready to respond appropriately. We must avoid conduct which
creates an appearance of impropriety. Those of us who supervise others must foster an
atmosphere that encourages everyone to seek help if faced with ethical dilemmas.
Responsibility for compliance with standards for ethical conduct ultimately rests with each one
of us.
A key goal of this Code is to promote integrity by preventing conflicts of interest.
Conflicts between our RTD roles and our private interests, whether real or perceived, must be
avoided.
This Code also supports an environment at RTD of honesty, trust, inclusivity and
sustainability: a just culture with sincere, respectful and open communications.
This Code contains five main parts. The first part identifies five basic ethics standards
that apply to all of us at RTD. The second part contains rules limiting RTD contracts with
current and former RTD employees who have responsibility for or influence upon procurement
decisions, including all RTD managers and directors. The third part concerns annual disclosures
by those with responsibility for procurement decisions. The fourth part explains how to get
advice about the Code and states how RTD enforces the Code, including penalties for violation.
The fifth part provides more resources to help interpret the Code, including citations to relevant
legal standards.
The rules in this Code are simple, reasonable, and grounded in common
sense. This Code clearly states expectations for all RTD employees. A claim of lack of
knowledge or understanding of this Code will not be accepted.
No code of ethics can anticipate every possible situation, and this Code of Ethics does
not repeal other rules relating to ethical conduct that may apply. We must be familiar and
comply with all laws, standards and rules related to our specific jobs. To help in applying the
rules in this Code, RTD’s General Counsel will issue comments and examples applying the Code
to situations that may come up. These comments and examples will be approved by the Senior
Leadership Team as official RTD policies and procedures. In addition, RTD provides ethics
training and resources to apply this Code to situations you are likely to encounter. If you are
ever unsure whether anything you do may violate this Code, contact RTD’s General Counsel for
a written advisory opinion before you take action.
This 2018 revision of RTD’s Code of Ethics was led by an RTD Leadership Academy team

consisting of represented and salaried employees. After internal reviews and solicitation of
comments from others, the Code of Ethics was approved and adopted by RTD’s Board of
Directors on _______________, 2018.

Five Basic Ethics Standards for All of Us at RTD

Attachment: COE Redlined (3393 : Code of Ethics Approval)

This part of the Code contains five basic ethics standards that apply to each of us: all
RTD employees regardless of position, plus RTD directors (also referred to as “employees” in
this part). These standards are: integrity, honesty, inclusivity, transparency, and sustainability.

1. Integrity
We will avoid conflicts of interest and promote public confidence in the
integrity of RTD’s decisions.
1.1. We will not engage in outside business or activities that interfere with official
RTD duties and responsibilities, or in official RTD duties and responsibilities that
directly affect an employee’s outside business or activities.
1.1.1.2. We will be impartial in carrying out our duties, and will avoid actions
which create an appearance of impropriety.
1.2.1.3. We will not use our positions for personal gain or private benefit, whether
for ourselves or for our families, acquaintances, or businesses.
1.3.1.4. We will not offer, or give in response to solicitation, any item of monetary
value to anyone from whom we are seeking official action.
1.4.1.5. No director, officer, employee, or agent of RTD will be interested in any
contract or transaction with RTD except in his or her official representative
capacity.
1.5.1.6. RTD’s officers, employees, agents, or board members will neither solicit
nor accept gifts, gratuities, favors, or anything of monetary value from
contractors, potential contractors, or parties to subcontracts unless the financial
interest is not substantial or the gift is an unsolicited item of nominal intrinsic
value. For purposes of determining whether monetary value is “not substantial”
or of “nominal intrinsic value,” RTD applies the current dollar limits in Colorado

C.

Contracts with Current and Former Employees

For RTD employees who have responsibility for procurements or who are engaged in the
award or administration of contracts, RTD is generally prohibited from entering into contracts
with such employees, or with such former employees within one year of termination of
employment.

1. Contracts with Current Employees
RTD will not enter into any transaction involving goods, services or
property with an RTD employee, or with a person or entity in which an
RTD employee has an interest.
RTD employees are considered to have an interest in transactions involving:
1. Any immediate family member (spouse or domestic partner, and their
parents, children, brothers and sisters)
2. Any person or entity with whom an RTD employee has an agreement to
receive (or reasonable expectation of receiving) any benefit
3. Any entity in which an employee is a director, officer, employee, prospective

employee, or shareholder
4. Any debtor of the employee
This section will not apply in the case of:
1. Remote interests: non-paid volunteers or officers of a nonprofit; less than
5% ownership of shares in a business; solely representative capacity such as
a receiver, trustee or administrator.

Attachment: COE Redlined (3393 : Code of Ethics Approval)

2. An entity that is the only available source for essential goods, services or
property.
3. A financial institution holding RTD funds, or RTD borrowing funds from a
financial institution that offers the lowest available rate of interest for the
loan.
4. Emergency situations, provided that a record explaining the emergency
situation is prepared by the General Manager and submitted to the Board of
Directors at its next regular meeting.
5. Contracts entered into with full disclosure and knowledge of the conflict, and
approval of the contract, by the Board of Directors.
Any such exceptions must be fully disclosed and documented in the contract file.

2. Contracts with Former Employees
RTD will not contract with, or take any act favorably affecting, any person,
or any entity represented by a person, who has within the preceding one

contract or would have had influence over decisions related to the contract, that
person cannot now benefit from the contract.
This sections does not apply to employment of retirees or temporary adjunct
employment under standard policies approved by RTD’s Human Resources Division.
This section will not apply in cases where a contract involving a current employee
would be exempted. Any such exceptions must be fully disclosed and documented in

Annual Disclosure

Employees in positions determined by RTD to be responsible for
procurements or engaged in the award or administration of contracts must
complete and submit to the General Counsel an interest disclosure form subject to
procedures approved by the Senior Leadership Team.

E.

Attachment: COE Redlined (3393 : Code of Ethics Approval)

The disclosure form is kept confidential and is used to create a general, nonpersonalized list of those persons or entities with whom RTD may be restricted from doing
business. No financial data is required. Proposed transactions are compared with the list to see
if there are relationships that could cause a conflict of interest, in which case the General
Counsel and Senior Manager of Materials Management will consult.

Advice, Enforcement, and Penalties for Violation

If you are unsure as to whether an action may violate this Code of Ethics, you should
first consult the comments and examples in RTD’s official policies and procedures, and then
contact RTD’s General Counsel if you still have questions. If you are ever unsure whether
anything you do may violate this Code, contact the General Counsel for a written advisory
opinion before taking action.
An employee or director violating this Code of Ethics may be subject to discipline up to
and including termination of employment, or such action or penalties as authorized by RTD’s
Bylaws, respectively, in addition to any other penalties authorized by law.
A contractor’s or agent’s contract with RTD may include terms incorporating all or part
of this Code of Ethics and treating contractor employees as RTD employees for such purposes.
Violation of this Code may be considered a breach of the contract with RTD or grounds for
disbarment from future RTD contracts.

Construction and Authority

The RTD Board of Directors has approved this Code of Ethics. This Code replaces all
prior Codes, but does not repeal other rules relating to ethical conduct that may apply.
This Code of Ethics is to be construed liberally to promote its purposes and to
supplement such other rules, regulations and laws as may apply.
This Code of Ethics is prospective, not retroactive, in application. The provisions of this
Code are severable; i.e., if any of its provisions are deemed unconstitutional or invalid, that will
not affect or impair any of the remaining provisions.

A.

Introduction

All of us at RTD are expected to be ethical role models. We must all be alert to potential
ethical issues and be ready to respond appropriately. We must avoid conduct that creates an
appearance of impropriety to a reasonable person. Those of us who supervise others must
foster an atmosphere that encourages everyone to seek help if faced with ethical dilemmas.
Responsibility for compliance with standards for ethical conduct ultimately rests with each one
of us.
A key goal of this Code is to promote integrity by preventing conflicts of interest.
Conflicts between our RTD roles and our private interests, whether real or perceived, must be
avoided.
This Code also supports an environment at RTD of honesty, trust, inclusivity and
sustainability: a just culture with sincere, respectful and open communications.
This Code contains five main parts. The first part identifies five basic ethics standards
that apply to all of us at RTD. The second part contains rules limiting RTD contracts with
current and former RTD employees who have responsibility for or influence upon procurement
decisions, including all RTD managers and directors. The third part concerns annual disclosures
by those with responsibility for procurement decisions. The fourth part explains how to get
advice about the Code and states how RTD enforces the Code, including penalties for violation.
The fifth part provides more resources to help interpret the Code, including citations to relevant
legal standards.
The rules in this Code are simple, reasonable, and grounded in common
sense. This Code clearly states expectations for all RTD employees. A claim of lack of
knowledge or understanding of this Code will not be accepted.
No code of ethics can anticipate every possible situation, and this Code of Ethics does
not repeal other rules relating to ethical conduct that may apply. We must be familiar and
comply with all laws, standards and rules related to our specific jobs. To help in applying the
rules in this Code, RTD’s General Counsel will issue comments and examples applying the Code
to situations that may come up. These comments and examples will be approved by the Senior
Leadership Team as official RTD procedures. In addition, RTD provides ethics training and
resources to apply this Code to situations you are likely to encounter. If you are ever unsure
whether anything you do may violate this Code, contact RTD’s General Counsel for a written
advisory opinion before you take action.
This 2018 revision of RTD’s Code of Ethics was led by an RTD Leadership Academy team

consisting of represented and salaried employees. After internal reviews and solicitation of
comments from others, the Code of Ethics was approved and adopted by RTD’s Board of
Directors on February 27, 2018.

Five Basic Ethics Standards for All of Us at RTD

This part of the Code contains five basic ethics standards that apply to each of us: all
RTD employees regardless of position, plus RTD directors (also referred to as “employees” in
this part). These standards are: integrity, honesty, inclusivity, transparency, and sustainability.

1. Integrity
We will avoid conflicts of interest and promote public confidence in the
integrity of RTD’s decisions.
1.1. We will not engage in outside business or activities that unduly interfere with
official RTD duties and responsibilities, or in official RTD duties and
responsibilities that directly impact an employee’s outside business or activities.
1.2. We will be impartial in carrying out our duties, and will avoid actions that create
an appearance of impropriety to a reasonable person.
1.3. We will not use our positions for personal gain or private benefit, whether for
ourselves or for our families, acquaintances, or businesses.
1.4. We will not offer, or give in response to solicitation, any item of monetary value
to anyone from whom we are seeking official action.
1.5. No director, officer, employee, or agent of RTD will have an interest in any
contract or transaction with RTD except in his or her official representative
capacity.
1.6. RTD’s officers, employees, agents, or board members will neither solicit nor
accept gifts, gratuities, favors, or anything of monetary value from contractors,
potential contractors, or parties to subcontracts unless the financial interest is
not substantial or the gift is an unsolicited item of nominal intrinsic value. For
purposes of determining whether monetary value is “not substantial” or of
“nominal intrinsic value,” RTD applies the current dollar limits in Colorado

others, respect the diversity of the communities we serve, and promote a
work environment free from unlawful discrimination and harassment.
3.1. We will treat each other, our customers, contractors, partners, and members of
the public with respect.
3.2. We will not unlawfully harass or discriminate against other employees, our
customers, contractors, partners, and members of the public.

Contracts with Current and Former Employees

For RTD employees who have responsibility for procurements or who are engaged in the
award or administration of contracts, RTD is generally prohibited from entering into contracts
with such employees, or with such former employees within one year of termination of
employment.

1. Contracts with Current Employees
RTD will not enter into any transaction involving goods, services or
property with an RTD employee, or with a person or entity in which an
RTD employee has an interest.
RTD employees are considered to have an interest in transactions involving:
1. Any immediate family member (spouse or domestic partner, and their
parents, children, brothers and sisters)
2. Any person or entity with whom an RTD employee has an agreement to
receive (or reasonable expectation of receiving) any benefit
3. Any entity in which an employee is a director, officer, employee, prospective

William C. Van Meter, Assistant General
Manager, Planning

GM

Date:

Subject:

Transit Oriented Development Evaluation
Guidelines

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning, Capital Programs and FasTracks Committee that the Board of
Directors approve the attached Resolution Number
(the “Resolution”), the “Transit Oriented
Development Evaluation Guidelines” to provide policy direction to RTD staff on evaluating transit
oriented development (TOD) projects moving forward.
BACKGROUND
RTD has invested over $5.8 billion dollars in the rapid transit network for the Denver Metropolitan
Region since 2004. A direct result of this investment and previous rapid transit investments by RTD is a
tremendous level of interest in TOD at or adjacent to stations along RTD’s rapid transit network. In
2016, the Board initiated RTD TOD Assessment was completed by outside consultants. The final report
for the TOD Assessment indicated that RTD would benefit from “achieving mission clarity” on TOD by
more clearly defining the value of TOD for the agency.
DISCUSSION
RTD’s current policy guidance for TOD, including the Strategic Plan for TOD (2010), provides limited
guidance on how RTD should access the value of TOD for the agency. Policy issues related to fiscal
sustainability, social equity, and safety and security are not clearly articulated in the Strategic Plan for
TOD and other policy documents. Clear direction on how to evaluate these policy issues would provide
more transparency and clarity in decision making for TOD projects for both internal staff and outside
stakeholders including local jurisdictions and developers.
It would therefore be beneficial to have TOD evaluation guidelines to provide a clearer direction to RTD
staff and external stakeholders on TOD projects. Draft TOD Evaluation Guidelines were presented at the
December 5th Planning, Capital Programs, and FasTracks Committee meeting. Board feedback on the
draft guidelines was provided at the meeting.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no expected direct financial impact of this resolution. This resolution requires that financial
implications be considered as part of any decision related to TOD projects.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Approve the attached Resolution Number
_
(the “Resolution”), the Transit Oriented
Development (TOD) Evaluation Guidelines, that is recommended by the Planning, Capital
Programs and FasTracks Committee, to provide policy direction to RTD staff on evaluating TOD
projects moving forward.

2. Do not adopt resolution. Continue to operate with limited policy guidance and allow for
continued inconsistency with decision making on the value of TOD projects to RTD.

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT
RESOLUTION NO. ____, SERIES OF 2018
(Transit Oriented Development Evaluation Guidelines)
A RESOLUTION PROVIDING POLICY GUIDANCE ON EVALUATING THE VALUE OF
TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT TO THE RTD.
WHEREAS, The Regional Transportation District plans, designs, builds and operates mass
transit for the Denver region; and
WHEREAS, the provision of transit service to the Denver region by RTD influences
development patterns and supports transit oriented development; and
WHEREAS, decisions on transit oriented development at RTD are governed by RTD
statutes and a broad set of internal policies including RTD’s Strategic Plan for TOD (2010),
Policy for Joint Development and Disposition of Real Property (RTD Resolution 15, Series
of 2015), Unsolicited Proposal Policy for Real Property (RTD Resolution 16, Series of
2015), and Parking Guiding Principles (Resolution 24, Series of 2016).
WHEREAS, RTD staff would benefit from additional policy guidance from the RTD Board of
Directors on evaluating TOD projects.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE REGIONAL
TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT TO ADOPT THE FOLLOWING EVALUATION GUIDELINES
FOR TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS:
TOD Evaluation Guidelines
A transit-oriented development (TOD) project occurring on or adjacent to RTD property will
inevitably affect RTD. When RTD is in a position to influence the TOD project, either by
entering into an agreement with the developer or jurisdiction, or through regulatory means,
and a decision is required regarding RTD’s participation, RTD must consider the value of
the TOD project to RTD.
The principles and evaluation factors below were developed to guide RTD staff’s
assessment of the TOD project’s value. As every TOD project is unique, each one will be
evaluated on a case-by-case basis according to its total impact (positive or negative) to
RTD.
TOD Value Principles
The following principles set clear standards and thresholds for new TOD projects. Every
new TOD project is expected to satisfy all six principles.

Packet Pg. 95

12.D

1. The TOD project must be budget neutral or budget positive for RTD.
Evaluations of budget impact should take into account direct revenue to RTD,
including property sale or lease revenue, increased fare revenue, or other revenue
sources. Replacement, major rehabilitation, maintenance, administrative, and other
operational costs, as well as any capital expenditures, should be considered over
the long and short terms.
2. The TOD project must be expected to increase ridership.
The proposer must demonstrate that ridership is reasonably projected to increase as
a result of project implementation including having ridership projections reviewed
and approved by RTD staff. Ridership increases over the short and long-term will
be considered, but short term increases are preferred.
3. Where feasible, ground leases of RTD property are preferred over sales.
RTD prefers to retain a fee interest in property. In some cases, such as condo
development or an unfavorable economy, a ground lease may not be feasible, and a
land sale should be considered. In cases where a sale is considered, RTD should
take such actions that will preserve RTD’s long term interest.
4. The TOD project must reflect the Parking Guiding Principles (PGP).
RTD will evaluate third-party parking operations and parking replacement based on
the factors described in the PGP or such other relevant guidance provided by the
Board.
5. The TOD project must enhance safety and security.
The TOD project must positively contribute to the safety and security of the RTD
system by remedying any known problems at the site, as well as by addressing
issues of pedestrian safety and walkability, and by increasing “eyes on the street”
through activation.
6. The TOD project must have jurisdiction support.
The TOD project must be consistent with the local jurisdiction’s plans and the
jurisdiction, formally or informally, must demonstrate support for the project.
Evaluation Factors
TOD projects will additionally be measured against the following evaluation factors. Unlike
the TOD Value Principles, the evaluation factors should be considered as whole, with the
understanding that TOD projects may not satisfy all evaluation factors. In determining the
total impact of a TOD project to RTD, Tier One Factors should be given more weight than
Tier Two Factors.
Tier One Factors:
 Ground Lease/Land Sale
Revenue from a land sale or ground lease should support RTD’s fiscal sustainability.


Increased Ridership/Fare Revenues
Generating new ridership supports RTD’s mission and directly benefits RTD through
increased fare revenues.

Packet Pg. 96

12.D



Replacement or New Facilities
Leveraging development to provide new or replacement facilities that are needed for
transit operations supports a state of good repair as determined by RTD (the value
of the facility may be large, such as for a new parking structure, or small, such as
for a Driver Relief Station).



Outsourced Maintenance
Assigning maintenance responsibilities, such as landscaping, cleaning, general
maintenance, snow and ice removal, and graffiti removal, to a third party in a
manner that is consistent with RTD standards and does not increase RTD’s
administrative burden reduces costs and risks for RTD.



Jurisdiction Support
Jurisdiction support for a TOD project beyond basic planning demonstrates the
importance of the project to the local community. Demonstrations of strong
jurisdiction support might include updating zoning, providing financial support,
employing Tax Increment Financing (TIF), contributing to capital projects that
support the TOD project, or assuming part of the TOD project’s risk.



Enhanced RTD Operations
Improved transit operations through more efficient routing, more optimal transfers,
or other operational efficiencies directly benefit RTD.

Tier Two Factors:


Improved Safety/Security
Addressing safety and security issues such as emergency ingress and egress,
fire/life/safety communication, lighting and tripping hazards will positively impact
RTD. The activation of previously isolated stations also positively impacts security.



Upgraded Rider Amenities/Access
Upgraded rider amenities or increased options or access to RTD transit improve the
rider experience and may include improved seating, vending, walkways, open
space, wayfinding, and First Mile/Last Mile solutions.



Community Facilities/Affordable Housing
RTD supports and benefits from community facilities and/or affordable housing at
TOD projects that are consistent with local jurisdiction policies.



Brand Image Enhancement
RTD’s brand is enhanced and RTD benefits as a whole when RTD is positively
associated with a TOD project that supports community objectives.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

Date: February 8, 2018

From:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

February 8, 2018

Board Meeting Date: February 27, 2018

Subject:

Recommended
Services

Changes

to

Special

Event

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the following changes to Special Event services:
1. Discontinue RockiesRide bus service and authorize staff to develop alternative service configurations
to serve Longmont and Wagon Road/Thornton on Rockies games weekends; and
2. Discontinue RTD RACE service to the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure event.
BACKGROUND
1. RockiesRide - Major League Baseball expanded to include the Colorado Rockies in 1993 and
RockiesRide service began that same year. The service operated with 12 routes to 23 Park-n-Rides
and ran approximately 175 buses to all home games. Over the years, service levels have been
adjusted to better match ridership. In 2017, the service was reduced to just two routes serving four
Park-n-Rides (8th & Coffman and 815 South Main in Longmont and Wagon Road and Thornton parkn-Rides). Service operated on Opening Day, for Saturday and Sunday games, and for fireworks
games; most games operated with six buses. In 2017, there were an average of 472 boardings per
game (approximately 236 RTD passengers) for the two routes. In 2015, RockiesRide service
operated at a $16.84 subsidy per passenger boarding versus $5.15 subsidy per boarding for
BroncosRide service that same year. In 2016, RockiesRide service operated at a cost per boarding of
$20.96 versus a cost per boarding of $10.07 for BroncosRide service. Costs for 2017 have not yet
been calculated pending the final close of the 2017 financial books.
Since the opening of Coors Field, the Colorado Rockies have allowed RockiesRide buses to use the
parking lot located on the corner of Wazee St. and 22nd Ave. (Rockies-Lot) to board and de-board
passengers. In November 2017, the Colorado Rockies notified RTD the Rockies-Lot would no longer
be available. Due to construction, the Colorado Rockies are required to relocate parking from another
location to the Rockies-Lot. RockiesRide is no longer able to use the parking lot as it has used for
the past 24 years.
Due to the loss of parking at Coors Field, any bus service for passengers desiring to attend Rockies
games will be need to terminate at Denver Union station as do other RTD bus services from the north
metro area. Therefore, it is recommended that “RockiesRide” service as a free standing branded
sports ride service be discontinued and staff be authorized to develop alternative service
configurations to serve Longmont and Thornton areas on Rockies game weekends in order to serve
the ridership that does exist, especially on Sundays where no alternative service exists.
2. RACE - RTD began offering RACE Service to the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure event on

Packet Pg. 108

12.E

October 3rd, 1999. That year, the service operated with 20 buses from three (3) Park-n-Rides. Race
for the Cure attendance peaked at 65,350 in 2006. Peak boardings for RACE Service occurred in
2005 (12,671) and has generally ranged between 8,000 and 12,000 from 2001 and 2011. In
2017, Race for the Cure attendance dipped to 10,200 and RACE Service boardings dropped to an
all-time low of 786 (approximately 393 RTD passengers). As Race for the Cure participation has
declined, RTD boardings have followed suit.
It is recommended that RACE Service to the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure event be
discontinued due to low ridership and levels of event participation do not meet RTD service
standards.
DISCUSSION
1. RockiesRide - The Colorado Rockies offered to assist RTD in securing access to 21st St. between
Blake and Market for RockiesRide use to compensate for the loss of the Rockies-Lot parking. After
looking at this location, bus operations staff raised concerns as the location limits the number of
buses that can be used. Moreover, it constricts operations as driveways and alleys need to remain
clear. This location will not work for RTD operations. In addition, RTD service standards require a
minimum attendance of 40,000 persons in one location at one time to warrant consideration for
special event bus service. While previous attendance at Coors Field met this standard, recent
attendance figures would not meet the standard for special event bus service. Average attendance at
Coors Field for the 2017 season was 36,465.
Alternative service exists on the Routes 120X and LD/LX for customers on Weekdays and Saturdays.
No alternative service is available on Sundays and this reinforces the recommendation to authorize
staff to develop alternative service configurations to provide access to downtown Denver on Rockies
game weekends, especially Sunday, from the areas previously served by weekend RockiesRide
service.
2. RACE Service - The RTD service standard for event service requires 40,000 participants in one place
at one time. The 2017 Race for the Cure event participation (10,200) does not meet the RTD
service standard of 40,000 persons in one place at one time.
Alternative service exists on the Flat Iron Flyer for customers traveling from US36 & Table Mesa and
US-36 & McCaslin. No alternative service is available for passengers traveling from Wagon Road and
US-85 & Bridge.
Two public meetings were held on February 5 at 12:00 noon and 6:00 pm at the RTD Administrative
Offices. Listed below is a summary of the comments received at the public meetings and via phone and
email:

RTD Administrative Offices
12:00 noon
Staff in attendance included Dan Menter and Jessie Carter. There were six members from the public in
attendance, five of whom attended because of the RockiesRide proposed service changes. Comments
included the following:
 Concern for the elderly and ADA passengers who could not otherwise get to the game
 Sports-rides should be better marketed
 Perhaps use RockiesRide buses to back up regular service and add Sunday service on the route L

Jessie Carter addressed the individual who attended the meeting to share comments regarding
the route L and the 27 following the discussion of the RockiesRide service

No one in attendance spoke regarding the proposed elimination of the Race for the Cure service.
Monday, February 5, 2018
RTD Administrative Offices
6:00 pm
Staff in attendance included Dan Menter, Jessie Carter and Jonathan Wade. There were three members
from the public in attendance, all of whom attended because of the RockiesRide proposed service
changes. None of the attendees requested to speak or provide input at the meeting.
No one attended on behalf of Race for the Cure proposed service changes.
RTD staff received one phone call and three emails regarding the RockiesRide proposed service changes.
Those comments are summarized below:
 Phone (1): Phone conversation suggested RTD keep Saturday and Sunday only RockiesRide
Service.
 Email (3): Two emails were in support of RockiesRide claiming ridership from Longmont was
good and/or full. A third email shared several comments:
o Scheduled service alternatives are very limited and inconvenient on Saturdays and nonexistent on Sundays
o RTD does not market anything
o RTD requirement that buses wait 45 minutes after the game has a negative impact on
ridership
o RTD should consider an alternative loading/unloading location, i.e., layover in Union
Station and then load at top of Wewatta ramp post game
o Need a free shuttle between DUS and a convenient location near Wewatta and Park
Avenue
o Fares should be collected in both directions
o RockiesRide service should be a scheduled service, not a Special Service
o RTD needs to do a better job protecting for overloads on game days on the FF service
o RTD should contemplate how to generate more boardings systemwide, rather than cutting
services that people actually use
FINANCIAL IMPACT
1. RockiesRide – Eliminating the service saves approximately $108,000 annualized. Some of this
funding will be required to provide alternative service from the areas affected by the elimination of
service.
2. RACE – Eliminating the service saves approximately $16,800 annualized.

ALTERNATIVES:
1. Discontinue RockiesRide bus service and authorize staff to develop alternative service configurations
to serve Longmont and Wagon Road/Thornton on Rockies games weekends and discontinue RTD
RACE service to the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure event. This is the recommended alternative.

Packet Pg. 110

12.E

2. RockiesRide - Run the service out of Union Station. This alternative is not recommended because on
opening day and fireworks games RTD does not have the capacity to operate the service and the
service would duplicate existing service on the route L and the 120X, on all days except Sundays. In
addition, the service would not the minimum requirements of RTD’s adopted service standards.
3.

Race for the Cure – the existing service could be maintained but this alternative is not recommended
as it would be in violation of RTD service standards and has generated very low ridership in recent
years.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

From:

Heather McKillop,
Administration

Date:

February 6, 2018

Subject:

Authorization to enter into a contract with
DatamanUSA

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: February 6, 2018
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: February 27, 2018

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to award a contract
to DatamanUSA for ERP Work Order Contract (Contract Number 17DH023) for an amount not to exceed
$7,750,000 over 5 years. Work is administered on an as-needed, work order basis. Funding for these
Work Orders will be included in the budgets of the projects on which the work is performed.
BACKGROUND
RTD has need of an on-call contractor to provide support and enhancement of the functional and
technical capabilities within Oracle E-Business Suite – and planning and implementing the next logical
upgrade/alternatives of products and tools. The Work Orders (WOs) will be short to mid-term periods
addressing business, management of technology and consultant services. The activities are inclusive of all
activities necessary to support, enhance and update the Oracle Products and tools.
RTD has utilized an on-call contract of this nature for Oracle support for more than 10 years. During the
previous 5-year contract period, RTD spent a total of approximately $2.1 million on projects such as state
of good repair, business intelligence configuration and implementation, real time reporting, Oracle
advanced benefits assessment, open enrollment changes and updates, and Oracle hardware upgrades and
enhancements.
RTD anticipates the upcoming 5-year contract period may include work associated with several new
implementations including Inventory Planning, Contract Management, Budgeting, Human Capital
Management, Finance and Accounting, Enterprise Planning, and other ancillary systems. RTD will also use
this contract to assist in maintaining day-to-day operations of the existing Oracle system while the new
systems are being implemented. Other projects that may utilize work order assistance include real time
enhancements, business intelligence enhancements, open enrollment updates, Oracle hardware
configurations and upgrades, and system security enhancements.
DISCUSSION
RTD conducted an open procurement for an ERP Work Order contractor. Six firms submitted proposals.
The criteria used to evaluate the proposals was:

The five members of the evaluation team selected two firms for interviews. DatamanUSA was selected
as the successful proposer.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The contract authority shall not exceed $7,750,000 (including contingency). Funding for these Work
Orders will be included in the budgets of the projects on which the work is performed. The types of
funds are dependent upon the funding source of each individual project. Individual work orders will be
funded as the project requirement is processed. The amount is not to exceed $1,950,000.00 (including
contingency) in any one year.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to
award a contract to DatamanUSA for ERP Work Order Contract (Contract Number 17DH023) for
an amount not to exceed $7,750,000 over 5 years. Work is administered on an as-needed,
work order basis. Funding for these Work Orders will be included in the budgets of the projects
on which the work is performed.
2. Provide the needed services with RTD personnel. RTD personnel does not have the expertise or
capacity that can be provided by a work order contractor. This does not meet the needs of
RTD.
3. Advertise again and proceed with an entirely new procurement. This would take well over six
months and not likely result in an improved outcome.
