RFP/RFI/Procurement Process (Brian Iacono)
Brian Iacono, Sr. Manager for Materials Management, reviewed the presentation included
in the Study Session Agenda packet for February 24, 2015. The presentation included
purchasing authority/guidelines and procurement methods (Micro, Small, Sealed
Bid/Invitation for Bid, Competitive Proposal/Request for Proposals, and Non-competitive
Procurement/Sole Source).
Among the items highlighted, he noted that small purchases, those in excess of $3,000
but less than $100,000, are accomplished by obtaining oral or written quotations from a
minimum of two qualified sources. Brian Iacono mentioned that non-competitive
procurement, also known as sole source, needs to be a purchase exceeding $3,000.
Documentation must be submitted to justify only considering one entity.
At the end of the presentation, Brian Iacono made reference to the APTA Transit
Procurement Guide for Transit Board Members which was distributed to the Directors
during the Study Session. A copy of the guide is available at the Board Office. Director
Folska requested an accessible digital file of the document. The guide makes reference to
geographical preferences not being allowed as selection criteria but exemptions can be
made for design and engineering firms.
Brian Iacono told the Directors that any suppliers and/or contractors should be referred
back to him or his department. He said that Director interaction with suppliers/contractors
may give the impression of impropriety as well as impede staff with the negotiation
process. Brian Iacono noted that it is important to maintain the procurement process’
integrity by following the process and guidelines. The Senior Leadership Team ensures
that we follow all the rules and requirements. RTD needs to be responsible in spending the
tax payers money and has a reputation locally, nationally, and internationally of doing the
right thing. He told the Directors that they are part of the integrity of the process and
deserve a pat on the back for RTD’s reputation.
Brian Iacono noted that RTD follows the Federal Transit Administration (FTA)’s guidelines
for the unsolicited proposal process. It does not include real property but staff is
developing that policy for the Board for approval.
Chair Sisk thanked Brian Iacono for his wealth of knowledge and his vast 30 years’
experience.
Director Menten expressed her surprise in hearing that small purchases could be
accomplished with an oral quotation. She asked how often purchases were made in this
manner. Brian Iacono replied that 80% of purchases were made with written quotes. He

6.A

Director Menten asked how Buy America, the Department of Transportation’s provision to
ensure transportation infrastructure projects are built with American-made products,
affects the procurement process. Brian Iacono explained that Buy America under the FTA
requires that all iron, steel, and manufactured products used in the project are produced in
the United States. Rolling stock requires a minimum of 60% of all components and 100%
of final assembly to take place in the United States. Director Menten asked if these were
in place to ensure the quality of the product or to keep the investment in the United
States. Brian Iacono said that Buy America ensures both the quality of the product and
that the investment stays in the United States. Director Menten wondered what happens
when an item is not available in the United States. Brian Iacono said that Buy America
makes provisions for waivers and that this mostly happens on materials for building rail.
Director Menten inquired if there was a central website where different government
agencies could post their working bids in order for companies to maximize their time and
effort. Brian Iacono replied that he wishes that website would exist. He mentioned that
even in Colorado there are multiple listing venues, including RTD. RTD uses Quest
Construction Data Network, a cloud hosted service of no cost to the agency. Bidders are
charged a nominal fee ($5-$10) in order to download a project’s specs, RFB, etc. RTD
provides hard copies at no charge upon request. Director Menten noted that it seemed like
the free market was taking care of the bids. Brian Iacono agreed.
Director Lubow thanked Brian Iacono for his presentation and expertise. She asked for
confirmation that sole source is only used when necessary as RTD’s preference is
competitive procurement; if sole source is used it needs to be justified. Brian Iacono
affirmed Director Lubow’s statement. He said that the documentation needs to be
approved by himself, the Legal Department (Legal), and at times by General Manager Phil
Washington. He noted that some specific items are only available through sole source.
Director Bagley reminded the Directors that the commuter rail vehicles qualify under the
Buy America. He noted that the body of the vehicles is done in South Korea, assembled in
Philadelphia, and transported to Denver via rail. Brian Iacono added that his team ensures
that the project meets the requirements.
Director Bagley recalled the Eagle P3 procurement process. At the time, Directors James,
Tobiassen, and he were members of the Board. He said that the process was similar to

Packet Pg. 5

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 24, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

explained that quotation requests for small purchases are done in a more informal manner,
for example, via email. The FTA allows for oral quotations. He stated that RTD likes to
get most quotations in writing. Director Menten added that she imagines seeing an item’s
price on a website would constitute a written quotation. Brian Iacono agreed with Director
Menten.

6.A

Director Francone thanked Brian Iacono for a very enlightening presentation. She also
appreciated having the materials ahead of time. She asked why geography is not a
criterion except for architectural and engineering firms. Brian Iacono answered that the
FTA allows agencies to determine if there are enough local firms to be competitive. This
enables savings in traveling costs.
Director James thanked Brian Iacono for all the consultations throughout the years.
Director James asked Brian Iacono if he had heard of Rocky Mountain e-Purchasing
System. Brian Iacono replied that he was aware of Rocky Mountain e-Purchasing System
as well as other similar systems. He noted that he would like to have a conversation with
Phil Washington regarding available software services that could make the procurement
process more efficient. Director James noted that he is more aware of the system from a
real estate point of view. Director James thanked Phil Washington for directing staff to
develop a real property unsolicited proposal policy.
Director James asked Brian Iacono to address the real estate disposition and acquisition
process since real estate is more than products and services and may become a messier
procedure. He also wondered how to ensure competition in this process since the
standards are vaguer. Brian Iacono agreed that competition is healthy, and of good value
to the tax payers. He added that there are policies regarding disposition of assets (i.e.
used buses, equipment, etc.) Public auction is utilized and all dispositions are
documented. Disposition of real estate property is currently looked at on a case by case
basis. He reminded the Directors that recent real estate disposition was specific to a land
locked property. Staff is reviewing all the nuances and developments in the real estate
arena as they work on the real estate unsolicited proposal policy. Brian Iacono added that
transparency is key. Director James thanked Phil Washington for moving the real estate
process forward.
Director Walker noted that the procurement process presented by Brian Iacono is very
similar to other places he has worked across the country in both private and public
sectors. He agreed that consistency and competition is important. The integrity of RTD’s

Packet Pg. 6

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 24, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

drinking from a fire hose. He pointed out asking developers of the proposals for help in
writing the RFPs as one of the key elements of the process. This allowed for significant
community involvement and collaboration, adding value to the final $2.04 billion designbuild-finance-maintain-operate contract. Throughout the process, the Board received
updates via Executive Sessions before the final decision was made which was very
beneficial. He added that a similar process was used for the unsolicited proposals for the
I-225 and North Metro corridors. Brian Iacono added that the unsolicited proposals also
went through the Request For Information (RFI) process.

6.A

Director Tobiassen thanked Brian Iacono for his help whenever he has been contacted by
many entities regarding introductions and referrals. He asked Brian Iacono to explain the
complaint/protest process. Brian Iacono explained that the solicitation instructions clearly
articulate the protest and clarification process. He noted that RTD has not had any formal
protest or lawsuit in over 2 years. He attributed this to following RTD’s policies and
having a staff that does their job and homework. He noted that this sends the message
that Director Walker referred to: if contractors trust we are being fair and objective they
will chase our projects.
Director Tobiassen asked Brian Iacono how evaluators that have a relationship with
bidders are prevented from influencing the process. Brian Iacono pointed out that all RTD
employees that are involved at any capacity in the selection process have to fill out an
annual disclosure form. This form is handled by Legal. Once analyzed, Legal provides the
procurement office with a list of companies on the disclosure forms. He added that before
doing business with any of the companies listed, he has a conversation with Legal in order
to figure out the conflict and what to do to mitigate it. RTD’s code of ethics also calls for
any member of the evaluation team to excuse themselves from the process if any conflict
arises throughout the process.
Director Tobiassen wondered if Brian Iacono’s department finds itself with an end of year
surplus and how they go about managing it. Brian Iacono replied that RTD is a lean and
mean organization. The budget is spent early throughout the year. The end of year
surplus does not happen very frequently at RTD.
Director Folska thanked Brian Iacono for the clear and concise overview. She asked how
many employees worked in his department. Brian Iacono said his department consists of
35 employees: 20 purchasing agents, buyers, inventory control, specialists and contract
negotiators that help support internal and external customers and 15 represented part
clerks.
Director Hoy asked when the land disposal policy would be available. Phil Washington
said that the timeline will be discussed during the Transit Oriented Communities update
during the Planning and Development Committee meeting on Tuesday, March 3. The
policy will be brought to the Board within the next 30 to 60 days.
Director Hoy noted that from his past experience in the trucking business he has painful
memories of large amounts of money tied up in inventory. Naming inventory loss and
discontinued parts as a concern, Director Hoy asked about the internal policies to ensure

Packet Pg. 7

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 24, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

process is paramount in getting solid proposals. If not, we will see competition take a
nose dive.

6.A

Director Hoy wondered if the rebuilding of parts was a Collective Bargaining Agreement
(CBA) component. Phil Washington replied that it was part of the CBA agreement as to
what is rebuilt in house versus contracted out. He could provide the language for
clarification. He noted that union work and work that can be put out is watched very
closely. Phil Washington added that the in-house team does a great job. Director Hoy
added that RTD employees are very important and that he understands the CBA situation.
Chair Sisk noted that since he has been part of the Board of Directors he has had a
number of new friends that want to be introduced to RTD’s procurement process. He is
concerned about the ethics of giving anyone unintended priority. Chair Sisk said he wants
to have a clear policy directing calls to staff and not through the Directors. Brian Iacono
shared his concerned and reiterated to the Directors to refer any contact to him, who will
in turn refer them to the appropriate person within the organization. Brian Iacono noted
that it is common practice for him to give presentations and meet with business
owners/representatives and chambers of commerce to explain how RTD does business.
Chair Sisk recapped that the recommendation is to have the person or business contact
Brian Iacono directly.
Chair Sisk wondered how RTD allows itself to use information presented in an RFP that
may not have been selected. Brian Iacono noted that it would be a challenge to use
information the proposers identified that information as proprietary or confidential. He
added that in some major complex projects RTD has offered a stipend to the unselected
proposers in order to use information that will save RTD money. This may result in
additional cost up front but savings in the long run. Phil Washington used the Eagle
project as an example. He mentioned that proposers were asked to submit an Alternative
Technical Concepts (ATC) agreement at a stipend valued of $2.5 million. If accepted,
RTD would own the ATC. Those were reviewed and RTD ended up saving $305 million
on a $2.2 billion project. The savings were spread throughout the District and this was a
huge success. Phil Washington also noted that the Eagle RFP had a provision for$20
million compensation to selected contractors in the event that RTD backed out. He noted
that the ATC are used often and may be used on the Southeast extension.

Packet Pg. 8

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 24, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

that RTD has what we need on the shelves. Brian Iacono noted that RTD has over 27,000
items in inventory. It operates 172 rail cars and has 13 operating facilities. In order to
keep track of all parts, his department ensures that RTD has the right part at the right time
at the right place – not more, not less. There is a district goal to prevent stock outs as it
has a direct impact on the public. Brian Iacono mentioned that there are cycle counts
every day. His department works closely with the maintenance department to know when
something will be disposed. He noted that it takes a village communication wise in order
to run this aspect of RTD. He noted he is proud of his team for all they do, especially
finding out what mechanics need and finding additional space for storage.

Director Folska asked if RTD uses inventory management software. Brian Iacono replied
that RTD uses Oracle. It has a sophisticated process for tracking history, usage, etc. to
make recommendations. The software processes a daily report on what needs to be
restocked. He added that 3 to 4 staff review the report as the system does not allow for
inventory retirement knowledge. Director Folska noted that this is included in the State of
Good Repair as it ensures that we have what we need at the moment needed in order to
continue operations.

B. Citizens Advisory Committee
Cynthia Stovall, Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) Co-chair, commented that the
committee is looking forward to working with the Directors in the New Year. She
said that the January CAC meeting was cancelled due to weather so their first
meeting was held on February 18th. Rick Clarke, Assistant General Manager of
Capital Programs, provided the committee with an update of the entire FasTracks
system and Pauletta Tonilas, Senior Manager of Public Relations and Public
Information, presented information on Stand Up for Transportation Day. Cynthia
Stovall shared that the CAC is very excited to work with their local communities to
get them involved as well.
Cynthia Stovall invited the Directors to attend the next CAC quarterly meeting on
March 18th at Anschutz Medical Campus. She said the committee hopes this
meeting will generate a lot of participation from students, faculty and staff at the
Campus. There will be a presentation on the East and I-225 Lines as well as
beginning discussions on potential service changes when the lines open.
Cynthia Stovall shared that the committee is very excited that two-on-one meetings
have been scheduled with the Directors. The two discussion topics the committee
is proposing for the meetings are: (1) as RTD transitions from planning/construction
to operating/maintaining, how might the CAC role change over time and (2) how
might the CAC be able to help each Director individually in their District.
Director Folska expressed that she really values the input and dedication of the
CAC. She wonders if there is a place on the website where all the CAC members
are listed. Cynthia Stovall stated that there is a CAC webpage on the FasTracks
website that has each member’s picture and bio.

Committee Chair Hoy thanked the CAC for all their hard work. He reiterated that
their goal for the two-on-one meetings is to come away understanding the role the
CAC will take as RTD transitions from building to operating and how they can help
each individual Director.
Director Tobiassen commended the CAC for their continued support of the I-225
line.

C. Updates
Susan Wood, Planning Project Manager, and Andy Mutz, Engineering Project
Manager, reviewed a Power Point presentation with the Board that is
available in the March 3, 2015 FasTracks Monitoring Committee Agenda
Packet.
Susan Wood reminded the Board that the Southeast Extension is 2.3 miles
of transit service from Lincoln Avenue to RidgeGate Parkway at a cost of
$207 million. This is a project that has been submitted as part of the FTA
New Starts Funding. She said that this project was included in the
President’s 2016 budget for $92 million and received DRCOG Board
approval for inclusion in the 2040 Regional Transportation Plan (RTP). The
next steps are:
 March 2015: anticipate receipt of entry into Engineering
 Summer 2015: Submit final request for Full Funding Grant Agreement
(FFGA)
 Spring 2016: Anticipate receipt of FFGA
Andy Mutz noted that RTD received statements of qualifications from 7
teams. In January 2015 four teams were selected to continue through the
procurement process. The teams selected were:
 Balfour Beatty Infrastructure with Parson Brinkerhoff (serving as
prime contractor and performing systems and design work)
 Graham-Kraemer Joint Venture (prime contractor); Modern Railway
Systems (systems); Stantec (design)
 Kiewit (prime contractor); Mass Electric (systems); Hatch Mott
McDonald (design)
 Stacy Witbeck-Herzog-Wadsworth Joint Venture; Modern Railway
Systems (systems); STV (design)
He explained that the next steps in the procurement process are:
 March 2015: Advertise Request for Proposals (RFP)
 May 2015: Receive Proposals
 May – July 2015: Evaluate Proposals and Make Recommendations
for RTD Board Approval

Director Bagley commented that as a member of the Board from the
southern part of the metro area, he wanted to share how excited his
constituents are about this development. He said that anything he can to do
help move this forward he will do.

• Stand Up for Transportation Day Overview
General Manager Washington and Pauletta Tonilas reviewed a Power Point
presentation with the Board that is available in the March 3, 2015 FasTracks
Monitoring Committee Agenda Packet.
General Manager Washington stated that the current long term
transportation bill, MAP-21, is set to expire on May 31st, 2015. This was
originally a two year bill that was extended twice. He explained that the
goal of Stand Up for Transportation Day is to bring attention to the need for
a long term, sustainable transportation funding bill.
General Manager Washington highlighted the first slide titled “RTD’s Federal
Funding Picture”. This slide illustrates the impact locally that the federal
formula grants RTD each year, which is approximately 13% of total
revenues. He stressed that with no new federal funds RTD would have to
reduce overall service levels by 15% and eliminate 400 jobs.
Pauletta Tonilas shared that over 100 cities across the country have
committed to participating on April 9th. She said that she recently attended
an APTA Marketing and Communications Conference with Scott Reed,
Assistant General Manager of Communications, and the buzz was all about
Stand Up for Transportation. People were very excited to participate in this
day and look to RTD as to what they can do in their cities.
General Manager Washington noted that there are a number of national
officials that RTD is encouraging to get out into the field an attend one of
the events. General Manager Washington and Congressman Ed Perlmutter

Chair Sisk inquired about the process by which stakeholder involvement
would be requested. He wanted to ensure it would be in a similar manner as
the stakeholder involvement during the North Metro Rail proposal evaluation
process. Andy Mutz stated that staff was definitely planning on engaging
the stakeholders during the review process and seeking their input as with
the North Metro evaluation.

6.B

Director Anderson asked if national partners such as the National League of
Cities and the National Association of Counties had been engaged. She also
wonders if perhaps the Directors should work with their cities, chambers of
commerce, etc. to request proclamations. General Manager Washington
explained that the APTA staff is engaging our national organizations such as
the National League of Cities and the National Chamber of Commerce while
RTD is reaching out at the local level. He said that there is also a resource
tool kit on the APTA website to help other agencies. General Manager
Washington stated that he would absolutely like for the Directors to work
with the various entities in their Districts to get additional proclamations.
Director James commented that at a grass roots level, the annual Road
Ahead event on April 2nd, one week before this event, might be a great
opportunity to get in front of several hundred people who are interested in
transportation.
Director Walker inquired if participants were only from larger cities/agencies
or if it was a mix. He noted that usually the only time transit enters the
national picture is when a large agency goes on strike. He hopes this event
will spur a sense of urgency that is needed to keep this country functioning
as there are many people outside major cities that really depend on
transportation. General Manager Washington stated that there was a really
good mix of participation around the country of not just transit agencies, but
entities interested in transportation across the board.
Director Folska believes this is a phenomenal way to get the attention of our
legislators. She encouraged staff to reach out to the elected officials
outside the RTD District as well because what RTD does in the District
impacts in entire state.
Director Francone asked what RTD’s budget is for the event. Pauletta
Tonilas said that we are really doing this on a shoestring budget with lots of
volunteers and help from our partners. She said this campaign has really
been at a grass roots level. The total budget for RTD was $30K.
Director Bagley requested staff create a draft proclamation that they could
supply to the Board. Pauletta Tonilas said that was a great suggestion that
she will work on with her team.
Director Solano suggested that perhaps the non-profit radio community
might be a good venue for publicizing this event. Pauletta Tonilas noted that
Packet Pg. 14

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 3, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

have personally invited USDOT Secretary Anthony Fox to Denver for this
event; additionally, Governor John Hickenlooper will sign a proclamation in
support of Stand Up for Transportation.

media outreach is a big part of the plan and she will look to add those
entities to the list.

Director Tobiassen shared that he and Director Folska would be attending
the Aurora Chamber Transportation Meeting the next day. He asked if there
were any handouts that staff could provide for the meeting. Pauletta
Tonilas said she would send out some material this evening.
Chair Sisk thanked everyone involved for their hard work on this event. He
wondered if perhaps a computer could be available for each of the District
tours so people could sign the petition. He thinks that perhaps a friendly
competition of what District gets the most signatures might be a fun way to
encourage people to sign. Pauletta Tonilas stated that in addition to having
a laptop or iPad, they will also be able to help people access it on their
phones.
Committee Chair Hoy volunteered Smart Commute Metro North’s help in his
District. He said they would be very happy to assist in the event. He
inquired if the dates for the District tours had been confirmed. Pauletta
Tonilas said the dates would be finalized tomorrow.
Committee Chair Hoy thinks this is a great promotion for transportation. He
thanked everyone on the staff that has worked so hard to pull this event
together, especially General Manager Washington since this was his idea.
He believes this will really bring awareness of the need for transportation
funding to people across the nation.
General Manager Washington commented that this would be a topic of
conversation at the APTA Legislative Conference next week. He asked the
Directors that are attending to make sure they have handouts, talking points,
etc. for this event when they visit our Congressional delegation.

There were no other matters.

General Manager Washington stated that there will also be a huge media
push on the national level that APTA is coordinating. There will be articles
in USA Today, The Wall Street Journal, etc. He said the day of there will be
a “Thunder Clap” where people from all over the country send the same
message at the same time from social media platforms like Twitter and
Facebook.

B. Updates

• Local Government Update - CRL Associates
Sherry Ellebracht, Government Relations Officer, told the Directors that
Roger Sherman from CRL Associates was not in attendance due to an
illness. He sent a written update that Sherry Ellebracht read to the
Directors.
The update mentioned CRL Associates attendance at the Full Metro Mayors
Caucus Meeting on February 4th and the Colorado City and County
Management Association Winter Conference from February 26th-28th. CRL
Associates also met with Committee Chair Folska and Committee Vice-Chair
Francone and look forward to working with the Committee’s leadership.
Sherry Ellebracht noted that CRL Associates is monitoring the Denver
elections as well as the issues dominating the races. They have been in
contact with all the candidates for the open seats. CRL Associates have
also spent time coordinating with Brandeberry~McKenna keeping the Local
Government updated on the Public Private Partnership Bill that was
postponed indefinitely by the State Senate.

• State Legislative Update - Brandeberry~McKenna Public Affairs
Jenifer Brandeberry, from Brandeberry ~ McKenna, informed the Directors
that her team met with the Governor’s Office on Friday, February 27th.
During that meeting the Governor’s Office committed to making a
proclamation for Stand Up for Transportation Day on April 9th, 2015. Stand
Up for Transportation Day was referenced during the FasTracks Monitoring
Committee meeting prior to the Government Relations Committee. Jenifer
Packet Pg. 18

Directors Archuleta and Lasater participated via remote.

Brandeberry said that she appreciated the work of Pauletta Tonilas, Senior
Manager for Public Relations and Public Information, and her team.

Senator Randy Baumgardner, Senate Transportation Committee Chair,
requested a tour of DIA’s component of the East Line Project. On the way
to DIA the Senate Transportation Committee members (Hon. Ray Scott,
Hon. John Cooke, Hon. Leroy Garcia, and Hon. Nancy Todd) will be updated
on the Eagle P3 Project.
The Community College of Denver made a presentation to the Business,
Labor, Economic, & Workforce Development Caucus on the WIN program.
This presentation was part of trending topics throughout the legislature.
She commended RTD for their work on the WIN program.
Jenifer Brandeberry mentioned that the Construction Defect Bill is now
Senate Bill 177. It has a late bill status and it is currently in negotiations
before being calendared. One of the addenda being considered is an
affordable housing piece. Brandeberry ~ McKenna will keep the Directors
updated.
She noted that the last half of the legislative session will have more activity.
The March revenue forecast comes out in the next couple of weeks. Jenifer
Brandeberry mentioned that with the split legislature chambers it will be
interesting to see what if any kind of budget compromises will happen.
Committee Chair Folska asked Jenifer Brandeberry to send all the Directors
the invitation to the DIA Tour with the Senate Transportation Committee.
Jenifer Brandeberry said that she will send it to the Directors. She noted
that the tour will happen while the APTA Legislative Conference is in
process.
Director Menten asked about the bill the Governor vetoed last year regarding
urban renewal and tax increment financing and if there were any efforts in
resurrecting it. Jenifer Brandeberry replied that a new bill, Senate Bill 123,
is making an attempt to revive the mentioned bill but it is not sufficient for
the proponents of the reform in the urban renewal area. The Speaker of the
House is creating her own bill but it has not been introduced yet. Director
Menten said that it will be interesting to see how Colorado Counties, Inc.
Packet Pg. 19

Jenifer Brandeberry noted that the Legislative Session is halfway through its
season. She said that John Tarbert, Transit Police Chief, is working with the
Colorado Association of Chiefs of Police on a late bill to update and clarify
the police officer statute as it pertains to RTD. He requested the
Brandeberry ~ McKenna team to assist in securing bi-partisan support. The
bill has not been introduced yet. Jenifer Brandeberry thanked Chief Tarbert
for his effort.

(CCI) will react as they probably will not be happy with this outcome. She
requested from Jenifer Brandeberry the contact information for CCI. Jenifer
Brandeberry said she will update the Board when the new bill starts moving.

• Federal Update - Squire Patton Boggs

Committee Chair Folska asked Sherry Ellebracht to read the update sent by
Mike Dino as it was not included in the packet. Sherry Ellebracht asked if a
summary would suffice. Committee Chair Folska said that she preferred
Sherry Ellebracht read the document. Sherry Ellebracht read the document.
A copy of the document is available at the Board Office.

C. Other Matters
Sherry Ellebracht, Government Relations Officer, distributed to the Directors a
packet of information for the APTA Legislative Conference occurring the next week.
She noted the work of Squire Patton Boggs in coordinating the Directors’ visit as
well as having General Manager Phil Washington participate on a Senate Banking
Round Table.
Director Walker said that RTD will host the APTA Transit Board Member and Board
Support Seminar in July. He handed out candy bars with the workshop logo that
will be distributed during the APTA Legislative Conference as a marketing piece.
He noted there will be interesting sessions covering subjects such as: career
pathways and development, Board role in goal setting, CEO hiring process, etc. He
mentioned there will also be tours of different projects throughout the District. He
pointed out that there will be an old style Colorado Ho Down at Coors Field and a
reception at Denver Union Station. Staff is currently looking for sponsors for those
events. He thanked the Board Office Staff for their hard work. Committee Chair
Folska said that it is great RTD is hosting the Workshop.
Marla Lien, General Counsel, said that the Court ruled in favor of RTD on House bill
131272: sales tax parity bill. It is up to the plaintiffs to appeal the decision once
again. Director Hoy asked if RTD had implemented the bill already. Marla Lien
replied that it has been implemented and if the court ruled against RTD it would
mean that the Agency would have to issue refunds.

Sherry Ellebracht, Government Relations Officer, noted that Mike Dino from
Squire Patton Boggs, is in Washington, D.C. preparing for the Directors’
attendance to the APTA Legislative Conference next week. She forwarded
his update via email to the Directors. Sherry Ellebracht mentioned that that
morning the House of Representatives did pass a clean immigration bill and
the President said that he would sign it. This will fund Homeland Security
through September 30th.

B. Updates

• Transit Oriented Communities (TOC) Update
Bill Sirois, Senior Manager for Transit Oriented Communities (TOC), reviewed
the TOC Update presentation included in the Planning and Development
meeting agenda packet for March 3, 2015. The presentation included
updates on the Civic Center Transit District Plan, Title VI Equity Analyses,
First and Final Mile to Transit, the University of Denver Garage Retail, the
Welton Corridor Pilot, Transit Oriented Development (TOD) Functional
Assessment, Real Property Unsolicited Proposal Policy, Value Capture,
Alameda Pilot Station, Olde Town Pilot, Federal Center Pilot, Depot Square,
and Station Area Master Plans.
Bill Sirois noted that the department’s name has been officially changed from
TOD to TOC. He mentioned that he was not planning on going into details
for the Alameda Pilot Station, Olde Town Pilot, Federal Center Pilot, Depot
Square, and Station Area Master Plans but would be happy to answer any
questions on those.
Committee Chair James expressed his appreciation for the work on the TOD
assessment.
Director Folska thanked Bill Sirois for the comprehensive review. She asked
Bill Sirois to read the complete slide on Value Review as well as the slides on
the Alameda Pilot Station, Old Towne Pilot, Federal Center Pilot, Depot
Square, and Station Area Master Plans. Bill Sirois read the requested slides.
Director Folska thanked Bill Sirois for reading the slides.

Directors Archuleta and Lasater participated via remote.

Director Francone asked how unsolicited proposals are currently handled.
Bill Sirois said that they are handled on a case by case basis following
Resolution #10 from 1984. Committee Chair James added that the pilot
program started about a year ago is examining different methodologies for
real property disposition. Bill Sirois mentioned that Susan Altes, Senior
Manager for Property will have a report in the near future. This report will
take lessons learned into account.
Director Lubow noted that it seemed logical to wait for input from the TOD
Assessment consultant to finalize the unsolicited proposal policy. Bill Sirois
stated that that is staff’s plan. He hopes to have an update for the Board in
May.
Director Walker mentioned that he has read a lot about density criticism;
however, those projects are not at transfer centers but mostly at off the side
stations. He asked Bill Sirois if he has seen any resistance to TOC projects.
Bill Sirois replied that the City and County of Denver has embraced TOCs.
Jurisdictions outside of Denver vary on their support. He said that most
communities have been accepting during the planning process. It is when
the specifics of how many potential people will live in a certain area is
addressed that people get a bit upset.
Director Bagley noted that he toured Depot Square with Chair Sisk last
week. He did so in order to understand some of the challenges he has read
in the Denver Post regarding density and height. He said that he was very
impressed with the progress at it is at 95% complete. The property is
centrally located. He mentioned that all buildings in the area are at a 5 story
level. He encouraged the Directors to go visit soon as the location opens in
about 3 months. Committee Chair James thanked Director Bagley for
illustrating the catalyst RTD is to development in the Metro area. Committee
Chair James mentioned that some areas are perceived to be too dense (like
Cherry Creek and 32nd and Lowell). These areas, he said, need to be
examined on a case by case basis.
Director Menten asked how far $150,000 - $250,000 would go on the
University Garage project. Bill Sirois said that his team is having this
conversation with the Financial Department. Director Menten asked if there
would be an update for the Board prior to the release of the Request for
Proposal (RFP). Bill Sirois said that yes, an update will be given.
Packet Pg. 24

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 3, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Folska expressed her confusion about unsolicited proposals versus
sole source. Bill Sirois explained that RTD’s current unsolicited proposal
policy excludes real property. He noted that the policy that is being worked
on will address when sole source opportunity would be appropriate for real
estate.

6.D

Director Menten recalled that the space at the University garage seemed to
be tight causing her to have a hard time picturing where there is room for
new parking spaces. She mentioned that old minutes point out there was a
plan for diagonal parking but the City and County of Denver had an opinion
on that idea. Bill Sirois explained that the first level ramp has space for 2526 head in parking spaces. There will also be loading zone space for retail.
Regarding angled parking, Bill Sirois noted that it was a proposal for the
street parking but the City and County of Denver has the final decision as
they own the right of way. They did not support angled parking.
Director Menten wondered if the business utilizing the retail space would
have a say on what RTD is doing inside the garage. Bill Sirois said that
retailers will have requirements into what goes into the retail space but not
the garage. Director Menten asked for an update at the April meeting. Bill
Sirois replied that he will provide any updates available at the time.
Chair Sisk thanked Director Bagley for his visit to Depot Square and showing
a regional approach. Chair Sisk said that Director Menten asked some of the
questions he had as well. He wondered if the formal name of the parking
garage is the University garage. Bill Sirois said that the light rail station’s
name is University of Denver, so the parking is using that name as well.
Chair Sisk expressed his concern that some students are using the parking
lot as if it were property of the University of Denver. He encouraged staff to
have a much wider discussion and plan that would make sense for retail,
commuters, and enforcement issues. He reminded staff and the Directors
that commuters that used that Park-n-Ride have come to Board meetings to
express their concern. Chair Sisk said that RTD owes it to its constituents
to make a full review of that area and looks forward to seeing a full scale
analysis.
Director Menten asked Bill Sirois to review the three options being proposed
by the City and County of Denver and RTD for the Welton property. Bill
Sirois said that the three options were affordable housing opportunities, for
sale housing, and retail to support community goals. Director Menten said
that even though the property is in the middle of Downtown, she would
prefer to see higher paying jobs in the area, such as manufacturing or
Packet Pg. 25

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 3, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Menten asked about the RFP process in 2012 and 2014. Bill Sirois
clarified that no RFP was issued after 2012. After the 2012 RFP, his
department engaged other commercial real estate experts to get a better
handle on the property and qualities of the RFP. Director Menten wondered
if his department would be able to give a better idea of what RTD would get
for the investment during the April meeting. Bill Sirois replied that his team
can only guess an estimate until we start getting proposals. He noted that
an initial investment of $500,000 - $700,000 would return about 3 times
over a 7 year period.

6.D

Committee Chair James thanked both Bill Sirois and Bill Van Meter for the
compilation of articles on the increase of value around light rail stations. He
said this puts the role of the TOC Department into perspective. He
mentioned RTD’s role is to move people and the TOC Department has the
opportunity to increase the liveability of a community. He pointed out that
this is consistent with RTD’s mission statement.
Director Folska asked Bill Sirois if he had heard of Galvanize Denver. Bill
Sirois said that he had. She noted that RTD could perhaps create those
kinds of opportunities (education, community focus, and venture capital) for
smaller business areas.
Director Anderson noted that it is great that RTD can work with
communities to add value. She reminded the Board that the cities and
counties are the ones that are land use planners. They have comprehensive
plans. It is great that RTD can cooperate with the municipalities as long as
RTD remembers its role in the process.
General Manager Phil Washington said that RTD is in a very unique position
in the Denver Metro region as we are transforming the region through transit
infrastructure investment. He said that as APTA Chair he has been talking
about gentrification around the country. He noted that we celebrate TOC
but we also have to be aware that this has been pushing the transit
dependent out of the urban core. Many of the TOC projects do not include
affordable housing. Removing the transit dependent from the employment
core is forcing us to provide transit outside the of the transit core. The
transit dependent have come to meetings saying that they cannot afford to
pay the fares. RTD has been extending services in order to provide transit
to the displaced which increases RTD’s costs. Phil Washington said that he
was mentioning this to the Directors as food for thought. Committee Chair
James added that RTD is an important part of society but not all of it.

C. Other Matters
No other matters were presented.

hospital equipment. She said that higher wages mean more money for the
community and retail wages are not going to provide for a family. Bill Sirois
said that the property is 18,000 square feet and would be more suitable to
an office component on the ground floor and residential projects above. He
said that the area is also in historic preservation. He noted that he could
speak to the City and County of Denver about other options even when
those options are not consistent with the current plan. Director Menten said
that she would like to continue the conversation offline.

thanked them for their interest in the future of RTD. He then announced his GM Executive
Search Committee: Chair Sisk as Chair of this committee, Director Bagley, Director
Deadwyler, Director Francone and Director Tobiassen.
Director Menten inquired as to how he chose these members. Chair Sisk stated he had
done quite a bit of soul searching as to who would be the best members to represent the
interest of the Board and agency. He was looking for diversity in terms of senior members
who were part of the 2010 transition committee and could provide a historical
perspective, new Board members who could provide an infusion of fresh ideas, and
diversity of thoughts and ideas.
Director Tobiassen thanked the Chair for the opportunity to serve on this committee. He

this committee. He plans to use his vacation and other time to be present. He is
committed to open communications with the full Board.
Director Solano expressed that the former General Manager before GM Washington was
overpaid. He stated it is time for a change. We need new standards for pay. He stated no
good leader would lead the troops on a hill and desert them. This is a slippery slope.

Director Lasater inquired as to the interim General Manager and permanent General
Manager role. Is this clearly defined and who will define this. Chair Sisk indicated that
once the GM Executive Search team is identified, they will work the process for this;
however, it is clearly expected that the full Board will have input. We will utilize a buddy
system and ultimately any decision will come before the full Board for approval.
Director Bagley shared that there were three Board members who are still on the Board
when the transition occurred in 2009. He noted this is a very intensive, laborious process
of love. He recalls easily working 50 hours per week on this Committee.
Director Solano stated his credentials and previous experience in working with an attorney
on employment issues; he just wants to do a good job. He raised the issue of why no
Latino was on this committee. He stated the Latino population represents about 57% of
the population and should have a strong voice in this selection process.
Chair Sisk noted that RTD is a very successful agency and we cannot lose sight of our
fiduciary responsibilities. He believes this is an opportunity for the Board to come together
in unison and cooperation.

III.

Review of Transition Process Policy
Paula Perdue provided a high-level view of the most important key decision points of the
Board/GM Executive Search Committee over the coming months as documented in the
BOD process for hiring/transitioning to a new General Manager. She noted that in 2010,
no such document exists so this document followed the process that had been created
and successfully executed. Some of these key decision points included:
 Appointment of Transition Committee
 Selection of Interim GM
 Signature replacement/authorization on agency checks
 Review of GM Payout (salary, vacation time, sick time, pension) and a review
performed by independent audit Rubin Brown. This requires approval from the
Chair

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 17, 2015 3:00 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Lubow inquired about who would be the Chair. Chair Sisk indicated he will act as
Chair. Director Lubow expressed some concerns as to how the full Board can have input.

 Determine communication strategy for employees/stakeholders/elected officials
 Review Board approved compensation philosophy
 Hire strategic advisory service
 Build project workplan and schedules/timelines
 Hire outside legal service/employment law
 Hire benchmarking firm for full benchmarking (if needed)
 Review of Job Description/establish of candidate profile
 Selection of Civic leader panel
 Interview process
 Public/stakeholder forum or reception
 Selection of GM
Paula emphasized the importance of transparency and open communications throughout
this process. She especially emphasized the importance of confidentiality for candidates
or potential applicants. The Colorado Statute defines when a candidate becomes a finalist
and when names can be released. The Board will need to strike a balance on the need to
know and the protection of the candidate confidentiality.
General Counsel Marla Lien referenced some of the legal concerns related to Open
meetings/open records and the procurement process. She indicated that we will work
through Brian Iacono organization, procurement, to make sure we follow the proper
procurement process. The RFPs for national search firm, outside legal services or other
management services will be handled by procurement.
Board members need to also understand what constitutes a meeting. Electronic chatter
could be classified as a meeting if more than two people are involved. Also, Board
members should use their RTD accounts for any electronic communications.
Relative to the code of ethics, we will follow a fair and open process. Board members and
staff can be expected to be solicited and lobbied on all levels. Board members will need to
refer these types of inquiries to our procurement department to avoid any perception of
code violation.
Director Lasater inquired if we have any estimates of cost for this based on the 2009
transition process. Paula Perdue indicated she will try to research and compile.
Director Folska asked for a clarification between what constitutes lobbying and just being
fair. Marla Lien used the example of lobbying as it relates to job related issues; Board
members negotiating with firms or vendors or individuals rather than having all interested
party in the same room receiving the same and consistent information. The use of names
or references sometimes can create a problem.

Director Menten referenced different sections in the document and asked for more
explanation. She also inquired about the ability to do her own personal investigation of
candidates. Marla Lien stated that within the process, we will have various ways to get
information; however, we cautioned that there has to be a balance between the request
for confidentiality and Board members going off on their own. Chair Sisk shared the
example in Washington where because of a confidentiality leak, all of the candidates
withdrew from the job and they had to start over. This adds tremendous delay, costs and
affects the ability/credibility of the agency.
Director Lubow expressed concern that the document is just a guideline and not written in
stone. She does not feel this process absolves her from her responsibility to the transition
process. She thinks the benchmarking will be important and she would like this team to
come back to the full Board for guidance. Director Menten dittoed similar sentiments.
Director Anderson expressed that all of the Board members are concerned but not all can
be on the transition team. She believes this is a great effort and the Buddy system should
work. What is also important is confidentiality. Board members will have a chance to
participate throughout the process and can make a list of what is important to them for a
GM. Chair Sisk elaborated that the ultimate selection will be by a vote of the full Board.
Director James indicated he was pleased with the process. He sees this almost as a
matchmaking process. If we follow the rules, the process will work better. It is also
important to remember that relevant to the interviewing process, we are interviewing
candidates but they are also interviewing us. We need to be on our best behavior.
Director Lasater shared he has participated on three hiring processes in the city of Parker.
The process we are following is very similar to the process used by Parker and he is
comfortable with it. It is important that our process is inclusive of staff, citizens,
stakeholders, communities and others. The Buddy system is a good channel to make sure
the full Board is informed. At the end of the day, the full Board selects the interim General
Manager and permanent General Manager.

IV.

Advice from Legal Counsel and Executive Session and Procurement
Marla Lien provided legal counsel relative to going into Executive Session. She stated that
executive session has to be only for the purpose as stated on the C.R.S.; that no voting is
allowed in Executive Session and that the reason why the Board can go into Executive
Session for interim GM is because names will be discussed. She stated that the
discussion could be about the options for interim General Manager. If the Board chooses

Director Bagley re-emphasized the importance of confidentiality. When in doubt, just don’t
do it.

6.E

to select a name, they must come out of Executive Session, the Executive Committee can
make a motion and the full Board would approve in the upcoming Board meeting. If they
decide on a process, the Executive decision can determine that and no action would be
required.

B. Recommended Actions

• Request for Increase to SmartCard Contract and Budget Transfer
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to
increase the Xerox Transport Solutions contract not-to-exceed amount by
$1,300,000 to a new contract amount not-to-exceed $21,031,382 and to
authorize a budget transfer of up to $3,800,000 to fund activities under
this contract.
Motion:

Director Bagley made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the March 24, 2015
Board Meeting.
Director Lasater seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Doug MacLeod, Acting Chief Financial Officer (CFO),
introduced Kim Heldman, Senior Manager of Information
Technology (IT), and George Hovey, Manager of IT Program
Management.
Doug MacLeod explained that the recommended action
comprises two actions: expanding the scope of the SmartCard
contract and a budget transfer to fund the contract.
Expanding the contract would include adding bus validators for
Call-n-Ride vehicles and SmartCard hosting. He reminded the
Directors that in October, 2014, the Board approved an
Packet Pg. 34

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 17, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Solano left the meeting early.

6.F

Director Folska asked if there were any legal implications in
using COP funds. She also wondered where the funds for mall
shuttles would come from when needed. Doug MacLeod
replied that COP funds are allowed to be transferred to a
similar lifespan item with bond counsel approval. He noted
that when a vendor could provide mall shuttles that funding
piece would be rolled to the most current COP at that time.
Director Lasater asked if Xerox is Payment Card Industry (PCI)
Data Security Standard compliant. Kim Heldman replied that
an audit to review PCI and other security requirements will
begin on Monday, March 23, 2015. Director Lasater said that
the security question needs to be in the forefront of the
conversation. He added that Xerox either is or is not PCI
compliant. He named General Electric as an example of not
being able to handle security requirements. Director Lasater
expressed his concern on how a security breach would impact
our customers. George Hovey said that IT staff shares
Director Lasater’s concern. George Hovey named this concern
as one of the reasons why RTD is still hosting the current
SmartCards. He noted that moving to a debit card system
raises cyber security issues. Staff has selected a third party to
confirm RTD is doing its fiduciary responsibility. George
Hovey said that staff had more information during the
SmartCard update later in the meeting. Director Lasater
wondered if there was a fall back plan. George Hovey said
that the three options are: continuing with the current
SmartCard system, using Xerox for the SmartCards, or
engaging another company in case of a problem with Xerox.
Director Solano noted that it does not make sense to address
SmartCards when RTD does not have real time information
yet.
Director Francone asked how long the audit would last.
George Hovey replied that the first audit round should be
completed by the end of May. By then his team would have a
list of shortcomings, vulnerabilities, and checklists addressing
Packet Pg. 35

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 17, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

increase in the Xerox contract to include new work items.
Staff is now requesting authorization to fund those items
through a budget transfer from the issuance of Certificates of
Participation (COPs) which proceeds are not currently needed
for their original intent, such as the purchase of Mall Shuttles.
These transfers would have no impact on the 2015 amended
budget.

6.F

Director Solano mentioned that he is partially deaf and that he
does not comprehend the conversation. He asked to meet
with staff offline.
Chair Sisk said that the Directors want to move to a more
comprehensive SmartCard system soon. He pointed out that
$500,000 is required for web hosting. He wondered why we
needed a web host and when did staff become aware of this
information. George Hovey replied that RTD hosts the current
system. Throughout the due diligence process it became
apparent that RTD does not have the capacity to host a debit
card system. The web hosting piece has been in negotiations
with Xerox for some time. Chair Sisk clarified that it sounded
like staff did not anticipate outside web hosting but it having
Xerox host is a more secure way for our customers. George
Hovey agreed.
Committee Chair Tobiassen thanked Director Lasater for his
cyber security concerns. He commended RTD for hiring Sheri
Le, Manager for Cyber Security. He noted that she has been
working on this project to ensure its security.
Director Deadwyler mentioned that the Directors have been
approving additional adjustments at various time. She asked if
there was an implementation date in sight as it seemed that
the plans were behind schedule. Doug MacLeod reminded the
Directors that the current SmartCards were introduced in
2013. The plan is to implement stored value cards by the end
of 2015 and passes by the beginning of 2016. The items
presented today are the final items for approval. He said that
there would be more information during the SmartCard update
later in the meeting.

Packet Pg. 36

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 17, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

issues as needed. He added that cyber security is a continuing
process. Director Francone reiterated Director Lasater’s
question: would RTD have to start anew with a new vendor if
Xerox fails. George Hovey replied that staff is moving ahead
with all three options as the schedule is very aggressive.
Director Francone wondered how the cost of utilizing another
company would compare to Xerox. George Hovey replied that
the cost would be less as RTD would then be doing more work
in house.

Lasater, Lubow, Sisk, Tobiassen, Walker
NAYS: Tina Francone, Natalie Menten, Paul Solano
Committee Chair Tobiassen declared the motion PASSED.

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to
execute a budget transfer in an amount up to $1,900,000 from the Mall
Shuttle project in order to purchase and install the equipment necessary to
accommodate the sale of fare media under the proposed fare structure.
Motion:

Director Anderson made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the March 24, 2015
Board Meeting.
Director Walker seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Doug MacLeod, Acting CFO, noted that the thermal printers
would add a convenience to the customers when buying daily
passes. Staff is seeking Board approval to initiate the Request
for Proposal (RFP) process. He noted that this item would not
move forward if the new Fare Structure was not approved.
Staff is starting the request for authorization now in order to
have time for implementation by 2016.
Director Folska said she would vote no as she did not
understand why the budget transfer needed to happen today.
Committee Chair Tobiassen asked Doug MacLeod to comment
on the timeline. Doug MacLeod noted that public hearings are
happening in the next few weeks. The plan is to come back
to the Board in April or May with the Fare Structure proposal.
Doug MacLeod noted that approval of the recommended
action would mean an accounting transfer. If the Fare
Structure is not approved the money would be transferred
back. Director Folska wondered if there would be a test
period before implementing on all buses. Doug MacLeod
replied that staff sent a team to study TriMet’s system in
Portland, OR. This team came back with great ideas.
Director Menten noted from the discussion on the previous
recommended action that Certificate of Participation’s (COP)
Packet Pg. 37

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 17, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

• Authorization to execute a budget transfer to purchase thermal printers

transfers must be for a similar lifespan item. She asked staff if
printers would last 12 years. Doug MacLeod replied that
TriMet installed their printers 2 years ago and they have not
had any problems so far. He noted that the lifespan should
not be an issue as the printers would be replaced when buses
are replaced. Director Menten expressed her concerns about
thermal receipts turning dark if left in the sun and getting
smudged if crumpled. George Hovey, Manager for IT Program
Management, addressed those concerns noting that TriMet
recommends not installing the printers near heating vents. He
noted that TriMet prints tickets valid for over 24 hours and
ticket deterioration is not an issue.
Director Lasater said that he will be voting no. He noted that
if he was part of the bond counsel he would reject the request
to use the funds for thermal printers as they do not have a 12
year life expectancy. Doug MacLeod replied that the bond
counsel was taken into consideration when these types of
requests are made. He added that RTD has paid a large
amount of the principal. The bond counsel would take the
payment into consideration and not have collaterals be a great
issue.
Director Walker said that he would vote yes since the
purchase of the thermal printers would take place assuming
fare structure approval. He noted that he did not want to
have a new fare structure and not be able to provide the
services promised. He mentioned that the bond counsel would
decide if it is an appropriate use of funds.
Director Solano said he would vote no due to staff’s track
record of putting the cart before the horse.
Committee Chair Tobiassen echoed Director Walker’s
comments, noting the risk of not being able to provide a
service that was promised. He pointed out that there were
not many alternatives to provide day passes to customers on
buses. He calculated that it would cost $6 a day for the life
of the device in 1,000 buses to provide this service to
customers.
Director Lasater said that the Mall Shuttle COPs are not the
appropriate area to transfer funds for thermal printers. He
noted that staff could find $1.9 million from another sources.

Director Lubow mentioned that she had some concerns since
moving forward with the thermal printers depended on the
Board’s approval of the Fare Structure. She asked if there
was another way of funding the printers since some Directors
felt the COP was an inappropriate source of funding. Doug
MacLeod replied that at the moment there is not $1.9 million
available. Not using the COP would mean taking the money
from another project. He said that the COP is RTD’s best
financial option as the agency is paying interest on the COP
funds. Director Lubow asked why the bond counsel was not
consulted before coming to the Board. Doug MacLeod replied
that staff wanted to have authorization from the Board before
engaging in the cost of bond review.
Director Hoy noted that the Board seems enthusiastic about
day passes. If day passes are approved RTD will need a way
to provide those passes. He added that he likes that the
thermal printers are working in other agencies. He also noted
his preference of the printed material not having a long life
expectancy as it should only be valid for a day.
Director Solano said that we should get back to basics and fix
the 16th Street Mall and its tiles, which are injury prone, before
investing in thermal printers.
Director James noted how utilizing the COP funding may seem
like endangering the financing of the 16th St. Mall. He
mentioned that he did not feel the need to speak but due to all
the negative feedback he wanted to add his support of the
recommended action.
Director Solano mentioned that he was talking about the tiles
on the 16th Street Mall. Director Anderson called for a point of
order. Committee Chair Tobiassen called for the vote.

Packet Pg. 39

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 17, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Anderson noted that staff would present the transfer
to the bond counsel before doing the transfer itself. She
mentioned that from staff’s report and presentation, RTD will
not need Mall Shuttle funding until 2016. She said that she
will vote yes as this is a good way to serve our passengers
and we will not need the funds for the buses until later next
year. She added that the manner in which the funds would be
accessible is an acceptable accounting procedure in any
organization.

C. Updates
Kim Heldman, Senior Manager for IT, reviewed the SmartCard Project
Update included in the Financial Administration and Audit Committee
meeting packet for March 17, 2015. The update included the status, prior
period activities, and next period activities for 14 elements of the process.
She highlighted the following elements:
 Stored Value Card – staff has been working with Xerox to coordinate
activities and gain commitments to meet remaining activities through
this year. The target live date is November 1st, 2015.
 New Fare Structure – staff is moving forward with timely decisions in
order to meet deadlines. Target date is January 1st, 2016.
 Merchant Retail Point of Sales (POS) – This is the one element that
has a yellow status due to the holiday season timeframe and
Safeway in negotiations with Albertsons. Target date is October 1st.
Director Bagley mentioned that what RTD has done with SmartCards in a
controlled environment has been a great first step. He said that he is aware
that SmartCards have been in use in a lot of places; however, most of those
experiences have proven that the technology was released too quickly.
Director Bagley expressed his excitement to see most elements green on the
Board Report. He agreed with staff that the company merger of Safeway
and Albertsons is problematic. He thanked staff for a job well done and not
putting out a product that does not work.
Director Solano expressed his gratitude to staff for their work on this
project.
Director Lasater wondered if staff had looked into integrating the RTD
SmartCard program into existing POS retail locations. He said that counter
space is at a premium and companies may look favorably into using one POS
for multiple uses since it would not require adopting another technology.
George Hovey, Manager for IT Program Management, replied that in
conversations with retailers the general consensus was resistance against
integrating their system and networks with ours. George Hovey recognized

• SmartCard Project Update

6.F

Director Lubow thanked staff for their work on this very complex project.
She expressed her concern over the tight schedule since there are so many
dependencies we do not have control over. She asked staff what Plan B
would be and what would be the consequences of adopting a second plan.
Kim Heldman thanked Director Lubow for recognizing the complexity of the
project. Kim Heldman said that Plan B would be unfolding the program
during the 1st quarter of 2016. She explained that the main consequence
would be not having the product available for the general public at the
timeframe that has been expected.
Director Archuleta wondered if the web portal would function like event web
portals, where customers could buy a ticket, print it out at home, and use
over the next 24 hours. Kim Heldman clarified that customers will be able
to purchase and reload the card via the web portal. They would be able to
use the card to purchase tickets.
Director Francone expressed her gratitude to staff for their work on the
project. She inquired about the November 1, 2015 release date and if it
would be under the current fare structure. She also asked if staff has been
overseeing the web portal project. Kim Heldman recognized the hard work
her team has put into the project. She replied that the November 1st release
date will be under the current fare structure. If and when the Board
approves a new fare structure, staff will then make the adjustments
necessary to provide the services needed using the SmartCard technology.
Kim Heldman also noted that her team has been working very closely with
Xerox overseeing the web portal project.
Director Folska thanked staff for their work. She asked staff to help her
visualize the ADA component of the project. George Hovey said that the
web portal will be ADA accessible as it will be through the RTD website.
Staff completed an audit with Xerox and made some modifications. He
noted that staff has been working with the National Federation of the Blind
in Colorado and have modified the validators in order to make them more
accessible. Director Folska noted that the current validators require sight in
order to enable the voice activation. She wondered if this was true for the
new components. George Hovey said that he would look into this and will
have an answer at the next meeting.
Director Deadwyler thanked staff for all their work. She wondered what the
cost of just getting the card will be and how it would affect those with low
income. Doug MacLeod said that staff has had initial conversations about
the card cost. The original recommendation was giving it for free. He said
that currently the cards cost $1.25 to manufacture. The new vendor will
Packet Pg. 41

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 17, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

that technology is moving that direction; however the retailers do not seem
to be responsive to that technology yet.

6.F

manufacture them at $1.12. Staff is still discussing what would be a good
incentive to keep the card while taking into consideration that some people
will not have the ability to purchase them.

Director Menten inquired if the SmartCard would be rigid like a credit card or
flexible like some gift cards. She also expressed her surprise at the
manufacturing cost and the problem of just using a card once. Doug
MacLeod replied that the cards would be rigid as they have a chip inside.
The more flexible kind with a magnetic strip posed many security concerns.
Director Menten noted that there are kiosks in Lakewood were riders can go
and look up route information. She wondered if they are meant to be
informational machines or could they have the capacity to generate a card
out of a slot. George Hovey replied that the kiosks are informational. He
said staff has reviewed different options, including the longevity of the
current kiosks.

• Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Update (Leeds School of Business)
Doug MacLeod, Acting CFO, introduced Robert McNown and Brian
Lewandowski from the CU Leeds School of Business. They reviewed the
RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model presentation as included in the
Financial Administration and Audit Committee agenda packet for March 17,
2015. The presentation covered the model development; economic drivers;
uncertainty; forecasts and revisions; and the comparison with the Colorado
Legislative Council and the Office of State Planning and Budgeting. Robert
McNown noted that the forecast includes Moody’s Analytics as they are
well respected by many firms.
Director Bagley reminded the Directors that in 2011 the Fiscal Sustainability
Task Force requested a third party Sales and Use Tax forecast. He
mentioned former Director John Tayer as one of the major proposers of the
task force. Director Bagley noted that the fact that the forecast has been on
the conservative end means that RTD is doing better than expected. He
applauded the work of the Leeds School of Business as it has helped RTD
have better communication with stakeholders, customers, and tax payers.
Director Folska echoed Director Bagley’s sentiment. She appreciates that
the Leeds School of Business is from the University of Colorado, her Alma
Mater. She asked Brian Lewandowski to remind the Directors what the term
and value of the contract with the Leeds School of Business is as well as
other entities that they work with. Brian Lewandowski replied that the
Packet Pg. 42

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 17, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Tobiassen expressed his gratitude for the scope of the project and
the many variables out of staff’s control. He wondered what the
consequences would be if the Board did not approve the proposed fare
structured. He said that staff could answer that question later.

Director Folska recalled that while at the APTA Legislative Conference, a
speaker mentioned that rail transportation to downtown from the airport has
resulted in an 11-12% spike in revenue for most areas. She wondered if this
value could be added to the forecast utilizing data from other cities. Robert
McNown replied that the forecast utilizes historical data and thus it would be
difficult to add new information. As data becomes available it could be
incorporated into the forecast. He added that maybe his team could be
more creative in incorporating these types of changes. Brian Lewandowski
added that there are some models that could be use which quantify
expanding traffic systems, such as the Regional Economic Models, Inc.
(REMI). Director Folska mentioned that hard numbers of predictable funding
sources help the Directors in making their case when asking for Federal
sources of funding.
Director Hoy noted the mention of the marijuana revenue, both for medicinal
and recreational, is at 1%. He asked what that 1% was from. Robert
McNown said that the 1% of RTD’s Sales and Use Tax Revenue is from
marijuana. Director Hoy asked if Leeds has measured the impact of RTD
having parity with the State on taxes. Brian Lewandowski replied that the
specifics of the parity cannot be quantified because the State gets the
revenue from retailers in general categories, not item by item.
Director Bagley addressed Director Folska’s suggestion. He noted that it is
very difficult to get the details of the fine grain economic analysis on a
macro level. Robert McNown agreed that it is really quite a challenge with
so many variables. He added that the REMI model Brian Lewandowski
referred to uses different methodology and strategy to make assumptions on
impacts, in this case, to RTD revenue.

• 2015 Amended Budget, 2016-2021 SBP, 2016 Budget - Calendar
Jannette Scarpino, Manager of Budget and Financial Analysis, referred the
Directors to the 2015 Summary SBP/Budget Calendar included in the
Financial Administration and Audit Committee meeting agenda packet for
March 17, 2015. She highlighted the following dates:
 April 14 – 2016-2021 SBP and 2016 budget development process

• Fourth Quarter 2014 Performance Measures

Director Lubow expressed her concern over the recent light rail accidents.
She noted that even when RTD is not at fault the agency is the one that
looks bad. Jannette Scarpino replied that of the few incidents in the Fourth
Quarter 2014, only one was a preventable accident. Phil Washington,
General Manager, agreed with Director Lubow. He said that RTD has upped
our safety programs; RTD is working with police departments on educational
programs and doing all we can. He said that one preventable accident is too
much.
Director Menten asked what “Info Rides” are, as referenced in Goal 7.1.
Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager for Communications, replied that
these are events when RTD takes a bus to schools or other civic events at
which people are shown how to ride. Director Menten asked if educating
people how to use Access-a-Ride and other services fall under this category.
Scott Reed explained that Easter Seals does that kind of service in
collaboration with Via Mobility. Info Rides are targeted to people not familiar
with RTD. Director Menten wondered if rail safety would be under civic
events. Scott Reed replied that operations safety is not included in the
performance measures but staff has that information available.
Director Hoy addressed the preventable and non-preventable accidents from
his transportation background. He noted that when an accident is nonpreventable it is not a matter of guilty or not guilty. He added that the
record of only one preventable accident is incredibly good.

• January 2015 KPI Dashboard
Doug MacLeod, Acting CFO, presented the January 2015 Key Performance
Indicators as included in the Financial Administration and Audit Committee
meeting agenda packet for March 17, 2015. He noted that ridership was
down 2.3%, revenue was down at 1.1%, and Sales and Use Tax was up
10.8%.
Director Bagley mentioned that there has been a 50% reduction in the cost
of oil and gasoline. He said his prediction is that if the reduction stays under
$60 we could expect to see lower ridership and revenue all year long. He

said that we would have to depend on higher Sales and Use Tax revenue in
order to have a balanced budget.

Jannette Scarpino, Manager of Budget and Financial Analysis, referred the
Directors to the Fiscal Sustainability Task Force Recommendations Update
included in the Financial Administration and Audit Committee meeting
agenda packet for March 17, 2015. She highlighted the following areas:
 Fund Balance Policy – the target is $90 million; it is currently at
$35.8 million
 Technology and Energy Innovation – we are now able to quantify our
savings: average of $3,000 a month at East Metro and $500 a month
in Boulder due to lighting upgrades.
 Sales and Use Tax Compliance Reviews – 15 reviews are being
scheduled, 52 reviews are ongoing, and 8 are complete.
 Naming Rights – IMG has been meeting with potential partners. Any
proposed naming rights/corporate sponsorship contract will be
brought to the RTD Board for approval.
Director Folska asked the Directors and staff to think about what the Board
can do to fill the gap in the Fund Balance. Doug MacLeod noted that the
accounting balance for the fund balance is $75 million liability in our books.
He said that $68 million is for the represented fund and $7 million pension
trust for the salary employees. Staff position’s is that our obligation is what
is in the Collective Bargaining Agreement, not the accounting entry. Janette
Scarpino said that this could be clarified for future reports.

D. Other Matters
Chair Sisk noted that the Executive Committee met at 3:00 p.m. that afternoon and
all 15 Directors attended the meeting. He said that he appointed a General
Manager Executive Search Committee. The members are Directors Deadwyler,
Bagley, Sisk, Tobiassen, and Francone. The committee will focus on transparency,
communication, and documentation. He said the buddy system will ensure
communication and input from all Board members. The Directors are confident that
the agency is on solid ground. The Board is moving forward on a structured pace
to accept interim applications. Chair Sisk added that while he accepted General
Manager Phil Washington’s resignation reluctantly, he also congratulated him on his
new position at L.A. Metro. Chair Sisk said that RTD owes it to the constituents
and elected officials to keep an eye on the many balls in the air.

B. Recommended Actions
There were no recommended actions.

C. Updates

• Fare Study Update
Lacy Bell, Planning Project Manager, reminded the Board that public hearings
were scheduled to start next week. She reviewed a Power Point
presentation that is available in the March 17, 2015 Operations and
Customer Service Committee Agenda Packet.
Lacy Bell recapped the staff recommendation of passengers paying per
boarding with a 2x day pass. This recommendation would also eliminate rail
zones and have fares based on the type of service (local/rail, express,
regional, and airport). She said that the fare levels included in the
recommendation meet the Strategic Budget Plan revenue targets necessary
to maintain planned service levels.
Lacy Bell outlined that there would be one public hearing in each District,
with an additional hearing at the Blake offices. Spanish translation will be
provided at all hearings. She said these were advertised on-board RTD
vehicles, in print news media and online, both in English and Spanish. Lacy
Bell noted that there are other opportunities for comment. There is a phone
line, online comment form and survey that people may use who cannot

Lacy Bell stated that the next steps are:
 Final Staff Recommendation for Board Approval
o Target: April 14 Operations and Customer Service Committee
 Title VI Equity Analysis
o Equity analysis is underway for the current staff
recommendation
o Summary of the results will be presented to FTA and the
Board
 Begin Phase 3: Pass Program Evaluation
o Determine opportunities for improvement of non-profit agency
low income program
o Develop action plan for pricing Eco and College Pass on smart
card utilization data
She noted that this is an aggressive timeline with the Title VI Equity Analysis
and Phase 3 beginning simultaneously with the public hearings.
Tony McCaulay, Senior Manager of Marketing, explained that in the current
Non-Profit Agency Reduced Fare Program:
 RTD works with over 200 non-profit agencies to offer free and
reduced fares to low income individuals including the working poor
 Agencies are responsible for verifying individual income eligibility and
distributing fare media
 RTD provides 10-Ride Ticketbooks or monthly passes to non-profits
for a discount (25%-60%)
 Maximum amount participating individuals pay is 50%
 $5.8 million in fare media provided in 2014
o RTD subsidized $2.5 million
Tony McCaulay pointed out that there are opportunities for improvement in
the program. He said that the fare study goals for the Non-Profit Agency
Program are to improve access, simplifying the program and streamline the
administrative processes. Staff plans to continue outreach within the nonprofit community to have recommendations by July, 2015, for
implementation in early 2016.
General Manager Washington stated that staff has received a great deal of
input up to this point and we are still in the comment period. He reiterated
that staff has made a recommendation but it is not the final recommendation
that will be brought to the Board for approval.

attend one of the public hearings. These options were also advertised onboard RTD vehicles.

6.G

Director Folska asked Tony McCaulay to explain the various discounts
offered. Tony McCaulay stated that there are three aspects of the program.
Agencies can purchase 10-ride ticketbooks for a 60% discount or monthly
local passes at a 40% discount. For both of these options the agency must
provide the tickets or passes at no cost to their clients. The third program is
available on all monthly passes. Those are purchased at a 25% discount
and the agency can recover up to 50% of the cost of the passes from their
clients. He said that staff is finding from the survey results that not many
agencies are recouping any cost from the clients.
Committee Chair Anderson requested staff prepare a one sheet outline of
the program to be distributed to the Board. Tony McCaulay said that he
would provide it as soon as it was finished.
Director Walker inquired if staff had been in contact with King County
Transit as they have implemented a low income fare program. Scott Reed,
Assistant General Manager of Communications, said that staff had not been
in director contact but had been following the program, specifically the
financial impacts. General Manager Washington shared that he spoke with
the King County CEO in Washington, D.C. about the program. There have
been significant costs to the agency and they have had 4 or 5 fare increases
since 2008 for all other riders. General Manager Washington stated that
there is definitely a cost to an agency in having a low income fare program.
He said that staff would be looking to get additional documented information
from King County. Committee Chair Anderson noted that they have also cut
service during that time.
Director Lubow thanked staff for their hard work during such an intense
process. She asked if staff could provide the final classification list of
Express and Regional bus routes. She feels it would be helpful to have this
information when speaking with her constituents. Lacy Bell stated that she
would send the Board the information.
Director Lubow shared that she sent an opinion article written by former
Boulder County Sheriff George Epp from the Boulder Daily Camera to several
staff members. In the article it discusses how RTD local bus fares have
gone up about 60% since 2006 while the consumer price index rose only
about 16%. She wonders if those numbers are accurate and if so, could
Packet Pg. 50

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 17, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Menten suggested putting information about the fare study on the
functioning kiosks throughout the District for additional outreach. She asked
if staff could provide her with how many people benefitted from the $5.8
million in reduced fare. Tony McCaulay said that staff would provide the
Board with the number of ticketbooks and passes that were purchased by
agencies but did not track the specific number of people.

6.G

staff provide an explanation for why our increase is so much higher.
General Manager Washington said that staff would send the Board the
information.

Director Archuleta requested a list of the participating agencies. Tony
McCauley said he would send it to the Board.
Director Tobiassen said that he has heard frequently from the non-profits
about the need for an improved low income program. He asked if staff
envisioned the income requirements in the new version remaining the same.
He said he has also heard concern about undocumented immigrants. He
wonders how that might fit into our program. Tony McCaulay stated that
income guidelines could be reviewed but when 50% of your ridership
already qualifies he is not sure how much those can really change. Tony
McCaulay said that he did not really have an answer for the undocumented
immigrants as RTD does not require documentation of citizenship to get fare
media; it would be up to each agency in terms of how they qualified
individuals.
Director Folska shared that at the recent APTA Legislative conference she
had lunch with the CEO of the Savannah Transit System. She explained
that the have a very innovative way of having very low fares, though she
does not know all the details. She suggested that staff look into this
program.
Chair Sisk said that he too had been presented with the statistics referenced
by Director Lubow. He thinks that fare increases need to be discussed
logically so he is interested to get staff’s analysis of the past increases.
General Manager Washington recognized Lacy Bell for her great work on this
project. He said she is really one of the agency’s superstars.

• Access-a-Ride/Cab 4th Quarter Report
Mike Gil, Deputy Assistance General Manager of Bus Operations, stated that
the report was available in the March 17, 2015 Operations and Customer
Service Committee Agenda Packet and asked if there were any questions.
There were no questions from the Board.

Packet Pg. 51

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 17, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Deadwyler shared that in speaking with non-profits, she learned that
while RTD may serve 200 agencies, there are over 1,600 in the state. She
wonders if we are willing to work with new non-profits and if so, how much
might it cost RTD. Scott Reed explained that the program is open to all
qualifying agencies. He said the cost is unknown as it depends on how
many agencies participate as well as any changes that may result from the
surveys and discussions with non-profits.

• Special Services 4th Quarter Report 2014

Director Hoy thanked the Board and staff for their continued support of the
Federal Heights Call-n-Ride. He noted that ridership was down in December,
but it also appeared to be down for most Call-n-Rides. He wondered if that
was a normal trend for December or something else. Carolyn Conover,
Senior Manager of Contracted Services, said that Brain Matthews, Senior
Manager of Special Services, was unable to attend due to an illness but she
would have him follow-up with Director Hoy.
Director Francone thanked the Special Service team for their work. She
shared that she was visiting the senior resource center in Evergreen. She
said they are very interested in moving forward with a transportation
advisory committee, which she hopes to be part of as well. Director
Francone passed along a comment from her husband that the South Jeffco
Call-n-Ride has been working very well as a result of restructuring to better
meet light rail schedules. She said he really appreciates the service.

• Contracted Fixed-Route Quarterly Report – 4th Quarter 2014
Mike Gil, Deputy Assistance General Manager of Bus Operations, stated that
the report was available in the March 17, 2015 Operations and Customer
Service Committee Agenda Packet and asked if there were any questions.
There were no questions from the Board.

• 4th Quarter Customer Complaint Analysis
Mike Gil, Deputy Assistance General Manager of Bus Operations, stated that
the report was available in the March 17, 2015 Operations and Customer
Service Committee Agenda Packet and asked if there were any questions.
Director Folska commended staff on their responsiveness to customer
complaints. There were several she was recently involved with and the
response went beyond anyone’s expectation.

• 4th Quarter 2014 Security Statistics & Fare Inspection Summary
Mike Gil, Deputy Assistance General Manager of Bus Operations, stated that
the report was available in the March 17, 2015 Operations and Customer
Service Committee Agenda Packet and asked if there were any questions.
Director Hoy commented that something he is always concerned about is
fare checks. He shared that several weeks ago he got on a train at Denver
Union Station for the Pepsi Center and his fare was checked.

• Light Rail Safety Update
Dave Genova, Assistant General Manager of Safety, Security and Facilities,
and Terry Emmons, Assistant General Manager of Rail Operations, reviewed
a Power Point presentation with the Board that is available in the March 17,
2015 Operations and Customer Service Committee Agenda Packet.
Dave Genova explained that the rail regulatory environment is much different
from that of operating buses. While all accidents involving RTD vehicles or
property are investigated, for any accident involving rail or on rail transitcontrolled property, RTD must submit a report to the Colorado Public Utilities
Commission (PUC) for approval. He stated that these reports are highly
scrutinized.
Dave Genova informed the Board that every month there is an Executive
Safety and Security Committee (ESSC) that meets to review every accident
and conduct trend analysis. The goal of this analysis is to find anything that
RTD can do to work toward prevention of those accidents. He stated that
minutes are transcribed and sent to the General Manager and Federal
Railroad Administration. Dave Genova said that several years ago the
Committee noticed that 99% of the rail accidents happened Downtown in
the street running environment and most of these accidents were between
automobiles and trails. He explained that based upon this analysis RTD put
in some active flashing light train indicators. As a result there was a dip in
these accidents. He noted this is just one example of staff’s efforts to
reduce and prevent accidents.
Dave Genova explained that there is a difference between a reportable
accident and a preventable accident. An accident that is non-preventable
can still be reportable per the PUC requirements; additionally, just because
the driver of the automobile is cited does not mean it is non-preventable.
Dave Genova pointed out that there were 51 accidents in 2014, which is
high, but only one accident was preventable. He said on the surface the
ESSC has not identified any trends that can be targeted but will continue to

review. He commented that between 2012 and 2014, 95% of all accidents
had damage of less than $1,000 and 90% had no injuries. He said this
illustrates that a most of the accidents that occurred are minor.

Terry Emmons outlined the rail operator training program. It is an extensive
5 week program that combines classroom and hands on training with a
Training Supervisor. He said that his team is very excited to get the
simulator as it will really enhance the training program. Terry Emmons noted
that in addition to operator’s initial training there are ongoing refresher
classes, mandatory continuing education, and annual certification ride
checks.
Director Bagley stated that the rail operator training is extremely important.
He asked staff to speak to the status of the commuter rail operator training
program. General Manager Washington said that Denver Transit Partners’
ramp up is underway. He suggested bringing their General Manager and
staff to a meeting over the summer to brief the Board on their program.
Director Menten inquired how our suicide statistics compare to other
agencies. Dave Genova said that RTD has had very few suicide events. He
stated that there are other transit agencies that have a huge problem with
suicides, some even going to far as to engage in suicide prevention
activities.
Director Menten wondered what sort of collision our cross arms could
withstand at an at-grade crossing. She asked if someone was sliding on ice
would the arms really provide any resistance as they look pretty flimsy.
Terry Emmons explained that the gates are designed to be spring loaded; if
there is an impact to the gates they open so as to not get damaged. He said
it would take a pretty good force to activate the springs but if someone was
sliding they could continue to slide through the crossing.
Director Folska asked when staff anticipated delivery of the simulator. Terry
Emmons shared that two staff members will be traveling next week to do
the factory acceptance testing. Once the testing is complete it should arrive
in May and be operational mid-June.
Director Folska said that when she was attending the APTA Legislative
Conference there was a lot of discussion about removing the space between
train cars for safety. She wonders if this is something staff is familiar with.
She suggested staff look into some of the literature written around

Dave Genova noted that there have been two fatalities each year from 2012
to 2014. In 2014 both fatalities were ruled suicides. He said in 2012 and
2013 the fatalities were also non-preventable.

doing outreach and education. Dave Genova stated that discussion about
the space between cars has been going on for years; however,
implementation really varies depending on the system.

aggressive schedule and there will be times when the full committee cannot be in

Letters to the Senior Leadership team have been sent out inviting them to apply for the
position of interim General Manager. Our target dates are April 1 for a response, followed
by the interview time with hopes to name an interim by April 10. This is another
aggressive schedule and will require a Special Board meeting for the full Board members to
vote on the recommended candidate.
Director Bagley raised the question if the invitation was sent to any others. Chair Sisk
indicated the invitation has only been extended to Senior Leadership. He noted it is
appropriate to let the other interested parties know of the process.

Paula Perdue shared that in light of the transitional changes, the strategic planning
advance agenda has been changed to allow times for the Board members to discuss
the attributes they are looking for in a General Manager. The agenda will focus in the
morning on determining the top strategic goals for the agency in 2016. Assuming this
deliverable is met, SLT staff will be excused around 12:30 and the Board will
participate in a facilitated session on General Manager Attributes. Chair Sisk added
that the documented process for the GM Executive Search Committee provides
opportunities for this input to be obtained from Board members as well as staff and
other interested parties. However, we are trying to be sensitive to some of the
concerns we heard from Board members on Tuesday in making sure they had adequate
input. The Executive Search Committee will be putting a communications plan
together on our outreach strategy. Chair Sisk also shared it is a mutual decision that
General Manager Washington will not attend this strategic planning advance. Per the
succession plan, the Interim General Manager Genova will provide the staff’s 20152016 challenges.
Director Bagley inquired about the ongoing status of the General Manager Oversight
and Performance Management Committee. One of the deliverables from the strategic
planning advance is the tactical plans which are really the agency tactical plans. Will
this process be abolished for 2015? Also, what are the plans for the evaluation
process that occurs at the end of the year? General Manager Washington responded
that he had discussed this with his team. It is important that the process continues
and stays on track for the interim goals. The “interim general manager” will need to be
given more time to evaluate the tactical goals coming from this advance so he can
prepare the next step of providing the implementation details. There are a couple of
decisions that will need to be made. Will there be an evaluation of the Interim General
Manager and how robust should that be? How do we merge the goals that are
established from the joint strategic planning advance with the attributes for a General
Manager? All of these must be a consideration but the need to move ahead with the
process is important. Director Tobiassen added that his concern is none of this impact
on the budget calendar.
General Manager Washington expressed his appreciation to Chair Sisk for his
understanding and support relative to the discussions of his termination from RTD. He
expressed that he had lots of thoughts, mixed feelings and sadness as he leaves the
agency he has come to love. He believes this the best agency in the country; we have
accomplished some amazing things, and he hopes that we continue at the stellar
performance on a local and nationwide basis we have achieved. He was challenged
from the Board when he accepted the General Manager position, to present and elevate
this agency into one of the top agencies in the country. He believed he accomplished
this. He has had an excellent team to work with and he appreciates the support of the
Board and GM Oversight and Performance Management Committee Chair Bagley.

Director Bagley shared that they had held a SW corridor stakeholder meeting at the
Mansion. The wonderful RTD staff consisting of Susan Wood, Andy Mutz and others
pulled together this amazing meeting. Representatives from all over the corridor
attended. There were three Board members present, Bagley, Francone and Lasater.
Everyone was interested in how we work the $115M extension of the corridor.
Director Bagley referred to his request to the Executive Committee for video recording
of the meetings. He identified three things that he stated make this more urgent than
ever: New General Manager, fare study and being only one of three elected Boards,
the constituents have a right to know. He placed an urgent request for this to be
implemented sooner than later. He thinks it is worth the $50K or so it would cost.
Director Tobiassen concurred that we need to move ahead. Chair Sisk also concurred
but stated since this was not on the agenda this month, he would like to have this as
an action for the Executive Committee next month. Chair Sisk stated that whatever
we do, we must do it in the most professional manner possible.
General Manager Washington concurred and stated it must be done in a professional
manner. We may need to get 3rd party resources but he will accept this as a head nod
for him to get his team to start the process for making this happen. This includes
identifying sources of funds and defining the scope. Director Bagley indicated that
ideally, it would cover the Board Chamber and the 3rd Floor Executive Conference
room. Director Walker inquired of the timeline and the plans to relocate this office.
General Manager Washington indicted they are looking at options but the plans are too
half-baked to bring before the Board. He anticipates at least 6 months before they will
be ready to discuss.
Director Folska inquired of Director Bagley what is the plan for distribution. Director
Bagley stated that his initial thought is streaming via web. Director Tobiassen
indicated there are lots of ways to do this including a YouTube Channel. He believes
there are affordable and reasonable alternatives.
Paula Perdue stated she is fine with these plans. However, it must be very clear they
will need to have their own resources and funds to provide this video service. The
Board office cannot assist in any way and is already overtasked with the work before
them.

Public Participation






Audrey DeBarros, 36 Commuting Solutions which is the TMO for the US 36
Corridor, commented on the draft fare structural proposal. They appreciated that
RTD listened to the concerns on US 36. They like the simplified fare structure and
the all day pass. They also liked the use of the local fare along the Route BV.
However, they are concerned about the need to coordinate the BRT planning efforts
of the US 36 with the fare structure study and would like to make sure this is a
coordinated effort including the pricing for US 36 BRT. They are also concerned
about the one fare ride along LRT and where the replacement revenue will be made
up over the long term. They believe one of the effects is to lower fares to
passengers who are already paying the least.
Erin Bennett, State Director for the 9-5 group from Denver, spoke on behalf of
affordable transit. She stated they were quite surprised and disappointed in their
initial review of the proposed structure; the increase to $5.20 per day from the
present is not a cost that can readily be absorbed by the low income transit
dependents. They need a robust mass transit system. She appealed to the RTD
Board to make transit affordable to all. Transit needs to be reasonable for all, not
only for those who can afford.
Margaret Johnson, Federal Heights, shared that she travels without exception on
RTD. She is truly a transit dependent. She cannot afford $5.00 on anything. She
shared a story of some of her recent travels where she had to catch multiple buses
and also walk some portion of the trip. She relayed much of this was caused by
being passed up by RTD buses or misdirected in schedules through information

from our TIC. She also stated the bus drivers were impolite and damaging
passengers with abrupt stops, etc.
Kara Choquette, Denver, lives near the light rail at University Station and is a
frequent rider. Her concern is with the lack of sufficient parking spaces there. RTD
committed public spaces to the housing development along the light rail which had
the inadvertent impact on riders trying to park there. She believes there are a
number of options available to remedy this situation: She has noted there are at
least 15 unused parking spots on the developer’s premise. We could remove the
reserved sign commensurate with use of the spaces on the developer’s premise.
We need to also check the price the developer is paying for these parking spaces.
They are currently paying $24 which is not compatible with the going rate for such
spaces (approximately $40). We have given a good deal to the developer on
premium parking spaces while subrogating the parking needs of our riders.
Garry Miller, Denver, also spoke on the parking needs at University Station. He
stated the situation is grave and needs to be addressed. He has noticed that in
addition to the issue raised by the previous speaker, DU students are also parking in
this garage. They are not part of the commuting public. RTD needs to re-consider
the parking attendant or establish security in the parking structure. If they are
looking for citizen volunteers to work on a solution, he is receptive.
Tom Trujillo, West Denver, stated that his car is currently broken and he will need
to make a decision between fixing it or riding mass transit. His preference is to ride
mass transit but the proposed fare structure is scaring him. Getting rid of the
transfers takes away flexibility. He believes RTD should be looking for ways to
increase ridership rather than hiking the price which will drive people away.
Hanni Raley, The Arc of Aurora, spoke on behalf of the intellectually and
developmentally disabled community. She stated they have participated in the RTD
fare study for about 2 years. She noted there is an unintended consequence of the
fare study-the impact on the paratransit population. Paratransit riders use about
58% of their personal allotment. With paratransit costs being about twice the
amount of fixed route, an increase in fixed route will also increase paratransit costs.
This will reduce the amount of resources available to the disabled community for
access to other services such as behavior services. There is also a challenge with
access-a-ride accepting 10 pass coupons.
Dace West, Mile Hi Connects, represents over 120 different businesses and nonprofit organizations. She is concerned where does low income fit into the proposed
fare structure. They would like to see the specific plans and timelines to address
affordability before approval of this fare structure. She also noted that the RTD
process for the fare study has moved up two months ahead of the initial schedule
that was laid out in the fare study plan.
Violet Deseguin from Denver works with Prax(us), a homeless group that does
outreach in places where the vulnerable population lives. Quite simply, the

Packet Pg. 63

homeless cannot afford a bus pass. He and his associates have been in violation of
our fare policy many times as they hop LRT to get to the homeless. He
understands that what he does is wrong but he is committed to outreaching to the
homeless and he has a job to do. They are looking for some affordable options.
Upping fares are obscene. They pay taxes and to hear they cannot get transfers
does not help their cause. He is looking for help for the transit dependents and our
homeless population who lives in a cycle of desperation already.

16th Street Mall Intersection Improvements, Funding Intergovernmental Agreement
with the City and County of Denver
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorizes the General Manager, or designee, to execute an
Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) between the City and County of Denver (CCD) and
the Regional Transportation District. The purpose of the IGA is to set forth the rights,
duties and obligations of CCD and RTD to construct intersection improvements within
the CCD Right-of-Way in conjunction with the 16 th Street Mall Reconstruction Project.
The intersection improvements will be funded by CCD, and the construction managed
by RTD.
Primary Motion:

Director Anderson made the motion to approve the 16
Street Mall Intersection improvements, funding
Intergovernmental Agreement with the City and County
of Denver.
Director Bagley seconded the motion.

Amendment to
Motion:

Director Lasater expressed he had spent time
researching this issue and proposed the following
amendment: “CCD will pay any and all invoices
submitted to RTD by the contractor directly associated
with the intersection improvements on or before the
due date of said invoices.”
Director Archuleta seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Director Hoy requested a restatement of the
amendment.
Director Walker stated that RTD will receive monies
from Denver to do the work; in that case the invoice
would come to RTD, not Denver.
General Manager Washington requested Henry
Stopplecamp, engineering manager, to provide clarity
on this issue. Henry stated the bid opened on
continued price for RTD to do the work. The contract
will bill RTD for RTD and City. As soon as RTD receives
the bill we will invoice the city and the reimbursement
will occur as soon as possible. To hold this process up

will create payment delays for the contractors and
subcontractors and could result in an increase in cost to
the contract to account for this delay in payment. RTD
should have funds to pay for the invoice so as not to
delay the process.
Director Walker reiterated this could slow down the
payment process for our contractors and he will not
support the amendment.
Director Folska stated the intent is not to hold up
payment for the contractors; RTD should not be
financing the work.
Director James stated he agrees with Director Walker.
This appears to be creating barriers to the process.
General Manager Washington reiterated this will impact
on the small subcontractors and contractors. This will
also impact the IGA.
Henry Stopplecamp provided further explanation. He
noted the contractor’s billing cycle would be extended
out to approximately 60 days versus the 30 days. This
will increase fees to cover the cost of the funds. This
could raise the overall cost of the project.

improvements, funding Intergovernmental Agreement
with the City and County of Denver with the amended
language “CCD will pay any and all invoices submitted
to RTD by the contractor directly associated with the
intersection improvements on or before the due date of
said invoices.”
Discussion:

Director Bagley inquired if this action could be
rescinded or reconsidered. Marla Lien, legal counsel,
replied it could only be rescinded by someone on the
prevailing side.
Director Lasater expressed outrage at the comments
from Henry Stopplecamp related to the impact of
changing the invoicing. He stated in all his years in
business, this is part of doing business. When RTD
receives the invoice, that same day they could simply
forward copy to City of Denver who would need to pay
by due date. He cannot see where this will postpone
the process. These comments have nothing to do with
contracts and are not applicable.
AGM Rick Clarke provided further explanation. He
understands the Board member’s attempt to get RTD
paid as soon as possible. However, in the normal
process, it generally takes 1 week to review the invoice
for accuracy, etc; then when we forward it to Denver
and they will need time on their end for a similar review
to validate the invoice. This does build delay in the
process. It will complicate the signing of the IGA. We
have several IGA’s with various municipalities, etc.
The proposed process of reimbursement has never been
a problem. In fact, we are concerned this could
complicate our overall relationship with the City of
Denver who is one of our greatest partners.
General Manager Washington added this revised
process could act as a negative with our strategic
partner, the City of Denver, as well as other partners
across the region. He is concerned about this
amendment’s impact on our partnerships.

Director Bagley wanted to know who was the woman in the audience who
throughout the meeting was making comments. Barbara McManus explained that
per our policy, we must provide interpretive services for our meetings if requested
within 48 hours. The lady in the meeting was interpreting the meeting for our
Spanish speaking riders. Director Bagley requested if the Board could be advised of
this for future meetings.
Director Solano indicated that he had been asked why we do not provide bus
services to the Red Rocks concerts. AGM Bruce Abel explained that these events
do not meet the size requirements for us to provide service.

The downtown business district consists of 35m sq. ft. of office space with
9 of the 40 top metro leases and 6 new buildings under contract; the SE
consists of 45.8m sq. ft. of office space with 17 of the top 40 metro leases
and 4 buildings under construction
o Downtown Denver is the only municipality that does not pay last mile and
gets free service
Director Bagley comments these statistics need to be put in perspective. The SE
does not have the same level of density or concentration of jobs as downtown
Denver.
Director Folska stated she understood that we will be discussing the 16 St Mall at
our study session in March. She looks forward to this information. She inquired if
this could include our stakeholders in this discussion. She is interested in some of
the comments made by Brad Buchanan in our PEST workshop where he talks about
the Copenhagen model. We need to understand the effect on new mall shuttles
and our investments along the mall both from the maintenance side and investment
in mall shuttles.
Director Solano added that he thinks it is premature for us to buy new mall shuttles
before we understand the full impact. We are putting the cart before the horse.
Director James commented the process is good. We have been addressing the mall
shuttle for over 4 year now so it will be good to share the historical perspective and
revisit this discussion.
General Manager Washington commented that above all, our focus has been on the
serviceability of the shuttles on the mall. This is an ongoing financial drain. The
new mall shuttles have been on order because the current fleet needs to be
replaced. They will invite stakeholders to this study session in March and provide
the historical perspective as well as impact on ridership and funding.
Director Menten commented she is looking forward to this study session in March.
She has been doing some research and trying to look at the big picture. It certainly
appears to be a huge drain. She also commented about an article in the Denver
Post about the snowstorm where she saw one of the RTD riders who is transit
dependent get hit by a vehicle and fall over the roof. She noted that in the image
close by was the route 16 bus which could have easily ran over this rider. She
commented that our focus on safety is important. She also noted that the study
session in March on the 16 St Mall is a good candidate for videotaping.
Director Folska reiterated her understanding that numbers or statistics can be
misleading. She thinks Bagley’s point was well taken in terms of density and
concentration. However, it is a fact that there has been much development along
the SE corridor and quoted the Charles Schwab complex.
Director James agreed that density and concentration along the central business
district is higher than the SE corridor. Ridership is highest on our 16 St Mall shuttle
because of density. There are consequences to changing the mall. The mall shuttle

connects people getting off our buses and LRT at the Civic Center to their final
destination around DUS. He also stated that his understanding is the vast majority
of mall shuttle riders are those whose trip originated elsewhere such as Southeast
Denver.
Chair Sisk commented this is a good discussion but expressed that we need to be
focusing on what is best for RTD. Our focus should be on the greater good and not
necessarily trying to pit one side of this city with another.

Request for Increase to SmartCard Contract
and Budget Transfer

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to increase the Xerox Transport Solutions contract not-toexceed amount by $1,300,000 to a new contract amount not-to-exceed $21,031,382 and to authorize
a budget transfer of up to $3,800,000 to fund activities under this contract.
DISCUSSION
Staff is seeking Board authorization to increase the Xerox SmartCard contract by $1,300,000 in order to
expand the scope of the contract to include work that was not originally anticipated at that stage of the
project.
Staff is also seeking authorization to provide funding through a budget transfer of up to
$3,800,000 to fund this additional $1,300,000 of work as well for those work items previously
approved by the Board in October 2014.
The following new activities are proposed to be added to the scope of work of the Xerox contract:
Bus validators for Call-n-Ride vehicles- SmartCard validators have been installed and are being used on
fixed route buses. RTD planned to install SmartCard validators on approximately 60 Call-n-Ride vehicles
in the future. With the proposed fare structure recommended for implementation in 2016, it will be
necessary to install SmartCard readers on Call-n-Ride vehicles sooner than initially planned as transfers
will be eliminated and SmartCards and day passes will become the primary sources of payment. Call-nRide vehicles must be equipped with SmartCard validators to accommodate the new fare structure.
Funding of $800,000 under the Xerox contract will be necessary.
SmartCard Hosting - RTD is working with Xerox to provide a hosting solution for its SmartCard
technology. Xerox provides hosting services for other agencies using SmartCard technology and has the
in-house expertise and systems to provide this service to RTD. In order to facilitate the transfer of
hosting RTD’s SmartCard technology, additional scope of work of $500,000 under the Xerox contract
may be necessary.
In addition to these new activities, in October 2014, the Board of Directors authorized an increase in the
Xerox contract to include $2,349,912 of new work items. Board authorization is now being requested
to fund those items through a budget transfer as follows:
Additional web portal and process system changes are necessary to complete the SmartCard
functionality needed for the remaining project elements such as stored value, monthly passes and backend coding to accommodate the proposed fare structure. Funding necessary for this functionality is
$1,300,000.

Packet Pg. 75

12.A

Additional owner’s representative services are necessary to complete the remaining project elements for
the SmartCard project including business process development and additional guidance and oversight for
implementation. Funding necessary for these services is $1,200,000.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The estimated unfunded cost of completing the above items is $3,800,000. Funding is available from
proceeds already received from the issuance of Certificates of Participation (COPs) in which certain of
those proceeds are not currently needed for their original intent such as the purchase of Mall Shuttles.
Therefore, there would be no budgetary impact; rather a transfer of funds would be completed from
other projects to the SmartCard project. This funding will be backfilled through the 2015 amended
budget process.

ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the General Manager or his designee to increase the Xerox Transport Solutions contract
not-to-exceed amount by $1,300,000 to a new contract amount not to exceed $21,031,382 and
authorize a budget transfer of up to $3,800,000. This is the recommended action.
2. Do not authorize the General Manager or his designee to increase the Xerox Transport Solutions
contract not-to-exceed amount by $1,300,000 to a new contract amount not to exceed
$21,031,382 and complete a budget transfer of $3,800,000. This is not the recommended
action because RTD would be unable to complete and implement the SmartCard system or the
new fare structure.

Subject:

Authorization to execute a budget transfer to
purchase thermal printers

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute a budget transfer in an amount up to
$1,900,000 from the Mall Shuttle project in order to purchase and install the equipment necessary to
accommodate the sale of fare media under the proposed fare structure.
BACKGROUND
RTD has proposed a modified and simplified fare structure to the Board to be enacted in January 2016.
Under the new fare structure, it is proposed that transfers be eliminated and a day pass be offered to
customers for purchase on board RTD buses. The day pass is proposed to be priced at two times the
single fare and would allow a customer to have unlimited rides during a service day, thereby not
requiring a rider to purchase a fare at each transfer.

DISCUSSION
In order to make the day pass widely available to RTD’s patrons, the ability to purchase day passes is
needed at the location where a patron accesses RTD’s services either on buses or at rail platforms. RTD
currently has the ability to sell day passes at rail platforms through ticket vending machines (TVMs) and
at sales outlets but currently does not have the ability to offer day passes to patrons who purchase their
first fare upon entering a bus. In order to offer a day pass on buses, a thermal printer would be installed
in each bus whereby a customer would pay for the day pass through the farebox and the operator would
produce a day pass from the thermal printer. The day pass will be printed on watermarked paper and
would clearly indicate the service day for which it is valid.
Although the Board has not yet authorized RTD to implement the new fare structure, authority to enter a
contract for the purchase and installation of thermal printers is being sought at this time due to the lead
time necessary to complete this procurement to meet the January 2016 fare structure implementation. If
the final Board action approving changes to RTD’s 2016 fare policy does not include a day pass, thus
negating the need for thermal printers, this funding will not be used.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The estimated cost of installing thermal printers on each of the approximately 1,000 buses in the RTD
fleet is $1,900,000. This cost includes the equipment as well as the connections and installation
necessary to tie the printers into the RTD network.
The funding necessary for this procurement would come from a portion of the Certificate of Participation
(COP) proceeds that were authorized by the Board to be used for the replacement of Mall Shuttles.

Packet Pg. 77

12.B

Therefore, there would be no need to seek additional funding for this procurement and no budgetary
impact other than the transfer of funds from one project to another. These funds will be backfilled
through the 2015 amended budget process.

ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute a budget transfer in order to
purchase and install the equipment necessary to accommodate the sale of fare media under
the proposed 2016 fare structure. This action grants authority to execute a budget transfer in
an amount not to exceed $1,900,000 from the Mall Shuttle project. This is the recommended
action.
2. Do not authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute a budget transfer. This action
would result in RTD’s inability to procure needed day pass fare media equipment in time to
provide the ability for patrons to purchase day passes on buses and avoid multiple fare payments
for transfers. This is not the recommended action.
