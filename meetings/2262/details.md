## IV. Retiree Awards

There were four retirees for the month of March but only one was in attendance.

General Manager Washington introduced Kevin St. Croix, retired Division Manager, and asked Bruce Abel, AGM of Bus Operations, and Mike Gil, Deputy AGM of Bus Operations, to join them.

Bruce Abel said that Kevin is retiring after 35 years of service at RTD.  He started in 1980 as a bus operator.  Mike Gil shared that an interesting part of Kevin’s career is that he is one of the few that remember the layoffs in 1981-1982.  He drove a bus for 5 years, went to the Alameda division as a Dispatcher, moved to District Shops as a Lead Dispatcher and spent the last part of his career as a Division Manager at multiple RTD divisions.  Mike Gil said that he has been one outstanding asset to RTD and he will be missed terribly.

Kevin St. Croix said it has been a great career at RTD.  He remembers coming to a Board meeting and telling the Directors they were dysfunctional during some very public disputes, which was a shaky time in his career.  There were some good times and bad times but for the most part it was a great place to work.  He thanked RTD for the privilege to work here.

Chair Sisk congratulated Kevin on his retirement and thanked him for his years of service.  He said that our employees make the District the success that it is.

Dennis R. Bangert – Light Rail Train Operator – 31 years

William W. Berkhimer – Street Supervisor, Bus Operations – 31 years

Ronald Garcia – Light Rail Train Operator – 30 years

Kevin M. St. Croix – Division Manager, Platte – 35 years

## V. Public Participation

- Doug Gragg, Denver, said his concern this evening is for the selection committee for the General Manager.  He realizes that there is the political practice of RTD looking nationally for a new General Manager, he believes that if the Board looked locally within the District the committee could find a minority woman that could fill the position.  There is no need to go to NY City to do it.

- Gary Van Dorn, National Federation of the Blind Board Member and President of the National Federation of the Blind CO Chapter, expressed the NFBCO’s concern over the recent outage of the automated stop announcements.  While they were happy that the RTD sent out a very clear and concise email about the issue that also asked drivers to announce the stops, many drivers failed to do so.  He requested that RTD provide the NFBCO with an explanation of what caused such a catastrophic failure in the automated stop announcement system.

- Shantá Farrington, Denver, works as a Community Organizer for Front Range Economic Strategy Center (FRESC).  This organization provides outreach and support, especially to low-income and disadvantaged communities, during community engagement processes.  She said that FRESC supports the Mile High Connects fare proposal; they hope that prior to any decisions related to fare in the next few weeks the community’s voice will be heard.

- Joe Tripplet, Denver, expressed concern over the proposed increases to the Access-a-Ride fare.  He worries that eventually Access-a-Ride riders, especially seniors and the disabled, will no longer be able to afford the cost of this service.  He recognized that while Access-a-Cab is a great alternative, it is not a realistic alternative in the outlying areas of the District.  He asked staff to provide him the rule that Access-a-Ride fare must be twice the fare of a comparable fixed route.

- Andrea Suhaka, Denver, DRMAC Board Member and Chair of the Transportation Solutions Arapahoe County, has been very involved in the fare study that Mile High connects is conducting.  She believes our low-income community is very disadvantaged with the new fares RTD is proposing.  She thinks the fares for low-income riders should be at the senior discount price or lower; people that depend on RTD for their living need to have a lower fare.

- Richard McClintock, Denver, has been a long time smart growth and livable communities advocate.  He looks forward to participating in RTD’s upcoming fare study public hearings; however, he is here tonight for a very different reason.  He would like to thank General Manager Washington for his service.  He can only say that this is a loss for RTD and LA’s gain.  He stated that the motto of building as much as we can as fast as we can has really come to fruition based on his leadership.  Rick McClintock recognized the challenge ahead of the Board in finding a new GM who is as smart and capable as GM Washington.

- Kenny Shepard, Denver, expressed his concern over the new proposed fare to DIA.  He believes RTD will get more revenue if we lower the fare to one that is comparable to other large cities, like $5.

- Hanni Raly, The Arc of Aurora, spoke on behalf of the intellectually and developmentally disabled community.  She said that many of the individuals they work with are dependent upon government assistance, low-income, and rely upon public transportation.  They see transportation as the conduit for full community inclusion, recognizing that annually 560,000 people with disabilities never leave their home because of transportation difficulties.  In looking at the proposed fare structure, her organization knows this number will only grow if adopted.  She expressed frustration that her organization is unable to participate in the Non-Profit Agency Reduced Fare Program as it is today, limiting their ability to assist their community that cannot afford our fares.  The administrative burdens, cumbersome tracking requirements and huge upfront costs preclude their participation since they receive no public funding.  She believes that in order for the program to be fully realized RTD needs to:

o        Consider decreasing the administrative burdens and tracking components

o        Consider offering a deeper discount or sliding scale for organizations that work with low-income populations

o        Consider expanding the program for offering payment options that do not require a complete upfront investment

o        Consider allowing cooperatives for non-profit organizations

She stated that by increasing access to programs that increase access to transit all of our communities win.

- Ana Barrera-Ochoa, Denver, spoke not only on behalf of FRESC but also on behalf of the low-income and working class families.  These groups are very concerned that the fares are going to increase.  The working class families are already struggling; it is very important they are taken into consideration as part of RTD’s fare study.  She said that not only are many of these families transit reliant but they also need transportation for better jobs and opportunities.

## VII. General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Update

Committee Chair Bagley commented that the Board and Senior Leadership Team had the planning advance for 2016 over the weekend.  The goal of this advance was to define specific task goals for the General Manager and Agency for 2016.  He said that the GM Oversight and Performance Management Committee would begin working with the Interim General Manager in late April to establish the tactical plans for achieving these goals.

Chair Sisk noted that the GM Executive Search Committee has been established and includes Directors Bagley, Deadwyler, Francone, Tobiassen and himself as Chair of the Committee.  The Committee had their first meeting this afternoon and achieved a great deal.  Chair Sisk recognized the work of Paula Perdue, Executive Director to the Board, as she was instrumental in making sure it was a good first meeting.  He shared that an invitation to apply was extended to the Senior Leadership team.  The deadline for applications is April 1st, interviews will be conducted shortly thereafter, with a goal of appointing an Interim General Manager the week of April 6th at a Special Board Meeting.  He noted that the Committee is moving promptly and efficiently so there is a smooth transition.   Chair Sisk recognized this is a large undertaking but it will be done in a very transparent way with input from employees, stakeholders, public, etc.

Chair Sisk recognized Director Tobiassen for his quick thinking at a recent community meeting where a constituent was having health problems.  He said that on behalf of Chair Sisk as a person and the Board as a whole, he thanked Director Tobiassen for stepping in and doing the right thing as his intervention probably saved that person’s life.

## X. General Manager's Report

General Manager Washington thanked the Board, and particularly Chair Sisk, for understanding his decision to move to LA Metro and their support during this process.  He also thanked the stakeholders, staff, mayors, commissioners and CDOT.  GM Washington said that what has been accomplished over the last six years, which is quite a bit, was really a joint and team effort.  He recognized that six years ago there was not much going on but now the West Line is open with 5 more openings coming in 2015.  He is very proud of the work the team has done.  GM Washington believes that we will not fully realize what we have accomplished for a couple decades when our grandchildren and great-grandchildren are using the transit infrastructure built under our watch.

GM Washington shared that on March 6th USDOT announced a pilot program and regulatory change that will allow transportation agencies to utilize local hiring preferences on USDOT funded projects.  In this pilot USDOT made no provision for comment and they allowed 30 days for comment on a permanent regulatory change.  He said that APTA has submitted a request to extend the comment period and would like to host a webinar for USDOT to explain what these provisions mean.  To date USDOT has not acted on the request for an extension.  He stated the current comment period ends April 6.  APTA will still have a webinar on March 26th at 12:00 p.m. Eastern time to discuss this provision and any legal issues that may arise.  GM Washington noted that the transit industry, especially the supply/private part of the industry, is pushing back on these provisions, especially as it relates to rolling stock.  He believes this webinar will do a good job in answering some of the questions out there.  He asked Marla Lien, General Counsel, to explain this provision as it relates to Colorado Laws.

Marla Lien explained that the change in regulation deals only with local hiring preferences pertaining to the use of labor.  In Colorado, the only statute on Colorado labor on public works does not apply to RTD; it applies to counties, school districts and municipalities requiring Colorado labor to perform 80% of the work on a public works project.  She stated that RTD does not have a local hiring preference policy nor do we have a state law applicable to labor on project.  In Colorado there are other statutes that would be implicated if the statute expands; there is a preference regarding commodities and services and there are bid preferences on public projects.  Both of these statutes do include RTD.  Marla Lien explained that those are not currently addressed by the regulatory change but the webinar will discuss what other kinds of labor or contracting could be affected by local hiring preferences if USDOT expands the program.  She stated that she is not concerned about this regulatory change diminishing competition on RTD’s projects even if the program goes forward.

GM Washington explained that this is one of USDOT Secretary Foxx’s initiatives called ladders of opportunity.  The idea is to ensure that local workers benefit from economic opportunities that transportation projects present.

GM Washington noted that a memo outlining the proposed Flatiron Flyer milestones would be sent to the Board.  The proposed dates are:

- June 30, 2015 – Media events announcing the arrival of the Flatiron Flyer pilot bus

- August 13, 2015 – Opening of Boulder Junction

- October 24, 2015 – Station Ribbon Cutting and Parties, full Flatiron Flyer fleet arrival

- January 17, 2015 – BRT service change

GM Washington shared that he was asked to present at the City and County of Denver’s Infrastructure and Cultural Committee tomorrow at the City and County of Denver Building.

Director Menten asked for clarification if USDOT would be participating in the APTA webinar.  She expressed concern that we would not really be able to learn how this might affect RTD if USDOT is not participating.  GM Washington said that USDOT had not confirmed their involvement but APTA plans to host the webinar either way.  He thinks that even if they do not officially participate there will be some USDOT representatives on the phone hearing the questions/concerns.

## XI. Unanimous Consent

There were no unanimous consent items.

### A. Request for Increase to SmartCard Contract and Budget Transfer

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to increase the Xerox Transport Solutions contract not-to-exceed amount by $1,300,000 to a new contract amount not-to-exceed $21,031,382 and to authorize  a budget transfer of up to $3,800,000 to fund activities under this contract.

Motion:              Director Tobiassen made the motion to approve the Request for Increase to SmartCard Contract and Budget Transfer.

Director Bagley seconded the motion.

Vote on

Motion:              The motion passed with 11 (Anderson, Archuleta, Bagley, Deadwyler, Folska, James, Lubow, Menten, Sisk, Tobiassen and Walker) in favor and 1 (Lasater) opposed.

Chair Sisk declared the motion PASSED.

### B. Authorization to execute a budget transfer to purchase thermal printers

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute a budget transfer in an amount up to $1,900,000 from the Mall Shuttle project in order to purchase and install the equipment necessary to accommodate the sale of fare media under the proposed fare structure.

Director Tobiassen shared that as the Chair of the Financial Administration and Audit Committee, he has been speaking with many Board members and staff, and it is clear there are still a number of questions that need to be addressed.  Director Tobiassen requested that this item be removed from this evening’s agenda and brought back to the Board at the April 21, 2015 Board meeting.  This would also allow for staff to provide a more in-depth explanation of this item at the April 14, 2015 Financial Administration and Audit Committee meeting to ensure everyone’s questions are answered.

Director Anderson expressed concern that postponing this item might set back the openings scheduled for 2016.  General Manager Washington stated that he and Director Tobiassen had discussed this item.  He stated that he does not have concerns about the timeline for the 2016 openings if this item is delayed until the next Board meeting.

Director Menten inquired if staff had consulted with the bond counsel at this time.  Marla Lien stated that was one of the things being worked on prior to the committee meeting briefing.

This item was delayed until the April 21, 2015 Board Meeting.

## XIII. Motion to Move Into Executive Session

Chair Sisk indicated that there was not a need for an Executive Session at this time so it was cancelled.

## XIV. Old Business

There was no old business.

## XV. New Business

Director Bagley asked GM Washington what items would be presented at next week’s Study Session.  GM Washington indicated that there would be a presentation about the 16th Street Mall.

Director Anderson shared what a great time everyone had at the Stand Up for Transportation Bus Signing in Arvada.  She thanked staff for doing such a wonderful job.

General Manager Washington thanked the RTD staff, led by Pauletta Tonilas, for all of their efforts related to Stand Up for Transportation Day on April 9th.  This is hugely important for infrastructure in this country as May 31 is the end date for MAP-21.  He stated that this event is gaining steam and brining attention to the issue.  He thanked the Directors for their support and participation.

Director Folska thanked staff for all their efforts surrounding Stand Up for Transportation.  She had her bus signing event recently and there were so many people signing that she does not think there is room for even one more signature.  She recognized the wonderful job that GM Washington has done within the District and thanked him for his efforts.

Director Menten expressed her appreciation for having the RTD Board/Senior Leadership Team Advance within the District.  She knows of government bodies that feel it is better to take an expensive trip outside their area, which she does not support.

Director Bagley stated that, in reference to the Strategic Planning Advance, there has never been any thought of having this anyplace but close to the Blake Street offices and within the District.

Director Lasater shared that he recently attended a Southwest (SW) Rail Extension meeting hosted by Director Bagley.  He complimented Director Bagley on having such an informative and well attended meeting.  He believes there was some very good dialogue related to the future of the SW Rail Extension.

Director Bagley thanked Director Lasater for his attendance at the meeting.  He noted that he has been working with staff for the last 6 months about the SW Rail Extension; the model for the Southeast Rail Extension has motivated his community to look at ways to move their extension forward.  He thanked staff and GM Washington for their involvement.
