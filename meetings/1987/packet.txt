New Starts Funding: Appropriations Outlook
§ Omnibus or CR? Transportation appropriators in the House and
Senate are negotiating from their respective FY 2015 THUD bills,
rather than rolling transportation spending into a continuing
resolution at FY 2014 levels.
§ The House and Senate top-line funding numbers are not far apart:
§ $70.2 billion in House
§ $71.7 billion in Senate

§ But policy disagreements remain, including the House bill’s
elimination of transit eligibility from the popular TIGER program.
§ Current spending authority for all federal government programs
ends on December 11.

Securing New Starts funding for EAGLE P3
FasTracks projects
Our Agenda:
§ Work to ensure RTD receives full $150 million in recommended
funding for the ongoing Eagle FFGA.
§ Push forward for Southeast Extension funding against

headwinds:

§ Demand has long exceeded available New Starts funding:

pipeline of projects awaiting grants.

§ Greater competition: expanded eligibility for Core Capacity

projects funded at $275 million in FY 2015.

MAP-21 Reauthorization: Funding Fix is Job 1
§ Congress passed a short-term revenue patch and MAP-21 program
extension through the end of May 2015, then immediately pivoted to
the larger funding and policy challenges of the next long-term surface
transportation bill.
§ The highway trust fund revenue crisis has been deferred – not solved.
§ Upcoming decisions on funding sources and levels will govern many
of the policy and program decisions for the next bill.
§ Meanwhile, our infrastructure investment gap is growing:
§ Ever-increasing transit ridership, and
§ Record-high $86 billion backlog of system preservation needs,
estimated to continue expanding at $2.5 billion per year at current
spending levels.

So how do we pay for it?

§ About $15 billion in new revenue per year is needed just to maintain
current spending levels, no program growth.
§ The available options are widely known and debated: no silver
bullet, only hard choices:
§ Cut transportation programs to align with current revenues.
§ Another short-term patch with general fund revenues ($62 billion

transferred to the HTF since FY 2008).

§ Raise additional long-term revenues, mainly from user fees.

MAP-21 Reauthorization: Likely Scenarios
§ Infrastructure investment still finds bicameral, bipartisan support in
Congress.
§ Spending priorities may change in the new Congress, but drastic cuts
to bring programs in line with current HTF revenues are not likely.
§ Congressional staff are now drafting bills assuming current funding
levels plus inflation; we must keep making the case for revenue
increases needed for program growth.
§ Revenue fix in the Lame Duck?
§ Unlikely but not impossible for Congress to address HTF revenues
in the lame duck session; some momentum in the Senate.
§ More likely in the new Congress as part of a larger tax package or
budget reconciliation.

Federal Funding Uncertainty: What could this
mean for RTD?

“The lack of stability and predictability of Federal dollars
hampers any major commitments for new projects. It also
hampers local elected officials and others in their vision for
what they want to do for their communities.”
Acting FTA Administrator Therese McMillan
before the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee
November 13, 2014

Packet Pg. 17

RTD Reauthorization Strategy:
§ Your message must be heard in Washington if you want to achieve
your vision for the Denver region.
§ While support for infrastructure remains a bright spot in an otherwise
divided and unproductive Congress, raising revenues is unpopular
and always challenging.
§ Keep making the case for much-needed infrastructure investment:
§ Ensure RTD continues to receive its fair share of transit funding.
§ Influence and shape policy decisions being made now:
§ Flexibility in the definition of BRT projects eligible for New Starts funding
§ FTA’s use of the horizon year for calculating New Starts project benefits
§ Streamlining, integration of the TIFIA and New Starts processes

Maintaining Stakeholder Engagement
§ New players and new roles on Capitol Hill: keep Congressional

issues.
§ New make-up of Colorado Congressional delegation:
§ Meet with new Senator Cory Gardner (R-CO) and newly-elected
Rep. Ken Buck (R-CO-04) on RTD’s latest challenges and
successes, including progress on North Metro rail line, US 36 BRT,
and the Southeast Corridor Extension project.
§ After the elections, several Members of Congress are in new
leadership positions on transportation committees; it is critical to
meet with these new Members.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

From:

William C. Van Meter,
Manager, Planning

Date:

Subject:

Approval of On-to-Off and Onboard Passenger
Surveys Consultant Selection

Assistant

Date: November 25, 2014
General

GM
Board Meeting Date: December 16, 2014

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager to execute all documents necessary to award a contract to ETC Institute for
the completion of an on-to-off and onboard passenger surveys project for an amount not to exceed
$1,435,000. Funding is included in the FasTracks 2015 budget.
BACKGROUND
This action supports and fulfills the General Manager Goals of Grow riders and engage customers
across the region because it will collect relevant data for the understanding of RTD passengers; and
Continue advancement of FasTracks because it moves RTD further toward completion of the full
FasTracks Plan.
The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) requires recipients of Full Funding Grant Agreements
(FFGAs) to complete “Before and After” studies and regularly update travel forecasting models for
the projects receiving grants. On-to-off and onboard passenger surveys collect important data for
understanding the context in which RTD passengers make their travel decisions. The data from these
surveys will be used in the development of the required “Before and After” studies of the West Rail
Line and Eagle project and for travel model updates used to develop RTD ridership forecasts.
DISCUSSION
The Civil Rights Division set a Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) goal of 15% of the contract
value and a Workforce Initiative Now (WIN) requirement of 20% of the personnel. Four teams submitted
proposals. The prime contractors were Dikita, ETC Institute, NuStats, and OGx. The evaluation team
consisted of four RTD staff members and one staff member from the Denver Regional Council of
Governments (DRCOG). ETC Institute is committed to meeting the DBE goal and WIN requirement.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for this project will come from a combination of local FasTracks funds from the West Rail
Line and a mix of federal and local FasTracks funds from the Eagle Project. Funding is included in
the FasTracks 2015 budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee
that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to execute all documents
necessary to award a contract to ETC Institute for the completion of an on-to-off and onboard
passenger surveys project for an amount not to exceed $1,435,000. Funding is included in
the FasTracks 2015 budget.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. This is not recommended because it would violate

After Studies for the West Rail Line and Eagle project.

local publications and stakeholder e-mail distributions beginning September 15, 2014. Applicants were
asked to submit a one-page letter stating their interest in serving on the CAC along with specific
qualifications, highlights of related experience and expertise and a resume if available. A total of 14
applications were received by the October 27, 2014 deadline. Four current members are eligible for
reappointment and three of the four expressed an interest in continuing to serve on the Committee.
The Nominating Committee decided, based on attendance, participation at meetings and Committee
consistency to recommend reappointment of the three current members who requested reappointment.
The Nominating Committee then carefully reviewed each application received in order to fill the final
position, considering criteria outlined in the Committee Structure adopted by the Board in 2005,
including:

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: November 26, 2014

From:

Richard F. Clarke, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

November 26, 2014

Board Meeting Date: December 16, 2014

Subject:

Recommendation for Contract Award to Mass.
Electric Construction Company (MEC) for OnCall Construction Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager to award a contract to Mass. Electric Construction Company (MEC), the
most qualified firm based on the application of the evaluation criteria, in the amount not to exceed
$67,229,300 for On-Call Systems Construction Services Contractor. The work in this Contract includes
providing new, retrofit, and emergency construction services for the Overhead Contact System, Traction
Power Systems, Fare Collection Systems, Signal and Communication System, and Trackwork
construction services. Funding for the contract award is included in the 2015 Adopted Capital Budget
for current year projects. Funding for future year projects will be authorized in future year budgets.
BACKGROUND
This action addresses the RTD 2014 goal of Innovative and Fiscally Sustainable Service Delivery and the
2015 goal of Improving Service Delivery. RTD has long employed on-call contractors to perform civil and
structural work on various projects. As RTD’s rail system has grown and with the complexity of
FasTracks, the need has arisen for an on-call systems construction services contract for electrical
systems. This is specialized work that can only be performed by specific contractors and is critical to
supporting Light Rail Operation.
In September 2014, RTD advertised a Request for Proposals for construction services for On-Call
Systems Construction work. On October 24, 2014, two written proposals were received:
1. Balfour Beatty Infrastructure Inc. (BBII)
2. Mass. Electric Construction Company (MEC)
The six RTD evaluation team members evaluated the written proposals and conducted a preliminary
ranking according to the following evaluation criteria:
A. Management, Organization, Experience and Approach………………..50%
B. Cost……………………………………………………………………………..35%
C. Commitment to and Substantive Utilization of Disadvantaged
and Small Businesses and WIN Program………………………………….15%
DISCUSSION
The ranking of the two proposals was very close as both firms have extensive experience and a good
track record with RTD. The following is the result of the evaluation by the six member evaluation team:
1. Mass. Electric Construction Company (MEC)
2. Balfour Beatty Infrastructure Inc. (BBII)

Packet Pg. 45

3.B.1

The team concluded that Mass. Electric Construction Company (MEC) was the recommended best value
contractor based on the following criteria:
A. Team Resources – The evaluation team believe Mass. Electric Construction Company (MEC)
demonstrated the ability to perform under the RFP, has the ability to fully support and provide
the necessary staff and equipment to fully implement the Scope of Work.
B. Project Management Approach – The evaluation team believe Mass. Electric Construction
Company (MEC) provided a strong project management approach including providing different
options for completing projects identified in the Scope of Work.
C. Schedule Performance and Approach – The evaluation team believe Mass. Electric
Construction Company (MEC) provided a thorough approach for schedule performance and
completion of projects. They demonstrated their ability, resources and capability to comply
with the Scope of Work.
In addition, Mass. Electric Construction Company’s (MEC) proposed DBE goal exceeded the 16% goal
advertised in the RFP and meets the 8% WIN goal. Therefore, the evaluation team recommends Mass.
Electric Construction Company (MEC) based on best value for RTD.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for the contract award is included in the 2015 Adopted Capital Budget for current year projects.
Funding for future year projects will be authorized in future year budgets.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee
that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to award a contract to Mass. Electric
Construction Company (MEC), the most qualified firm based on the application of the evaluation
criteria, in the amount not to exceed $67,229,300 for On-Call Systems Construction Services
Contractor. The work in this Contract includes providing new, retrofit, and emergency construction
services for the Overhead Contact System, Traction Power Systems, Fare Collection Systems, Signal
and Communication System, and Trackwork construction services. Funding for the contract award is
included in the 2015 Adopted Capital Budget for current year projects. Funding for future year
projects will be authorized in future year budgets.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to award a contract
to Mass. Electric Construction Company (MEC), the most qualified firm based on the application of
the evaluation criteria, in the amount not to exceed $67,229,300. This action is not recommended
because it will affect the capability to perform necessary State of Good Repair projects in a timely
manner on the current light-rail system. Also, the ability to quickly respond to critical systems
repairs on the light-rail system will be jeopardized.
3. Reject all submittals and reconsider the systems on-call construction services approach. This is not
recommended as experience has shown that an on-call services contract provides the highest quality
at the lowest price for these miscellaneous specialized projects. In addition, it provides immediate
response to any required emergency actions in the system area.
