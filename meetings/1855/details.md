#### 1. Approval of 2014 Recommended Budget

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors adopt Resolution No. ___, Series of 2013 for the adoption of the 2014 Budget, Resolution No. ___, Series of 2013 for the 2014 Budget Appropriation and Resolution No. ___, Series of 2013 for the appropriation of 2014 Previously Appropriated Capital.

The 2014 Budget Appropriation below includes the following projected operating expenses, debt and reserves, capital expenditures, and fund balances below (in thousands):

Motion:              Director Lasater made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the November 26, 2013 Board meeting.

Director Bagley seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Terry Howerter, Chief Financial Officer, stated that his team will be presenting to the Board the final 2014 Recommended Budget.  He noted that this item has been briefed to the Board over the last several months.

Jannette Scarpino, Manager of Budget and Financial Analysis, reminded the Board that they began reviewing the 2014-2016 Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) in April.  It was approved in July along with the expense and capital project plan.  Jannette Scarpino said that staff began the review process of the 2014 Recommended Budget in August and presented drafts in September and October.  She noted that the Board has had the opportunity to comment and provide input throughout the process.

Jannette Scarpino reviewed the Board Report and associated attachments with the Board that are available in the November 19, 2013 Financial Administration and Audit Committee Agenda Packet.

Director Sisk noted that diesel is budgeted at $3.26 per gallon and gasoline is budgeted at $3.54 per gallon.  He requested staff prepare figures that would reflect the prices if we did a fuel lock today.  He thought it would have an impact on the budget.  Jannette Scarpino stated that it would have a favorable impact on the budget.  She said staff would put the numbers together.

Director Deadwyler commented that there are a lot of base system reductions.  She asked if that would mean there are going to be service reductions in 2014.  Jannette Scarpino explained that these are largely one time changes that occurred in 2013 but will not occur in 2014; they are not necessarily a reduction in operating expense.  She stated this decrease is largely due to a $11 million Denver Union Station contribution that was budgeted in 2013, reduction in DBA expenses and reduction in grant pass through.

Director Tobiassen asked for clarification on the negative adjustment of $9 million for the Downtown Circulator.  Jannette Scarpino explained that this is showing the reconciliation between the amended budget from 2013 and the recommended budget from 2014.  She stated that the project was likely over budgeted in 2013 but as we get further into the projects staff gets better at the estimates/projections.

Director Solano asked why Stapleton was listed separately under Attachment B, Reconciliation of Changes.  Jannette Scarpino explained that this is also a reconciliation from 2013 to 2014 in terms of new capital.  This item was brought forward for Board Approval to add $2.7 million to Stapleton earlier in 2013.

#### 2. Annual Report to the Board - Interest Rate Swap Policy

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors approves the attached modifications to the RTD Interest Rate Swap Policy.

Motion:              Director Bagley made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the November 26, 2013 Board meeting.

Director Lasater seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Brenden Morgan, Manager of Debt and Investments, stated that at this time staff is not anticipating the need to enter a swap agreement at any point in the foreseeable future.  He said that based on this, staff is recommending that the Board does not need to review the policy on an annual basis; the Board will need to review the policy if the District is involved in or planning to enter a swap agreement.  Brenden Morgan noted there are some additional language changes being recommended to clarify the Policy and to reflect the implementation of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection that are outlined an the redline draft included in November 19, 2013 Financial Administration and Audit Committee Agenda Packet.

Director Tobiassen noted that not too long ago RTD got burned by some interest rate swaps.  He thinks it is good to not get involved in swaps any time soon.  Director Tobiassen also noted that the E-470 Board also got into situations with swaps that cost them a lot of money.  He believes these seem like one of the riskiest investments.  Director Tobiassen wonders why we might want to do interest rate swaps in the future.  Terry Howerter stated there are many reasons to do interest rate swaps; for example, if RTD had a fixed rate that was high and the market is low we may want to go to a lower rate.  He commented that all of RTD’s debt is at fixed rates currently.  Staff has refinanced all our debt to very low rates so we would not want to do any swaps at this time.

Director Bagley said that the previous swaps that may have gone against RTD were created during the downturn.  He stated that we are in a totally different environment today.  Director Bagley believes it is prudent to have this as part of RTD’s policy; this permits staff to come back to the Board and make a suggestion should it be necessary.  Terry Howerter stated that he agrees with Director Bagley.  He recommends keeping a swap policy in place.  He said if staff should deem it reasonable they would bring the policy and present proposal to the Board at that time.

Director Sisk asked for staff to clarify in the policy that any swap would be presented to the Board before it is entered.  Brenden Morgan stated that was the intent so staff would review the language to make it clearer before the Board meeting on November 26, 2013.

Committee Chair Walker declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

#### 3. 2014 Internal Audit Plan

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors approves the proposed plan of internal audits to be performed in 2014.

Motion:              Director Folska made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the November 26, 2013 Board meeting.

Director Deadwyler seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Ann Marie Isaac-Heslop, Manager of Internal Audit, noted that staff had requested comments or suggestions from the Board on the plan but no responses had been received.

Director Deadwyler asked if one of the audits was focused around RTD’s computer equipment and software.  She wondered if that would be audited at all.  Ann Marie Isaac-Heslop said there were several audits that would touch on IT.  One would be CDW looking at the purchase of computer equipment; there is also an audit of the Purchasing Cards and check requests for the IT department.  Director Deadwyler stated that she is looking for an audit on the performance of what RTD has already purchased.  She said that she submitted her request to the finance department.  Terry Howerter said that his understanding was that Director Deadwyler and Chair Anderson were going to discuss this matter to let him know how to proceed.  Chair Anderson said that she has not heard back from Director Deadwyler.  She believes there is an audit of Dataman USA LLC that might satisfy Director Deadwyler’s request.

Director Lubow noted that in the presentation it states that due to budget constraints there are no outside audits.  She wondered if this was standard operating procedure.  Scott Reed said that previously RTD might have used some external auditors; however, previous budget constraints caused RTD to begin conducting all audits internally.  He noted that RTD utilizes its internal audit department to do 20 per year.  With those audits and audits from various regulating agencies staff believes there is sufficient oversight.

Director Solano asked if, based on the Background Information Statement, the State of Colorado normally reviews RTD’s audits.  Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager of Communications, explained that during RTD’s most recent audit with the state it was recommended that in addition to the General Manager the Board also approve the internal audit plan.

Director Hoy commented that the list of audits seems pretty well fixed at this time.  He wondered if there was a way to add or modify anything.  Scott Reed stated that the Board has not yet approved the plan; if there was something specific the Board wanted to add or modify there would still be time.  He asked that the Board keep in mind that if the internal audit team does find other areas of concern as they proceed through the plan staff can always expand the audits or make adjustments as needed.

Committee Chair Walker declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

#### 2. 2014 Ridership Goal Model

General Manager Washington reminded the Board that this model was sent to them several weeks ago.  He said staff wanted to briefly review the process and answer any questions.  General Manager Washington recognized that there will need to be follow-up discussion on this; the Board needs to decide if they will accept this methodology for the already approved 2014 ridership goal or leave it as it was originally approved at a 2.8% increase.

Lee Cryer, Project Manager for Planning, shared that this was a team effort among several departments.  He explained that the statistical model that best explains historical changes in RTD ridership uses a combination of hours of service, employment and gas prices.  This model forecasts an increase in ridership of 1.3% from 2012 to 2013 and 0.6% from 2013 to 2014.  Lee Cryer stated the low increase for next year is due to the expectation that gas prices will decrease.

Director Folska thinks this work is wonderful and appreciates the interdepartmental cooperation.  She believes RTD is moving away from the silo effect that so many organizations struggle with.  She asked if staff would consider adding weather to the model.  Director Folska said that she knows when the weather is good a lot of people do not ride the Mall shuttle so she thinks this is important to look at.  Lee Cryer stated that staff is not aware of a direct correlation between weather and ridership.  He said that adding weather as a variable is something staff can look into.

Director Hoy shared that he uses regression analysis in his business on a daily basis and recognizes it is not something you can hang your hat on.  He wondered what other variables staff considered but did not use in the model.  Lee Cryer shared that one variable was unemployment rate as the number of jobs was a better variable.  He said another variable staff looked at but did not use was fare paid.  Staff calculated the average fare paid across all services and types of media; the average fare paid has been going up and so has ridership, which seems counterintuitive.

Director Lubow thanked staff for putting this together.  She noted the projected ridership increase of 2.8% but a more precise evaluation shows that it is really lower.  She wonders what consequences there are for the differences and how the Board deals with these new projections.  She also wonders if it will have any impact on the budget.  General Manager Washington stated it was up to the Board to decide how to proceed.  There is an approved ridership goal that was not based on good methodology.  He said the Board has to decide to move forward with the goal that was approved or a new goal that is based on better methodology.  General Manager Washington informed the Board that this does not affect the budget.

Director Lubow reiterated that is does not seem like the ridership goal was based on reality in the past.  General Manager Washington noted that this is one goal out of 81, so while this goal may have been off it is not fair to say all the goals are not good.  He stated that staff would still strive to do what they can to increase ridership.

Director James commented that it is useful to distinguish between a goal, which is something RTD can aspire to, versus a projection.  He noted that the Board just approved moving forward the 2014 Recommended Budget that has farebox revenue increasing by about 3% whereas ridership is projected to increase by 0.6% based on the new model.  Director James asked for an explanation of the difference between ridership and fare box revenue.  It is his understanding that ridership is the number boardings.  General Manager Washington agreed with Director James about goals and projections.  He said that over the years ridership was projected without proper methodology.  General Manager Washington stated that now RTD has proper methodology so it is up to the Board to determine what we do with it.  Lee Cryer stated that Director James was correct about ridership and fare box revenue.

Director James encouraged staff to look at reconciling ridership and fare box revenue.  He wonders how staff plans to achieve our aspirational goal.  General Manager Washington stated that one tactical plan is the Fare Task Force to simplify media.  Another is making sure people know how to ride the system.  He said there are a number of things staff can do.  Terry Howerter noted that ridership is based on the number of boardings while there are many variables that go into the fare side.

Chair Anderson thinks this predictor could be used in times of tight budgets; however, if RTD is looking at aspiring to build ridership the goal can be whatever the Board wants it to be.  She stated that she has no feelings one way or the other as to changing the ridership goal for next year.

Director Lasater commented that the model is really talking about things that are external to RTD while a goal is something RTD controls.  He does not think a projection should change RTD’s goal setting process.  RTD Needs to affect what happens by promoting better service, introducing new buses, etc.  Director Lasater cautioned the other Board members not to get too concerned about external controls versus the goals of the agency that can be affected.

Director Folska commented that the number of riders is important since often times it is tied to RTD’s funding from FTA, DOE, etc.; RTD cannot get funding if we cannot show we have the ridership.  She believes increasing ridership will also help RTD with funding.  General Manager Washington stated that these were two different things.  When building a rail line and completing the EIS staff is looking at projected ridership over many years, not just looking at increased ridership for 2014.

Director Tobiassen noted that the only variable controlled by RTD is vehicle hours.  He said he is surprised with all the vehicle hours that have been added with the West line the model only shows an increase of 0.6%.  Director Tobiassen also does not see fare being a determining factor when other models have shown ridership dropping as fares were raised.  Lee Cryer reiterated that the price of gas being forecasted to go down is really a driving factor.  Terry Howerter stated that the last time RTD had a fare increase there was also in increase in the cost of fuel.  He shared that he has always through fuel and ridership were more correlated than anything else.  Bruce Abel said that as part of the Fiscal Sustainability Task Force’s elasticity models many theories were thrown out the window because ridership was more highly correlated with fuel than fares.

Director Tobiassen stated that while we really cannot influence the big picture it would be great to track the effectiveness of our targeted programs to see if we can increase ridership in a specific group.

Director Bagley commented that in reviewing the dashboard that will be presented next, year-to-date bus ridership is down 1.1% and light rail is down 1.8%; however, in looking at the total revenue service boardings it is up 1.6%.  He said that as we open the East, Gold, North Metro and I-225 lines these will be major aspects that drive ridership up further because it will provide more, and different, service.  Director Bagley stated that this one out of 81 performance measures.  He thinks it is great what staff has done to look at this statistically but thinks the Board should leave the process as is for the time being and monitor the model compared to actual ridership on a quarterly basis.  He does not want to make any grandiose changes in what the Board and staff are doing until everyone has had a chance to analyze this more.

Committee Chair Walker stated that he is not crazy about the goal of increasing ridership because he does not think that is RTD’s mission; it is to provide good service to the community.  He said he does admire Lee Cryer’s work.  Committee Chair Walker share that he had done modeling in the past and understands that it is difficult to measure because there are so many external influences.
