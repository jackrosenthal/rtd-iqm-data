Motion:

Director Lasater made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the November 26, 2013
Board meeting.
Director Bagley seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Terry Howerter, Chief Financial Officer, stated that his team
will be presenting to the Board the final 2014 Recommended

Budget. He noted that this item has been briefed to the Board
over the last several months.
Jannette Scarpino, Manager of Budget and Financial Analysis,
reminded the Board that they began reviewing the 2014-2016
Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) in April. It was approved in July
along with the expense and capital project plan. Jannette
Scarpino said that staff began the review process of the 2014
Recommended Budget in August and presented drafts in
September and October. She noted that the Board has had
the opportunity to comment and provide input throughout the
process.
Jannette Scarpino reviewed the Board Report and associated
attachments with the Board that are available in the November
19, 2013 Financial Administration and Audit Committee
Agenda Packet.
Director Sisk noted that diesel is budgeted at $3.26 per gallon
and gasoline is budgeted at $3.54 per gallon. He requested
staff prepare figures that would reflect the prices if we did a
fuel lock today. He thought it would have an impact on the
budget. Jannette Scarpino stated that it would have a
favorable impact on the budget. She said staff would put the
numbers together.
Director Deadwyler commented that there are a lot of base
system reductions. She asked if that would mean there are
going to be service reductions in 2014. Jannette Scarpino
explained that these are largely one time changes that
occurred in 2013 but will not occur in 2014; they are not
necessarily a reduction in operating expense. She stated this
decrease is largely due to a $11 million Denver Union Station
contribution that was budgeted in 2013, reduction in DBA
expenses and reduction in grant pass through.
Director Tobiassen asked for clarification on the negative
adjustment of $9 million for the Downtown Circulator.
Jannette Scarpino explained that this is showing the
reconciliation between the amended budget from 2013 and
the recommended budget from 2014. She stated that the
project was likely over budgeted in 2013 but as we get further
into the projects staff gets better at the estimates/projections.

Director Solano asked why Stapleton was listed separately
under Attachment B, Reconciliation of Changes. Jannette
Scarpino explained that this is also a reconciliation from 2013
to 2014 in terms of new capital. This item was brought
forward for Board Approval to add $2.7 million to Stapleton
earlier in 2013.

• Annual Report to the Board - Interest Rate Swap Policy
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors approves the attached modifications to the RTD
Interest Rate Swap Policy.
Motion:

Director Bagley made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the November 26, 2013
Board meeting.
Director Lasater seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Brenden Morgan, Manager of Debt and Investments, stated
that at this time staff is not anticipating the need to enter a
swap agreement at any point in the foreseeable future. He
said that based on this, staff is recommending that the Board
does not need to review the policy on an annual basis; the
Board will need to review the policy if the District is involved
in or planning to enter a swap agreement. Brenden Morgan
noted there are some additional language changes being
recommended to clarify the Policy and to reflect the
implementation of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
Consumer Protection that are outlined an the redline draft
included in November 19, 2013 Financial Administration and
Audit Committee Agenda Packet.
Director Tobiassen noted that not too long ago RTD got
burned by some interest rate swaps. He thinks it is good to
not get involved in swaps any time soon. Director Tobiassen

also noted that the E-470 Board also got into situations with
swaps that cost them a lot of money. He believes these seem
like one of the riskiest investments. Director Tobiassen
wonders why we might want to do interest rate swaps in the
future. Terry Howerter stated there are many reasons to do
interest rate swaps; for example, if RTD had a fixed rate that
was high and the market is low we may want to go to a lower
rate. He commented that all of RTD’s debt is at fixed rates
currently. Staff has refinanced all our debt to very low rates
so we would not want to do any swaps at this time.
Director Bagley said that the previous swaps that may have
gone against RTD were created during the downturn. He
stated that we are in a totally different environment today.
Director Bagley believes it is prudent to have this as part of
RTD’s policy; this permits staff to come back to the Board and
make a suggestion should it be necessary. Terry Howerter
stated that he agrees with Director Bagley. He recommends
keeping a swap policy in place. He said if staff should deem it
reasonable they would bring the policy and present proposal to
the Board at that time.
Director Sisk asked for staff to clarify in the policy that any
swap would be presented to the Board before it is entered.
Brenden Morgan stated that was the intent so staff would
review the language to make it clearer before the Board
meeting on November 26, 2013.

• 2014 Internal Audit Plan
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors approves the proposed plan of internal audits to be
performed in 2014.
Motion:

Director Folska made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the November 26, 2013
Board meeting.

Director Deadwyler seconded the motion.
Discussion:

Ann Marie Isaac-Heslop, Manager of Internal Audit, noted that
staff had requested comments or suggestions from the Board
on the plan but no responses had been received.
Director Deadwyler asked if one of the audits was focused
around RTD’s computer equipment and software. She
wondered if that would be audited at all. Ann Marie IsaacHeslop said there were several audits that would touch on IT.
One would be CDW looking at the purchase of computer
equipment; there is also an audit of the Purchasing Cards and
check requests for the IT department. Director Deadwyler
stated that she is looking for an audit on the performance of
what RTD has already purchased. She said that she submitted
her request to the finance department. Terry Howerter said
that his understanding was that Director Deadwyler and Chair
Anderson were going to discuss this matter to let him know
how to proceed. Chair Anderson said that she has not heard
back from Director Deadwyler. She believes there is an audit
of Dataman USA LLC that might satisfy Director Deadwyler’s
request.
Director Lubow noted that in the presentation it states that
due to budget constraints there are no outside audits. She
wondered if this was standard operating procedure. Scott
Reed said that previously RTD might have used some external
auditors; however, previous budget constraints caused RTD to
begin conducting all audits internally. He noted that RTD
utilizes its internal audit department to do 20 per year. With
those audits and audits from various regulating agencies staff
believes there is sufficient oversight.
Director Solano asked if, based on the Background Information
Statement, the State of Colorado normally reviews RTD’s
audits. Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager of
Communications, explained that during RTD’s most recent
audit with the state it was recommended that in addition to
the General Manager the Board also approve the internal audit
plan.
Director Hoy commented that the list of audits seems pretty
well fixed at this time. He wondered if there was a way to
add or modify anything. Scott Reed stated that the Board has

not yet approved the plan; if there was something specific the
Board wanted to add or modify there would still be time. He
asked that the Board keep in mind that if the internal audit
team does find other areas of concern as they proceed through
the plan staff can always expand the audits or make
adjustments as needed.

C. Updates

• Third Quarter 2013 Internal Audit Report
Ann Marie Isaac-Heslop stated that the reports were available in the
November 19, 2013 Financial Administration and Audit Committee Agenda
Packet.
The Board had no questions.

• 2014 Ridership Goal Model
General Manager Washington reminded the Board that this model was sent
to them several weeks ago. He said staff wanted to briefly review the
process and answer any questions. General Manager Washington
recognized that there will need to be follow-up discussion on this; the Board
needs to decide if they will accept this methodology for the already
approved 2014 ridership goal or leave it as it was originally approved at a
2.8% increase.
Lee Cryer, Project Manager for Planning, shared that this was a team effort
among several departments. He explained that the statistical model that
best explains historical changes in RTD ridership uses a combination of hours
of service, employment and gas prices. This model forecasts an increase in
ridership of 1.3% from 2012 to 2013 and 0.6% from 2013 to 2014. Lee
Cryer stated the low increase for next year is due to the expectation that
gas prices will decrease.
Director Folska thinks this work is wonderful and appreciates the
interdepartmental cooperation. She believes RTD is moving away from the

silo effect that so many organizations struggle with. She asked if staff
would consider adding weather to the model. Director Folska said that she
knows when the weather is good a lot of people do not ride the Mall shuttle
so she thinks this is important to look at. Lee Cryer stated that staff is not
aware of a direct correlation between weather and ridership. He said that
adding weather as a variable is something staff can look into.
Director Hoy shared that he uses regression analysis in his business on a
daily basis and recognizes it is not something you can hang your hat on. He
wondered what other variables staff considered but did not use in the
model. Lee Cryer shared that one variable was unemployment rate as the
number of jobs was a better variable. He said another variable staff looked
at but did not use was fare paid. Staff calculated the average fare paid
across all services and types of media; the average fare paid has been going
up and so has ridership, which seems counterintuitive.
Director Lubow thanked staff for putting this together. She noted the
projected ridership increase of 2.8% but a more precise evaluation shows
that it is really lower. She wonders what consequences there are for the
differences and how the Board deals with these new projections. She also
wonders if it will have any impact on the budget. General Manager
Washington stated it was up to the Board to decide how to proceed. There
is an approved ridership goal that was not based on good methodology. He
said the Board has to decide to move forward with the goal that was
approved or a new goal that is based on better methodology. General
Manager Washington informed the Board that this does not affect the
budget.
Director Lubow reiterated that is does not seem like the ridership goal was
based on reality in the past. General Manager Washington noted that this is
one goal out of 81, so while this goal may have been off it is not fair to say
all the goals are not good. He stated that staff would still strive to do what
they can to increase ridership.
Director James commented that it is useful to distinguish between a goal,
which is something RTD can aspire to, versus a projection. He noted that
the Board just approved moving forward the 2014 Recommended Budget
that has farebox revenue increasing by about 3% whereas ridership is
projected to increase by 0.6% based on the new model. Director James
asked for an explanation of the difference between ridership and fare box
revenue. It is his understanding that ridership is the number boardings.
General Manager Washington agreed with Director James about goals and
projections. He said that over the years ridership was projected without
proper methodology. General Manager Washington stated that now RTD
has proper methodology so it is up to the Board to determine what we do

with it. Lee Cryer stated that Director James was correct about ridership
and fare box revenue.
Director James encouraged staff to look at reconciling ridership and fare box
revenue. He wonders how staff plans to achieve our aspirational goal.
General Manager Washington stated that one tactical plan is the Fare Task
Force to simplify media. Another is making sure people know how to ride
the system. He said there are a number of things staff can do. Terry
Howerter noted that ridership is based on the number of boardings while
there are many variables that go into the fare side.
Chair Anderson thinks this predictor could be used in times of tight budgets;
however, if RTD is looking at aspiring to build ridership the goal can be
whatever the Board wants it to be. She stated that she has no feelings one
way or the other as to changing the ridership goal for next year.
Director Lasater commented that the model is really talking about things that
are external to RTD while a goal is something RTD controls. He does not
think a projection should change RTD’s goal setting process. RTD Needs to
affect what happens by promoting better service, introducing new buses,
etc. Director Lasater cautioned the other Board members not to get too
concerned about external controls versus the goals of the agency that can
be affected.
Director Folska commented that the number of riders is important since
often times it is tied to RTD’s funding from FTA, DOE, etc.; RTD cannot get
funding if we cannot show we have the ridership. She believes increasing
ridership will also help RTD with funding. General Manager Washington
stated that these were two different things. When building a rail line and
completing the EIS staff is looking at projected ridership over many years,
not just looking at increased ridership for 2014.
Director Tobiassen noted that the only variable controlled by RTD is vehicle
hours. He said he is surprised with all the vehicle hours that have been
added with the West line the model only shows an increase of 0.6%.
Director Tobiassen also does not see fare being a determining factor when
other models have shown ridership dropping as fares were raised. Lee Cryer
reiterated that the price of gas being forecasted to go down is really a
driving factor. Terry Howerter stated that the last time RTD had a fare
increase there was also in increase in the cost of fuel. He shared that he
has always through fuel and ridership were more correlated than anything
else. Bruce Abel said that as part of the Fiscal Sustainability Task Force’s
elasticity models many theories were thrown out the window because
ridership was more highly correlated with fuel than fares.

Director Tobiassen stated that while we really cannot influence the big
picture it would be great to track the effectiveness of our targeted programs
to see if we can increase ridership in a specific group.
Director Bagley commented that in reviewing the dashboard that will be
presented next, year-to-date bus ridership is down 1.1% and light rail is
down 1.8%; however, in looking at the total revenue service boardings it is
up 1.6%. He said that as we open the East, Gold, North Metro and I-225
lines these will be major aspects that drive ridership up further because it
will provide more, and different, service. Director Bagley stated that this
one out of 81 performance measures. He thinks it is great what staff has
done to look at this statistically but thinks the Board should leave the
process as is for the time being and monitor the model compared to actual
ridership on a quarterly basis. He does not want to make any grandiose
changes in what the Board and staff are doing until everyone has had a
chance to analyze this more.
Committee Chair Walker stated that he is not crazy about the goal of
increasing ridership because he does not think that is RTD’s mission; it is to
provide good service to the community. He said he does admire Lee Cryer’s
work. Committee Chair Walker share that he had done modeling in the past
and understands that it is difficult to measure because there are so many
