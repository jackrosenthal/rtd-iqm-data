Approval of New Auditing Contract

Board Meeting Date: September 22, 2020

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorizes the General Manager to execute all documents necessary to award a contract to Plante
Moran, LLP to perform RTD’s independent audit and financial procedures services. The contract is
awarded for these services for calendar years 2020, 2021, and 2022 in the amount of $338,811.
There is an option to extend the contract for two additional one-year periods, at RTD’s discretion, in the
amount of $242,749.
This action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Mission-Oriented Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management
Task Goal #1 – Strengthen Transparent Public Communication/Collaboration
BACKGROUND
According to Section 12 of Article VII of the RTD Bylaws, “The Board of Directors shall cause an
examination of the District’s financial statements to be made in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards following the end of each fiscal year. One certified copy of said audit shall be filed
with the office of the State Auditor. The audit shall be performed by an independent Certified Public
Accountant retained by the Board of Directors at the sole discretion for this or any other purpose they
deem necessary. The auditor shall provide a signed auditor’s opinion as to the fair presentation of the
financial position of the District, the results of RTD operations and changes in its financial position for
the fiscal year ended. The Board of Directors shall cause such other audits to be made as it deems
necessary, utilizing the Internal Audit staff or independent auditor as it alone shall determine.” In
addition, the District is required by the Single Audit Act of 1984 and certain debt and lease covenants to
have an independent audit of other selected information. Additional services include an annual review of
information provided for the National Transit Database as well as a review of the General Manager’s
contract.

DISCUSSION
The current RTD contract for these services expires on September 30, 2020 with RubinBrown, LLC
having provided these services to RTD for the past several years. Due to the expiration of this contract,
a request for proposals was issued in which six proposals were received. The proposals were scored
40% for the qualifications of staff, 30% for the qualifications of the firm and 30% for cost. Plante
Moran was determined to offer the best value of the proposals received.
Plante Moran is the 16th largest accounting firm in the United States serving over 500 governmental
agencies. With offices in Denver, Boulder and Fort Collins, the firm is the second largest single audit

provider and a member of the Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA) and APTA. Plante
Moran also has a national transportation practice group focusing on public transportation including team
members that serve on APTA’s finance and audit committees.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for this contract is included in the 2020 Amended Budget and will be included in the 2021
Budget and Mid-Term Financial Plan (MTFP).

Approval of Budget for Homeland Security
Grant for Bus Audio/Video Live Connection
Award

GM
Board Meeting Date: September 22, 2020

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended that the Board of Directors approve receipt of the Bus Audio/Video Live Connection
project award in the amount of $2,416,000 with no matching requirement. The award is from
FEMA/Homeland Security under the Transit Security Grant Program. Receipt of this award requires
establishing the project budget in Oracle and an increase to budgeted 2020 revenue of same amount.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Mission-Oriented Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services
Strategic Priority #5 – Strengthen Safety and Security
BACKGROUND
The existing audio/visual software on 800 buses and 30 light rail vehicles is at end of life, and the
support for the software has ended as the audio/visual technology in use will no longer be developed
and supported by the vendor. The purpose of the project is to upgrade the current fleet of Bus/LRV
network mobile video recorders to operate remotely accessible live audio and video systems. RTD
invested millions in existing infrastructure that is at end of life and if we do not update it will no longer
be viable. The video system serves as an investigative tool in criminal and civil issues. RTD depends on
visual/audio records to provide rider security, legal protection to RTD (from lawsuits), community safety
and overall transit safety. There are multiple potential risks if RTD does not maintain these security
systems with more effective solutions.
The grant will allow RTD to update the software for existing camera(s)/video hardware with a newer
configuration, i.e., the cameras and physical recorders will remain as is, but the recording software will
change to support live streaming. There will be no new hardware purchased; the solution will
accommodate current hardware and spare stock.
DISCUSSION
The award is from Homeland Security in the amount of $2,416,000 with no matching requirement. The
next step is to create the project budget and transfer funding into the project so that spending can
occur. Awards such as this that are awarded after the budget is approved need a Board action to
establish the project budget and increase revenue in our Oracle accounting system as there are no other
sources to fund the award.

1.B.2

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The financial impact is neutral as both the project budget and revenue are established for the same
amount and offset.

DTP Private Activity Bond Refinancing Consent

CFO/AGM,

Date: September 16, 2020

GM
Board Meeting Date: September 22, 2020

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to consent to the proposed refinancing subject to the
conditions described below.
GM Goals
• Mission- Oriented Goal #3: Strong Financial Management
• Strategic Goal #6: Move Toward Stable Financial Situation
BACKGROUND
In 2010, RTD issued the Private Activity Bonds (PABs) as conduit issuer and lent the proceeds of the
PABs to Denver Transit Partners (DTP) to assist in financing the Eagle Project. (See attached 2010 RTD
Board of Directors Resolution.) The principal of and interest on the PABs are payable by DTP pursuant to
the 2010 Loan Agreement. The PABs do not constitute an indebtedness of RTD. However, DTP relies on
TABOR payments from RTD to pay debt service on the PABs. The PABs are subject to optional
redemption (refunding) on or any date after July 15, 2020.
INFORMATION
Since the PABs may be refunded for a savings in interest expense, DTP has requested RTD’s consent to
the refinancing of the PABs pursuant to the Concession and Lease Agreement (CA). Section 10.4 of the
CA provides the requirements for refinancing the PABs. Specifically, 10.4(d) states, “The concessionaire
shall not implement any Qualifying Refinancing without the written consent of RTD (such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld or delayed).
RTD has met with DTP over several months to discuss DTP’s request. RTD has reviewed DTP’s financial
model for the refinancing and both DTP and RTD have discussed questions raised by both parties. At the
time of a refinancing, a calculation is performed pursuant to the CA to determine the Refinancing Gain,
as shown in the table below. The Refinancing Gain is then split equally between RTD and DTP. Pursuant
to the calculation, Limb B is paid to DTP’s equity investors and Limb C is paid to DTP.
The General Manager provided a Notice of Election to DTP pursuant to the provisions of the CA with an
election to receive an upfront payment to the extent an agreement can be reached between RTD and
DTP based on the conditions described below, subject to the Board’s consent. In the absence of an
agreement with DTP related to the lump sum payment, RTD would receive any Refinancing Adjustment
as a reduction in the Service Payments over the remaining term of the CA. DTP currently estimates that
RTD’s 50% share of the Refinancing Gain would be approximately $15.8 million received as an upfront

Packet Pg. 7

1.B.3

payment under current market conditions. This estimate is based on current interest rates, estimated
costs of issuance, DTP’s underwriters’ views on likely credit spreads, and DTP’s indicative credit rating
from two major rating agencies. The final Refinancing Gain would be based on market pricing for the
refunding PABs.
The key sources of variability between now and pricing of the proposed refunding PABs include:
(i) general movement in interest rates, (ii) change in credit spreads, (iii) overall supply and demand
conditions in the tax-exempt and taxable municipal bond market, (iv) outcome of the ratings process,
and (iv) the specific bond structure, including the potential use of bond insurance, that will be optimized
during the PABs marketing and pricing processes to produce best results.

Refinancing Gain Formula:

Estimated Value

Limb A: Discounted present value of net project cash flow, taking into
account the benefficial impact of the refinancing. Discount rate is
13.94% (the Base Case Equity IRR)

$171.87m

Limb B: Discounted present value of net project cash flow, prior to the
refinancing, i.e. not taking into account the beneficial impact of the
refinancing. Discount rate is 13.94% (the Base Case Equity IRR).

($129.35)m

Limb C: Adjustment for DTP to recover any negative impact to the Base
Case Equity IRR since Financial Close in 2010

($7.58)m

Limb D: External Professional Costs

($3.34)m

Total Refinancing Gain

$31.60m

RTD's 50% Share

$15.80m

DISCUSSION
DTP has requested to move forward and complete the refinancing as soon as possible. DTP provided
RTD with notice of a proposed refinancing on August 28, 2020 pursuant to CA requirements. If the
Board consents to the refinancing, the key upcoming dates would be:
•
•
•

September 29th: RTD Board meeting to authorize consent to the refinancing
October 27th: RTD Board approval of the key financing documents (resolution, indenture, loan
agreement, offering document, etc.)
November (tentative) or December: Marketing, pricing and closing of the refunding PABs

RTD and RTD’s financial advisor have reviewed the refinancing calculation and the financial model to
validate DTP’s calculation of the Refinancing Gain and DTP’s underlying assumption for pricing the
refunding PABs.
This action would give the General Manager and/or his designee the authority to consent to the
proposed PABs refinancing; subject to the following conditions:

Packet Pg. 8

1.B.3

1. The final maturity of the refunding PABs shall be not be later than December 31,2044;
2. The maximum net effective interest rate on the refunding PABs shall not exceed 5.0%;
3. The purchase price of the refunding PABs shall not be less than 98% of the principal amount of the
PABs;
4. The maximum annual regularly scheduled payments of principal and interest on the refunding PABs
shall not exceed $37.78 million;
5. The maximum aggregate principal amount of the refunding PABs shall not exceed $400.0 million;
6. The refunding PABs shall be subject to optional redemption prior to maturity no later than December
31, 2031, at par plus accrued interest to, but not including, the redemption date;
7. The amount of the Refinancing Adjustment (savings) received by RTD as an upfront payment shall
not be less than $10,000,000, to the extent an agreement can be reached between RTD and DTP;
and
8. The amount of the Refinancing Adjustment (savings) received by RTD over time shall not be less
than $13,000,000.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Accepting the Recommended Action would provide RTD with additional funds to balance RTD’s budget
for 2021.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Board of Directors

Date: September 17, 2020

From:

Executive Committee,

GM

Date:

Board Meeting Date: September 22, 2020

Subject:

Approval of Board Expense Reductions for
2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Executive Committee of the RTD Board of Directors that the Board approve a
motion to adopt the attached Resolution No. ______, Series of 2020, concerning a Reduction of Directors
Expense Budget Lines in Fiscal Year 2021 to Offset Revenue Shortfalls Due to COVID-19 Impacts
This recommendation is consistent with the General Manager’s 2020 Core Goal #3 - Strong Financial
Management.
BACKGROUND
Directors are eligible for reimbursement from the District for reasonable local and travel expenses
incurred that are necessary to the transaction of official District business. Out-of-District registration
fees for the first two sanctioned events for each Director are not charged against the Director’s
expenses and are instead paid for using Board Office funds.
In 2009, 2011, and 2020, the Board adopted resolutions reducing the Board members’ spending limits
on their local and travel expenses as economic downturns required a reduction in overall agency
spending. The ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and beyond necessitate additional
budget reductions.
DISCUSSION
For Fiscal Year 2021 only, the attached resolution:
•
•
•

Reduces by $4,000 the amount allocated to each Directors’ travel expense budget;
Reduces by $1,000 the amount allocated to each Directors’ local expense budget;
Reduces by half, to $12,750, the amount budgeted by the Board Office to defray the cost of
Directors’ registration fees incurred in order to attend out-of-District transit-related conferences.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Adoption of this resolution would result in an estimated General Fund savings of $87,750 during Fiscal
Year 2021. This amount represents a 49.4% reduction in the budget allocation for Directors’ overall
local- and travel-related expenses.

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT

Reduction of Directors Expense Budget Lines in Fiscal
Year 2021 to Offset Revenue Shortfalls Due to COVID-19 Impacts
WHEREAS, RTD’s Board of Directors consists of 15 elected members who serve their
constituents on a daily basis throughout the community, at committee meetings, study
sessions, and Board Meetings, and at the legislature; and
WHEREAS, each fiscal year moneys are allocated to Directors’ expense budgets to allow for
reimbursement of their individual local and travel expenses; and
WHEREAS, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a severe impact on both farebox revenues
and sales and use tax revenues; and
WHEREAS, though RTD has received a significant amount of funding through the federal
CARES Act, that amount is not enough to offset lost revenues, and considerable agencywide budget reductions are necessary both now and in future years; and
WHEREAS, physical distancing requirements, broad travel restrictions, and event
cancellations both locally and nationwide have diminished Directors’ opportunities to travel
within their districts to conduct business and meet with constituents and to travel outside
of the state in the exercise of their duties; and
WHEREAS, at the same time, remote meetings have offered the Directors the ability to
conduct business from home, thus minimizing or eliminating the need to travel to and from
the Blake Street Offices to participate in, and formally vote during, Board and committee
meetings during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic; and
WHEREAS, due to projected revenue shortfalls in 2020, the Board of Directors approved
Resolution 012, Series of 2019, and Resolution 006, Series of 2020, which reduced the
amounts allocated to the Directors for fiscal year 2020.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that for fiscal year 2021 only, in light of ongoing
financial hardships impacting the agency, the Board hereby reduces the following budget
lines:

3) The amount allocated by the Board Office to defray the cost of Directors’ registration
fees incurred in order to attend out-of-District transit-related conferences shall be
eliminated.

DIRECTOR REQUESTED AGENDA ITEM
To:

Board of Directors

Requested
by:

Natalie Menten, Director, District M

Date:

September 16, 2020

Subject:

Compensation Reduction Salaried Non-Union

Date: September 16, 2020

Board Meeting Date: September 22, 2020

Added to Committee Agenda as a Director initiated request pursuant to RTD Board Bylaws Art. VI,
Section 1(f). Requires formal motion and second at Committee meeting.
MOTION
It is recommended by Directors Menten, Folska, and Mihalik that the Board of Directors adopt a
compensation reduction package for the salaried positions within the following salary ranges.
Tier 1 – Reduce wages 15% for salaries $150,000 and above
Tier 2 – Reduce wages 10% for salaries $100,000 - $149,999.99
Tier 3 – Reduce wages 5% for salaries $60,000 - $99,999.99
Reduction is effective January 1, 2021.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #3 Strong Financial Management
BACKGROUND
The agency is poised to layoff hundreds of employees, eliminate service in areas of the region, and
spend emergency reserves to a balance that will only cover several weeks.
DISCUSSION
This compensation reduction is in lieu of staff's proposed furlough days (estimated 30,000 hours).
•

Furlough days create slower response time for customers, less productivity for the district, and
shift additional burden and stress to the employees earning less than $60,000.

The RTD Board has a fiduciary duty to reduce overhead costs in order to achieve a balanced budget.
These salary reductions are reasonable and responsible in light of our financial reality.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Estimated $5,435,600 reduction in wages and pension expenses.
ALTERNATIVES
1. To adopt the proposal.
2. To reject the proposal.

The second quarter 2020 SB154 ratio is 12.1% which is lower than the statutorially required 30% ratio. The low ratio is caused by the absence of fare revenue and reduction of taxes due to COVID.

(1) Variance is due to lower parts, suppliers and purchased transportation.
(2) Variance is due to lower labor, repair parts and purchased transportation.
(3) Variance is due to projects budgeted evenly across year but not yet started.
(4) Variance is due to timing of project expenses not yet incurred, many of which are grant-funded.
(5) Variance is due to lower outside security services costs.
(6) Variance is due primarily to timing of outside counsel costs related to litigation.
(7) Variance is due to timing of outstide IT services costs for projects.
(8) Variance is due to timing of outside printing costs for schedules, other outside services and special events.
(9) Variance due to purchasing card costs that initially get coded to this cost center until they can be coded to each cost center where they were incurred
(10) Variance due timing of hosting services charges for MinuteTraq.
(11) Variance due to timing of grant fund draws, particularly the Eagle P3 FFGA and preventive maintenance grants typcially drawn late in the year.

LiVE Update

CFO/AGM,

Board Meeting Date: September 22, 2020
Information

BACKGROUND
In 2018, the RTD Board of Directors approved a new income-based fare discount program to be
implemented along with several other fare changes in 2019. This new program was named LiVE
(pronounced as in “live your best life”) and was developed using recommendations from the Pass
Program Working Group and public input. LiVE fares offer a 40% discount from RTD’s full fare rates
for eligible customers. To be eligible for the LiVE program, participants must live within the District,
have household incomes at or below 185% of the federal poverty level and be between the ages of 20
and 64 years old. Other RTD fare discount programs apply to those that are ages 19 and under and
ages 65 and older.
In conjunction with the implementation of LiVE, the non-profit fare discount program transitioned to
new rules after December 31, 2019.

DISCUSSION
In order to use the discounted LiVE fare products, customers must be able to present a valid LiVE
eligibility card to bus operators and fare inspectors. To obtain this eligibility card, customers must
apply through the State of Colorado’s Program Eligibility and Application Kit (PEAK) website. The
PEAK website is the application point for several public assistance programs, and now also offers an
option to apply for the LiVE program.
Applicants who are enrolled in certain medical, food, or cash assistance programs and fall under the
income threshold for the LiVE Program will automatically be approved (“categorical eligibility”) for the
LiVE program if they choose to apply and fulfill the age and address requirements. Applicants who do
not participate in assistance programs may apply for the LiVE program as well. After an applicant has
submitted all required information through the PEAK system for the LiVE program and has uploaded a
photo, applications that were not automatically approved by the system are reviewed for eligibility by
Denver Human Services. Data for applicants who meet the eligibility requirements and have uploaded
a photo is transferred to RTD and RTD’s LiVE eligibility card vendor for production, mailing, and card
administration. Approved participants can expect to receive their eligibility card within about two
weeks of application approval. Applicants who do not meet eligibility requirements or do not provide
the required photo or information are notified by mail.

Packet Pg. 36

1.D.1

The PEAK application for the LiVE program became available to the public on July 29, 2019.

As of August 31, 2020, 11,346 LiVE eligibility applications have been submitted, 7,037 have been
approved, 3,387 have been denied, 911 are pending and the remaining 11 have been closed for other
reasons. Of the 3,387 denied, 1,960 were denied because of age, i.e. they were 19 or younger or 65
and older which entitles them to a better discount, 472 were denied because their address was out of
District, 75 were denied because it was a duplicate application, 74 were denied because the applicants
were already enrolled, 608 were denied because they did not respond to requests for a photo or
additional information, and 198 were denied because they did not meet the income threshold. Of the
911 pending applications, all applicants lack an uploaded photo.
The decrease in ridership caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the suspension of fare collection from
April to June 2020 have had a significant impact on the program. The number of approved applications
went from an average of 230 per week in the first two weeks of March to an average of 100 in April,
50 in May and June, and 110 in July and August.
The 7,037 LiVE participants enrolled as of August 31, 2020, provided a mailing address1 in the following
counties: Denver 3,415, Arapahoe 1,590, Jefferson 810, Adams 647, Boulder 307, Douglas 83,
Broomfield 29, and Weld 28. Note that some counties are only partially in the RTD District. 128
participants reside in the RTD District but provided a mailing address in a county outside of the District,
which is acceptable under the program rules.
From the implementation of the LiVE program through July 2020, we issued 540 LiVE MyRide cards that
were used for 12,600 trips. 2,430 mobile app users bought 29,900 mobile 3-hour passes and day
passes. Nonprofit organizations bought 122,840 LiVE paper tickets. We do not know how many
individual riders received LiVE tickets from nonprofit organizations since the number of tickets issued to
each client depends on the organization and the client’s situation.

In addition to going live on July 29, 2019, the following actions have been completed:
•
•

LiVE fares are available through RTD’s mobile ticketing application.
LiVE fares are available on LiVE MyRide smart cards. The cards can be ordered through the
MyRide portal and have been made available for purchase at RTD sales outlets as well as

nonprofit program.
RTD Operations staff and Security staff have been trained on the LiVE fares and eligibility
requirements.
Marketing, training, product readiness and communications activities have been deployed.
Step-by-by step instructions for applications as well as other materials are available
through the RTD LiVE web page. A LiVE Program handout has been created, printed, and
uploaded to the web page. The instructions and handout are available in English and
Spanish.
The LiVE application process in PEAK is available to applicants in both English and
Spanish.
RTD customer service is answering LiVE program questions and referring customers to the
appropriate parties for assistance.
Denver Human Services is verifying income for those not categorically income-eligible
through public assistance programs.
Denver Human Services is providing LiVE eligibility customer service by phone and e-mail.
RTD staff are performing quality control, making any needed adjustments for uploaded
photos, working with applicants if a better photo is required, and assisting customers
whose cards have been lost or stolen.
The livecard@rtd-denver.com mailbox is active and being utilized to communicate with
customers about photos and cards and to field questions. Community partners can request
printed LiVE handouts through this email address.
A feedback form about the LiVE application experience is available on the RTD website.
RTD staff have promoted the LiVE program and answered questions at community events.
Denver Human Services has provided information about the LiVE Program and application
at community events and to community partners and caseworkers.
RTD hosted live and webinar training by PEAK Outreach (Boulder County) for nonprofit
organizations that are interested in helping their clients apply for LiVE.
RTD has refined the communications plan for LiVE and is expanding outreach and
marketing activities.
The team has identified requirements for PEAK enhancements related to the LiVE
application and application processing.
Negotiated the scope for enhancements to the LiVE application and application processing
in PEAK with the State’s software vendor. These enhancements will include revised
verbiage in the LiVE application based on feedback. Due to the pandemic’s impacts on the
RTD budget, this project was put on hold.
RTD kicked off a broader marketing campaign about all fare discounts, including LiVE,
starting with in-vehicle advertising and social media posts. In June, RTD issued social
media posts for each fare discount. We also included information about the fare discounts
in the communications and outreach related to resuming front door boarding and fare
collection on July 1.

We worked with Denver Human Services to adjust procedures due to the COVID-19
situation. The LiVE eligibility technicians are processing applications and provide customer
service remotely while the Denver Human Services offices are closed to the public. In
addition to the online application on PEAK, interested individuals have the option of
applying by phone, at least until the offices re-open.
Executed an amendment to the intergovernmental agreement with the City and County of
Denver to add the services of an Outreach Coordinator at Denver Human Services. The
person in this new position will assist eligible riders who face barriers to completing a LiVE
application. We plan to offer this service at rotating locations throughout the District, for
example in homeless shelters.
Created new LiVE informational materials based on feedback by customers, Denver Human
Services, and community-based organizations. This included a comprehensive questions &
answers document and short videos with basic information, how to apply, and how to use
the program. Updated the LiVE website for clarity and ease of use and added the new
materials and a new “partner toolkit” area.
Launched a new round of communications about the LiVE program. This included issuing a
news release and posting the new LiVE videos on social media. New communications
about the program and partner toolkit were emailed to community partners and RTD
Nonprofit Program customers. PEAK Outreach and Denver Human Services disseminated
the information through their email lists as well.

RTD is working with the State’s software vendor and Denver Human Services to work out
remaining “bugs” from the initial implementation in PEAK.
RTD is evaluating next activities for the marketing campaign about the discounts offered
by RTD, in accordance with the LiVE/All Discounts Communications Plan.
On-going communications with organizations in the RTD Nonprofit Program about program
rules, the application process, feedback, and changes due to the COVID-19 situation.
RTD is working with homeless services providers to develop and implement a temporary
LiVE ID card. Organizations that serve individuals in emergency situations will be able to
issue temporary LiVE ID cards to their clients after the PEAK application is completed. This
will eliminate the wait time between the LiVE application and the ability to use the
discounted tickets for these individuals.
Work with the City and County of Denver to add the services of an application outreach
worker who will help individuals apply for the LiVE Program at partner locations
throughout the District.

Denver Human Services will start the hiring process for the LiVE Outreach Coordinator.
Create policies, procedures, and agreements for the temporary LiVE ID card described
above.

Prepare a program report for the first program year, late July 2019 – July 2020.
Finalize and deploy the survey of LiVE customers for feedback on all aspects of the LiVE
program. We will ask for information about demographics and income level, application
experience, fare products, and suggestions for improvement.
RTD will continue to refine communications materials and outreach activities.
The team will use participation and usage numbers as well as feedback from customers,
partner organizations, and RTD staff to consider further enhancements to the program.
This will include re-assessing which fare products are available for LiVE.

In order to limit RTD’s handling of personally identifiable information for LiVE participants, RTD only
stores the mailing address of participants but not the home address. In most cases, however, home
address and mailing address are the same or in the same county.

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT
2020 FISCAL POLICY STATEMENT

1. The Board of Directors may consider potential fare adjustments annually at the time
of the development of the Mid-Term Financial Plan. As part of this process, staff
will review potential fare adjustments to establish a fare structure to ensure that it:
• is understandable
• is implementable
• addresses equity including social and geographical
2. Fare or other revenue streams and cost savings should aim to achieve financial levels
equivalent to inflationary adjustments in fare revenue established in the Mid-Term
Financial Plan.
3. Fare policies will take into account the special needs of all transit dependent patrons.
4. RTD will avoid dependence on temporary revenues to fund ongoing services. Onetime revenues will be used for one-time expenditures.
5. RTD will continuously explore additional sources of revenue to help balance the
budget.
6. When appropriate the Board will actively pursue legislation that would help ensure
the continued accomplishment of RTD’s goals and mission statement. The Board
will support efforts to ensure that legislative intent is realized in allocation of state
financial resources to public transit. The Board will actively oppose legislation that
would limit or diminish revenue.
7. On an annual basis, staff will identify under- or un-utilized property and equipment,
and will make an ongoing attempt to monetize such property and equipment to
enhance cash flow.
8. RTD will contract with a qualified third party to provide sales and use tax forecasting
containing projections for the short-term (one year by quarter), mid-term (six-year
Mid-Term Financial Plan period) and long-term (30-year Long Range Financial Plan
period). The purpose is to provide RTD with expert economic analysis and sales and

1. RTD will endeavor to manage expenditures to achieve service levels that will promote
effectiveness through ease of use and improved travel times.
2. RTD will continue to look for and implement the most cost-effective and reliable
methods of delivering transportation services.
3. RTD will endeavor to maintain its assets at a level that protects capital investment
and minimizes future maintenance and replacement costs. See Asset Management
Policy RTD-AMD-PLY-0001.
4. RTD maintains a risk management program which will provide protection against loss
and mitigate exposure to liability.
5. A safety program will be maintained to minimize RTD's exposure to liability and
thereby reduce the number of claims against RTD. RTD will invest in safety outreach
programs and personnel to communicate safety messages.
6. RTD will develop service changes that are needed to respond to budget shortfalls
using the system-wide and route-specific productivity measures that have been
approved by the Board.

CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT POLICIES
1. On an annual basis, RTD will prepare and update a six-year Mid-Term Financial Plan
including projected capital construction and improvements, service levels, operating
costs, and revenues to fund the capital and operating programs. Capital projects to
be included in the Mid-Term Financial Plan will be evaluated using the following
criteria:

total project cost (design and construction) and schedule for completion;
source of funding;
operating and maintenance costs for the remainder of the Mid-Term Financial Plan
period;
benefits and contributions to RTD and the community, including but not limited
to the effect on future operating and maintenance costs, economy, service, and
ridership;
consideration of alternatives (joint development, etc.); consequences of not
funding; and
RTD mission statement elements, Board strategic goals, and other relevant
criteria.

2. Priority will be given to replacement of existing assets before consideration of new
assets except as allowed for in the FasTracks Mid-Term Financial Plan and/or Long
Range Financial Plan (see #7 below).
3. RTD will use the first year capital program from the adopted Mid-Term Financial Plan
as the basis for the capital program to be included in the annual budget.
4. After completion of design of a capital project, cost estimates will be revised. If the
cost estimates exceed Delegation of Authority limits, the project will be brought to
the Board for reconsideration.
5. Facilities will be designed using current technology and allow for future technological
changes in order to be efficient and cost-effective and to protect the public welfare.
6. RTD shall allow for multi-year capital projects to be carried forward in accordance
with the carry-forward resolution adopted by the Board.
7. RTD will prepare an annual update of the Mid-Term Financial Plan incorporating the
actual costs incurred and the most recent available projections of capital
improvement costs, service levels, and operating costs and revenues to fund the
FasTracks capital and operating programs.

FUND BALANCE POLICIES
1. RTD will strive to maintain a fund balance in the Base System and FasTracks to
provide for unanticipated expenditures of a nonrecurring nature, to meet unexpected
increases in costs or to mitigate service disruptions as a result of economic
downturns affecting revenue. The Base System should strive to maintain a total
fund balance at an amount approximately equal to three months of Base System
operating expenses excluding depreciation among the following three reserve funds:

Attachment: 2020 Fiscal Policy Statement (4332 : Fiscal Policy)

•
•

1.D.2.a

Fiscal Policy Statement - effective October 29, 2019

the Board-appropriated fund, the unrestricted operating reserve, and the remaining
unrestricted fund balance. For FasTracks, the total of the Board-appropriated fund
and unrestricted fund balance should be maintained at an amount approximately
equal to three months of FasTracks operating expenses excluding depreciation. RTD
will consider and pursue resources that will be directed to fund balance
replenishment. For example, non-recurring revenues and budget surpluses are an
especially appropriate source for replenishing fund balance.

2. In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will designate a Board-appropriated
fund balance on an annual basis. Use of the fund balance will be minimized and
occur only in specific circumstances such as economic downturns. With Board
approval, these funds may be used to avoid cash flow interruptions, reduce the need
for short-term borrowing, and assist in maintaining an investment-grade bond rating.
The source of replenishment of this fund will be identified and replenishment will
take place in a prompt manner.
3. In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will designate a capital replacement
fund on an annual basis. With Board approval, these funds will be used for scheduled
major vehicle replacements and other capital purchases.
The source of
replenishment of this fund will be identified and replenishment will take place in a
prompt manner.
4. In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will designate an unrestricted operating
reserve on an annual basis. Use of the fund balance will be to mitigate service or
project disruptions due to revenue fluctuations, unanticipated expenditures of a
nonrecurring nature, or to avoid cash flow disruptions. The source of replenishment
of this fund will be identified and replenishment will take place in a prompt manner.
5. RTD will maintain an emergency (TABOR) reserve equal to three percent of nonFederal revenues, as specified by Article X, Section 20 of the Colorado Constitution.
6. The Board shall establish a reserve for future construction under the FasTracks plan:
• The FasTracks Management Reserve will be appropriated at a sufficient level each
year to fund adjustments to the FasTracks construction schedule, relating to
logistics or cost savings opportunities that might arise after the annual budget is
adopted, and will not be used to fund the (non-FasTracks) Base System capital
or operating activity.
7. The FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) will be used to provide funding to
complete and operate additional FasTracks projects. Expenditures from the FISA will
be subject to Board approval. Funding of the FISA will be provided from the sources
4
Packet Pg. 45

RTD will replenish fund balances as soon as economic conditions allow.

1.D.2.a

identified in the Board approved Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM) and other sources
approved by the Board.
8. All other FasTracks funds which have not been appropriated, or otherwise
designated as reserved, in the current budget year will be maintained in a reserve for
future FasTracks capital and operating expenditures and will not be used to fund the
(non-FasTracks) Base System expenditures.

1. Debt financing will not be issued to support operating expenditures.
2. Capital projects funded through the issuance of bonds, Certificates of Participation
(COPs) or other financial obligations shall be financed for a period not to exceed the
lesser of the expected useful life of the asset or a maximum of 40 years.
3. Effective communication with credit rating agencies will be maintained, and a policy
of full disclosure on every financial report and official statement will be followed.
4. Before long-term debt is issued, the impact of debt service on total annual
expenditures and the net revenue coverage ratio will be analyzed.
5. It is the intent of RTD to maintain a high quality investment-grade credit rating. The
benefit of maintaining RTD's credit ratings at the highest reasonably attainable level
in light of current economic conditions and availability of capital funding is to receive
lower interest rates and lower debt insurance premiums than would be possible with
lower credit ratings. RTD’s current ratings are listed below:

expenditure plan that includes projections of annual service growth plus allowances
for operating costs of new capital assets.
