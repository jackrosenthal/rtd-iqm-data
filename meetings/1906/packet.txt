B. Recommended Actions
C. Updates

 RTD/DDP/DUSPA Collaboration - Tami Door/Elbra Wedgeworth
Committee Chair Folska welcomed Tamara Door, President and CEO of the
Denver Downtown Partnership (DDP) and Elbra Wedgeworth, DDP Chair.
They gave an overview of who the partnership is, what they do, and what
they do in collaboration with other entities. Among items discussed were
the different collaborations with RTD and Denver Union Station Project
Authority (DUSPA), including the 16th St. Mall and Mall Ride, FasTracks,
Wynkoop Plaza and Denver Union Station (DUS).
Director Hoy asked to get a copy of the presentation. Ms. Wedgeworth
confirmed that the Board Office staff has a copy.
Director Bagley thanked DDP for their part in this complex relationship.
DDP/RTD collaborative work demonstrates what can be done when groups
sit down and exchange ideas.
Director James said it was a pleasure working with DDP in the past and
looks forward to working in the future with the DUS plazas.
Director Rivera-Malpiede thanked DDP for having their door open and
congratulated them on their outstanding staff.

6.A

Director Deadwyler thanked the DDP on their fine presentation and reminded
the staff to provide a copy. She also mentioned she doesn’t know the
background on the complicated history.

Phil Washington, General Manager, explained that the term “complicated” is
not used negatively. He also thanked the DDP on behalf of the RTD staff.
He stressed that when putting services together in Denver, it is not just for
the residents but also for the many people who work in the area. He asked
DDP if they had a percentage of workers that commute from the outlying
areas. Ms. Door referred the question to Aylene McCallum, Senior Manager
for Transportation and Research at DDP, who said that she would need to
look into the commuter survey for an actual number, but acknowledge that
the average distance traveled is 14 miles. Mr. Washington used this point to
stress the importance of providing services for Denver really means
providing services to anyone who visits.
Committee Chair Folska asked about the quantity of the kiosks and the rent
paid for them on the 16th St. Mall. Ms. Door deferred the question to John
Desmond, Executive Vice President of Urban Planning & Environment at DDP
and Executive Director at BID. He answered that there are 5-6 kiosks along
the mall with a sliding scale monthly rent of $500 to $800 depending on
location. Push cars rent for $300 a month. Director Folska asked if any
kiosk were planned for Wynkoop Plaza. Mr. Desmond said DDP/BID will
wait a year before making a decision on that. Ms. Door pointed out that
there is turn over on the kiosks since some vendors have grown into brick
and mortar locations. Director Folska thanked the DDP and encouraged
those in attendance to attend DDP fundraisers.

 APTA Legislative Conference Recap
Committee Chair Folska called for a point of order and asked the Directors to
please turn their phones off during the meeting as a sign of respect to the
audience and reinforcing the transparency of the available information.
Director Anderson responded as a point of order and stated that she was
using her phone in order to access the consolidated agenda as other
Directors use their iPad for similar purposes. She further commented on the
phone being another tool in order to perform the job on behalf of the
constituents and asked for a committee to discuss the tools allowed during
meetings. Committee Chair Folska asked that until then the Directors please
refrain from using the phones during the meetings.

Packet Pg. 5

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 1, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Menten asked how she could get a copy of the DDP and the
Downtown Denver Business Improvement District (BID) financials. Ms. Door
said she could make them available.

6.A

Director Anderson got up from her seat to show Chair Sisk that she was
viewing the Consolidated Agenda on her phone. She stated that she was
leaving if she could not look at an agenda during the meeting and would just
be calling-in. Director Anderson left the meeting at 7:55 p.m.
Director Solano thanked Committee Chair Folska for her leadership and
encouraged transparency during meetings.
Committee Chair Folska welcomed Sherry Ellebracht, Government Relations
Officer, to the meeting. Ms. Ellebracht noted that the APTA Conference
was covered during the last Board Meeting but left it on the agenda in case
there were any more questions or comments.
Director Deadwyler noted that she wasn’t present for the Board Meeting,
but wanted to thank Ms. Ellebracht for the organization of the APTA
conference.
Director Walker mentioned that the conference was great due to the quality
of the meetings and asked to pass on the comments to Patton Boggs.
Director Solano thanked Patton Boggs for their work during the conference.
Committee Chair Folska commended Patton Boggs on their performance,
including the prepared response for Mr. Washington at the House
Transportation and Infrastructure committee.

 Local Government Update - CRL Associates
Ms. Ellebracht introduced Roger Sherman, Chief Operating Officer for CRL
Associates, Inc. Additional analysis on the polling information related to
MPACT64 as requested by the Directors will be sent to the Board Office this
week. He explained that the analysis is not divided by Districts but by North,
Central, and South regions. He will be at the Denver Mayor’s caucus
meeting the next day discussing how the significant work in transportation
in the past couple of years has had an impact on how the Colorado

Packet Pg. 6

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 1, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Deadwyler commented that in the beginning Executive Committee
member Kent Bagley made the suggestion that Directors not have cell
phones in our Board meetings and it was decided by the Executive
Committee at that time. She does not think the Board needs to have a
committee to decide as she thinks the Board should adhere to the original
decision. She stated that when the Directors got the tools, i.e. the iPad and
Ultrabooks, it was decided that Directors would not use cell phones or be
able to text each other with notes on the system to keep everything
perfectly honest and everybody on the same page. Director Deadwyler said
that she thinks the Board should keep the status quo.

6.A

Department of Transportation (CDOT) looks at partnering with transit
agencies as well as how to continue the conversation and utilize this
coalition as the process grows. He also mentioned that Sue Horn, Mayor for
the town of Bennett, which is outside of the District, is in a recall process
due to her participation on the Denver Regional Council of Government
(DRCOG) and her perceived regionalism support for RTD.

Director Menten asked for a resource other than legislative counsel to get an
overview of how much Highway Use Tax Account (HUTA) funding has been
diverted to public mass transit in the state in the past 10 years. Mr.
Sherman replied that his team would have to look into it and that it may be
something DRCOG has access to. Director Menten asked for a timeframe
when the Board could expect the additional polling data. Mr. Sherman said
in the next couple of days.

 State Legislative Update - Brandeberry~McKenna
Ms. Ellebracht introduced Jennifer Brandenberry for the State Legislative
update. She mentioned there are 36 days left in the Legislative session as
they finalize the budget. Both the House of Representatives and the Senate
may have a bit of wiggle room of $12 to $15 million, but overall most bills
will not pass on due to lack of funding. There are no bills initiated by RTD
but a few do need to be cleaned up to negate any impact. The Honorable
Nancy Todd, Chair of the Senate’s Transportation Committee, is excited
about RTD’s work and has toured the I-225 corridor and the DIA
construction. Ms. Brandenberry also mentioned the proactive process of the
Northwest Area Mobility Study and how reaching out to local legislators for
one-on-one meetings has been successful.
Director Lubow thanked Ms. Brandenberry for the work with the legislators
as history indicates they are not often kept in the conversation.

 Federal Update - Patton Boggs (Sherry Ellebracht)
Ms. Ellebracht mentioned how overall it is difficult to create a bill in
Washington D.C. at this time due to funding and/or timeframe. There are no
new bills projected before the November elections and there’s not a lot of
hope for anything to go through during the “lame duck” session. The
anticipation was that HUTA would last until September but the new date is
July. Patton Boggs continues working on the DUS opening and are still
working hard to get Mr. Anthony Foxx, Secretary of Transportation, to the
event. Colorado State Senators Udall and Bennett have reached out to him.

Director Solano thanked CRL Associates, Inc. for their work.

6.A

Chair Sisk acknowledged the cancellation of the Transportation and
Infrastructure Committee Special Panel focusing on Public-Private
Partnerships (P3s) visit in April that was communicated to the Directors via
email and noted how this opens up time to concentrate on the DUS opening.
He hopes Secretary Foxx would be able to make it. Ms. Ellebracht said RTD
extended the invitation to the Congressional Committee for the summer.

Director James asked Marla Lien, General Counsel, if the RTD Board has a policy or
Robert’s Rules of Orders addresses the topic of the attention of members of a
committee or board during meetings, whether it would be documents, devices,
other people or anything else. Ms. Lien said she’s not aware of anything in
Robert’s Rules that addresses devices specifically. The general rule of a meeting is
only the person called to speak is speaking. Director James asked to confirm that
there isn’t anything in neither place that has to do with the attention of the
members of that board or committee. She replied that there was none that she
was aware of, even for napping.
Committee Chair Folska recalled that when Chair Sisk was elected as Chair he
asked the Directors to not use their phones during meetings. Director Solano
encouraged Directors to speak on cue and not using their mobile devices. He
emphasized the need for common courtesy. Director Rivera-Malpiede asked to
clarify the use of iPads during meetings, as she uses hers to do research on the
topic being discussed at the moment. Committee Chair Folska suggested a
conversation at the Executive Committee level and added that other councils do not
allow the use of electronic devices because it is not known what they are used for.
Chair Sisk agreed to take the mobile devices conversation to the Executive
Committee and since there is no policy on Robert’s Rule, the Board of Directors will
have to come up with their own policy which makes way for the Directors to be
informed while not having outside advice during meetings, thus developing trust
and not having Directors feel alienated. Director Daly asked Ms. Brandeberry about
the use of mobile devices in legislative settings. She answered that it is really up to
the leadership of the meeting keeping in mind that public meetings are public and
there is pressure for the members to pay attention and do their job.
Director Walker directed Director Menten to CDOT for more information regarding
funding of any agency using funds in any state.
Director Deadwyler mentioned how Mr. Washington is held in high regard in
Washington D.C. and shared that Mr. Washington and Jared Fleisher from Patton
Boggs assisted her by carrying her scooter up a flight of stairs.
Director Daly commended Mr. Fleisher on his support of Mr. Washington while at
Washington, D.C., even sitting beside him during meetings.

B. Updates

• Denver Union Station Project Update
Committee Chair James told the Directors as long as they are paying
attention to the topic at hand they have freedom to consult any tools.
He then introduced Richard Clarke, Assistant General Manager for Capital
Programs, Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager for Planning, and Bill
Mosher, Senior Managing Director for Trammell Crow Company (TCC). Mr.
Clarke and Mr. Mosher presented the last Denver Union Station (DUS)
update starting on page 4 of the Government Relations/Planning and
Development/FasTracks Monitoring Committees Packet for the April 1, 2014
Committee Meetings.
Committee Chair James thanked Mr. Mosher and Elbra Wedgeworth, Chair
of the Board for the Downtown Denver Partnership (DDP) for their leadership
and commitment to the community.
Director Deadwyler took a tour of DUS earlier in the day and expressed how
impressive it is. She noted that the bus concourse, which measures 1200
feet, only has one restroom facility at one end. Mr. Mosher pointed that the
restrooms on the other end are upstairs in the DUS main hall. Director
Deadwyler expressed the challenge this will pose for females and young
mothers as they would have to cross the concourse to have access to that
level’s bathroom.
Director Folska said that DUS is transforming the city, not just downtown
and thanked Mr. Mosher and Mr. Clarke for a job well done leading such a
complex group of people in such a long-term fashion.

Director Daly thanked Mr. Mosher and Mr. Clarke for their work and
mentioned he took a group of 40 people from his District on a DUS tour and
everyone was very impressed.

Director Rivera-Malpiede thanked Mr. Mosher and Mr. Clarke. She grew up
near DUS and is honored to have it in her District. She wanted to maintain
its hallowed ground sense as many families, historical figures, and soldiers
going to war have stepped through DUS as the heart of Denver. She
pointed out the role of women in leadership throughout this project and
thanked Ms. Wedgeworth for her leadership and support. Her leadership,
she said, adds to the thread of history and coming together as a community.
She noted how her Highlands community stops by Riverpoint to take
pictures of the landmark.
Director Bagley reflected on his participation as the Board of Directors’
Conduit to the Denver Union Station Project Authority (DUSPA) since 2010
and how Bill Mosher’s leadership as the owner’s representative has been
outstanding.
Committee Chair James noted the major projects and openings RTD has
planned for the near future and how these are sure to grab the attention of
the constituents.
Mr. Mosher recognized Terry Howerter, Chief Financial Officer and Assistant
General Manager for Finance & Administration, and Marla Lien, General
Counsel, as original RTD members to the DUSPA. He also acknowledged the
leadership of Ms. Wedgeworth as well as the City and County of Denver and
the Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG), among others.
Committee Chair James asked about the federal loans used to develop the
project and wondered if repayment would be accelerated. Mr. Mosher
replied that it is up to the City and County of Denver, RTD, as part of the
loan, is paid by FasTracks tax revenues as well as Downtown Development
Authority (DDA) tax revenues. The understanding is that the current City
and County of Denver administration would like to pay the loan as soon as
possible, but this could change anytime due to City policy. Ms. Lien further
explained that there’s a split in the DDA revenue and if there is an excess in
revenue it could be applied towards paying off the loan.

Director Hoy attended earlier in the day a Smart Commute Metro North
meeting and noted how Karen Stuart, Executive Director of the organization,
expressed ownership over DUS as a destination. She explained during the
meeting that money spent in downtown Denver benefits everyone in the
state.

Mr. Clarke thanked Mr. Mosher and Mike Sullivan, Alex Brown, and Rob
Andrews from TCC. Each one was presented with a plaque recognizing
their contribution to the DUS project.

Phil Washington, General Manager, told the Board the goal of this update is
to give a briefing on the May 9th opening including logistics, steps taken, and
other details. He introduced Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager for Bus
Operations, Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager for Communications,
and Jessie Carter, Manager for Service Planning & Scheduling, who
reviewed the DUS Bus Concourse presentation starting on page 29 of the
Government Relations/Planning and Development/FasTracks Monitoring
Committees Packet for the April 1, 2014 Committee Meetings.
Mr. Reed expressed the privilege of working alongside Tony McCaulay,
Senior Manager for Marketing, Stephen Reilly, Manager for Marketing
Communications, Pauletta Tonilas, Manager for FasTracks Public
Information, and Cheryl Holmes, Manager for Creative Services throughout
the Bus Concourse project. Together they presented to the Board the
communication strategy as well as the graphics already being used to
promote DUS and inform the public of the closing of Market Street Station
as well as bus route changes. As to the events leading to the opening, the
team invited the Directors to the Employee Day on April 26th and shared that
the sponsorships for the Evening Gala on May 8th, which will sit 1200
people, are sold out.
Mr. Washington briefed the Directors on the Private-Public Partnership (P3)
roundtables scheduled for the morning of May 9th. They will be educational
events wrapped around the P3 delivery model. With a capacity of 500
people, the idea is to have 3 panels: one from the public perspective, one
from the private perspective and one that envisions Transportation Secretary
Anthony Foxx interacting with the Workforce Initiative Now (WIN)
participants. Participants will include CDOT, RTD, FTA, AECOM, Goldman
Sachs, and Fluor, among others. Confirmed presenters and moderators
include Federico Peña, Mike Schneider, and Alethia Nancoo. Chair Sisk will
open the event and Denver Mayor Michael Hancock will close the event.
Mr. Reed informed the Directors that the Ribbon-Cutting Ceremony will be at
noon on May 9th. Mr. Washington added that the idea is to integrate
existing services as seamlessly as possible. He also interjected regarding the
potential opportunities being opened by the Free Metro Ride on 18th and 19th
Streets. One developer confirmed that they are planning an outdoor café on
18th St. because of the new service.

• Union Station Bus Concourse Update

Director Folska sees the opening ceremonies as an opportunity to train
constituents about RTD services. She suggested an educational voice loop at
DIA’s concourse shuttle and asked what other types of marketing are
planned and/or in effect. Mr. Riley mentioned that RTD is using outdoor
billboards, digital billboard in the downtown area, open ad spaces on buses
and trains, street teams from RTD marketing, public relations, and customer
service going out to various Park-n-Rides. Director Folska asked if bus
operators are equipped to make announcements and distribute materials.
Mr. Riley said that yes, those materials are available and that the street
teams will focus on the origination of routes affected by the changes. They
have also targeted businesses and HOA’s on 18th and 19th Streets. Director
Foslka asked if the team has tapped into the Citizens Advisory Committee
(CAC). Mr. Reed said that yes, they’ve been working with the CAC and
other stakeholders, such as schools, disabled communities, chambers of
commerce, Denver Business Journal, etc.
Director Bagley congratulated the team on a great job and noted the
employee event on April 26th as a great opportunity to spread the word
about DUS and the new services.
Director Walker, who rides the 0 Route every day, is excited to see how it
all pans out. He spoke with John Tarbert, Transit Police Chief Officer,
regarding security of the area and everything is in place for a safe and
secure opening and operation. He also noted how train passengers will arrive
at an airy terminal and how bus passengers will have skylights, adding to
the quality of travel of the constituents.
Chair Sisk congratulated the team on their mindboggling hard work. He
asked what would happen on Monday, May 11th, the first day for
commuters arriving at DUS. Mr. Riley said that RTD
Ambassadors/Employees will have a presence at the different stations two
weeks prior and two weeks after to inform and educate the public.
Director Daly asked what is being done to point out alternatives to the 16th
St. Mall Ride. Mr. Riley responded that the teams will be at DUS, Civic
Center, in front of Market Station, Park-n-Rides, different stations
throughout the Mall and Metro Ride area. Mr. Reed said that the total is
500 shifts and the process has been implemented at other openings.
Director Solano asked what has been done to reach out to the Hispanic
community. Mr. Reed said that materials are available in Spanish. Director
Solano said he was glad to hear that. Mr. Riley added that they’ve reached
out to various Hispanic publications as well.

Committee Chair James noted that the Civic Center Station was not
mentioned along the way and that he hopes that both Civic Center and DUS
will function as centers of gravity for RTD and Denver. He also noted that
collaboration between CDOT, DRCOG, City and County of Denver has
enabled the DUS project and have been the conduit for development.

C. Other Matters

Director Hoy asked how many people go through Market St. Station in a
day. Mr. Carter said 5,000. Director Hoy also congratulated the team on
the Employee Day invitation. He asked if RTD Ambassadors would be open
to public volunteers. Mr. McCauley said that it is best to keep it to RTD
employees as they are invested in the project. Director Walker added that
constituents already help each other with route information and he suspects
the same will happen with these new changes.

B. CAC Update
Committee Chair Hoy stated that he would provide a brief overview of the Citizens
Advisory Committee (CAC) activities. He said that the CAC has been finishing their
two-on-ones with the Directors. Committee Chair Hoy noted that the CAC’s
Arvada outreach went very well. He was unable to attend but understands they
had about 25 people in attendance.

C. Recommended Actions

• Approval of Funding for Light Rail Storage Tracks
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of
Directors approve funding for the construction of light rail storage tracks as
part of the I-225 Rail Line project. The storage tracks are estimated to cost
$12 million which will be funded by the overall FasTracks program. The
storage tracks are needed to add reliability to the entire light rail system.
Motion:

Director Rivera-Malpiede made to motion to
move this item to the full Board at the April 15,
2014 Board meeting.
Director Folska seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Austin Jenkins, Assistant General Manager of Light Rail, and
Rick Clarke, Assistant General Manager of Capital Programs,
reviewed a Power Point presentation with the Board that is
available in the April 1, 2014 FasTracks Monitoring Committee
Agenda Packet.

Director Anderson left the meeting early.

6.C

Director Folska stated that she will be voting yes and is in full
support of the recommendation. She wondered if this action
was already part of the 2014 approved budget or if it would
need to be included in the amended budget. General Manager
Washington stated that it would be part of the 2014 Amended
FasTracks Budget.
Director Folska asked if RTD owned the land and how large
the facility would be. She also asked for confirmation that
maintenance cannot be done at this location. Rick Clarke
stated that there was no land acquisition needed as part of the
recommendation. Chuck Culig, I-225 Project Manager,
explained that this will not be an actual facility but additional
track for storage; there will be a small building that the
operators will use to check-in with their supervisors prior to
their shifts. Austin Jenkins noted that all maintenance of the
light rail vehicles will still happen at RTD’s Elati and Mariposa
facilities. He said that the trains will be cycled for normal
maintenance.
Director Bagley commented that as we build the additional
extensions in the future the issue of all trains going to Elati will
only be exacerbated so he is very supportive of this
recommendation.
Director Tobiassen shared that he is very supportive of this
action. He said that it really makes sense with the path that
trains will take from Lincoln Station to the end of the I-225
Line. He feels there is really no need for all of the light rail
drivers to go to Elati and that this makes perfect sense from
an operational perspective.
Director Lubow stated that she will be voting no on this
action. She explained that she is not voting no because she
thinks it is an unwise recommendation but really due to a
larger issue this raises. She reminded the Board that she lives
in an area that is supposed to be served by the Northwest Rail
Line which there is not funding for. She expressed concerns
Packet Pg. 18

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 1, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

General Manager Washington stressed that if RTD does not
build the storage track the cost to RTD will actually be higher
in the long run. He stated that this action is another
preemptive action that staff is recommending similar to what
RTD has done on other corridors that will save the District
millions of dollars.

6.C

Committee Chair Hoy noted that the Annual Program
Evaluation (APE) process will answer many of Director
Lubow’s questions. He stated that it is an intense financial
analysis of FasTracks going forward.
Chair Sisk said that he too shared some of Director Lubow’s
concerns but also has to look at this from an economic
position. He stated that he can see the cost savings and
would like to stipulate that the cost savings goes back into the
FasTracks budget. Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager
of Planning, commented that the savings will accrue to both
FasTracks and Base budgets; the I-225 operations costs are
from the FasTracks budget so those savings will remain in
FasTracks. He noted that there will be some ancillary savings
to Base Systems.
General Manager Washington stated that staff would make
sure to show how the savings tracks back to the FasTracks
budget. He noted that if this action was not approved that
will lead to less money for the unfunded corridors.
Director Solano recognized Director Lubow’s point where a
proactive solution could create a reactive problem somewhere
else; he said he also sees Chair Sisk’s point about saving
money. Director Solano expressed concern that this action
might take away funding from the North Metro Line. He
stated that he was going to vote no until he was able to
discuss the recommendation further with staff.
Director Menten acknowledged that due to the change in Gold
Line technology from light rail to commuter rail it was
determined that RTD did not need a new maintenance and
storage facility and could expand the Elati maintenance
facility. She asked how much the expansion cost versus
Packet Pg. 19

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 1, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

about spending FasTracks money in such a piecemeal way
when the Board does not have the whole picture of what is
left. Director Lubow stressed that her voting no on this
recommendation was not because she did not think it was
wise to build, she is just very concerned that RTD is getting to
the bottom of the barrel for any funding for FasTracks. She
requested staff prepare a more detailed picture of what is left.
Director Lubow also asked for more detailed information as to
what is happening with the FasTracks Internal Savings
Account (FISA).

6.C

Director Menten pointed out that a reason for taking this
action now was a need to hurry because we have a contractor
working on the I-225 Rail Line that we could use. Director
Menten believes that this project would need to be sent to bid.
She expressed concern that it could appear there was some
favoritism given to the contract RTD was already working
with. Rick Clarke stated that the need to hurry comes from
needing to complete this before the I-225 Line is complete; if
we were to try to build the storage at that time the cost would
increase astronomically. He explained that RTD has a team of
independent estimators that would first determine a cost for
the project. RTD would then use that estimate to negotiate
with Kiewit to come to a mutually agreed upon amount. He
stated that if nothing could be agreed upon staff would
recommend that the project go out for bid. General Manager
Washington commented that this is really a standard
procurement practice that if a contractor is already working a
change order is negotiated with that contractor.
Director Menten stated that she would be voting no tonight to
ensure there could be further discussion about this item at the
Board meeting.
Director Walker feels this is more of a maintenance issue than
a corridor issue. This action protects the integrity of the entire
rail system. He stated that this is something he has also run
into in other situations where it costs money up front but will
create a savings in the long run. He shared that he worked for
an agency that was really focused on expansion of capacity.
Director Walker reiterated that this action was about
maintenance. He said that the other agency he worked for
now does not have the money to do anything whether it is
maintenance or expansion because they kept investing in
expanding.
Committee Chair Hoy said that he agrees with some of the
comments on both sides; however, the overwhelming thing
Packet Pg. 20

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 1, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

constructing a new facility. Rick Clarke stated that the
expansion cost between $20 and $25 million while the
approved brand new maintenance facility would have cost
over $100 million. He said in retrospect staff should have
identified the need for additional storage but was focused on
maintenance capacity and at that time I-225 was an unfunded
corridor.

D. Updates

• 2014 Annual Program Evaluation (APE) Status Update
Committee Chair Hoy reiterated that this will be a very complicated process
that will conclude in July; this presentation is just setting the groundwork
for future updates and decisions.
Rick Clarke and Bill Van Meter reviewed a Power Point presentation with the
Board that is available in the April 1, 2014 FasTracks Monitoring Committee
Meeting Agenda Packet. Rick Clarke highlighted that staff was not
presenting the Board with any overruns in the APE. He also noted that this
was just an update and the Board was not being asked to vote on anything
at this time.
General Manager Washington stated that no one wants to complete
FasTracks more than staff does. He noted that the current leadership team
took over when RTD had nothing under construction but now look at the
Eagle P3 project that came in $300 million under budget. General Manager
Washington noted that there is an undercurrent of suspicion that staff is not
doing everything than can which is very frustrating when they are working
hard to successfully manage our projects while trying to find innovative
ways to do as much as they can.
Committee Chair Hoy noted that there are currently six projects under
construction, half of which will be done by 2016.
Director Folska commented that bicycle storage was not listed as an
essential amenity as part of Phase II of the US36 BRT project. She thinks
that this is clearly important to commuters based on all the feedback RTD
and the Board has heard. She is encouraging and urging that staff look at

Packet Pg. 21

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 1, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

the Board is faced with is the question of if this
recommendation makes economic sense. He stated that if he
was the owner of RTD he would spend the money on the
storage tracks. He thinks approving this is a prudent decision.

6.C

Director Tobiassen asked if SB 208 would get a third party audit or review
before going to DRCOG. Bill Van Meter said that the FasTracks Citizens
Advisory Committee first reviews the documentation to make
recommendations. He shared that DRCOG often hires a third party financial
consultant paid for by RTD to review the financial plan; however, he stated
that this is not something DRCOG has determined if they will do yet.
Director Lubow asked if tax from marijuana sales could impact the APE and
funding for FasTracks. She also wondered how much RTD was projected to
receive from the taxes. Marla Lien noted that RTD just gets our regular
sales tax percentage of the sale of marijuana; RTD does not share in the
additional excise tax, licensing fees, etc. Committee Chair Hoy shared that
in January RTD received just under $100K from the marijuana sales tax. He
commented that the number could be attributed to opening day excitement
but if the figures hold it will be around $1.2 million annual. Doug MacLeod,
Manager of Financial Reporting, pointed out that RTD was already collecting
sales tax on medical marijuana; the figure referenced by Committee Chair
Hoy was for retail marijuana and was actually $99K for January. General
Manager Washington stated that all the sales tax received from marijuana
sales would go into the FasTracks kitty so RTD could continue to build as
much as we can, as fast as we can until FasTracks is complete.
Chair Sisk encouraged staff to think about Director Folska’s point that we
need to find a way to look at bicycle storage. He believes that as a multimodal agency we can find innovative ways to encourage bicycle storage
facilities and challenged staff to do so.

E. Other Matters
Director Walker asked and encouraged the other Directors to be vigilant in
reviewing the information presented to them over the next couple months. He
noted that on April 8, 2014 there would be a discussion about the Strategic Budget
Plan, an amended budget would be presented shortly, and the APE needs to be
finalized. He said there will be a lot of numbers presented to the Directors so he
hopes everyone can block out some time to really review the information.

Packet Pg. 22

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 1, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

including bicycle storage as an essential amenity. Rick Clarke stated that
bicycle storage is considered a betterment so it is outside the scope of the
project. He explained that the reason staff has been able to keep the project
in budget is by maintaining the scope. Director Folska reiterated that she
hopes staff would consider this an essential part of the scope of the entire
multi-modal system.

B. Recommended Actions

• Adoption of 2015 Performance Measures
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee
that the Board of Directors adopts the attached 2015 Performance
Measures for Goals 1-7. There are 23 performance measures in total.
Motion:

Director Anderson made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the April 15, 2014
Board Meeting.
Director Rivera-Malpiede seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Terry Howerter, Chief Financial Officer, explained to the Board
how every year his team brings the subsequent year’s
performance measures for approval, which serves for
benchmarking and guidance for the budget. He introduced
Jannette Scarpino, Manager of Budget and Financial Analysis,
who gave an overview of the report starting on page 3 of the
Financial Administration & Audit/Civil Rights/Operations &
Customer Service Committee (FA&A/CR/Ops&CS) Meetings
Packet for April 8, 2014. She welcomed Will Adams, Senior
Manager for Customer Information, and Bruce Abel, Assistant
General Manager of Bus Operations, to answer any questions
the Directors may have.
Director Lubow asked why the EcoPass Revenue in Goal 6.3 is
considered no longer relevant and if this means the EcoPasses
are not important. Ms. Scarpino said there has been zero to
negative growth and that it wasn’t of service to update on

Packet Pg. 25

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 8, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Anderson left early.

that item. Mr. Howerter said the EcoPass is not very sellable
but the FlexPass is and has better revenue. Director Lubow
asked if there would be something to report on the FlexPass
instead. Mr. Howerter noted staff does not report on any
other pass sales in the Goals so there was no intention to
include the FlexPass going forward. Director Lubow then
asked for clarification on the origins of the EcoPass report line
item. Mr. Howerter said that it was more of a tracking
mechanism than a goal. Phil Washington, General Manager,
interjected that John Tayer, former RTD Director, had
requested a report on the EcoPass on a quarterly basis and the
line item had no relevance to staff for measuring goals and
revenue.
Director Folska asked for clarification on Telephone
Information Center (TIC) and Customer Care. Mr. Adams
clarified Customer Information Division was renamed Customer
Care Division and TIC is one of the components of the
Division.
Director Solano asked for clarification on Goal 6.3. He
wondered if this is implying a fare increase in 2015. Ms.
Scarpino explained that this goal is set once the 2015 budget
is determined. Director Solano asked if there would still be
time to discuss a fare increase and Jannette Scarpino said
there would.
Director Lasater asked for clarification on the TIC estimated
time before getting an answer. Mr. Adams said the 75
seconds goal is from the moment the customer enters the
queue until they get an agent. Director Lasater noted that the
response time had gone from 75 to 49 to 49 seconds over the
last three years. He asked why not lower the wait time if the
goal is to continue to improve. Scott Reed, Assistant General
Manager for Communications, pointed out the expected
volume increase due to the many openings in the near future.
He considered it imprudent to change the goal at this time.
Director Lasater noted the goal was reached in 2013 with the
opening of the West Rail Line. Mr. Reed said the rest of the
year averaged out the volume increase for the West Rail Line.
The near future sees the Denver Union Station (DUS), US36
Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), Gold Line, East Line, and North Line
openings and staff needs to be prepared for the volume
increase to be caused by these. Director Lasater said this
didn’t make sense according to his experience implementing
Packet Pg. 26

6.D

Director Tobiassen thanked Mr. Adams for his work with the
TIC providing great service and the right answer 99.9% of the
time. He asked if Goal 4.2 referred to business or calendar
days. Mr. Adams answered it was calendar days. Director
Tobiassen then asked why employers would prefer the
FlexPass over the EcoPass. Mr. Abel explained the EcoPass
follows the insurance model, where an employer buys a pass
for every employee, receiving a deep discount. The FlexPass
was developed in response to employers asking for a pass that
can be purchased for specific employees within the company.
This product offers a lesser discount than the EcoPass.
Director Tobiassen asked if these are pre-tax purchases. Mr.
Abel answered that was at the discretion of the employer: pretax, post-tax, subsidy matches, etc., and the discount reflects
the choice of the employer. Director Tobiassen said the cost
saving benefits within this program are not clear.
Director Deadwyler expressed that by lowering the goals we
lower our standards of excellence. This should serve as an
opportunity to step up and ask what we are doing with our
staff to help them improve so they can meet the goals instead
of lowering them. She referenced the TIC and the day she
recently spent at the facility. She noted the fantastic job the
staff is doing and questioned if by lowering the standards we
are telling the staff they aren’t doing well. She also said that
she thought RTD needed to be staffing up for the openings.
Mr. Adams said that there are space limitations in hiring more
staff and that there is capacity to handle some additional
volume. He said the goal of 75 seconds is an average and he
doesn’t find it to be too high. Mr. Washington pointed out
how extraordinary the Customer Care team has been,
especially under the new leadership. Lowering the goal really
means anticipating the volume increase. If there’s a decision
Packet Pg. 27

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 8, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

programs in call centers as the 75 second goal has been
longstanding. He would rather see the goal set to RTD’s
average just in case the numbers aren’t correct and to give the
staff something to strive for. Mr. Reed assured Director
Lasater the numbers are accurate and asked if there was any
other information regarding the numbers to be brought to his
attention. Mr. Reed also said although staff survived the
volume increase in 2013, the openings in 2015-2016 are
unprecedented and the numbers presented are what his team
believes is prudent. Director Lasater expressed his
disagreement yet thanked Mr. Reed for his explanation.

6.D

Director Folska mentioned how her first interaction with the
TIC saved her life as they instructed her how to get to CU
Boulder from I-25 and Hampden. She asked for clarification
on when the 75 seconds started counting. Mr. Adams said
from the moment the customer presses 0 to speak to an
operator. Director Foslka said most people would go through
the whole menu. She also suggested investigating the
possibility of temporary support during the volume increase
and keeping the status quo. Mr. Adams mentioned temporary
support would be challenging as TIC employees are
represented.
Director Solano shared that he has experienced call center
outsourcing and wondered if this has been considered as an
option. Both Mr. Adams and Mr. Washington said outsourcing
has never been an option.
Director Daly asked if the proposed benchmarks of 88% for
Bus Local Services and 94% for Regional Services in Goal 3.1:
Maintain System-Wide On-time Performance were realistic
since the actual percentage hasn’t been close to the goal in
the past 3 years. Mr. Abel noted there were many reasons
these goals have been hard to achieve, including this growth
and unavailability of resources to meet community growth.
His team just completed a Peer Group Analysis of On-time
Goals and Performance. Member of the Peer Group include
agencies from Atlanta, Dallas, Portland, Sacramento, Salt Lake
City, San Diego, San Jose, Seattle, and Washington D.C. The
average goal for the group was 88%. The actual performance
was 81%. Mr. Abel recommended the Board approve
amending the 88% goal to 86% for local services and the
94% goal to 92% in regional services. These percentages still
exceed the goals of the actual performance of the Peer Group
Packet Pg. 28

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 8, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

to hire additional people then staff would have to look at the
cost benefit of increasing staff or balancing goals out. The 75
seconds benchmark was reached with some analysis,
reflection, and anticipation of what staff believes will happen
with the new openings. Director Deadwyler said she prefers
that the Board leave the status quo and reevaluate the
conversation as we get closer to the date. She asked if
anyone had taken input from those working the TIC as their
answers would be different from those in management.
Director Deadwyler also mentioned she would be willing to
take the conversation offline.

6.D

and still represents improvement from RTD’s actual
performance.
Motion to
Amend:

Director Daly made the motion to amend the percentages on
Goal 3.1 as suggested by Mr. Abel: change the On-Time Local
Service Goal from 88% to 86% and the On-Time Regional
Service Goal from 94% to 92%.

Discussion:

Director Folska asked for clarification on reducing the
percentages of on-time customer service and the possible
increase of fares in 2015. Mr. Abel said there was no
discussion on fare increase that he was aware of. On the
percentages of on-time customer services, he reiterated how
the goals have not been achieved in the past. RTD has
implemented training for operators as well as technology to
track performance by route to understand if a problem is due
to scheduling or an operator-coaching opportunity. Director
Folska said she would vote no until the 2015 fare structure is
more clear allowing the Board to make a better decision.
Director Anderson asked Mr. Washington to refresh her
memory on why these statistics were compiled and how they
are used. Mr. Washington answered they are not just for
meeting goals. The impetus is to be a management tool.
Goals dropping off can help target a problem. Staff has found
that even targeting, addressing, and correcting problems have
not allowed reaching the 88% goal. This prompts the
question, “what goal is attainable?” These goals are brought
to the Board every 3 months as a report. Annually the goals
are brought to the Board in April as a plan for the next year
based on what’s expected to happen. Director Anderson
noted she is uncomfortable with changing staff
recommendations since they are a tool for support and not for
the Board. She said it is also up to the staff to note any need
for additional staff and then bring that request to the Board.
She pointed out that the fare increase mentioned is not in the
documents. Ms. Scarpino noted the difference between fare
revenue in dollars and fare rate increase. She said there is an
assumed fare rate increase for 2015 because it is Board policy
to consider one every 3 years and the 2014 consideration was
deferred to 2015.

Director Walker noted the necessity to set realistic goals with
accurate measures.
Director Deadwyler stated the need as a Board to look beyond
goals and to have an option to work with unions and hire more
staff since turnover is high and we don’t want to burn out our
workers.

Director Menten asked what the turnover rate is at the TIC.
Mr. Adams said very low. He has only lost 1 employee in the
last 2 months.
Director Hoy clarified the amendment for Goal 3.1 as was
presented by staff. If the amendment passed, then it would
be included with the recommended action.
Marla Lien stated that the motion amendment being voted on was to change
the percentages on Goal 3.1 for the On-Time Local Service Goal from 88%
to 86% and the On-Time Regional Service Goal from 94% to 92%.

C. Updates

• Review of 2015-2020 SBP Development Process and 2015 Budget

Director Rivera-Malpiede asked how soon the $3.02 diesel fuel price could
be locked down. Mr. Washington answered that providers do not want to
lock down this early but there might be a chance since there’s constant
conversation on the subject.
Director Deadwyler asked how the Fare Task Force and assumed fare
increase would work together. Mr. Howerter said that the SBP is a 6 year
projection covering the cost of inflation every 2-3 years as well as capital
cost. He’s sure the Fare Task Force would take this into consideration and
finance will then bring a constrained SBP for 2015-2020 that will include
fare increases to the Board for voting. Director Deadwyler asked about the
possibility of the Fare Task Force recommending a fare reduction but would
be negated to account for inflation. Mr. Howerter said that it may happen
as there is a lot of work that goes with a fare change. Director Deadwyler
hopes everyone works together before it becomes a mess. Mr. Washington
said it was legitimate to ask about the timing between the two and staff
hopes to have the recommendation from the Fare Task Force in early 2015.
He noted the crossover between the Fare Task Force and the group who
would review the fare increase, adding that RTD has great interdepartmental
communication. Director Deadwyler encouraged staff to make fair
decisions. She also pointed out the crossover of committee members was
disturbing to her and wondered where their loyalty would be in making
decisions. Mr. Washington said as General Manager he would ensure the
process will be done the right way.
Director Solano asked when was the next time for the Denver Regional
Council of Governments (DRCOG) six year Transportation Improvement Plan
(TIP). Mr. Howerter answered it would be this June. This will be presented
at a FasTracks Monitoring Committee with other recommendation from the
Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS). Bill Van Meter, Assistant General
Manager for Planning, said DRCOG solicits updates every few years for the
TIP. Every time RTD has changes we bring them to DRCOG as amendments
so their plans and RTD plans align. Director Solano asked if RTD falls under
the DRCOG umbrella. Mr. Van Meter replied that any RTD plans that affect

Packet Pg. 31

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 8, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Assumptions
Ms. Scarpino presented the Review of 2015-2020 Strategic Budget Plan
(SBP) Development Process and 2015 Budget Assumptions as presented in
the report starting on page 15 of the FA&A/CR/Ops&CS Meetings Packet for
April 8, 2014.

6.D

regional transportation plans as well as any federal funding plans have to go
through DRCOG. Director Solano mentioned he would like to continue the
conversation offline with Mr. Van Meter.

Director Hoy stated the Fare Task Force is not charged with increasing or
decreasing fares. Their focus is simplification. Mr. Washington agreed and
said the goal is to simplify the fare structure considering the myriad of
passes. He said they may have some analysis that could impact decisions,
thus the question is legitimate in terms of timing. Director Hoy agreed
timing is critical and restated the Fare Task Force is not charged with
coming to the Board asking for fare increases; the process will be
coordinated, and the Board will be able to choose fare increases or not as
well as pinpoint simplifications into fare increases if need be.
Chair Sisk thanked Ms. Scarpino for her report and asked for further details
on the replacement policy. Ms. Scarpino said this methodology is being
implemented with Federal Transit Administration (FTA) support to assess
asset condition. These figures will then be taken into consideration with the
SBP request for each cycle. Director Sisk said this was a great way to
assess asset condition and is interested in seeing the process develop. Mr.
Washington added that RTD is ahead of the FTA with this implementation.
The program will be brought to the Board at the July Study Session. Mr.
Washington said he would like to challenge the warranty period and surpass
the MAP-21 requirements. MAP-21 requires the governing body to approve
the plan for the agency and Mr. Washington’s goal is to educate the Board
on the components so the Directors can vote on the matter.

• February 2014 Monthly Financial Status Report
Mr. Howerter introduced Doug MacLeod, Manager of Financial Reporting.
Mr. MacLeod distributed updated pages 29-36 of the FA&A/CR/Ops&CS
Meetings Packet for April 8, 2014. He also said the corrected pages will be
updated in the packet.
Director Bagley noticed the 2014 Year-To-Date (YTD) ridership numbers are
higher than the 2013 YTD numbers, yet they still are not reaching the 2014
budgeted numbers. He asked what the perspective on the rest of the year is
and if this is a concern that we will end the year not reaching our target.
Mr. MacLeod said RTD uses the Leeds Business School forecast which is
broken down quarterly. Director Bagley commented he understands the
issue and is not overly concerned but also mentioned even though the
forecast drives a lot of the information there’s also a budget to consider.

Packet Pg. 32

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 8, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Walker commented that DRCOG plans feed into regional plans,
which feed into state plans, which feed into federal plans.

6.D

Mr. Howerter noted the second quarter figures will be included in the
amended budget to be presented to the Board.

Director Folska asked if there is a way to guess an estimate on the
percentages asked by Chair Sisk the same way we are able to see the
marijuana sales tax revenue. Mr. MacLeod said marijuana retail
establishments and medical marijuana dispensaries are specific to that
product, making them easy to track. Mr. Howerter interjected that grocer
vendors, for example, file the 1% from all their non-edible sales but do not
break down how much of that one percent came from which kind of
product. Director Folska then asked how RTD can tell the tax collection
happens. Marla Lien, General Counsel, said there should be a correlation
between what the State collects and what RTD collects. Mr. Howerter
added State audits will also inform us that RTD is collecting taxes. Director
Folska asked if there’s a way to tell the change in revenue based on the
timing we receive the sales tax parity. Mr. Washington answered neither
RTD nor the State have the ability to break it down at that level and
perceived changes in revenue could be due to changes in economy and
people’s spending habits, among other variables.
Director Hoy asked if the new monitoring system will not be able to pick up
on those items. Mr. MacLeod said that is correct although there could be a
review of the supporting documentation the vendor puts together; it would
be a great task to track. Director Hoy then asked what specifically RTD
monitors regarding the sales tax or is it just from what the State collects we
collect 1%. Mr. MacLeod answered that it relies on taxpayer compliance.
The only way the State could verify that information is mainly through
audits. Director Hoy asked if RTD finds any taxpayer not in compliance then
our find also benefits the State. Ms. Lien interjected that another issue has
been the District boundaries since it includes 4 counties that are not fully
incorporated. Director Hoy then asked if the State still gives RTD a 1% if a
certain vendor pays taxes but isn’t reporting RTD taxes and they are within
the District’s boundary. Mr. Howerter answered that an audit needs to take
place in order for RTD to collect that tax. The vendor will need to submit it
to the State and then the State would remit the tax. Director Hoy noticed
the assumption of those not reporting taxes being along the District
boundaries, yet there may be vendors in Downtown Denver not reporting.
Mr. Washington said that it does happen and that adjustments are made
both ways throughout the year.

Packet Pg. 33

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 8, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Chair Sisk asked for more details on the impact of House Bill 1272,
establishing exemption parity on sales tax, on the January and February
numbers. Mr. MacLeod said we are not able to verify that information
because vendors file taxes by sales percentage and not by products.

6.D

Director Deadwyler asked if the Tabor Foundation is still taking RTD to
court. Ms. Lien answered we are still litigating and noted it is a long
process. Director Deadwyler then asked if RTD would have to return the
revenue generated if the litigation is lost. Committee Chair Walker called the
conversation back to topic and asked that any further comments be related
to the February 2014 Monthly Financial Report Status Report Update.
Director Deadwyler and Director Solano agreed to take their questions
offline.

D. Other Matters
Director Bagley noted the average use of the different parking facilities throughout
the District. The West Corridor parking facilities are not being used to their
potential and he would like to know the forecast on that subject. He mentioned he
made a well-received hour long presentation on behalf of RTD and DUSPA to the
City Club of Denver to a luncheon audience of 125 people. During his presentation
he referred to the development around DUS, dramatically showing the importance
of Transit Oriented Development (TOD).

Director Menten reminded the Directors of her public stance on House Bill
1272. RTD told the State it would get about $3 million in revenue from that
bill. Director Menten believes that an increase in revenue due to a policy
change needs to go to the voters for approval and not doing so violates the
constitution, which the Directors took an oath to uphold. She also
mentioned how the sales tax parity is supposed to make it easier for vendors
but instead it is full of distractions, confusion, and disruption of business
while the vendors are trying to benefit our economy. She called RTD’s
actions, including hiring an outside auditor to do the legwork of the State,
disappointing.

C. Updates

• Small Business Office Base System Update
Committee Chair Rivera-Malpiede welcomed Kenn Hardin, Sr. Manager for
Civil Rights, and Zamy Silva, Small Business Office (SBO) Manager, to the
committee.
Mr. Hardin shared with the Board that the purpose of the update was to
show his department is equally busy on the Base System programs as they
are on FasTracks.
Ms. Silva gave an overview of the report starting on page 37 of the Financial
Administration & Audit/Civil Rights Committee/Operations and Customer
Service Committee Agenda Packet for April 8, 2014. She highlighted the
areas of IT software and upgrades/testing/integration, concrete repair,
electrical work, consulting, construction, snow removal and custodial
services as the main specializations Disadvantage Business Enterprise (DBE)
and Small Business Enterprise (SBE) firms that have been contracted through
the Base System. She recognized Carnation Building Services, JCOR
Mechanical, Manion Construction, P&H Equipment, and Triunity as champion
DBE/SBEs that have exceled on the Base System.
Mr. Hardin further noted the SBEs are divided into four categories.
Companies then compete against each other based on business size and net
worth.

B. Recommended Actions

• Approval of contract award for Light Rail Training Simulator
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee,
to approve a contract to procure and install a Light Rail training simulator at
the Elati Light Rail Facility.
Motion:

Director Solano made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the April 15, 2014
Board Meeting.
Director Rivera-Malpiede seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Austin Jenkins, Assistant General Manager of Rail Operations,
shares that staff is very excited about this project. He
introduced Bill Bell, Manager of Light Rail Transportation, and
Doug Carrington, Project Manager and Light Rail
Transportation Supervisor, who reviewed a Power Point
presentation with the Board that is available in the April 8,
2014 Operations and Customer Service Committee Agenda
Packet.
Austin Jenkins stressed to the Board that the current ability to
train light rail operators is limited but this simulator will allow
staff to overcome some of those challenges. Bill Bell shared
that he and Doug Carrington visited Calgary, Alberta, Canada,
to view their simulator. He said at that time staff thought
they had selected a vendor but that was not even close to
what OKTAL could deliver. Bill Bell stated that while they

Directors Anderson and Hoy left early.

6.F

were in the middle of the price range of bids this product is far
superior to what any other company can provide.

“It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services
Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the
General Manager, or his designee, to approve a contract with
OKTAL in an amount not to exceed $1,543,500 to procure
and install a Light Rail training simulator at the Elati Light Rail
Facility.”
Director Deadwyler asked how long Calgary had the OKTAL
simulator. She expressed concern that we have purchased
technology in the past that was not fully tested by RTD then
ends up with a lot of mechanical issues or problems. She also
wondered how long the warranty period is. Austin Jenkins
stated that Calgary began using the simulator in September of
2013. He noted that OKTAL has also provided simulators for
the high speed rail in Paris and many other European countries.
He said that throughout his career he has had a great deal of
experience with simulators and he is confident that this is a
company with enough experience in the field that RTD will
have a good product with a company that will stand behind it.
Doug Carrington stated that there is an initial one year
warranty with a three year extension.
Director Folska thinks this is a wonderful idea. She believes it
really reflects RTD’s commitment to public safety. She asked
if the simulator replicates real life conditions, for example can
it make the operators stress out, sleepy, etc. Bill Bell stated
that the simulator will have a very realistic feel; it will look just
like the interior of our light rail vehicle cabs. He shared that
the scenery will appear as it does in our alignment; there will
be pedestrians and automobiles, and the seat will even move
as if it was a real train. Doug Carrington explained that the
trainers can create stressful situations that are very realistic to
what the operator might go through when they are operating a
live train. Austin Jenkins pointed out that part of the
simulator will be made by Siemens to include the proper train
consoles.

the Board to read:

6.F

Director Tobiassen commended the light rail team for moving
this item forward. He said that he was surprised that staff has
waited this long to purchase a simulator and only requesting
one. He shared that he has years of experience with flight
training simulators noting that what instructors try to do is
create worst case scenarios to get the operators prepared.
Director Tobiassen wondered if logs of training hours were
kept for each operator. Bill Bell stated that operators training
hours are tracked but the simulator will allow the training
department to keep more detailed records.
Director Bagley stated that he would be supporting this
recommendation. He is very appreciative of staff’s efforts.
Director Solano said that he will be supporting this item. He
noted that in his telecom work he had to do a lot of simulator
training so he understands how crucial training is.
Director Daly shared that he has seen many simulators
demonstrated at the various APTA conferences he attended.
He commented that one of the big problems with simulators is
that a lot of trainees get nauseous or dizzy. Bill Bell said that
he actually experienced that in the Calgary simulator before
the motion seat was turned on. Austin Jenkins said that staff
originally contemplated purchasing the simulator without the
motion seat to save money but were strongly encouraged to
add it for the realism.

Director Folska asked if the console was an additional cost.
She also wondered if there would be future software upgrade
fees. Bill Bell stated that the Siemens console was included in
the cost. He explained that staff did not anticipate needing
any software upgrades as the simulator is fully expendable
over time; staff expects to be able to use the simulator for
20+ years.

C. Updates

• August 2014 Service Change

Jessie Carter, Manager of Service Planning and Scheduling, explained that
staff has three goals for these service changes: (1) prepare for the opening
of Denver Union Station (DUS), (2) provide a larger maintenance window for
light rail, and (3) improve on-time performance and capacity issues. He
noted that while the financial impact is estimated at an annualized amount
of $315K there is actually about $900K of bus service improvements that
are counterbalanced by some efficiencies gained on the light rail side.
Director Deadwyler thanked Jessie Carter and his team for working with her
and the citizens of Green Valley Ranch to lengthen their service hours. She
shared that there were many complaints that the bus service stopped at
6:00 p.m. and people were unable to get home; now the bus service will be
extended to 8:15 p.m. and she expressed how happy the people in the area
will be.
Director Lasater asked for further information on the change in weeknight
service for the light rail lines, specifically the E-Line. He wonders if the
alternate bus service will get riders to the Lincoln station around the same
time as the train or if this change will increase their travel time. Director
Tobiassen expressed that he also had questions related to the H-Line. Jessie
Carter said that he would get with the Directors to discuss the changes in
further detail.
Director Menten asked what route times were proposed to be discontinued
on the W-Line. Jessie Carter stated they were the Eastbound trips from
Federal Center Station at 6:01 a.m., 3:00 p.m., 3:15 p.m. and 6:45 p.m.
and the Westbound trips from Denver Union Station at 5:40 a.m., 2:25
p.m., 2:55 p.m. and 6:25 p.m.
Director Solano asked why Route 120 in Brighton was being changed.
Jessie Carter explained that this is a permanent route extension that came at
the City of Brighton’s request.

D. Other Matters

2) Staff has been in conversation with Boulder County and the City of Longmont in
regards to the proposed fare buy-up program in which the City would buy fares
for the local service. He said that staff is also working with the FTA on this
item and will come to the Board with a recommendation to enter into a six
month agreement for the program. He noted that the goal is to kick the
program off in September as kids are going back to school.

April Board Meeting Agenda Review
Chair Sisk reviewed the April agenda for the April 15 Board meeting. General Manager
Washington noted we did not have any retirees this month. He also noted that there are
no items on the unanimous consent but three items on the recommended action.
Motion:

Discussion:

Director Tobiassen made the motion to approve the
agenda for the April 15, 2014 Board meeting.
Director Walker seconded the motion.
General Manager Washington commented that he
believed there was some confusion about the adoption
of 2015 performance measures. He stated that the
fare rate increase was not a component of this action
item. Director Folska responded that she was the one
who brought this issue up and understands there is a
difference. However, she questions us changing or
lowering the performance measures while later in the
same year having the possibility for a fare rate increase.

Chair Sisk indicated three things that could have been
clearer:
(1) The requested change in the performance measure
by Bruce Abel to lower the on-time performance and
the regional express time should have been made
earlier and information provided to the Board
members for them to digest prior to the meeting.
He requested a follow up memo to the Board on this
change and the rationale.
(2) It is not quite clear on the net effect of goal 4.1 in
terms of changing how it is calculated to average
TIC speed to answer. It appears that by changing
the point in which it is measured, it does lower the
goal.
(3) Board members were confused by the discussion of
impacts that come from 2016 openings when we
were evaluating what should be the 2015
performance measures.
Vote on Motion:

The motion passed with all committee members in
favor.
Chair Sisk declared this motion PASSED Unanimously.

General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee
Committee Chair Bagley indicated he would share that the survey monkey
survey would be sent out on April 15th. Board members will have the
window between April 15-30 for completion.
Director Folska inquired if the question of anonymity has been addressed.
Director Bagley referred this question to Chair Sisk for a response. Chair
Sisk indicated that the survey will be issued without reference to names. It
is incumbent on each Board member to respond in accordance with his/her
governance responsibilities on the Board. We will simply have numbers on
who did/did not respond and nothing else.
Director Tobiassen asked how will we know that the same person did not
provide multiple responses. What mechanism is in place to monitor this?
Paula Perdue will check with IT.
Director Bagley reemphasized that in 2009 the state audit had identified a
gap in the Board governance process when it came to the General

Packet Pg. 45

Manager‘s compensation and performance evaluation. As a result, we had
implemented a methodology to help better the actions of the Board and the
District that are more rigorous and requires accountability. This is a
movement away from that accountability.


Recommended Action

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors
approve funding for the construction of light rail storage tracks as part of the I-225 Rail
Line project. The storage tracks are estimated to cost $12 million which will be funded
by the overall FasTracks program. The storage tracks are needed to add reliability to
the entire light rail system.
B. Adoption of 2015 Performance Measures
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the
Board of Directors adopts the attached 2015 Performance Measures for Goals 1-7.
There are 23 performance measures in total.
C. Approval of contract award for Light Rail Training Simulator
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the RTD
Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to approve a
contract with OKTAL in an amount not to exceed $1,543,000 to procure and install a
Light Rail training simulator at the Elati Light Rail Facility.

III.

DUS Event Preparation
General Manager Washington invited Sherry Ellebracht and Adrian Mabry, event
coordinator, to the meeting to help brief on the DUS event preparation.
1. DUS gala event, May 8, 2014—General Manager Washington emphasized this is a
social event and not a RTD sponsored event. We are expecting around 1000
people to this event. The setup will be inside and outside of the bus way. There
will not be any speeches but a video will be played that loops around the theme
“Past, Present and Future.”
 Logistics—We will have high end porta potties and will have toilet bowl lids and
covers for the bathrooms. The temperature within that underground space is
about 55 degrees but they anticipate with the heat from the caterers and the
volume of people, the overall temperature will be comfortable.
 We are receiving comments from former Board members who are concerned
about the cost to attend this gala. One of the things we had settled on was to

Packet Pg. 46

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 10, 2014 12:00 PM (Committee Reports)

A. Approval of Funding for Light Rail Storage Tracks

use the NTP date of November, 2010 for the plaque to recognize current and
former Directors. This is also the date we will use to be consistent across the
Board. Everyone including current Board members have to purchase a table or
seat. Because this is a sponsored event and alcohol will be served, it is
important that we all communicate that this event is hosted by an outside group
“Ride-On” and everyone is expected to pay. Paula Perdue is maintaining a list
of the Directors who have called in but there is no assurance that tickets will be
available. Adrian Mabry indicated that approximately 750 seats have been
purchased by sponsors and approximately 89 additional seats have been
purchased from the invitation that went out to the general public.
 Other Concerns: Adrian indicated the dress will be business attire since this is
following the business workday and they wanted people to be comfortable.
They will be sending out a packet with more information around this and
logistics. The RTD parking lot should be available for Board members to park
for the event. Also each packet will have two free ride coupons for invitees
who choose to take our bus or light rail service.
2. P3 Roundtable Discussion—the doors will open around 8:00 a.m. They are
anticipating around 300 people. Chair Sisk will provide the welcome. The
breakdown of the panels:
 Public Partnership—Honorable Frederico Pena will introduce the first panel.
They will spend 45-50 minutes with this discussion. Mike Schneider, Chair of
the APTA P3 committee, will serve as moderator. Panelists include GM
Washington, Don Hunt, CDOT, Terese McMillan, FTA, and possible Claire
Dowdy with the National Infrastructure Committee (TBD).
 Private sector—Bill Mosher will introduce this as part of the transition. They
will have a moderator and the panelists include the companies of Fluor, Kiewit,
Plenary Roads and Goldman Sachs.
 Ladders of opportunity—this is a transition more to workforce challenges and a
discussion group with WIN participants. Secretary Foxx has expressed an
interest in this issue and will engage in a dialogue with four (4) WIN participants
on the DUS project. Director Rivera-Malpiede, Chair of the Civil Rights
Committee, will make this introduction. Honorable Mayor Michael Hancock will
conclude this session.
Comments from Board members:
 Director Tobiassen emphasized that P3 discussion has a statewide impact and it is
important that invitations/outreach be extended on a statewide basis. He noted
this was an important discussion at the E-470 Board meeting this morning. He also
asked Director Folska to comment on this as the Chair of the Government Relations
Committee. Director Folska stated she could not comment since she has not been
privileged to any of these discussions. General Manager Washington stated that
this is not a government relations event but an educational event. Director Folska

Packet Pg. 47

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 10, 2014 12:00 PM (Committee Reports)

6.G

responded that it is difficult to uncouple the political impact (i.e. state and
government relations) from its educational component especially when other people
who are involved include Patton Boggs and Sherry Ellebracht of Government
Relations. Invitations should be extended on a statewide basis. Sherry Ellebracht
indicated they had not sent out on a statewide basis but had sent to the state
legislators, city and county municipalities, CASTA distribution list and others. She
asked Director Tobiassen to provide contact information for the E-470 committee.
Director James suggested we could contact an organization like the Colorado
Municipal League (CML) who would have more of a cross-city contact list. Director
Folska indicated we should work closely with CRL for a list of all the state
representatives.
 Director Tobiassen asked about video recording of the event. Adrian responded we
will have video shots and they will do a recording of the event for archival
purposes. A copy of this should be available via appropriate channels.
3. Grand Opening Ribbon Cutting Ceremonies
General Manager Washington indicated that following the P3 discussions everyone
will gather at the Wewatta Plaza for the ribbon cutting ceremonies. There will be
food trucks, festivities, etc. There is a confirmed list of speakers for this event. A
few changes could be made if Secretary Foxx is in attendance. The House is in
session so it is possible a number of Colorado representatives will not be present.
Some of the speakers include DUSPA Chair Elbra Wedgeworth, Contractor Kiewit,
and Walt Isenberg to speak on the grand opening of the hotel. Chair Sisk will open.
They will use a professional M.C., Gloria MacNeal, from Channel 4. There will be
limited reserved seating for current RTD Board, DUSPA Chair, and CDOT.
Director Anderson inquired about seating for the elderly or disabled who may be
ambulatory but cannot stand for long periods of time. General Manager
Washington indicated provisions are being made for the ADA but he would need to
follow up on this question. Director Folska responded that having a separate area
is not the same as equal. More work needs to be done on this issue.
Director James inquired about when the bus facility will be open to the public.
Adrian responded Friday afternoon after the ribbon cutting. RTD will be opened for
business beginning the 2-6:00 a.m. shift Sunday night into Monday morning.
Chair Sisk emphasized it is important that we make provisions to accommodate all
the people during this event.
IV.

Use of Smart Phones and other Devices during Board Meetings
Committee Chair Sisk began the discussion by talking on the importance of collaboration
and working together. There are many tools available to us which allows the Board
members to perform their functions. We do not need rules; we are all adults and can

Packet Pg. 48

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 10, 2014 12:00 PM (Committee Reports)

6.G

6.G

He then opened up the discussion. Director Tobiassen indicated that he was the one who
had advocated for paperless packets. This has significantly reduced his paper load,
provided access to research and is an appropriate tool to use. He did note in the City of
Aurora they require that phones are silenced. Otherwise, he feels these technology tools
are helpful to the meeting and should be used. Other Directors shared their perspective.
Director James agreed with Director Tobiassen and stated we need to really focus on the
problem. It is not an issue of what device is used but rather we are giving the proper
attention and courtesy to the people who are attending the meeting. We really do not
need any specific set of rules but adopt “guidelines” that encourage attention to the
problem and topics at hand; Guidelines should be to treat everyone like adults.
Director Sisk stated his understanding of a general consensus that phones should be
silenced and no vibrations, no voice calls during the meeting and an overall guideline for
showing courtesy and respect but electronic devices will be allowed. Director Walker
offered up some suggestion based on whether there is a quasi-judicial type decision being
made or not and stated he is in favor of using electronic devices during the meetings. He
offered up that there is a difference between committee and Board meetings and perhaps
different guidelines should apply. Director Hoy provided the qualifier that this applies
whether it is a cell phone, IPAD, notebook, etc. and it should be electronic devices, not a
particular type.
Director Bagley made a statement about his concerns over the decorum and Board
behavior during meetings that was read into record.
Director Folska stated it is important that the Board remember we are elected to do the
work of the people. We are ”public servants.” We need to be open and transparent to
further the public trust.
Several questions were asked about the upcoming Board Effectiveness Workshop and if it
will cover some of these items? Will it be RTD specific? Paula responded it is intended to
look at best practices and how successful Boards run effective meetings. It will cover
some exercises around some of these issues and will also focus on the more common
parliamentarian procedures. It is not intended to replace common courtesy, respect and
overall meeting decorum that are incumbent on each Board member to show during a
meeting.
Director Sisk indicated he will work on a draft of guidelines (perhaps two paragraphs) from
the Executive Committee, starting with the lead-in from Director Tobiassen. He will invite
comments from the Executive Committee before publication and from the Board.

Packet Pg. 49

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 10, 2014 12:00 PM (Committee Reports)

agree to find a way to work together in a respectful manner to each other, the staff and
our constituency. He hopes we can come up with a clear path for moving forward.

Other Matters

Director Folska accepted the apology and also apologized for anything that she may have
done to create the situation. She was unaware of the other issues mentioned and also
expressed that she did not directly mention names or call anyone out when she simply
asked as Chair of the Committee for a point of order. She is looking forward to us moving
ahead and focusing on the agency’s business.
Director Walker shared his feelings that it is difficult as committee chair to catch all the
bouncing balls or know when scope creep has set in. He apologized for allowing his
finance meeting to wander and asked for tools from other Board members on how to
identify and keep topics on track during a meeting.
Director Anderson shared one of the tools used is with timing and setting time limits for
speaking which can tighten a meeting up. This is one of the reasons why she tried to
implement the “speak no more than 2 times on a topic.”

Director Anderson asked for a chance to speak during other matters. She had a prepared

Retiree Awards
Assistant General Manager Bruce Abel, Operations, recognized the retirees from operations
and asked Mike Ames to do the honor of introducing them.
Mike Ames introduced Reuben Martinez who retired as a street supervisor after 23 years
with RTD. Mike stated Reuben had spent 6 years in bus operations before moving to
street supervision. Reuben was an excellent employee and very dedicated. General
Manager Washington interjected that he had seen Reuben working on a fence at his house
in Aurora so he surmises Reuben will have a big “honey do” list for his retirement. Reuben
thanked RTD for the opportunity to be a part of the operations.
Mike Ames introduced Jimmy Outlaw, an employee with over 20 years experience at RTD.
Jimmy began also in bus operations and spent the last 16 years as a dispatcher. Jimmy
had cross- trained on a number of other positions including street supervision. This is
Jimmy’s second retirement-first with 20 years in the Air Force and now with 20 years at
RTD.
Jimmy stated he considered it a privilege to have four families: His first and second
personal families, his Air Force family and now his RTD family. It is an honor.
Assistant General Manager Austin Jenkins, Rail Operations, acknowledged the retirees
from rail operations and invited his managers to assist him with the presentation.
Terry Emmons, rail operations manager, introduced Greg Boysen, instruction supervisor for
Maintenance of Way, for his 34 years of service. Greg was unable to be present but Terry
reflected on his stellar career. He stated he had worked with Greg over many years and
Greg was a trained and skillful craftsman. Terry and Greg’s career expanded over 31

Phil Eberl, manager of LRV Maintenance introduced Cal Shankster who retired as
maintenance –of-way manager with over 30 years service at RTD. Cal of course needed
no introduction as he had served as the acting AGM of rail operations in the interim before
Austin Jenkins had been hired. Cal was skillful and knowledgeable about every phase of
LRT and did his work with precision and dedication. Cal had begun his career in bus
mechanics and moved over to LRT in 1993. Terry Emmons added he had worked for Cal
for a number of years. Cal was a person who worked around the clock and never slept.
He was a great mentor and will be missed.
Cal expressed his appreciation to all of RTD, the staff, and the current and former Boards.
He is grateful for the work he got to do at RTD and will be moving on to start his new
career with the Denver Transit Operations Division for Commuter Rail.
Chair Sisk thanked all of the retirees and stated they were the reason for RTD success.
They were unsung heroes who had done their work with pride and integrity. The Board is
extremely grateful for the time they devoted to RTD and wish them the best in their new
endeavors. Thanks for a job well done.

Parks Diversity Leadership Award. She will accept this award in Portland Oregon.
The North Metro Groundbreaking Ceremony was well attended and a real success.
Several RTD Board members attended: Anderson, Bagley, Daly, Deadwyler, Folska,
Hoy, Lasater, Rivera-Malpiede, Solano and Walker. A number of dignitaries spoke
around the collaborative effort and process. Directors Hoy and Solano spoke also
and did a wonderful job representing the Board.
Director James attended the ULI Shifting Suburbs Series on bus rapid
transformation.
Several Board members plan to attend the Road Ahead-Designing for Density:
Implementing Transportation Solution on March 27: Directors Bagley, James,
Rivera-Malpiede and Sisk.
On Saturday, March 29, the LCLAA Cesar Chavez Dinner Dance and Awards
Ceremony will be held. Director Solano purchased a table and will be representing
RTD along with Director Rivera-Malpiede.
The COMTO annual scholarship banquet will be held on April 11. Several Board
members plan to attend which includes Director Deadwyler, Folska, RiveraMalpiede, Tobiassen, Solano and Chair Sisk. This should be a wonderful event to
support youth in transportation. General Manager Washington and a couple of
other RTD members were the founding members for this Chapter.
Board members and senior leadership have received the meeting summary notes
and results from the survey of the Joint Strategic Planning Advance which was
held in March. Gary Suiter did a wonderful job of facilitating this retreat.

General Manager's Report
General Manager Washington provided these comments:
 On March 27, RTD will host a visit from the Regional Transportation Commission of
Southern Nevada. RTD will provide an overview of their DBE program, WIN, Eagle
project and take them on a tour of DUS. Director Rivera-Malpiede as the Chair of
the Civil Rights Committee will represent the Board.
 RTD has been a participant in the Clinton Global Initiative for the past couple of
years. This year the event will be in Denver and RTD will be participating. This will
be a good chance to share with national and international key decision makers.
 RTD is continuing to plan for a couple of visits which will occur in the next couple
of months:
1. House Transportation & Infrastructure Committee P3 Panel—When he
testified before the Panel a couple of weeks ago, he had invited them to
come see what Denver is doing. They will be here April 22-24. He is not
sure of format as they are coordinating their own schedule. RTD will be
talking about DUS and the Eagle project. They will also visit with the US 36

Coalition and DIA. This is a great opportunity for the City of Denver. He
has heard back from the Subcommittee Panel where he testified and they
have provided him with about 15 follow-up questions. This is normal
procedure and he will share with the Board when complete.
2. DUS Grand Opening—Planning is underway for the P3 Roundtable on May 9
which is hosted by Patton-Boggs. There are three aspects to this
roundtable: Public sector panel which will include RTD, CDOT and perhaps
member of FTA; Private sector which will have an international flavor and a
Dialog with the Transportation Secretary Foxx and WIN participants.
The Free Metro Ride vehicle was available today for the Board members to review.
We are on target to have all of the Free Metro Ride vehicles ready before the DUS
opening. We are making progress on the bus bowls at 18 & 19 street. At the
opening, we will have peak hours service only to Civic Center.
RTD continues to rack up awards for our West Corridor. We have received awards
from WTS and the APWA for our work on the West Corridor. This attests to the
collaboration and interoperability of a great team working together on this project.

Budget Transfer for West Rail Line Track Paving

It is Recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager and/or his designee to transfer $650,000 of the remaining
funds from the Wadsworth parking structure project to install track paving at three RTD
West Line Light Rail Stations.

Director Folska asked a process question about unanimous consent. She stated she
could understand when we pass things all at once that are similar but suggested
we might separate them when the items are not similar. Chair Sisk acknowledged
her comment.
Director Lasater shared that how the process normally occurs is if there is an item
to be discussed on the unanimous consent, this item is pulled from the unanimous
consent for further discussion. Items appear on the unanimous consent agenda
when they have passed committee unanimously and do not really have anything to
do with whether they are like or unlike. This is the process they followed in Parker
and this is the protocol for most unanimous consent agendas.

Subject:

Approval of Funding for Light Rail Storage
Tracks

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors approve funding
for the construction of light rail storage tracks as part of the I-225 Rail Line project. The storage tracks
are estimated to cost $12 million which will be funded by the overall FasTracks program. The storage
tracks are needed to add reliability to the entire light rail system.
BACKGROUND
The District’s original plans for FasTracks expansion included the addition of a new light rail vehicle
(LRV) maintenance and storage facility. As the scope of the FasTracks Plan was refined, the decision
was made to expand the existing Elati LRV maintenance facility instead of adding a new facility to save
costs. All LRV maintenance and mid-day and overnight storage is currently performed at the Elati and
Mariposa maintenance facilities. This setup was able to successfully support the opening of the West
Rail Line without negatively impacting the operations of the current system. However, the planning for
and opening of the West Rail Line made it evident that this system is not expected to be able to support
the I-225 Rail Line without impacts to the reliability of current light rail operations.
The I-225 Rail Line is located much farther from the existing maintenance facilities so it is difficult to
support mid-day and overnight storage of the entire I-225 LRV fleet without causing disruptions to the
existing service. The light rail system will not be able to support all pull-outs from Elati and Mariposa
with the addition of the I-225 trains. This would require the signal system to constantly operate over
capacity (yellow signals) which reduces system reliability. In addition, the overnight maintenance
window would be severely impacted making it nearly impossible to do maintenance work on the line
during that period.
DISCUSSION
Rail Operations has identified additional train storage capacity as a critical element in being able to
maintain reliable service on the existing system and future corridors. Rail Operations, Planning and
Capital Programs staff worked together to develop a solution that would solve the operations needs
without major budget or schedule implications to the I-225 project and entire FasTracks program.
This solution is to add the following infrastructure to the I-225 Rail Line: 1. Additional storage tracks at
the Peoria Station with capacity to store 18 LRVs on the tail tracks and 2. One layover track adjacent to
the 13th Avenue Station that will allow for emergency storage of LRVs. The infrastructure improvements
at the Peoria Station will also include a small building to be used for train operator reporting and storage
of equipment used for interior LRV cleaning.
The Peoria tail track storage coupled with the small building will allow for up to 18 LRVs for the I-225
Rail Line to start and end their day on the corridor and relieve the stress that would have been put on
the existing system by requiring all trains to pull in and out of Elati and Mariposa every day. No major
maintenance or exterior cleaning will be performed at Peoria as this can all be handled at Elati. Train

Packet Pg. 61

12.A

schedules will need to be written so that the LRVs stored at Peoria constantly rotate so all LRVs can be
serviced at Elati on a regular basis.
This is a necessary project to support light rail asset management and state of good repair. Without
these storage tracks, RTD will incur significant operations costs. The signal system would likely require
upgrades to support the number of trains that would need to deadhead from Elati to the Southeast and I225 corridors. In addition, there would be ongoing costs associated with increased mileage on the LRVs
and overhead contact system (OCS). Special accommodations would also be necessary for overnight
maintenance along the line which would require the added cost of providing service with bus bridges due
to the limited maintenance windows.
It is important that this item be funded now as performing this work while the I-225 Rail Line is still
under construction will be significantly less expensive and less disruptive to ongoing service than waiting
until the line is complete. In addition, many of the components of this work such as special track work
(switches and crossovers), signal equipment and power facilities are long lead items that require early
action in order to complete this work by opening day of the I-225 Rail Line.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The $12 million capital cost to construct the light rail storage tracks will be funded from the overall
FasTracks program because these improvements are necessary to support the entire light rail system. It
is anticipated that the payback period for the $12 million capital expenditure will be 7-10 years through
potential reductions in ongoing operating and maintenance costs.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the Board of Directors approve funding for the construction of light rail storage tracks as part of the
I-225 Rail Line project. The storage tracks are estimated to cost $12 million which will be funded by
the overall FasTracks program. The storage tracks are needed to add reliability to the entire light rail
system.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not approve the action to approve funding for the
construction of light rail storage tracks as part of the I-225 Rail Line project. This will have negative
implications for light rail system reliability and increased operating costs. This is not recommended.

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: April 2, 2014

Board Meeting Date: April 15, 2014

Subject:

Adoption of 2015 Performance Measures

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
adopts the attached 2015 Performance Measures for Goals 1-7. There are 23 performance measures
in total.
POLICY REFERENCE
Fiscal Policy Statements – Budget Policy 10
BACKGROUND
Each year the RTD Board of Directors adopts a vision and mission statement, goals, objectives, and
specific performance measures. These measures provide a framework in which RTD can determine
how well it provides service to its passengers and the citizens of the District. A report detailing yearto-date performance on each of these measures is presented to the Board of Directors following the
end of each quarter.
DISCUSSION
Recommended changes in the adopted goals from 2014 to 2015 are listed below:


Goal 2.1 Prompt response to facility complaints
o The goal for Average Facilities Maintenance Complaints per Month is increased to <
20.0 from < 14.0 per month to reflect more accurate reporting on these measures and
system growth in facilities that is challenging our resources.



Goal 3.1 Maintain system-wide on time performance
o The goal for system-wide on time performance for bus service will be determined by the
Board of Directors later in fiscal year 2014 with adoption of the 2015 Budget.



Goal 4.1 Reduce average customer response time
o Average TIC Call Wait Time is revised to “Average TIC Speed of Answer”. The new
manager in TIC determined that the TIC call wait time was not being measured
accurately, and it is proposed that speed of answer is a more relevant and measurable
goal. Speed of answer measures the time from ring to answer and includes hold time.
The goal is reduced to < 65.0 seconds from < 75.0 seconds.
o Response Time on TIC Customer Inquiries was established at < 1.0 day and is found to
be no longer relevant. Response time on TIC customer inquiries is actually immediate in
that all TIC calls are answered as received. The measure is removed.



Goal 4.2 Improve level of customer complaints
o Regarding Average Response Time to Customer Complaints, it is proposed that Initial
Response and Final Resolution be consolidated into one measure entitled “Average
Cycle Time”. This is the average number of days between when a customer contact is

Packet Pg. 71

12.B

entered for action and when the action is completed (closed). It is a measure of the
number of days required for RTD departments to research and resolve issues reported to
RTD by customers. The goal will remain at < 10 days and it is proposed that the
measure be reported by category as follows:
 RTD Transportation (Bus and Rail)
 RTD All Other Departments
 First Transit – Commerce City
 First Transit – Denver
 First Transit – Longmont
 Veolia


Goal 6.2 Increase ridership
o Overall Ridership Increase will be established by the financial plans inherent in the
adoption of the 2015 Annual Budget in November 2014 and in the Board-approved
Ridership Goal model and it is noted as a placeholder at this time. It is a forecast.



Goal 6.3 Increase in fare revenue and total operating revenue
o These measures will be established by the financial plans inherent in the adoption of the
2015 Annual Budget in November 2014 and are noted as placeholders until that point.
These are forecasts.
o EcoPass Revenue is eliminated from this measurement because it is considered no
longer relevant and the category has had zero to negative growth as large contract
users have been converting to other fare media such as FlexPass.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The 2015 Performance Measures will be utilized in the development of the final 2015 Adopted
Budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Adopt the 2015 Goals and Objectives and the accompanying performance measures included
in the 2015 Performance Report.
2. Modify the recommended 2015 Goals and Objectives and the accompanying performance
measures to be included in the 2015 Performance Report and make required adjustments, if
necessary, to the 2015 Requested Budget.
3. Do not adopt the 2015 Goals and Objectives and the accompanying performance measures
included in the 2015 Performance Report.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington

Date: April 3, 2014

From:

Austin Jenkins, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

April 3, 2014

Board Meeting Date: April 15, 2014

Subject:

Approval of contract award for Light Rail
Training Simulator

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to approve a contract with OKTAL in an amount not to
exceed $1,543,000 to procure and install a Light Rail training simulator at the Elati Light Rail Facility.
BACKGROUND
Rail Operations identified the need for a simulator in 2010 but funding was not available but funding
became available in 2013 via the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) process.
The complexity of our system, the number of trains we run, and the difficulty that our trainers have in
getting time on the mainline to train new operators without interfering with regular service makes this
tool extremely important. It allows new operators to become familiar with the vehicle and the operating
environment without risk to people or property. It also allows instructors to observe and correct operator
behavior and techniques in a controlled environment. The tool is flexible enough to expand as the system
expands and will pay dividends for years to come.
The procurement process began in December 2013. This process resulted in the receipt of six (6)
proposals. Several proposers set up demonstrations of their products at the Elati facility to aid in the
evaluation process.
DISCUSSION
The Request for Proposals (RFP) was advertised and made available to prospective proposers December
17, 2013. In January of 2014 a briefing for interested proposers was held and written questions from
prospective proposers were received. In February 2014 responses to written questions were sent to
prospective proposers. Proposals were due on February 19, 2014 2:00 p.m. to Contracts and
Procurement, RTD, 1600 Blake Street, Denver, Colorado.
Proposals were received from six (6) potential suppliers with oral presentations, if necessary, by selected
finalists the week of March 3, 2014. Final selection to be made no later than April 15, 2014.
As a result of this process we recommend that the RTD Board of Directors authorize General Manager,
or his designee, to accept the proposal from OKTAL, one of the world leaders in this technology.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for this project was included in the 2013 capital budget for Rail Operations. The price proposed
by OKTAL does not exceed the budgeted funds of $1,543,500 for this project.
ALTERNATIVES
1) Award the contract to OKTAL as recommended

Packet Pg. 84

12.C

2) Cancel the procurement and resolicit. This not recommended since this will cause additional
delays in the acquisition and installation of this vital tool.
