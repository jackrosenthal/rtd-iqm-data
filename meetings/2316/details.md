### A. Proclamation for Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA 25th Anniversary)

Chair Sisk noted that the 25th Anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act was celebrated over the weekend.  He recognized Director Folska as a featured speaker at the event.  He read a proclamation recognizing the Board’s support of the Americans with Disabilities Act.  He asked the Board for their affirmation in support of the proclamation which was given unanimously via voice vote.

Director Folska thanked the Board and the community for embracing people with disabilities and encouraging them to live their full potential.  She thinks the ADA really signifies that when you imagine the impossible possible, you can do so many things.  Director Folska noted that there were many municipal leaders in the audience.  She shared with them a recent discussion about the need for sidewalks so people with disabilities can access public transportation.

## V. Public Participation

Chair Sisk indicated that if someone had not signed up but decided to speak he would give them an opportunity after calling on those who signed up.  He asked speakers to limit their remarks to three minutes.

- Honorable Mayor Folsom, Town of Superior and US 36 Mayors and Commissioners Coalition (MCC) representative, said that MCC appreciates the entire dialog that has gone into the US 36 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Service Plan up to this point.  Some specifics that MCC specifically want to recognize are the addition of most of the Route S trips back into the opening day plan, adding the Flatiron Station as a stop for the BJCC Route as well as Church Ranch Station as a stop for the DWB Service.  MCC is eager to continue working with RTD staff to determine a path forward so everyone can state that the Service Plan is a net-new service for the US 36 Corridor.  To achieve this the MCC has three top priorities they would like addressed: (1) restoration of the remaining Route S trips, (2) restore mid-day service along Broadway in Boulder to maximize capital investment of the US 36 express lanes and (3) see additional service to connect Boulder Junction at Depot Square with the region, including additional service to Union Station.  He reminded the Board that Boulder County and the corridor communities contribute over $20 million per year to RTD while the proposed service level represents approximately a 5% annual return on that investment.  MCC requests that this be increased to 15% of their annual contribution and that the additional funding be used to restore existing service and create new service along the US 36 Corridor.  He stated that the MCC is eager to work cooperatively with the RTD staff to pilot new partnership opportunities to build new transit markets.

- Honorable Mayor Appelbaum, Mayor of Boulder and MCC member, reiterated his thanks to the Board and staff for their work to update the fares as well as the work done thus far on the US 36 BRT Service Plan.  He said that he wanted to focus on some items that the Board may not be aware of that really jump out at the US 36 Metro Mayors and Commissioners Coalition (MCC).  The FasTracks expenses projected for 2019 for the open corridors are as follows: West Corridor - $16 million, I-225 Corridor - $16 million, North Corridor - $12 million, BRT - $1.2 million.  He reminded everyone that the US 36 BRT Corridor is a FasTracks Corridor.  He stated that his area would take a $16 million budget in a heartbeat.  The subsidy per boarding for light rail is $6.20 while the B/BV Route is $2.30.  He stated that is quite a difference but that corridor cannot seem to get significant net-new service.  Mayor Appelbaum pointed out that the subsidy for SkyRide service to Boulder is less than most other SkyRide routes but the corridor cannot seem to get half-hour service.  He stated that the figures for the US 36 Corridor’s contributions are actually understated because EcoPass dollars are allocated across the entire system, not just along the routes that EcoPass holders use.

Mayor Appelbaum acknowledged that schedules can change and that the Service Plan before the Board this evening is just a first pass but he is concerned that service demand cannot be established for services that are not offered.  He asked how RTD can tell what the ridership would be on mid-day express service if that service is not offered.  He wonders how RTD can determine if half-hour SkyRide service is warranted, especially from Boulder Junction at Depot Square, if it is not offered.  He stated that the MCC is absolutely RTD’s partners.  They want to make this work so that US 36 BRT can be recognized as the best BRT in the Country; however, they hope that RTD will look at some of their concerns raised so that they can be addressed in partnership between the corridor communities and RTD.

- Commissioner Jones, Boulder County, appreciates the opportunity to provide comments on the proposed US 36 BRT Service Plan on behalf of Boulder County.  Boulder County supports adoption of the Plan and appreciates RTD’s efforts to collaborate with them on it.  US 36 BRT is critical to the community and represents the areas primary return-on-investment that the residents will receive through the FasTracks plan until the completion of the entire Northwest Rail Corridor.  She stated it is therefore critical for the rollout of US 36 BRT to be an overwhelming success, not just for the Boulder County voters but also as RTD’s first BRT.

Boulder County is supportive of many elements of the Service Plan; however, there are outstanding issues that need to be addressed in the near future. First, the plan does not provide any significant net-new investment in improved service comparable to that provided to other FasTracks corridors.  Rather it largely reallocates the funding already provided to the US 36 Corridor.  Second, no one should experience worse service or be required to pay more for comparable service than they do today.  The latest Service Plan still has several areas of reduced service, most notably the elimination of mid-day express service between Denver and Boulder.  Finally, the Service Plan does not adequately account for areas experiencing significant growth like the Boulder Junction at Depot Square area.  US 36 Communities contribute well over $25 million in revenues through the 0.4% FasTracks Sales Tax each year; however, they are only receiving $900K in new transit service over what they receive today.  That is less than 5% of what the corridor contributes to FasTracks.

Commissioner Jones stated that the Northwest Corridor is a team player.  They have supported the buildout of the entire FasTracks system but they need the team to reciprocate and support an equitable return-on-investment.  Boulder County believes RTD needs to continue to work with the Corridor to continue to enhance service as outlined by Mayor Folsom; however, they are confident that together it is possible to build out the BRT network that the Corridor needs and deserves.   She looks forward to continued cooperation with RTD.

- Honorable Mayor Gunning, City of Lone Tree, stated that he was here this evening to speak in favor of the Southeast Rail Extension.  He thanked the Board, RTD staff and all the other partners for helping this project get to the next step.  He said that in the spirit of the moto “build as much as we can as fast as we can”, he wants to talk about the impact of transit on his community’s daily lives.  It allows the employees in the workforce get to jobs they might not have access to otherwise as well as for employers to expand their hiring base.  He noted that Douglas County has a concentration of our older population so access to transportation will be a need going forward.  He stated that it is clear that RTD rail stations have become a driver for development so it is really a competitive issue for his region.  Therefore, Lone Tree became the core of a regional partnership to finish the Southeast Rail Extension.

Mayor Gunning reiterated that this is a regional piece of infrastructure, not just for Lone Tree.  He said that he is proud to stand before the Board as they make their decision this evening knowing that his area followed through on every item they promised: $25 million in regional cash contributions, all right-of-way has been donated and all fees and charges for municipal services have been waived.  He acknowledged that like every piece of major infrastructure there has been some controversy.  He noted that there is a dissenting opinion in Lone Tree’s City Council concerning the use of Federal funding as well as questions about the percent of match; however, the package that the community put on the table from day one remains the same package today even though the projected cost has changed.  He believes they are leading the way in the Metro area with over a 12% match.  He hopes that given the funding issues across the Metro area that this model can find some use going forward.  Mayor Gunning stated that finishing FasTracks remains his goal.  RTD and the community need to find a way to fund the services that people are demanding.

- Honorable Mayor Waid, Town of Parker, thanked the Board for their time and devotion to the citizens.  He remembered standing before the Board about one year ago.  He drove to that meeting and by the time he arrived he was aggravated and frustrated.  He stated that today he followed the path the Southeast Rail Extension would take and then took the train.  He said that his experience today was one that he can only describe with one word: enjoyable.  He arrived in a good state of mind and was excited to be here.  Mayor Waid stated that he was here to extend his vigorous support for the Southeast Rail Extension on behalf of the unanimous support from the Town Council.  This Extension gives accessibility to more people in his Town.  He noted that he could talk about the regional benefits, of which there are many, or the time opportunities, of which there are many as well; however, most importantly, having access to the metro area through light rail is a benefit to his citizens.  He implored the Board to vote yes.

- Honorable Mayor Murphy, City of Lakewood, noted that this year the Lakewood City Council allocated an additional $2 million for sidewalks when they normally budget $300-500K.  He thanked Director Folska for advocating for that.  He shared that about a dozen years ago the Metro Mayors Caucus joined forces with RTD to support FasTracks.  He pointed out that many of those Mayors were Mayors that knew they would never get a FasTracks line but they understood the regionalism of FasTracks.  The great recession hit about five years later.  He stated that those were tough times but the Metro Mayors Caucus banded together again and formed the FasTracks Task Force.  He felt it was his duty as one of the towns that would get the first line to Chair the Task Force.  He is here tonight to support his friends in the Southeast and along US 36.  He stated that it is well known that the Southeast has contributed an unprecedented local match.  The dream of attracting employers is coming true.  He asked the Board to support that dream by voting yes.

- Honorable Mayor Rakowsky, City of Greenwood Village, said that most of his adult life has been in government service.  He noted that the Board, District and community had been blessed by the service of someone that needs recognition, Rick Clarke.  He stated that there would be no discussion of the Southeast Rail Extension this evening without him.  Mayor Rakowsky echoed the comment of other elected officials.  He noted that infrastructure drives the economy.  He recognized that one of the duties of a Board is to have a vision, and the vision of the RTD Board is called FasTracks.  He stated that the vision only works if there is leadership that executes that vision.  He acknowledged that FasTracks has come a long way but there is still a long way to go.  He urged the Board not to think of the present but future generations that will recognize the laudable things they have done.

- Keith Simon was here representing Coventry Development.  They are the developers of the Ridgegate Master Plan and have been working collaboratively with RTD since 1999.  He stated the Board’s actions would move the Southeast Rail Extension forward to the final step of securing a New Starts Grant.  He urged the Board to vote yes.  The project has the opportunity to become a national model for Public Private Partnerships and will stimulate three great Transit Oriented Developments.  It will also provide connections to the North as well as creation of a great End of Line station.  He stated that Coventry Development supports the build out of all FasTracks lines.  He hopes that the Directors will capitalize on the past 16 years of hard work to lay the groundwork for this extension with a yes vote.

- Mike Fitzgerald, Denver South Economic Development Partnership (DSEDP), thanked the Board for the opportunity to speak and for their past hard work in building FasTracks.  Denver South Economic Development Partnership helps all businesses in the area of Lincoln to Belleview and Santa Fe to Parker Road.  He stated that nothing is more important to DSEDP’s past successes than the transit system.  There is not a week that goes by that there are not recruiters offering lush incentives for businesses to leave Colorado.  As job creation gets more difficult, the incentives will continue to increase.  He stated that Colorado is doing better at attracting employers than most other states and the transit system is a key piece of that.  If the entire FasTracks system is not finished the Metro area will not have the kind of success, prosperity and economic diversity that there is now.  He noted that DSEDP was one of the first organizations to support the 0.4% FasTracks tax.  He appealed to the Directors to vote to finish the Southeast Rail Extension and he pledged to continue to fight for completion of the entire system.

- Steve Klausing, Denver South Transportation Management Association and DSEDP, recognized that his Association has had many partnerships with RTD.  Today he was reminded of the first project he worked on with Interim General Manager Genova on the light rail platforms.  In the next 24 months his area will be investing $3 million for sidewalks, all of which will be last mile connections.  He asked the Board to remember 6 years ago when everyone was wondering not how fast light rail lines would be opening but if it would even be possible to finish one in the next 10 years; however, in 2016 RTD will now be opening 5 lines.  He stated that FasTracks is the biggest public work transit project in the United States and the Board had the opportunity to take one more step toward completing the entire system.  His organization was one of the first that supported FasTracks and they are as committed as ever to building out the entire system.   His organization is happy to be contributing money to the extension.  He acknowledged that the Southeast Rail Extension has some of the broadest based support that an RTD project has had.  There are many people supporting the Extension that do not have financial gain but see it as one more step in finishing the system.  He encouraged the Directors to vote yes.

- Gina McAfee, US 36 Commuting Solutions, stated that they were very appreciative of the work done by RTD staff to develop the US 36 Bus Rapid Transit Service Plan.  They appreciate how the plan has been modified to respond to a number of concerns; however, US 36 Commuting Solutions remains concerned about removing mid-day express service, converting all BX routes to all stop service, and the lack of mid-day and airport service to Boulder Junction.  She stated that the service plan does not take into account the residential and commercial development near the Boulder Junction station.  She urged the Directors and staff to continue to monitor the US 36 BRT and adjust as necessary.

- Amber Decker, Denver, shared that she commutes to the SkyRidge Medical Center every day on the light rail and SkyRidge shuttle.  She stated that if there was a stop closer to SkyRidge she would not have to take the shuttle.  Taking RTD makes for a no stress commute.  She is the first point of contact for SkyRidge patients.  If she has a stress free commuter, she is in a better frame of mind which leads to a better experience for her patients.  She said that many times when she gets off the train there are patients there that do not know how to get to the hospital.  She encouraged the Directors to vote yes on the Southeast Rail Extension.

- Adam Steffl, Lone Tree, said that he was here not only to offer his support but also that of Ridgegate West Village Association Board of Directors for the Southeast Rail Extension.  He stated that everyone he has spoken to is very supportive of the Extension.  It is a great opportunity to integrate transit with development in the neighborhood.  He is glad to see RTD so close to taking the next step to begin this project.

- Kim Monson, Lone Tree City Council, thanked the Board for their time and dedication.  She also thanked her colleagues that spoke this evening.  She said they are good people and have great intentions.  She expressed her concern of the $92 million in Federal funds that will be used on the Southeast Rail Extension if RTD is awarded a New Starts Grant.  She stated that the Federal Government is supposed to pay for projects that benefit everyone, not just one community.  She believes these kind of projects should be funded regionally instead of federally.  She does not believe it is fair to ask our neighbors to pay for things that will never benefit them.  She noted that the Federal Government has been running a deficit year over year and we are passing that debt on to our children.  She challenged the Board to figure out a way to do this project regionally rather than asking the Federal Government to do it.  She stated that great people in great societies pass on something better to the next generation.

- Tom Clarke, Metro Denver Economic Development Corporation CEO and Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce Executive Director, reminded everyone that his organization was the single largest investor in the FasTracks tax election in 2004.  He stated that they are not only a stakeholder but RTD’s partner.  His organization is one of the most avid supporters of RTD.  FasTracks has become the embodiment of the regional culture and economic success that it created.  He stated that every day he gets to see the magnetic pull of FasTracks that brings new opportunity to this region.  He is here this evening to speak on behalf of both organizations he represents in favor of the Southeast Rail Extension.  He recognized that they agreed with the RTD Board several years ago that this Extension should be delayed until much of the system had a degree of certainty that it would be built; however, RTD has made great progress since then.  This Extension is a unique opportunity for RTD to demonstrate the power of transit and the willingness of other investors to provide significant additional funding.  He asked the Board to vote affirmatively on the Extension this evening.

- Chris Waggett commented that many of the Board know him as the CEO of D4 Urban and their work at Alameda Station.  He stated that is vivid proof of a public-private development partnership.  He said that he was here this evening though as the Chairman of Transit Alliance.  Transit Alliance was one of the prime movers behind the regional support of the FasTracks buildout.  He stated that he personally knows the power of a public-private partnership, of which this is a benchmark example.  The Southeast Rail Extension will give access to jobs and housing, both north and south.  This Extension will be a regional catalyst for economic growth.  He noted that this action is an example of how RTD can do as much as we can as effectively as we can and encouraged the Board to vote yes.

- Dennis Houston, Parker Chamber of Commerce, stated that on behalf of the Parker area’s Chamber of Commerce, 650 businesses and 10K+ employees he wants to express their full support of the Southeast Rail Extension.  He asked each Board member to provide their full support with a yes vote.  He said that today the Board gets the opportunity to be super heroes to the people of Douglas County.  In 1982 Parker only had a few hundred residents, in 2000 they had 25K residents, and today they are approaching 50K.  As the South metro area is looking forward to tremendous growth they are also looking forward to extreme congestion.  He recognized that CDOT does not have the funding necessary to build the needed roads in the area.  That is where the Board’s role as RTD super heroes comes into play.  He believes this is a once in a lifetime opportunity with an amazing partnership between the Federal Government, Public Sector as well as private investors to bring a credible solution to the table that will have a positive impact on millions of people for years to come.

Dennis Houston asked the Board to give this opportunity their most serious consideration.  He noted that many of the Parker residents work in other areas of the region and would welcome having a green, cost effective method of commuting daily.   They believe that the Southeast Rail Extension is not just about Parker and Lone Tree but about the region.  Tonight they ask the Board to vote yes for thousands of new jobs, thousands of new homes, for millions of square feet of commercial development, and the hundreds of million dollars in increase property value.  He encouraged the Directors to put on their RTD super hero uniform and vote to impact lives, transform a region and build a better Colorado for generations to come.

- Brian McDonald, Charles Schwab, is here tonight on behalf of the Charles Schwab employees who live all over the city.  He urged the Board to vote yes on the Extension.  Currently Charles Schwab has 2,300 employees with the capacity for 4,500 when their third facility is done.  He said that this indicates that access to public transportation will be important to reduce congestion in the area.  He stated that Charles Schwab supports completion of the entire FasTracks project.  He shared there was a recent Wall Street Journal article discussing the influx of millennials coming to Denver.  Programs like FasTracks are what will help create a viable community for employers and employees.

- Linda Watson, SkyRidge Director of Public Affairs, shared that she had hoped to introduce her employee but the employee took the light rail while Linda Watson drove.  She recognized that while the employee was out of context she thought it was a very telling story.  She said on behalf of the SkyRidge employees she was here this evening to ask for the Board’s support.  She recognized that SkyRidge employs a variety of workers at varied pay scales, but overall hospitals are stable employers that are often in the community for decades.   She shared that SkyRidge purchased an EcoPass for every employee and many of them depend on it to get to work each day.  She asked for the Board’s support of the Southeast Rail Extension.

- Roger Partridge, Douglas County Commissions, stated that he was here in support of the Southeast Rail Extension.  He commended RTD staff and Mayor Gunning for their work on this project.  He shared that there are three Higher Education campuses that recently relocated to the area.  He was able to speak to two and they are very supportive of the Extension.  He said that he has also heard support for the other municipalities in the community as well as his fellow commissioners.  He stated that Douglas County is prepared to make this a ridership project.  He commended and thanked RTD.  He acknowledged that last year they had two Call-n-Rides that were being considered for cancellation.  He said because of the partnership between Douglas County and RTD we were able to work together collaboratively to maintain the service.

- Mitchell Wilson, Denver, shared that he has Cerebral Palsy and Epilepsy.  RTD is his sole mode of transportation.  He has been homeless for around 10 years and has four daughters.  He recognized the great employees at RTD but said he also calls the Telephone Information Center almost daily with complaints.  He wants RTD to be a better company.  He stated that he had a petition to give to the Board that was started to get equal rights for parents with strollers.  He also expressed frustration that the times posted are wrong, drivers do not wait for passengers and there are no bathrooms at our bus stops.

- Mark Witkiewicz, Corporex-Hampden Inn, expressed his support for the efforts of the Cities, elected officials, private sector, etc. for their efforts on the Southeast Rail Extension.  This is an economic engine that should not be turned down.  He thinks this is an opportunity to create jobs.  He stated that all his neighbors are in support of the Extension as well.

Chair Sisk thanked everyone for their comments.

Director Menten asked when the Board could expect an update on the progress of the Low Income Task Force and discussions on an income based pass.  Interim General Manager Genova said that he did not know when that topic would be discussed specifically but there are regular Fare Task Force updates provided through the Operations and Customer Service Committee.

Director Menten noted that staff had a meeting with Citizens for Finishing FasTracks.  She asked if there was any new information provided to them that has changed the direction the group plans to take.  Interim General Manager Genova does not think so.  He said it was more minor clarifications on things like budget numbers.

### A. Contract Amendment; 2nd Optional Year of 
2013-2015 Street Improvements & Shelter Installations Contract; # 33DM005

It is recommended by the Planning & Development Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to award a contract amendment to initiate the second optional year of a three-year contract for the annual Street Improvements & Shelter Installation contract with Manion Construction, Inc. for $390,318.35.  Funding for this contract amendment is provided by the annual 2015 – 2016 Engineering Expense Budgets.

### B. Recommendation for Passage of Resolution Authorizing the General Manager to Execute a Design Build Contract and other Agreements for the Southeast Rail Extension

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors pass the attached resolution authorizing the Chair of the RTD Board of Directors and the General Manager, whether interim or permanent, or their officers or delegates to execute grant agreements, a two phase design-build contract, intergovernmental agreements (IGAs), purchase and sale contracts, documents evidencing property interests, and such other agreements as are necessary or appropriate for the construction of the Southeast Rail Extension (SERE) and to accept third party contributions and increase the project budget by such third party contribution amounts to implement third party requested betterments, all according to the terms set forth in the Resolution.

Chair Sisk requested that Item F, Recommendation for Passage of Resolution Authorizing the General Manager to Execute a Design Build Contract and other Agreements for the Southeast Rail Extension, be moved to Item B.

Motion:              Director Bagley made the motion to approve the Southeast Rail Extension.

Director Anderson seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Director Lasater stated that no matter how thick the bread is you still have two sides to a slice.  He believes he has a unique perspective as he is the only Board member that was also part of the Metro Mayors Caucus that supported FasTracks in 2004.  He stated that the economic benefit of the Southeast Rail Extension is huge.  That was indicated by the number of people that spoke in support of the Extension this evening.  However, he thinks that on the economic development side they have not only had their side of the bread buttered but have all the jams, jellies, marmalade etc.   On the flip side the Board has to wrestle with the financial implications of approving this extension.

Director Lasater thinks it is respectable that staff was able to work with the community to get a 12% match as opposed to the 2.5% required through FasTracks.  He thinks it is respectable but not admirable because he wholeheartedly believes RTD is leaving millions on the table.  He noted that Dennis Houston from the Parker Chamber of Commerce asked the Directors to put on their super hero costumes but he thinks he left his at the cleaners.  Director Lasater stated that even though this is in his District and makes sense economically, there are still aspects he does not feel comfortable with so he will not be supporting it.

Director Lubow stated that she would be voting in favor of the Extension as financially it is a good deal, and she does not think RTD can turn up our noses at a Full Funding Grant Agreement.  That being said, she does have several concerns that she wants on record.  She is from the Northwest and they still do not have their rail.  She said the discussion about US 36 was very interesting and she agrees getting the Bus Rapid Transit running is important; however, she feels people have forgotten about the Northwest Rail.  She thinks RTD has a moral and legal obligation to finish the Northwest Rail.  Director Lubow also expressed concern over the local match changing from $40 million.  She was disappointed that this figure was reduced without a real discussion about why until some of the Directors began to question it.  She stated that despite those concerns she would vote yes.

Director Folska shared that one of the reasons she was elected was because she was committed to finishing FasTracks by the year 2020.  She still believes that is possible.  She stated that the voters voted for FasTracks so to her this discussion is kind of moot.  It is the Board’s job to now implement what the voters approved.  She expressed her appreciation at the outpouring of support for regionalism; however, it concerns her deeply when people say that RTD does not need to take federal money for our local activities.  She reminded everyone that last year tourism brought in over $12 billion to the Colorado Economy.  That is from people traveling that come to our airport, riding our public transit and renting cars to drive on our roads.  Director Folska said that as far as the local match changing, she must first recognize that the amount is still far above the 2.5% most municipalities bring forward in things like right-of-way.  She stated there is very little cash that actually gets brought to the table.  She does not feel we are leaving money on the table but finding it.  Director Folska said for these reasons she will vote yes.

Director Francone noted that in the Board Report there is an authorization to allow for expenditures up to $24.4 million for design, related staff costs and some land acquisition but then requests a budget transfer of only about $15.2 million form the FasTracks Management Reserve.  She wondered if there was a reason for the difference.  Rick Clarke, Assistant General Manager of Capital Programs, explained that it was really a timing issue.  The funds were not in the 2015 Adopted Budget so staff is transferring money from the contingency to do the work this year.  Next year when the money was programmed in the 2016 Budget the funds will be replaced.

Director Francone stated that she will vote yes but it was a very difficult decision for her.  As a new Board member she has spent countless hours trying to figure out how this was negotiated.  She recognized that originally there was $40 million on the table that suddenly turned into $28 million.  She said that staff, the City of Lone Tree, and other Board members have assured her that it really does not matter since RTD is getting the land we need without having to pay for it; however, it seems very disingenuous to her.  She stated that the best case scenario is that it is very sloppy estimation and she does not even want to consider the worst.  Director Francone also expressed concern that RTD will not receive $92 million for a Full Funding Grant Agreement.  She stated that she will vote yes but cautioned staff to stay within budget.  She appreciates the work staff has done and the contribution above and beyond the required local match by our partners.

## XIV. Executive Session

There was no Executive Session.

## XV. Old Business

Director Bagley stated that he cannot express how proud he is of the work of the Board staff and that of the Marketing Department for the APTA Transit Board Member (TBM) and Board Support Seminar.  He said that he has never seen the kind of materials that were handed out at this conference for the tours.  He believes it is just outstanding material.  He hopes that staff will submit these tour booklets for an APTA Award.

Director Bagley shared that he attended the Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility (CRMF) Open House.  He thought it was an outstanding event and was very well done by staff and volunteers.  He said that something that people might not remember is the major issue we faced in allowing Owens Corning to continue operating in their facility just to the north of the CRMF.   He stated that staff should be recognized for the work they did in getting this Facility built.

Director Bagley informed the Board that on Sunday while the APTA TBM and Board Support Seminar was having their Colorado Hoe Down at Coors Field, the MAX Program had a reception at Denver Union Station.  He was able to spend about 20 minutes there on his way to Coors Field.  This program has been a major cornerstone in advancing employees and workforce development.  Director Bagley asked Interim General Manager Genova to introduce him to every RTD employee.  He said it was his honor to be there representing the RTD Board.

Director Francone thanked Paula Perdue and the Board office for their rock star work on the APTA Seminar.  She thought everything was wonderful.  It was a top notch, grade A event.

Director Anderson agreed that it was a great event.  She believes that everyone had a wonderful time.  She thought it was so nice to see old friends from all over the country and show off what Denver has to offer.  She thought the tour day was a very fun day but she was exhausted by the time she got home.

Director Lasater also agreed that the APTA Seminar was a great event.  He had the opportunity to talk with 10 to 15 Board members from all over the country and from agencies of varying sizes.  He shared that he also recently had a tour of his District with Anthony Graves from Mayor Hancock’s office.  He said Mr. Graves was extremely amazed at the amount of density being built while still having room for continued growth.

Director Deadwyler extended her kudos to the staff for the APTA Seminar.  She said it was so busy but so fun.  She received nothing but compliments from everyone she talked with.  She was so proud of the staff for showing the rest of the country how it is done in Denver.  She also extended her gratitude to Larry Buter for providing Access-a-Ride service to those in wheelchairs.

Chair Sisk shared that there were four people in wheelchairs on the Transit Oriented Communities and Flavors of BRT tour.  He thought the participants really saw the accessibility of the RTD system.  He thanked the Board for the time they committed and extended his kudos to staff.

## XVI. New Business

Director James wanted to share with the Board a new pedestrian bridge that has been kept below the radar.  It crosses I-25 a short distance east of Colorado Boulevard.  The City and County of Denver spent almost $8 million to build it and it really enhances access to our facilities.

## XVII. Adjourn

Chair Sisk adjourned the meeting at 8:06 p.m.
