STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Erin Vallejos, Acting Deputy Assistant General Manager, Bus Operations
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
Pursuant to § 32-9-119.5(2)(a), C.R.S., RTD operates a system under which up to 58% of the agency’s
non-rail vehicular service may be provided by qualified private businesses, nonprofit organizations, or
local governments pursuant to competitively negotiated contracts. The agency currently contracts
approximately 45% of its fixed-route service, 100% of complementary paratransit service (Access-aRide), and 100% of FlexRide service, for a total amount of contracted transit service of approximately
56%.
DISCUSSION
The last option year of the current contract for the provision of fixed-route bus service to the Longmont
and Boulder area expires January 9, 2026. A Request for Proposals (RFP) to replace this service package
was published using the online solicitations platform on May 7, 2025, with proposals due June 17,
2025, to allow adequate time for a comprehensive procurement process.
A panel of staff subject matter experts assessed responsive proposals using pre-determined objective
evaluative criteria. Based on the overall evaluation, the panel recommends awarding the contract to
Transdev Services, Inc., as the best value for RTD in support of the agency’s Strategic Priorities of
Community Value and Financial Success.
The service package consists of 61 buses providing approximately 165,000 revenue hours in the first
year. The routes provide service to the cities of Boulder, Erie, Lafayette, Longmont, Louisville, and

Packet Pg. 3

1.D.1

Superior, and the City and County of Broomfield. The term for the contract will be for three years, with
two one-year options, for a total of five years.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding will be included in the 2026 Budget for the provision of Longmont and Boulder fixed-route
services effective January 10, 2026. Funding for future contract years is contemplated in the agency’s
financial forecast and will be presented for the Board’s consideration annually, as identified within each
year’s respective budget.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Access-on-Demand Program Modifications

September 10, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
September 30, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve modifications to the supplemental, premium Access-on-Demand
(AoD) service for RTD’s paratransit customers as amended and described herein effective October 1,
2025.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Erin Vallejos, Acting Deputy Assistant General Manager, Bus Operations
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
On February 27, 2024, the General Manager and CEO, commissioned a peer review of RTD’s paratransit
service delivery, to be conducted by subject-matter experts selected by the American Public
Transportation Association (APTA). APTA convened the peer review panel, which included a
geographical representation of panelists from across the country. During the months-long review, the
panelists leveraged their expertise and professional experience to assess both RTD’s Access-a-Ride
(AaR) service, the agency’s complementary American with Disabilities Act (ADA) paratransit service, and
RTD’s AoD premium supplemental paratransit service.
The overarching goal of the peer review was to help the agency better understand strengths and
opportunities, with respect to both ADA complementary paratransit and premium supplemental ondemand service, and to note potential improvements that support long-term sustainability. The panel
conducted a review of RTD’s paratransit operations to identify (1) best practices employed by similar
transit agencies, including demand-response programs; (2) model program parameters, including
responsible cost controls and sound customer-facing processes; and (3) software, hardware, or other
tools to ensure optimal service performance and program cost-effectiveness.
The on-site portion of the review was conducted between May 20 and 24, 2024. In advance of the onsite visit, RTD provided the panelists with documentation for their edification. While on-site at RTD
facilities, the panelists assessed RTD’s paratransit operations through further documentation review,
field observations, and a series of briefings and interviews with agency staff, contractors, paratransit
customers, and community stakeholders. The final report formalized the panelists’ observations and
recommendations.

Packet Pg. 5

1.D.2

Staff provided the Board with a summary of program modifications that were developed as a result of
recommendations from the APTA peer review in November 2024, and after extensive public feedback,
data analysis, industry research, and a survey of other transit agencies, as well as input provided from
the Board, several iterations of recommendations have been explored.
DISCUSSION
Based on Board guidance, public outreach, and community feedback, staff recommended the following
modifications to the AoD program during the Operations, Safety, and Security Committee meeting held
on July 16, 2025:
•
•
•
•
•

$6.50 upfront base fare/$3.25 for LiVE eligible customers
$20/trip subsidy
60 trips/month cap
Service area that mirrors AaR*
Service hours that mirror AaR

*During the Operations, Safety, and Security Committee meeting on July 16, 2025, the committee
amended the proposed modification to the AoD Service Area as follows:
The AoD service area shall also include all origins and destinations that lie within three-quarters
(¾) of a mile of any RTD fixed-route bus service, including commuter and regional bus routes.
During the monthly Board meeting held on July 29, 2025, the Board made amendments to the proposed
AoD program modifications and then committed the program modifications as amended back to the
Operations, Safety, and Security Committee. This was done to allow staff time to analyze the proposed
modifications and provide the Board additional estimated cost projections for the AoD program. As of
July 29, 2025, the proposed program modifications as amended are:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Standard fare: $2.50 upfront base fare/$1.25 for LiVE eligible customers
Trip cap: 60/month
Trip subsidy: $20/trip
Service area: All locations within current RTD service area
Service window: Current AaR service hours
Waiting Period: No waiting period to begin using AoD once appropriately certified as paratransit
eligible
Multi-stop trips: Explicitly allow multi-stop trips and leave it up to individual transportation
network company (TNC) to decide whether to provide this functionality

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The financial impact of the various proposed modifications are outlined in the accompanying
memorandum designated as Attachment A and captured in the numerous program modification scenarios
detailed in the aforementioned memorandum.

Re:

Access-on-Demand: Cost Updates – CORRECTED

This memorandum serves to update the Board of Directors (Board) regarding staff’s cost projections for
various Access-on-Demand (AoD) program scenarios. These scenarios were brought forth during the
monthly Board meeting held on Tuesday, July 29, 2025. Additionally, this memorandum provides
important FY 2026 budget information that will aid the Board in determining the optimal path forward
for the program.
As illustrated herein, the AoD program has grown considerably since its inception less than five years
ago, more so than could have been anticipated. Along with that precipitous growth has come precipitous
program cost increases. In order to ensure the program remains sustainable in the long term, cost
controls must be established.
I recognize the real-world implications of the decisions the Board will need to make regarding this
program. I myself do not take lightly the responsibility of ensuring equitable transit access for people
with disabilities. I and members of my leadership team are empathetic to the diverse needs of RTD’s
customers and take great pride in providing transit services to the greater Denver region. RTD’s
functional mission as memorialized in the RTD Act is “to develop, maintain, and operate a mass
transportation system for the benefit of the inhabitants of the district.” To meet the region’s transit
needs, the agency must make sound business decisions to ensure its long-term sustainability while
simultaneously delivering excellence and value to customers and community.
History
AoD was launched as a limited pilot program available within four ZIP codes in November 2020 as part
of an expanded supplemental, premium service available to registered, eligible Access-a-Ride (AaR)
customers. The program’s goal was to provide a responsive, on-demand platform for paratransit
customers, which was similar to the agency’s Access-a-Cab program as it existed at that time. While
AaR remains an accessible paratransit option for individuals who cannot use AoD for a variety of reasons
(e.g., certain individuals require door-to-door service while others are unbanked or unable to use apps
to book ride share trips, etc.), AoD provides a viable, convenient transit option for a significant number
of individuals with disabilities who have come to rely on RTD as their mobility provider of choice.

1.D.2.a

Following a successful pilot, the Access-a-Cab and AoD programs were merged, and the Board approved
an initial not-to-exceed (NTE) amount of $9.3 million for three years commencing January 2023. Since
that time, the Board has approved increases to the total program not-to-exceed (NTE) amount, which
now stands at $37.8 million through December 31, 2025, a four-fold increase from the original projection
due largely to the popularity of the AoD program.

2026 AoD Scenarios
In an effort to maintain consistency, assumptions regarding project costs and parameters have been
presented in a similar manner since the start of discussions in November 2024; however, this has created
the possible misconception that the cost controls under consideration would yield either cost savings or
increased revenue for the agency in 2025, when in fact the program costs will eclipse the amount
budgeted. To better illustrate the impacts of each scenario, this memorandum highlights projected costs
for each of the scenarios as contemplated in the 2026 Budget. Projections have been developed based
on a variety of historical data and assumptions relative to customer behavior based on the associated
fare. Following are further details for each scenario.
Information previously presented to the Board has illustrated the actual trip subsidy paid by RTD to the
four service providers and has not, prior to the dissemination of this memorandum, included the
Wheelchair Accessible Vehicle (WAV) costs that should also be considered as part of the overall program
costs. These costs have been included in the scenarios as described.

WAV Cost

(Note: For comparison, factoring in WAV costs, staff anticipates a total annual AoD program cost of

$24,826,448 in 2025. This total assumes a sustained average monthly increase of 3.8% in customer
demand, with the average customer taking 22 trips per month within existing program parameters.)
2026 Budget
While the 2026 Budget is still being developed, staff anticipates that significant reductions in budgeted
operating expenses will be required to ensure fiscal sustainability and prudent stewardship of taxpayer
dollars, given RTD’s change in net position from +$19M in 2023 to -$282M in 2024.
Should sufficient operating expense savings not be realized in the 2026 Budget, fixed-route service
modifications would be necessary beginning in 2026. For purposes of the 2026 Budget, each 1%
reduction in annualized fixed-route bus service delivery would yield a budgetary offset of approximately
$4 million in operating costs.
Simply put, an increase in program costs of approximately $13.1 million, i.e., the difference in program
costs between staff’s recommended scenario presented in July 2025 and Scenario 6 as described, would
necessitate an equivalent reduction of approximately 3.3% in fixed-route bus service. For comparison,
the relative costs to operate the following highly utilized bus routes in 2024, the costs for which are
comparable to the cost variance among the above scenarios:

For further context, the anticipated AaR budget for the provision of services in 2026 is $53,419,030.
This cost is in addition to any AoD costs outlined above.
Impacts to AaR
As discussed during the monthly Board meeting held on Tuesday, July 29, 2025, WAV vehicles used for
AoD service are provided by RTD through the agency’s existing AaR service contracts. As demand for
AoD, and subsequently WAV service, increases, the service capacity of RTD’s federally mandated
complimentary paratransit service decreases correspondingly. Additionally, the demand for WAV trips
provided through both AaR and AoD services continues to increase; for AoD specifically, demand has
risen from a daily average of 79 trips in January 2025 to 116 in July 2025, a 47% increase. During this
same period in 2025, monthly AaR on-time performance has decreased, from over 90% in January-April
2025, down to 86% by the end of July 2025. Staff attributes this performance decline at least partially
to the impact of AoD WAV trip demands on AaR service.
I along with staff look forward to continued discussion regarding this matter during the Operations,
Safety, and Security Meeting scheduled for Wednesday, September 10, 2025, and, if approved, the
monthly Board meeting scheduled for Tuesday, September 30, 2025.
Thank you.

Memorandum

1.D.2.b

The committee amended the proposed program modifications to the AoD service area to include all origins and
destinations that lie within 0.75 miles of any RTD fixed-route bus service, including commuter and regional bus
routes.
During the monthly Board meeting held on Tuesday, July 29, 2025, the Board further amended the proposed AoD
program modifications and later referred the program modifications agenda item, as amended, to the Operations,
Safety, and Security Committee to be considered in September 2025. This was done to allow staff time to analyze
the revised modifications and provide to the Board estimated cost projections for the AoD program given the
amended modifications.
Given the increased program costs associated with all other scenarios contemplated by the Board, staff’s
recommendation is for the Board to adopt the program parameters highlighted above, not to include the change
to the service area boundaries adopted by the committee on July 16, 2025. If approved, these program
modifications would go into effect January 1, 2026, to allow staff sufficient time to coordinate with third-party
AoD service providers prior to implementation, as well as leverage a communications campaign to educate and
inform customers of the forthcoming modifications.

effective January 1, 2026, through June 30, 2026, raising the not-to-exceed (NTE) amount from $37.8
million to $47.2 million.

PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
In January 2023, RTD’s AoD program, a premium, supplemental paratransit service available via four
contracted private providers, was expanded to all eligible Access-a-Ride (AaR) customers. These
contracts were for a three-year contract term that is set to expire December 31, 2025. When these
contracts were approved by the Board of Directors in November 2022, the original NTE for the full threeyear period was $9.3 million.
To ensure customers continue to have equitable and sustainable access to the agency’s services, RTD
commissioned a peer review of the agency’s paratransit service delivery in February 2024. The on-site
review was conducted by industry subject-matter experts (SMEs) in May 2024. These SMEs engaged in
a holistic review of the paratransit program, including both the AoD program and the AaR program. As
part of the review, changes to the AoD program were suggested.
Staff has developed a draft solicitation for new AoD contracts to replace the existing contracts set to
expire, but finalization of the terms of that solicitation is dependent upon Board approval of AoD
program modifications being recommended by staff concurrently with this action. Staff will incorporate
the Board approved modifications into the solicitation and intends to advertise no later than November 7,
2025. This will allow sufficient time for proposers to develop proposals, for the Board of Directors to
consider recommended actions to effectuate the contract extensions, and for the execution of contracts
prior to the term date of the extensions. Program modifications approved by the Board will be
incorporated into these amendments if this recommended action is adopted.

In adopting this recommended action, RTD seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan Priority of
Customer Excellence. This recommendation allows registered, eligible customers to continue using AoD
while new contracts are solicited.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for the provision of AoD services effective January 1 through June 30, 2026, will be included in
the 2026 Proposed Budget as presented to the Board of Directors for approval.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
2026 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP)

September 10, 2025

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Timothy Tyran, Director, Safety and Environmental Compliance/Chief Safety Officer
Sky Mott, Manager, Safety Management Systems Program Development, Safety and Environmental
Compliance
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) requires any public transportation operator receiving federal
funds through the Urbanized Area Formula Grants program to develop a PTASP. The plan must outline
the processes and procedures needed to implement a Safety Management System (SMS).
While the FTA sets the regulatory framework for PTASP compliance, federal and state law designate the
Colorado Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) as the State Safety Oversight Agency for the RTD system.
The CPUC has the primary responsibility to enforce program standards, review annual PTASP updates,
and approve the plan. Once approved, the CPUC certifies to the FTA that the PTASP meets all current
federal requirements. The PTASP, and each subsequent update, must be signed by the General Manager
and CEO (GM/CEO) as the Accountable Executive and approved first by the Joint Labor-Management
Safety Committee (JLMSC), and then by the Board of Directors.
DISCUSSION
The updates to the 2026 PTASP as compared to the 2025 Board-approved version include:
•
•
•

Three-year rolling average and target for safety performance indicators as reported to the National
Transit Database as required by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law
Updates to reporting criteria for accidents and hazards under CPUC program standards
Roadway Worker Protection manual related to protection of employees and contractors

Staff will bring forward during the October 2025 meeting cycle the final GM/CEO and JLMSC-approved
PTASP for the Board’s consideration of staff’s recommended action.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The adoption of the 2026 PTASP will not result in any direct financial impact.

1.1

Policy

The first element of the Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP) is Safety Policy. This, in its most
simple form, is the safety policy developed, approved, and signed by the Regional Transportation District
(RTD), a multimodal agency comprising bus, light rail, commuter rail, and special services in the Denver
metro area. This element also describes the agency’s commitment to safety; its objectives, safety goals,
and the organizational structure established; and plans written to obtain these goals and objectives.
In August 2021, the RTD Board of Directors adopted a new strategic plan that looks toward the next five
years of the agency’s future. The document — against which all initiatives, projects, and priorities are
measured — serves as a blueprint for success and outlines the intentionality the agency will bring with its
redefined mission: We make lives better through connections.
The strategic plan was developed by General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) Debra A. Johnson and RTD’s
executive leadership team in concert with the agency’s 15-member Board of Directors. It establishes four
strategic priorities — community value, customer excellence, employee ownership, and financial
success — that serve as functional pillars to plan, develop, evaluate, and measure overall performance.
Development of the PTASP was completed in accordance with the strategic plan; Title 49 Code of Federal
Regulations (CFR) Parts 670, 671, 672, 673, and 674; and Colorado Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) State
Safety Oversight (SSO) Program Procedures and Standards.
The agency has adopted a Safety Management System (SMS) approach to administering safety throughout
the organization. SMS is flexible and scalable and consists of four elements:
SMS Element

Description

Safety Policy

Definition of safety policies, procedures, and organizational structure

Safety Risk Management

Formal process for management of hazards to an acceptable level of risk

Safety Assurance

Establishment of process measures, assessments, and controls to assess the
effectiveness of risk control strategies

Safety Promotion

Safety training and risk communication practices to promote a culture of safety

1.1.2

Authority

RTD is a special transportation district and political subdivision of the state of Colorado and is authorized
under Colorado Revised Statutes Title 32, Article 9. As such, the district has its own taxing authority and
operates within the counties of Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Broomfield, Denver, Douglas, Jefferson, and
Weld. The agency is governed by its elected Board of Directors and managed by the GM/CEO, who
develops and implements a comprehensive and integrated PTASP. To that end, the GM/CEO, by signature
authority of the district’s Safety Policy Statement, has authorized the RTD chief safety officer (CSO) to
develop and implement a PTASP as an operating document of the agency for the operations of light rail,
bus and paratransit.

1. POLICY

The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) recognizes the CPUC as the state safety oversight agency for RTD.
CPUC is FTA’s certified state safety oversight agency (SSOA), working cooperatively to regulate RTD’s light
rail transit, by ensuring compliance with state and federal requirements, regulations, and guidance,
as applicable.
The FTA functions as both a funding administrator and as a federal regulator as defined by 49 CFR Parts
670, 671, 672, 673, and 674. The FTA conducts regular reviews of the SSOA, to determine the SSO’s and
RTD’s compliance to the FTA’s general requirements. RTD’s light rail service is regulated by the FTA
and CPUC.

1.1.3

Policy Statement

As the accountable executive for all operations and activities, I will ensure that resources are available to
make the SMS robust and successful. Executive leadership will take steps to prevent workplace incidents,
injuries, and illnesses and will provide support of safety program initiatives. The agency will consider
employee suggestions for achieving a safer, healthier workplace; keep informed about workplace safety
and health hazards; and regularly review the agency’s safety programs.
The agency is committed to:
●

Integrating safety management among the primary responsibilities of all managers and employees

●

1.E.1.b

All employees are expected and encouraged to participate in safety activities, including reporting hazards,
unsafe work practices, near misses, and accidents immediately to their supervisor or a safety committee/
department representative.
Disciplinary action will not be taken against an employee who acts to prevent an injury or who reports any
accident, incident, near miss, concern, or hazard to any level of management. All employees are required
to abide by the standards and procedures set forth in the SMS policy and employees of bus and light rail
adhere to the PTASP as well. Behaviors such as illegal activity, negligence, acts of willful misconduct, or
undue care and attention shall be considered outside the scope of this policy.

1.E.1.b

The overall consideration in the development of the agency’s PTASP is to provide safe and reliable
movement of customers throughout the transit system. Customers and the general public must be
confident that the RTD transit system is a safe system. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to design,
construct, operate, and maintain a system that aims to reduce recognized hazards as much as practicable
with the safety of employees, customers, and the general public in mind. The agency’s objectives will be
met by drawing information from system observation, local and state codes, federal guidelines, and specific
agency requirements into an SMS to ensure a safe transportation system.
The agency will track the following safety performance measures as required by the National Public
Transportation Safety Plan:
●

Fatalities (total number of reportable fatalities and rate per total vehicle revenue miles by mode)

●

Injuries (total number of reportable injuries and rate per total vehicle revenue miles by mode)

●

Major Events (total number of major safety and security reportable events and rate per total vehicle
revenue miles by mode)

●

System Reliability (mean distance between major mechanical failures by mode)

Agency Safety Policies

Guided by the principles contained in this PTASP, the CSO, under the direction of the GM/CEO, develops,
reviews, and updates safety and risk control policies, processes, and procedures. These policies set the
framework for guiding the SMS. All agency safety policies are available on the intranet.

1.2.3

Integrating Safety into All Aspects of RTD

The objective of the SMS is the continual improvement of processes and operations to maximize safety to
the highest practicable level. This effort is undertaken by providing continual opportunities for employees
to be reminded of safety, incorporate safe practices into their operations, and supply each employee with
multiple means to identify potential hazards.
The agency accomplishes this through safety training, safety moments at meetings, safety committee
meetings, weekly safety messages, safety campaigns, identification and mitigation of hazards, and
proactive reviews and inspections to identify potential hazards.
Within different departments, multiple means of incorporating safety concerns or representation
are presented. As examples:
● Safety and Environmental Compliance representative is a part of Planning Department
meetings to plan for safety in new projects at the earliest opportunity
●

Safety and Environmental Compliance representative participates in Transit Oriented Communities
meetings to identify and raise safety concerns

●

In new construction projects, safety is considered in the Design and Construction Meeting, System
Safety Working Group, Activation Committee and/or other processes where relevant

●

Safety and Environmental Compliance representative is in the Technology Architectural
Governance (TAC) regarding the selection and implementation of new technology programs

●

Safety and Environmental Compliance representative works with Communications and
Engagement for signage, vehicle wraps, handouts, billboards, advertisements, and social media to
maximize safety messages to the community

●

Safety is incorporated into training in divisions, such as Roadway Worker Protection, Safety
Management System, and Security/Incident Command Structure training

●

Safety and Environmental Compliance representative reviews procurements that involve safetysensitive products or services and ensures proper safety language is in all contracts

1.3.1

RTD Board of Directors and Executive Leadership

RTD was created by the Colorado General Assembly in 1969 for the purpose of providing a public mass
transportation system for residents of the district. The agency began operations in 1972. A 15-member
elected Board of Directors is the legislative body for the agency and determines all questions of overall
governance and policy. The Board of Directors appoints the GM/CEO, who is ultimately responsible for safety.
The GM/CEO has full charge of the acquisition, construction, maintenance, and operations of the system
and facilities of the agency, and of the administration of business affairs. The GM/CEO supervises executive
leadership, including Deputy CEO and Chief Officers. Included among these officers is the chief operations
officer (COO), who is responsible for bus, rail and paratransit operations and directly supervises the Deputy
Chief Operations Officers (DCOO). The CSO has the responsibility for agency safety and meets monthly
and as needed with the GM/CEO.
The following activities ensure that safety goals and objectives are achieved:
●

Perform timely review of accident and incident investigation summary reports to identify trends and
recommend corrective action to minimize loss

●

Review reports of system standard operating procedures (SOPs) and rules for compliance with
established guidelines

●

Review summary reports regarding periodic equipment and facility inspections, and system
hazard analysis

●

Promote safety awareness by incorporating customer and employee involvement

1.3.2

Management — Key Role in Safety Overview

The SMS will be incorporated into every aspect of transit services, by rail and bus service managers.
Safe operations of the bus and rail divisions are the responsibility of the COO and DCOOs. The bus and
rail departments each have a DCOO. Other departments have a Chief Officer who, along with senior
managers, managers, and supervisors, is responsible for implementing policies and procedures for safe
operations. The DCOOs of the rail and bus divisions have charged their management teams to effectively
manage safety; to develop safety programs, plans, procedures, training, policies and rules to govern
safety; and to fully comply with the PTASP. Bus and rail maintenance facilities are staffed with a Manager of
Maintenance responsible for the safe operation of their employees within the facility and are supported by
Shift Supervisors and maintenance workers. The agency models policies, procedures, and processes for
occupational safety and health on Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations.
Supervisors’ responsibilities place them at the forefront of safety efforts. A significant portion of their duties
is monitoring, ensuring, and emphasizing safety performance and rules compliance and promoting a strong
safety climate. All employees are charged with adhering to safety, but supervisors are the key to improved
safety-related behavior and positive safety outcomes. Supervisors have the responsibility to monitor safety
compliance of their employees and ensure employees understand their job functions and the associated
safety requirements.
Safety and health are managed at all levels of staff. All employees are trained in safety and job duties, and
are given responsibility for their own safety, as well as the safety of the individuals with whom they work.
All employees have the responsibility to halt an operation or stop work if it is deemed to be unsafe. System
safety processes emphasize open and consistent dialogue between leaders and subordinates to increase

Management — Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan

The GM/CEO, having authorized and endorsed the program and resulting plans, processes, and
procedures, has delegated the responsibility to update and implement the PTASP to the CSO. The Safety
and Environmental Compliance Division carries responsibility to oversee the writing and development
of the PTASP, to conduct annual updates and revisions and to disseminate the PTASP document in
accordance with CPUC Program Standards, and 49 CFR Part 673, General Requirements.
The PTASP is reviewed with and distributed to the GM/CEO, DCEO, chief officers, and DCOOs. The PTASP
is also distributed to members of the other safety committees and portions of the document are reviewed
with new employees. The PTASP is made available to all employees on the agency intranet, the Hub.

1.3.5

Climate/Geography

The Denver metro region normally has a semi-arid continental climate with four well-defined seasons.
Summers are characterized by hot, dry weather, but the high temperatures are usually not oppressive
since the relative humidity is generally low and the nights usually cool. August is the hottest month, with
temperatures reading 90-100 degrees Fahrenheit. Winters are cold but usually not severe. The average
annual snowfall is less than 65 inches at Denver International Airport, but much higher amounts fall in
foothill locations. Precipitation is generally light during the summer and early fall but may be heavy in the
spring when storms from the Pacific Ocean move through the area more frequently than any other season
of the year.
The agency’s transit services extend throughout the Front Range area at a width of approximately 60
miles between Pine Junction and Denver International Airport. The north-south coverage area ranges from
Longmont to Lone Tree, a distance of 70 miles. Service areas include the foothills situated along the Front
Range of the Rocky Mountains. Elevations range from approximately 4,850 feet above sea level to greater
than 9,000 feet above sea level in the foothills.

1.4 PTASP Annual Updates, Revisions,
and Changes

1.E.1.b

Continuous improvement is a process by which a transit agency examines safety performance to identify
safety deficiencies or deficiencies in the agency’s safety performance against Safety Risk Reduction
Program performance targets and carries out a plan to address the identified
safety deficiencies.
The Leadership Safety Committee and the JLMSC meet regularly throughout the year to review the current
performance of the agency against the safety performance targets and the strategic plan objectives and to
take action to address any safety deficiencies that are identified.
The agency will use the management review cycle (annual PTASP update), JLMSC review cycle, along
with performance data for the SMS and Internal Safety Reviews to identify and prioritize continuous
improvement of each process. Leadership, from the accountable executive to managers, is involved in
this management review cycle. The agency will develop and carry out a plan to address any deficiencies
identified through the annual safety performance assessment. This method is consistent with SMS
principles and allows for the resourcing and prioritization of SMS efforts.

1.6 SMS Documentation and Records
Documentation and recordkeeping pertinent to each component or subcomponent of SMS is described
in the relevant section of the SMS. This subcomponent will also include changes for the management of
new or revised safety requirements from regulations or otherwise, such as the introduction of minimum
standards for safety. In addition, this subcomponent includes safety data and analyses, delivered to and
used by management for safety-related decision-making.
All documents included, attached, or referenced, describing the programs, policies and procedures used
to implement this PTASP, will be maintained for a minimum of three years. All documents will be made
available to the FTA, federal entities, or the SSOA upon request.

1.5 Continuous Improvement

1.E.1.b

1.7.1

Emergency Preparedness and Response

The ability to respond quickly and in an organized manner is vital to the continuation of transit service
during a special event, emergency, or recovery from a catastrophic incident, including, but not limited to,
the following:
●

Earthquake

●

Fire

●

Flooding

●

Hazardous material spill

●

Medical emergency

●

Severe weather

●

Pandemic

●

Transit-related accidents

●

Acts of violence

●

Acts of terrorism

The Emergency Operations Base Plan (EOBP) provides a flexible framework for districtwide emergency
management (See Exhibit for Plan). Each mode (light rail, commuter rail, fixed-route and on-demand
bus) will develop and update its specific emergency response plan. These plans detail activities and
responsibilities for personnel. This plan, along with the safety program documents and SSP, describes
coordination of the following emergency preparedness/management activities:
●

Incident management – management of an emergency event or incident is based on the principles
of National Incident Management System (NIMS) and the Incident Command System (ICS). NIMS
principles allow emergency response agencies to communicate with field supervisors and/or
Transit Police Communications

●

Coordination with external agencies – the Chief of Police and Emergency Management is
principally responsible for the coordination of incident management resources with various
emergency service agencies to provide for effective interaction between RTD and those agencies.
Liaising with law enforcement agencies is primarily the responsibility of the CSO, with assistance
from the Chief of Police and Emergency Management with assistance from the CSO

●

Emergency response planning and mitigation – the agency establishes a Fire Life Safety
Committee (FLSC) for each new rail extension or significant transit facility project. The
committee comprises safety and security staff; RTD operations, maintenance, and engineering
representatives; and police, fire, emergency medical, and other area emergency response agency
representatives. The committee reviews transit system designs and recommends fire protection,
life safety and security measures, and procedural response and training needs related to the new
extension or facility project

●

Emergency planning – As a critical transportation provider in the Denver metropolitan area, the
agency is a member of the Regional Emergency Management and the Continuity of Operations
Plan (COOP) and Urban Area Security Initiative. It is the agency’s intent to collaborate with regional
emergency management agencies responsible for emergency preparedness, response, recovery,
and mitigation planning and coordination among the counties and cities in the metropolitan
area, emergency response agencies, utility companies, and other critical groups. The agency,

15

Packet Pg. 59

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_2026 [Revision 1] (5178 : 2026 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

1.7 Emergency Preparedness and Response

with assistance from the FLSC, has developed emergency management operating plans and
procedures to address a wide range of emergency incidents and events, including criminal activity,
earthquakes, fire at transit stations and along the rights-of-way, hazardous materials releases,
medical emergencies, severe weather, terrorism, transportation mishaps, and other emergency
situations occurring within the transit system
●

Emergency preparedness exercises – A minimum of one emergency tabletop or field exercise
across different RTD modes will be planned and conducted annually to ensure the adequacy of
emergency plans and procedures. These may include readiness of personnel to perform under
emergency conditions; effective coordination between RTD and emergency response agencies;
and coordination of regional emergency exercises that are facilitated through use of Tera software
or other means. All exercises are followed by after-action analyses and reports to document
lessons learned and actions needed to improve the agency’s emergency operations capabilities

●

Emergency response training – Frontline RTD transportation and maintenance personnel
will undergo emergency response training to ensure full understanding of their roles and
responsibilities during an emergency incident. The level of training will be based on their
anticipated role during the incident. At a minimum, training is provided on the emergency plans
and procedures that the employee may be required to implement. Training to familiarize fire,
rescue, and other emergency service personnel with special transit system requirements is
coordinated through the FLSC, Transit Police and Emergency Management Department, and Safety
and Environmental Compliance Division staff, with assistance from the Bus and Light Rail Divisions,
as appropriate.

1.7.2

Public Health Emergency Management and Response

The agency will identify mitigations or strategies to minimize the exposure of the public, personnel
and property to hazards and unsafe conditions, and consistent with the guidelines of the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or a state or local public health authority, will minimize exposure to
infectious diseases and comply with the CDC and state and local public health orders during public health
emergencies or pandemics.

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT

The second element of the PTASP is risk management process, which addresses how the agency identifies,
assesses, tracks, and mitigates hazards and risk in the agency and on the transit systems for light rail, bus
and paratransit. Tolerable risk levels, performance targets, and mitigation measures are established.

2.1 Risk Management Program
2.1.1

Risk Management

Effective risk management helps the agency serve its customers, employees, and the district by ensuring
that the agency provides excellence in:
●

Community Value

●

Customer Excellence

●

Employee Ownership

●

Financial Success

Executive leadership is committed to:
●

Understanding risk in the context of the frequency (likelihood) and severity (consequence) of
events that can or do happen to guide agency actions that support delivery on the agency’s
objectives within fiscal, ethical, regulatory, and other practical constraints

●

Transparency regarding the tradeoffs between risks, costs, and performance inherent in all decisions

●

Using clearly defined agency strategies, objectives, operational plans, and processes in the
identification, evaluation, mitigation, and acceptance of risk

●

Optimizing limited resources to meet objectives

2.1.1.1

Hazard Management

Chiefs/DCOOs play a key role in the hazard management process and ensure that the process has been
fully integrated within their departments. Chiefs/DCOOs also ensure that the following elements of the
hazard management process are present in their departments:
●

Ensure employees can report hazards to management in person or using the electronic hazard
reporting form via the intranet

●

Ensure hazards are placed on the safety risk register for tracking and documentation

●

Represent management, or select designee to represent management, on a site committee

●

Ensure each hazard has been assigned to a specific individual/point of contact

●

Participate in assigning hazard ratings, in accordance with the Risk Assessment Matrix

●

Ensure employees receive appropriate hazard management training

2.

2.1.1.2

Safety Risk Register

Site senior managers, managers, and supervisors, along with TSSs, ensure that the safety risk register
is used to track hazards. The safety risk register is to be maintained and are reviewed by the site
safety committee on a monthly basis. Hazards placed on the safety risk register receive their initial and
final hazard ratings using the Risk Assessment Matrix. These individuals may give hazards their initial
rating when hazards are received and final ratings when they are closed. This same group may also
present hazards to the site safety committee for hazard ratings or employ the Safety and Environmental
Compliance Division for assistance in rating hazards. Hazard ratings may be changed with new
information or as a result of data analysis.
TSSs are responsible for the maintenance of safety risk register. They ensure that hazards meeting defined
criteria are entered into the appropriate category within the hazard reporting system for accurate record
keeping. Hazard rating should be developed with input from the Safety and Environmental Compliance
Division, site senior managers, managers, and supervisors. The following are specific hazards that are
identified and mitigated at the agency level:
●

Unacceptable or undesirable hazards (high and serious hazards)

●

Hazards identified from reviews from outside agencies (CPUC, FTA, OSHA)

●

Hazards identified from safety event investigations

●

Hazards with significant property damage

●

High-potential events as determined by the Safety and Environmental Compliance Division

When a hazard is identified as needing mitigation that requires cost or changes beyond that of the site
safety committee or department abilities, the hazard will be elevated.

2.1.1.3

Corrective Action Plan (CAP)

CAPs are used for hazards that meet certain criteria:
●

Hazards with a Risk Assessment Code of 1A, 2A, 1B, 2B (high risk), or 1C, 2C, 3A, 3B (serious risk)

●

Findings of noncompliance from internal safety reviews or safety reviews or audits by regulatory
agencies (CPUC, FTA, OSHA)

●

Corrective action resulting from accident safety event investigations

●

High-potential events as determined by the Safety and Environmental Compliance Division

In the following instances, CAPs must receive prior approval by the CPUC before mitigation activities
may begin:
●

Hazards with a Risk Assessment Code of 1A, 2A, 1B, or 2B (high risk) or 1C, 2C, 3A, 3B (serious risk)

●

Findings from regulatory agencies resulting in non-conformance (CPUC, FTA)

●

Findings from internal safety reviews or audits resulting in non-conformance

●

Safety event investigations requiring corrective action

20

Packet Pg. 64

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_2026 [Revision 1] (5178 : 2026 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

1.E.1.b

For testing or reviews of industrial hygiene that potentially exceed Permissible Exposure Limits for hazards
that do not meet the Unacceptable Risk Assessment Codes of 1A, 2A, 1B, or 2B (high risk), SSOA staff will
review and preliminarily approve the CAP before safety risk mitigation activities are implemented.
If an emergency corrective action must be taken immediately to ensure safety, the SSOA must be notified
of the issue immediately, and the agency must follow up with the SSOA for subsequent review and
approval of the corrective action within five business days.
The SSOA will review and provide final approval of all CAPs on a quarterly basis.
CAPs are assigned a specific tracking number by the Electronic Hazard Reporting System and are linked
with their associated hazard. CAPs must contain at a minimum:
●

The action(s) to be taken to minimize, control, correct, or eliminate the risks and hazards identified

●

A person of responsibility for the corrective action

●

A proposed completion date

●

Plan approval when applicable

CAPs are developed by department managers/designee in conjunction with the Safety and Environmental
Compliance Division. The Safety and Environmental Compliance Division will facilitate the CAP process is
followed and properly track CAPs until closed.

2.1.5

Hazard Process Overview

The hazard process includes all facilities, light rail, and bus systems. The hazard management flowchart
lays out an overall description of how hazards are identified, evaluated, analyzed, controlled or eliminated,
tracked, and reported to leadership and CPUC.
●

TSSs are the primary points of contact for the hazard management process

●

Safety committee members for light rail and bus will be able to identify, evaluate, and
analyze hazards

●

The TSSs will assist in entering identified hazards into the electronic hazard reporting system

●

The TSS facilitate development of mitigations for each unacceptable and undesirable hazard entry,
identify a point of contact or owner of the hazard, and place this information within the hazard
reporting system for tracking purposes

●

CAPs may also be identified as a result of an incident and investigation

●

Safety committee members also participate in the evaluation and control or elimination of the hazard

●

Hazards must be mitigated at the lowest level possible. However, when a hazard is identified as
having a mitigation that involves multiple departments or requires cost or changes beyond the
safety committee or department abilities or budgets, the hazard is elevated to higher level.

●

Recommendations/results from contractor or internal review, testing, or industrial or environmental
sampling results requiring corrective actions will be placed in the safety risk register for follow
up and possible need for retesting for compliance with Safety or Environmental requirements. If
mitigation or control of a hazard is not achieved at the lowest practicable level possible, the hazard
mitigation process may be elevated to the Leadership Safety Committee.

2.1.5.1

Hazard Identiﬁcation

Identifying hazards is the responsibility of all employees and contractors. The continuous identification,
monitoring, and mitigation of hazards is key to an effective safety program.
Hazard identification methods include, but are not limited to:
●

Observation, inspection, and interaction with all employees and contractors

●

Review of reports from safety committee members, customers, and customer service and field personnel

●

Evaluation of accidents, incidents, and near misses, to include data trends and projections

●

Conducting Preliminary Hazard Analysis (PHA) of a design or new construction

●

Conducting safety certification, system integration testing, pre-revenue testing, system
modification, configuration management verification, and inspection processes

●

Conducting Operation Hazard Analysis (OHA) of revenue operations

●

Review of internal and external safety reviews, inspections, observations, defects, findings,
observations, violations, and reviews

●

Review of controller logs, daily operating clearances/bulletins, and training feedback

●

“Lesson learned” inputs

●

Review of applicable regulatory codes and standards

●

Review of National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), FTA, OSHA safety recommendations,
guidance, initiatives, and alerts

●

Review of Nonconformance Reports, Corrective Action Reports

●

Review of data and information provided by the SSOA

The Hazard Management Flow Chart (in the attached Exhibit) will be followed by employees in identifying
and correcting hazards at the employee/supervisor level. Actions will be taken to move the hazard to the
safety committee and beyond if necessary.

2.1.5.2 Hazard Investigation, Assessment, and Analysis
The agency is currently developing and refining a database where safety events and observed hazards can
be centrally tracked and analyzed for leading indicators of potential hazards. This will allow management to
be proactive in correcting hazards.
Safety concerns are identified and corrected at the lowest level as soon as practicable. Safety concerns
that are not eliminated at this level are reported to a supervisor or a TSS. Reported concerns will be
assessed by a TSS and/or safety committee to determine if a safety hazard exists and assign an initial
hazard rating. Hazards will be evaluated and risks will be ranked to ensure prioritization for elimination or
control as described in the ORM framework.

2.1.5.3 Causal Factor, Analysis and Safety Event Evaluation
Hazards are investigated following the Event Notification, Reporting and Investigation Policy and Procedure
to determine causal and contributing factors of an event, or hazard, for purpose of preventing recurrence

22

Packet Pg. 66

1.E.1.b

and mitigating risk. Hazards originating from events are reviewed by TSSs, managers and supervisors, and
respective safety committees. A third-party expert may assist with an investigation if deemed necessary.
The level of investigation and the methodology used will be determined based upon risk assessments.
HIGH risk hazards (1A, 1B, 2A, 2B) that receive an unacceptable initial hazard analysis made by
management, a safety committee, or a TSS receive immediate attention/control. A high rating requires
corrective action. Hazards that receive a high rating will be elevated.
SERIOUS hazards (1C, 2C, 3A, 3B) that are undesirable may require corrective action and decisions by
management. Hazards that receive a serious hazard rating will be elevated.
MEDIUM (1D, 1E, 2D, 3C, 4A, 4B, 5A) hazards may be acceptable with review and documentation
by management.
MODERATE (2E, 3D, 4C, 5B) hazards are acceptable with review.
LOW (3E, 4D, 4E, 5C, 5D, 5E) hazards do not require review and are acceptable.

2.1.5.4 Hazard Reporting Threshold to Colorado Public Utilities Commission
The agency will notify CPUC of all identified hazards in the light rail system during monthly/quarterly
reporting. The agency will notify CPUC in a timely manner of all hazardous conditions that affect the
immediate safety of the light rail system. At a minimum, the agency notifies CPUC not later than 24 hours
from the earlier of the time of discovery or the determination of the risk assessment code, according to the
notification procedures in the CPUC standard, of the rating of the hazardous conditions as High or Serious
and set forth in the transit agency’s Hazard Identification/Resolution Matrix:
●

1A (Catastrophic/Frequent)

●

2A (Severe/Frequent)

●

1B (Catastrophic/Probable)

●

2B (Severe/Probable)

●

1C (Catastrophic/Remote)

The agency is responsible for assigning severity/probability ratings to hazardous conditions.
The agency will include in its hazard management process hazardous conditions, incidents, occurrences,
and events, including:
●

Incidents involving individuals working in the RTD-controlled right-of-way that are investigated by
the agency

●

Malfunctions of safety-critical systems that could result, or have resulted, in catastrophic or
single-point failure

●

Broken or missing safety-critical equipment, infrastructure, or systems that could result, or have
resulted, in employee or customer injury, or damage to the agency property

2.1.5.5 Operational Risk Assessment Matrix
Assessing risk is the process of determining the severity of risk and the probability of the risk being
realized. To ensure risk assessments are consistent, it is important to use a standard definition.
Severity is a quantitative or subjective measure of the worst credible mishap resulting from personnel
error, environmental conditions, design inadequacies and/or procedural efficiencies for system,
subsystem or component failure or malfunction. Severity is categorized as Catastrophic, Severe, Serious,
Limited, or Negligible.
Probability is defined as the likelihood of the number of times that a specific event will occur during
the planned life expectancy of a system. A risk probability may be derived from the analysis of a transit
system’s operating experience, evaluation of safety historical data, or the analysis of reliability and failure
data. Probability is categorized as Frequent, Probable, Remote, Improbable or Highly Improbable.

Using the determined severity and probability, the risk assessment matrix is used to determine the risk
index. The risk ratings will be labeled as High, Serious, Medium, Moderate, or Low. The required action to
mitigate the risk will then be evaluated to apply the appropriate control measures and/or mitigation actions.

The required resolution action is based on the determined risk level.
Risks that have been evaluated and ranked will be mitigated at the lowest feasible level. Mitigation actions
that exceed funding levels authorized at each level will be elevated to the next higher level for action.

2.1.5.6 Hazard Control and Tracking
Safety critical hazards that have been identified must be controlled or mitigated so that the hazard does
not continue to pose a danger. This may be done in a temporary manner if the hazard is controlled. The
process of controlling and tracking hazards is recorded on the safety risk register, which is generated from
the electronic hazard reporting system. The portions of the safety risk register applicable to the light rail
system are discussed monthly with the CPUC.
Depending upon the risk ranking, safety risk register entries may require a mitigation plan or CAP, tracking
number, brief description, projected completion date, and an initial hazard/risk rating (IHR/IRR) using the
Risk Assessment Matrix.
CAPs include:
●

Element of activity identified as deficient

●

Planned activities to resolve deficiency

●

Department responsible for implementing corrective action

●

Scheduled completion date for implementation

Safety risk register entries with their associated CAP are reviewed regularly by the Safety and
Environmental Compliance Division, safety committees, and CPUC. They are periodically reviewed by
Leadership Safety Committee. CAPs may be tracked and sorted from the tracking log. When a CAP is
closed, the tracking log will reflect this action and a closed date.
Individual CAP files are stored by tracking number.

2.1.5.7 Hazard Resolution
Hazard resolution refers to the methods and processes to identify mitigation strategies necessary to
reduce the likelihood and severity of the consequences associated with an identified hazard to the lowest
level practicable. Hazard resolution is not synonymous with hazard elimination. In a transit environment,
some hazards are impossible to eliminate and others are highly impractical to eliminate. Reduction of risk
to the lowest practical level can be accomplished in a variety of ways, from protective and warning devices
to special procedures. The hierarchy of controls will be followed to achieve a tolerable risk level:
1.

Elimination – remove the hazard

2. Substitution – replacement of material or a process with another that is considered
less hazardous
3.

Engineering Controls – isolate people from the risk

4.

2.1.5.8 Hazard Tracking
Each CAP developed for hazards or findings from investigations or deficiencies will be submitted to
CPUC for review and approval. The CAP form is automatically assigned a tracking number and placed
on the tracking log with its identified hazard. Upon completion of the corrective action, the Safety and
Environmental Compliance Division will submit to CPUC as required. The completed CAP is formally
adopted by receiving CPUC’s signature. The tracking log will then be updated to show the status of the
identified hazard and its CAP.
The agency will monitor all CAPs and provide CPUC with quarterly updates on the tracking log.
Internally, the Safety and Environmental Compliance Division will coordinate with the appropriate
department to develop a mitigation plan and fill out the appropriate form for the identified hazard. The
form will be assigned a tracking number and placed on the tracking log with the corresponding hazards for
tracking purposes.

A TSS will review the current status and identify any issues with the resolution action and dates. The
portions of the safety risk register applicable to the light rail system, at a minimum, are provided monthly
to the CPUC.
All hazards identified and rated as unacceptable hazardous conditions will be separately tracked and
reported to CPUC with a determination of an unacceptable hazardous condition, along with the CAPs for
each unacceptable hazardous condition found.
The CPUC notifies the agency in writing of its acceptance or rejection of the CAP and in accordance with
procedures specified in the CPUC program standard. The CAP form requires a CPUC electronic or wet
signature approval, indicating the assigned resolution and completion of the CAP.

CAP and safety risk mitigation verification

RTD will comply with CPUC RBI procedures attached in Exhibit. RTD will provide access to CPUC with and
without advance notice. Access will be dependent on the necessary safety training and requirements to
safely access facilities, including, but not limited to, on-track safety training, use of personal protective
equipment, facility awareness, lockout tagout training, and accompaniment of an RTD employee with
appropriate communication devices.
RTD provides data to CPUC at regular intervals based on CPUC RBI procedures.
Prior to inspections, CPUC will notify the Safety and Environmental Compliance Division (CSO and assigned
TSS) and associated facility contact. Notification for inspections will be provided at least 24 hours in
advance. For inspections without advance notice, advance notice will be provided to ensure appropriate
RTD staff will be available to accompany CPUC staff. CPUC will notify the Safety and Environmental
Compliance Division and associated Transportation, Light Rail Vehicle Maintenance, Maintenance of Way,
or Capital Program department location at least one hour prior to arriving. CPUC staff will notify the proper
supervisor or staff member at the facility and participate in job briefings and job hazard analysis before
beginning the inspection.
Safety hazards identified during the inspection will be communicated to the appropriate supervisor for
resolution. Hazards that cannot receive immediate attention will be managed through the formal hazard
resolution process.

2.3.1

Risk Reduction Program Management

The purpose of the Risk Reduction Program is to improve safety performance by reducing the number and
rates of safety events, injuries, and assaults on transit workers. The Risk Reduction Program is a subset of
RTD’s overall risk management processes. Within the Operational Risk Management process, risks related
to vehicular and pedestrian safety events involving transit vehicles, assaults on transit workers, missed
safety performance target, fall within the scope of the Risk Reduction Program.
Risks and associated mitigations are identified through the Safety Committees as mentioned above in
ORM. Mitigations will consider visibility improvements such as retrofits to vehicles in revenue service and
specifications for future procurements, and deployment of assault mitigation infrastructure and technology
on transit vehicles and in transit facilities.
Once mitigations are agreed upon within the JLMSC, they will follow the agency’s asset management
planning process to plan for appropriate resource allocation. Implementation of mitigations will follow
procurement processes described in Section 3.1.5.4.

2.3.2

Safety Set-Aside

RTD must allocate specific resources (funds, personnel, equipment, etc.) dedicated to ongoing initiatives or
future projects that are reasonably likely to assist the agency in meeting the safety performance target in
the future. This allocation of 0.75% of the FTA Section 5307 Urbanized Area Formula Program (5307) funds,
independent from the 1% security fund, is required by 49 CFR 673 to ensure effective implementation and
continuous improvement of the SMS.
Projects and initiatives will be identified as a part of the Risk Management Program and Risk Reduction
Program, which is implemented in collaboration with the JLMSC. Business case for projects and initiatives
will be reviewed for likelihood to assist the agency in meeting safety performance targets and approved by
the Leadership Safety Committee. Allocation of the funds and project implementation will follow the asset
management planning and procurement processes. The projects and initiatives will be tracked and drawn
from the safety set-aside 5307 funds during the fiscal year. Unused funds will be reviewed periodically and
will be retained for ongoing initiatives or future projects that are reasonably likely to assist the agency in
meeting the safety performance targets.
The Leadership Safety Committee will receive and consider safety risk mitigations recommended by
the JLMSC. If safety risk mitigations identified within the Risk Reduction Program are not implemented,
the GM/CEO will submit and present a written statement explaining the decision to the JLMSC and BoD.
Updates on the Risk Reduction Program and performance targets will be provided in the annual updates
to the Board of Directors.
Annually, project initiatives will be evaluated to identify effectiveness in short-term impacts on Risk
Reduction Program performance targets.
The safety set-aside funding process is a critical aspect of 49 CFR 673, ensuring that rail transit agencies
allocate sufficient resources to develop, implement, and maintain a robust safety management system. By
doing so, agencies can effectively manage safety risks, comply with regulatory requirements, and promote
a culture of safety within their operations.

2.3 Risk Reduction Program

1.E.1.b

The agency operates over an eight-county district along Colorado’s Front Range area. These activities
have the potential to affect local waterways, soil, air, wildlife, vegetation, and human health. RTD’s Safety
and Environmental Compliance Division strives to exceed all state, federal, and local municipality regulatory
requirements to limit the agency’s impact to the local environment. The following management procedures
detailed below are in place to as a guide to meet this goal.

2.4.1

Management of Hazardous Materials

RTD will ensure that the hazards of chemicals used at operating divisions, buildings, stations, alignments,
facilities, and properties are evaluated and that information concerning their hazards are transmitted
to employees, contractors, first responders, customers, and any other visitor to RTD properties where
hazardous materials are stored.
RTD’s Hazard Communication (HAZCOM) plan is in place to promote chemical safety awareness at all
facilities by informing employees and visitors about risks associated with hazardous materials used or
reasonably expected to be present within agency operations.
For any hazardous chemical used or stored in the workplace, the agency must submit an annual Tier II
chemical inventory report to their State Emergency Response Commission, Local Emergency Planning
Committee, and local fire department via the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Tier II Submit
software by March 1 of each year. The information is made available to the public under the Emergency
Planning and Community Right to Know Act. Tier II Submit software is updated yearly by the EPA and
completed by the Safety and Environmental Compliance Division.
Over 2,000 listed hazardous materials and 600 extremely hazardous chemicals are subject to reporting
under EPA rule-making. Reporting requirements have been limited by quantity.
Common hazardous materials used by the agency that are subject to reporting include:
●

Diesel fuel

●

Gasoline

●

Cleaning components

●

Paint related material

●

Various aerosol cans)

●

Lead acid batteries (sulfuric acid)

These materials are inventoried upon receipt by the District Shop Warehouse and at all divisions by
local storeroom personnel. The Safety and Environmental Compliance Division maintains a chemical
inventory list within the RTD Hazard Communication Plan. Manufacture information, hazard descriptions,
and emergency response information is described in each individual product specific Safety Data Sheet
(SDS) form.
Secondary containment, oil water separators, regular inspections, stormwater best management practices,
and leak detection systems are utilized to help identify and remediate spills.

2.4 Environmental Management and
Hazardous Material Program

2.4.2

Chemical Product Approval Program

The RTD Chemical Approval Program is in place to guide RTD employees or contractors tasked with
procuring new chemical products. The purpose of this plan is to ensure all materials arriving on-site have
been inventoried and reviewed by the Safety and Environmental Compliance Division and are at an
acceptable safety and health risk level for use on RTD property. The process starts when the division or
group requesting a new product contacts the Safety and Environmental Compliance Division by email with
a copy of the SDS and a completed Product Approval Evaluation Form. If the material is acceptable for
use, the SDS will be placed into the electronic storage database for employees to view via intracompany
websites (e.g., Trapeze or the Hub). If the requested material is not approved, an alternative product that is
less harmful to human health or the environment may be suggested.
All employees and contractors directly responsible for safety as well as each employee who works with
hazardous materials receives training on proper storage/handling of chemical products, appropriate use of
personnel protection equipment, compliant disposal of unused materials, and how to locate SDSs.

2.4.3

Management of Hazardous Waste

District Shops is a small quantity generator of hazardous waste. All other facilities are categorized as very
small quantity generators of hazardous waste. Hazardous wastes can be generated by:
●

Discarding a hazardous material (e.g., oil-based paint, solvents, thinner contaminated rags)

●

Using a product (e.g., batteries, fluorescent lamps, HID lamps, electronic waste, aerosol dregs)

The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment’s (CDPHE) Hazardous Materials and Waste
Management Division directly regulates the generation of hazardous wastes at all RTD facilities under the
Colorado Code of Regulations (CCR) 6 CCR 1007-3.
Hazardous wastes are to be stored in closed containers and accumulated in satellite accumulation areas
or the Central Accumulation Storage Building at District Shops. Waste containers are labeled and located
near where the waste is generated. The Safety and Environmental Compliance Division is responsible
for properly identifying hazardous waste, labeling waste containers, performing internal inspections,
inventorying monthly generation amounts, mitigating spills, training employees, preparing off-site
shipments for disposal, record keeping, and collaborating with regulatory agencies during audits.
Personnel that add or remove hazardous waste from containers are required to receive compliance
training that is equivalent to their job duties. The effectiveness of RTD provided training is measured
through routine performance-based internal inspections. If discrepancies to CCR hazardous waste
regulations are noted during internal inspections, the Safety and Environmental Compliance personnel will
follow up with local groups to provide corrective action assistance. Corrective action follow up measures
may include discussions during safety committee meetings, suggested training opportunities, and direct
contact with local division leaders and front-line employees. Safety and Environmental Compliance
personnel that arrange hazardous waste shipments are required to receive training in EPA’s Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) site compliance and maintain Department of Transportation (DOT)
ground shipper certifications prior to receiving authorization to sign uniform hazardous waste shipping
manifests. Electronic manifests, individual site information, and notifications are stored electronically on
the EPA information system RCRAInfo. Safety and Environmental Compliance personnel have access to
the RCRAInfo database and use this tool to submit and view required compliance documentation to the
Colorado Hazardous Materials and Waste Management Division.

Underground and Aboveground Storage Tank Management

The agency is the owner of 31 regulated storage tanks throughout the district ranging from 1,000 to 48,000
gallons of diesel, gasoline, and lube oil. Storage tank systems are regulated by the Colorado Division of
Oil and Public Safety (OPS). Common components of tank systems include underground piping, secondary
containment, leak detection systems, overfill protection equipment, and automatic tank gauging. These
components are monitored daily for functionality, regulatory compliance, product inventory, and release
detection. The Safety and Environmental Compliance Division collaborates with the Capital Programs
Department and Bus Operations Division to arrange OPS required compliance testing, inspections, and
certifications for tank systems.
Spill Prevention Control and Counter Measure Plans (SPCC) that are certified by a licensed Professional
Engineer (PE) are in place at RTD facilities that store over 42,000 gallons of petroleum products in
underground storage tanks (UST).
Each of the six facilities that utilize underground storage tank systems to fuel vehicles has onsite
B-operators (Facilities Maintenance Supervisors) that oversee day-to-day operations and maintenance,
an A-operator (Manager, Facilities Maintenance Operating Facilities) that direct B-operators in their work,
and a listed facility contact (Manager, Environmental Compliance) who collects required compliance
documentation and is the liaison between the agency and OPS for audits, site characterization reporting,
and general inquiries at all six facilities. All three of these positions require OPS approved A- or B-operator
training through an approved training provider.
Safety and Environmental Compliance personnel are required to download and store compliance
documentation from the InSite360 Veeder-Root remote monitoring system at a minimum of every
30 calendar days. Abnormalities in the tank system are reported to the local B-operator and the tank
compliance contractor for resolution. Compliance reports include tank tightness testing, liquid sensor
reports, and alarm history.
Currently daily alarm history reports are received by the RTD Environmental Compliance personnel
and documentation is collected every week. Abnormalities in the tank system are reported to the local
B-operator and the tank compliance contractor for resolution.

2.4.5

Stormwater Management

To comply with the provisions of the Colorado Water Quality Control Division (WQCD), the agency has
historically held stormwater discharge permits for operating maintenance divisions, rail corridors, stations,
construction activities, and the Tunnel 16 Groundwater Treatment Facility. These permits authorize the
discharge of stormwater from these locations to the local waterways provided that the agency and its
contractors follow the requirements listed on each set of Colorado Discharge Permit System (CDPS) issued
documents. Common CDPS requirements include:
●

Illicit discharge detection and elimination procedures are in place

●

Construction site runoff controls are in place before and after project completion

●

Good housekeeping activities are continually practiced, monitored, and improved if needed

●

Internal training is conducted annually to help employees recognize and report illicit discharges

●

Proper storage and containment systems are in place for hazardous materials

●

COR070000 Non-Standard Municipal Separate Storm Sewer Systems (rail corridors/stations)

●

COG318000 Discharge from Long-term Remediation Activities (Tunnel 16 GWTP requires monthly
submissions of Discharge Monitoring Reports through EPA’s NetDMR System)

●

COR400000 Stormwater Discharges Associated with Construction Activities (East Metro
UST replacement)

2.4.6

Stationary Source Air Emission Management

Operating maintenance divisions that use boilers, paint booths, outdoor fueling stations, emergency
generators, and parts washing units that exceed CDPHE established thresholds are regulated by the
Colorado Air Pollution Control Division (APCD). The Safety and Environmental Compliance Division is
responsible for gathering fuel, natural gas, and paint consumption throughput from these sources and must
be prepared to submit inventoried data to APCD upon request. Air Pollution Emission Notifications (APENs)
must be submitted prior to operating systems that exceed APCD thresholds and renewed every five years
or before that time if significant alterations have occurred or will occur.
All sources required to obtain an operating permit, and synthetic minor sources are required to report
annual facility- wide air toxics emissions. These reports are referred to by CDPHE as Toxic Air Contaminant
(TAC) reports and are due annually on June 30th. Common RTD sources for TAC reporting include boilers,
paint booths, outdoor fueling stations, emergency generators, and parts washing units.
The Platte and East Metro bus maintenance facilities have large boilers that must be managed to follow
specific permit requirements, including:
●

Adhering to emission limitations set forth in the individual permits

●

Not allowing visible emissions to exceed 20% opacity during normal operation

●

Supplying diesel fuel to the boilers that contain less than 0.5% sulfur by weight

●

Ensuring the units are maintained in a manner to follow the manufacturer’s operating recommendations

2.4.7

Industrial Hygiene

The agency is in a continual cycle of renovation, repair, construction, and demolition of current facilities.
Safety and environmental considerations for these projects include:
●

Identification and abatement of asbestos and lead paint, and other contaminants present in
building materials that are to be disturbed

●

Proper identification, monitoring, and disposal of contaminated groundwater and soils

●

Removal of hazardous wastes that a previous facility owner may have left behind

1.E.1.b

The Safety and Environmental Compliance Division uses a third-party environmental consulting firm in
most cases to identify, mitigate, and prepare required reports for these activities. These environmental
consulting services can often be very expensive and time consuming. Identifying and addressing the need
for these environmental services at the inception of new projects is helpful in avoiding project delays, cost
increases, and non-compliance issues with regulatory agencies.
The agency’s facilities and properties may encounter industrial hygiene (IH) issues throughout their life span
that include:
●

Mold evaluations

●

Presence of air contaminants

●

Environmental site assessments

●

Site characterization reports

●

Visual emission opacity readings

Facilities throughout the District require routine IH evaluations that include:
●

Laboratory testing of 27 individual oil water separators at six different facilities

●

Preparation of monthly discharge monitoring reports (Tunnel 16 GWTF)

●

Groundwater sampling and annual reporting to OPS for the Platte Bus Maintenance Facility

2.4.8

Emergency Spill and Biological Waste Response

The agency serves an eight-county district of over 3 million people and uses a large amount of petroleum
and chemical products on a day-to-day basis. The agency frequently has a need for additional spill and
biological response assistance due to accidents, incidents, and crime.
The agency uses multiple emergency spill and biological cleanup contractors for situations that involve:
●

Chemical releases that are beyond the capabilities of staff and resources

●

Biological spill cleanup situations

●

Unforeseen situations that are beyond the scope of personnel work duties

●

Spills that reach storm water drains or local waterways

●

Mold and asbestos remediation

These contracted service providers are approved and funded through the RTD Safety and Environmental
Compliance Division. On-track safety training is provided to emergency clean-up contractors via RTD’s
learning management system.
The Safety and Environmental Compliance Division is responsible for reporting spills that exceed state and
federal established thresholds to the appropriate regulatory agency.

Management of Petroleum Contaminated Debris

Due to the large amount of petroleum contaminated rags, wipes, pads, and absorbents that the agency
historically generates at local maintenance facilities, it has been a long-standing best management
practice to separate most of this material from normally occurring trash throughout the facilities. Operating
facilities are equipped with specialized containers (mini-boxes) that are lined with thick cubic-yard-size
polyurethane tote bags that are manifested, sealed, and picked out of the mini-boxes by boom trucks and
taken separately offsite to avoid comingling with normal outgoing refuse. The contents of the mini-boxes
are profiled through a vendor-supplied customer database that also stores shipment details. The debris is
verified to be non-RCRA hazardous waste through periodic sampling and analytical lab reporting through
which the RTD Safety and Environmental Compliance Division has vetted. Pickup requests are called in by
local Storeroom Supervisors or RTD Safety and Environmental Compliance personnel.

ASSURANCE

The third element of the PTASP is Safety Assurance, which describes how the agency will monitor,
measure, and review its processes to ensure it remains in compliance with established standards.
These processes, safety performance targets, and reports provide assurance to leadership that the
organization and system are functioning at an acceptable level of safety. The reviews, inspections, rules
checks, and compliance verification procedures are described, required schedules set, and acceptable
measures established.

3.1 Internal Safety Review Process
Internal safety reviews (ISR) and inspections are critical components of an integrated system safety
program. As such, ISRs are conducted semiannually to ensure compliance with the SMS and that the plan
is effectively implemented. Facilities are inspected monthly for occupational safety issues and local fire
codes. Written reports of each review are prepared and distributed once the ISR is completed. Senior
leaders will discuss safety reviews, evaluate the effectiveness of the SMS, recommend corrective action if
necessary, and ensure timely implementation and follow up. An internal light rail review report is compiled
each year in January and submitted to the CPUC by Feb. 15. The report documents the review findings
for the year, including the results of internal reviews performed during the previous year; a summary of
required corrective actions taken, if any; and provision for follow-up to ensure timely implementation and
to determine effectiveness of the SMS. The annual audit report will be accompanied by a formal letter of
certification signed by the GM/CEO indicating that the agency is in compliance with its SMS. If areas of
deficiency are identified, the GM/CEO will identify the activities the agency will take to achieve compliance.
Documentation of inspection and reviews are maintained.
As part of the ISR program, all departments are subject to review. The CSO is responsible for and has
complete authority to conduct ISRs. Two reviews are conducted annually, one in the summer and one in
the winter. Within a three-year period, all PTASP elements are reviewed for compliance with the plan and
CPUC requirements. The sixth review cycle, which is in the last quarter of the third year, is reserved to
review and revise the audit process to ensure that all elements are completed and that the program meets
CPUC requirements.
The agency will notify the CPUC of an upcoming review cycle at least 30 days prior to the start of the
safety review.
An opening conference may be scheduled with the departments subject to safety review. At the opening
conference, checklists are distributed, discussed, and reviewed for accuracy, and a schedule is set.
The actual ISR consists of interviews with key personnel, documentation review and observation of
activities to assess compliance and understanding of rules, training and procedures. After completion
of the onsite activities, the checklists are completed, and a written draft report is developed. The draft
report may include recommendations or findings. Recommendations are defined as suggestions to
make improvements, while findings are defined as documented non-compliances in the implementation
of established programs, rules or procedures. The draft report is distributed for review and comment to
the affected parties. A final report is completed and distributed to all parties. Recorded findings require
the development of a CAP. The annual ISR report prepared and submitted to the CPUC will include an
evaluation of the adequacy and effectiveness of the SMS.
Recommendations from previous review cycles will be reviewed and evaluated in subsequent cycles.
Findings will be tracked under the CAP process of placing all findings on a tracking spreadsheet and the
subsequent quarterly corrective action plan progress reports will be filed with the CPUC.

Field Inspections/Co-op Walks

The Safety and Environmental Compliance Division conducts periodic field inspections/co-op walkthroughs. Maintenance facilities are inspected monthly to ensure compliance with occupational safety
regulations and common fire safety practices. Any deviations from required activities or identified safety
hazards are resolved through a formal reporting process.

3.1.2

Safety Event Investigation, Notiﬁcation, Reporting, and
Corrective Action Plans

Formal investigations shall be conducted for reportable safety events. Safety events are investigated
according to the Event Notification, Reporting and Investigation Policy and Procedure.
All reportable safety events, as defined in 4 CCR 723 will be tracked and evaluated by the CSO and the
affected chief/DCOO. The Safety and Environmental Compliance Division will oversee event investigation
activities with the CPUC and will provide as much advance notice as practicable to notify the CPUC of a
safety event investigation. When investigating a safety event as defined in 7347, the agency will give prior
sufficient telephone or email notice to CPUC staff of the times that a safety event investigation team will
convene to conduct interviews, inspections, examinations, or tests to determine the cause of the accident.
Light rail control will notify the Safety and Environmental Compliance Division of every accident that meets
the criteria listed below. Light rail accidents are investigated according to SOP 103.2–Incident/Accident
Investigation and the Policy and Procedure for Event Notification, Reporting, and Investigation.
Notification is required within two hours pursuant to 7348(a) and (b) for any safety event occurring on a
Rail Fixed Guideway Public Transportation System where one or more of the following occurs:
●

Fatality at the scene, or confirmation of death within 30 days of safety event. Fatalities include
suicides, but do not include deaths in or on RTD property that are a result of drug overdose,
exposure to the elements, illness, or natural causes.

●

Two or more injuries as defined in 7341(x), requiring immediate medical attention away from
the scene

●

An evacuation for life safety reasons when persons depart from transit vehicles or facilities for life
safety reasons, including self-evacuation and other situations defined in 7341(p). An evacuation of
passengers into the rail right of way (not at a platform or station) for any reason is presumed to be
an evacuation for life safety reasons

●

Unintended train movement, defined in 7341(vvv) as any instance where a revenue vehicle is
moving and is not under the control of a driver (whether or not the operator is physically on the
vehicle at the time). This applies regardless of whether the event occurred in revenue service

●

Collect, Analyze, and Report Safety Management System Data,
and Maintain Records

SMS data is collected through a variety of sources including near miss information, safety event
investigation reports, ISRs, safety committee meetings, occupational injury reports, incident reports,
use of an accident matrix, system monitoring including testing and inspection records and the hazard
management program. This safety data will be analyzed and used for development of key safety
performance indicators and targets. The agency reports the following to NTD:
●

Fatalities – total number of reportable fatalities and rate per total vehicle revenue miles by mode

●

Injuries – total number of reportable injuries and rate per total vehicle revenue miles by mode

●

Major events – total number of reportable events and rate per total vehicle revenue miles by mode

●

System reliability – mean distance between major mechanical failures by mode

These safety performance measures are used to select improvement targets for these four measures
and for light rail, bus and paratransit to encourage improvements and monitor the safety performance of
delivering transit services. In addition, the agency selects additional performance measures and targets,
both leading and lagging, to ensure continual improvement of the SMS. The agency communicates safety
performance information internally using various methods of communication, including electronic message
boards, committee meetings, newsletters, and team/crew meetings to keep employees informed of SMS
initiatives, risks and performance.
The agency will make its safety performance measures improvement and targets available to applicable
state agencies (e.g., the Colorado Department of Transportation) and metropolitan planning organizations
(currently Denver Regional Council of Governments). To the maximum extent practicable, the agency will
coordinate with the external entities in the selection of external entity safety performance targets.
The safety data collected will be analyzed for potential safety impacts. Identified areas of concern are
reported to appropriate personnel in the form of specific project reports and memos. Records of system
safety data are maintained in the office of the Safety and Environmental Compliance Division for a minimum
of three years. Certain information, such as safety certification backup documentation, is maintained by the
document control process managed by the Capital Programs Department. In addition to safety, the Safety
and Environmental Compliance Division maintains data and documentation of activities required by the SMS.

3.1.4

System Modiﬁcations or Major Repairs

New facility equipment modifications and retrofits are reviewed and approved by the RTD engineering
group and the technical support staff. Review may also take place by the RTD Infrastructure Change
Review Committee. Non-infrastructure changes will follow the non-infrastructure change process.

3.1.5

New Equipment, System Expansion, and Modiﬁcations Hazard Resolution

New equipment, system expansions, and modifications are included in the risk management program
process as described in section 2. This process is facilitated by the Safety and Environmental Compliance
Division and performed jointly by the Capital Programs, Bus Operations, Rail Operations, and Safety
and Environmental Compliance divisions. New equipment, system expansions, and modifications are
ultimately reviewed, approved, and documented.

New Equipment, System Expansion, and Modiﬁcation Review

New equipment, system expansions, and modifications are reviewed and approved by the Capital
Programs Department and Bus Operations, Rail Operations, and Safety and Environmental Compliance
divisions. This review is conducted to ensure that new equipment, expansions, and modifications safely
and operationally integrate into the existing system.

3.1.5.2 New Equipment, System Expansion, and Modiﬁcation Acceptance
Operational readiness of new equipment and system expansions is verified through the equipment
acceptance and safety and security certification process. The Bus Operations and Rail Operations divisions
perform rigorous equipment and integration testing as part of the vehicle and equipment acceptance
process. Once complete, new vehicles and equipment are formally accepted by the Bus Operations
and Rail Operations divisions. This information is presented and approved by the Safety and Security
Certification Program and described in section 3. The Safety and Security Certification Program provides
an identification, design, review, and verification process for system expansions and modifications.
Certification process completion is verified by sign-off from the Safety and Environmental
Compliance Division.

3.1.5.3 Exceptions to Established Design Criteria
The agency has a process to request variances to design criteria. All variances go through three levels
of review. Level 4 and above exceptions to design criteria are approved only by the acceptance of the
CSO and the GM/CEO. If appropriate, the design criteria may be amended or modified to accommodate
acceptable modifications. Capital Programs is responsible for the maintenance and distribution of the
design criteria. The design criteria will be reviewed prior to new corridor construction.

3.1.5.4 Procurement Procedures
Procurement of equipment and materials is controlled by the Procurement Standards Manual. Each
procurement requires the development of detailed specifications assembled by the requesting manager.
Levels of review are built into the procurement process depending upon the scope of the procurement.
As the scope of the procurement increases, so does the level of review. Minor procurements require
authorization from the Contracting and Procurement Division and the division manager of the requesting
division. Major procurements, such as light rail- or bus construction-related projects or procurement of
buses or light rail vehicles (LRVs), are subject to the following review process.
The Operations Department and technical support staff develop detailed specifications through the
design process. These specifications are subject to several internal reviews at varying levels of design and
personnel from other transit agencies, where relevant. In addition to procurement specifications, the safety
and security certification review process described in Section 3 governs construction.

Management of Change (MOC) consists of multiple streams of change that will consist of change
identification, risk assessment and impact analysis, review and approval, implementation, and training
and communication.
The overall MOC process is managed by the Safety and Environmental Compliance Division in
collaboration with associated responsible parties for various streams of change. Changes will be reviewed
and approved by a committee of relevant stakeholders who will evaluate potential impacts and provide
approval to proceed if risk level is acceptable.
MOC per Federal Requirements is currently beginning to be integrated into procedures. Infrastructure
changes will be managed through the Infrastructure Change Review (ICR) process, which is managed
by the Capital Programs Department. The ICR process coordinates physical changes before they are
implemented in the existing operating environment. Formal Project Management Plans are prepared for
large projects.
Representatives from each involved department and personnel from the Safety and Environmental
Compliance Division are represented in the ICR and MOC processes. When changes are made to existing
structures or facilities, it is critical that affected personnel, the public or other groups be notified of changes
that might have potential safety or security impacts. Affected personnel are invited to participate in project
meetings and coordinate any changes. Additional training may be required. Operations and maintenance
procedures, bulletins or SOPs may need to be developed. Engagement and Communications Department
personnel assist with communications to outside agencies or affected groups. An essential element of
communications must take place after the project is completed. Any observed negative or hazardous
impacts of physical changes must be reported to the chief engineer or CSO, as soon as possible, so that
hazards may be assessed and included in the hazard resolution process.
MOC process also applies to existing bus and light rail services systems, vehicles, facilities, and equipment
that may not require formal safety certification, but may have safety impacts.

3.2.1

Safety and Security Certiﬁcation

Safety and security certification programs will follow Safety and Security Certification Policy and associated
Framework to ensure that safety and security concerns and hazards are addressed prior to the initiation
of light rail and bus operations for new corridors, system extensions, rehabilitation, or modification or
replacement of equipment where new risks are introduced. The agency uses the FTA Handbook for Transit
Safety and Security Certification to develop the requirements for each safety and security certification
program. An individual safety and security certification plan is developed for each new corridor. Certain
projects might have a scaled certification proportional to potential risks introduced. For modifications or
rehabilitations, safety and security certification is addressed through the preparation of safety and security
certification forms applicable to the scope of work. If equipment is procured as part of a new maintenance
facility. LRVs undergo a formalized commissioning acceptance process owned by the manufacturer under
the supervision of Light Rail Operations.

3.2 Management of Change

The safety and security certification program has the following goals:
●

Verify that acceptable safety and security levels are met or exceeded through various phases of
the project’s lifecycle

●

Document the verification of safety and security standards

●

Provide consistency for project certification

The CSO and the manager of Safety Assurance and Certification are responsible for the management of
the program.

3.2.2

Quality Assurance

Capital projects have a quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) function built into the design and
construction of the project. Specific personnel are responsible for QA/QC activities. In general, QA/QC
activities in large projects follow standard industry practice and are subject to review by the FTA and
others. Quality control during construction projects is a requirement of the contractor and submitted in the
quality plan prior to initiation of construction. The agency retains qualified inspectors and testing firms to
provide quality assurance by document submittal reviews and periodic testing of materials throughout
the project.
Received goods are required to be compared to items ordered, lot numbering, or other certifications
as required on safety critical items. Where applicable, receiving personnel ensure that lot number
documentation is provided before materials are received or accepted. Periodically, purchasing personnel
or TSSs will randomly sample hardware, slings, lifting devices, and other devices for compliance with
specifications. Items will also be functionally tested periodically to ensure they meet standards.

3.3.1

Reports and Data Analysis

The results of various operational tests, including periodic efficiency checks, are compiled, and reviewed
at least quarterly by the general superintendent of Light Rail Transportation, or designated manager. A
written form of the review will be retained by Light Rail Operations and available upon request of the Safety
and Environmental Compliance Division and during ISRs. An annual report summarizing the previous
year’s results of the operational tests, including a trend analysis of the available data, is retained by Light
Rail Operations and provided during ISRs and on request from the Safety and Environmental Compliance
Division for further review and trend analysis.

3.3.1.1

Enforcement Violations

Rule violations are addressed through the agency’s management process, which includes coaching,
retraining, and formal discipline that may result in termination. Additionally, all accidents and incidents
are reviewed by supervisors and the Safety Division to determine if rules have been violated. RTD will
determine if revisions, changes, or additions are necessary to the rules and SOPs.

3.3.1.2 Risk Management
A TSS may incorporate violation trends or deficiencies for any rule or procedure into the risk management
program for resolution. Risks unresolved by the Rail Safety Committee (RSC) or the Bus Safety Committee
(BSC) are escalated based on the ORM Framework for further tracking, review, resolution, and/or
correction. Noncompliant review findings determined to be hazardous are documented in the safety
risk register. A date of observation, description of the hazardous condition, corrective action required,
and implementation date are tracked until the hazardous condition is corrected. (See section 2 for
further information.) The Safety and Environmental Compliance Division conducts ongoing and regular
observations and reviews to determine the effectiveness of the rule compliance program.

3.3.2

SMS Policies, Procedures, and Processes

The agency has adopted policies, procedures, processes, training materials and employee rule books to
establish requirements and expectations for safe operations, maintenance and construction for the agency.
These are reviewed periodically and updated as necessary according to the following guidelines: prior
to revenue service of a system expansion, new bus route, or new corridor; or as recommended by the
ISR process. A committee consisting of controller/supervisors, operators, and TSSs performs the review.
Recommended SOP changes are reviewed and approved by the chief/DCOO of the affected
department/division.

Techniques, Schedules, and Procedures

Preventative maintenance (PM) inspection schedules can be generated through the enterprise asset
management system per equipment manufacturer guidelines and recommendations, and as required
by local, state and federal regulations. A Maintenance Supervisor identifies upcoming PM inspections
and assigns the work to their crew for completion. Inspectors use checklists to identify potential physical
hazards, unsafe equipment, unsafe acts and policy and procedural deficiencies with the facility or
equipment being inspected. Completed inspection reports and checklists are returned to the supervisor
for review. Each department is responsible for maintaining inspection and repair records to confirm the
inspection process.

3.4.2.1 MOW (Line, Signal, and Rail Maintenance) Standards and Procedures
Line and signal technicians use a Maintenance of Way plan, which includes track safety standards,
electrical standards, SOPs and internal work instructions that outline specific testing and maintenance
procedures modeled after Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) regulations. These are in accordance with
49 CFR Parts 233-236.
Right-of-way rail maintenance uses a maintenance plan, RTD Maintenance of Way Track Safety Standards,
to maintain the track modeled to be in accordance with FRA regulations 49 CFR Part 213. The standard
outlines all aspects of proper maintenance and inspections regarding track.

Maintenance

Maintenance and service of all vehicles, equipment, and facilities is established using manufacturer
manuals, codes, standards, and established procedures as guidelines. Maintenance is performed at a level
of readiness that ensures safe, efficient, and reliable service. The agency maintains data to track scheduled
maintenance of vehicles and equipment.
It is the employee’s responsibility to conduct pre-departure inspection of the vehicles. Safety critical
equipment that does not meet established requirements is withdrawn from service. Vehicles or equipment
involved in an accident are removed from service if there is reason to suspect that equipment failure
contributed to the cause of the accident. Vehicles or equipment are returned to service only after they are
determined that no defects could have contributed to the accident and if the equipment is deemed safe
for service. The agency has established procedures to ensure rapid deployment, recovery, and return to
service in the event of an emergency.
Effective maintenance is an indispensable prerequisite to safe and efficient operations. The Bus and Light
Rail divisions have standards that make safety and reliability the primary objectives of the system. These
goals are met through the incorporation of preventive and repair maintenance programs for all aspects of
the system. The LRV Maintenance Plan addresses incorporates the following principles:
●

Preventive maintenance programs will be cost-effective in minimizing service failures

●

Changes in preventive maintenance programs may be expected periodically as experience is
gained on the equipment maintained

●

Preventive maintenance goals and policies will not be altered due to time constraints or as a costreduction measure in times of financial stress

●

Effective maintenance procedures require much record-keeping and information storage/retrieval

●

The technical sophistication of the LRV, and the tracking of a large, expensive inventory, place a
heavy responsibility on the information capabilities of the light rail vehicle maintenance group

The Bus Fleet Maintenance Plan addresses the following areas:
●

Maintenance division goals and objectives

●

Contingency bus fleet

●

Maintenance management system

●

Preventative maintenance program

●

Wheelchair lift preventative maintenance program

●

Quality control program

●

New bus inspection procedure

●

Maintenance bulletins

●

SOPs

The agency conducts internal and contracted maintenance activities so that the system is safely and
efficiently maintained. The maintenance practices also use existing transit operations, and in many
instances, will share organizational services, personnel, and equipment.

Drug and Alcohol Program

The agency maintains an employee drug and alcohol program in compliance with DOT and FTA
regulations. The program includes criteria for random testing of safety sensitive personnel and testing for
cause, either accident related or from observed behavior. The Human Resources Department manages this
program, which is subject to frequent review by the FTA.
Drug and alcohol testing and information about drug and alcohol abuse is included in the Drug and
Alcohol Policy. Training on this policy is required for each new hire and provided during orientation
and through a self-guided educational video. The program is administered by the Manager of HR DOT
Compliance who verifies compliance with the program and oversees training. Revisions to the program are
distributed to all employees.
GENERAL POLICY STATEMENT
The agency is dedicated being a trusted leader in mobility, delivering excellence and value to its
community and customers and to providing a healthy, safe, and satisfying work environment for
employees. The agency and the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1001 agree that employees must be
able to work in a drug- and alcohol-free work environment. At the same time, every effort must be made to
protect the privacy rights of all employees. The employer has the right and duty to protect its employees,
customers, and the public from the adverse effects of drug abuse and alcohol misuse. It is not the intent of
the employer to restrict employees’ on-the-job conduct.
A successful drug and alcohol program must address the safety implications of drug abuse and alcohol
misuse and must also institute proper procedures and controls guaranteeing accurate alcohol and drug
testing results, while preserving confidentiality and focusing on rehabilitation through an effective
employee assistance program.
It is the responsibility of all employees to report to work not under the influence of alcohol or controlled
substances. At the same time, every effort must be made to protect and respect employees’ rights and privacy.
To meet these goals and comply with legal requirements, the agency has implemented this policy to:
●

Detect drug or alcohol use in violation of this policy through testing

●

Encourage employees to obtain treatment and rehabilitation for drug and alcohol problems

●

Deter drug or alcohol use in violation of this policy through random testing, education, training,
and discipline

●

Enforce the goal of a drug- and alcohol-free work environment through appropriate discipline

Drug and alcohol abuse can have profound effects on the health, work, and personal life not only of
the abuser, but also the abuser’s family, friends, and the public at large. Employees should be aware of
the signs and symptoms of drug or alcohol problems, and of available methods of intervening when a
substance abuse problem is suspected.
Many elements of this policy are required by federal regulations covering persons in safety-sensitive
job classifications.
Employees wishing to review federal regulations on drug and alcohol use may contact the Manager of
DOT Compliance.

3.6 Drug and Alcohol Program

To the extent that any elements of this policy may conflict with federal or state regulations as they may
be amended or revised in the future, the regulations shall take precedence. Employees are expected
to review, be familiar with, and obey this policy and all laws concerning drug and alcohol use and
testing. All existing and new employees must receive at least 60 minutes of training on the effects and
consequences of prohibited drug use on personal health, safety, and the work environment and the signs
and symptoms that may indicate prohibited drug use.
Compliance with this policy, including participation in the drug and alcohol testing program, is a required
condition of employment.

3.6.2

Applicability

3.6.2.1 Categories of Employees
This policy applies to all safety-sensitive and non-safety-sensitive employees, volunteers and contractors
and are referred to in this policy as “employees” unless otherwise noted. This policy applies to all
employees while on agency property to perform their duties or while performing any work-related
business. Visitors and vendors are expected to adhere to this policy while on agency property.
In addition to being subject to all other elements of this policy, employees who perform “safety sensitive
functions,” for RTD, as that term is defined in federal regulations 49 CFR Part 40 as amended and Part
655, are subject to random drug and alcohol testing and other specific requirements set forth in this
policy. Generally, a safety-sensitive function occurs when an employee is performing, ready to perform, or
immediately available to perform any duty related to the safe operation of public transportation.
The following are safety-sensitive functions:
●

Operation of a revenue service vehicle, whether or not such vehicle is in revenue service

●

Controlling dispatch or movement of a revenue service vehicle

●

Maintaining revenue service vehicles or equipment used in revenue service

●

Operating a non-revenue-service vehicle when required to be operated by a holder of a
Commercial Driver’s License

●

Carrying a firearm for security purposes

The agency reviews the actual duties performed by employees in all job classifications to determine
which employees perform safety-sensitive functions and determines which job functions may require
the performance of safety-sensitive duties. An analysis will be performed if any new job classifications
are developed, or current job description changes, to determine if the job should be considered safetysensitive by querying the policy.

1.E.1.b

The fourth element of the PTASP is Safety Promotion. This section describes the responsibilities of
employees related to the safety program and encouragement of others to follow established policies. It
describes the committee structure established to form the means of discussing, solving, and, if necessary,
elevating safety issues and concerns to resolution. Training and certifications to enhance the qualifications
and competencies of employees are described along with the reoccurring activities designed to promote
and remind all employees about safety in the agency.
Safety performance is communicated at multiple levels of the agency to ensure the right information
reaches the right people. Regular updates are provided to the Leadership Safety Committee to inform
decision-making and track progress on agency-wide safety objectives. Division-level safety committees
review localized data and discuss targeted actions for their areas of responsibility. Crew meetings provide
an opportunity to share relevant safety trends, reinforce key messages, and gather feedback directly from
frontline employees. This multi-level approach keeps leadership, supervisors, and employees aligned on
priorities, risks, and improvement efforts.

4.1 SMS Implementation Activities
4.1.1

SMS Implementation

The agency implements the SMS through the active involvement of executive leadership, line
management, and frontline transit workers. This collaborative approach ensures that all elements of the
SMS are effectively integrated into daily operations and maintenance activities. Leadership is responsible
for establishing safety policies, coordinating with JLMSC to set Safety Risk Reduction Program performance
targets, and providing resources, while line management oversees the execution of these policies and
ensures compliance. This collaborative effort is aimed at achieving the desired safety outcomes, such as
reducing incidents, enhancing overall safety performance and safety culture.

4.1.2

Committees and Working Groups

The agency supports SMS implementation through established committees and working groups. These
committees and working groups are coordinated by leadership and line management and focus on specific
areas such as bus and light rail operations and maintenance services. These committees and working
groups help maintain a continuous improvement cycle within the SMS framework to foster a proactive
safety culture across the agency.

4.1.2.1

Joint Labor - Management Safety Committee

The purpose of the Joint-Labor Management Safety Committee is to reduce safety risks; to reduce the
number and rate of accidents, injuries, and assaults on transit workers at RTD and its contractors (the
System); and for the oversight of the safe operation of the System within the communities it serves.
Responsibilities for the JLMSC are described in Section 1.3.3.

The JLMSC will each unilaterally select five representatives with two Committee Co-Chairs, one chosen by
ATU and one chosen by RTD.
The JLMSC will meet a minimum of six times annually or more frequently at the discretion of the
Committee. The Committee shall determine the date, time, and location of the next Committee meeting at
each meeting.
ATU shall be reimbursed by RTD for reasonable expenses it incurs directly related to the Committee.
RTD will pay each ATU Committee member their regular wage rate for time required to travel to and from
the meetings and to attend Committee meetings, time reasonably necessary to prepare for Committee
meetings, and time reasonably necessary to perform other Committee functions.
At the Committee’s direction, Co-Chairs may invite subject matter experts or individuals with relevant
knowledge on matters before the committee.
Committee members will use a collaborative approach in discussing and making decisions in any matters
requiring a decision by the Committee. If the Committee members are unable to reach a consensus
decision, the Committee may refer the matter for non-binding mediation with a mediator from the Federal
Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) to assist the members in reach agreement.

4.1.2.2 Management of Change/Infrastructure Change Review
(MOC/ICR) Committee
MOC control within the agency will be managed through the ICR process for physical infrastructure
changes during design, construction, or modification. The ICR process is managed for the agency by the
Capital Programs Department. The MOC process is managed by the Chief Engineer and the CSO. MOC
management consists of the ICR process during design and construction, and the Non-Infrastructure MOC
process during operations. The Non-Infrastructure MOC process is managed by the CSO.

4.1.2.3 Bus Safety Committee (BSC) and Rail Safety Committee (RSC)
The BSC and RSC coordinate ongoing safety efforts within the transportation, facilities, and maintenance
functions of the Bus Operations Division and Light Rail Division. The committee meets monthly to update
and mitigate hazards within their facilities and on their systems.
BSCs are formed for the Transportation and Maintenance groups within District Shops, Platte, East Metro,
and Boulder divisions. The BSCs and RSC are facilitated by the Safety and Environmental Compliance
Division’s delegate, usually a TSS. The committees consist of up to any manager within the division,
and one or more employees from the following areas, which may include, but are not limited to: Street
Operations, Bus Operations, Bus Maintenance, Facilities Maintenance, Health and Wellness, Transit
Security, Treasury, etc.

The ATU 1001 appoints bargaining unit employees to the BSC and RSC as needed to serve as safety
representatives from the ranks of each department.
Committee members are granted an opportunity to speak, and to present safety issues to the BSC or RSC,
through an open communication process.
Most safety issues are resolved within the parameters of the BSC and RSC. Issues not resolved in the BSC
or RSC, or safety critical hazards, will be elevated to the next higher-level safety committee, such as the
Joint Labor-Management Safety Committee, or ultimately to the Leadership Safety Committee.
Safety Committee actions include the following:
●

Review employee reported hazards and issues brought forward to the committee

●

Review safety risk register

4.2.1

Employee Safety Training, Certiﬁcation, Veriﬁcation, and Performance Testing

Employees receive formal training and certification for the work they perform according to their job
classification. The categories of safety-related work requiring training and certification are Rail and
Bus Operators and Maintainers. The specific programs are discussed below. However, each training
and certification program contains classroom and hands-on training and written exams. Certification
documentation, including tests and test scores, is maintained in employee files and is subject to review
during the internal safety review program.
Except for the on-track safety training program required of contractors working on or near RTD rail
property, the agency does not train or certify contractors or employees of contractors. The on-track safety
training program is required of contractors prior to issuance of an access permit to work near or on RTD
rail property. The program is usually instructed in a train-the-trainer format allowing contractors to train
their own personnel. Compliance with this program is verified through in-field observation and examination
of contractor training cards. The Safety and Environmental Compliance Division maintains a log of all
contractors trained under the program.
Regarding performance testing (to include operational tests and efficiency checks), any operating or
maintenance rule is subject to verification and compliance. Compliance with rules, training, and certification
requirements is verified in several ways. Rail and bus operators are frequently observed in the field
by supervisors and Safety and Environmental Compliance Division personnel; however, a supervisor
must discuss an observed rule violation with the operator as soon as practicable. In addition to ongoing
monitoring and observation, rail and bus operators are subject to formal ride checks in which supervisors,
usually anonymously or covertly, observe operators according to predetermined criteria or a checklist.
These ride checks are documented, reviewed with the operator, and maintained in the operator’s
employee file. These records are subject to verification during the ISR process. Any trend or issue
discovered during system monitoring, observation, and ride checks is reported to divisional leadership and
the CSO for inclusion in the operational risk management risk register.
Bus, rail, and facility maintainers also receive direct supervision, including observation and verification of
their maintenance activities. Each piece of work that is assigned to a maintainer is reviewed and approved
for correctness by an immediate supervisor through the work order process. When a Maintainer completes
a work assignment, the direct supervisor verifies and approves the work through observation and signature
approval on the work order. The maintainer will enter in the enterprise asset management system that the
work is complete, and the direct supervisor will verify and approve the work, then accept that the work
was properly completed in the enterprise system. Maintenance activities are also observed during the ISR
process. Supervision is assessed during the ISR program by the review of documentation and compliance
with schedules. If issues are discovered, they are reported as recommendations or findings in the review
report. Review findings are referred for inclusion in the hazard management program.

4.2.2

Light Rail Operator Certiﬁcation

Light rail operators must complete a 12-week training program, which includes written tests and practical
examinations. Training consists of nine weeks of classroom and three weeks of on-the-job revenue
service training before entering revenue service. Competency standards are established in the “Regional
Transportation District Light Rail Training Quality Manual” (see Exhibit). Prior to entering service, operators
must pass a final ride check practical examination with a minimum of a fair score and must score 100% on
the Hands Bells Signals test with a cumulative final examination score of 80%.

Employees and contractor personnel, whether construction or service contractors, are required to follow
with applicable rules and SOPs as well as local, state, and federal safety regulations. Contractors are
required to comply with specific safety or environmental laws that apply to their work.
The project manager consults with the appropriate subject matter experts in the Safety Environmental
Compliance, Legal Services, and Contracting and Procurement Divisions to ensure that all applicable safety
and training requirements are included in the contract.

4.3.3

Work-Required Training for Employees and Contractors

The Safety and Environmental Compliance Division develops safety policies and procedures for
occupational safety modeled on OSHA guidelines. Regular training sessions are conducted with affected
employees based on job hazard analysis. Annual refresher training is conducted for high-risk tasks
and activities.
All employees and contractor personnel who foul or have the potential to foul the tracks (within 10 feet
of centerline of track) must receive OTST prior to beginning their work. Contractors are responsible
for ensuring that their employees complete OSHA-required training prior to performing projects. The
Roadway Worker Protection (RWP) Manual provides detailed program and training requirements for all
roadway workers.

4.3.4

Contractor Safety Coordination and Construction Safety

All contractor work on or near agency light rail property is controlled by access permits. Prior to issuing an
access permit, the contractor is required to meet with staff from Capital Engineering and Rail Operations
to describe and coordinate their work. After this initial coordination, the contractor applies for a permit,
which is reviewed and approved by Light Rail Maintenance of Way, Rail Transportation, and Safety and
Environmental Compliance prior issuance by Light Rail Maintenance of Way. The contractor is bound
to the requirements of the permit. All contractors working with the agency are also bound by contract
specifications for the work they are to perform.
Key documents guiding the management of construction safety are the Construction Safety Guidelines,
and the Safety and Security Certification Policy and Framework. The Construction Safety Guidelines
presents the requirements for construction projects and follows OSHA construction requirements and
regulations. Contractors are required to follow OSHA construction safety requirements and requirements of
contract specifications and access permits.
The Safety and Environmental Compliance Division conducts periodic construction site visits to monitor
contractor workplace safety and conformance to OSHA standards. Visits include contractor safety
orientation prior to project commencement, field monitoring, and site safety inspections. Periodic safety
meetings are conducted between the agency and contractors to ensure safe project construction.

Introduction
Implementing the Operational Risk Management (ORM) framework will improve how Denver Regional
Transportation District (RTD) manages risk and represents a shared commitment to an effective
process through a formal, continuous, top-down, data-driven, organizational-wide approach to
manage risk, assure effectiveness of risk controls, and promote ORM in the agency. The ORM process
applies to all risks for the agency, except financial and legal risks, which are covered by the internal
audit function. This framework outlines the tasks for implementing a formal, documented process for
ORM throughout the agency.
This effort demonstrates RTD’s commitment to improving the maturity of its approach to ORM, which
will unify the agency’s management systems and other activities to achieve agency objectives
effectively and efficiently.
Element II of the RTD Transit Agency Safety Plan (TASP) is Risk Management, which describes how
RTD identifies, evaluates, tracks, and mitigates risks and risk in the organization and on the transit
system. The risk management element and the processes undertaken by the agency are identified
and described in sufficient detail to be effectively undertaken throughout RTD. The acceptable risk
level and performance targets are established and documented.
Similar to a Plan – Do – Check – Act (PDCA) process, ORM is designed to be a continual effort to proactively identify and mitigate risk and to improve the data-driven, decisionmaking process within the agency. The management of identified risks is a
vital component of the RTD Operational Management System.
Risk is “the effect of uncertainty on objectives” internal or external to the
RTD system. An unacceptable risk is a condition that may endanger or
seriously harm human life, significantly destruct property or result in system
loss. This includes harm to customers, employees, contractors, equipment,
and to the general public. These risk conditions must be mitigated or
eliminated. Risks may be observed in the operating environment, through
procedures, during system modifications, while undertaking capital projects,
from investigations and audits, or operational changes.
The ORM Framework applies to all RTD employees and obligates everyone to constantly observe risks
in their work areas and report them to their safety committee, through a reporting process or to their
supervisor.
Decisions on risk should be informed to pursue the strategic priorities in the 2021-2026 Strategic
Plan:

Principles/Goals
An integrated ORM Framework applies to the entire organization and demonstrates the inclusion of
risk in decision-making as defined in the Operational Risk Framework.
RTD employees understand risk as “the effect of uncertainty on objectives” and incorporate a
probabilistic approach in decision-making.
The Leadership Team (LT) commits to develop, implement, and utilize a uniform, evidence based,
ORM process that will effectively and efficiently achieve a common purpose, mission, and framework.
The LT is committed to:
x
x
x
x
x

Understanding risk in the context of the probability (likelihood) and severity (consequence) of
events that can or do happen
Using ORM to guide agency actions that support delivery of the agency’s objectives within
fiscal, ethical, regulatory, and other practical constraints
Being transparent about the potential tradeoffs between risk, cost, and performance inherent
in all decisions
Using clearly defined agency strategies, objectives, operational plans, and processes in the
identification, evaluation, mitigation, and acceptance of risk
Making best use of RTD’s limited resources to meet its objectives

Any exceptions to this commitment must be documented as out of compliance and signed by the
General Manager and CEO with copies to the Chief Safety Officer. A copy of the ORM policy is
provided in Appendix A.
The continuous identification, monitoring, and mitigation of risk is key to an effective ORM. The RTD
ORM will be an ongoing process with the continual improvement goals of:
x
x
x

Increasing staff understanding of the process
Increasing use of ORM to make data-driven decisions
Improving quality and consistency of risk evaluation across the agency

x
x

Directly reporting to their supervisor, safety committee or union representative
Submitting directly on the Hub, which is the agency’s intranet (click on blue safety person

2. Evaluate Risk
Risk evaluation attempts to define what the risk means to employees, customers and/or the system.
The primary purpose of the risk evaluation process is to determine the elements of and reasons for
the risk with the purpose of eliminating or controlling it. The factors contributing to the risk should
be fully understood and evaluated by the employees or safety committees. Training will be required.
This understanding and evaluation will assist in determining the potential controls to put in place and
the effectiveness of the mitigation efforts.
As part of evaluating accidents and incidents, root cause analysis using the “Five Whys?”
methodology can be used to understand root causes and determine the most effective solutions to
mitigating risks.
Part of the evaluation of risk is to determine potential controls to mitigate the risk. There are five
basic steps to mitigating risk:
x
x
x
x
x

Design for minimum risk
Incorporate control devices
Provide warning devices
Develop procedures and training
Acceptance of residual/remaining risk

Packet Pg. 180

Potential controls, in order of effectiveness, are:
x
x
x
x
x

Elimination – remove the hazard
Substitution – replace of material or a process with another that is considered less hazardous
Engineering Controls – isolate people from the risk
Administrative Controls – training, signage
Personal Protective Equipment – clothing protecting the person

The costs associated with the potential controls must also be estimated or evaluated.

2.1

Assign Risk Owner

The RTD employee responsible for most closely mitigating, monitoring, and measuring the risk will be
identified and added to the Risk Register. The employee should be well informed of the risk, be at
the lowest /closest level of responsibility and have the authority to coordinate funding and or other
resources.

2.2

Safety Committee Structure

When a risk is identified, the local safety committee (e.g., Light Rail, Bus, Commuter Rail,
CyberSecurity, Safety & Environmental) will initiate the review and action. The local safety
committee will screen submittals for the difference between non-substantive complaints and
identification of true risks. The local safety committee will maintain the risk register, assign the risk
owner and work to evaluate, assess and mitigate (if required) the risk. If the risk requires mitigation
that exceeds the funding authority at this level, the risk will be elevated to the next higher-level
safety committee, the Joint Union/Management Safety Committee or ultimately to the Leadership
Safety Committee.
The Leadership Safety Committee is comprised of senior leaders of significantly affected
departments. The Leadership Safety Committee will meet monthly to review, assess progress, and
reallocate priorities of existing risks. Members include:

3. Assess Risk
Assessing risk is the process of determining the severity of risk and the probability of the risk being
realized. In order to ensure that risk assessments are consistent, it is important to utilize a standard
definition. The detailed severity and probability definitions for various events and departments are
provided in Appendix C.

4. Implement Controls
Mitigation actions to address risks will be
developed based on the evaluation and
assessment by the risk owners or safety
committees of the severity or probability of
risk.

the

Critical risks identified must be controlled or
eliminated so it does not continue to pose a
danger. This may be done in a temporary
manner until a permanent solution is
implemented. The process of controlling,
tracking, and eliminating risks is recorded
the risk register.

5. Monitor Results
5.1

Risk Register

The safety team will assure local risk registers are used to track risks at the departmental level within
RTD. These registers are to be maintained within the department and are reviewed by the local
safety committee on a regular basis. Risks placed on the local register receive their initial and final
risk rating using RTD’s 25 box risk assessment matrix. Management may also present risks to the
local safety committee for risk ratings. Risk ratings may be changed when new information is
received or as a result of further data analysis.
All risk register entries require a mitigation plan (if risk resolution is required), tracking number, brief
description, projected completion date, and an initial hazard rating/initial risk rating (IHR/IRR) using
the RTD Risk Analysis Matrix. Risk Register format example is provided in Appendix D.
If requested, or required for complicated risks, a CAP will be developed by risk owner/department
managers in conjunction with the safety committees. The committees/risk owners will ensure that
the CAP process is followed and properly tracked until it is closed. CAP's may be tracked and sorted
separate from the risk register. When a CAP is closed the risk register will reflect this action with a
closed date.
CAPs include the following information:
x
x
x
x
x

Element of activity identified as deficient
Planned activities to resolve deficiency
RTD department responsible for implementing corrective action
Scheduled completion date for implementation
Estimated cost of implementation

Packet Pg. 183

5.2

Monitor and Measure

A regular schedule of reviewing the effectiveness of mitigation actions will be established. For risks
without mitigation measures, a similar evaluation schedule should be established to determine that
the risk remains low.
In addition to the risks, the ORM process will be regularly evaluated to determine effectiveness,
compliance, and potential improvements. Audits (internal and external) are an excellent means of
conducting this evaluation.

6. Report Outcome
RTD risks will be reported in compliance with regulatory requirements and as part of the feedback
loop to increase data-driven decisions and to enhance the confidence in the ORM process.

6.1

Public Utilities Commission (PUC) State Safety Oversight Agency
(SSOA)

Report to the PUC SSOA on a monthly basis those issues and risks required for reporting within the
PUC’s jurisdiction. This reporting will provide status of mitigations and progress towards closing out
CAPs.

6.2

Employees

Report to strengthen the Employee Reporting System and enhance RTD employee confidence in and
use of the ORM process. Reporting can include posting of risk registers with updated mitigation
status.

6.3

Joint Union/Management Safety Committee

Report to the Joint Union/Management Safety Committee on high risks from each local safety
committee, and on mitigation actions requiring additional funding.

6.4

Leadership Safety Committee

Report to the Leadership Safety Committee on high risks from each local safety committee, and on
mitigation actions requiring additional funding.

Executive Summary
In 2016, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) mandated that every federally funded
transit agency in the United States must have a Transit Asset Management (TAM) Plan in
place by October 2018. RTD last completed a TAM Plan in 2022, and this iteration of the TAM
Plan reflects changes to RTD’s asset management system since 2022 and provides
information on the Asset Management Plan (AMP) horizon, conforming to section 625.29 of
Title 49.
TAM requirement nine mandates agencies to continually improve asset management
capabilities and to detail efforts to improve in the TAM Plan (Table 2).
For this iteration of the TAM Plan, the most notable improvements concern the light rail
infrastructure asset management practice. Consistent with the intent described in the prior
TAM Plan, RTD has made significant improvements to the maturity of both information and
process for light rail track assets. RTD’s track inventory now matches the level at which
assets are renewed and the level at which they are maintained rather than the granularity
commensurate with the level of the capital program. This improvement in inventory
granularity is also accompanied by meaningful improvements to the condition inspection
procedure and utilization of condition inspection information. RTD’s new asset management
strategy for track assets has been dubbed the “Age-Minus” approach. This method was
developed in response to a suite of business needs including:
x

to have a strong financial plan for renewals

x

to better utilize condition assessment information in renewal planning and ensuring
safety

x

to identify areas where wear or deterioration will likely result in a premature failure
at a point less than the expected useful life (EUL) of the asset

To maximize performance and reduce uncertainty in light rail track EUL, full-depth
replacements will be performed when track assets are renewed. A full-depth replacement
means that no components will be reused, and the track will be entirely renewed restoring
the EUL to the same as new construction. Because partial replacement of track components
does not deliver a known operational life extension, full-depth replacements are preferred. A
full-depth replacement provides the highest likelihood that a renewal will last the full design
life of the assets. In the management of track assets going forward, safe service at the
designed speed will be the highest priority. Secondly, the reduction of risk, specifically
defined as the effect of uncertainty on objectives, will be reduced.
Having been shown to deliver desirable results, the method for delivering the improvements
to light rail track will be expanded to other asset classes and groups. This method involves a
robust requirements gathering process in which cross-departmental and multi-disciplinary
teams are engaged to assess the quality, completeness and utility of information as well as
specific “pain-points” encountered by different functions. This information is used to develop
a single unified list of business requirements that serve as the plan for improvements. Once

Asset Management Policy
An Asset Management (AM) Policy is a documented commitment to achieving and
maintaining a state of good repair for all capital assets. The FTA has defined state of good
repair as “The condition in which a capital asset is able to operate at a full level of
performance” (Transit Asset Management; National Transit Database, 2016).
RTD’s Asset Management Policy was updated on August 11, 2022. The policy describes a
forward-looking commitment to good asset management practice, intended to pursue
investment optimization across the entire asset portfolio to maximize its value. Asset
management performed according to this policy will result in assets that are in a state of
good repair.
The latest version of the Asset Management Policy is included on pages 16 and 17 of this
document. This document is included as evidence of compliance with TAM requirement five
(5), and is the documented executive-level expectations for asset management in the
agency.

2 RTD and its Assets
The Regional Transportation District provides transportation services to over 3 million people
located within its 2,345 square mile service area, such services include bus, rail, paratransit
services, demand-responsive micro-transit services, and special event services. Though
operating a reduced schedule, RTD used these assets to provide over 48 million revenue
miles across all modes in 2023.

2.1

The RTD Story
The Colorado General Assembly created RTD in 1969. Efforts in early years
focused on regional transportation planning. In 1973, voters approved a 0.6%
sales tax initiative to finance a multi-modal transit system. At this time, RTD
acquired privately owned bus companies, improved service frequencies, and
expanded routes in several counties throughout the metro area. By 1976,
ridership had grown to 35 million boardings annually.
RTD celebrated its first light rail opening in October 1994. With a fleet of only 11
light rail vehicles, the 5.3-mile line attracted hundreds of thousands of customers
when it began operations. Now, eight light rail lines service 57 stations along
seven individually constructed corridors.
In November 2004, voters approved the FasTracks ballot measure for the regionwide expansion of transit service. The 0.4% sales and use tax continues to fund the
FasTracks program, which has grown to include 122 miles of new commuter rail and light
rail, 18 miles of bus rapid transit corridor, and numerous rail and bus stations. The program
consists of six new rapid transit corridors and three existing corridor extensions.

2.2

Service Area
The agency’s service area is composed of eight counties including all of Boulder, Broomfield,
Denver and Jefferson counties, large areas of Adams, Arapahoe and Douglas counties, and a
small portion of Weld County.

Figure 4: RTD District Map

In 2000, RTD provided approximately 77 million passenger trips. (U.S. Department of
Transportation, 2000) By 2019, passenger trips grew to 105 million, a 30% increase in
boardings. Over the same period, per the Colorado State Demographer’s Office, the
Denver/Boulder region increased from approximately 2.4 million residents to approximately
3.2 million residents, a 31% increase (2019). Unsurprisingly, due in large part to the COVID19 pandemic the agency experienced a severe decline in ridership in 2020, resulting in

approximately 52 million boardings for the year. (U.S. DOT, 2021) In 2023, the agency
reported approximately 65 million passenger boardings in a National Transit Database (NTD)
submission. While ridership is recovering, it is unclear when utilization of RTD’s assets by
customers will return to pre-pandemic levels.

2.3

RTD Assets
RTD is an asset-intensive organization. RTD’s Statement of Net Position notes that capital
assets total nearly $9.4 billion, excluding accumulated depreciation, of which most is within
the scope of TAM as detailed in this section. (Regional Transportation District, 2023)
As assets are operated, their condition degrades over time, and their risk of failure increases.
Failures, including those having an impact on safety, can manifest in a variety of ways. Asset
condition is therefore a leading indicator for safety risks, and understanding asset condition
today, and how quickly it might degrade in the future, is an important aspect of good asset,
safety, and risk management. Organizations that understand their assets’ deterioration rates
can also make more informed decisions on renewal frequencies and their approach to
preventive maintenance. RTD’s commitment to improve AIM to support decision-making is
expected to include data on the frequency and severity of potential failures of assets and the
components of systems that comprise them in accordance with the Operational Risk
Framework (ORF). Utilizing the ORF aligns the Asset Management System and Safety
Management Systems.
For the purposes of this TAM Plan, RTD has categorized its assets in accordance with FTA
guidelines: revenue vehicles, equipment, facilities, and infrastructure, using the flowchart
depicted in Figure 5 below, adherence to which ensures repeatable results and an
improvement in inventory data quality.

vehicles in this equipment group. Additional information includes the initial capital cost of the
assets along with the useful life benchmark (ULB), and a score representing the condition of
the equipment based on its age. The score range is from 1 to 5, where 1 indicates the asset
is significantly beyond its useful life benchmark and 5 is considered new. An asset that has
reached the end of its ULB is scored at 2.5, and from that point onwards is considered in
backlog. RTD uses the FTA definition for non-revenue vehicle backlog, which is the
percentage of vehicles that have met or exceeded their useful life benchmark. A non-revenue
vehicle that has reached the end of its ULB is scored at 2.5, and from that point onwards is
considered in backlog (U.S. Department of Transportation, 2016).

Figure 12: RTD Automobile

Figure 13: RTD Bucket Truck

Figure 14: RTD Truck

Figure 15: RTD Utility Truck

RTD has historically managed its non-revenue vehicle equipment inventory based on age; the
equipment is procured, maintained in a state of good repair for a specified number of years
through preventative maintenance and repair, and then replaced.5 As such, condition scores
for non-revenue vehicle equipment are age-based. However, the agency has departed from
planning for age-based renewals of assets in this category while an examination of the
utilization and utility of these assets is underway. Until such time as a new means for
evaluating the utilization and performance of assets in this class, and particularly vehicles
used primarily for administrative purposes, it is the expectation that few renewals will take
place within this class of equipment and vehicles will be knowingly operated in backlog.

The public facilities condition score represents the average of the attributes in Table 6, such
that existing elements have an equal contribution to the average condition score. (Regional
Transportation District, 2017).

Figure 19: Conveyance (elevator)

Conveyance inspections are outsourced to third parties in accordance with applicable
legislation and regulations but are not used to determine condition. These assets are
managed consistent with regulatory standards, parts obsolescence, and resolving operational
issues. Both preventive and reactive maintenance activities are performed by third parties,
and the activities delivered under these contractual agreements are monitored by RTD staff
to ensure contract adherence and acceptable performance of the assets.
Table 6 presents the total number of facility assets for which RTD has capital responsibility,
along with their EUL and a score representing the condition of the asset. The table provides
backlog for each asset, for which RTD uses the FTA definition for facilities backlog, the
percentage of facilities with a condition rating below 3.0 on the FTA Transit Economic
Requirements Model (TERM) scale (U.S. Department of Transportation, 2018).

RTD owned rail infrastructure includes grade crossings, catenary wire segments, track, relay
cases, switches, and substations; as well as light rail
and commuter rail vehicle bridges, and commuter
rail alignments operated and maintained by a third
party.

Figure 20: Light Rail Vehicle Bridge

Figure 21: Track Infrastructure

Light rail infrastructure is purchased from and constructed by a variety of manufacturers and
is owned, operated, and maintained by RTD. As described in the executive summary of this
document, RTD encountered issues with how the light rail infrastructure had historically been
managed and as a result has created a new strategy for managing these assets. The new
“Age-Minus” method takes into account asset age and condition in concert to inform
maintenance and renewal decisions concerning track assets. While age and condition are
strongly related, the combination has already been shown to improve insight into asset
condition. Both track asset age and assessed condition are reflected in Table 11. In a similar
fashion, RTD has near-term plans for improving other light rail infrastructure information,
again using the method described in the executive summary.
Seventy-seven light rail vehicle bridges are owned and maintained by RTD. Seven roadway
bridges above the light rail are inspected by RTD and owned and maintained by the Colorado
Department of Transportation. Light rail vehicle bridges are inspected once every two years
by an independent third-party contractor per state law. Defects noted in inspections are then
addressed through a combination of in-house and contracted resources, as determined by
RTD staff. Though inspection data is obtained from the third-party the inspection
methodology does not conform to the TERM scale. Condition assessments for bridges owned

and maintained by third parties are not recorded in the TAM Plan. As a result, the agency
relies on age-based scores to communicate the condition of assets to planning partners.
All commuter rail infrastructure was delivered under the FasTracks program. The operation of
the A, B, and G lines, as well as all commuter rail electrical power substations is outsourced
to DTO. RTD will assume ownership for these commuter rail infrastructure assets at the end
of the contracted period of performance (30 years from inception). Condition assessments
will not be performed on these assets until such time as RTD assumes capital responsibility.
In 2020, RTD opened a directly operated commuter rail line, the N Line. This directly
operated commuter rail infrastructure added to the diversity of RTD’s rail assets and is noted
separately from light rail assets and in more detail than the third-party controlled assets in
the inventory.
Table 10 presents the total number of light rail infrastructure assets for which RTD has
capital responsibility, along with their EUL and age-based condition, and backlog scores.
Table 11 displays Light Rail Track Miles by type. It is a significant change from previous TAM
Plan iterations reflecting the improvements to this asset class’s management strategy and
condition inspection methodology. While historically only age-based condition estimates were
provided, inspected condition is now also available. The table shows improved inventory
granularity. The interaction of significant track types reflects differences in cost and useful
life that result from differences in track design. The data are presented in groups reflecting
the track design aspects utilized in NTD reporting. Though age and inspected condition are
highly related, the improved depth of information significantly augments decision-making
capabilities.
Table 12 presents the total number of light rail and directly operated commuter rail vehicle
bridges for which RTD has capital responsibility, along with their EUL and age-based
condition scores.
Table 13A represents the number, EUL, and age-based score for key directly operated
commuter rail assets.
Table 13B represents the original directly operated commuter rail assets as reflected in the
Fixed Financial Assets records.
Table 14 represents the directly operated commuter rail track by type, noting the differences
in EUL between the types and relevant age-based scores.
Tables 15 and 16 represent the FTA performance measure for infrastructure which is the
percentage of guideway directional route miles (DRM) with performance restrictions by light
rail and commuter rail by class, respectively.
Changes to the light rail track mileage under performance restriction are reflected in Table
15. Significant portions of light rail track were under performance restriction in 2024. The
increase in performance restrictions reflect the closure of an approximately 4.4 mile section

judgement to determine whether to accept or modify the results of the initial AMP, this is
known as the validated AMP. This stage is also where asset stewards augment information
on “fact sheets” that are prepared by the AMD using the information from the system(s) of
record with additional information which will assist other stewards in appropriately prioritizing
the funding requests among other requests. The prioritized AMP has been the result of the
annual evaluation of information from the validated AMP requests by a panel of asset
stewards. The Asset Management Working Group (AMWG) has been convened where asset
stewards use the information available to them in the validated AMP stage to prioritize
requests. To better match the timing of the new FYFF which replaces the Mid-Term Financial
Plan (MTFP) prioritization of capital investments will now be completed each spring. This
change in timing is reflected in Figure 23.
The prioritization process has resulted in in the prioritized list of investments shown in Tables
20A through 20G. The prioritized AMP is then compared to available funding for asset
renewals and replacements. Funded requests become part of the budget in the FYFF and the
remainder of the renewal and replacement requests remain in the AMP process for
consideration in future iterations of that process. The AMP process is illustrated in Figure 22
and the relationship of each AMP cycle to the FYFF is shown in Figure 23.

roadmap to improvement. An ongoing project management effort was used to turn plans
into action and improve the state of asset management for light rail track assets. Having
achieved notable success using this method of requirements gathering and project
management, this method has begun to be propagated to other asset types to facilitate
similar improvements. Results of utilizing this method will be monitored to continually
improve the method in a plan-do-check-act method of continual improvement.
Historically, RTD has had the necessary funding in place to maintain its assets in a state of
good repair. However, RTD’s backlog of existing assets is growing and will experience swells
of assets achieving their respective EULs, such as those from pre-FasTracks expansion
activities including the original light rail alignment known as the Metro Area Circulator (MAC)
or Central Corridor, the Southwest light rail alignment, the Southeast rail alignment that was
a component of the T-REX project, and the Central Platte Valley (CPV) extension. The asset
renewal and replacement needs are expected to be $1.3 Billion for the 2024-2031 planning
period (Figure 25). Presently the AMP records reflect a funding need of over $187 million for
2024, which largely accounts for the backlog for assets in the scope of the TAM. (Figure 26)
The actual funding needs are likely higher due to assets out of scope of the TAM, assets that
have yet to be recognized in the AMS, and uncertainty around the infrastructure and facilities
needs that result from a lack of controlled and available asset information on which to
formulate data-driven plans. The known unfunded needs by asset type are summarized in
Figure 27. It is anticipated that the asset information maturity effort noted in the executive
summary of this document will shed light on the true needs of facilities investment within the
planning horizon of this iteration of the TAM Plan. By gathering requirements in a structured,
rigorous way, and project managing the efforts to deliver on those requirements the ability to
make data-driven decisions concerning facilities assets will be improved.
RTD’s asset management maturity improvement initiative was not initially driven by a
growing set of decaying assets, but rather by the expansion of the asset base in recent
years. Beginning with the T-REX project and continuing with the current FasTracks project,
over the past 16 years RTD has invested over $6.4 billion on new rail and bus rapid transit
service.
The funding for the most recent expansion projects did not make sufficient provision for the
long-term maintenance and capital renewal of the new assets. Without a solid, long-term
renewal plan in place with funding earmarked, the risk of a growing backlog of renewal
projects without adequate funding is too great to be unaddressed. In RTD’s financial plans
the AMP is fully funded. In addition, contributions to reserves are made in anticipation of
funding needs within the planning horizon that may exceed the ability to fund annually from
revenues in a particular year. This results in an average contribution of approximately $120
Million annually to fund the AMP.
A growing backlog for any transit agency increases risks to safety, service, and future
sustainability; it feeds a pattern of expensive reactionary repair and remediation tasks. The
AMP process and available funding are tools to ensure the future viability of the assets and

position the agency for providing value to the customers and community the agency serves.
RTD’s processes are focused on addressing backlog and ensuring safe, reliable service that
generates value for customers and the community.
On a routine basis RTD prepares an AMP that addresses future funding needs for existing
assets, prioritizing renewals over enhancements. The original cost of assets is less useful to
the agency than projected future costs. Therefore, RTD’s efforts emphasize creating accurate
and increasingly precise estimates of the investments that are needed over the coming
budget planning cycle as was recently done with the light rail track assets. Improvements in
AIM will facilitate the agency’s ability to forecast costs, estimate performance consequences,
and understand risk to achieving strategic objectives.
The AMP will determine which assets are included for renewal or replacement in the
investment prioritization process. The projected funding needs over the period 2024-2031 are
illustrated in the graphs that follow.

Strategic Asset Management Plan

RTD aims to comply fully with MAP-21 requirements for transit asset management and
beyond. It has developed an overall Strategic Asset Management Plan (SAMP) to summarize
its strategy to improve asset management over the next period.
From 2004, with the publication of BSI PAS-55, and then ISO 55000 in 2014, organizations
have been able to exploit a standardized good practice framework for implementing an
aligned AMS. This approach to utilizing an existing asset management framework is a best
practice and is still a focal point for the SAMP.
Typically, organizations begin with a focus on asset information, particularly the inventory of
all their assets and assessing asset condition. This information supports clearer planning,
because this allows the organization to fully assess its assets and their condition. The
intended result is not just a clear plan to cover all the assets, but a prioritized and optimized
plan based on understanding the risks to objectives and using this to make the best use of
limited resources. RTD has successfully employed an asset information maturity improvement
methodology within light rail track assets and expects to expand this effort to other asset
classes to ensure that information is available to support decision-making and planning for
RTD and its partners.
The current strategy is to focus on continued improvement of the agency asset management
capabilities through AIM improvement initiatives, utilizing principles of good asset
management and tools derived from ISO 55000 standards, though the agency will not seek
certification within the four-year scope of this TAM Plan. The SAMP is due to be revisited, and
it is expected that the adjustments from being focused on ISO 55000 certification to an
approach more centered on fundamental activities that improve the asset management
system by enhancing AIM.

5.2

Key Annual Activities
RTD identifies two types of asset management activity: those ongoing asset management
activities that RTD performs as part of “business as usual,” and those activities specific to
furthering the development and improvement of the AMP. TAM activities are the subset of
these, targeting the specific TAM elements, and are shown in a third section below.

5.2.1 “Business as Usual” Asset Management Activities
As an asset-intensive organization, RTD already performs several asset management
activities on a routine basis, and these will continue to improve through the TAM Plan
horizon.
This section summarizes those “business as usual” activities, using the Institute of Asset
Management’s Conceptual Model for Asset Management (2015) to categorize into six main
blocks. This should not be interpreted to imply these ongoing activities are all necessarily well
aligned or integrated at present.

Figure 31: The Institute of Asset Management (IAM) Conceptual Model for Asset Management

The Planning department periodically conducts demand analysis for
RTD’s transit service and uses this to support long-term strategic
planning for system optimization, expansion and enhancement. At
present, strategic planning for capital renewals and maintenance volumes is not formally
performed, though RTD anticipates the need to enhance its capabilities in this area through
the development of asset class strategies and the AMP (see next section for details).
RTD’s current approach to capital investment decision-making is
described in Section 3, and this activity is performed annually to
develop the FYFF. Operations and maintenance decision-making is
performed within each asset owner group.
Ongoing activities include capital project processes for asset
acquisition, which is split between the Capital Programs Department for
commuter rail and facility assets and the Operations Department for
rail, bus and rail infrastructure assets. Maintenance delivery occurs for
each major asset class and includes preventive and corrective maintenance, along with
condition assessments where warranted. Some asset classes have a larger focus on
preventative maintenance, while others have more emphasis on corrective maintenance and
maintain assets when they fail or are near failure. Most maintenance delivery is performed by
staff, with some being outsourced. Asset operations are a significant part of RTD’s ongoing
activities, and includes bus, rail, equipment and infrastructure operations, some of which are
also outsourced. Improved asset information and a focus on aligning to strategic objectives
will facilitate more effective resourcing strategies that ensure the resources to meet strategic
objectives are allocated. RTD also performs shutdown and outage management of its assets
to enable maintenance access. As assets develop operating faults, the agency implements its
fault and incident response plans in accordance with agreed methods.

RTD uses several asset information systems to manage its Asset
Information, including Trapeze EAM for asset inventory and
maintenance management, and the Oracle Enterprise Business Suite
for related financial information. Other systems including Railroad
Software have been added to address the specific requirements of light rail maintenance of
way and directly operated commuter rail maintenance of way (commonly referred to as North
Metro). However, these systems have not been fully integrated into organization processes.
There are several basic data and information management processes in effect, including
regular reporting to the NTD, and regular data quality assessment and cleansing processes
for Trapeze EAM information. The Asset Management Division employs a data science and
analytics team to support designated asset stewards with collection, management, and
analysis of non-physical data. This group also performs data assurance tasks on corporate
data and performs all FTA TAM report preparation activities.
The RTD data science and analytics team also administers the asset information maturity
(AIM) process, having designed the framework, administered assessments, and provided
significant consultative guidance in the development of AIM improvement plans and
professional support in the execution of many analytics tasks within the plans.
RTD applies procurement and supply chain management principles for
its outsourced asset management functions. These include procuring
design and construction services, along with some ongoing operations
and maintenance of assets. The operation and maintenance of
approximately half of RTD’s bus services is outsourced, and the maintenance of certain
facility assets, such as elevators, is also outsourced.
RTD’s Finance department uses standard accounting practices to
perform asset costing and valuation, including their valuation and
depreciation of assets over time. Integration of the ORF into AIM
improvement plans, in the renewal/replacement requests and more
broadly into other operational plans is expected within the period of this TAM Plan.

5.2.2 Asset Management System Activities
As previously stated, it is essential that an agency’s asset management system is aligned to
its strategic objectives. The activities to enhance the asset management system capabilities
are summarized in the aforementioned “Back to Basics” initiative that communicates the
agency’s commitment to asset management in the following way, “RTD strives [to] redouble
agency efforts to maintain assets in a state of good repair leveraging sound asset
management principles.” (Regional Transportation District, 2024) The ability for the asset
management system to deliver the right funding, in the right year, for the right reasons
requires effective processes and valid information. Much of the activities of the Asset
Management Division, working with groups throughout the agency, are aimed at improving
information and processes to deliver positive agency outcomes.

5.2.2.1 Design an Asset Management Organization
This includes the implementation of an AMS that meets the agency’s strategic needs: the
framework to define and manage the key elements, including a policy, strategy and risk
management framework, with clearly defined roles and responsibilities.

5.2.2.2 Asset Management Planning
This includes the development of asset class strategies and an AMP as key elements of an
investment planning process.

5.2.2.3 Improve Rigor and Control
This implements improved control over core asset delivery and financial activities and
includes improved information to aid in accurate and precise financial planning to meet the
agency’s strategic needs, not limited to those items with a particular asset management
focus in the strategic plan.

5.2.2.4 Assurance and Performance
In order to deliver on the Asset Management Accountability Team (AMAT) goal of achieving
an Optimized AMP, an improved performance management framework aligned to measure
those things most critical to delivery of the agency’s strategic plan will be required. It is not
anticipated that a unified organization-wide asset performance framework will be delivered
within the scope of this four-year TAM Plan. However, improved asset performance measures
may be a component of AIM initiatives in the coming years.

5.2.2.5 Enhance Asset Information
This is centered on the development and implementation of an AIM framework, including
definition of RTD’s information requirements and the strategies employed for meeting them,
along with clear governance for asset information. Without changes in organizational
structure, it is not anticipated that a unified, organization-wide asset register will be delivered
within the scope of this four-year TAM Plan.

5.2.2.6 Learning and Communication
This is to support the embedding of asset management awareness, culture and
competencies, and includes a training needs analysis and a program of appropriate asset
management training, as well as communication to raise awareness of asset management
throughout the organization, and the development of an appropriate asset management
culture.

5.3.2 Asset Management System Activities
The 2021-2026 Strategic Plan requires the establishment of a functioning, effective,
sufficiently resourced management system for assets. The resourcing strategy is to establish
clear accountability and responsibility for the Asset Management System, with the authority
to direct and allocate resources being granted to the accountable group. The diagram below
illustrates the accountability structure and other contributors.

Figure 32: ISO 55000 Contributing Resource Groups

In late 2011, RTD assigned two employees the task of building an Asset Management
Division (AMD). The Division would eventually be responsible for improving the management
of assets and building an agency-wide AMS.
To ensure the most accurate, non-biased information possible, the Leadership Team
determined the AMD should be independent of the asset delivery functions.
According to Chris Lloyd, asset management leadership and culture expert: “Strategic Asset
Management calls for risk-based decision making, cross-functional working, and long-term
thinking. It needs clarity on competence requirements and accountability and honesty about
performance” (Johnson and Lloyd, 2012).
The AMD was placed in the Finance Department in 2022 to facilitate greater alignment to
supporting the agency’s financial planning needs through delivery of the AMP processes and
products. More details are in Appendix F.
The AMD staff possess a wealth of asset management expertise, as a number of its
employees transferred from other areas of the agency, bringing with them significant
knowledge of agency operations, experience in maintenance of many asset classes, physical
asset business analysis, and/or data science. External hires provided additional subject
matter expertise, knowledge, skills, and abilities.

Packet Pg. 247

5.3.3 TAM Activities
The resourcing strategy for the TAM activities is not only to define an Accountable Executive
for all TAM requirements but to assign TAM responsibilities to the AMD. Supporting resources
from other agency departments will be utilized and consulted or informed on an as-needed
basis. Details of both the accountable executive and the AMD are in Appendix E.

6 Evaluation Plan
6.1

TAM Plan Evaluation
The TAM Plan will be evaluated on degree of compliance when RTD receives each triennial
audit.
However, the plan is intended to do more than meet compliance. It is a statement of
intentions and commitment to deliver the culture, policy, and procedural changes necessary
for the improved efficacy and efficiency of transit agencies that is implied in the regulations.
This TAM Plan provides a baseline for evaluating future TAM Plans produced by the agency.
RTD intends to regularly review its asset management maturity, setting maturity targets in its
SAMP. This document will also serve as a basis of comparison to peer agencies, allowing RTD
to learn from other TAM Plans to identify where improvements can be made.
RTD will periodically evaluate its performance against the previous cycle’s TAM Plan
improvement goals and agency objectives with documentation and explanation of progress
(Regional Transportation District, 2021).

Accountable Executive – A single, identifiable person who has ultimate
responsibility for carrying out the safety management system of a public
transportation agency; responsibility for carrying out transit asset management
practices; and control or direction over the human and capital resources needed to
develop and maintain both the agency's public transportation agency safety plan, in
accordance with 49 U.S.C. 5329(d), and the agency's transit asset management plan
in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 5326.
Asset Information Maturity (AIM) – This consists of a framework, an assessment,
AIM plans, and updates to the Asset Management Accountability Team on progress
towards stated objectives in plans. The framework that includes a six-stage model
indicating relative maturity that are mutually exclusive based on the availability of
information, the quality of data in its utility for decision-making/planning, the
presence or absence of a documented plan/procedure for the development and
utilization of data suitable for decision-making/planning, whether or not documented
plans/procedures are followed and monitored for adherence, and whether a ‘plan-docheck-act’ cycle of continuous improvement is applied to tune information and plan
quality to achieve organization objectives. The inventory consists of 24 items based
on ISO 55000 clauses 7.5 and 7.6 regarding information and its control. The plans are
signed documents available on the RTD intranet.
Backlog – State of Good Repair backlog is representative of the reinvestment cost to
replace any transit assets whose condition is below the midpoint on TERM’s 1 (poor)
to 5 (excellent) scale, or 2.5 for assets using age-based replacement or renewal
strategies including rolling stock, equipment, and infrastructure. For facilities,
condition inspections resulting in a score of 3 or less on the TERM scale shall be
considered to be in backlog.
Base System – Base System refers to RTD’s assets not included in the FasTracks
system. The Base System is supported in part by a 0.6% sales and use tax. Base
System funding and FasTracks funding are tracked separately.
Capital Responsibility – Transit agencies are required to report condition
assessments for assets that they own or jointly own with another entity, that they are
responsible for replacing, overhauling, refurbishing, or conducting major repairs on
that asset, or for which the cost of those activities is itemized as a capital line item in
the agency's budget.
CDOT – Colorado Department of Transportation.
Consist – A set of railroad vehicles forming a complete train.
Contracted Service – A contract for services is a formal, legally binding agreement
between RTD and a private company to provide service delivery.
Data Driven Decisions - The process of making organizational decisions based on
actual and verifiable data rather than intuition or observation alone. The approach
includes problem solving where a well-defined set of actions are driven by decisions
which are further driven by insights (extracted from data) using sound methods.
Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) – Denver’s metropolitan
planning organization (MPO). https://drcog.org/

Direct operated and purchased services – Direct operated services are those
services provided by RTD staff using RTD assets. Purchased Services are those
operated under contract on behalf of RTD using outside staffing. See also Contracted
Service.
Estimated Useful Life (EUL) – The Estimated Useful Life indicates the expected
duration in years that the asset will remain in service under normal operating
conditions and maintenance. This metric is agency-defined as opposed to FTA
established Useful Life Benchmarks. At the end of useful life of the asset, major
renewal or replacement is expected.
FasTracks – FasTracks is a ballot initiative that levied an additional 0.4% sales tax
for expansion of the RTD system. FasTracks introduced commuter rail service as well
as a Public Private Partnership (P3) to the system.
Five-Year Financial Forecast or FYFF – A portion of RTD’s total budget not
already committed to specific capital projects and not apportioned to ongoing
operations and maintenance that is evaluated and prioritized through a process
described in Section 3 of this document.
ISO 55000 – The international standard covering management of assets of any kind.
Prior to the establishment of this standard, a Publicly Available Specification (BSI PAS55) was published by the British Standards Institution in 2004 for physical assets. The
ISO 55000 series of Asset Management standards was formalized in 2014 and is
composed of three parts:
o ISO 55000:2014 Asset management – Overview, Principles and Terminology
o ISO 55001:2014 Asset management – Management Systems – Requirements
o ISO 55002:2014 Guidelines for the Application of ISO 55001
Leadership Team (LT) – Agency leaders who hold the title of Chiefs and/or
Assistant General Managers that lead departments and/or operating modalities
MAP-21 – MAP-21, the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (P.L. 112141) was signed into law by President Obama on July 6, 2012.
National Transit Database – A federal reporting program for transit agencies
receiving Federal Transit Administration (FTA) funding, which serves as a primary
repository for all transit-related data and statistics in the United States. The
performance data from the NTD is used to allocate FTA funding and to report on
public transit performance to Congress and researchers.
State of Good Repair – “The condition in which a capital asset is able to operate at
a full level of performance.” (Transit Asset Management; National Transit Database,
2016)
TERM – Transit Economic Requirements model is a tool used by the FTA along with a
numeric code that represents the categorization of assets, as indicated in the TERMLite model.
Useful Life Benchmark (ULB) – The Useful Life Benchmark indicates the expected
duration in years that the asset will remain in service under normal operating
conditions and maintenance. This metric is established by the FTA as opposed to the
agency-defined Estimated Useful Life metric. At the end of useful life of the asset,
major renewal or replacement is expected.

requirements and data quality standards are directly tied to these decision-making
needs. This alignment will clarify what data is essential and guide prioritization of data
improvement efforts
Expand the scope of asset information to include insights into asset design life,
utilization and performance, enabling a shift from age-based to performance-based
management approaches for key asset classes. This transition supports data-driven
decisions and aligns with RTD's objectives to enhance reliability and optimize lifecycle
investments

Staff resources
o One accountable executive
o Ten to fifteen FTEs from the Asset Management Division, who will split their
time between tasks associated with the AMP process and AIM initiative
o FTE requirements for other RTD resources necessary for TAM activities are not
defined in this generation of the TAM Plan
Technology resources: the technologies are used to support asset management
across the agency. RTD’s aim is to use the tools it already owns, rather than invest in
new ones at this time.
o Hardware and software necessary to support:
 Multiple source software systems – e.g. Trapeze EAM, Oracle EBS
 Data warehouse – provides aggregation and integration of data
 Analysis and reporting tools – Power BI, Access, Excel, SPSS and
others
Financial resources
o Financial resources necessary to support asset management ‘business as
usual’ activities, TAM and ISO implementation. Beyond these, RTD has not
defined any requirement for further resources for this generation of the TAM
Plan.

Appendix D: Asset Management Roles and
Responsibilities
1. Accountable Executive – a single position with ultimate accountability for Asset
Management and the Asset Management System within RTD. This is the General
Manager and Chief Executive Officer.
2. Asset Management Accountability Team (AMAT) – this group has formal
accountability delegated from the Accountable Executive for the delivery, embedding,
review and continual improvement of the Asset Management System. The group is
comprised of the Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operations Officer, and Assistant
General Manager for Capital Programs. Due to changes in organization structure,
personnel changes, the AMAT has been temporarily suspended.
3. Chief Financial Officer (CFO) – reporting directly the Accountable Executive, the
CFO chairs AMAT. This position is critical to developing an asset management culture.
In this role the CFO ensures the alignment of asset management initiatives to
strategic objectives. By having a robust understanding of agency needs, this
individual can guide the agency in the development, implementation and maintenance
of an AMS that enhances agency capabilities. This individual also ensures adequate
resourcing for the AMS overall, and the AMD.
4. Asset Management Division – the AMD is responsible for the design, delivery,
embedding, review and continual improvement of the Asset Management System’s
(AMS) products, processes and information. The AMD manages the AMP and AIM
initiatives. The Asset Management Senior Manager reports to the Chief Financial
Officer.
5. Other RTD resources – as needed, other RTD resources will be utilized, consulted
or informed regarding the AMS. This could include operations, maintenance, finance,
safety, human resources, communications, IT, capital programs, legal, and
procurement staff. The AMAT will allocate these resources directly when within their
reporting line or via a request to other members of the Leadership Team when they
are not.
6. External resources – RTD will also utilize external expertise to develop the internal
asset management competencies of both the AMD and other RTD resources involved
with the AMS. The alternative to this is to be continually reliant on an external entity
to supply expertise indefinitely. By having actions guided by both an established asset
management framework and interactions with consultants, RTD intends to cultivate
an AMD capable of acting as an internal consulting service to the agency. The
intention is to ‘own the process, not the product’ as it relates to functions and
competencies that will become annual activities for the AMD. Additional external
resources will also be utilized to deliver aspects of the AMS, specifically the operations
and maintenance of approximately half of the bus fleet and a large portion of the
commuter rail system.

Light Rail System Description

The RTD light rail system was designed as the ﬁrst piece of a planned regional rapid transit system. In 1989, the Colorado
Supreme Court declared that the Denver metro area Regional Transportation District was eligible to collect a use tax that
enabled the District to accumulate funding of $67 million for construction of a rail system.
The project was approved by DRCOG (Denver Regional Council of Governments) in 1991. Construction on the initial 5.3-mile
rail system and a functional operations facility began without federal funding or an increase in local taxes in October 1992.
Safety Certiﬁcation and Construction of the light rail system was completed by the end of September 1994, and the system
opened for revenue service with 11 light rail vehicles on October 7, 1994. Additional lines, facilities, and vehicles were added
in subsequent years with voter support, as detailed below.

I 5.1.1

Scope and Service

Regular service of the light rail system is regulated by timetables. Light rail transit currently carries roughly 40,000
customers daily. Trains operate as one-, two-, three-, or four-car consists. Revenue service is generally available 21 hours
per day.
The Regional Transportation District’s objective is to operate the light rail transit system safely, reliably, and efficiently and
to integrate light rail operation with bus service for the greatest convenience to the public. This is the means by which the
integration of transportation services could assist the region in meeting clean air standards, alleviating traffic congestion,
and improving the overall quality of life of the area.
Light rail service operates on the existing 5.3-mile Central Corridor, the 8.7-mile Southwest Corridor, the 1.8-mile Central
Platte Valley Spur, the 19-mile Southeast Corridor, the 12.1-mile West Rail Corridor, the 10.5-mile I-225 Corridor, and the 1.6mile Southeast Rail Extension (SERE). The system has six operating lines: D, E, H, L, W, and R.

I 5.1.2

Organizational Structure

The light rail transit safety specialist’s office is located at the Elati Light Rail Operations and Maintenance center. Thus, the
lines of communication between safety and light rail operations are effective. Key positions with light rail operations are:
•

Assistant General Manager, Rail

•

Deputy Assistant General Manager of Rail Operations

•

Senior Manager, Rail Operations, Planning & Systems

•

Business Program Manager

•

General Superintendent of Light Rail Transportation

•

Manager of Rail Service Delivery

•

Manager of LRV Operator Training

•

Manager of LRT Operations

•

General Superintendent of Infrastructure

•

Manager of Light Rail Maintenance of Way

•

General Superintendent of Light Rail Vehicle Maintenance

•

Manager of Light Rail Vehicle Maintenance

I 5.1.3

Light Rail Corridors

Central Corridor
Passenger service on the Central Corridor Light Rail system began October 7, 1994. The system is operated by Denver’s
Regional Transportation District as part of a fully integrated mass transit system, which includes local bus routes, express
bus routes, regional bus routes, shuttle bus routes, and demand-response service for disabled customers.
The Central Corridor comprises 5.3 miles of trackway with 13 stations, including three ark-n-rRde locations. The Central
Corridor operates at grade level except for one ﬂy-over structure for grade separation at Kalamath and Santa Fe. An initial
ﬂeet of 11 light rail vehicles (LRVs) were procured for the operation of the Central Corridor. Shortly after opening for service,
six additional LRVs were ordered.
The Central Corridor begins at I-25 and Broadway on the southwest end and terminates at 30th Avenue and Downing
Street. The corridor provides direct connections between the I-25 and Broadway Station transfer facility, Broadway
Marketplace, Auraria Campus, Colorado Convention Center, and the 16th Street Mall (Market Street, Civic Center, and Union
Station transit stations), Five Points, and many major hotels and businesses in between.
Major attractions within a short walking distance of the Central Corridor stations or the 16th Street Mall shuttles include the
Denver Center for the Performing Arts complex, federal courthouse, 17th Street Financial District, U.S. Mint, Tabor Center,
State Capitol, Denver Art Museum, Denver Public Library, History Colorado Center, Larimer Square, and Coors Field.
Light rail vehicles are operated manually. Automatic block wayside signals, traffic signals, radio communication, operational
procedures, and train orders govern operators regarding all vehicle movement. Appropriate street traffic signals, speed limit
signage, and wayside signals assist the operator in selecting proper movement sequence and speeds. City operations are
by line of sight. All city street crossings are governed by coordinating adjacent street intersection traffic signals, while the
at-grade crossings at 13th Avenue and at Bayaud are governed by gates with ﬂashers and warning bells. The crossings at
13th Avenue and at Bayaud are jointly used and maintained by Union Paciﬁc Railroad and RTD.
Station platforms are unattended and utilize automated fare equipment for ticket sales and ticket validation. Transit Security
Officers (TSO) monitor the proof of payment honor system. Roving rail supervisors, contracted security officers, and local
police departments provide platform security.
A 2.5-acre yard and the Light Rail Mariposa Facility is located adjacent to the Southern Paciﬁc Railroad switching yard near
6th Avenue at 655 Mariposa Street. Powered switches on the double track mainline provide access to and from yard leads
at either end of the storage yard, allowing access from ladder tracks into the shop. The Light Rail Mariposa Facility includes
a yard for vehicle storage and a maintenance facility for vehicle maintenance and system support maintenance. Central
Control is located on the second ﬂoor of the facility and is the operational governing authority for all mainline vehicle
movement. Central Control personnel (controller/supervisors) direct, control, and monitor revenue-service operations
using radio, telephone, and public address communications. Mainline operations are controlled by a schedule timetable
and directed by Central Control in accordance with established operating schedules, rules, and procedures. Controllers
implement all corrective actions necessary to maintain service schedules and to minimize adverse impacts of equipment
failures, emergency situations, or weather-related problems. In addition, some unit repair, facility maintenance, and nonrevenue maintenance occurs at RTD’s District Shops location.
The corridor begins on the south end with I-25 and Broadway Station. I-25 and Broadway station provides a major bus and
light rail transfer point and is a junction for the Southwest, Southeast and Central corridors. From Broadway proceeding
north a short distance is Alameda Station. After leaving Alameda Station, trains pass through Bayaud crossing and then
ascend the Santa Fe/Kalamath ﬂyover structure, returning to grade as the alignment passes the Mariposa facility before
entering 10th and Osage Station. From 10th and Osage, trains pass through the 13th Avenue crossing and then either travel
downtown (Central Corridor) or to the Central Platte Valley (CPV) Corridor. Continuing northeast on the Central Corridor
is Colfax at Auraria Station, which allows direct access to the Auraria Campus via a plaza and a bus transfer point. After
leaving Colfax at Auraria Station, the double track alignment proceeds across Kalamath Street and Speer Boulevard,
crossing a bridge structure over Cherry Creek along Stout Street to Convention Center Station near 14th and Stout streets.

At 14th Street, the inbound track turns east and then north to travel along California Street. The outbound track runs along
Stout Street between 14th and 19th streets. Two passenger stations are located on Stout, one at 16th Street and one at
18th Street. The inbound track along California Street travels in an automobile traffic contra-ﬂow direction from 14th to 19th
streets, servicing the 16th Street and California passenger station located on the 16th Street Mall, then continuing on the
single track northeast bound to the next passenger station, at 18th Street on California.
The alignment turns southeast on 19th Street, where it joins the track to Welton Street and where the double track travels
east on Welton Street to the 20th Street and Welton Station, located between 19th and 20th streets on Welton. The double
track alignment continues as it crosses over to the south side of Welton near 20th Street to 24th Street. Between 24th
and 25th streets, the double track conﬁguration transitions into single track. The single-track alignment is retained as it
continues northeast on Welton and proceeds to the 25th Street and Welton Station, located near 26th Street. Traveling
northeast along the alignment, the trackway approaches the 27th Street mini station located between 27th and 28th
streets, then transitions back into a double track conﬁguration as it enters the 30th Aand Downing northern terminus station.

Southwest Corridor
The Southwest Corridor opened for revenue service in July 2000. It is an 8.7-mile extension of the Central Corridor light
rail system from I-25 and Broadway in Denver to the end-of-line station at Mineral Avenue and Santa Fe Drive in Littleton. It
includes ﬁve light rail stations: Evans, Englewood, Oxford•City of Sheridan, Littleton•Downtown, and Littleton•Mineral. Each
station location has an associated Park-n-Ride, with the exception of Oxford.
The Southwest Corridor is a double track alignment operating in high-speed territory at a maximum speed of 55 mph. The
corridor consists of mixed-use operations including three freight railroad mainline tracks, two light rail tracks, and Santa
Fe Drive on the west side of the corridor. The entire corridor is grade-separated with the exception of a pedestrian-freight
spur crossing at the Evans station. Traditional active grade crossing equipment and signals including warning bells, lights,
and gates control this crossing. The light rail tracks parallel the freight mainline tracks throughout the corridor. To enhance
patron use, the light rail corridor resides on the east side of the freight rail corridor from I-25 and Broadway to Tufts Avenue,
and on the west side of the freight corridor from Tufts Avenue to Mineral Avenue. Two ﬂyover structures accommodate
grade separation between freight railroad and light rail tracks: one near Tufts Avenue, where the east/west transition
occurs; and one near Iowa, where the light rail tracks cross the Iowa freight spur track.
Leaving the I-25 and Broadway station southbound, the tracks cross over Mississippi Avenue on a bridge and continue
south to cross over Iowa Ave on another bridge. Shortly after crossing Iowa Avenue, the alignment rises on the Iowa ﬂyover
structure to pass over a freight rail spur track coming from the mainline on the west side of the light rail tracks. Once the
trackway returns to grade, the tracks pass under Evans Avenue and enter the Evans station. Continuing south from Evans
station, the mainline right of way passes the Elati Operations Facility and yard before crossing a bridge over Dartmouth
Avenue and into Englewood Station. Trains leave Englewood Station southbound and cross the bridge over Hampden
Avenue and continue to Oxford Station. From Oxford Station south, the alignment passes over Oxford Avenue and then
climbs the Tufts ﬂyover structure that transitions light rail from the east side of the freight track mainline to the west side.
Descending off the ﬂyover, the alignment passes over Belleview Avenue on a bridge before entering a below grade cut and
Littleton•Downtown Station. Continuing south from the station, the track climbs from the cut to grade and continues to the
end-of-line Littleton•Mineral Station.
An additional 14 light rail vehicles were added to the existing ﬂeet to accommodate the extension. The light rail vehicles
are Siemens Duewag SD100 and SD160 models, the same used for the Central Corridor. The Mariposa maintenance facility
was expanded to accommodate the ﬂeet size increase. All operational characteristics for the Southwest Corridor are similar
to the existing operational characteristics of the Central Corridor. Since service origination of the Southwest Corridor, 18
additional SD 100s have been placed into revenue service.

Central Platte Valley
The Central Platte Valley (CPV) corridor is approximately 1.8 miles in length, linking the existing Central Corridor light rail
line at Colfax Avenue to Denver Union Station. This is a double track alignment along the entire corridor, including the CPV
junction.
Packet Pg. 275

The CPV corridor begins at approximately Colfax Avenue and Rio Court (the location where the existing Central Corridor
light rail lines curves to the east under the Colfax Avenue viaduct). The alignment generally follows Curtis Street from Colfax
Avenue to west of 5th Street, on the western edge of the Auraria Campus. At this point, the alignment turns north and
parallels 5th Street and enters Auraria West Station. From there, the alignment crosses Walnut Street and enters Empower
Field at Mile High Station. From there the alignment parallels the Consolidated Mainline (freight), to the Ball Arena•Elitch
Gardens Station, then continues north and ends at Denver Union Station. Stations are located at the new administration
building of the Auraria Campus (Auraria West); near the existing “Sports Walk” that serves Empower Field at Mile High
Station near the stadium; at the pedestrian bridge serving Ball Arena and Elitch Gardens; and Denver Union Station.
The alignment has two at-grade crossings: 5th Street and Walnut Street, which include active warning devices for control
and safety considerations to mitigate impacts to traffic and pedestrians in these areas.
During major events, such as professional sports games and concerts at Ball Arena, Coors Field and Empower Field at Mile
High, special service will be provided with trains running as frequently as every four to ﬁve minutes between the event
venue and the Southwest and Southeast Corridors. Some of these special event trains may terminate at the I- 25/Broadway
station while other will continue to the Littleton•Mineral and RidgeGate Parkway end-of-line stations.

Southeast Corridor
The Southeast Corridor began revenue service in November 2006. It consists of 21 miles of double-tracked light rail
transit, beginning at the existing Broadway station and ending at RidgeGate Parkway Station. This includes an alignment
along I-225 in the median, from I-25 to Nine Mile Station at Parker Road. There are 16 stations: Louisiana•Pearl; University;
Colorado; Yale; Southmoor; Belleview; Orchard; Arapahoe at Village Center; Dry Creek; County Line; Lincoln; Sky Ridge;
Lone Tree City Center; RidgeGate Parkway; Dayton; and Nine Mile. All facilities, including RTD trains, stations, pedestrian
and bicycle facilities, and other design elements, are in full compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.
With the Southeast Corridor expansion, the Elati Light Rail Operations facility and yard were constructed at 2701 S. Elati
St. This was a necessity to accommodate the more than doubling of light rail vehicles and associated support needs that
accompanied the system expansion. North and south yard leads were cut into the existing Southwest corridor mainline
track just north of Dartmouth on the south and a short distance south of Evans station on the north. In January of 2006, the
Elati facility became the new operations center and the Mariposa facility became a heavy maintenance and repair shop,
while still maintaining the Control Center on the second ﬂoor.
The Southeast Rail Extension (SERE) opened for revenue service in May 2019. This extended double track rail service 1.6
miles from the former end-of-line station at Lincoln to the new end-of-line station at RidgeGate Parkway. Two additional
stations, Sky Ridge and Lone Tree City Center, are located on the extension.

Broadway to Colorado
The Southeast Corridor alignment begins with a wye connection south of the existing Broadway station, allowing vehicles
from the Southeast Corridor to access both the Southwest Corridor and existing light rail line to central downtown.
Following the wye tracks, the alignment rises above grade to pass over Broadway on an aerial structure. After crossing
Broadway, the alignment turns to the south along the southbound I-25 on-ramp and drops down to match the grade of I-25
and into Louisiana•Pearl station. This allows the LRT alignment to pass under the cross streets, maintaining a 17-foot vertical
clearance above the top of rail. Through the Narrows (Broadway to University), the alignment parallels I-25 between I-25’s
collector distributor road and Buchtel Boulevard. The tracks generally pass behind the abutment of the highway bridges

Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)

The RTD Light Rail System includes a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system. The SCADA system
provides two types of general functions: control over certain system elements from the Central Control Center, and system
monitoring and status information to the Central Control Center. The SCADA system allows light rail controllers certain
capabilities such as remote control to power down sections of the alignment and control over power track switches. It also
provides information to light rail controllers on the status of certain elements of the light rail system and train information.
SCADA information includes train locations, switch alignments, power status, signal status, and a variety of additional
system information.

I 5.1.5

Light Rail Vehicles

The RTD light rail vehicle ﬂeet consists of two models from Siemens: the SD 100 and the SD 160. The vehicles are very
similar and have two main differences. The SD 160 has an AC propulsion system and sliding plug doors, whereas the
SD 100 has a DC propulsion system and bifold doors. An initial ﬂeet of 11 light rail vehicles (LRVs) was procured for the
operation of the Central Corridor. Shortly after opening for service, six additional LRVs were ordered. As ridership grew, so
did the system beyond the Central Corridor, triggering orders of new LRVs. The SD 100 model is the original RTD vehicle,
and there are 49 of these vehicles in the ﬂeet. The SD 160 was originally ordered for the Southeast Corridor extension: 68
were delivered, with an additional 55 vehicles ordered for FasTracks, the ﬁrst of which arrived in August 2009. An additional
29 SD 160 vehicles were ordered in July 2018. RTD now has a total ﬂeet of 201 vehicles. The LRVs are 6-axle, singlearticulated, double-ended, bidirectional, high-ﬂoor vehicles. They are approximately 80 feet in length, 8 feet and 9 inches
in width, and 13 feet high, and they operate on a standard railroad track gauge of 4 feet and 8 ½ inches. They are powered
by 750 volts of direct current from an overhead wire and capable of speeds up to 55 mph. Each vehicle can seat 48 to
56 passengers and accommodate up to 61 additional standing passengers at normal loads. Additional standees may be
accommodated at a crush load capacity. Exhibits shows the vehicle layout and critical exterior measurements to maximize
the level of comfort with which customers are afforded for their trip. In addition, light rail vehicles are equipped with HVAC
and good lighting conﬁguration.

I 5.1.6

Operations

The Operations Control Center, which underwent a major remodel to accommodate the system expansion and SCADA,
governs the operation, control, and dispatch of light rail vehicles. Control maintains contact with the train operators by
means of a radio located in each light rail vehicle cab. Light rail operators also carry a portable radio to be used in case they
have to leave the cab or there is a radio failure. Controllers/supervisors rove throughout the system during operations. Their
role is to provide support and coordination between Central Control and light rail vehicle operators during an emergency
or upset in the system that may require a manual block operation, bus bridge, evacuation, or accident response and
investigation.
Current operations consist of six lines: D, E, H, L, W, and R.. The D Line extends from Littleton•Mineral Station to 18th and
California Station. The E Line extends from RidgeGate Parkway Station to Denver Union Station.. The H Line extends
from Florida Station to 18th and California Station. The L Line is a downtown loop between 14th and Stout streets and
30th•Downing Station. The W Line extends from Jefferson County Government Center•Golden to Denver Union Station.
The R Line extends from RidgeGate Parkway Station to Peoria Station. Typical headways vary from 5 to 15 minutes during
peak operations with increased service operated for special events. Early morning or late night headways on weekends
and holidays are typically 30 minutes.
In the case of an accident or a breakdown of the system, the Control Center controls train movement using a manual block
system. When necessary, bus shuttles are used to move passengers around a trouble area.

Bus Operations System Description

The Regional Transportation District was created by an act of the Colorado General Assembly in 1969 and became an
operating unit on July 1 of that year. The purpose of creating this agency was to provide a regional approach to public
transportation.
On January 1, 1974, RTD began collecting a half percent sales tax and became fully operational. RTD initially inherited 321
buses from Denver Metro Transit.
Many of these vehicles were over 20 years old. Total bus mileage was 9 million miles per year, with fewer than 20 million
customers annually.
Only one maintenance and storage facility existed for buses. There was little or no maintenance capacity for buses in the
small system operating in the District. These systems served several local areas and there was a private Denver-Boulder
bus line.
RTD began building a modern bus ﬂeet and its needed support facilities. In 1975, the six fragmented bus systems that had
provided service to different areas of the District were integrated into a single, uniﬁed system. New and improved service
became the focal points for future growth.
The improved service included the extension of routes; new local and express routes; more frequent service; new nighttime
service on many routes; increased service to the mountain areas of the District; exclusive bus lanes; and the inauguration
of special service for the elderly and disabled. Meeting special needs made RTD the ﬁrst transit system in the nation with a
comprehensive bus program to serve the needs of the elderly and disabled. All of these factors led to a signiﬁcant increase
in ridership.

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_Exhibits_2026_v1_Redacted_v1 (5178 : 2026 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

1.E.1.c

To support and encourage new customers, RTD also launched a program to establish Park-n-Ride facilities. Additional bus
maintenance and storage facilities were acquired to accommodate the growing bus ﬂeet.
Packet Pg. 280

The 16th Street Mall bus service became operational in 1982. This was the ﬁrst step in a unique transit concept, which would
pull 50 percent of the buses off downtown streets during peak hours and provide opportunities for additional suburban
service.
In 1994, RTD partnered with the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) to add High-Occupancy Vehicle (HOV)
lanes from I-25 to US 36, allowing regional and express routes running along US 36 and I-25 to downtown Denver to
bypass congestion around the Turnpike Tangle.
In 2016, RTD began operating the Flatiron Flyer Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) service along US 36 and the I-25 HOV lanes,
seamlessly connecting Boulder and Denver. Later that year, RTD began operation of 36 BYD K10MR all-electric buses on
the 16th Street Mall, making it one of the largest electric bus ﬂeets in the nation. The District has evolved into a transit
system that has a service area of 2,342 square miles. It serves 40 municipalities in all or part of eight counties. The system
comprises 148 routes. The ﬂeet currently has 1,011 buses, of which 434 are leased to private carriers. There are currently
four maintenance and storage facilities Districtwide, 77 Park-n-Rides, and six transfer stations.

I 5.3.1

Scope and Service

Regular service of the ﬁxed route bus transit system is regulated by timetables and varies between peak and off-peak
hours, weekends, weekdays, and special events. The bus system transports an average of 200,827 weekday boardings.
Denver Union Station and Civic Center Station are the main transfer stations in the downtown Denver area.

I 5.3.2 Organizational Structure
The bus transit safety specialist’s office is located at RTD headquarters, at 1660 Blake St. in Denver. Key positions within
bus operations are the assistant general manager of bus operations, deputy assistant general manager of bus operations,
general superintendent of bus transportation, , general superintendent of bus maintenance, and general superintendent of
street supervision, Manager of contracted service, and business program manager. All of these key positions have regular
contact with the bus transit safety specialist.

I 5.3.3 Bus Transportation Operations
Dispatch governs the operation, control, and dispatch of buses and other RTD vehicles. Dispatch maintains control with
bus operators by means of two-way radios, standard telephones, and Global Positioning System (GPS). Street Supervisors
also carry portable radios in the event of a system failure. Street Supervisors rove throughout the system during operations.
Their role is to provide support and coordination between dispatch and bus operators during an emergency, accident
response and investigation, rerouting, or other bus-related issues.
Bus transportation Operations is responsible for providing safe, reliable, and efficient service to all areas served by our
mass transit system. This is accomplished by scheduling bus service from three operating divisions with732 full-time and 93
part time bus operators. Service is provided seven days a week over approximately 21 hours of each day.
Street supervisors monitor service and performance of bus operators to ensure the safe, efficient, on-time delivery of
scheduled bus service. The district also provides continuous evaluation of routes, schedules, bus stops, shelters, and
facilities to determine the effectiveness and condition of service and amenities.
Effective, two-way radio communication is provided to all revenue and non-revenue vehicles. Information is received and
relayed to the proper sources to provide assistance and coordination for bus operations. Communication is provided
through the radio system, telephones, and a state-of-the-art tracking system.
The District also monitors bus service provided by private contractors, which operate approximately 58% of RTD’s ﬁxed
route service. Assistance is provided to customers at transit centers, transfer stations, and customer care. The District also
coordinates special community events planning. In the event of a transit emergency, Dispatchers and street supervisors will
coordinate bus activities.

RTD Emergency Operations Plan
The Regional Transportation District's (RTD) Emergency Operations Plan (EOP), including all
annexes and appendices, provides a comprehensive, flexible framework for system-wide
emergency management affecting the agency and is effective as of the date signed by the
General Manager and CEO.
The EOP addresses the roles and responsibilities of emergency management of RTD
departments, as well as partner agencies, and provides a link to federal, state, local, territorial,
tribal, and private organizations and resources that may be called upon to assist and participate
in response to incidents that occur throughout RTD’s service area.
The EOP was developed using recognized state and federal guidance that includes: Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Target Capabilities List; FEMA Core Capabilities;
FEMA’s National Preparedness Frameworks; the National Incident Management System (NIMS);
FEMA’s Comprehensive Preparedness Guide (CPG) 101; FEMA CPG 201; the Colorado
Emergency Management Program Guide; and relevant laws and authorities pertinent to
emergency management in Public Transportation.
The EOP is designed to minimize the disruption of the agency’s core function by establishing a
system of collaboration during times of significant disruption. To meet this goal, it is imperative
that RTD, partner, and stakeholder agencies, and their personnel prepare, train, exercise,

RTD Emergency Operations Plan
Recognizing that significantly disruptive events can occur anytime and have far-reaching
impacts, RTD has developed the following Emergency Operations Plan (EOP) to guide response
activities and ensure effective and efficient coordination. The EOP enhances the agency’s ability
to help prevent, prepare for, respond to, recover from, and mitigate against all hazards that
threaten RTD and its customers, employees, resources, equipment, and surrounding
environment.
RTD’s service area is exposed to a number of hazards, discussed later in this document and
within the hazard-specific plans in Annexes G-N. The EOP includes information for the
preparation, response, recovery, and mitigation for an all-hazards approach to emergency
management. In addition, the Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP, 2023) identifies systems to
maintain the operations of RTD despite disruption and may be a useful reference during
emergencies. Further, the Cybersecurity Incident Response Procedure (CIMP, 2022) outlines
how RTD will respond to a malicious attack upon its information technology infrastructure and is
included in this document as Annex K. This document also incorporates Functional Annexes
(Annex A-F) supplied by each group: Bus Operations, Commuter Rail Operations, Light Rail
Operations, Paratransit, Capital Programs, and Transit Police.
The EOP utilizes emergency management principles such as a whole community planning
process and will incorporate partnerships with governmental entities and the private sector.
Emergency management principles are designed to include individuals with access and
functional needs, such as mobility challenges, Limited English Proficiency as well as any agerelated need.
RTD will activate the EOP when the agency must respond to an emergency that requires
coordination across transit modes and agency functions and with local, state, federal, territorial,
and tribal governmental entities. In addition, RTD may activate the EOP to coordinate support
for a pre-planned event.
The EOP addresses the roles and responsibilities of departments within RTD, as well as partner
agencies, and provides a link to federal, state, local, territorial, tribal, and private organizations
and resources that may be called upon to assist and participate in response to incidents that
occur throughout the locations that may default to this EOP pursuant to Colorado Revised
Statute § 24-33.5-707.

Introduction

9
Packet Pg. 322

1.E.1.c

Purpose
The purpose of the EOP is to establish the necessary framework to support a coordinated
response to all incidents across the agency and RTD’s service area as it relates to RTD service
including federal, state, and local governmental entities as well as private sector organizations.
It assigns roles and responsibilities for all RTD departments and divisions for preparedness and
response activities before, during, and after an emergency. It also provides for the systematic
integration of additional emergency resources but does not replace other federal, state, or
national emergency operations plans or procedures. Further, it does not remove responsibility
for each functional group (bus operations, light rail, commuter rail, paratransit, transit police,
and capital programs) within RTD to develop their own procedures, policies, and standard
operating procedures for managing emergencies.
The EOP is comprised of a base plan and supporting annexes, appendices, policies, and
procedures. The base plan establishes the structure and provides guidance for a timely and
coordinated response, internal communications, information gathering, information sharing,
decision-making, and roles and responsibilities for coordinating incident operations. The
annexes, appendices, procedures, and policies provide the tools that support the
implementation of the base plan. The EOP is drafted to be adaptable to any situation in which
RTD responds to an emergency regardless of the level of severity and outlines how to prevent,
prepare for, respond to, recover from, and mitigate the potential hazards identified within RTD’s
service area.
Further, this plan prescribes the activities to be taken by RTD’s Leadership Team and public
safety leadership to protect the lives of customers, employees, property and environment in the
event of a natural, human-caused, or technological emergency, including acts of terrorism.

Scope
This plan applies to all agency operations within the service area and all staff and property
owned by the agency.
Each department and division listed in the EOP is responsible for understanding its own
emergency authority and procedures when implementing the provisions of the EOP.

RTD Emergency Operations Plan
RTD was created in the General Assembly of the State of Colorado in 1969 by Chapter 231
Laws of Colorado 1969, currently codified part 1 of article 9 of title 32, Colorado Revised
Statutes to provide mass transportation to the inhabitants of the region. RTD is governed by a
15-member, publicly elected Board of Directors, with each Director representing approximately
200,000 constituents within their respective district.
RTD operates in eight counties with coverage of the entirety of Denver, Broomfield, and
Jefferson counties and partial coverage in Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Douglas, and Weld
counties. These counties contain 40 municipalities. RTD’s service area covers 2,342 square
miles populated by more than three million people.
RTD’s operates bus, light rail, commuter rail, and paratransit services. Rail operates on fixed
alignments with RTD owning or leasing rights of way. Three of the four commuter rail
alignments are operated by Denver Transit Operators/Partners. All light rail, and the N Line of
commuter rail are entirely operated by RTD. Bus service is provided through fixed route and ondemand service, accomplished with roughly 50 percent of buses operated by contractors. Fixed
routes are reviewed three times annually to make adjustments for changing landscape and
efficiency. Paratransit is entirely on-demand with all service delivery provided by contractors.
There are 9,750 bus stops along 140 bus routes, 113 miles of rail service including 78 stations
along 10 rail lines, and 96 Park-n-Ride facilities. Denver Union Station (DUS) is the central hub
of the system, with A, B, G, and N commuter rail and E and W light rail lines terminating there.
Amtrak trains are also dispatched into DUS.
The agency includes the Transit Police and Emergency Management Department, which
enforces RTD policies and procedures and protects the safety and security of RTD customers
and employees. This is the only department within RTD with traditional first response
responsibilities.
RTD’s service area includes Denver International Airport, which is the third busiest passenger
airport in the world in 2022 and a critical resource for the provision of emergency supplies. The
airport is serviced by the A Line commuter rail service, which connects the airport to DUS, as
well as AB1, AT/ATA, 104L, 145X, and 169L buses. In addition, the service area includes
portions of interstates 70, 76, 25, and 225. Major thoroughfares also include E-470, US 6, US
36, US 285, and US 287/I-70 Business Corridor.
Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) railway and Union Pacific railroads are the main freight rail
operators in the service area, at times running parallel to RTD rail.
RTD also participates in the North Central Region/Urban Area Security Initiative (NCR/UASI) to
coordinate preparedness activities with the surrounding counties and municipalities.
The lands within RTD’s service area were historically inhabited by indigenous people of the
hinono’eino’ biito’owu’ (Arapaho), Tséstho’e (Cheyenne), Očhéthi Šakówiŋ (Sioux), and Núuagha-tʉvʉ-pʉ̱ (Ute) Tribes. These tribes are still thriving with active governing bodies and
cultural celebrations both within the service area and in the reservations they were forcibly
removed to in surrounding states.

Planning Assumptions
x

RTD is not the primary public safety agency with jurisdiction at its locations throughout
the service area and will collaborate with local police, fire, and emergency medical
personnel to conduct critical life-safety response operations to save lives, reduce or
treat injuries, and to protect property and the environment

x

RTD, the communities within the service area, and state governmental agencies have
effective prediction and warning systems in place allowing RTD to anticipate certain
emergency situations that may impact the agency

x

When anticipating or in response to an emergency situation, the General Manager and
CEO (GM/CEO) and Chief of Transit Police and Emergency Management are responsible
for taking action, including the activation of this plan, to mitigate impacts, save lives,
protect property and the environment, assist survivors, and restore services and
facilities

x

RTD board members, GM/CEO, the Leadership Team, which consists of the agency’s
chiefs and assistant general managers, supervisors, represented and non-represented
employees, and partners are familiar with the EOP, understand their roles and
responsibilities under the EOP, maintain appropriate plans, policies, and procedures to
carry out those responsibilities; and maintain a state of readiness. Day-to-day functions
that do not contribute directly to emergency operations may be suspended for the
duration of an emergency/disaster. Resources that would normally be required for
those daily functions may be redirected to tasks in support of the emergency response

x

RTD will use its own resources in response to an emergency or disaster. Once agency
resources are exhausted (or near exhausted), requests for assistance will be made

x

A large-scale emergency or disaster may overwhelm available agency resources, leading
to the need for support from local/mutual aid jurisdictions, private sector partners, state
agencies, and the federal government

x

When resources of RTD are fully committed and mutual aid from communities within
the service area is exhausted, the Colorado Department of Homeland Security and
Emergency Management (CDHSEM) may coordinate the provision of additional
assistance to address unmet needs

x

Disaster support from federal agencies may take at least 72 hours to arrive

x

In the event that an evacuation of a community within RTD’s service area, or any part
thereof, is ordered, the majority of the evacuees will utilize their own transportation
resources to evacuate. However, a percentage of the population does not have access
to transportation and will require transportation assistance

x

Individuals with pets will bring their pets with them when they evacuate. Those with
livestock or other farm animals will take appropriate measures to safeguard their
animals via sheltering or evacuation as appropriate

x

RTD and its response partners will need to provide additional/enhanced assistance to
individuals with access and functional needs, including but not limited to children,
elderly, those with limited English proficiency, and individuals with disabilities and/or
chronic conditions

Concept of Operations
The concept of operations describes the sequence and scope of emergency response. The
Transit Police and Emergency Management Department has the primary responsibility for
coordinating emergency management activities under the auspices of RTD. These activities
support the following priorities:
x

Minimize injury and loss of life

x

Minimize property damage

x

Minimize adverse environmental and economic impact

x

Maintain the highest level of service possible to maintain consistency throughout
emergency conditions

x

Provide for the needs of survivors

Plan Activation
The EOP and its associated Annexes will be executed in whole or in part as directed by the GM/
CEO, the Chief of Transit Police and Emergency Management, or their designees in response to
an existing or an impending emergency. This plan may also be activated under the following
circumstances:

x
x
x
x

At the time of an actual disaster or emergency
When a community that RTD serves has declared a local state of emergency
When the Governor of Colorado has declared an emergency for areas within RTD’s
service area
When a Presidential Declaration of an Emergency or Disaster is issued for areas within
RTD’s service area

Phases of Emergency Management
RTD’s Emergency Management Program addresses all phases of emergency management for all
types of incidents, including mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery.

1.E.1.c

RTD Emergency Operations Plan
From the National Preparedness Goal 2nd Edition published by FEMA (2015):

Prevention includes those capabilities necessary to avoid, prevent, or stop a threatened
or actual act of terrorism. Unlike other mission areas, which are all-hazards by design,
Prevention core capabilities are focused specifically on imminent terrorist threats,
including on-going attacks or stopping imminent follow-on attacks.

RTD Transit Police and Emergency Management Department has primary responsibility for the
prevention of terrorist or other criminal activities as it relates to the agency and its operations.
This is accomplished by close coordination with federal, state, and local law enforcement
agencies to share information about potential threats to the agency and communities within its
service area as well as conducting active video surveillance. Each individual within RTD supports
this effort by reporting indicators of terrorism, violent extremism, or other malicious actors to
RTD Transit Police and Emergency Management Department.

Protection

The protection mission relates to the ability to secure and protect people, critical infrastructure,
and vital interests against human-caused and natural events. This can include activities such as
the securing of facilities, the IT network, or hardening of the supply chain.

Mitigation

The goal of mitigation is to prevent future loss by reducing or eliminating risk. Mitigation
activities like the recovery and preparedness phases of emergency management can occur
before or after an emergency. The goals of pre-emergency mitigation activities are to reduce
the chances of an emergency happening or reducing the damage suffered from unavoidable
emergencies. The goal of post-emergency mitigation is to reduce the impact of future hazards
and is a part of the recovery process.

Response

Response is the actual provision of emergency services during a crisis including the coordination
and management of resources to support emergency response operations. These activities help
to reduce casualties and damage and to speed recovery. Response activities include resource
and logistical coordination, addressing immediate life safety issues, stabilization of the incident,
and public information.
RTD responds to emergencies by activating the EOP; activating the EOC; coordinating with
public, private, and NGO partners as needed; coordinating and managing resources in support
of emergency response, and preparing for recovery activities.

Recovery

Recovery activities may be both short-term and long-term, ranging from conducting damage
assessments, removing debris, restoring essential utilities such as water and power, restoring
IT infrastructure and services, and restoring revenue service through repairing or replacing
damaged vehicles, facilities, or rail. Recovery may also incorporate mitigation measures

Direction, Control, and Coordination
National Incident Management System (NIMS)
RTD’s emergency management organization is structured in accordance with NIMS and ICS.
NIMS integrates existing processes and methods into a unified national framework for incident
management. This framework forms the basis for interoperability and compatibility that enable
a diverse set of public and private organizations to conduct effective incident management
operations.
It does this through a core set of concepts, principles, procedures, organizational structures
(ICS, multi-agency coordination, and joint information systems), terminology, and standards
requirements applicable to a broad community of NIMS users. To ensure interoperability and
compatibility, NIMS is based on an appropriate balance of flexibility and standardization. It
provides a consistent and flexible national framework within which government and private
entities at all levels can work together to manage domestic incidents, regardless of their cause,
size, location, or complexity.
Incident Command System (ICS)
Emergency management and incident response in RTD is coordinated using the ICS. ICS
enables effective incident management by integrating a combination of facilities, equipment,
personnel, procedures, and communications operating within a common organizational
structure. ICS is used to organize both near-term and long-term operations for a broad
spectrum of emergencies, from small to complex incidents, both natural and manmade. ICS is

1.E.1.c

Incident Command
Single Incident Commander - Most incidents involve a single incident commander. In these
incidents, a single person commands the incident response and is the decision-making
authority. The on-scene IC has tactical control of and authority over all resources at the scene.
First responders will establish Incident Command when they are on scene. RTD will always
defer authority to first responders while they are on-scene but will establish consistent
communication in a liaison function to provide information about RTD vehicles, facilities, and
response procedures. Information is to be shared freely with first responders as it becomes
available. When possible, the individual who would assume Incident Command after first
responders leave should be the liaison with First Response Incident Command.
In the event of an emergency/disaster occurring on an RTD revenue vehicle, the operator or
conductor will begin the event as the IC. They will notify their appropriate dispatch or control
center and their street/field supervisor of the event. When the supervisor arrives on-scene, the
supervisor will take over as Incident Command. An appropriate transfer of command must
always take place when a new incident commander assumes command.
In the event of an emergency/disaster occurring at an RTD-owned facility, the highest ranking
or most qualified facilities maintenance staff present will begin the event as the IC. They will
notify their appropriate dispatch or control center and their facilities maintenance manager of
the event. When the Facilities Maintenance Manager arrives on-scene they may choose to
assume Incident Command, or to leave the current IC in charge. An appropriate transfer of
command must always take place when a new incident commander assumes command.
The IC has the authority to request resources to facilitate response, including (but not limited
to):

1.E.1.c

• ICS 300-Intermediate ICS for Expanding Incidents
These trainings will give the supervisors and sworn police officers the competency to work
within ICS and integrate with other local response agencies to preserve life safety, reduce
damage to property and reduce impact to the environment. From the time of this policy being
adopted or from promotion to a relevant supervisor position, individuals will have six months to
complete all trainings.
Unified Command
A Unified Command involves two or more individuals sharing the authority normally held by a
single IC. A Unified Command acts as a single entity. It is important to note that in Unified
Command the command representatives will appoint a single Operations Section Chief.
An example when Unified Command may be used would be an intentional, malicious derailment
of a train, where Transit Police and Rail Supervisors will work together to make decisions
regarding the response.
Transfer of Command
Responsibility can be transferred during an incident for several reasons. As the incident grows
a more qualified person may be required to take over as IC to handle the ever-growing needs
of the incident. Or this may occur in reverse; when an incident reduces in size, the command
can be passed down to a person with less experience, but who is still qualified to run the nowsmaller incident. Other reasons to transfer command include jurisdictional change if the incident
moves to a different location or area of responsibility, or the normal turnover of personnel due
to extended incidents. The transfer of command process always includes a transfer of command
briefing, IC to IC, with the objective to give a complete picture of all events and considerations
that may impact the response and decision-making abilities of the new IC. This briefing may be
oral, written, or a combination of both. A transfer of command is posted and announced on all
radio and communication networks, especially with notification to the EOC.
Incident Coordination and/or Response Structures
Various types of operational support facilities are established in the vicinity of an incident,
depending on its size and complexity, to accomplish a variety of purposes. RTD may operate
one or more of the following incident coordination and/or response facilities during an
emergency or disaster:
x
x
x

ICP
EOC
Staging Area
Evacuation Transportation Hubs

Incident Command Post (ICP)
An ICP is the field location where the IC operates, onsite response is directly coordinated, and
onsite resource needs are identified and communicated. There is only one ICP for each incident
or event, but it may change locations during the event. The ICP may be located in a vehicle, the
Mobile Command Post, or within a building. The ICP will be positioned outside of the incident
scene and the potential hazard zone but close enough to the incident to maintain a visual

RTD Emergency Operations Plan
Emergency Operations Center (EOC)
The RTD EOC serves as the central point for coordination of the agency’s emergency
management and response activities. The EOC does not usurp the responsibility or authority of
the IC but instead supports incident command while mobilizing resources, tracking costs,
planning for future needs, providing decision making support and liaising with the Leadership
Team/Policy Group as needed. Like Incident Command, the EOC is scalable and flexible.
RTD has designated a primary and secondary EOC, which can be activated as necessary:
Primary EOC:

District Shops
Mezzanine Training Rooms
1900 31st St
Denver, CO 80216

Secondary EOC:

711 Building
Ste 10
711 W 31st Ave
Denver, CO 80202

The EOC may also be activated in a virtual or hybrid stance using an RTD-approved platform.
Identified and trained EOC representatives will be invited to the Virtual EOC (VEOC) channel
and will participate in the discussions as activated on an event by event basis.
The Emergency Management Specialist will serve as the EOC Manager and has the authority
and responsibility for managing the EOC and the agency’s emergency management organization
during an emergency or disaster. The EOC Manager has the authority to make all routine
decisions and is charged with advising the Leadership Team and the General Manager and CEO
when major decisions need to be made. The EOC Manager serves as a liaison with the local
jurisdictions’ emergency management agencies as well as state and federal agencies.
EOC Goals
The following are the general goals for the emergency operations center. These goals can be
adjusted by the EOC Manager in coordination with the General Manager and CEO, Chief of
Transit Police and Emergency Management, and the IC, when the EOC is activated.
x Obtain and maintain situational awareness of the incident and ensure responders
have a common operating picture
x Establish an incident planning cycle
x Manage resources (people, places, things) including tracking the status of
requests, the status and utilization of resources, and planning for the
demobilization of resources
x Procurement of emergency supplies
x Establish a seamless transition from response into recovery operations
x Assess and document impacts from events for recovery process

Activation Level Three (Watch): The EOC activates to activation level three (AL-3) when
only public safety staff from Transit Police and Emergency Management are needed to closely
monitor a developing incident or threat. At AL-3, the EOC will begin gathering situation
awareness information, but emergency coordination is largely left to the routine processes and
procedures maintained by each department or division.
Activation Level Two (Partial): The EOC is activated to activation level two (AL-2) when
some, but not all, EOC positions are needed to manage an emergency. The EOC Manager is
responsible for determining which positions are needed to meet the agency’s needs. The
following are examples of triggers for when an AL-2 activation may be appropriate:
•
•
•
•
•

A request for EOC activation from an IC
An incident resulting in 10 or more serious injuries or fatalities
A credible threat of terrorism or mass violence as determined by RTD-PD, local
jurisdiction police department or the Colorado Information Analysis Center
A forecast from the National Weather Service of a blizzard warning or a prediction of
major flooding or wildfire with significant impact
A significant disruption in service requiring off-scene coordination of resources to
provide information or resources.

Activation Level One (Full): The EOC is activated to activation level one (AL-1) when all EOC
positions are needed to manage an emergency. The following are examples of triggers for when
an AL-1 activation may be appropriate:
x
x
x

EOC Staffing
The EOC will be staffed utilizing a hybrid ICS/departmental model. Representatives are
expected to be knowledgeable individuals with authority to make emergency-related decisions
for their department/division. Lists of EOC representatives will be maintained by the leadership
of each discipline expected to maintain staff prepared to report to the EOC and be able to
provide this list to the Emergency Management Specialist every six months and upon request.
Each mode of transit, bus, light rail, commuter rail, and paratransit, must maintain at least
three trained EOC representatives. This allows for relief if the EOC must be activated on a 24hour basis as well as providing coverage if one of the two primary EOC representatives are
unable to report for duty for any reason.
The following lines of service must also have trained EOC representatives, with the exact
number noted below:

Depending upon the event triggering the activation, additional roles may be assigned outside of
a representative’s normal work. This is to be expected in emergencies, especially those where
an on-scene ICS structure is not in place.
EOC Activation
The EOC will be activated at the request of the General Manager and CEO, Chief Operations
Officer, Chief of Police and Emergency Management, the Emergency Management Specialist, or
IC or any of the above position’s designees. Upon request, the Emergency Management
Specialist/EOC Manager will determine the appropriate level of activation and required
representatives.
Notification of EOC activation will be sent to trained representatives and Leadership Team using
ReadyOp over text and call. Only one representative will be asked to go to the EOC unless
otherwise noted.

Policy Group
The Policy Group is made up of the General Manager and CEO and their selected designees.
The General Manager and CEO may choose to consult with the Chair of the Board regarding
decisions made by the Policy Group. Should the General Manager and CEO be unable to form
the Policy Group, the COO holds the authority in their absence.
The objective of the Policy Group is to provide high level decision-making where the EOC
Manager does not have sufficient authority to make a necessary decision. Examples of Policy
Group level decisions may be:
x
x
x
x
x
x
x

Whole system service suspension
Office closures
Shutdown of the entire RTD IT network
Reappropriation of staff
Financial expenditure above $25,000
Collaboration with labor representation
Long-term relocation of RTD facilities or staff

Members of the Policy Group are not required to staff the EOC and will be requested to appoint
another representative to the EOC in the event they are present, to allow proper delegation and
accomplishment of EOC objectives.
EOC Table of Organization
Following is a sample of what role each department’s representatives may be asked to fill in an
emergency. This is not prescriptive and may be adjusted depending upon the event triggering
the activation. Leadership of each section may or may not be assigned based upon complexity
of staffing or the event.
Representatives working in the EOC will be asked to liaise between their departments and the
EOC and while staffing the EOC are acting outside of their steady-state role and hierarchy.

Information Collection, Analysis and Dissemination
Situational Awareness
There are five elements that are the backbone of good situational awareness:
x
x
x
x
x

Define the information requirements
Determine how to gather information
Decide who will analyze that information
Determine how that information will be shared
Choose the technology that will help communicate and manage the information

During the initial period of an emergency, efforts should be focused on gaining an
understanding of the situation and establishing incident priorities. A well-defined, operational
information collection capability is essential. Information collection provides situational
awareness to leadership and promotes informed decision-making. The agency has designated a
process to collect, analyze and disseminate information during an emergency to both internal
and external response partners as well as the public.
Information Collection
Information will be collected from a variety of sources. EOC Manager or their designee at the
EOC will be charged with collecting information. The following list contains examples of
potential sources of operational information:
x Revenue Vehicle Operators, Via Communications Centers
x On-scene responders (street/field supervision, facilities staff, etc.)

Information Analysis
After information has been collected, it must be analyzed to determine its credibility and
operational relevance. The EOC Manager or their designee will analyze information that is
received and prepare intelligence reports for leadership.
Dissemination
Message dissemination is categorized into internal messaging and public messaging. Internal
messaging refers to messages crafted for responders, employees, contractors, and partners,
while public messaging refers to messages crafted for public dissemination.
Internal Messaging
EOC Manager or his/her designee in the EOC will assist in conveying information as necessary
to responders, RTD departments and other partners. Additionally, EOC Manager or their
designee will maintain and update the Incident Action Plan (IAP), which will contain critical
information and intelligence updates.
Within two hours of an emergency event, the EOC Manager will brief the Policy
Group/Leadership Team with details for the event and response.
Public Messaging
Various methods of public information dissemination are available. The decision to use a
particular medium will be based on the urgency and the intended audience. Some methods of
distribution include:

x
x
x
x
x

Service alerts
News releases
News conferences

1.E.1.c

organizations, and agencies to work together depends greatly on their ability to communicate
with each other. To effectively transmit and receive information, emergency response partners
supporting the community must have access to all available forms of communication. This
section outlines the types of equipment/systems available for internal, external and public
communication. Operational communications systems and capabilities, and effective
communications, are essential to the success of any emergency operation. The community
maintains and operates the below communications systems to ensure effective and operation
communications between municipal personnel and with other jurisdictions.
Communications between community agencies occur through the use of several types of
communications equipment including radios, cellular and landline phones, email, and satellite
phones. In addition, the State of Colorado uses WebEOC to provide situational awareness.
The radio system RTD uses is supported by the State and is utilized by first responders across
the region and State. This is an 800 MHz system and has redundant towers in the Denver
Metro Area. All radio talk groups have access to MetroNET, which is the mutual aid channel in
the Denver Metro Area. RTD’s system is segregated into bus operations, rail operations,
transit police, and some single channels available for support services such as treasury
maintenance. There is only one encrypted channel available and it is on the police talk group.
Bus operations is set up to facilitate on-demand communication, where all other channels are
push-to-talk. The radio system is maintained by IT’s Mobile Technologies group.
In addition, RTD’s Emergency Management Specialist sends situational awareness updates for
events that may require emergency coordination.
Alert and Notification
RTD utilizes service alerts to inform customers and the public about disruptions to the system.
This is predominantly sent via app alerts and emails for registered users on selected routes of
importance to the individual. The organization also communicates with the public via news
releases and media advisories.
Customer Care is also a point of contact for the public to make requests via phone or online
communications. These are on-demand communications available 6 a.m. – 8 p.m. Monday
through Friday and 9 a.m. – 6 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday.
Notification of Key Leaders

When an emergency requires the notification of key community officials, Emergency
Notification will be done using the Emergency Notification Procedure (RTD-EM-PRC0001).
Further updates will be made using:

EOC Communications

RTD’s EOC is equipped with, maintains and is capable of operating, the following
communication systems: Computers with Microsoft Teams, cameras, microphones,
Outlook, telephones, and radio.
RTD conducts periodic communications tests to ensure that its systems are operational,
and its personnel are capable of operating the systems. More particularly, Emergency
Management Specialist conducts an emergency communication test on a semiannual
basis.
Public Warning
Public warning is accomplished using the following methods as appropriate:
x Service alerts
x RTD website notifications
x Public information displays
x Public announcement systems
Public Information Officer (PIO)

The PIO has roles and responsibilities as identified in the Crisis Communications Plan
which includes:
x Determine or create proper message content
x Select appropriate communication method
x Disseminate public warnings after receiving written approval from the EOC
Manager or their designee
During non-emergency times, information regarding emergency plans and actions to be
taken by the public, in the form of public information and education materials, will be
provided to the public via newsletters, brochures, and RTD’s website and social media
platforms.
During an emergency, the potential for dissemination of false or misleading information
is high. This can lead to operational difficulties for responders and confusion among
the public. Misleading information can be produced from several sources. RTD will
establish a media monitoring and rumor control section in the EOC and staffed by
Communications and Engagement staff.

Employee Reassignment
During an emergency, certain employees may be reassigned to complete alternate duties that
differ from their regular day-to-day responsibilities. Department administration will coordinate
with Human Resources to manage incidents and ensure staffing levels are appropriate. In
general, RTD job descriptions for non-represented employees include an ‘other duties as
assigned’ or ‘other duties as required’ clause that can be activated for emergencies. This may
require approval of the Policy Group when not previously identified in this document.
Worker’s Compensation
Worker’s compensation claims are administered by the Risk Management Division according to
Colorado Revised Statutes C.R.S. 8-40-101, et seq. Even in an emergency employees should be
encouraged to file a workers’ compensation claim to ensure they receive appropriate medical
care and lost wage benefits related to on-the-job injuries.
Insurance and Financial Liability
RTD is self-insured for tort liability up to the limits specified under the Colorado Governmental
Immunity Act and has additional insurance policies in place to support the financial recovery of
the organization. For this reason, it is important to coordinate with the Risk Management
Division to ensure proper record-keeping and investigative processes are followed. These
policies include excess workers compensation, crime, fiduciary, cybersecurity, excess liability,
property and railroad liability insurance.
Timekeeping
Tracking employee time spent on emergency operations can be an important aspect of
determining disaster costs and opportunities for reimbursement by the federal government
through FTA or FEMA. RTD maintains the same timekeeping policies during regular operations
and emergency operations, but salaried employees should use Workday to log any applicable or
qualified hours worked, especially those above 40 hours/week. There may be a specific code
assigned for disaster operations hours worked.
Represented employees will use Kronos or TIES for their timekeeping needs, according to their
steady state timekeeping policies. If for some reason Workday, Kronos, or TIES are unavailable,
employees are to track hours manually and appropriate Finance Department staff shall make
necessary adjustments as the systems become available.
Records Retention
Records retention during emergencies is conducted using the same policies and procedures in
place during regular operation. The Records Management Procedure and Records Retention
Schedule Policy, created and maintained by the Information Management and Governance
Division can be found on the agency’s intranet, i.e., “The Hub.” Records to be retained during
and after an emergency include personnel hours, equipment costs, expenditures/procurement,
costs incurred by RTD, etc. in compliance with RTD policies and procedures and C.F.R. Title 44,

and activities, including after action reports must be retained for a minimum of three years, in
compliance with the Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan.
Documenting Response and Recovery Operations
RTD will use IAPs and SitReps to document response and recovery efforts. Other
documentation will be used to record cost recovery information, requests for aid, budget
control, legal advice, operational efficiency, and other relevant areas of response and recovery
activities.
After Action Reporting (AAR)

Emergency Contracting
Emergency and post-disaster contracts will be managed by the Contracting and Procurement
Division. Allowing emergency contracting during an emergency is an important way to avoid
lengthy contract bidding processes and speed up response and recovery efforts; however, it
should be carefully managed in order to prevent RTD and the taxpayers from potentially
overpaying for goods and services by failing to facilitate appropriate competition for taxpayer
funded contracts. More detailed information about emergency contractors can be found in the
Procurement Standards Manual or its successor document.

Plan Development and Maintenance
EOP Coordination
This EOP will be promulgated every three years. The reviews, revisions, updates, and changes
made to the plan will begin with the Emergency Management Division of the RTD-PD, which will
then elevate the plan as needed if signatures are required for the changes to the plan. If any
necessary plan changes originate outside the Emergency Management Division, the need for
updates will be communicated to the appropriate department via email to ensure version
control and accountability.

Annex A: Bus Operations
Purpose
The purpose of this Annex is to define the actions and roles necessary for the Bus
Operations Division to participate in a coordinated response within the framework of the
EOP . This Annex provides guidance to groups within the Bus Operations
department/division with a general concept of potential emergency assignments before,
during, and following emergency or disaster situations.
Bus Operations Division is responsible for delivery of all RTD rubber-tired transit
services, except paratransit. RTD bus operations consists of nine operational divisions,
described in Characteristics and five organizational groups within RTD:
1. Contracted Servicesџ responsible for overseeing the delivery of all RTD rubbertired services delivered by RTD's contracted transit service providers, including
fixed-route and demand responsive services.
2. Maintenanceџresponsible for maintaining RTD's directly operated rubber-tired
fleet, including transit vehicles and support services.
3. Street Operations: responsible for the coordination and supervision of all bus
services in operation.
4. Transportationџ responsible for the training of RTD bus operators and the
delivery of RTD directly operated bus services.
5. Administrationџ responsible for administrative duties and high-level decisionmaking for all divisions of Bus Operations.
Bus Operations oversees more than 150 Local, Regional and Skyride routes and serve
10,000 bus stops throughout the service area. The RTD bus system operates 365 days
a year, 24 hours a day. Bus operations addresses the unique needs and challenges of
all individuals by facilitating accessibility, mobility, and community involvement through
RTD programs and services. The Bus Operations fleet consists of more than 1,000
transit vehicles, 300 non-licensed vehicles, such as lawnmowers, and 450 licensed
support vehicles operating out of four RTD divisions and five private contracted
divisions. Of the five contracted divisions, four are fixed-route contactors one private
contractor operates RTD’s FlexRide service in 24 areas throughout the District.
Scope
The Bus Operations Division will provide scheduled and demand response bus service to
the public, leveraging necessary human and physical resources. Bus operations will, to
the degree possible, support other operations divisions, including rail, to provide
auxiliary services, such as bus bridges, during rail emergencies or outages. Bus
operations will continue to maintain and support the support services fleet, which
extends to all departments in the agency. This Annex applies to all staff, equipment,
subdivisions, and operations of the Bus Operations department and associated divisions
and primarily describes the department’s emergency actions.

1.E.1.c

Street operations oversees the daily processes of the OCC (Dispatch) and Street
Supervision. They work closely with external agencies throughout the service area to
maintain an efficient and reliable transit network. The Street Operations subdivision is
managed by the General Superintendent and Assistant General Superintendent of Street
Operations and supported by Street Supervision, Dispatch, Station Starters, Sign
Maintainers, and Sign Fabricators.
Street operations supervises the coordination, preparation, and update of all detours
affected by special events, emergencies, or service disruptions. Street operations also
works closely with law enforcement, jurisdictions, and municipalities for on-street
activities and detours affecting bus operations. Street Operations also coordinates
emergency response with the RTD Office of Emergency Management.
The Contracted Services Group is managed by the Senior Manager of Contracted
Services and serves as the liaison between RTD personnel and the private contractor
personnel. Private contractors operate approximately half of RTD fixed-route service,
and all FlexRide (demand response) service. In addition, contracted services plans all
special services and ensures that adequate personnel (both RTD and private
contractors) are available to provide the service. Contracted services also serves as the
conduit for service related partnerships throughout the District.
Equipment used across all divisions typically consists of radio handhelds for field
communications, supervisor vehicles for field assignments and emergency response,
buses and associated support systems, such as CAD/AVL, for providing transit service to
customers, non-revenue vehicles for management and other staff.

system are controlled, and operational decisions are made regarding scheduled and
emergency operations.
Maintenance of Way (MOW) and Infrastructure
Responsible for the maintenance of the agency's rail right of way including traction
power substations, OCS, signal systems, track, and track right of way such as rail beds
and structures.
Commuter Rail Oversight
Commuter Rail Contract Services (aka Oversight) oversees the Concessionaire
Agreement (CA) with DTP and its operator DTO, which operates the A, B, and G lines
through the CA with RTD. Oversight oversees operations and maintenance delivery to
ensure the Eagle 3P Concessionaire is meeting contractual requirements as well as
regulatory requirements. The oversight team provides support to the commuter rail
lines and interfaces with all responsible members performing operation and
maintenance.

To provide additional context to commuter rail operations, described below is the
commuter rail systems and equipment components to maintain rail system operations.
WIMAX
The WIMAX system provides system monitoring and status information
to OCC. WIMAX information includes train locations, speed, positive train control, and a
variety of additional system information.
Commuter Rail Vehicles
The fleet consists of 66 individual Hyundai Rotem units also referred to in this document
as Electro-Mechanical Units (EMU), using a 25K OCS. All vehicles are maintained by DTO
at the commuter rail maintenance facility located at 5151 Fox Street, Denver, CO.
CR Maintenance Facility
The commuter rail facility located at 8215 Steele Street, Commerce City, CO is
where general maintenance, repair and rolling stock storage for the N Line occur.
Operations
OCC governs the operation, control, and dispatch of commuter rail vehicles.
Dispatch maintains contact with the train engineers and conductors by means of radios
located in each commuter rail vehicle cab. Commuter rail engineers and conductors also
carry a portable radio to be used while outside of the cab or in case of cab radio
failure. Field supervisors rove throughout the system during operations. Their role is to
provide support and coordination between Dispatch and commuter rail vehicle engineers
and conductors during an emergency or upset in the system that may require a manual
block operation, bus bridge, evacuation, or accident response and investigation.
Current operations consist of one line:

N Line – Denver Union Station to 124th Station in Thornton
In the case of an accident or breakdown of the system, the controller will monitor
movement and control train movement using a manual block system. When necessary,
buses are used in a bridging procedure to move customers around a trouble area.
OCS – Overhead Catenary
OCS for the commuter rail system is the overhead catenary wire. Approximately
25,000 volts AC is fed to the overhead catenary wire. Contact between the overhead
wire and the Commuter Rail Vehicle (CRV) is through the CRV pantograph located on the
top of the CRV. For all incidents or maintenance involving the OCS, the pantograph
should be lowered to remove electrical hazard from the CRV.
Grade Crossings
The system has 49 Grade crossings: 13 pedestrian rail-grade crossings at stations and 36
highway-rail grade crossings. Nearly all the highway-rail grade crossings will be in quiet
zones and most crossings feature:
x Quad gates or concrete medians
x Loop detectors to prevent vehicles from becoming trapped between the gates
x Advanced preemption closed circuit television pedestrian treatments
o Many locations include gates
o Tactile warning strips with truncated domes
Pedestrian crossings are protected with a combination of flashing signals, audible bells,
and ancillary ‘another train approaching’ signs. These warning devices will be controlled
with fixed approach audio frequency track circuits.
Signals and Train Control
Commuter rail uses a traditional cab-signaling Automatic Train Control system in
conjunction with a Positive Train Control (PTC) overlay system. There are wayside signals
only at interlockings. The PTC system uses Wabtec’s Interoperable Electronic Train
Management System to meet FRA requirements in accordance with the 2008 Rail Safety
Act including:
• Prevention of train-to-train collisions
• Enforcement of over-speed limits (including civil, routing, temporary)
• Prevention of incursions into established work zone limits
• Prevention of movements over switches set in the wrong direction (in
interlockings and hand throw switches)
The PTC system uses a combination of fiber and wireless communication technologies
deployed in a redundant manner to provide a robust, reliable and highly-available system.

Commuter rail operations has three operating facilities, which are active 24 hours a day,
365 days a year, these facilities include:

Annex C: Light Rail Operations
Purpose
The purpose of this Annex is to define the actions and roles necessary for the Light Rail Operations
Group to participate in a coordinated response within the framework of the RTD EOP. This Annex
provides guidance to groups within the Light Rail Operations Group with a general concept of
potential emergency assignments before, during, and following emergency or disaster situations.

Scope

This Annex applies to all staff, equipment, subdivisions, and operations of the Light Rail
Operations Group and primarily describes the group’s emergency actions.

Situation Overview
Characteristics
The Light Rail Operations (LRO) subdivision is responsible for providing safe and reliable train
service. RTD light rail currently operates six light rail lines providing approximately 60 light rail
system miles (double track) with 57 rail stations and operates 365 days a year.
LRO services and maintains 201 Light Rail Vehicles (LRVs) and maintains all track, signals,
overhead catenary system, and right of way access. In addition, light rail maintains all
certifications for train operators, electro mechanics, signal/traction power maintainers, track
maintainers and rail laborers. Safety procedures and practices are continuously reviewed to
ensure safety.
RTD Light Rail Operations consist of four subdivisions:

Light Rail Administration (LRA)

Provides the overall management for light rail operations. This group includes all departmental
budgeting, fiscal planning and monitoring, capital project planning, performance monitoring, data
analysis and overall reporting, educational development, regulatory compliance, and
safety/quality assurance through internal assessments/audits. Project management is provided
for all rail vehicle procurements. Oversight and technical expertise are provided for corridor rail
construction projects.

Light Rail Transportation (LRT)

Responsible for providing safe and reliable service, and provides alternated schedules for events
such as the Denver Broncos, Colorado Rockies, large concerts, etc. The OCC provides 24/7
coverage, serves as a command-and-control facility and is the main location from which all
aspects of the system are controlled, and operational decisions are made regarding scheduled
and emergency operations.

Light Rail Vehicle Maintenance (LRVM)
Maintains all certifications for light rail mechanics and is responsible for ensuring the maintenance
and cleanliness of the district’s rail fleet. In addition to preventive maintenance, accident repairs,
electrical/electronic diagnostics, service and cleaning of the vehicles, this group provides

RTD Emergency Operations Plan
Maintenance of Way (MOW) and Infrastructure

Responsible for the maintenance of the district's rail rights of way to include traction power
substations, OCS, signal systems, track, and track rights of way such as rail beds and structures.
In addition, the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) group provides oversight of
the fiber optics and information technology to function and maintain the SCADA system that
enables staff to visually track and control the vehicles and wayside equipment, such as substations
and track switches, in the district's rail corridors.
To provide additional context to light rail operations, below describes the different light rail
systems and equipment components to maintain rail system operations.

Light Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition

The SCADA system provides two types of general functions: control over certain system elements
from the Central Control Center; and system monitoring and status information to the Central
Control Center. The SCADA system allows light rail controllers certain capabilities such as remote
capability to power down sections of the alignment and control over power switches. It also
provides information to the light rail controllers on the status of certain elements of the light rail
system. SCADA information includes train locations, switch alignments, power status, signal
status and a variety of additional system information.

Light Rail Vehicles

The RTD light rail vehicle fleet consists of two models from Siemens: the SD 100 and the SD
160. The vehicles are very similar and have two main differences. The SD 160 has an AC
propulsion system and sliding plug doors where the SD 100 has a DC propulsion system and bifold doors. The SD 100 model is the original RTD vehicle and there are 49 vehicles in the
fleet. The SD 160 was originally ordered for the Southeast Corridor extension: 68 were delivered
with an additional 55 vehicles ordered for FasTracks plus an additional order of 29, the first of
which arrived in August 2009 with delivery ending in 2020. RTD now has a total of 201 revenue
service vehicles.

LRT Maintenance Facility

The Mariposa facility is a heavy maintenance and overhaul facility for cars and major components.
The Elati facility is the operational facility with a capacity of 201 light rail vehicles. Mariposa is
also used for some vehicle storage and pull-out activity to accommodate future expansion.

Operations

OCC governs the operation, control, and dispatch of light rail vehicles. Control maintains contact
with the train operators by means of radio located in each light rail vehicle cab. Light rail
operators also carry a portable radio to be used while outside of the cab or in case of cab radio
failure. Controller/supervisors rove throughout the system during operations. Their role is to
provide support and coordination between OCC and light rail vehicle operators during an

emergency or disruption in the system that may require a manual block operation, bus bridge,
evacuation, or accident response and investigation.
Current operations consist of six lines:
-

D Line, 18th and California to Littleton Mineral
E Line, Union Station to RidgeGate Parkway
H Line, 18th and California to Florida
L Line, 16th & Stout to 30th – Downing
R Line, Peoria to RidgeGate Parkway
W Line, Union Station to Jeffco Government Center

In the case of an accident or breakdown of the system, the controller will monitor movement and
control train movement using a manual block system. When necessary, buses are used in a
bridging procedure to move passengers around a trouble area.

System Power – Traction Power Substations and Overhead Catenary

System power for the light rail system includes two critical elements: traction power substations
(TPSS) and the overhead catenary wire. TPSSs are located approximately one mile apart along
the light rail alignment. Approximately 13,200 volts AC is fed to the TPSS. The TPSS converts
this feed to a nominal 750 volts DC and supplies the 750 volts DC to the overhead catenary
wire. Contact between the overhead wire and the LRV is through the LRV pantograph located
on the top of the LRV.
For incidents involving no damage to the overhead wire and no significant damage to the side
or top of the LRV, the incident can most likely be managed without removing power, i.e.,
without shutting down TPSS and without lowering the pantograph. For incidents with major
LRV damage, the pantograph should be lowered to remove electrical hazard from the LRV. If
an incident involves damage to the overhead wire or if the overhead wire and pantograph are
entangled, power should be removed in one of two ways: utilize emergency shut off located in
locked box on nearest TPSS, or request power removal from light rail OCC.

At this company, the following types of emergency evacuations exist: Fire, Flood, Tornado.
Our emergency evacuation procedures and assignments are designed to respond to many
potential emergencies that require them, including:
Facility fires, Earthquakes, flooding that affects the facility’s safety and Chemical releases.
Employees need to know what to do if they are alerted to a specific emergency. After an alarm
is sounded to evacuate, employees should take the following steps:
Immediately evacuate their area to the designated rally point. Supervisors/shift leaders should
verbally inform any and all staff to evacuate.
Management and Supervisory personnel must perform facility sweeps to account for all
employees, visitors, contractors, or other persons know to have been in the facility during and
immediately following the evacuation.
Once evacuated, employees are to head toward their designated exterior or safe area, where a
head count will be performed, and further instructions given. Following is a list of exterior
refuges/safe zones:
Procedures to Account for Employees
Trained evacuation personnel assist in safe and orderly evacuation for all types of emergencies
that require evacuation. Once evacuation is complete, they conduct head counts. The
employees selected are trained in the complete workplace layout and the various alternative
escape routes from the workplace. Before leaving, these employees check rooms and other
enclosed spaces in the workplace for employees who may be trapped or otherwise unable to
evacuate the area. A report on the status of any persons unaccounted for should be given
immediately to emergency services upon their arrival. A list of trained personnel appears

Training
Transdev’s Plan Administrator reviews the Emergency Action Plan at the following times with
each employee covered by the plan:
•
•
•
•

•
•

Initially when the plan is developed,
whenever a new employee is hired,
whenever the employee is assigned initially to a job,
whenever an employee's responsibilities or designated actions under the plan change,
whenever new equipment, materials, or processes are introduced into the workplace,
whenever the layout or design or the facility changes, and
whenever the plan is changed.

The training includes the following:
Review of the plan, mock emergencies, and evacuation drills.
The information in this plan is not intended for casual reading but is intended to get the
appropriate message across. We present the material for training in the following manner:
•

•

Safety Meetings,
Senior Staff Meetings
Initial Training

The contents of this plan are communicated through a briefing delivered by supervisors
followed by a demonstration.
The contents of this plan are communicated through a presentation followed by a drill.
Transdev Services, Inc. performs drills for the following emergencies:
Any and all evacuation alarms. These drills are held at least annually.
After a drill, the Plan Administrator judges the effectiveness of the plan and reviews any
employee input concerning the drill. Employees performing the drill may identify something that
did not follow procedure or was ineffective. For example, they may discover doors that would
not open; they may enter storage closets instead of exiting; they may get lost and confused or
they may carry a suspicious package through the facility. These are the types of things the Plan
Administrator needs to hear about after a drill. That way, they can be addressed before a real
emergency.

1.E.1.c

RTD Emergency Operations Plan
The engineering division is responsible for planning and engineering the extension, modification,
and major repairs of the RTD transit system. This division plans, and designs, improvements for
bridges, Park-n-Rides, Roadways, and Track work. Professional staff with special capabilities
contribute towards these efforts including: Architecture, Landscape, Urban Design, Civil,
Drainage, Lighting, Roadway, Structural, and Utilities.

Facilities
The facilities division is responsible for inspection and maintenance for all RTD operated
buildings. Specifically, the division is responsible for maintaining systems ranging from HVAC,
Fire, Electrical, and Plumbing. In addition to maintenance efforts, this division is also involved
with Bike Amenity Improvements, Energy Retrofits, Painting, Furniture Repairs, Electrical
Upgrades, and Tenant Finish Improvements.

Rail Systems Engineering
The designing of system elements range from the overhead catenary poles and wire, traction
power stations, to communications and relay houses. Systems engineering is outsourced
with one project manager overseeing the contract. There is limited technical expertise
in-house in this area.

Real Property
The real property division is primarily responsible for acquisition and disposition
of all RTD properties. The division regularly interacts with the general public to manage the use
of RTD properties. In addition, this division works in conjunction with the engineering division
in providing inspection and permits for construction of private and public development projects
with the use of RTD’s right-of-way.

Mapping and Engineering Data
This division is responsible for surveying and mapping, responding to Utility Notification Center
for Colorado utility locate requests, reviewing and approving utility crossing designs, and
maintaining engineering information and mapping. This division maintains the Geographic
Information System (GIS) related to properties and utilities.

Engineering Programs
This division works on FasTracks projects, and major initiatives such as the Facilities and Fleet
Transition Plan.

Quality Assurance
This division works on various quality assurance, audit, and material testing activities.

Concept of Operations
Capital Programs shall participate in the larger ICS and will send qualified representatives to
the EOC upon request of the EOC Manager. Facilities Supervisors shall be trained as Incident
Commanders and will have the authority to make decisions on the scene of an emergency.

Incidents could occur during duty and/or non-duty hours. The ability and timeliness to execute
the Capital Programs operating procedures is contingent upon factors associated with
occurrence of the events. In most cases, it is likely there will be a warning of at least a few
hours prior to an incident. Under these circumstances, the process of the activation will be more
planned including complete and orderly alert and notifications. The activation for the incidents
occurring with little to no warning and during duty hours is less routine and potentially more
difficult.

coordinate the planning of all Capital Programs operations related to emergency operations.
Capital Programs department also is committed to testing and continuous improvement of this
plan and will conduct exercises on a consistent basis, unless a real-world event or emergency
makes doing so unrealistic. After each exercise or emergency, Capital Programs department will
participate in the After Action Review process and will implement improvement plan items as
relevant.

Annex F: Transit Police and
Emergency Management Department
Purpose

The purpose of this Annex is to define the actions and roles necessary for the RTD Transit
Police and Emergency Management Department to participate in a coordinated response within
the framework of the RTD Emergency Operations Plan. This Annex provides guidance to groups
within the Transit Police and Emergency Management Department with a general concept of
potential emergency assignments before, during, and following emergency or disaster
situations.
RTD Transit Police and Emergency Management Department division is responsible for Security,
Traffic Control, Arrests, First Aid-First Responders, Shelter Needs, Transportation Issues, Crime
Issues and Investigate any criminal matters.
Included in the Transit Police and Emergency Management Department is Emergency
Management, Video Investigations, Dispatch, Integrated Security and Technology Department,
and the RTD Transit Police Patrol Division.

Scope
The RTD Transit Police and Emergency Management Department will respond to an emergency
with appropriate resources from each of its divisions for emergencies to include a civil
disturbance, mass arrest, Law Enforcement related emergency event, a natural disaster and any
other emergency which would benefit from the use of a EOC activation. The RTD Transit Police
and Emergency Management Department will utilize all its resources to include mutual aid from
other police departments in the Denver Metro area.

Situation Overview
Characteristics
The RTD Transit Police and Emergency Management Department is located at 1900 31St Street,
Denver, Colorado 80216, which is the main headquarters of the RTD Transit Police and
Emergency Management Department. At this location there are marked and unmarked patrol
vehicles, radios, less lethal weapons to include less lethal shotguns, Tasers and all computers
and laptops. The department also has two explosive detection dogs which roam the system to
identify any potential explosive materials, as well as respond to calls where explosives or
firearms crimes may be involved. All police personnel start shifts at this location, which includes
officers, corporals, sergeants, lieutenants, commanders, deputy chiefs and chief. The roles and
responsibilities of the RTD Transit Police are to:
x Enforce state law
x Conduct criminal investigations
x File reports
x Administer first aid
x Hold perimeters
x Make arrests

x Assist the emergency operations center with any police matter
The police department may also utilize security personnel and officers from other departments
(Mutual Aid).

Included at this location is Video Investigations which utilizes surveillance cameras to view any
situation on RTD property. Video Investigations also utilizes computers and cell phones. The
roles and responsibilities of video investigations is to conduct video surveillance, conduct video
investigations and to complete reports on the investigations.
Emergency Management is also included at this location who utilizes computers, cell phones,
policies, and plans for emergency situations. The roles and responsibilities of emergency
management are to respond to and coordinate during emergency events, maintain emergency
plans, develop and serve as the EOC manager during activations of the emergency operations
center, and organize and conduct emergency preparedness training, exercises, and drills.
Transit Police Communications (TPC) has two locations. The District 1 dispatch center is
located at 1205 W 7th Avenue, Denver, Colorado 80204. The District 2 dispatch center is located
at 701 W 48th Avenue, Denver, Colorado 80216. The roles and responsibilities are to:
x Manage public safety related communications, including, but not limited to receiving
emergency and non-emergency safety and security-related phone calls and electronic
communications from the public
x Track and dispatch RTD police and security assets to emergency and non-emergency
incidents
x Request and coordinate assistance from outside agencies, including law enforcement,
fire, medical, and other first responders, and serving as the point of contact for these
agencies
x Maintain accurate records of reported incidents and incident responses
x Maintain awareness of officer location, activity and safety
x Make public safety related notifications to internal and external stakeholders
x Monitor district-wide CCTV systems for illegal or dangerous activities
x Set perimeters
x Monitor weather
x Managing calls for service
Also at the 1205 W 7th Ave location is the Integrated Security and Technology Department
which monitor and maintains functionality for all RTD properties’ security technology and video
surveillance.

Planning Assumptions

All hazards that utilize an EOC, shall provide a strategic response by all members and assigns
specific responsibilities in the event a plan is activated. The plan is based on the concept that
emergency response functions will generally parallel the normal operations of all RTD
departments and divisions. To the extent possible, the same employees will be utilized in both
cases. Those day-to-day functions which would not contribute to emergency operations may be
suspended for the duration of the emergency and recovery period. Resources not normally
required for a day-to-day operation may be redirected to accomplish emergency tasks.

Annex G: Winter Weather Annex
Purpose
The purpose of the Winter Weather Annex is to identify those planning considerations specific
to Winter Weather and the planning considerations to effectively manage events. Winter
Weather includes snow storms, blowing snow, blizzards (snow storms with wind speeds above
35 mph), ice storms, sleet, freezing rain, and extreme cold. Elements of this plan may also be
useful for hail events.

Situation Overview
The Denver Metropolitan area sees average first freeze dates in September-October with final
freeze dates falling in April-May. This means that the Agency is exposed to the potential for
winter weather events for about 8 months of the year.
Geographic Risk
All of the service area is exposed to winter weather risk, areas with increased elevation will be
exposed to lower temperatures and higher precipitation totals. Where Denver sees an average
seasonal snowfall of 56.9”, Evergreen and Nederland saw 113” and 194” inches of snowfall in
the 2020-2021 season respectively. These are two municipalities served by bus service and
whose routes are subject to chain law and may need to apply them upon requirement by
CDOT.
Potential Impacts
Impacts of Winter Weather can range in severity:
x Reduced Visibility
x Slick pavement on roads, sidewalks, and at stations
x Increased Travel Times
x Delays in scheduled headways and arrival times
x Decrease in available staffing
x Ice in rail switches or building up around overhead catenary systems
x Damage to permanent infrastructure
x Buses becoming stuck in snow/ice/slush and requiring retrieval
x Vehicular accidents with privately-owned vehicles
x Power Failure at fixed facilities or to power stations along rail alignment
These impacts may culminate to trigger a system-wide service suspension. A decision to
suspend service may only be made by the General Manager/CEO or their designee.
Mitigations in Place
Mitigations are currently taken at the operational level and are described below:

Maintenance of protective equipment to mitigate impacts of winter weather

Planning Assumptions
x
x
x
x

Typically advance notice is available for winter weather events. When advance
notice is available, planning will begin when predictions indicate significant
impacts.
This advance notice will also be communicated via Situational Awareness Update,
published by Emergency Management before event initiation and updated
periodically as needed.
Supplies for winter weather response will be procured seasonally in anticipation
of winter weather events. Maintenance on specialized equipment shall also be
conducted seasonally to remain in a state of readiness
It is not typically the responsibility of RTD to perform snow removal on
municipal, state, and federal roads. This is done by the local authorities and
supported by RTD on an agreement basis

Concept of Operations
Detection/Monitoring
Winter Weather events will be monitored by Emergency Management via updates provided by
the National Weather Service and CDOT. When greater than 3” of snow are forecasted OR a
watch or warning has been declared, this information will be shared with the RTD workforce at
large.
Response Considerations
Because Winter Weather is typical in RTD’s Service Area, response will be managed by the
operational groups responsible for their execution. These actions are outlined in several
publications produced annually:

For those events which overwhelm the ability of normal operations to maintain safe operating
conditions, the Emergency Operations Center will be activated to monitor and support
operations. Upon activation, the EOC Manager will supply regular updates to the General
Manager/CEO to support their situational awareness and decision making.
Suspension of Service is the final measure taken to address unsafe conditions related to winter
weather events. This decision is not taken lightly and must be made with adequate
consideration to factors such as:
x Safety of RTD staff and customers—Is it safe to continue providing service?
x Weather Conditions and forecast—What is the character of precipitation? Are
conditions worsening? Will there be some stall in precipitation/storm conditions
which will provide an opportunity to change tactic?

Staffing availability— Communication centers, groups with winter weather impact
response responsibilities, and the availability for relief to transport themselves to
their work reporting location
Rate of revenue service vehicles becoming stuck or stalled— Can support
functions recover vehicles more quickly than they are becoming stuck?

Recovery Considerations
Service Restoration post-suspension will also be decided upon by the General Manager/CEO and
will generally be communicated to the public in advance. This ideally would take place at the
start of the next service day.
The impacts of a severe winter weather event may take over a week to fully address. This
includes snow removal, de-icing, and damage assessment. These activities may need to be
conducted iteratively.

Annex H: Flood Annex
Purpose
The purpose of the Flood Annex is to identify those planning considerations specific to flooding
events and the planning considerations to effectively manage events. Flooding is defined as any
overflow of water onto normally dry land. Flash flooding is also possible which is flooding that
occurs with little or no warning.

Situation Overview

Flooding is the most common disaster cause across the United States. Flooding can originate
from coastal flooding, riverine flooding, or excess precipitation; coastal flooding is not a concern
within RTD’s service area and instead is generally replaced by annual snowmelt hazards from
the mountains which will result in riverine flooding.
Geographic Risk
FEMA publishes Flood Maps identifying areas with 1% annual chance of flooding and 0.02%
annual chance of flooding, also known as 100 year floodplain and 500 year floodplain
respectively. RTD has rail and bus routes that traverse both types of floodplains as can be seen
in Figure 1.

While flooding is generally predictable, human intervention and water management
infrastructure can fail and cause flooding in places that are outside of the floodplain.
Potential Impacts
Impacts of flooding can range in severity:
x Bus detours to avoid flooded areas, resulting in increased travel times
x Flooded rail alignments, with potential to cause damage to infrastructure
x Water can potentially short circuit rail, causing gates to malfunction, impacting
service and causing a need for manual flagging at intersections or switches
x Decrease in available staffing
x Vehicles becoming stuck in flooded areas or before traversing flooded areas
x Damage to vehicle components, with possibility to cause arc-flash on LRV. This
can cause the LRV to become disabled on tracks
x Vehicular accidents with privately-owned vehicles
x Requests to support evacuation or emergency responders
x Increased traffic due to evacuation from affected areas
Mitigations in Place
Mitigations against the impacts of flooding are in place at several levels.

Facilities must be built outside of the 100 year floodplain. When a location is
selected that is within the floodplain, physical mitigations will be added to the
building design such as elevating the foundation’s footprint
Drainage maintenance for facilities and stations, including participation in
inspections from local jurisdictions to ensure proper compliance with local
ordinances
Pumps are included as part of design in elevator pits whereby there is an
increased flood risk

Bus Operations

Flood avoidance training, including when to stop the bus and not traverse
through a flooded area. Bus Operators are trained that conventional buses can
traverse approximately 1 foot depth of water.
Repair to flooded engines to ensure proper functioning

Rail Operations

x
x

Training to avoid flooded areas, LRV operators are trained that the LRV can
traverse though up to 3 inches of water above the railhead while CRV conductors
are trained that the CRV can traverse through 2 inches of water above the
railhead. Generally operators should not traverse through water if the railhead is
not visible
Repair to flooded LRV’s
Elevated rail on ballast to prevent standing water on rail. Most of the rail system
is built this way, with embedded rail in downtown areas being the exception

Planning Assumptions
x

Advance warning is not always available for flooding events, especially flash
flooding

x

When Flood Watches or Warnings are declared this information will be shared via
situational awareness update. Planning will begin when predictions indicate
significant impacts

x

It is not typically the responsibility of RTD to clear debris resulting from flooding
off of RTD property

x

Flooding may displace individuals who require evacuation. RTD will collaborate
with local jurisdictions on a case-by-case basis according to resource availability

x

Because flood events can escalate quickly, it is important to maintain diligent
monitoring and to be proactive with making decisions to evacuate assets from
areas that may become impacted by flooding, especially due to the staff
credentialing requirements to safely move buses and rail vehicles

National Weather Service and Colorado Department of Transportation. When a watch or
warning has been declared, this information will be shared with the RTD workforce at large.
Response Considerations
Not all flooding events have significant impact to RTD and can be managed by the
communications centers and street or field supervision staff. For those events which overwhelm
the ability of normal operations to maintain safe operating conditions, the Emergency
Operations Center will be activated to monitor and support operations. Upon activation, the
EOC Manager will provide regular updates to the General Manager/CEO to support their
situational awareness and decision making.
Detours and cancellation of certain routes may need to be implemented, though full system
service suspension is unlikely.
Recovery Considerations
The impacts of a flooding event may take over a week to fully address. This includes debris
removal, drainage restoration, and damage assessment. These activities may need to be
conducted iteratively.
If significant fleet impacts occurred, maintenance and restoration could cause service
restrictions that would last until a normal operating fleet was restored. This could take weeks or
months to fully restore.

Annex I: Wildfire Annex
Purpose
The purpose of the Wildfire Annex is to identify those planning considerations specific
to wildland fire events and the planning considerations to effectively manage events. A
wildfire is an unplanned, wildland fire and can be caused by human-caused fires,
escaped wildland fire use events, escaped prescribed fire projects, and natural causes
such as lighting strikes. For the RTD service area, interface fires that abut the
wildland/urban boundary are more likely to have significant impacts. High wind speeds
can also impact the direction or speed of wildfire spread.
Situation Overview
Wildfire one of the top hazards at the state level, triggering the majority of Colorado
emergency declarations, though the majority of these are not in areas served by RTD.
This is not the case for the costliest emergency declaration in the state’s history relative
to structure damage, The Marshall Fire in Boulder County of 2021. RTD provided some
assistance for the recovery efforts relating to this fire.
Geographic Risk

Areas with significant vegetation are at most risk for wildland fires. This generally
concentrates the geographic risk to wildland fire within the western and southern parts
of the service area, especially Boulder, Jefferson, and parts of Arapahoe and Douglas
counties. The Colorado State Forest Service maintains an interactive Wildfire Risk
Viewer on their website. Figures 1 and 2 are snapshots of the risk to both wildland fire
in general, and the Wildland Urban Interface Risk for the RTD service area.

Potential Impacts

Impacts of wildfire can range in severity:
x
x
x
x
x

x
x
x
x

Bus detours to avoid evacuated areas, resulting in increased travel times
Decrease in available staffing
Damage to vehicle or vehicle components
Vehicular accidents with privately-owned vehicles
Long-term road closures requiring detours or route suspension, including bus
bridging on detour for rail suspension
Increased traffic due to evacuation from affected areas
Power failure caused by damaged power delivery infrastructure
Requests to support evacuation or emergency responders
Buildings, facilities, landscape, and irrigation damaged by heat, fire, or smoke

Mitigations in Place

Mitigations against the impacts of wildfire are in place at several levels.
x

Practice fire drills for facilities and maintenance shops to allow for safe
evacuation of buildings

Capital Programs

properties, either with in-house staff or through contract
Remove and deter encampments of people experiencing houselessness on RTD
owned properties, in partnership with law enforcement personnel

MOW for LR and MOW & I for CR

Planning Assumptions
x
x
x
x

x

Advance warning is not always available for wildfire events
When fires are observed or under management in the service area this
information will be shared via situational awareness update. Planning will begin
when predictions indicate significant impacts
Wildfire may displace individuals who require evacuation. RTD will collaborate
with local jurisdictions on a case-by-case basis according to resource availability
Smoke inhalation is one of the risks presented by wildfire. While air quality
monitoring has become routine for Colorado in recent years, the risk escalates
the closer an individual or community is to the fire. This risk will be taken into
consideration when planning detours or for additional assistance provided by the
agency to maintain operator and customer safety
While other events may create conditions that are appropriate to respond to
during the event, wildfires frequently require a full evacuation of the impacted
area until the fire can be controlled. This may prevent mid event maintenance,
repair, or damage assessment until the area is cleared by fire professionals

x

Because wildfire events can escalate quickly, it is important to maintain diligent
monitoring and to be proactive with making decisions to evacuate assets from
areas that may become impacted by wildfire, especially due to the staff
credentialing requirements to safely move buses and rail vehicles

Concept of Operations
Detection/Monitoring

Wildfire events will be monitored by Emergency Management via updates provided by
the National Weather Service, Colorado Department of Transportation, and Colorado
Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management. Though elevated risk
levels will not generally be communicated, upon notification of a named fire being
managed, this information will be shared through a Situational Awareness Update.
Response Considerations

Not all wildfire events have significant impact on or to RTD and can be managed by the
communications centers and street or field supervision staff. For those events which
overwhelm the ability of normal operations to maintain safe operating conditions, the
Emergency Operations Center will be activated to monitor and support operations. Upon
activation, the EOC Manager will provide regular updates to the General Manager/CEO
to support their situational awareness and decision making.
Detours and cancellation of certain routes may need to be implemented, though full
system service suspension is unlikely. If the fire is not affecting a rail alignment directly,
the operators and engineers may be instructed to turn off their ventilation systems
momentarily to prevent smoke entering the cab but to continue to serve the route.
Recovery Considerations

The impacts of a wildfire event may take a long time to fully address. This includes
debris removal, damage assessment, and possibly reconstruction. These activities may
need to be conducted iteratively.
If significant fleet impacts occurred, maintenance and restoration could cause service
restrictions that would last until a normal operating fleet was restored. This could take
weeks or months to fully restore.

Annex J: Active Assailant Annex
Purpose
The purpose of the Active Assailant Annex is to identify those planning considerations
specific to risks and impacts from an Active Assailant and the planning considerations to
effectively manage events. The FBI definition of an Active Assailant is “an individual
engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in a populated area.” They go on further
to specify that firearms are the most common weapon used, but others are also
possible, including knives, clubs, explosives, or any other implement used with the
intention of harming others.
Situation Overview
Active Assailant events are becoming more common across the US, with a 57%
increase in average incidents per year from 2000-2010 and a 53% increase from 20102020 to 2021-2022. The highest casualties from active assailant events are at
businesses open to the public, which also is the location with the second highest
fatalities behind open spaces, which are public or private properties openly accessible to
the public. Except for maintenance facilities, RTD properties mostly fall within these two
categories. Due to the increasing nature of active assailant events, it is important to
plan, train, and exercise for active assailant.
Geographic Risk

Risk from an active assailant event is not defined geographically but rather follows
trends of the locations that tend to be targeted. Some features which raise the risk of a
location being targeted by an active assailant include:
x
x

High volume of population, especially populations who are perceived as being
‘easy’ targets
Low security measures, including access controls, identification measures,
surveillance, presence of security or sworn officers

Potential Impacts

Impacts of active assailant events can range in severity, these are generally ranked
from lowest to highest severity:
x
x

x

Requests to support evacuation or emergency responders
Damage to buildings, facilities, and vehicles
Damage to reputation

Transit Police Communications will be the primary communication entity
providing direction to Operations when informed of an active assailant event
All employees are asked to provide information when asked about active
assailant events, including suspect information, weapon, hostages, etc. and to
cooperate with communication centers and law enforcement in any investigation
into criminal activity
At no point should anyone not visibly identified as a police officer handle a
suspect’s weapon, even to secure it. This will create a risk of being confused for
a perpetrator
If a facility is unavailable for use due to an ongoing event or designation as a
crime scene, employees are expected to follow the Continuity of Operations Plan
for relocation or change to the nature of their work

1.E.1.c

RTD Emergency Operations Plan
Detection/Monitoring

RTD-PD and Emergency Management are in communication with partner law
enforcement agencies, including the Colorado Information Analysis Center (CIAC) who
are actively monitoring social media, internet/darkweb sources, and other sources to
identify individuals or groups that may be planning violent or destructive actions. If a
threat is identified, Police and Emergency Management staff will communicate with their
chain of command and create a communication plan to include all relevant parties. Due
to the nature of active assailant events, information about potential threats is not public
information and must be handled with all due care and consideration.
Response Considerations

The response efforts for active assailant events are typically not long-lived in nature,
with most active shooter events lasting no more than 5 minutes, which is normally
constrained by the time for first responders to arrive. Short-term recovery efforts are
generally much longer lasting with patient reunification and survivor support lasting
days or weeks.
Not all active assailant events have significant impact to RTD and can be managed by
the communications centers and street or field supervision staff, especially those events
occurring near but not on agency property. For those events which overwhelm the
ability of normal operations to maintain safe operating conditions, the Emergency
Operations Center will be activated to monitor and support operations. Upon activation,
the EOC Manager will supply regular updates to the General Manager/CEO to support
their situational awareness and decision making.
In general, the guidance for individuals who find themselves in an active assailant
incident is to follow the “Run, Hide, Fight” guidance. This enhances the lockdown
procedures that many organizations had adopted and places agency with the individual
to decide the most effective course of action in the moment and with their skillset.
‘Run’ refers to evacuating away from the assailant. Once an individual is in a safe
location, they should notify authorities of the event and provide any information they
have about weaponry, suspect, or hostages.
‘Hide’ is preferential if evacuation is not an option. There are strategies one can learn to
barricade a room more effectively, which may deter the assailant from spending time to
gain entry. Once an individual has barricaded themselves into a room, do not open the
door for anyone but police and if possible, confirm with 911 dispatch that it is police
outside the door. When active assailant incidents occur, one should try to hide behind
cover which could prevent projectiles passing through.
‘Fight’ is a last resort and should only be used if an individual is confident that they will
be able to react effectively to the assailant. This may be more effective with groups
deciding together to fight, but injuries should be expected. Some people will not feel

1.E.1.c

empowered to fight, and it is their right to decide which of the actions to take, based
upon their judgement.
“Run, Hide, Fight” actions may need to be modified for individuals employed by RTD
based upon their position and the activity for which they are currently engaged. The
primary objective of a Light Rail operator/Commuter Rail engineer is to stop the vehicle
and provide a PA announcement for customers to evacuate. The conductor on a moving
commuter rail trains will also direct customers to evacuate to a different car, away from
the assailant. Communication with OCC/Control should always be maintained.
On buses, operators are individually responsible for the security and safety of their
vehicles and customers. Bus operators are empowered to use their own discretion to
protect themselves and customers. The judgement of the operator in the immediate
circumstances of the attack will be critical and the decision to act in each unique
situation ultimately falls to the operator. No agency policy can or should dictate an
operator’s response. This can include making decisions about the next safest location to
stop the vehicle and evacuating customers.
Detours and cancellation of certain routes may need to be implemented. If intelligence
information indicates that a threat has not been resolved or that multiple actors may be
targeting the agency and its modes of transportation, then a full-service suspension
may be requested by local law enforcement agencies. This decision can be made by the
communication centers or Transit Police. All due effort will be made to inform the
General Manager/CEO, though the time sensitive nature of these events may preclude
such an effort.
Recovery Considerations

RTD is not well-equipped to address the needs of patient reunification and survivor
support and will partner with local jurisdictions in these short term recovery efforts. This
partnership will include information sharing, staffing any EOC or JIC that may be stood
up, or personnel support needs.
Service restoration will occur when law enforcement officials have given indication that
it is safe for operators to resume service. This may include detours to avoid sites of
investigation or other security concerns. This will be communicated with the public
through all available channels.
The impacts of an active assailant event may take a long time to fully address. This
includes debris removal, damage assessment, and possibly reconstruction. These
activities may need to be conducted iteratively.

3. RESPONSIBILITIES
Department Senior Managersџ Senior managers within the affected departments are engaged
to allocate resources from that department to act as the Cybersecurity Incident Response Team
(CIRT) and assist with operations-based decision making.
Cybersecurity Incident Response Teamџ The CIRT is a designated group of system, network,
and application administrators and other supporting stakeholders trained to respond to
cybersecurity incidents. The CIRT may be expanded to include additional members as necessary
to address the incident. The CIRT Lead is responsible for leading the Incident Response
Procedure and the CIRT Team is responsible for executing it. Refer to the CIRT Escalation list
for a list of members on the CIRT Team: CIRT Contact and Escalation
CIRT Leadџ The CIRT Lead is the Incident Commander, who directs the efforts of the CIRT
when responding to a cybersecurity incident. The CIRT Lead has the primary authority in
response decisions for RTD cybersecurity incidents. This is a functional role; the CIRT Lead is
always a member of the CIRT, however, the specific person assuming the role of CIRT Lead
may vary depending on the nature and scope of the incident.
Cybersecurity Operations Centerџ The Cybersecurity Operations Center (CSOC) is responsible
for the monitoring, detection, and initial analysis of RTD cybersecurity events. CSOC analysts
intake and categorize user and Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP) reported incidents

and issues and perform classification and/or coordination, analysis, and recovery activities. The
CSOC is an extension of RTD’s internal Cybersecurity Team.
IT Service Deskџ The IT Service Desk is the initial intake point for reports of incidents or
suspicious activity, creates tracking tickets, and engages the CIRT members that are needed to
respond to an incident. For complex incidents, the IT Service Desk additionally helps coordinate
communications among the CIRT members.
Business Process Ownerџ The business process owner is the lead or manager of the primary
business process that is impacted by the incident. The business process owner typically controls
the day-to-day access to, business use of, and appropriate operation of a computerized
business system. The business process owner provides support to the CIRT by providing
information and coordinating access and outages. The business process owner is also
responsible for understanding and addressing any legal, contractual, or regulatory incident
reporting requirements (e.g., data breach requirements) that are relevant to the system or the
type of data it contains.

Supporting Stakeholders
The following groups may provide support to the CIRT based on the context and nature of the
incident.

x

System Administrators: System administrators are technical experts with
specialized skills and intimate knowledge of RTD technology. Enterprise system
administrators are typically members of the IT division; however, other system
administrators also exist within RTD. If applicable, system administrators coordinate
activities with vendors supporting the technology base.

x

General Counsel: Provides guidance to ensure compliance with local, state, and
federal laws, and industry regulatory requirements (Payment Card Industry Data
Security Standard (PCI), credit card brands, etc.). Provides advice if there is reason
to believe that an incident may have legal ramifications, including evidence
collection, prosecution of a suspect, or a lawsuit. If an employee is implicated in the
incident, coordinates with Human Resources and provides advice, including
appropriate internal investigations.

x

Transit Police: Immediately notified if the CIRT determines or suspects imminent
danger to people or criminal activity. Provides oversight and assistance during
incidents involving criminal activity. Provides physical security to CIRT members as
otherwise requested.

x

Human Resources: Provides assistance if an incident directly involves an
employee or employee data (e.g., employee is the victim of the incident or is
suspected of causing the incident). This may include, but is not limited to,
assistance with disciplinary action or counseling, and employee termination.

x

Communications: Responsible for handling public relations needs (e.g., media
inquiries, press releases, or public statements). Depending on the nature and
impact of the incident, Communications may need to confer with other parties in
the incident response process (CIRT, senior management, legal, etc.) to ensure
public statements comply with constraints imposed by business, security, and law

4.1 PROCEDURE
As defined in NIST 800-61, the Computer Security Incident Handling Guide, the incident
response procedure encompasses six phases: preparation, detection, analysis, containment,
eradication, and recovery. The dynamic relationship between those phases is highlighted in the
figure below.

The integration of these steps with RTD’s Cybersecurity Incident Response Plan aids in
addressing compliance with Transit Security Administration (TSA) Security Directive 1582- 2101. Section 4 will detail the integration of these six phases for incident response at RTD.

4.1 PREPARATION

Cybersecurity Awareness Training
The Cybersecurity Incident Response policy requires all employees and contractors to
participate in annual cybersecurity awareness training. This training shall include, at minimum,
learning activities focused on recognizing and avoiding common types of end- user
cybersecurity incidents (e.g., credential theft, malware, and phishing or other social engineering
attacks). Additionally, users receive training on how to report incidents through ServiceNow.
All employees, contractors, or any agency representative with RTD email accounts shall
participate in training once per calendar year. New members will be enrolled in training within
30 days of employment start date and shall complete training within 30 days of enrollment
date.

The following resources are critical to an appropriate, timely, and well-documented response
and shall remain available in case of an incident:

x

RTD’s standard communication toolset, including the ServiceNow ticketing system
and designated rooms or bridge lines for incidents occurring on platforms such as
Microsoft Teams

x

Incident response runbooks, playbooks, wiki pages, or other standard procedures,
forms, decision trees, and checklists (as exist). These living documents are
maintained by the CIRT and are adapted based on the CIRT’s experience and
changes in industry best practices. These should be available in physical copies, on
the N drive, and in the cloud on sites such as Microsoft Teams and Microsoft
office365

x

RTD published security policies, procedures, and best practices

4.2 DETECTION AND REPORTING
4.2 Detection Method
Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP)
Tier 1 support is provided by Critical Start, RTD’s MSSP. Security events are monitored, and
alerts are triaged and investigated appropriately. Alerts that require additional investigation are
escalated to Tier 2, RTD’s Cybersecurity Operations Center.

RTD Cybersecurity Operations Center (CSOC)
Escalated alerts from the MSSP are handed off to RTD for Tier 2 support and are investigated
further. A ServiceNow ticket is opened for any alerts that require remediation. Refer to
Classification section below regarding impact and criticality. Additionally, threat hunting is
conducted across several data sets to proactively search for anomalies in the environment that
may be a threat.

Internal Staff
Cybersecurity incidents may also be reported by internal staff via ServiceNow. Technical
administrators may identify an issue with their system, for example, or end users may report a
phishing email.

4.2.1 Reporting Method
Employees, contractors, and agency representatives shall open a Service Desk ticket to report
cyber-related incidents. Employees and contractors may contact the Service Desk via:

x

Create ServiceNow ticket via Email: servicedesk@rtd-denver.com
Email the Service Desk team: servicedeskteam@rtd-denver.com
For urgent incidents, employees, contractors, and agency representatives shall additionally
notify the IT Service Desk and appropriate CIRT member (if known) by phone. If emergency
response is required to contain the threat, in addition to creating a ticket, the IT Service Desk or
CIRT member immediately notifies the business process owner to start communications and
business continuity procedures.

4.2.2 Documentation and Routing
The IT Service Desk shall ensure that each incident report is documented in an IT Service
Ticket. The IT Service Desk or CIRT may bundle multiple reports related to the same incident
into a single ticket. If the ticket contains sensitive information, the IT Service Desk shall ensure
that access to the details is limited to those with a need-to-know.

Owner/Operator to report cybersecurity incidents to the Department of
Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency
(CISA) as soon as practicable, but no later than 24 hours after a
cybersecurity incident is identified

Reporting Cybersecurity Incidents:
1

RTD must report cybersecurity incidents to CISA involving systems that the
Owner/Operator has responsibility to operate and/or maintain, including:
a.
b.
c.
d.

2

Unauthorized access of an Information or Operational Technology system
Discovery of malicious software on an IT or OT system
Activity resulting in a denial of service to any IT or OT system
Any other cybersecurity incident that results in operational disruption to
the Owner/Operators Information or Operational Technology systems or
other aspects of the Owner/Operator’s rail systems or facilities, or an
incident that has the potential to cause impact to a large number of
passengers, critical infrastructure or core government functions, or
impacts national security, economic security, or public health and safety

Cybersecurity incidents reported to CISA will be conveyed through the CISA
Incident Reporting System at the following link: https://uscert.cisa.gov/forms/report. To assist with filling out this form, utilize the RTD
CISA Incident Reporting template, which outlines the required fields and
serves as a local RTD record of the Cyber incident submitted to CISA.

Containment
Containment is maintaining control of the affected system(s) and surrounding environment and
preventing an incident from causing further damage. It may be technical (e.g., removing the
affected system from the network) or non-technical (e.g., working with supporting stakeholders
and the business process owner to identify strategies to manage customer impacts).
If an intruder’s actions are rapid, destructive, and/or spreading, the CIRT Lead shall authorize
the CIRT’s immediate action to contain the threat, including actions that could be disruptive to
business operations or public service. Examples may include:
x
x
x
x

Disconnecting IT networks impacting fare collections and business operations
Shutting down servers disrupting rail operations
Isolating systems supporting paratransit operations
Restricting networks impacting critical back office and administrative functions

General Guidance for Containment Governance
Any containment actions that will significantly disrupt RTD’s operations or ability to achieve its
strategic priorities, shall require prior approval by the General Manager and CEO.
For other less disruptive containment directives, the CIRT Lead shall seek prior approval from
affected Chiefs or Assistant General Managers (AGM), but if they are unavailable after best
effort attempts, these actions do not require process owner or leadership approval.
After containment actions are performed, the CIRT will stand-up a Communications Call Bridge
to provide real-time updates to RTD’s Leadership Team and affected stakeholders. A
notification with call-in information will be sent to the business stakeholders and leadership
within 15 minutes of containment directives being issued.
Specific requirements for the approval of containment actions will be defined in the Containment
Procedures.
4.5.1 Containment Procedures
To facilitate timely containment of cybersecurity attacks, each of the following containment
procedures should be documented and annually reviewed for accuracy.
Each procedure should include provisions for the designation of different approval methods
depending on the impact and scope of the incident, if applicable.
Each procedure will need to be signed and approved by the associated department’s Chief or
AGM.

Recovery
Recovery involves testing and restoring the systems to
vulnerabilities to prevent similar incidents (e.g., restoring systems from clean backups,
rebuilding systems from scratch, replacing compromised files with clean versions, installing
patches, changing passwords, tightening network security, increasing logging and monitoring
levels).
To ensure the integrity and security of backed-up data and systems, the following measures
must be considered and implemented where technically feasible:

x

Backups should be secured and maintained offline

x

Procedures are documented so that when data backups are made, they are scanned by
security software to check that it is free of malicious artifacts

x

Procedures are documented so that when backups are tested for restoration, they are
scanned by security software to check that it is free of malicious artifacts

Incident Closure
This step involves documenting and communicating closure of the incident to all involved
stakeholders.
4.6 POST-INCIDENT REVIEW
Following a major incident, the CIRT Lead schedules a meeting with the CIRT and any other
individuals who participated in the incident response to discuss the following:
Root Cause Detail
The root cause of the incident should be identified and detailed, including the technical and nontechnical causes of the incident using a standard methodology.
Lessons Learned
Identify what went well during the incident response, so that those procedures or techniques
can be repeated, and areas for improvement, so those procedures can be revised or additional
support can be obtained. A post-incident report (PIR) shall be completed at this time. To
facilitate the PIR, collect the following information:
x

A timeline of activities taken by RTD from when the incident was discovered, to
recovery

x

Were documented procedures followed? Why or why not?

6 Ransomware Specific Response Guidelines
Section 6 serves as a CIRT reference for responding to ransomware attacks.

6.1 Ransomware Detection and Analysis
1. Determine which systems were impacted, and immediately isolate them.

1.E.1.c

x

If several systems or subnets appear impacted, take the network offline at the switch
level. It may not be feasible to disconnect individual systems during an incident.

x

If taking the network temporarily offline is not immediately possible, locate the
network (e.g., Ethernet) cable and unplug affected devices from the network or
remove them from Wi-Fi to contain the infection.

x

After an initial compromise, malicious actors may monitor an organization’s activity
or communications to understand if their actions have been detected. Be sure to
isolate systems in a coordinated manner and use out-of-band communication
methods like phone calls or other means to avoid tipping off actors that they have
been discovered and that mitigation actions are being undertaken. Not doing so
could cause actors to move laterally to preserve their access—already a common
tactic—or deploy ransomware widely prior to networks being taken offline.
Note: Step 2, which follows, will prevent from maintaining ransomware infection artifacts
and potential evidence stored in volatile memory. It should be carried out only if it is not
possible to temporarily shut down the network or disconnect affected hosts from the
network using other means.

2. Only in the event devices cannot be disconnected from the network, power them
down to avoid further spread of the ransomware infection.
Containment actions should prioritize RTD’s most critical assets. Should initial containment
fail, consider asset and business service prioritization when performing disruptive proactive
actions, as follows:

a) Disconnect Windows domain controllers
b) Disconnect network backups
c) Disconnect firewall and network connections into commuter rail
d) Disconnect firewall and network connections into light rail
e) Disconnect Ticket Vending Machines (TVM) and supporting VPN connections
f) Disconnect core switches isolating user and data center environments
g) Disconnect internet connections
3. Triage impacted systems for restoration and recovery.
x

Identify and prioritize critical systems for restoration and confirm the nature of
data housed on impacted systems.

x

Prioritize restoration and recovery based on a predefined critical asset list that
includes information systems critical for health and safety, revenue generation,
or other critical services, as well as systems they depend on.

x

Keep track of systems and devices that are not perceived to be impacted so they
can be deprioritized for restoration and recovery. This enables the organization

4. Confer with the team to develop and document an initial understanding of what has
occurred based on initial analysis.
5. Using the contact information below, engage internal and external teams and
stakeholders with an understanding of what they can provide to help mitigate,
respond to, and recover from the incident.
x

Share the information on hand to receive the most timely and relevant
assistance. Keep the leadership team and senior managers informed via regular
updates as the situation develops. Relevant stakeholders may include the IT
department, managed security service providers, the cyber insurance company,
and departmental or elected leaders.

x

Consider requesting assistance from CISA; MS-ISAC; and local, state, or federal
law enforcement (e.g., Federal Bureau of Investigation [FBI] and U.S. Secret
Service [USSS]).

x

As appropriate, coordinate with communications and public relations personnel
to ensure that accurate information is shared internally with the organization
and externally with the public.

x

The Public Power Cyber Incident Response Playbook
(https://www.publicpower.org/system/files/documents/Public-Power-CyberIncident-Response-Playbook.pdf) contains guidance for organizational
communication procedures as well as templates for cyber incident holding
statements for public consumption. Work with the team to develop similar
procedures and draft holding statements as soon as possible, as developing this
documentation during an incident is not optimal. This will allow the organization
to reach consensus, in advance, on what level of detail is appropriate to share
within the organization and with the public, and how information will flow.
Ransomware Containment and Eradication

If no initial mitigation actions appear possible:
1. Take a system image and memory capture of a sample of affected devices (e.g.,
workstations and servers). Additionally, collect any relevant logs as well as samples
of any “precursor” malware binaries and associated observables or indicators of
compromise (e.g., suspected command and control IP addresses, suspicious registry
entries, or other relevant files detected).
x

Take care to preserve evidence that is highly volatile in nature—or limited in
retention—to prevent loss or tampering (e.g., system memory, Windows
Security logs, data in firewall log buffers).

to get back to business in a more efficient manner.

148
Packet Pg. 461

1.E.1.c

2. Consult federal law enforcement regarding possible decryptors available, as security
researchers have already broken the encryption algorithms for some ransomware
variants.

To continue taking steps to contain and mitigate the incident:
1. Research the trusted guidance (i.e., published by sources such as government, MSISAC, reputable security vendor) for the particular ransomware variant and follow
any additional recommended steps to identify and contain systems or networks that
are confirmed to be impacted.
x

Kill or disable the execution of known ransomware binaries; this will minimize
damage and impact to systems. Delete other known, associated registry values
and files.

2. Identify the systems and accounts involved in the initial breach. These can include
email accounts.
3. Based on the breach or compromise details determined above, contain any
associated systems that may be used for further or continued unauthorized access.
Breaches often involve mass credential exfiltration. Securing the network and other
information sources from continued credential-based unauthorized access may
require the following actions:
x

Disabling virtual private networks, remote access servers, single sign-on
resources, and cloud-based or other public facing assets.

4. If server-side data is being encrypted by an infected workstation, quick-identification
steps are to:
x Review Computer Management > Sessions and Open Files lists on associated
servers to determine the user or system accessing those files.
x Review file properties of encrypted files or ransom notes to identify specific
users that may be associated with file ownership.
x Review the TerminalServices-RemoteConnectionManager event log to check for
successful RDP network connections.
x Review the Windows Security log, SMB event logs, and any related logs that
may identify significant authentication or access events.
5. Run Wireshark on the impacted server with a filter to identify IP addresses involved
in actively writing or renaming files (e.g., "smb2.filename contains cryptxxx").

6. Conduct an examination of existing organizational detection or prevention systems
(e.g., antivirus, Endpoint Detection & Response, IDS, Intrusion Prevention System)
and logs. Doing so can highlight evidence of additional systems or malware involved
in earlier stages of the attack.
x

Look for evidence of precursor “dropper” malware. A ransomware event may
be evidence of a previous, unresolved network compromise. Many ransomware
infections are the result of existing malware infections such as TrickBot, Dridex,
or Emotet.

x

Operators of these advanced malware variants will often sell access to a
network. Malicious actors will sometimes use this access to exfiltrate data and
then threaten to release the data publicly before ransoming the network in an
attempt to further extort the victim and pressure them into paying.

x

Malicious actors often drop manually deployed ransomware variants on a
network to obfuscate their post-compromise activity. Care must be taken to
identify such dropper malware before rebuilding from backups to prevent
continuing compromise.

7. Conduct extended analysis to identify outside-in and inside-out persistence
mechanisms.

Outside-in persistence may include authenticated access to external systems
via rogue accounts, backdoors on perimeter systems, exploitation of external
vulnerabilities, etc.

x

Inside-out persistence may include malware implants on the internal network
or a variety of living-off-the-land style modifications (e.g., use of commercial
penetration testing tools like Cobalt Strike; use of PsTools suite, including
PsExec, to remotely install and control malware and gather information
regarding—or perform remote management of—Windows systems; use of
PowerShell scripts). Identification may involve deployment of endpoint
detection and response solutions, audits of local and domain accounts,
examination of data found in centralized logging systems, or deeper forensic
analysis of specific systems once movement within the environment has been
mapped out.

8. Rebuild systems based on a prioritization of critical services (e.g., health and safety
or revenue generating services), using pre-configured standard images, if possible.
9. Once the environment has been fully cleaned and rebuilt (including any associated
impacted accounts and the removal or remediation of malicious persistence
mechanisms), issue password resets for all affected systems and address any
associated vulnerabilities and gaps in security or visibility. This can include applying
patches, upgrading software, and taking other security precautions not previously
taken.

6.2 Ransomware Recovery and Post-Incident Activity
1. Reconnect systems and restore data from offline, encrypted backups based on a
prioritization of critical services.
x

Take care not to re-infect clean systems during recovery. For example, if a
new Virtual Local Area Network has been created for recovery purposes,
ensure only clean systems are added to it.

2. Document lessons learned from the incident and associated response activities to
inform updates to—and refine—organizational policies, plans, and procedures, and
guide future exercises of the same.
3. Consider sharing lessons learned and relevant indicators of compromise with CISA or
the sector ISAC/ISAO for further sharing and to benefit others within the
community.

Annex L: Hazardous Materials Annex
Purpose
The purpose of the Hazardous Materials (Hazmat) Annex is to identify those planning
considerations specific to hazardous materials both at RTD Facilities and in the broader service
area. Hazardous materials are defined by the NFPA 400, Hazardous Materials Code as:

A chemical or substance that is classified as a physical hazard material or a health
hazard material, whether the chemical or substance is in usable or waste condition.

Where physical and health hazards can be any of the classifications (Table 1):

Pyrophoric
Unstable (reactive)
Water-reactive material
Source: NFPA 400, Hazardous Materials Code

Situation Overview
RTD uses/stores Hazmat in nine facilities, which are all accounted for in the annual Tier II
Emergency and Hazardous Chemical Inventory submitted in whole or part to the State
Emergency Response Commission, Denver County LEPC, Arapahoe County LEPC, Boulder
County LEPC, Denver Fire Department, Aurora Fire Rescue Department, Englewood Fire Area
Control District, and Boulder Fire-Rescue Department. Denver Fire Department also requires
additional hazmat reporting for permitting purposes.
Additionally Hazmat is transported through Denver along designated Hazardous Materials
Routes (entire portion contained in service area unless otherwise noted): I-25, I-70 from 270
East to Kansas, I-70 from I-25 West to US 6 (East of Loveland Pass), I-225, I-76, I-270, US 36

Potential Impacts
Hazardous materials spills can vary widely in severity and their impacts. Physical and health
impacts as outlined above are potential risks as well as:
x Property damage
x Service Disruption or detours
x Regulatory non-compliance
x Financial cost to remediate
x Investigation to identify cause or impacts can cause long-lasting disruption
x Reputation damage
x Injury or loss of life to RTD employees or customers
Mitigations in Place
All hazardous materials stored in RTD facilities are properly labeled and stored in appropriate
size, material, and quantity according to their state (gas, liquid or solid), concentration, and
application.
RTD facilities with petroleum products also have leak detection equipment and secondary
containment to identify and prevent spills. Regular monitoring is conducted by RTD Personnel
and a third-party contractor, including inspections, maintenance, and regulatory compliance.

Packet Pg. 471

1.E.1.c

All RTD staff responsible for handling of hazardous materials are trained on their safe handling
instructions and have Safety Data Sheets available in any workspace that has hazardous
materials. These are also communicated with local first response partners to ensure they are
able to respond safely to facilities storing hazardous materials. Fire Department partners have
also been familiarized with all RTD Facilities.
RTD has Contracted CG Environmental and Belfor Environmental to do asbestos, mold, flooding,
lead-based paint, groundwater and soil contamination, and fire damage remediation, as well as
waste disposal to prevent exposure hazards at RTD facilities.
RTD vehicles have ventilation systems in place to protect operators and customers. Buses,
including paratransit buses, have recirculating ventilation systems which can prevent air from
the outside of the bus from entering into the space when all doors and windows are closed. On
light and commuter rail vehicles, operators are able to turn off HVAC systems to prevent
external air from entering the internal operator and customer area when doors are closed.

Planning Assumptions
x Hazardous materials are stored and transported throughout the Service Area and
events impacting RTD may not originate at RTD facilities or vehicles

x

Wind and other weather conditions can increase the area impacted by a
hazardous materials incident and may be unpredictable

x

Impacts of Hazardous Materials incidents may have long-lasting
response/recovery efforts to address the event’s impacts, including the mitigation
of environmental impacts, especially to affected waterways

Concept of Operations
Detection/Monitoring
Hazardous materials incidents are the responsibility of the originating agency to report to
authorities. Air quality monitoring may be an early detection point for hazardous materials
releases not sufficiently reported. This information will be disseminated by local response/public
safety agencies.
RTD facilities with petroleum products have leak detection equipment and secondary
containment to identify and prevent spills. Regular monitoring is conducted by RTD Personnel
and a third-party contractor, including inspections, maintenance, and regulatory compliance.
Safety & Environmental staff perform regular inspections to identify any potential hazmat
hazards, among other factors.
Safety and Environmental create and disseminate training for frontline staff to identify improper
hazmat handling with reporting tools made available to encourage efficient identification of any
risky behaviors and storage methods. Industrial spill response training and other training is
available on HR management platforms, currently under the name of “Safety Skillz
(implemented in 2023).”

Response Considerations
If necessary for RTD personnel to enter an area contaminated with Hazardous Materials, they
must don the appropriate level of PPE. If the chemical identity is unknown or has mixed with
secondary chemicals, Level A PPE is required. In this case, do not approach the spill and advise
first responders upon their arrival.
First Responders and Environmental Professionals will primarily be responsible for response and
notification of when it is safe to return to an affected area.
For hazardous materials incidents originating at an RTD facility, the primary point of contact
within RTD will be Bus dispatch, 303-299-3000, and Light Rail Control at 303-299-3480, with
secondary contacts being RTD’s Environmental Compliance Manager and Environmental
Specialists. If the spill is larger or more hazardous/unsafe than what RTD is adequately able to
address independently, they will then contact one of two hazardous materials clean-up
contractors, CG Environmental or Belfor Environmental as of 2023.
Facility specific plans have been developed for six facilities containing the majority of the
agency’s hazmat: Boulder, District Shops, East Metro, Elati, Mariposa and Platte (Format name
2023 RTD ICP Facility Name). These are available on The Hub, the agency’s intranet, and
should be reviewed by all individuals responsible for response operations taking place at an RTD
facility.
Recovery Considerations
RTD Facilities impacted by a hazardous materials incident may not be accessible for days or
weeks following the incident. In this case, affected staff members located at that facility will
report to the alternate facility identified in the Continuity of Operations Plan.

Annex M: Power Failure
Purpose
The purpose of the Power Failure Annex is to identify those planning considerations
specific for the loss of power to any major RTD facility and the planning considerations
to effectively manage these events.
Situation Overview
Xcel Energy is the only power supply company within the RTD service area and
maintains all pre-RTD infrastructure related to power delivery. Occasionally, RTD will
have power loss to one or more building, or to power substations serving the rail
alignment during a power grid failure. In the past, there have been one to three major
outages on average per year affecting the agency. These outages can range in duration
from six to 36 hours.
Geographic Risk

As the entire service area is supplied with power from a single entity, no single location
has an elevated geographic risk. However, power failures can be caused by severe
weather such as extreme heat, extreme cold, snow, hail, or high winds. Power failures
can also occur due to technological or human-caused events such as excavation or
malicious actors.
Potential Impacts

Impacts of power failure can range in severity:
x Dependency on diesel generator power for facilities
x Impacts to maintenance and transportation caused by inoperable equipment,
x
x
x
x
x
x

such as not being able to fuel, inoperable lifts, power charging for electric fleet
Loss of power to access control systems
Loss of traction power for rail system
General loss of power to buildings (lights, computers, conveyances)
Lack of power to life and safety systems
Loss of Communication center (Bus, Light Rail, Commuter Rail, Transit Police,
Customer Care), including train control systems like SCADA and LRV signaling
system for light rail and Wabtec and WiMax for commuter rail
Data center failure, Network failure, Security Camera system failure, Radio
system failure

These impacts may culminate to trigger a system-wide service suspension. A decision to
suspend service may only be made by the General Manager/CEO or their designee.
Mitigations in Place

Mitigations are currently taken at the operational level and are described below:

or supporting facilities. RTD may be secondary priority to restore depending
upon the other facilities impacted
When far-reaching power failures occur, temperature controls are likely to fail in
residential settings and may result in warming/cooling centers being open. This
may cause increased traffic on RTD revenue service vehicles
Power restoration times are almost always estimates and are subject to change
Generally, loss of power to servers does not necessarily mean a loss of historic
data, the predicted data loss should be limited to the data that has not been
backed-up at the time of the power outage, typically no more than 24 hours of
loss. New data generated since the loss of power may not be stored
Many elements of ensuring continuity from a power loss are included in the
COOP. Where facilities, IT systems, or communication systems are impacted the
COOP is the most up to date record of backup procedures. This includes
prioritization of restoration from the agency-wide perspective

Concept of Operations
Detection/Monitoring

Power failures can be identified by RTD staff, systems, or through notification from Xcel
Energy. Once a power failure has been identified, facilities staff will communicate with
Xcel to gather restoration information.
Response Considerations

For those events which overwhelm the ability of normal operations to maintain safe
operating conditions, the Emergency Operations Center will be activated to monitor and
support operations. Upon activation, the EOC Manager will supply regular updates to
the General Manager/CEO to support their situational awareness and decision making.
Suspension of Service is the final measure taken to address impacts related to power
failure events. This decision is not taken lightly and must be made with adequate
consideration to factors such as:

charged batteries for radios be available?
Can vehicles be kept in a safe operational condition?
Is fuel available to keep generators and vehicles running? For how long?
Predictability for customers-Eg. Agency must provide service during PM peak
hours if AM peak hours service was conducted, ability to communicate to
customers changes being made

Recovery Considerations

Service Restoration post-suspension will also be decided upon by the General
Manager/CEO and will generally be communicated to the public in advance. This ideally
would take place at the start of the next service day.
The impacts of a complete power outage event may take some time to fully address.
This includes IT data and system restoration, inspections of equipment before clearing
for use, and repair of damage to infrastructure if surge events occurred, inclusive of
staff availability.

Annex N: Train Derailment Annex
Purpose
The purpose of the Train Derailment Annex is to identify those planning considerations specific
to a train derailment either on or off RTD alignments and the planning considerations to
effectively manage events.

Situation Overview
Rail infrastructure throughout Denver is owned and operated by RTD, DTP, and a number of
commercial freight companies. Derailments are possible on any rail alignment and could impact
RTD service delivery at rail crossings, on parallel alignments, or on RTD alignments.
Geographic Risk
Rail infrastructure in RTD’s service area is shown in Figure 2.

x

may be more likely to occur during inclement weather
Not all train derailments which affect RTD will be on RTD alignment or involving
RTD vehicles. For these events, RTD will liaise with the primary rail service
provider to gather timelines to restoration as well as resolve financial matters
related to damages and service delay
RTD will liaise with first responders but will take ownership of any event
impacting RTD property once life-saving activities have concluded

Concept of Operations
Detection/Monitoring
Derailment events will be communicated by the Communication Center which has identified the
impacts. At time of Emergency Management notification, a Situational Awareness Update will be
sent to the RTD workforce at large.
Response Considerations
Due to regulation from FRA and FTA, derailment and rerailing procedures for RTD vehicles are
maintained and reviewed regularly. An index of these policies/procedures is below:

Additionally, the Track Access Guide which serves as a crucial
supplementary resource, is designed to be utilized in conjunction with
the RWP Manual. It leverages site-speciﬁc survey data of the guideway
to provide detailed context and identify conditions requiring additional
attention when selecting outlined in the RWP Manual. When using both
the Roadway Worker Protection Manual and the Track Access Guide,
always remember that site conditions are dynamic. Atmospheric changes
(light, precipitation, temperature) and changes in ambient noise can
signiﬁcantly impact safety. Always refer to the Maximum Authorized
Speed (MAS) indicated; if uncertain, default to the higher speed to ensure
adequate time to reach a place of safety before a train arrives. The
sight distances mentioned are minimums for a 15-second warning; allow
additional time when conditions dictate or when the nature of the work
requires extra time to clear personnel, tools, or equipment to a place
of safety.

The RTD Light Rail Roadway Worker Protection (RWP) Manual is a
fundamental document required by Federal Transit Administration
(FTA) regulations, speciﬁcally 49 CFR Part 671 and Colorado Code of
Regulations 4-723-7. These regulations mandate that transit agencies
establish comprehensive safety procedures to protect personnel working
on or near rail tracks. The RWP Manual serves as the primary authority
outlining these essential rules, responsibilities (such as the Roadway
Worker In Charge), and methods of protection.

Remember: If you are uncertain about your safety, trust your instincts;
make a good faith challenge. You may be saving your life.

6. All good faith challenges will be documented.

5. If good faith challenges have merit, deﬁciencies will be corrected
and employees will resume work. If the good faith challenge has no
merit, RWP will be explained by supervisor to Roadway workers and
employees will resume work.

15

4. If the onsite supervisor cannot resolve, then the MOW manager or his
designee will be reached for resolution.

3. If the supervisor cannot resolve over the phone, the supervisor will
report to the scene and evaluate the challenge.

2. If challenge can be resolved, resume work. If the challenge cannot be
resolved, the supervisor will be contacted.

1. Roadway worker has concern about on-track safety and discusses with
Roadway Worker in Charge.

Note: All good faith challenges steps will be held outside fouling distance.

Good Faith Challenge Process

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_Exhibits_2026_v1_Redacted_v1 (5178 : 2026 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))
14 RWP MANUAL

5. RTD management should periodically review their Roadway Worker
Protection program to identify and remove any administrative or
procedural barriers to the utilization of the good faith challenge.

4. Supervisors and co-workers should actively encourage the use of the
good faith challenge.

3. Roadway workers should periodically review the good faith challenge
procedures during crew meetings/job brieﬁngs.

2. All roadway workers should know where to access RTD’s good faith
challenge procedures and understand the resolution process.

1. Employees should remain clear of track until the challenge is resolved.

Key Points:

RTD management fully supports a roadway worker’s absolute right to
initiate a good faith challenge without fear of retaliation or discipline.
The good faith challenge process begins when an employee raises an
RWP concern.

A good faith challenge is an opportunity to jointly resolve any Roadway
Worker Protection concerns; it is not a confrontation with your supervisor
or RTD management. A job brieﬁng is the ﬁrst opportunity to make a
good faith challenge; however, a challenge can be made at any time.
Challenges require prompt and fair resolution.

Summary: Purpose of a good faith challenge is straightforward: To
provide roadway workers with a non-punitive mechanism for raising and
resolving on-track safety concerns so the work can be performed safely.

Note: Trains are never allowed to bypass a red signal into the work
zone under foul time protection.

Either of the two methods listed below are acceptable to make a track
inaccessible:
1. Line and lock switches on the limits of work zone to prevent access.

4. Protection must remain in place until the track is made safe and
workers are clear.

3. force signals governing entrance(s) into the work zone to red.

2. Notify control of location of foul time and wait to receive authority
before proceeding.

1. Conduct job brieﬁng with all members of the work group.

Step by Step – Foul Time

4. Will be used in conjunction with a ﬂagman.

4. If switch is dual control, take switch off power.

3. Line switches on both ends away from the work zone and lock/point
lock switch; or, install derails with double red ﬂag protection if unable
to use switches for protection.

3. Used in interlocking’s and electric lock switch areas only.

2. Used for short periods of time only, not to exceed 10 minutes.

2. Conduct job brieﬁng with all members of the work group.

1. No Trains will be allowed in your work zone during foul time.

1. Notify Shop Supervisor at Elati or Control at Mariposa of track to be
made inaccessible.

Key Points

If in an electric switch lock area the signal maintainer will be required to
take the switch/switches out of correspondence setting outer opposing
signals (OOS) red.

19

Upon receiving permission from control, the Roadway Worker must force
signals governing entrance(s) into the work zone to red. This can be
accomplished by placing the interlocking house into Local control mode,
taking the switch(s) out of correspondence, opening gold nuts or placing
a shunt.

Step by Step – Inaccessible Track

d. An additional red ﬂag must be placed 50 feet in advance of the derail.

c. Derails must have double red ﬂags placed at the location of the derail.

b. Derails must be secured at all times. When transporting derails in
vehicles they must be chained and locked to the vehicle to prevent
theft. When installed on the rail they must be securely locked to
prevent tampering.

a. Permission must be obtained from MOW supervisor on duty.

2. Installing derail(s) with ﬂag placement.

d. If the switch lacks the ability to be locked out, then point clamp or
spike the switch point.

c. Dual control switches will be taken off power.

b. Switches on both ends need to be lined away from work zone.

Foul Time is a restrictive form of protection, in that trains are not allowed
into the work zone until the Roadway worker reports clear and gives back
authority to Control. Control has authority as whether or not to grant foul
time to a roadway worker. If the roadway worker fails to give back foul time,
trains will not be allowed to move until the roadway worker is contacted and
it is conﬁrmed the track is safe and the roadway worker(s) is clear.

Summary: A method of establishing on track protection where the
roadway worker in charge (RWIC) requests that the controller stop all
trains and track equipment from entering the work zone until all personnel
are clear of the track and the track is safe for train movement. Can only be
used at interlocking and electric switch lock locations.

Summary: This form of protection is used only in yards and auxiliary
tracks by making the track inaccessible by one of the following methods
below. Prior to making a yard track inaccessible, the shop supervisor
and Yard Master must be notiﬁed at Elati and Control must be notiﬁed at
Mariposa and auxiliary tracks.

a. Line the switch away from the track being worked on.

Residual Severity (Post-Control):
Residual severity is the potential consequence if the hazard occurs after
controls are in place. While the likelihood may drop, the consequence
usually remains the same unless protections are designed to limit impact
(e.g., barriers that prevent full contact or automatic shutoffs).

Residual Likelihood (Post-Control):
Residual likelihood is the reassessed probability that a hazard will occur
after all planned or implemented controls are in place. This considers the
effectiveness, reliability, and human factors related to the protections. It
should reﬂect real-world conditions, including whether the protections are
consistently applied, enforced, and understood.

Severity represents the expected level of harm or consequence to
workers or operations if the hazard occurs without any protections in
place. This includes injury, fatality, property damage, or system disruption.
Severity is judged by considering the worst credible outcome based on
historical incidents, exposure duration, task complexity, and proximity to
live rail.

Severity (Pre-Control):

Likelihood (Pre-Control):
Likelihood refers to the estimated probability of the hazard occurring
before any protective measures are implemented. This estimation is
based on historical data, ﬁeld observations, documented incidents or
near-misses, and expert judgment. It reﬂects how often similar events
have happened or are expected to occur under current conditions without
additional safeguards.

This approach ensures alignment with federal requirements while
improving ﬁeld-level understanding and application of safety controls.

The table is a tool to help ensure that roadway worker protection is riskinformed, job-speciﬁc, and compliant with both the RTA’s ASP and the
SSOA’s program standard. The safety risk assessments used to inform
these protections must be updated at least every two years and may
be informed by engineering inputs, safety assurance activities under
§673.27, investigation ﬁndings, and lessons learned from near misses or
unsafe conditions.

Redundant protections are deﬁned as layered safety measures that
reduce the likelihood of harm if a primary control fails. Examples include
ﬂagger protection, exclusive track occupancy, shunt devices, warning
systems, and power-off veriﬁcations. These protections are determined
based on factors such as type of work, location, and operational conditions.

Each category of work listed in the table represents a unique risk proﬁle.
The risks must be assessed using the agency’s Safety Risk Management
(SRM) process, and appropriate redundant protections—procedural and/
or physical—must be applied. Lone workers must be included in this
assessment and provided, at a minimum, with foul time or an SSOAapproved equivalent.

This table supports compliance with 49 CFR Part 671 by outlining the
required safety risk assessment process and identifying categories
of roadway work that require redundant protections. It aligns with the
Agency Safety Plan (ASP) and incorporates the methods in §673.25(c) and
(d) for identifying hazards and determining appropriate mitigations.

The RTD Light Rail Roadway Worker Protection (RWP) Manual is a fundamental document
required by Federal Transit Administration (FTA) regulations, speciﬁcally 49 CFR Part 671
and Colorado Code of Regulations 4-723-7. These regulations mandate that transit agencies
establish comprehensive safety procedures to protect personnel working on or near rail
tracks. The RWP Manual serves as the primary authority outlining these essential rules,
responsibilities (such as the Roadway Worker In Charge), and methods of protection.
This Track Access Guide serves as a crucial supplementary resource, designed to be utilized
in conjunction with the RWP Manual. It leverages site-speciﬁc survey data of the guideway to
provide detailed context and identify conditions requiring additional attention when selecting
and applying the appropriate form of roadway worker protection outlined in the RWP Manual.
When using both the Manual and this Guide, always remember that site conditions are
dynamic. Atmospheric changes (light, precipitation, temperature) and changes in ambient
noise can signiﬁcantly impact safety. Always refer to the Maximum Authorized Speed (MAS)
indicated; if uncertain, default to the higher speed to ensure adequate time to reach a place
of safety before a train arrives. The sight distances referenced are minimums for a 15-second
warning; allow additional time when conditions dictate or when the nature of the work
requires extra time to clear personnel, tools, or equipment to a place of safety.

The job brieﬁng is an essential part of Roadway Worker Protection. It ensures roadway workers
clearly communicate to each other details of the work plan, protection employed, hazards associated
with the planned work, and method of train approach warning prior to fouling a track.
Prior to entering the alignment a job brieﬁng must be conducted with all members of the work party
by the Roadway Worker In Charge. Lone workers must conduct a job brieﬁng with their supervisor
prior to entering alignment.
Debrieﬁng must be conducted after the work is completed. Debrieﬁng will include near misses,
lessons learned, follow up actions including reporting, and feedback on any good faith challenges
raised.
An “MOW Job Brieﬁng Form” and “MOW Job Debrieﬁng Forms” must be ﬁlled out and signed by all
members of the work party.
“MOW Job Brieﬁng Forms” and “MOW Job Debrieﬁng Forms” must be turned into supervision at
the end of shift.

JOB HAZARD ANALYSIS (JHA)
The purpose of a Job Hazard Analysis (JHA) is to describe how to perform tasks, identify associated
hazards, and determine controls to mitigate those hazards. Utilizing this JHA will allow us to analyze
work activities while also identifying tools, materials and equipment needed to safely complete a task.
During this process, existing and potential hazards, risks, and methods to eliminate or protect against
the hazards are identiﬁed.

A4 Good faith challenge

A good faith challenge is an opportunity to jointly resolve any Roadway Worker Protection concerns; it
is not a confrontation with your supervisor or RTD management. A job brieﬁng is the ﬁrst opportunity
to make a good faith challenge; however, a challenge can be made at any time. Challenges require
prompt and fair resolution.
RTD management fully supports a roadway worker’s absolute right to initiate a good faith challenge
without fear of retaliation or discipline. The good faith challenge process begins when an employee
raises an RWP concern.
Key Points:
1. Employees should remain clear of track until the challenge is resolved.
2. All roadway workers should know where to access RTD’s good faith challenge procedures and
understand the resolution process.
3. Roadway workers should periodically review the good faith challenge procedures during crew
meetings/job brieﬁngs.
4. Supervisors and co-workers should actively encourage the use of the good faith challenge.
5. RTD management should periodically review their Roadway Worker Protection program to identify
and remove any administrative or procedural barriers to the utilization of the good faith challenge.
Good Faith Challenge Process
Note: All good faith challenges steps will be held outside fouling distance.
1. Roadway worker has concern about on-track safety and discusses with Roadway Worker in Charge.
2. If challenge can be resolved, resume work. If challenge cannot be resolved, supervisor will
be contacted.
3. If supervisor cannot resolve over the phone, supervisor will report to the scene and evaluate
the challenge.
4. If onsite supervisor cannot resolve than MOW manager or his designee will be reached
for resolution.
5. If good faith challenge has merit, deﬁciencies will be corrected and employees will resume work.
If the good faith challenge has no merit, RWP will be explained by supervisor to Roadway worker and
employees will resume work.
Remember: If you are uncertain about your safety, trust your instincts; make a good faith challenge.
You may be saving your life.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
System Optimization Plan – 2025 Review and
Recommendations

September 10, 2025

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug Monroe, Manager, Corridor Planning
Jessie Carter, Senior Manager, Service Development
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
In July 2022, the RTD Board of Directors adopted the System Optimization Plan (SOP), the agency’s
branded name for its Comprehensive Operational Analysis (COA). The SOP was the short-term plan as
part of Reimagine RTD, while the Mobility Plan for the Future was the long-term plan. The SOP is a
detailed evaluation of travel patterns, demographics, and transit routes in the service area, and it
includes recommended modifications to RTD’s fixed-route services to better meet near-term mobility
needs in the region. Development of the SOP began in the fall of 2019 as part of the broader Reimagine
RTD effort and identified financially constrained service recommendations addressing immediate needs.
Goals established during the COVID-19 pandemic aimed to guide the development of service
recommendations as RTD was adapting to a changing travel market resulting from the pandemic as well
as increasingly constrained availability of transit resources, while continuing to address customer
comments and travel needs. These goals included increasing transit utilization, improving transit service
performance and efficiency, operating within RTD’s budget, addressing changing travel needs post2020, and improving service quality. RTD’s planned route reinstatements and modifications can be
found in the 2022 SOP.
DISCUSSION
This discussion provides an overview of the implementation of the SOP after it was approved by the
Board. The SOP prioritized a regionally focused, high-quality transit network to deliver strong
connectivity to equity communities and transit-supportive corridors. Phased implementation of the SOP
began in early 2023.
The 2025 SOP Review and Recommendations Report includes an assessment of the effectiveness of the
phased implementation of SOP recommendations. The report summarizes SOP changes implemented
from January 2023 through May 2025 and documents challenges and key themes the agency
encountered throughout the process.

Packet Pg. 695

1.E.2

Since the adoption of the SOP, RTD has embarked on a phased implementation while building upon
service enhancements. The selection and implementation of many SOP service initiatives have
responded to demand and travel patterns that have changed since 2020. Implementation has occurred
with constrained resources in tandem with state of good repair initiatives. This report assesses the
effectiveness of completed service initiatives while noting headwinds that may have impacted their
effectiveness, such as ongoing asset renewal, macro-economic trends, and even the implementation of
non-SOP-related service improvements.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with this discussion.

SOP Review and Recommendations Report

Executive Summary
RTD’s Board of Directors on July 26, 2022, adopted the SOP, a comprehensive redesign of
existing bus and rail services. Development of the SOP began in the fall of 2019 as part of the
broader Reimagine RTD effort and identified financially constrained service recommendations
addressing immediate needs. Goals established during the COVID-19 pandemic aimed to guide
the development of service recommendations as RTD was adapting to a changing travel market
resulting from the pandemic as well as increasingly constrained availability of transit resources,
while continuing to address customer comments and travel needs. These goals included
increasing utilization, improving transit service performance and efficiency, operating within
RTD’s budget, addressing changing travel demands, and improving the quality of RTD services.
SOP recommendations prioritized a regionally focused, high-quality transit network to deliver
strong connectivity to equity communities and transit-supportive corridors. Phased
implementation of the SOP began in early 2023.
This report is the first review and update of the SOP to the Board of Directors and includes an
assessment of the effectiveness of the phased implementation of SOP recommendations. The
report summarizes SOP changes implemented from January 2023 through May 2025 and
documents challenges and key themes the agency encountered throughout the process.
Since the adoption of the SOP, RTD has embarked on a phased implementation while building
upon service enhancements. The selection and implementation of many SOP service initiatives
have responded to demand and travel patterns that have changed since the pandemic.
Implementation has occurred with constrained resources in tandem with state of good repair
initiatives. This report assesses the effectiveness of completed service initiatives while noting
headwinds that may have impacted their effectiveness, such as ongoing deferred maintenance
and asset renewal, macroeconomic trends, and even the implementation of non-SOP-related
service improvements.

Key Themes Through SOP Implementation
•

•

•

Transit utilization decrease: Like other transit agencies, RTD experienced significant
transit utilization decrease at the start of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
pandemic. Since the early months of the pandemic, weekday commute-based trips have
experienced the largest total losses, while light rail and regional services have
experienced a higher percentage of losses. Rail overall has also been the slowest to
recover from these losses.
Workforce and operator mandating: In the four years preceding the pandemic, bus
and rail operator shortages led RTD to mandate work to maintain service. Mandating
resulted in lower retention rates for new operators, and a downward cycle that required
RTD to curb service levels to operator headcount. Operator mandating ended in 2021,
but headcount challenges persist.
Financial considerations: The SOP was originally developed within a financially
constrained scenario targeting 85% of 2019 revenue hours. The original set of
recommendations was estimated to require a little under $316 million in 2021 O&M
costs for SOP-related bus service (major changes to overall rail service except for service
pattern adjustments were not factored into SOP planning). Since then, due to

macroeconomic inflationary impacts, union requirements, and other factors, estimated
O&M costs for fiscal year 2025 have increased 20% to $355 million, which may squeeze
implementation efforts.
Zero Fare for Youth: After the success and popularity of the one-year Zero Fare for
Youth pilot program, RTD is continuing the program with funds from the Colorado
Energy Office. During the pilot, youth counts (where available) nearly doubled from
around 105,000 to almost 200,000 per month, despite overall utilization trending down.
Metro Locals, covering the central metro, had large gains and carried the most youth
customers but Boulder Local, Flatiron Flyer, and Boulder/Longmont Regional routes saw
the highest percentage increases in youth utilization, ranging from 124% to 168%
gains.
Deferred maintenance and asset renewal: RTD recently undertook an extensive
two-year rail infrastructure program. In 2023, RTD began repairing retaining walls along
the Southeast Corridor requiring speed restrictions and single tracking. Work on these
coping panels was completed ahead of schedule in August 2024. Starting in May 2024,
speed restrictions were implemented on the Southeast Corridor for several segments
between Louisiana-Pearl to Lincoln and Iliff Stations impacting E, H, and R Lines. Later
in the summer the slow zones were implemented on the D Line between Broadway and
Downtown Littleton Stations. Separately, the first phase of the Downtown Rail
Reconstruction Project ran between May and August of 2024, while the subsequent
three phases will resume in fall of 2025. The temporary impacts and delays to travel
speeds stemming from these investments have negatively impacted rail utilization.
16th Street reconstruction: In 2022, the City and County of Denver, in partnership
with RTD, began reconstruction of the 16th Street pedestrian mall and transitway
between Market Street and Broadway. Previously serving more than 32,000 people daily
between Denver Union Station and Civic Center Station, RTD’s 16th Street FreeRide
continues to operate on a detour along 15th and 17th streets between Curtis Street and
Civic Center Station during active construction. Shuttle service levels have been
impacted as a result and carrying capacity has been reduced. With completion of
construction targeted for the end of summer 2025, RTD is conservatively planning to
restart FreeRide operations along a renewed and rebranded 16th Street in the January
2026 service change.

Travel and Service Changes Since SOP
Utilization

RTD transit utilization was reviewed between August 2019 and September 2024. The SOP
implementation began during the May 2022 runboard (set of scheduled service), during ongoing
pandemic transit utilization recovery efforts. So far, only total weekend commuter rail boardings
have come close to returning to or exceeding pre-2020 utilization, aided primarily with strong A
Line utilization and the addition of the N Line during the pandemic. Regaining pre-2020 bus
utilization has proved most challenging for weekdays. Compared to August 2019, recent
weekday bus boardings are down around 42% and weekend days are around 20% lower.
However, recent utilization trends are positive: Weekday bus boardings grew by a quarter
between SOP approval and the September 2024 service change.
Rail utilization was hit hardest by the pandemic and has recovered slowly. After some initial
post-2020 recovery, rail boardings, and particularly boardings on light rail, have fallen recently,

SOP Review and Recommendations Report
very likely due to extensive track maintenance work and slow zones. From a post-2020 peak in
the May 2022 runboard, weekday rail boardings are down more than a quarter, with larger
declines during the weekend. However, total weekend commuter rail boardings have essentially
returned to pre-2020 levels. The A Line continues to carry higher daily utilization than the other
three lines combined (though still slightly lower than pre-2020), and the N Line, introduced in
September 2020, has doubled its opening month’s boardings.
Compared to pre-2020, the proportion of overall system boardings in the peak periods has
declined, while midday and, to a lesser extent, evening trips have grown. This shift likely
reflects the continued remote work arrangements for some industries.
After SOP approval in May 2022, productivity has markedly increased throughout the service
area. September 2024 was slightly less productive in terms of boardings per bus stop visits than
May 2024, which is reconciled by the continuing decline in rail utilization and increase in bus
utilization. Areas of the district with higher productivity increases include some of Denver’s
busiest corridors. Areas of steep decline were primarily limited to areas with rail stations and
parts of downtown Denver due to reduced service levels and suspensions on downtown free
shuttles, as well as service reductions on downtown-oriented routes.

Service Levels

At the onset of the pandemic, RTD slashed overall weekday service by 40% and to a lesser
extent (9% and 5%) on Saturdays and Sundays. Routes serving downtown Denver experienced
the most significant service reductions. After some intervening service increases and decreases,
by September 2024 weekday service regained three-quarters of its pre-2020 total, while
weekend service had been nearly fully restored. Local bus routes and commuter rail have more
weekend trips now than before the pandemic, and some regional connections, such as the
Flatiron Flyer, are nearly back to pre-2020 service levels.

Shifting Travel Patterns

An origin-destination analysis using anonymized, aggregated location data illustrated where the
highest concentration of travel occurs in the district today and may assist in refining future SOP
recommendations. Most travel appears concentrated in the midday to early afternoon, with
lower morning peak period travel. Transit utilization, in comparison, has a similar trend but
tends to peak an hour before all other travel. Other analysis agrees with this modern shift in
overall travel behavior. RTD has adjusted trip levels in response over the years.
A travel pattern analysis also identified high volumes of travel between several important areas,
which included links between downtown Boulder and communities to the east like Lafayette and
Louisville; downtown Denver and many surrounding areas; the DU campus with northeast
Denver; and Denver International Airport with Montbello, Green Valley Ranch, and other
adjacent communities to the south, among other connections. RTD provides broad coverage
and currently covers these links, but opportunities to realign service and improve direct
connections may exist.

RTD Service and Operations Since SOP Approval

As RTD gradually restored service levels following major reductions during the initial stages of
the pandemic, the agency once again faced familiar staffing challenges precipitated by bus and
rail operator retirements and separations. Hiring and retaining operators has become a critical

SOP Review and Recommendations Report
challenge that continues to hamper service delivery, let alone unfulfilled SOP changes. Running
headcount for bus operators remained between 755 and 810 in 2022 and 2023. Since April
2024 running headcount for bus operators has increased steadily to a March 2025 high of 926,
partly due to more robust hiring and retention efforts.
Increased operator headcounts follow the hiring of RTD’s first Chief People Officer in December
2022. A data-driven HR strategy has focused on strengthening recruitment and retention,
particularly for bus and rail operators. Key initiatives that are helping RTD rebuild its frontline
workforce include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

expanding the HR team with dedicated talent acquisition staff
introducing quarterly workforce reporting
partnering with operations staff to support new hires
improving operator training
creating pathways for non-operator positions to earn a commercial driver’s license (CDL)
and become eligible for new positions
improving compensation with bonuses and overtime pay
revamping management training to boost retention

Between January 2023 and August 2025, RTD completed SOP-related changes to 46 routes,
with varying degrees of consistency with the SOP. Most of the changes have been consistent
with the SOP recommendations. In some cases, a portion of the SOP recommendations have
been implemented, but other recommended changes to alignment, service span, or frequency
remain. In a handful of cases, the SOP recommendation was amended before implementation
to gain operational efficiencies or for compliance with the CBA.

Recommendations for Continued Implementation

As RTD looks ahead to the subsequent phasing in of the SOP, the agency should continue to
refine the new service category service parameters and adapt SOP recommendations to fit the
current operating context. Some of the remaining SOP changes were prioritized for near- and
mid-term implementation.

Route Categorization and Changes to Service Classifications

RTD categorizes its services in various ways for different analytical reporting and service
planning purposes, both for internal and external uses. In terms of service performance, RTD
currently categorizes its bus and rail services into four classes of fixed-route services including
Core, Connect, Commute, and Community. These classes and others continue to be used for
internal performance analysis and reporting, but other categories are also used in runboard
service and utilization reporting as well as for internal summary reports known as Recaps.
Because of the complexity of the organization, and to streamline both performance monitoring
and service planning, the SOP recommended a recategorization of routes into a new travel
market-based framework of services—Core, Connect, Commute and Community—with
associated generalized parameters of service levels, spans and days. A strict implementation of
service parameters across each service category would allocate resources (financial and
workforce) to routes and service periods that may be unjustified based on current route or
corridor performance, customer and community demand, or within the bounds of resource
availability. As such, the partial implementation of some SOP recommendations, while

Packet Pg. 713

SOP Review and Recommendations Report
appropriate based on local context, has sometimes resulted in amendments within the defined
service category service parameters.
RTD should continue applying the SOP service category service parameters where justified but
not out of orthodoxy. Some routes may warrant a change in service category based on
performance and route service area characteristics and may not neatly fit into the categories.
RTD should be flexible in determining shifts in a route’s service category or fine tuning of spans
or service levels as the system and service area characteristics evolve and should continue to
refine the categories to reflect current travel market conditions.

Refining SOP Recommendations

SOP recommendations were based on pre-2020 utilization and service productivity, service
resources, travel patterns, and anticipated future demand. Predicting future travel demand
during a global pandemic involved unprecedented uncertainty. However, during the pandemic
recovery efforts, RTD selected and modified improvements for phased implementation to fit the
evolving conditions, including available resources, and changes in transit utilization and travel
patterns. RTD should continue to scrutinize future SOP recommendations and have flexibility to
modify or even eliminate certain ones to meet current needs and operating parameters and to
optimize limited resources. Proposed future service changes (August 2025) will incorporate
additional SOP changes, including welcomed service increases where new analysis has
determined their merit.

SOP Review and Recommendations Report

Introduction
RTD’s SOP was adopted by the Board of Directors on July 26, 2022. At the time of approval, the
action was amended to require a review and update presented to the Board at least every three
years.
This report documents the first review and update of the SOP to the RTD Board of Directors.
The following identifies the purpose and goals of the SOP, outlines key themes across the
agency that have influenced the implementation of the SOP recommendations, documents SOP
service initiative implemented since Board adoption, identifies key findings from an analysis of
utilization and travel patterns in the post-2020 RTD, and identifies opportunities for refined SOP
recommendations and continued phased implementation.

Purpose of the SOP

The SOP effort began in the fall of 2019 and was part of a broader study, Reimagine RTD, that
also included a long-range strategic plan called the Mobility Plan for the Future. The SOP
identified financially constrained service plan recommendations that addressed more immediate
service needs, whereas the Mobility Plan for the Future is a comprehensive long-term plan that
presents strategies to address future transit needs of the region.
The SOP was developed through an evaluation of four service design scenarios based on
service quality, social equity, service productivity and geographic coverage. SOP
recommendations melded the four scenarios into a final service plan prioritizing a regionally
focused high-quality transit network that delivers strong connectivity to equity communities and
transit-supportive land use corridors within financial constraints and travel market demand in
2022.
Since adopting the SOP, RTD has embarked on a phased implementation of recommendations
building upon pandemic recovery service enhancements. RTD has engaged in implementing
SOP recommendations within resource constraints while advancing state of good repair
initiatives. These improvements have been focused on service performance, changing travel
demand, and customer feedback.

SOP Goals

The SOP established five goals to guide the implementation of service recommendations. These
goals are intended to guide RTD as it adapts to changing travel demand/patterns resulting from
the pandemic and changing availability of resources (financial and staffing), while addressing
customer comments and travel needs. It is important to note that the SOP was developed
during the COVID-19 pandemic, which focused on the most beneficial way to serve the region
within limited financial resources. The SOP is based on 85% of revenue hours provided in 2019
prior to the pandemic and incorporates the following objectives:
•
•
•
•

Increase transit utilization
Improve transit service performance/efficiency
Operate within budget
Address changing travel needs

SOP Review

Three years after the approval of the SOP, this report reviews the effectiveness of the phased
implementation of SOP service initiatives implemented from January 2023 through September
2024, and focuses on documenting:
•
•
•
•

Challenges and key themes encountered through implementation, including staff
availability and financial constraints
Impacting factors that influenced how and when RTD implemented SOP initiatives
Non-SOP-related service improvements, which may impact the anticipated
effectiveness of SOP changes
The effectiveness of the changes, understanding that initiatives implemented earlier
have had more time to mature through customers’ and the community’s response, while
others recently implemented will require additional time to determine their effectiveness

Challenges and Key Themes
Transit Utilization Decrease

Transit agencies nationwide have experienced a wide range of challenges during the postCOVID-19 pandemic recovery period. Many agencies have had difficulty hiring and maintaining
bus and rail operators, faced financial challenges resulting from decreased tax revenue streams,
saw structural changes in community travel behaviors and patterns associated with decreased
frequencies of work-related trips, and have been impacted by varying degrees of return to
office commuting. Travel patterns have also been impacted by the significant expansion of
courier services such as retail and food delivery services, which have affected when and if
specific trips continue to exist. The Denver Post, in May 2025, reported that Downtown Denver
office building visits are down 42% from March 2019 (ranking Denver fifth in the nation), foot
traffic is down 15%, and office vacancy rates are over 35% and nearing 40% when including
space marketed for subleasing. 1
Most transit agencies reduced transit service levels immediately after the pandemic’s onset, and
slowly increased service levels when and where demand returned. The effect of reduced transit
service on whether previous customers chose to return is hard to quantify. The combination of
customer health concerns and the change in community travel behaviors had a sudden and
dramatic impact on transit utilization starting in March 2020; RTD published a special pandemic
runboard in April of 2020, significantly reducing the amount of service provided due to
requirements for social distancing and work-from-home mandates. Although utilization has
recovered to varying degrees at many agencies, current travel behaviors and patterns remain
noticeably different compared to those prior to the pandemic.

Like other transit agencies, RTD experienced significant reductions in transit utilization at the
start of the pandemic, illustrated in Figure 1 as lower overall boardings recorded within the
special pandemic runboard from April through August of 2020. The most significant reductions
were with weekday commute-based trips, as most non-essential work trips evaporated
overnight with new work-from-home policies. Light rail and regional services experienced the
largest percentage loss in utilization in the early months of the pandemic. These services have
also been the slowest to recover from these utilization losses.

Workforce and Operator Mandating

In the years leading up to the pandemic, RTD faced persistent labor shortages among bus and
rail operators. Between 2016 and 2019, RTD added approximately 600,000 revenue hours, a
20% jump over 2013 service levels due to the opening of many of the FasTracks projects.
Meanwhile, Denver’s economy rapidly improved, and unemployment rates dropped from 6.1%
in 2014 to 2.6% in September 2019. This increasingly tight labor market strained RTD’s ability
to recruit and retain the necessary operator workforce. Prior to the initial shock of the
pandemic, RTD required 1,083 bus operators and 216 rail operators to maintain service levels
(based on normal operations). In November 2019, RTD employed 876 bus operators (81% of
need) and 161 rail operators (75% of need).
To maintain the newly expanded service, RTD frequently mandated overtime work from its
operators, disproportionately affecting those with lower seniority. Many bus and rail operators
were required to work six days a week every week for four years, contributing to lower
retention rates for new hires. In 2019 alone, RTD mandated nearly 70% of bus operators and
over 40% of rail operators to work one of their days off each week. Prior to 2016, there was
always some level of overtime available for those who desired to work extra hours. While RTD
took several actions to improve recruitment and retention efforts—including sign-on and referral
bonuses, split work shift incentive pay, professional development funds, higher starting rates,
and accelerated pay rate increase schedules—turnover remained high. Although there was a
significant increase in hires between January 2017 and September 2019, with 791 new bus
operators and 177 new train operators, 710 bus operators and 201 train operators left their
positions during the same period.

SOP Review and Recommendations Report

From the beginning of 2019 through September 2024, RTD provided 99.5% service availability,
but continued work mandates resulted in significant strain on staff. While incentives and work
mandates helped maintain service levels, eventually, reductions in service and dropped service
became more prevalent. With continued challenges in right-sizing staff, RTD was forced to
right-size service levels to staff availability.
The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 brought further disruption. In response to
reduced utilization and public health concerns, RTD significantly scaled back transit service
across all modes. While the service reductions were a temporary fix for the ongoing workforce
challenge, retirements and bus operator departures quickly reduced bus operator availability,
slowly returning RTD to the pre-2020 staffing challenges as demand for service levels
increased. RTD soon found itself facing the same staffing challenges as before, only now within
the broader context of pandemic uncertainties and shifting travel patterns.
More recently, operator headcount data shows a positive trend. RTD directly operates (DO)
roughly half of its bus service, all its light rail service and around 13% of its commuter rail
service. 2 The remaining operations are handled by a contracted service provider and are
accounted for as purchased transportation (PT). For RTD’s directly operated (DO) services, the
recent monthly tracking of operator hires and separations shows a steady recovery in staffing
levels. The running total of RTD’s DO bus and rail operator headcount from 2022 through the
first quarter of 2025, shown in Figure 2, is based on the monthly net of new hires. In 2022
and 2023, the average DO operator headcount remained in the mid to high 700s. Sustained
recruiting and hiring efforts have paid off: From early 2024 to the first quarter of 2025, total DO
headcount has had sustained increases, reaching 926 in March of 2025. While challenges
remain and the operator headcount is still lower than needed, this trend is moving in the right
direction in rebuilding RTD’s workforce.

Chief People Officer

RTD in December 2022 hired its first CPO, who oversees a revised HR strategy informed by
RTD's Strategic Initiatives adopted in 2021 – Back to Basics, People Power, Customer and
Community Connections, and Welcoming Transit Environment – which focus on data,
recruitment, and retention and allowed RTD to overcome its workforce challenges. According to
quarterly HR updates, several tactics have contributed to the overall success.
Adding the HR department capacity was critical for RTD to achieve its recruitment and retention
goals. In addition to the CPO role, RTD hired a Director of Talent Acquisition and a Director of
Total Rewards. RTD also brought on dedicated talent acquisition specialists to focus on hiring
key roles, including bus operators and transit police.

Reporting recruitment and retention metrics allowed the CPO and Board to track progress
toward specific workforce goals. RTD’s CPO delivers quarterly HR updates to the Operations,
Safety and Security Committee of the Board of Directors, summarizing the key hiring and
retention metrics quarter-over-quarter. RTD tracks employee vacancies on its public-facing
Performance Dashboard. Stay interviews are conducted just after an employee is onboarded,
and optional exit interviews offer insights into why employees are drawn to RTD or separate.
RTD has used this interview data to refine its recruitment and retention strategies. HR is also
improving retirement modeling to forecast when additional recruitment will be needed.
Hiring and retaining bus operators has been a priority under the CPO. A strategic partnership
between HR and the Bus Operations Division has allowed RTD to improve bus operator hiring
and retention. Subject matter experts from the Bus Operations team are now integrated into
the hiring process, meeting with prospective candidates to discuss bus operator duties to test

job fit. Since retention data reveals that if RTD can retain bus operators for 18 months, they
tend to remain for multiple years, new operators have frequent check-ins with HR, their
supervisor, and their manager over their first year and a half.
Increasing the competitiveness of compensation has likely helped attract more job applicants to
RTD. A CBA with the ATU in 2022 secured cumulative pay raises, and the agreement in 2025
further raises the hourly wage for bus operators. Ending mandatory overtime in 2021 was
critical to providing a more balanced work schedule, which is already a challenge for more
junior bus operators. RTD currently offers a signing bonus and double-time pay for overtime for
certain positions.
Under an agreement with the union, operator positions earn a stipend when they earn their
CDL. RTD has also created opportunities for non-bus operator employees to earn a CDL and
transition into a bus operator role or another role requiring a CDL.
Finally, a revised supervisor and manager training program between Q4 2023 and Q3 2024
aimed to improve management capabilities and retain employees.

Financial Considerations

The cost of operating transit is a key factor when planning for service, and the annual cost for
operations and maintenance (O&M) was estimated for SOP bus service recommendations based
on a 15% reduction in bus hours. This cost factored in different unit costs for new service types
based on current service classifications and the existing varied costs associated with those
services. Unit costs indicate what each unit of bus service, in this case, revenue hours, costs to
operate. Unit costs can be incremental, meaning they exclude administrative costs and provide
cost estimates for incremental changes in service, or fully allocated, meaning they include all
costs the agency bears. Fully allocated costs based on estimated revenue hours were used to
estimate annual O&M costs for the SOP.
Using the estimated 2.45 million annual bus revenue hours required of the SOP at that time, the
SOP was estimated to have annual O&M costs of around $315.6 million based on 2021 dollars,
resulting in an overall fully allocated unit cost of $128.85 per revenue hour (Table 1). This cost
was based on a projection between 2019 and 2021 and assumed no major impact to overall
financials. Based on 3% inflation per year, the O&M costs for SOP bus operations is estimated
at a little over $355 million for 2025, an increase of 20% from 2021. This is in comparison to
RTD’s Budget Book budget estimate of Bus Operations in 2025 of nearly $450 million, which is
13% higher than the SOP estimate. A new unit cost for the SOP estimate based on 2025 dollars
results in a unit cost of $145.02 per revenue hour. Because of macroeconomic inflationary
impacts, union requirements, new initiatives, and other factors, increased operation costs may
squeeze SOP implementation efforts.

Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis and Zero Fare for Youth

A key recommendation from RTD’s 2023 Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis was to
pilot a Zero Fare for Youth (ZFY) program to encourage transit use from a young age. This oneyear pilot program was in place September 1, 2023, to August 31, 2024. Individuals 19 years
and younger, regardless of residency or school enrollment, were eligible for zero-fare rides on
all RTD services providing access to affordable, equitable, and simple transit options. The ZFY
pilot was successful in growing youth utilization, and there has been an overwhelmingly positive
response to the program from the community.

RTD is continuing the ZFY program from September 1, 2024, to January 31, 2026, with funding
from the Colorado Energy Office (CEO). The program meets the statutory objectives of SB24032 to increase transit use by allowing youth ages 19 and younger to utilize RTD’s transit
network at no cost.
For the pilot program, starting in September 2023 through the end of the ZFY pilot in August
2024, operators on most RTD bus routes began quantifying the number of youth customers. It
is not feasible to count youth on some services such as rail lines with off-board fare collection
and all-door boarding, and services for which fares are not collected such as the downtown
shuttles. Despite those limitations, youth were continually counted on around 100 routes on
each runboard and operators continue to count youth customers for ongoing program
assessment. As shown in Figure 3, over a 12-month assessment period, total monthly
systemwide boardings on both bus and rail services declined, bus-only utilization remained
mostly unchanged, and youth customers nearly doubled from around 105,000 to nearly 200,000
monthly customers, indicating a strong pick-up of transit usage among youth customers despite
flagging boardings among customers in general. Among bus service types, Metro Local (most
RTD routes) and Boulder Local routes carried the highest total counts of youth, and Boulder
Locals, Flatiron Flyer, and Boulder/Longmont Regional routes saw the highest percentage
increases, ranging from 124% to 168%. Youth utilization exhibited a seasonality, likely as a
function of the school calendar, with increases from fall through spring and drops in months
with important holidays or breaks. Additionally, nearly all the gains have occurred on weekdays,
while weekends have seen much less youth utilization.

Deferred Maintenance and Asset Renewal

RTD continues to invest in maintaining its rail system through state of good repair projects.
However, after 30 years of rail operations, many elements of the original infrastructure are past
their useful life. Therefore, RTD has embarked on a repair and replacement program for its
oldest rail infrastructure to ensure long-term integrity. Although these projects are necessary to
provide a safe and productive rail system, the temporary impacts and delays to travel speeds
due to service rerouting stemming from these investments have significantly impacted light rail
utilization.

Coping Panel Project: April 2023 through August 2024 3

Starting in April 2023, RTD began a maintenance project to repair the caps on retaining walls,
also known as coping panels, that run along I-25 on the Southeast light rail corridor. Singletrack operations were implemented along various alignment segments as the project advanced,
resulting in train speed restrictions and slowdowns. A pause in work occurred between fall 2023
and May 2024. The second and final phase of the Coping Panels Project began May 26, 2024,
and crews were able to complete the project weeks ahead of schedule in August 2024. Light rail
trains are now fully operating on both tracks, though some temporary speed restrictions
remained through May 2025.

Light Rail Speed Restrictions 4

Temporary speed restrictions were in place on the D, E, H, and R lines beginning in May 2024
to address rail infrastructure maintenance. In early April 2025, RTD updated its maintenance
timeline and ended all speed restrictions on May 27, 2025. RTD had a total of 31 slowdowns
over the past year in four different zones. Speed restrictions for Zones 1 and 2 began July 4,
2024, while those for Zones 3 and 4 began July 12, 2024. Trains were restricted to 10 miles per
hour on the following lines:
•
•
•
•

Zone 1
o E Line: University of Denver through Belleview stations
o H Line: University of Denver through Dayton stations
Zone 2
o E and H Lines: Orchard through Sky Ridge stations
Zone 3
o H Line: Southmoor through Iliff stations
o R Line: Belleview through Iliff stations
Zone 4
o D Line: Evans through Littleton•Mineral stations

Downtown Rail Replacement Project 5

RTD began the Downtown Rail Reconstruction Project in May 2024. This project leverages
previous work completed in the central corridor (e.g., rail replacement, switches, crossings and
signals) between 2012 and 2023. The downtown project is designed for completion in four

phases. Phase I of the project, completed in August 2024, focused on reconstructing light rail
track and infrastructure at five key intersections in the downtown loop. During Phase I
construction, RTD rerouted the D and H lines to Denver Union Station and suspended the L
Line. Phases two through four will resume in Fall 2025, and like Phase I, will impact some bus
routes and the D, H and L lines at various times. RTD is developing service plans to account for
the work while coordinating with the City and County of Denver to minimize vehicle and
pedestrian impacts.

Free MallRide 16th Street Reconstruction

Starting in 2022 the Denver Department of Transportation and Infrastructure (DOTI), in
partnership with RTD and the City and County of Denver, began construction activities related
to renovating the 16th Street pedestrian mall and transitway between Market Street and
Broadway. This project aims to improve safety and mobility, address deteriorating
infrastructure, and provide opportunities for people who live, work, and visit the area. The
reconstruction represents the culmination of over a decade of planning and community input to
inform the design and function of the new 16th Street. Constructed over 40 years ago, the 16th
Street pedestrian mall remains a major link through downtown Denver running between Denver
Union Station and Civic Center Station. Over time, 16th Street’s aging infrastructure reached its
useful lifespan and required updates to address safety and maintenance issues.
The new 16th Street will have a reconfigured layout with wider sidewalks, new amenities, and a
return of transit running through the center, some of which is rendered in Figure 4. Previously
serving over 32,000 people daily, RTD’s Free MallRide shuttle provided frequent service
between Union Station and Civic Center Station. The Free MallRide, rebranded as the 16th
Street FreeRide, continues to operate on a detour route along 15th and 17th streets between
Curtis Street and Civic Center Station.
Although completion of construction work is targeted for the end of August 2025, contractors
are likely to have a 30-day period of final project-related activities. RTD is conservatively
planning to restart FreeRide operations along 16th Street in the January 2026 service change.

Phased SOP Implementation to Date
The SOP includes changes to 119 routes, with unique recommendations for route variants such
as short and long patterns, alternating service, and limited service. Between January 2023 and
August 2025, SOP-related changes were made to 46 RTD routes or about 40% of the SOP route
recommendations. A description of each change and its degree of consistency with the SOP is
summarized by service change in Table 2 through Table 10, and includes the following
categories:
•
•

•
•

Consistent: Changes to service frequencies, service span, or alignment that match
original recommendations.
Partial: Indicates some of the recommendations for a given route have been
implemented, but additional changes remain, or minor adjustments were made based
on new information such as recent performance data.
Exceed: Increases in service span or frequency above original recommendations.
Amended: Changes that have been amended from the original recommendations based
on more current data, implemented for a variety of reasons, such as for CBA compliance
and operational constraints. Amendments to SOP recommendations were reviewed
through the Board approval process. More details on these amendments are provided in
the Appendix.

Utilization, Service and Travel
Patterns
Transit utilization and scheduled service from the August 2019 runboard to the September 2024
runboard provide a picture of changing travel behaviors through the three major milestones in
RTD service — pre-COVID, Board adoption of the SOP, and today (Figure 5). RTD typically
updates service three times each year, adjusting schedules and other operational changes, then
tabulates the resulting service and utilization by stop over a generally four-to-five-month period
known as a runboard. Data within each runboard includes the mean daily utilization activity by
stop, averaged across the runboard. This detailed data compiles activity for RTD’s four primary
modes of service, each route number and name, and trips identified by service day, direction
and trip times, for every stop. Seventeen consecutive runboards’ worth of trips show how
people were riding RTD before, at the beginning of, and during ongoing phased implementation
of the SOP. Month and year references in the following sections indicate the runboard dates.

July 26, 2022

Major lasting impacts from COVID-19, exemplified between the August 2019 and May 2022
runboards, continue to reverberate. Though overall utilization has increased since COVID-19
lows in January 2021, today’s utilization is roughly half what it was pre-2020 and just 90% of a
recent peak in May 2023. However, utilization has not uniformly changed. Bus and rail
utilization were impacted differently, and changes for those services also varied by day. To
identify changes of significance in support of continued phased implementation of the SOP, the
service and utilization data from the 17 runboards were examined at several levels, including
systemwide, by mode, by day and by period of day. Finally, geographic information provided by
stop-level detail allows for an understanding of service utilization and productivity across the
district.

Systemwide Transit Utilization

RTD utilization, including both rail and bus boardings, is shown in Figure 6 across all 17
runboards to focus on activity at three key time points: pre-2020 peak within the August 2019
runboard, Board approval of the SOP in the May 2022 runboard, and more recently within the
September 2024 runboard with the latest complete service and utilization data.
RTD averaged around 356,000 total weekday boardings pre-2020 and dropped nearly 70% to a
low of 110,000 daily boardings by the January 2021 runboard, four runboards into the
pandemic. Weekend boardings were slightly more resilient during this period, declining by
closer to 50%.
The most significant utilization recovery occurred between the lowest level of boardings and the
May 2022 runboard, when average system boardings grew 62% for weekdays, 77% on
Saturdays, and around 63% for Sundays. Since the May 2022 runboard, weekday boardings
have grown a little over 4%, Sundays have increased by just 1% and Saturdays have fallen 8%.
More recently, weekday boardings are down over 47% since pre-2020, while Saturdays and
Sundays are down by 24% and 21%, respectively.

Bus utilization, including bus and Flatiron Flyer bus rapid transit (BRT), as shown in Figure 7,
followed a similar pattern of steep decline at the onset of the pandemic before trending upward
through and beyond SOP approval, then declining slightly again during the last few runboards
to September 2024. However, bus utilization proved to be more resilient than rail service.
Although weekday bus boardings declined 67% from the August 2019 runboard to the worst
impacts of the pandemic in the January 2021 runboard, they grew 42% by the SOP approval,
and by another quarter between the SOP approval within the May 2022 runboard and the
September 2024 runboard. Weekend days had similar patterns. Saturday boardings halved by
January 2021, increased by 42% by May 2022, and increased another 11% by September 2024.
Sundays fell 48% by early 2021, increased by a third by May 2022, then saw another 20%
increase by September 2024. Overall, compared to August 2019, bus boardings for weekdays
are down 42%, down 21% for Saturdays, and down nearly 17% for Sundays, indicating that
regaining pre-2020 utilization has been most challenging on weekdays.

As seen with changes in bus utilization across this multi-year period, the pandemic severely
reduced rail boardings and continues to impact travel on RTD’s rail services. Unlike bus
utilization, which bottomed out in the January 2021 runboard, rail boardings saw the lowest
point earlier, during the special pandemic runboard covering the months of April through
August 2020. As shown in Figure 8 through Figure 12, from August 2019 to the onset of the
pandemic, combined weekday rail boardings declined by three-quarters, a decline similar to the
nearly 70% drop in bus boardings. However, by SOP approval in mid-2022, rail regained a
higher proportion of utilization than bus: weekday boardings improving to 57% pre-2020 levels,
7% higher than pre-2020 Saturday boardings, but 8% lower on Sundays.

SOP Review and Recommendations Report
From their post-2020 peak in the May 2022 runboard until the September 2024 runboard,
however, boardings on RTD rail have fallen across all rail services and for each day of the week.
Most of this loss is likely attributable to the important, but extensive and extremely disruptive,
deferred maintenance and asset renewal that occurred within recent runboards. Recent declines
mean weekday rail utilization lost any gains made by the May 2022 runboard, ending one-fifth
to one-third lower than in that runboard, and down almost a third to less than half from August
2019 levels. Weekday activity is down the most, with boardings down nearly 60% since pre2020 levels and 27% below the May 2022 peak. Boardings on Saturdays, which had previously
averaged above pre-2020 levels, are down nearly 30%, with all that loss occurring since May
2022. Sunday boardings are down 22% since May 2022 and 28% since pre-2020.
Trips taken on commuter lines proved more resilient than light rail through global and local
disruptions in travel behaviors. At the onset of the pandemic and before the opening of the N
Line in September 2020, weekday commuter rail boardings fell 67%, as regional commuting
and airport trips disappeared, compared to a 78% fall in light rail boardings. By the time the
SOP was adopted within the May 2022 runboard, weekday commuter rail boardings were 75%
of pre-2020 boardings compared to light rail, which climbed to only half of prior levels. Since
then, weekday commuter rail boardings have fallen around 12% while light rail has fallen over
36%, with the largest drops in the last two runboards.
Weekend utilization for both rail modes is shown in Figure 9 and Figure 10. From the August
2019 runboard to the time of the SOP’s approval within the May 2022 runboard, light rail
utilization had increased by 11% on Saturday but fell by over 14% on Sundays following halving
or greater losses through the pandemic. Between May 2022 and the September 2024 runboard,
boardings halved on Saturdays and fell 35% on Sundays, and light rail weekend boardings are
less than half of historic highs. Weekend commuter rail boardings, however, are nearly back to
pre-2020 levels.

Commuter Rail

Disaggregating commuter rail weekday boardings by line, as shown in Figure 11, reveals how
each line contributed to overall utilization. The A Line, which links Denver’s airport with
downtown, had an outsized impact on overall trends due to much higher boardings than the
other three commuter lines combined. It was also the most resilient among commuter lines
operating both pre-2020 to now, carrying more than twice all other lines. Although weekday
boardings are down 39% overall, boardings have climbed 75% since the pandemic, or from the
January 2021 runboard. The G Line had the second highest utilization (though still only a
quarter of the A Line) and is at roughly half of its pre-2020 peak. B Line boardings are down
nearly three-fourths from August 2019. N Line service debuted in September 2020, so it lacks a
pre-2020 comparison, but has more than doubled its opening month’s boardings of 1,700
customers.
Although weekend utilization was historically one-third less than weekday utilization, total
boardings on Saturdays and Sundays are now essentially as high as current weekday levels.
Additionally, overall commuter weekend utilization is nearly back to pre-2020 levels, with overall
boardings on Saturdays 8% below and boardings on Sundays around 5% below those in the
August 2019 runboard period.

Light Rail

Tracking boardings by individual light rail line, as shown in Figure 12, indicate which lines have
the most boardings but also show the long-lasting impacts from the pandemic as well as those
from significant but needed track maintenance. Pre-2020, the light rail network carried an
average of over 87,000 weekday boardings. The H, E, W, and F Lines all carried more than
10,000 boardings each weekday. The C and F Lines were consolidated into the D and E Lines in
early and late 2020. Following an 80% loss, a recent peak of light rail boardings in May 2022
took eight runboards to regrow but is still half of pre-2020 utilization. Boardings have fallen
another third since then, with large fluctuations between September 2023 and May 2024 due to
track maintenance work and the resultant decline in service quality, and are currently around
68% below August 2019 levels overall. Compared to pre-2020 levels, Saturday boardings are
down nearly half, and Sunday boardings are down around 36% overall.

Boardings by Service Mode and Time of Day
Changes in service modes indicated varying changes in customer behavior in the periods both
before and after approval of the SOP. In the COVID runboards prior to the SOP approval in May
2022, shown in Figure 13, weekday boardings saw larger declines than those on weekend
days, with Flatiron Flyer (BRT) and light rail services having the largest declines overall, with
nearly 73% and more than 50% respective losses of their customers. Weekend boardings
declined around 20% to 30% for bus modes whereas commuter rail boardings on the weekend
have actually seen slight increases compared to pre-2020 boarding totals, and Saturday
boardings on light rail have increased over 10%.
Figure 14 shows the overall change in boardings by mode between May 2022 and September
2024. More recently, boardings on bus modes for all days have had increases with larger
increases on weekdays and Sundays. Bus and BRT boardings are up by around one quarter,
though both are down 40% and 66% since pre-2020 highs. Commuter and light rail utilization
is down for all days, with the largest declines on light rail for weekday and Saturday utilization
primarily due to deferred maintenance and asset renewal work in the last couple of runboards.

People have changed not only what type of service they use and on what day, but also when
they use transit. Weekday boardings by period of day (Figure 15) and their proportions
(Figure 16) across the 17 runboards show how people overall have shifted travel on RTD into
later periods over time. In August 2019, weekday peak period boardings, those in the three
hours between 6 and 9 a.m. and those in the afternoon between 3 and 6 p.m., accounted for
around one out of every two trips a day (see Table 11 for RTD’s division of operating hours
into service periods). At the onset of the pandemic, the total number of peak period boardings
declined by three-quarters, a larger loss than midday — which has the next largest volume of
travel, and which declined almost 60%. AM peak travel fell 78% while PM peak travel fell 73%,
and early morning travel, though only constituting around 12,000 trips pre-2020 — fell 67%,
indicating more negative change in the earlier periods of day.

While travel in both peak periods and midday fell due to pandemic impacts, travel between 9
a.m. and 3 p.m. increased as a share of all travel. Following drastic declines, boardings have
increased primarily in the midday and PM peak periods. While total weekday boardings are
nearly half of what they were pre-2020, more recently and as a share of total boardings travel
in the early AM is 6% less than pre-2020, midday travel is 6% more, and PM peak travel is 7%
more. Other periods are proportionally the same.
The review revealed a flattening of the peaks: The decline and subsequent limited recovery in
utilization was not equally distributed throughout a typical weekday and resulted in a

redistribution of boardings that has led to increasing parity between peak and midday travel
over time. The gap between peak and midday utilization was 20% in August 2019, 7% by SOP
approval, and 6% by September 2024. Although peak and midday utilization have both
increased since SOP approval, they have increased by similar amounts, further cementing the
growing parity.

Figure 17 clearly shows the change in travel by time period and compares the proportion of
travel within each daily period both pre-2020 and more recently. Peak travel made up more
than half of all trips previously compared to more recently, where peak travel is 44% of all trips.
Currently, a greater proportion of trips occur in other times, primarily during midday compared
to in the past. The decline in the proportion of peak trips is closely related to the decline in
weekday workplace attendance, both due to the initial shock of the pandemic and as a lasting
result of work-from-home policies. Evening and early trip distributions were less affected, as
customers utilizing RTD at these times may have a higher likelihood of conducting non-work
trips or are employed in sectors that are less conducive to remote work.

On a per hour basis, comparing total hourly boardings, boardings in the AM peak and midday
are similar, while the PM peak has higher boardings. Hourly boardings in the other periods,
early AM, PM evening and late as well as other times, are roughly similar, with around 4,300 to
6,700 hourly boardings.
When comparing how hourly boardings have changed over the course of the day between pre2020, when the SOP was adopted, and more recently as in Figure 18, improvements have
primarily occurred in the middle of the day. Previously, peak travel saw 1.5 to 1.8 times more
boardings than midday travel. Now, midday hourly boardings are roughly the same as AM peak
productivity, and PM peak productivity is just 1.3 times more than midday. Saturday (Figure
19) and Sunday (Figure 20) travel exhibited a gradual increase throughout the day, rising
highest within the afternoon peak; current travel is similar, although hourly boardings are
roughly 20% to 30% lower overall.

In addition to reviewing transit utilization data for insights into changes in travel behavior,
RTD’s scheduled service was also analyzed to track changes in total system trips across time
(Figure 21). From August 2019 until the pandemic runboard in April 2020, RTD operated
around 10,600 total daily weekday trips, with around 87% of those for bus service. Saturdays
had around 6,200 trips and Sundays had around 5,000. By the onset of the pandemic, RTD cut

Attachment: System Optimization Plan 2025 Review and Recommendations Report [Revision 1] (5177 : System Optimization Plan – 2025

Packet Pg. 740

SOP Review and Recommendations Report
weekday service by 40%, while Saturdays and Sundays had smaller percentage reductions of
9% and 5% , respectively.
Restoration of service progressed haltingly from the pandemic until today. From April 2020
through the last four months of 2021, RTD slowly reintroduced service. In terms of total trips,
weekdays gained around half of their former total, Saturdays were nearly fully restored, and
Sundays had more trips than pre-2020. By May 2022, RTD again reduced total trips across the
system primarily due to seasonal “tripper” adjustments on routes with special trips timed for
school operations. Small service increases were made until May 2024, when another reduction
in trips was made. By the September 2024 runboard, weekday trips constituted only 73% of the
August 2019 total, while weekend service was nearly back to pre-2020 levels.
Reviewing service levels by service type provides some nuance to the changes. While weekday
service is around 27% lower than pre-2020, service reductions of 40% to 70% were made on
routes serving downtown Denver, such as elimination of trips on the Free MallRide, Flatiron
Flyer, and regional routes, and suspension of the Free MetroRide. Service on local routes is
22% lower than before COVID-19, while weekend bus service actually has more trips now than
pre-2020. Total rail trips on Saturdays and Sundays make up around 83% of former service
levels. Local bus routes and commuter rail have more weekend trips now than before the
pandemic, and some regional routes such as the Flatiron Flyer are nearly back to pre-2020
service levels, while other services like the rebranded 16th Street FreeRide and regional routes
are still lower than before.

Change in Bus Stop and Rail Station Utilization

Additional context was given to the changes in transit utilization by evaluating the gains and
losses in utilization by stop and station location within the district.

August 2019 through May 2022

Changes in stop and station weekday boardings from the pre-2020 era (August 2019) to the
May 2022 runboard (SOP Board approval) are shown geographically for bus in Figure 22 and
rail in Figure 23. Pre-2020, the system averaged 355,798 weekday boardings systemwide. By

Attachment: System Optimization Plan 2025 Review and Recommendations Report [Revision 1] (5177 : System Optimization Plan – 2025

Packet Pg. 741

SOP Review and Recommendations Report
the May 2022 runboard, this declined to 178,981 weekday boardings systemwide, a drop of
about 50%.
The impact of the pandemic on bus utilization across the system is clear, as nearly all stops
experience utilization loss. Bus utilization loss at transit centers and rail stations appear greater
in Figure 22 because they represent the cumulative change in utilization for all routes serving
each location. Utilization loss in the Boulder area is overrepresented due to the comparison of
in-school September 2019 runboard utilization to out-of-school May 2022 runboard utilization.
One exception is the N Line, which began service after the worst utilization declines of the
pandemic and represented net increases in utilization due to the lack of service in those
locations in August 2019.
Other locations of decreased utilization include areas in and around downtown Denver (Free
MetroRide suspension) related to significant loss in commuter trips to and from downtown, and
the East Colfax, Federal Boulevard, Martin Luther King Boulevard, and Havana Street corridors.
Although limited and typically isolated to single bus stops, bus stop utilization increased at
select stops along the East and West Colfax corridors, and North Federal Boulevard corridor.

May 2022 through September 2024

Figure 24 and Figure 25 illustrate the change in boardings per bus stop and rail station,
respectively, from May 2022 to September 2024. Utilization has grown between May 2022 and
September 2024, resulting from the additional bus service SOP enhancements implemented by
RTD, and organic growth in a post-2020 period. Bus utilization has reversed the pandemicrelated loss in key corridors across the system, including Downtown Denver, East and West
Colfax, Federal Boulevard, Parker Road, Havanna Street, Peoria Street, and the US 36 corridor.
Utilization gains in the Boulder area are overrepresented due to the comparison of out-of-school
May 2022 runboard utilization to in-school September 2024 runboard utilization.
Rail utilization losses continue to persist during the May 2022 to September 2024 period. Most
of this loss is likely attributable to the important, but extensive and extremely disruptive,
deferred maintenance and asset renewal that occurred within recent runboards. The E and H
lines show the largest station level daily boarding losses during this period, while the other rail
lines reflect smaller station level of daily boarding loss.

Overall Travel Patterns (Replica Analysis)

Utilization data from RTD provides insight into travel patterns on transit but fails to capture
other travel across the district. To understand total travel patterns, and to help identify gaps in
RTD service that are not covered by existing or future SOP recommended service, an origindestination analysis was completed. This helped identify areas with high concentrations of
travel, places between which people are traveling across the district, and at what times of day
and the week.
This evaluation uses anonymized mobile device location data, made available through the
enterprise data platform Replica, to determine travel volumes and travel patterns throughout
the district. The data reflect total average travel volumes for weekdays in March through May of
2024, the most recent and reliable timeframe for available Replica data. Trip data used in the
analysis exclude commercial and freight trips, pass-through trips (i.e., trips with no major
activity within the district), and trips longer than 80 miles.

Time of Day

One of the focus areas when developing the SOP was to target service to when people travel
and to ensure service is available when people need it. Figure 26 compares the hourly totals of
Replica trip data with an average of total hourly boardings in the January and May 2024
runboards. Both data sets show a double peak of travel with the bulk of travel occurring midday
through evening. Replica data indicates a small morning peak with most travel occurring later in
the day and peak travel occurring in the afternoon compared to earlier hours, particularly
between 3 and 7 p.m. This generally aligns with utilization data that shows more travel
occurring in the midday through PM peak periods compared to other times. One difference
between the boarding data and Replica data is the earlier rise in transit boardings by
approximately an hour, along with a quicker decline in afternoon travel compared to all trips.

The boarding data is also compared to the level of service RTD has targeted based on initial
SOP implementation. Figure 27 compares the total count of systemwide trips in each weekday

each hour and shows how trips ramp up over the course of the day to match activity. In the 7
a.m. hour, looking at total RTD boardings and total systemwide trips, service productivity
approaches 30 boardings per trip while the 3 and 4 p.m. hours have productivities that peak at
36 boardings per trip. Average productivity across the entire day is just under 27 boardings per
hour, indicating the system’s above-average productivity occurs in the 7 a.m. hour and from
noon to 5 p.m.

Major Activity Areas

Areas of major trip making activity across the district were assessed using a hexagonal cell
structure. These cells cover an area of three-tenths of a square mile (or roughly the size of a
five-by-five grid of blocks in downtown Denver) to identify activity in greater detail. The sizes of
these hexagonal cells differ from the utilization analysis and are based on recommendations
from Replica. Hexagons were also utilized to avoid more complex calculations needed to
normalize traffic volumes and densities for different geographic units.
Trips are measured by their destination, meaning that locations where trips end were counted
to estimate total trip volumes. Areas with higher trip making activity are darker and are shown
in Figure 28. Overall, RTD’s existing network coverage appears well aligned for nearly all high
activity areas, particularly downtown cores of cities, areas of known major employment, areas
of dense housing, and major corridors. While travel activity has some scattered locations of
higher concentration, these areas may not necessarily warrant frequent fixed route transit
services due to the land uses and lower densities, but other transit service options may be
appropriate.
As with service productivity maps, future SOP recommendations were layered over travel hot
spots to compare future service changes with where people generally travel (Figure 29). Some
areas of review in terms of alignment with SOP values and recommendations may be needed in
some of the same unserved areas noted previously, as well as parts of south Aurora (Smoky Hill
Road corridor and Southlands area) and southwest Denver (South Wadsworth corridor).

Trip Links

The second analysis using Replica data builds upon the initial heat map of overall trip activity by
focusing on the connections between places within the district with a high volume of trip links,
to identify areas or movements that RTD service may not necessarily be serving well. As with
the major activity areas analysis, trips are filtered to exclude commercial and freight trips, passthrough trips, trips less than 5 miles, and trips with lengths more than 80 miles. Trips less than
5 miles are also filtered out specifically for this analysis to avoid top trip pairs between adjacent

hexagons. Trips longer than 5 miles also have higher potential to be taken by transit than by
biking and walking. The trip pairs represent important commuter flows, access to major activity
centers such as the airport or universities, or other critical links across the district.
Figure 30 visualizes an analysis of bidirectional trip totals, showing connections between major
trip origins and destinations inferred by Replica’s data, and identifies the top “trip pairs” where
high volumes of people are consistently traveling between two areas. Larger hexagonal cells are
used here, covering an area of two square miles, so that trip patterns at both regional and
neighborhood scales can be detected. Top trip pairs identified between these areas include:
•
•
•
•
•

Downtown Denver Civic Center with both northeast and southeast Denver
Denver International Airport and Montbello, northeast Aurora
Anschutz Medical Campus area and south Aurora (Buckley Road/Quincy Avenue and
Southlands areas)
Downtown Boulder and mid-CO 119 (office/research campuses), Lafayette, north of
Broomfield
Downtown Boulder and downtown Denver

While the current transit service nominally links these areas, the degree to which these travel
movements are directly served is unknown. The mapping of these movements may help to
understand how people are moving across the district today compared to in prior years. By
visualizing these trip links, and in conjunction with an understanding of current utilization
patterns, RTD can refine future SOP recommendations where investments can make the
greatest impact.
As in the prior maps, RTD’s forthcoming SOP recommendations were compiled and overlaid on
the trip pairs (Figure 31). Based on findings identified in the trip links analysis and coverage of
future SOP service, future SOP recommendations can be refined to identify whether these links
are well served.

Refined SOP Recommendations
Since July 2022, RTD has begun implementation of SOP recommendations while establishing
use of a new market-based service classification framework to replace the prior Family of
Services model. Opportunities exist to continue to refine and improve the framework, which
aims to align service levels with travel demand, equity goals, and available resources. While
SOP implementation has begun, it has been phased to account for financial and workforce
limitations, resulting in partial rollouts and necessary deviations from ideal service standards.
The SOP's development, shaped significantly by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, reflects
a flexible, data-driven approach that balances pre-pandemic insights with evolving travel
behavior. RTD remains committed to refining SOP recommendations over time, applying service
improvements strategically, and adapting to emerging patterns and resource conditions.
Additionally, an upcoming Comprehensive Operational Analysis will likely further inform
systemwide planning and ensure continued alignment with regional mobility needs. The
following sections lay out initial SOP implementation and upcoming refined recommendations.

Route Categorization and Changes to Service Classifications

RTD categorizes its services in various ways for different reporting and planning purposes both
for internal and external uses. For service performance, RTD currently categorizes its fixedroute services into five bus-based classes and one rail class with subdivisions. As the SOP is
being phased in, these classes continue to be used for service analysis and reporting, but other
categories are also used in reporting runboard service and transit utilization as well as for
internal summary reports known as Recaps, which include the most divisions and service
reporting (Table 12). As seen with the runboard service analysis, service classes in those
include six bus-based fixed route services and the two rail services.

A key feature of the SOP recommendations was the categorization of routes into a new travel
market-based network of services. This new streamlined classification replaced RTD’s previous
Family of Services classification. New service categories include:

Core

Community

Serve the region’s largest
em ploym ent centers, highest-density
population areas and m ajor trip
generators w ith a dem onstrated
dem and for at least 18 hours of
service, 15-m inute or better peak

Com m unity-focused local routes w ith

travelers)

Local routes w ith a m inim um 14hour span of service (6 a.m . to 8
p.m .)

With these new defined service categories came a definition of service levels, span of service
hours and service days. Upon approval of the SOP recommendations in July 2022, RTD began a
phased implementation of SOP service improvements that were prioritized based on criteria

49

Attachment: System Optimization Plan 2025 Review and Recommendations Report [Revision 1] (5177 : System Optimization Plan – 2025

1.E.2.b

Packet Pg. 755

SOP Review and Recommendations Report
including service need, financial capacity and workforce availability. As noted earlier in this
report, some SOP initiatives were implemented in their entirety while others were partially
implemented (e.g., route alignment but not service frequency or span of service hours). Partial
implementation, although appropriate given the criteria used to prioritize them, does result in
inconsistencies with overall defined service category service parameters (i.e., frequency, span
of service hours and days of service).
Although each new service category’s defined service parameters were meant to create
consistency in the application of service levels by service category across the system, phased
implementation of SOP recommendations provides some challenges. A wholesale
implementation of service parameters across each service category would result in allocating
resources (financial and workforce) to routes and service periods that may not be justified
based on current performance, customer or community demand or within resource availability.
It is for this reason RTD should continue the practice of applying these service category service
parameters only where they are justified and not strictly out of policy.
It is also recognized that some service routes grouped into one of the new service categories
may warrant or justify a change in service category based on performance and route service
area characteristics. RTD should be flexible in allowing a shift in the routes service category as
the system and service area characteristics evolve.

Refinement of SOP recommendations

The SOP, as part of Reimagine RTD, started in late summer 2019. Six months into Reimagine
RTD the COVID-19 pandemic dramatically impacted world events and the direction of the study.
When developing the SOP transit improvement recommendations, conclusions about the future
and how transit should evolve to meet future mobility needs could no longer be drawn from
recent trends. The mobility world had changed!
Despite the challenges of the pandemic, RTD marched forward to identify transit service
improvements for the future. Four SOP service scenarios were developed and designed to meet
specific goals: Service Quality, Social Equity, Service Productivity and Geographic Coverage.
There was no specific preferred scenario. Rather, stakeholders and the Board of Directors
indicated they would like to see elements of each scenario reflected in the SOP. SOP
recommendations prioritize a regionally focused, high-quality transit network that delivers
strong connectivity to equity communities and transit-supportive land use corridors. The
network was developed to reflect financial constraints and travel market demand, considering
both pre-2020 demand, pandemic period demand, and potential future demand. To maximize
service coverage, the SOP encourages partnerships with local agencies to bolster local
connectivity to the regional transit network.
The SOP recommendations include a menu of changes such as route alignments, new service
patterns and different route service patterns (e.g., short, long), service frequencies, span of
service hours, new days and periods of service, and new routes. Many of these improvements
were based on pre-2020 utilization and service productivity, travel patterns, and anticipated
future demand.

Attachment: System Optimization Plan 2025 Review and Recommendations Report [Revision 1] (5177 : System Optimization Plan – 2025

1.E.2.b

Packet Pg. 756

SOP Review and Recommendations Report
Predictions of the future are difficult to make and often wrong. While the development of the
SOP was completed during the pandemic, the post-shock recovery period provided RTD an
opportunity to select improvements and modify those to fit evolving conditions, including
resource availability, the return of utilization demand, and changes in travel patterns. Three
years after approval of the SOP, RTD continues to remain flexible in selecting SOP
recommendations for phased implementation. It is recommended that RTD continue to
scrutinize SOP recommendations based on analysis of travel needs or modify recommendations
entirely to meet current needs. This flexibility should continue to re-examine changes in route
alignments and service levels to ensure they match what is experienced in the environment for
which these improvements are recommended and optimize the resources available for the
highest return. Because RTD regularly plans, develops, evaluates, and measures its operations
to provide maximum value to the larger community, those intervals provide RTD with
opportunities to refine the direction of SOP implementation based on current and forecasted
events.

Continued Phasing of SOP Service Recommendations

The SOP continues to be implemented in phases through each future service change with a
planned full implementation, barring unforeseen impacts, by 2027. The fall 2025 service change
planned for August includes several new recommendations that will be added to the list of
already completed SOP recommendations. The next service changes include original SOP
recommendations but also new service changes based on recent boarding and service
productivity information and currently known corridor travel patterns inferred through the
utilization data.
Additionally, with the forthcoming opening of BRT service along East Colfax Avenue in 2027,
new service changes related to connecting bus routes are required and will be necessary to
include within SOP recommendations as all-new changes. Because service planning for Colfax
BRT was not finalized during development of the SOP, recommendations for the corridor were
made outside of BRT service planning. Major changes will be required due to existing
interactions of corridor routes with Downtown Denver as well as Decatur•Federal Station, where
Route 15L terminates. Potential routes interacting with the corridor and requiring changes may
include Routes 6, 10, 15L, 20 and 43, among others.

Near-Term Recommendations – Three to Four Service Changes

Near-term service changes will have some differentiation from the original recommendations
due to overall changes since they were first created. Table 13 provides a summary of
prospective SOP recommendations for implementation in the next year to year –and a half of
service changes. While RTD has an established process for planning for service changes based
on service standards and service development policy, among various other considerations,
systemwide changes in travel behavior and other factors have altered the conventional
application of service standards. As such, these near-term recommendations are based on a
comparison of pre-2020 and recent route productivities (boardings per trip). Routes
experiencing utilization growth but still lagging pre-2020 utilization and performance were not
considered for near-term implementation. Additionally, service productivity improvements
identified along route alignments were considered for identifying near-term recommendations if
the overall route performance improved above pre-2020 performance. Near-term SOP

recommendations are made without inclusion of crucial factors such as operator availability,
Title VI equity analysis considerations, or financial capacities, among other considerations.

Mid-Term Recommendations

The remaining SOP service recommendations (minus near-term recommendations),
documented in the appendix, should be re-evaluated for inclusion in the mid-term period (next
three to four service changes) based on then-current performance information. RTD may
choose to delay mid-term recommendations and confirm future viability through the completion
of the comprehensive operational analysis. Its findings will likely adjust original
recommendations or find new ones based on public feedback, Board direction, and new data.

Amended SOP Recommendations

Some of the SOP recommendations were amended before implementation and are summarized
in Table 20. SOP recommendations were amended largely to comply with the CBA and for
operational efficiencies:
•
•
•

While the SOP recommends all W Line trips extend to JeffCo Gov’t Center•Golden
Station, several evening trips short turn at Federal Center Station to reduce deadhead
time when returning to the rail yard.
Route 10 was extended to East Metro Division instead of Aurora Plaza, as called for in
the SOP, for compliance with the CBA.
Route 34 was combined with Route 38 for compliance with the CBA.
