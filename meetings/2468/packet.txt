Subject:

State Legislative Liaison Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Government Relations Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the
General Manager, or his designee, to enter into an agreement for state legislative liaison services with
Brandeberry~McKenna Public Affairs (BBMK) to exercise a one-year option (June 30, 2016 through
June 29, 2017) to extend Contract No. 13-DX-00, at a cost of $122,000, pursuant to the Contract
Award agreement.
BACKGROUND
Contract 13-DX-001 for State Legislative Liaison Services was signed with Brandeberry~McKenna
Public Affairs, effective July 1, 2013, and contained a provision for four (4) additional one-year option
periods. This board action would exercise the option for Year 3 of the option years. Of extreme
importance, the lobbyists are in daily contact with state legislators regarding bills that RTD seeks to have
passed, as well as regarding bills that would be harmful to RTD.
DISCUSSION
The state lobbying team provides guidance and direction for the RTD Board of Directors and staff in
their relationships with the General Assembly members. Constant monitoring of the activities within
the General Assembly and the Executive Office of the state of Colorado is required, and RTD’s
interests must be conveyed to appropriate legislators, including testifying before certain committees.
Advice and assistance in drafting legislation are also provided by the lobbying team. When RTD has
had legislation before the General Assembly, Brandeberry~McKenna has an excellent record of
making certain that these bills pass and become part of the Colorado statutes.
As part of the services, frequent contact is made with RTD staff and board members regarding various
bills in the legislature; written summary reports are issued on a weekly basis during the legislative
session; and status reports are given at the Government Relations Committee meetings while the
General Assembly is in session and as deemed necessary thereafter.
The Brandeberry~McKenna team also takes the initiative to educate state legislators on RTD issues and
projects so that these legislators understand mass transit and RTD’s mission.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Approve the Recommended Action. It is recommended by RTD’s Government Relations Committee
that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to enter into an agreement for state
legislative liaison services with Brandeberry~McKenna Public Affairs (BBMK) to exercise a one-year
option (June 30, 2016 through June 29, 2017) to extend Contract No. 13-DX-001, at a cost of
$122,000, pursuant to the Contract Award agreement.
2. Do not approve the Recommended Action.
Do not accept the recommendation by the
Government Relations Committee that authorizes the General Manager to enter into a contract to
execute the state legislative liaison services one-year option agreement. A new Request for

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

Proposals could be sent to interested parties, interviews conducted, and a different state lobbying
firm could possibly be selected by the Government Relations Committee and retained. This action
is not recommended because it is the consensus of the Government Relations Committee to
recommend to the Board the selection of the Brandeberry~McKenna team.
3. Do not approve the Recommended Action. Do not retain the services of a state legislative liaison
firm. This action is not recommended because it would put RTD in the position of facing
contentious and potentially harmful legislative issues with no direct legislative liaison services. It
was determined by the Government Relations Committee that the Brandeberry~McKenna team
has been very effective in pursuing the RTD state legislative agenda and will continue to
represent RTD’s interests very well in the future. This team is very familiar with RTD’s issues
and policies.

Local Government Relations Update

The following are items for May 10, 2016:
1. CCA Transportation Funding Proposals – As you may recall, the Colorado Contractors
Association, Associated General Contractors of Colorado, the Colorado Construction
Industry Coalition and Move Colorado submitted 10 ballot initiatives on March 25. Each
measure include language to exempt the money from TABOR; nine measures seek to
raise the Transportation Safety Sales Tax at the rate .0062% and one measure has a
$0.003 sales tax increase. The money would be deposited into the Highway Users Trust
Fund (HUTF) and would be directed for state and local road, bridge and transportation
projects that address safety and congestion. All measures include language to exempt the
money from TABOR.
The Metro Mayors Caucus held a special work session on May 2 to discuss the measures.
The MMC has not taken a formal position, but the mayors in attendance were unanimous
in their opposition to moving forward with any of the proposed ballot measures as
currently written, citing three primary concerns:
 Lack of funds dedicated to transit
 Concern the statewide tax increase could preclude cities from raising local sales
taxes for needed infrastructure
 The inequitable distribution of funds raised; metro region cities would account for
nearly 55% of overall revenue but receive only 11% back.
The CCA is conducting additional polling this week and is expected to make a final on
which, if any, of the 10 measures to move forward in the next week or so. Attached are
handouts from meeting.
2. CML and CCI Summer Conferences – The Colorado Municipal League (CML) will hold

its summer conference June 21-24. The Colorado Counties Inc. (CCI) conference is June
6-8.

Re:

Update

SB16-194 Regional Transportation Development Projects sponsored by Senator Scott and Reps.
Moreno and DelGrosso passed the Senate Transportation Committee. The bill creates the
“Regional Transportation Development Act,” which allows a city, county, town or local
government to apply to the state transportation commission for approval of a regional
transportation development project. The bill has been introduced in previous years and is an
issue that the City of Broomfield is behind. SB194 as written would not take any funds from the
District. It allows creation of new “authorities” to build highway or transit projects. These
authorities could be within the district but the funding is state sales tax increment finance, plus
what other public bodies would want to contribute.
BBMK is expecting the re-introduction of last year’s SB15-272 Authorize New Transportation
Revenue Anticipation Notes (TRANs) Bonds. The bill titled the “Fix Colorado Roads Act” is
sponsored by Senator Baumgardner and Minority Leader DelGrosso. The bill would replace the
228 funding mechanism with General Funds for transportation by directing $160M+ annual
transfer (equal to 5% of state sales tax revenue) to the State Highway Fund and $32M+ (equal to
1% of state sales tax revenue) to the Capital Construction Fund. The bill also authorizes $3.5
Million in bonding capacity for state transportation projects and directs the Transportation
Commission to allocate funds as necessary to meet the obligation of the annual payment. $150M
of the $160M in General Funds would be combined with $100M in CDOT funds to support the
$250M annual bond payment with the remaining funds available for Asset Management,
Operations and Maintenance. The bill will also allow the Transportation Commission to decide
when to put the referred question before the voters (2016, 2017, or 2018). Lastly the bill will
define 50+ highway and transit projects throughout the state of Colorado and aligns precisely
with the projects on CDOT’s most recently revised list of priority projects, referred to as the 228
list.
HB16-1186 MAP-21 Rail fixed Guideway Safety Fund Grant Match sponsored by Rep. Tyler
and Senator Baumgardner passed the Senate on Second Reading. Current law requires 3% of the
fixed utilities fund (FUF) to be sent to the general fund. HB16-1186 proposes diverting up to
$150,000 from the transfer in order to fulfill the 20% match required by MAP21. RTD is
monitoring this bill.
HB16-1304 Transportation Priorities Community Conversations sponsored by Rep. Tyler is
scheduled for a hearing in the Senate State Veterans and Military Affairs Committee on
Wednesday at 1:30pm. The bill requires CDOT to hold at least one community conversation in
each transportation planning region of the state no later than Oct 1, 2016 in order to allow

HB16-1273 Authorize Parking Fees at CDOT Parking Facilities sponsored by Rep. Arndt was
postponed indefinitely in the Senate State Affairs Committee. The bill would authorize CDOT
to charge fees for parking at a park-n-ride lot or any other CDOT parking facility for more than
24 hours or in a reserved parking space. BBMK is monitoring this legislation. The bill was
amended on Second Reading in the House to limit the bill to a park and ride lot in Fort
Collins and to adjust the fees CDOT could charge.
BBMK has been monitoring the transportation funding related ballot proposals for 2016. A total
of 10 ballot titles have been submitted. All measures except for Initiative #155 seek to raise at
least $640 million in the first full year through a Transportation Safety Sales tax at the rate of 6.2
cents on a $10 dollar purchase subject to the state’s sales and use tax. In all versions that include
a HUTF distribution to counties and cities, each local agency is permitted under current state law
to use the funds for roadway or transit projects.

members of the public to be questioned regarding their top priorities for transportation funding
and their preferred means of raising the revenue needed to fund those priorities. BBMK will
monitor this legislation.

FEDERAL UPDATE FOR REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT: MAY 10, 2016
Senate Makes Progress on FY 2017 Transportation/HUD Appropriations Legislation:


On April 21, the Senate Appropriations Committee reported out its fiscal year 2017
spending bill for the Department of Transportation and the Department of Housing and
Urban Development. Committee members agreed to abstain from offering controversial
amendments until the bill is considered on the Senate floor, so the measure was adopted
by a 30 to 0 vote.



This figure includes the $199 million authorized for FY 2017 for positive
train control grants to commuter and intercity passenger railroads.

o Capital Investment Grants (New Starts): The bill slightly exceeds the FAST Act
authorization level for New Starts, providing $2.338 billion (increase over FY
2016 enacted level of $2.117 billion and higher than FAST Act level of $2.302
billion).


The bill provides $150 million for the Eagle P3 FFGA, the same amount
provided in FY 2016, but less than the $167 million RTD requested.

o TIGER: The bill also increases funding for the extremely popular TIGER grant
program, providing $525 million (increase over FY 2016 enacted level of $500
million), but would decrease the maximum grant size from $100 million down to
$25 million.


Next Steps in the Senate: the Transportation/HUD bill, likely combined with the
Military Construction bill, will be the next appropriations legislation considered on the
Senate floor during the week of May 9.

Appropriations Action in the House Lags Behind the Senate:


The House has not yet introduced its Transportation/HUD spending bill for fiscal year
2017.



No House Budget Resolution: House leadership has been unable to reach agreement
with conservative House Republicans that are pushing for a top-line budget number
below the $1.07 trillion level agreed to by Senator McConnell, then-Speaker Boehner, and
President Obama in their two-year budget deal reached last year. In the absence of a
formal budget resolution, the House Appropriations Committee has advanced 3 of the 12
annual spending bills through committee, but no appropriations bills have come to the
House floor.

US DOT’s Innovative Finance Office Showcases Eagle P3 Project:


On May 11, US DOT will host a webinar on the finance plan and project development
approaches RTD and its partners have used to advance the Eagle P3 project, focusing on
RTD’s use of an availability payment P3 structure. Dave Genova will participate in the
webinar.

o Transit Formula Programs: The Committee’s bill honors the FAST Act
authorization levels for transit formula programs funded from the Highway Trust
Fund: $9.7 billion ($386 million over FY 2016 enacted level).
