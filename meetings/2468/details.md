#### 1. State Legislative Liaison Services

It is recommended by the Government Relations Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into an agreement for state legislative liaison services with Brandeberry~McKenna Public Affairs (BBMK) to exercise a one-year option (June 30, 2016 through June 29, 2017) to extend Contract No. 13-DX-00, at a cost of $122,000, pursuant to the Contract Award agreement.

Motion:              Chair Tobiassen made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the May 31, 2016 Board Meeting.

Director Solano seconded the motion.

Discussion:                Sherry Ellebracht, Government Relations officer, stated that the team at Brandeberry~McKenna Public Affairs (BBMK) does a fantastic job representing RTD at the State Capitol.  BBMK has a proven record at being very effective in ensuring the bills RTD needs are passed.  She noted that included in the May 10, 2015 Government Relations Committee Agenda Packet there was a summary report from BBMK outlining all the work they have done over the years for RTD.  She does not think it is as comprehensive as what BBMK actually does but provides a good overview.  She encouraged the Board renew the contract with BBMK.

Jenifer Brandeberry, BBMK, stated that the BBMK team looks forward to continuing to represent RTD before the General Assembly.  She said it has been an honor to represent RTD and something her staff take a lot of pride in.  She believes the partnership they have had with RTD staff and Board members has allowed BBMK to have a great amount of success at the State Capital.

Director Lubow expressed her gratitude to the staff of BBMK for the work they have done on behalf of RTD.  She said it has been a pleasure working with them.

Committee Vice-Chair Francone shared that she has enjoyed working closely with the staff at BBMK.  She recognized how well they keep the Board posted on upcoming legislation.  She said their hard work is much appreciated.  BBMK is always very well prepared and look out for RTD’s interests.  She also thanked Sherry Ellebracht for her diligence.

Committee Vice-Chair Francone declared the motion PASSED.

#### 1. Local Update - CRL Associates

Sherry Ellebracht, Government Relations Officer, apologized on behalf of Roger Sherman for his absence as he was traveling.  She indicated that the report was included in the May 10, 2016 Government Relations Committee Agenda Packet.  She said she also sent additional information in relation to the various Colorado contractor group’s funding proposals.

Sherry Ellebracht stated Colorado Contractors Association, Associated General Contractors of Colorado, the Colorado Construction Industry Coalition, and Move Colorado (contractor groups) submitted ten (10) ballot initiative titles.  The contractor groups will now have to decide which one of these they will actually take to a ballot election in November, 2016, if any.  Sherry Ellebracht indicated that the Metro Mayors Caucus (MMC) did not take a formal position; however, at the work session held on May 2 the consensus was not to support any of the proposals as currently written.  The three primary concerns cited for the MMC’s decision are:

- Lack of funds dedicated to transit

- Concern the statewide tax increase could preclude cities from raising local sales taxes for needed infrastructure

- The inequitable distribution of funds

The Metro Mayors Caucus (MMC) was very adamant that transit needed to be funded, which is a positive for RTD.  Staff will continue to monitor the progress of the ballot initiatives as they move forward.  Jenifer Brandeberry added that they will know soon how the ballot will look.  She said there had been several transportation funding bills that died and there has been frustration with the lack of ability to pass anything at the State level to fund transportation.  She indicated the contractor groups would need to do polling to determine what is passable and will garner enough revenue to make it worthwhile.

Director Lubow wondered if the contractor groups would move forward without an endorsement from the MMC.  Sherry Ellebracht responded that it will depend on the polling and the level of support they see.  As it is a sales tax and not something like a gas tax, the polling results may show some push back.  She said it also depends on who will be willing to fund a campaign that could cost millions of dollars for something that might not be very popular.

Director Anderson thinks one of the good reasons that the MMC have refused to look at this initiative is because it would preempt local governments from raising sales tax on their own for transportation purposes.  In the city of Arvada there are some transportation needs that cannot be met under the State and the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) money.  If the contractor group’s initiative passes, then it would preempt the cities from having their own sales tax for transportation needs.  Sherry Ellebracht agreed that Director Anderson makes a good point as some of these cities were very concerned with an additional sales tax that would be bumping up taxes close to 10% in their communities.  Some of the cities would like to do their own local ballot for funding transportation and once you get to a 10% sales tax that is pretty steep.

##### a. CRL LGR Report 05-10-16

#### 2. State Update - Brandeberry - McKenna

Jenifer Brandeberry expressed that the end of the legislative session is about thirty (30) hours away.  She said she is happy to report that RTD will finish up the session in very fine shape.  She wanted to focus on three highlights that Brandeberry~McKenna Public Affairs (BBMK) have spent a lot of time on for RTD this year:

- House Bill 16-1008 was passed allowing RTD to operate buses along the shoulder of US 36.

- Senate Bill 16-123 dealt with the requirement of transponders for High Occupancy Vehicles to use the US 36 express lanes that morphed into a larger conversation about the High Performance Enterprise (HPTE) and public/private partnerships.  This bill died in the House Transportation Committee.

- House Bill 16-1325 would have required CDOT to post information about caucus and election dates on variable message signs.  When it became clear that they were statutorily prohibited from doing that there was an amendment quickly offered that would have required RTD to post the messaging.  This bill died after quick action by RTD staff and Directors after explaining how it would be cost prohibitive.

Julie McKenna, BBMK, shared with the Board information on Senate Bill 16-194, which was introduced by the City of Broomfield and has now been passed in the Senate Transportation Committee.  The bill creates the “Regional Transportation Development Act,” which allows a city, county, town or local government to apply to the state transportation commission for approval of a regional transportation development project.  SB16-194 as written would not take any funds from RTD.  It allows creation of new “authorities” to build highway or transit projects.  These authorities could be within the District but the funding is state sales tax increment finance, plus what other public bodies would want to contribute.  She said this bill did die but will probably continue to be discussed.

Julie McKenna indicated that affordable housing and construction defects continued to be an important topic but there were a number of bills that did not go forward; however, these are topics that are not going away.  She said there are still several big issues that are percolating that BBMK will continue to monitor.  As they stand they do not impact RTD but it is important to monitor if any amendments are made.

Julie McKenna thanked the Board for renewing BBMK’s contract.  She said it has been an honor to represent RTD.

##### a. RTD Update 5 2

#### 3. Federal Update - Squire Patton Boggs

Mike Dino, Squire Patton Boggs, shared that congress resumed their session earlier today whereas the Senate resumed last night. There are approximately 3 weeks before the Memorial Day holiday break.   He noted they will be working throughout the summer; however, due to the Presidential campaigns productivity might suffer.  He said over the next three weeks the Senate and House will try to get a budget and appropriations passed.  The Senate has passed their transportation appropriations and kept most programs at current funding levels or higher.  One of the things they have improved upon is the Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) grant program.  Mike Dino noted the Senate appropriations also funded the New Starts Grant and allocated $150 million for the Eagle P3 project.  He indicated RTD asked for $167 million to make-up from a previous year shortfall, which we will eventually get.  He pointed out that $199 million was authorized for positive train control grants which might present some opportunities for RTD.

Mike Dino commented that RTD will be submitting a Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) grant proposal in the range of $13 million for the state of good repair and operational improvements for the Central corridor.  He noted that Directors briefed the delegation on this during the APTA Legislative Conference.

Mike Dino shared that General Manager Genova will be participating in a US Department of Transportation (DOT) webinar on the finance plan and project development for the Eagle P3 project. He also shared that last week Director Francone General Manager Genova and he went out to the National Renewable Energy Labs (NREL) to talk about the Department of Commerce’s i6 Challenge Grant.  This grant is concentrated on regional innovation strategies that bring different groups together and focuses on economic development, jobs and business opportunities.  The meeting was to discuss strategies to partner with NREL and other businesses that may be eligible for this grant.

Director Menten asked about receiving a copy of the TIGER grant application for $13 million.  She wondered if it would include specifics of what the funds would cover. General Manager Genova responded that he would forward a copy to Director Menten.  He explained that the application would detail the state of good repair work and installing a pocket track that would be part of the Central Rail extension.

Committee Vice-Chair Francone thanked Mike Dino for accompanying General Manager Genova and herself to the NREL meeting.  She thinks the i6 Grant is an opportunity for RTD to pursue a revenue stream in the future.  Mike Dino added that the NREL tour they took of the Research and Development facility highlighted advantages to renewable energy or alternative energy modes that could be advantageous to RTD.

##### a. Federal Update 5 10 2016

### D. Other Matters

Director Bagley shared that he was late this evening as he attended a going away reception for Jim Gunning, Mayor of Lone Tree.  Director Bagley has worked alongside Mayor Gunning for the last seven and half years and at one time had pieces of Lone Tree in his District.  He said he has requested that General Manager Genova write a letter congratulating him on his eight year term.  Director Bagley referred to Mayor Gunning as being a leader of the Metro Mayors Caucus and a champion of the Southeast corridor extension.

Director Bagley added that he and Chair Tobiassen attended the State of Downtown Denver Event today that was hosted by the Downtown Denver Partnership, Inc. Director Bagley requested the Board members read the 2016 State of Downtown Denver Report. He thinks it is important to understand that the health of Denver makes everything else viable.  This report is a fantastic summary of extraordinary developments that have been happening in Denver that benefit the entire region. Director Bagley further added that although he did not attend the University of Colorado A Line inaugural ride, he did attend the reception before the official public opening.  Director Bagley congratulated all the staff and said it has been a fantastic opportunity for the members of the Board to be involved with the entire Eagle P3 project.  He noted three Board members, Director Bill James, Chair Tom Tobiassen and himself, have been here for the entire project. This FasTracks project is what makes this area one of the top regions in the entire country.

Director Lasater complimented General Manager Genova for how he handled the hecklers during his speech at the University of Colorado A Line opening.  The hecklers made a disruptive scene but General Manager Genova kept his composure and continued on with his speech.  Director Lasater also shared that he had attended the groundbreaking for the Southeast Rail extension and it was well attended.  Construction will start on May 16th and hopefully the extension will be opened at the proposed March 2019 timeframe.

Director Bagley noted there had been a shakeup at APTA with Michael Melaniphy stepping down as President and CEO after the Metropolitan Transit Agency of New York cancelled their APTA membership.  He asked General Manager Genova if he could speak about what has been happening.  General Manager Genova responded that for the last few years New York City’s MTA was making rumblings about pulling out of APTA. Their main reason being that agency dues are determined by how large the agency is and their dues were around $400,000 a year.  MTA felt that the representation they received was not worth the financial contribution.  Shortly after it was announced that MTA was no longer going to be a part of APTA, Michael Melaniphy resigned.  General Manager Genova recognized that APTA is currently in the process of making changes, but he does not know what those changes will be. He added that APTA continues to be a great body for RTD and the transportation industry as a whole. He believes they provide a valuable service and are a good organization and he is interested to see what direction they take the agency to next.

Director Anderson stated that she had attended the APTA Board Meeting prior to the Transit Board Member Seminar in San Antonio.  She said she is looking forward to renewed efforts on the part of APTA and its many different members to continue to make it a valuable agency to represent all of the transit associations throughout the whole of the United States.

Committee Vice-Chair Francone thanked Director Bagley for representing RTD at Mayor Gunning’s farewell.
