Recommended Action
Legislative Committee Chair Director Daly presented this item before the
Executive Committee. He shared that an ad-hoc committee consisting of
himself, Director Pulliam, Director Jack O’Boyle and Director Tobiassen had
reviewed the bids for the Federal Legislative Liaison Services. It was a
unanimous decision by this ad-hoc committee to recommended Patton Boggs
for this contract. Patton Boggs is the current vendor who has done an
excellent job representing RTD in Washington. Given the Full Funding Grant
Agreement and other critical items affecting RTD, the continuity of having
someone who understands the RTD issues and can represent our needs is
fundamental to our process.
Motion:

Director Busck made the motion to move the
action item forward for the Federal Liaison
Services to the full Board for a vote on
December 15, 2009.
Chair Kemp seconded the motion.

Vote on
the Motion:

The Motion PASSED unanimously.

December Board Meeting Review
Phil Washington, Interim General Manager, reviewed the Board agenda for the
December meeting. He noted a large number of retirees which depending
upon their attendance at the Board meeting we may want to give
consideration to recognizing them as a group rather than individually. He
expressed some of these retirees could be the fallout from the arbitration
ruling.
Director Daly asked about the process used to make changes to the Salaried
Employee Insured Benefits. Phil Washington explained these changes were
relayed to the employees, several one-on-ones were held but this decision was
made by the staff under his direction to save money and come back with
some better options. The District will save approximately $500,000.
Directors Martinez and Busck shared this was common practice at their place
of employment also.

Director Busck made the motion to move the
December Board agenda forward to the
December 15th Board meeting for a full Board
vote.

Motion:

Director Tayer seconded the motion.
Vote on
the Motion:
