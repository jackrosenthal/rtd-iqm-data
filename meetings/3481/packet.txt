BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Proposed Debt Modifications

June 7, 2023

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
Brenden Morgan, Senior Manager, Debt and Investments
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD primarily utilizes sales tax bonds and certificates of participation (COPs), when necessary, as
financing mechanisms to provide funding for certain purchases of assets with useful lives in excess of
one year. Sales tax bonds are subject to Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TABOR) limitations, and debt service
payments are secured by future collections of sales and use taxes. COPs are lease-purchase
arrangements and are not subject to TABOR limitations; however, COPs require annual appropriation by
the Board through the budgeting process to authorize annual principal and interest payments. COPs are
secured through the collateralization of the underlying asset that was financed. Bonds and COPs are
referred to as RTD debt for discussion purposes.
All of RTD’s debt has fixed interest rates, meaning that the interest rate paid on the portfolio of debt
does not vary with market changes. In addition, RTD’s debt has fixed terms of maturity and is not
subject to acceleration, meaning that all debt payments will occur on a fixed schedule through the term
of each obligation. These features provide budget certainty as well as limit RTD’s interest rate risk.
RTD’s debt portfolio contains obligations that are either taxable or tax-exempt. Taxable debt results in
interest payments to debt holders being subject to taxable income while tax-exempt debt is generally
non-taxable. Taxable debt generally has a higher cost to RTD than tax-exempt debt due to the difference
in interest rates at the time of issuance. Taxable debt is issued instead of tax-exempt debt in situations
that are advantageous to RTD but do not meet the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requirements to be
issued as tax-exempt.
As of December 31, 2022, RTD’s total outstanding bonds and COPs totaled $2.991 billion.
DISCUSSION
Staff and its municipal advisor, Hilltop Securities, constantly monitor market conditions for opportunities
for efficiencies regarding RTD’s finances. Current market conditions for debt indicate opportunities to
take advantage of low interest rates and differences between taxable and tax-exempt rates for future
interest cost savings as well as potential advantages from issuing new borrowings.

1.E.1

Two opportunities are available to modify RTD’s debt that will contribute to the Strategic Priority of
Financial Success:
1. Issuance of COPs Series 2023A
a. Refinance COPs Series 2013A after the June 1, 2023 call date for potential gross interest
savings of $26.7 million or a net present value of $2.6 million or 3.7%.
b. Borrow additional funding for planned capital purchases to preserve cash for higher
investment returns. The amount to borrow is being determined and will be presented to
the Board for its consideration during the July 2023 meeting cycle.
2. Issuance of tax-exempt FasTracks Sales Tax Bonds Series 2023A
a. Fund the tender/purchase of outstanding taxable FasTracks Sales Tax Bonds Series 2019A
and 2021A for potential gross interest savings of $74.6 million or a net present value of
$7.0 million or 9.4%, assuming a 20% participation rate. If approved by the Board, RTD
would solicit current bond holders to sell their bonds to RTD with the agency having the
option to cancel the transaction if an adequate level of participation does not occur.
Parties to this transaction are working on a contingent fee basis, which would result in
little to no cost to RTD if the transaction is cancelled.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Based on market interest rates in April 2023, the COP Series 2023A transaction could generate gross
interest savings of $26.7 million, and the Bond Series 2023A transaction could generate gross interest
savings of $74.6 million. In addition, utilizing new borrowings for capital purchases, rather than utilizing
cash, could generate additional investment income of 1.0-1.5% on amounts borrowed.
