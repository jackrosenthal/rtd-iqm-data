Subject:

Designation of Finalist Candidates for the
General Manager Position

Executive

Manager,

GM
Board Meeting Date: August 7, 2020

RECOMMENDED ACTION
The General Manager Executive Search/Oversight & Performance Management Committee (Committee)
presents to the Board a motion to approve as finalists for the General Manager position the following
individuals identified by the Committee:
Debra Johnson
Adelee Le Grand
Tina Quigley
BACKGROUND
Following the departure of David Genova from his position as General Manager in February 2020, the
Board engaged in a robust search process and selected Paul J. Ballard to serve as the interim General
Manager until such time the Board could select a person to perform the role on an ongoing basis.
Following a nationwide search, the Committee, in consultation with the executive search firm
Krauthamer & Associates, reviewed application materials from 19 individuals representing a wide degree
of backgrounds and experiences. In the meeting held on Wednesday, July 22, 2020, the Committee
selected seven individuals to move forward as preliminary candidates for the position, one of whom
would later withdraw from consideration.
The Committee, while convened in executive session during Committee meetings held on August 5 and
6, 2020, interviewed the six preliminary candidates in order to identify the individuals who should move
forward in the process as “finalists”, as that term is defined in CRS §24-6-402 (3.5).
DISCUSSION
In adopting this Recommended Action, the Board of Directors is designating finalist candidates for the
position of General Manager from the pool of preliminary candidates. Following outreach efforts aimed at
gathering feedback from RTD’s employees, constituents, and key stakeholders regarding the candidates,
a second round of interviews is scheduled for the finalist candidates on August 19 and 20, 2020.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact related to the selection of the finalist candidates.
