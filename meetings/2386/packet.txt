Proposed 2016 Internal Audit Plan

Discussion

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approves the proposed plan of internal audits to be performed in 2016.
BACKGROUND
The annual internal audit plan has historically been approved by the General Manager. As a result of the
State of Colorado examination, it was agreed that the Board of Directors would also approve the internal
audit plan.
DISCUSSION
The attached plan includes the calculated number of days available for auditing, as well as the audit plan
and an estimate of the days allocated for each audit. A total of twenty (20) audits are planned including
IT audits. Due to budget constraints, there are no outside audits scheduled for this year.
The plan is based on estimates of the time required to complete the audits. As in past years, it utilizes
every available business day. If other audits arise during the year, we will request the input of the Board
as to which audits are to be eliminated to accommodate the added audit/audits.
FINANCIAL IMPACT

This will allow the

Do not approve the proposed plan. This is not recommended. The plan was developed including
input from numerous sources throughout the District and also includes the audits annually
required by the Board. Delaying the start of audit work will limit the days available for fieldwork
and could require a reduction in overall audit presence in the District.

DISCUSSION
Attached is the Performance Report for the Third Quarter of 2015. These year-to-date measures
provide a framework in which RTD determines how well it provides service to its passengers and
the citizens of the District within its mission statement objectives. Of the 23 performance
measures tracked, RTD met 17 of the goals in their entirety in the third quarter vs. 19 in the
second quarter. The following is a discussion of the exceptions.
Goal 1.1 – Safety Incidents
First Transit-Commerce City was the only carrier to not meet goal in Q3 in the passenger accident
ratio per 100,000 miles. All of the passenger accidents were non-preventable.
Goal 3.1 – System-Wide On-Time Performance
The District as a whole did not meet its goals for on-time service in Q3; performance is slightly
lower and essentially stable from Q2. In Local on-time service, all carriers met goal except RTD
Local and First Transit-Commerce City. Regional & Express on-time service showed the most
decline from Q2. Staff will continue its targeted efforts in studying the worst performing routes
and identifying the resources needed to improve, such as service changes and further operator
training.
Light Rail on-time service showed a slight improvement over Q2 and exceeded goal.
Goal 4.2 – Level of Customer Complaints
There was virtually no change to this measurement in Q3 from Q2. Overall system complaints
met goal, but individually, three carriers did not. We have seen customer complaints increase
across the entire system over the past 2-3 years due to several factors including the fare
enforcement campaign, the stroller policy, heavy/longer load times, TIC availability, SmartCards,
and the addition of West Line. Staff continues to review CAD/AVL playbacks to determine the
validity of these complaints and to work with operators to address the valid issues.
In Q3, RTD and First Transit-Longmont met or exceeded goal while First Transit-Commerce City,
Transdev and First Transit-Denver did not meet goal. Staff provides an analysis of complaints as
part of the Operations/Customer Services report.
5.1 – ADA On-Time Performance

Packet Pg. 15

1.C.1

Access-a-Ride on-time service was only slightly down from goal of 96.0% in Q3, mostly due to
challenges in operator hiring.
Goal 6.2 – Increase Ridership
Ridership in Q3 is only slightly below goal by less than 1%. Ridership goal is 0% increase for
2015. Ridership actuals compared to budget will continue to be evaluated.
Goal 6.5 – Bus Operator/Mechanic Headcount within Authorization
RTD exceeded its vacancies goal in bus operators and bus mechanics. We are experiencing a high level
of vacancies in this category and recruitment is on-going. Human Resources has revised its hiring
practices to include signing and referral bonuses, “one-stop” job fairs, the use of outside agencies, and
advertising. Vacancies are due to retirements, system growth, and the strong local economy.

The measure is changed in 2015 from Initial Response and Final Resolution to Average Cycle Time, which will measure the
average number of days between when a customer contact is entered for action and when the action is completed (closed). The
categories are also added for 2015.

We continue to experience a static higher level of complaints due to the stroller/wheelchair policy, fare enforcement campaign,
TIC availability, introduction of SmartCards, and the addition of West Line.

practices have been implemented, including signing and referral bonuses, “one-stop” job fairs, community/veteran/education job fairs,

(1) The majority of debt interest payments occur on December 1st therefore variance will correct by year end
(2) Increase due to drawing funds from the TIFIA loan (TIFIA loan of $280m has been fully drawn) and issuance of 2015 COPs.
(3) Increase is due to funds being set aside for semi-annual debt service payments
(4) Variance is due to a timing difference between construction expenditures and bond and COP draws. Bond and COP draws will replenish this by year-end.
(5) Increase is due to the increase to fund balances per the 2015 amended budget
(6) Decrease will be replenished with draws on Bond and COP project funds at year-end

SALARIED EMPLOYEES POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AUDIT
HUMAN RESOURCES DIVISION
REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
AUDIT REPORT #15-01-03

BACKGROUND SUMMARY
There have been several iterations of the Salaried Employees Policies and Procedures between
2006 and 2015. They became less specific containing less detail and were changed frequently
without Management or staff knowledge. The “Employee Guidelines” depended on Human
Resources interpretation more and more in recent years. In addition the Guidelines were in
several parts including:







Part 1 – General Guidelines applicable to all employees,
Part 2 – Guidelines for Salaries Employees.
Procedures Manual
Compensation Manual
Total Rewards Binder and
Several HR forms on the HUB also contain procedures.
SCOPE

The scope included review of the policies and procedures that relate to Salaried Employees.
This involved reviewing previous versions of the policies and procedures and those relating to
Represented Employees for comparison purposes.
OBJECTIVE
The objective of the audit was to review the policies and procedures for Salaried Employees
and determine whether they were comprehensive, relevant, fair to all employees, accessible,
and included all relevant sections.
METHODOLOGY
The methodology used to accomplish the objectives of the audit included but were not limited to
the following:
1. Obtained and reviewed the policies and procedures for Salaried Employees including
older versions as necessary.
2. Obtained and reviewed the policies and procedures for Represented Employees.
3. Interviewed staff to provide further information where needed.

CONCLUSION
The current “guidelines” for salaried employees are not comprehensive. They are located in
several different manuals and forms, and there is inconsistency in topics. The guidelines are not
up to date, and where they are, management and staff are not informed of the changes. There
is no evidence of segregation of duties between writing, reviewing, authorization and approval of

Packet Pg. 44

Attachment: FAAC December 2015 (3rd Quarter 2015) with attachments (2626 : Third Quarter 2015 Internal Audit Report)

1.C.3.a

the Guidelines. In many areas, the guidelines provide no direction and no specific policy
information. Employee guidelines do not encourage, support or facilitate accountability and they
do not accommodate the identification of violations. They are deficient in internal controls and
prepared on an adhoc basis - when policies and procedures were requested by Internal Audit
they were written by HR staff and presented to Internal Audit.
Internal Audit’s concludes that RTD should review and revise the current “Guidelines” as soon
as possible. Policies and procedures should be developed and implemented that would provide
clear policy and direction in the form of comprehensive written procedures. The policies and
procedures should include clear lines of authority and responsibility involving the General
Manager and CEO, and the Senior Leadership Team. The policies and procedures should be
formally reviewed and approved by the General Manager and the Senior Leadership Team.
Updates and changes to the policies and procedures should be actively communicates to staff.
Written policies and procedures should enable the users (management and staff) to understand
their roles and the actions available to them. They should facilitate continuity and comparison of
actions taken by management in similar situations. In addition, the policies and procedures
should accommodate the identification of violations and provide consequences for violations.
Policies and procedures dictate how the organization will function; they provide the methods for
conducting business and support the purpose and mission of the organization. Policies and
procedures should be developed with this in mind.
CURRENT STATUS
The CFO and AGM Finance and Administration has been working diligently to develop
comprehensive policies and procedures. The policies and procedures will be available for
review by Management early in 2016. Internal Audit will follow-up, to ensure they contain
sufficient internal controls and are applied as prescribed.

BACKGROUND SUMMARY
Per the RTD “Adopted Budget 2015”, there are eleven Departments, with numerous Divisions
included within those Departments. Each Division generates their own expense budget for the
year. Total ‘Non-Bus’ and ‘Non-LRT’ Operating Expenses, per the approved 2015 Adopted
Budget, are approximately $206 million.
The annual budget process generally starts late in the 2nd quarter of the current year, in
preparation for the next calendar year. The complete RTD budget is expected to be finalized
during the 4th quarter, and is submitted to the Board of Directors for approval.
AUDIT SCOPE
The audit concentrated on the preparation and ongoing monitoring of Non-Bus and Non-LRT
expense budgets within RTD. Internal Audit utilized the approved 2015 budget package for
review and testing.
CONCLUSION
Management will provide additional training for various RTD department personnel to
understand how to efficiently access their YTD Budget vs. Actual Expense spreadsheet, and
how to research General Ledger activity in Oracle to validate the propriety of recorded
expenses. In addition, budget employees within the Finance Division, will ensure that ‘variance
analyses’ are distributed to appropriate individuals in a timely and consistent manner after each
quarter end.
CURRENT STATUS
Mutually agreed upon corrective action is underway and will be subject to our normal Audit
follow-up review.

AUDIT REPORT # 15-06-10

REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
SMART MEDIA TECHNOLOGY PROJECT
SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE REVIEW
2015 INTERIM AUDIT REPORT # 15-10-05
BACKGROUND SUMMARY
RTD has elected to implement the Smart Media Technology (SMT) system on its buses, and
train platforms using a ‘phased in’ approach. Affiliated Computer Services, a firm purchased by
Xerox with previous expertise in developing such systems, has been working with RTD since
2011 to implement all aspects of this project. The RTD Board approved a contract increase with
Xerox Transport Solutions in 2014, which raised the estimated external project cost to $19.7
million. This increase also included required equipment for new Light Rail (LRT) and Commuter
Rail platforms, related to planned system expansion in 2016.
Since 2013, efforts have concentrated on developing a system that will allow passengers to
purchase credit as ‘stored value’ on their Smart Card, which will then be reduced when the card
holder ‘taps on’ to ride an RTD bus or Rail vehicle. Security Officers will be utilized to
periodically test LRT riders’ cards to verify that they have ‘tapped on’ and have not exceeded
their ‘paid-for’ trip length. Stored Value capability was planned for mid-2014, but later postponed
until August 2015. However, implementation of Stored Value has now been delayed until 2016.
AUDIT SCOPE
Utilizing a System Development Life Cycle approach, our participation in 2015 has continued to
include a review of the development procedures being used to build a system that will satisfy
the needs of the District. Internal Audit has also monitored activities to ensure new capabilities
are adequately tested in advance of moving into a live, full production environment.
CONCLUSION
During 2015, the RTD Project Team has continued to work with Xerox in an effort to develop the
electronic fare media system that was originally anticipated. However, as noted above,
problems and setbacks have been experienced and the goal to ‘go live’ with Stored Value
capability has now been postponed until 2016.
The use and monitoring of Hand Held Security Devices utilized by Security Officers to test Light
Rail patrons’ MyRide cards and ensure accurate recording of their trip, has not met original
expectations. In addition, this equipment will no longer be supported by the manufacturer.
However, an alternative solution with additional cost, has recently been identified for 2016
implementation.
Pilot testing is continuing to validate that MyRide tapping data is accurately uploaded to
Revenue Reports which will be utilized to post related entries to the General Ledger in the live
environment.
CURRENT STATUS
Mutually agreed upon corrective action is underway and will be subject to our normal Audit
follow-up review as Internal Audit continues to be involved with the Project Team.

BACKGROUND SUMMARY
The WIN Program (Workforce Initiative Now) began in August 2011 and was initially funded by
a Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Innovative Transit Workforce Development Program
Grant in March 2011. The WIN Program’s collaborative approach to partnering leverages
existing providers to asses, train, and place community members into careers.
The WIN Program is led by RTD in coordination with the Community College of Denver, Denver
Transit Partners, and the Urban League of Metropolitan Denver. A recent renewal grant was
received from the FTA and provides approximately $660,000 covering the next two years for
WIN general operations, training, personnel, and related projects.
Per internal reporting, since 2011 the WIN Program has served over 1,500 individuals in career
explorations, job skills training, and placement. The program has placed over 600 participants
with more than 30 different employer partners, from small businesses to large contractors.
AUDIT SCOPE
The scope of our audit concentrated on reviewing the WIN Bowling Tournament/Fundraiser
event held in November 2014 to ensure proper planning, execution, and post-event evaluation.
We also reviewed inventory controls over supplies provided to successful candidates, ensuring
adequacy and proper tracking.
CONCLUSION
Future Fund Raising events will include improved financial reporting at their conclusion to
document a detailed Budget vs Actual analysis and variance explanations. In an effort to reduce
costs, the use of a contracted Event Planner will be reconsidered if any future similar events are
held. Management has created a more complete perpetual inventory tracking of boots, vests,
and other construction supplies to indicate which WIN participants such items are provided to
and identify when re-orders are necessary.
CURRENT STATUS
A ‘final’ Budget vs Actual analysis has since been prepared and a new inventory tracking
system is in place. No new fundraising events are currently planned.

Information

The Stored Value MyRide Card is a product that can be purchased by the general public to pay for
transit fares on fixed route buses and rail platforms. Stored Value is provided on reloadable plastic cards
encoded with chips. These cards can be loaded with certain dollar amounts and used much like a debit
card. Once the card is loaded, it can be used to board bus or rail until the dollar amount on the card is
less than the fare needed. Additional value can be loaded onto the card.
We are targeting January 1, 2016 for the Stored Value public pilot go-live which will include:
 Up to 5,000 customers will be selected to participate, participation will be staggered
 Stored Value available for purchase at RTD sales outlets
 Changes to the web portal that focus on Customer Care functionality
 Changes to the SMT System to accommodate the new fare structure
 Day Pass Printers installed and functioning on RTD fixed route buses
