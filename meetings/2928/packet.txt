Subject:

Board’s Options Upon Resignation of GM/CEO
per GM/CEO Employment Agreement

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is Recommended that the Board of Directors elect the option designated as number three under
Section 4(e) of the GM/CEO Employment Agreement.
BACKGROUND
The GM/CEO gave notice to the Board Chair on November 21, 2019 of the GM/CEO’s voluntary
retirement from the agency. The information concerning the GM/CEO’s resignation was shared with the
Board and with the public the next morning. A copy of the GM/CEO’s November 21, 2019 letter is
attached to this Board Report.
DISCUSSION
The GM/CEO Employment Agreement (“Contract”) provides for the voluntary resignation of the GM/CEO
at Section 4(e) of the Contract. Contract, page 5. The Contract is attached to this Board Report. In
summary, in the event of the voluntary resignation of the GM/CEO, the Board may determine, in its own
discretion, which of three options to elect, which options are generally summarized as (1) immediate
termination, (2) place GM/CEO on administrative leave for sixty (60) days, or (3) require GM/CEO to
continue providing services under the Contract for sixty (60) days. The GM/CEO’s November 21, 2019
letter confirmed his commitment to completing his time and working with the Board to assure a
seamless and smooth transition, anticipating a final date of January 20, 2020 for employment.
Informal discussions with each of the Directors have revealed a general consensus to accept the
GM/CEO’s offer to continue working with the Board for up to sixty (60) days, which would suggest that
the Board would favor electing the option designated as number three under Section 4(e) of the
Contract.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Per the Contract, Section 4(e), Regardless of which option the Board of Directors, in its sole discretion,
elects, Mr. Genova agrees that, upon termination of employment, he shall be entitled only to accrued but
unused vacation and accrued unused sick time as set forth in Paragraph 3(c); earned but unpaid Base
Salary, if any; approved expense reimbursements, if any; and any other payments or amounts as may be
required by applicable federal or state employment laws.
ALTERNATIVES
1. The Board may select option (1), termination, which would deprive the agency of any continuing
services of the GM/CEO and would leave the agency without any GM/CEO until an interim
GM/CEO could be appointed.

2. The Board may select option (2), administrative leave, which would deprive the agency of any
continuing services of the GM/CEO and would leave the agency without any GM/CEO until an
interim GM/CEO could be appointed.

Board Meeting Date:

Subject:

Procedures for Designating Interim GM/CEO

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is Recommended that the Board of Directors establish procedures for the timely selection of an Interim
General Manager.
BACKGROUND
Upon the resignation of the GM/CEO, the agency must timely select an Interim GM/CEO so that critical
administrative functions are satisfied. Time is of the essence. At least in part, that is the reason that
the Board requires the GM/CEO to have in place at all times the General Manager Succession Plan. The
current General Manager's Succession Plan is attached to this Board Report. Regulators (including the FTA, the
FRA and the PUC), lawmakers, bond rating agencies, stakeholders, collaborators, constituents, agency
employees, and the general public want and deserve to have a responsible individual in charge of the
agency. A seamless transition of authority is central to the agency’s ability to deliver on its mission of
providing safe, clean, reliable, courteous, accessible and cost-effective transportation services
throughout the District so that the agency can continue to move people, to their jobs, their homes, their
schools, their health appointments, their recreation and elsewhere.
DISCUSSION
In 2010, following the retirement of GM Cal Marsala, the Board faced the need to hire a new GM/CEO,
something that had not been experienced for over fourteen years. At that time Board Executive
Manager Paula Perdue and Board Chair Lee Kemp collaborated in producing a document entitled, “Board
of Directors Documentation on Process for Hiring/Transitioning to a New General Manager” (“2010
Memo”), which is attached to this Board Report. Two elements of the 2010 Memo are particularly
relevant here.
Section 3.0 of the 2010 Memo provides that the Board Chair will appoint members to an ad hoc
committee to focus on the transition.
Section 4.0 of the 2010 Memo provides that the Board members will name the Interim General Manager
as defined in the General Manager’s Succession Plan or as determined by the approval of the full Board.
The 2010 Memo is the only documentation that the Board Office has been able to discover, following a
diligent search, concerning this process in 2010. That is not particularly notable as the 2010 Memo is
an extended and detailed documentation on process.
On March 12, 2015 the Board received the letter of resignation from GM Phil Washington. The
Executive Committee met in a regularly scheduled session on March 17, 2015 and considered the
matter. The Agenda for that meeting is attached to this Board Report. That Agenda included discussion
of the appointment of a transition team, review of the transition process policy, and a motion to approve
procurement and budget for GM transition, inter alia.

Packet Pg. 19

1.D.2

The Minutes for the March 17, 2015 Executive Meeting are also attached to this Board Report. The
Minutes reflect that Board Chair Chuck Sisk, pursuant to his powers under the RTD Bylaws to appoint ad
hoc committees, appointed his GM Executive Search Committee. Directors Menten and Lubow were
present at that meeting and asked questions about the process, which were answered by Chair Sisk.
Director Folska was also present and participated in the discussion.
Board Executive Manager Paula Perdue presented to the Executive Committee the 2010 Memo she had
previously prepared and discussed the same at length. Directors Menten, Lubow and Folska were
actively engaged in this discussion. In discussing next steps for the process, Chair Sisk informed the
Executive Committee that they would follow a process of inviting members of the Senior Leadership
Team to submit for the position of Interim General Manager, with invitations going out two days later
(March 19, 2015) and responses due by April 1, with a targeted decision by the full Board on April 10.
The Board conducted its regularly scheduled full Board Meeting on March 24, 2015, at which time Chair
Sisk reported concerning the GM Executive Search Committee he had established, noting that the
Committee had conducted its first meeting that afternoon. He shared that the invitation to apply as
Interim General Manager had gone out to the Senior Leadership Team (as had been discussed in the
March 17 Executive Committee Meeting), with applications due on April 1 and interviews to follow.
March 24, 2015 Board Minutes, Section VII. Those Minutes are attached to this Board Report.
On April 9, 2015, which was 31 days after GM Phil Washington had submitted his letter of resignation,
the Board held a Special Board Meeting in order to adopt a Resolution appointing an Interim General
Manager. The Agenda and Board Report for that Special Board Meeting are attached to this Board
Report. Noting in the Resolution that “the RTD Board of Directors desire to maintain continuity and
stability during the transition period while a permanent General Manager replacement is found,” the
Board appointed Dave Genova as the Interim General Manager. The Resolution was adopted as
Resolution No. 002, Series of 2015, and was signed by Board Chair Sisk and Board Secretary Jeff
Walker.
On April 14, 2015 the GM Executive Search Committee conducted a meeting to develop an action plan
for the executive search and to approve a form for the RFP for an executive search firm. The agenda
and materials for that meeting are attached to this Board Report.
If and as any further materials are discovered concerning the search process in 2015, the same will be
made available to the Board.
In sum, the departure of a General Manager in 2010 and again in 2015 necessitated the timely
appointment of an Interim General Manager. Information is not currently available as to how long the
process took in 2010, but our best guess is that the process was conducted in a prompt manner. In
2015 the process took just 31 days from the receipt of the resignation.
Both the 2010 and the 2015 processes relied upon an ad hoc committee appointed by the Chair to
facilitate the Board search and were informed, but not controlled, by the General Manager’s Succession
Plan.
In 2019 this Board must now determine the process for selecting an Interim General Manager, either by
confirming the process instituted and followed by the Board in 2010 and again in 2015, or by crafting a
new process.

Packet Pg. 20

1.D.2

ALTERNATIVES
1. Appoint as Interim General Manager one of the three individuals named by General Manager
Genova in the General Manager's Succession Plan.
2. Solicit applications for the position of Interim General Manager from the Senior Leadership Team
for initial review by an ad hoc committee appointed by the Chair for this limited purpose, with
final review and then appointment by the full Board as an Interim General Manager.
3. Prepare an RFP for the engagement of an Executive Search Firm to conduct a nationwide search
for the position of Interim General Manager, approve the RFP, select an Executive Search Firm
from RFP respondents to conduct the search, review and then select an applicant from
candidates recruited to serve as Interim General Manager.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
1. Alternatives 1. And 2. The expected timeline for this interim role will continue until a permanent
replacement for this position can be hired. During this period of time, an upgrade in compensation
to reflect the appropriate adjustment of 10% of current base salary, or minimum of the salary
range, whichever is greater will be applied.
2. Alternative 3 would come with a substantial financial impact to the agency as recruiting from the
outside is costly and takes a much longer period of time to make a placement. An internal interim
to an interim external placement would need to take place if an external candidate were not
identified by January 20, 2020 because of financial signing authority.

Process Overview

This document defines the process that was followed by the RTD Board of
Directors for the hiring of a new General Manager following the resignation of the
current General Manager. Prior to this time, a General Manager had not been hired
in over fourteen years so no processes had been documented. This process
addresses most of the major concerns during the transition and can be used as a
guide for future hiring/transitioning to a new General Manager for the RTD transit
agency.

transition. This Committee and members may be a newly appointed
Committee or may be the activation of the General Manager Oversight and
Performance Management Committee. Ideally members of this Committee
will reflect the agency’s goal for diversity.
The Chair of the Transition Team will mobilize his team to develop a
transition planning strategy—meetings, timelines, communications, etc.
They will review the succession plan to see what it says about the interim
position.

The Transition Team representative will provide confidential information to
Civic Leader Panelists on candidates at the appropriate time (i.e. resumes,
etc)
The Transition Team will provide a private venue for Civic Leader Panelists
to conduct interviews.
The Civic Leader Panelists will be asked to sign a confidential form of nondisclosure.
Selecting Prospects, Candidates and Finalists
The Transition Team and full Board need to be very clear in identifying the
different stages of the application process. Prospects are defined in the
early stage as individuals who may self-submit or come as recommended
from others as a good potential for the position. Many of these prospects
may be gainfully employed and a revelation of their names and interest could
have detrimental effects on their career. During this early stage, the names
of the prospects are treated in the most confidential manner and are not
public information.
The names of prospects who show potential and have been screened by the
National Executive Search firm could be presented on an intermediate short
Candidate list (18-20) names to the Transition Committee for further
screening and determination if there is an interest in interviewing the
candidate (iterative process).
The Transition Team will review the resumes and implement a process to
determine if candidates from the short list meet their criteria. Approval will
be obtained from the full Board on the short list of names for interviewing.
All information is handled and processed as confidential on potential
candidates including location, hotel and travel accommodations and
interviewing venue.
Finalists are considered those candidates who have been identified by the
Board as the top 3-4 candidates and who they want to bring back for a final
interview. Colorado State statutes require a public announcement to be
made at least 14 days prior to appointing or electing a finalist to the
position.
Finalists will also have been screened, reference and background checks
performed by the National Executive Search Firm. Finalists will be required
to complete the RTD Employment Application Form.
Press notification is made for public release of the names of the finalist/s.
The Interview Process
The interview process is used to further screen potential candidates and to
narrow the choices down to a critical few who may become finalists.
One or several forms of interview types can be used to further drill in on a
candidate’s competency and his/her potential match to the position: phone
interviews, Interactive Video, group interviews, and return interviews.

The Transition Team may elect to conduct two forms of interviews: The
“softball” approach where top candidates are asked to meet with the Board
members in a more informal exchange manner to determine if there is mutual
interest. The follow-up interview called the “Hardball” is used once this list
of top candidates are narrowed down to the critical few or top finalists.
Questions in this interview are intended to challenge the candidate in terms
of visionary, strategic and out of the box thinking. The Hardball interview
may be professionally video graphed.
The Transition Team will solicit interview questions from the full Board and
will develop a list of 5-7 strategic questions that will be asked of each of the
candidates (Transition Team Working group). These questions will be
handled and retained in a confidential manner until the day of the interviews.
Copies will be limited and controlled distribution.
The Transition Team will define the process they will use in the interview
process (i.e. who will ask the questions, if the full Board will participant or
only the Transition Team with the rest of the members as silent observers,
how questions will be fielded, etc)
Prior to the selection of the finalists, the maintenance of confidentiality is
extremely important and Board members are strongly encouraged not to
accept calls from the media or others related to this matter until press
release has been made on the finalists (3-4). This discussion should be held
with the full Board.
When the Board has agreed upon the top 3-4 candidates who will become
finalists, a press release announcement will be released to the General
Public. According to Colorado Law, this public announcement should be
made at least 14 days prior to appointing or electing one of the finalists to
fill the position (CRS 24-6-402 (3.5)
The Transition Team may also consider having members of the team to visit
the home base of the top candidates for information gathering purposes.
Discussions and interviews of candidates for the General Manager position
can be held in executive sessions subject to the requirements of CRS 24-6-

402 (4).

Hosting a Stakeholder Forum (Reception)
Once the Finalists have been identified, the Transition Team will host an
open stakeholder forum to introduce the finalists to the community (i.e.
stakeholders, elected officials, employees, and Senior Leadership staff).
This event will be publicized and interested parties will be encouraged to
attend.
The Finalists make a 5 minute introductory remark followed by an
opportunity for the guests to ask more direct questions in a small group
setting. Guests will be able to move around in various discussion groups
with the finalists. Afterwards, the participating guests will be asked to
complete a stakeholder’s comment card which will be summarized and
results provided to the Transition Team (and full Board) the next day.

The Selection and Notification Process
The selection of a new General Manager will be made by the full Board
based on a myriad of input sources and processes: Input from stakeholders
and employees on General Manager’s traits and qualities; Board assessment
of leadership needed; Input from Civic Leaders Panel on strengths and
weaknesses of the candidates; Input from participants at the stakeholder’s
Forum, evaluations from interviews and other sources of pertinent
information.
Board members will discuss and rank who they feel is the top person for the
job. The goal will be to have full consensus.
If an obvious leader does not emerge, Board members will revisit their
process with the Public Affairs Consultant and the National Executive Search
Firm to define next steps.
Once a recommendation is reached the Board members will convene in
either a special Board meeting or regular Board meeting for an official vote.
All of the finalists will be notified of the decision via phone by the Chair of
the Transition Team as soon as possible. This will be followed up by a letter
to the Finalists thanking them for their consideration.
A Press Release of the Hiring will be made by the RTD Public Affairs.

Contract Negotiations
The Transition Team should identify the member/s of the contract
negotiation team. It may be the Chair of the Board with assistance from the
General Counsel.
The Transition Team should provide the contract negotiation team with the
parameters and compensation guidelines for the negotiation that was
previously reviewed and approved by the full Board.
The Transition Team/Negotiator should consider using an external
employment attorney for the crafting of the contract and negotiation terms.
If so, a RFP for competitive services is required.
The General Counsel (or designate) will vet the proposed terms of the
contract (i.e. salary, benefits, pension, etc) through appropriate entities such
as the attorney over pension benefits, CFO, or the actuary and financial
audit to validate the financial impact on the agency through the contract
period.
The Negotiator will work with the National Executive Search Firm as the
intermediate to the selected General Manager. If desired, he may also work
directly with the selected General Manager.
The Negotiator will keep the Transition Team advised of progress and will
solicit input from the Transition Team/Board on issues that may fall outside
the guidelines and parameters of the approved negotiation.

II. Status Update on Interim General Manager
Chair Sisk turned the meeting over to Paula Perdue for a review of the process.
a. Review of Job Description—Paula referenced the interim job description that
had been created in 2009 and asked for feedback. Director Bagley noted a
couple of changes relative to the Strategic Budget Plan and updating of
information. Director Tobiassen suggested it would be a good idea to send
out to the full Board and ask for their changes by Thursday, March 26.
Paula noted she needs to run this past HR to make sure we are in
compliance.
b. Invitations Submitted to SLT-Paula shared that the invitations to apply for
the Interim General Manager were submitted to the Senior Leadership team.

Treasurer – Larry Hoy, District J

April 3. In preparation for these interviews, sub-committees need to be
looking at two components:
i. Develop a criteria for Evaluating/selecting the GM-Director Tobiassen
to lead
ii. Work on possible questions for interview-Chair Sisk
Paula would compile the list of questions which will also be reviewed/modified
by the committee on March 31. The final list of questions will be vetted with
Human Resources and vaulted for confidentiality until the interviews.
c. Discussion on Criteria for Evaluating/Selection of Interim GM
The committee decided that as a starting point, they would resurrect the
criteria and the questions used in 2009 and solicit input from the full Board.
The criteria with weights and scoreboard would be worked on by Director
Tobiassen who would bring some recommendations forward on March 31.
c. Process for Interviews
The committee discussed the process for the interview and will need to
come up with how the interviews will be conducted. Will the full Board be
involved in a silent mode? Will there be a lead person on the committee
asking the questions or will they use a round-robin approach for questioning?
d. Special Board meeting
The committee will bring forth a recommended action for the selection of
the Interim General Manager before the full Board for approval. A special
Board meeting is needed for this action. Possible times for a Special Board
meeting could be April 9 following the Stand Up4Transportation event.
III. Assignment of Buddy System
Committee members began the assignment of Buddies. They noted that each of
them would have two buddies.
Chair Sisk—Directors Lasater & Director Walker
Director Bagley—Directors Anderson and James
Director Deadwyler—Directors Folska and Lubow
Director Tobiassen-Directors Archuleta and Solano
Director Francone-Directors Menten and Hoy
Committee members are responsible for contacting their buddies within 24 hours of
the meeting.
IV. Calendaring for Meeting Schedule
Paula Perdue presented a draft timeline of activities over the next couple of weeks.
As soon as the strategic advisory service is named, they will expound upon these
activities and timelines. She noted this is a very aggressive schedule. She also
noted planned time off by committee members but that the process will continue in
their stead. Chair Sisk noted it is important that people have a life.
V. Begin work on communications plan
Paula Perdue indicated it is important that the Committee have a communications
plan which minimally need to include these elements: Who they will be targeting,
what the key messages will be, timing and frequency of communications,
communications channels and who will deliver the message. The buddy system as
identified will be one of the primary ways the Board will communicate with each
Packet Pg. 40

Attachment: 03.24.15 GMESC Minutes (4018 : Procedures for Designating Interim GM/CEO)

1.D.2.c

other. Copies of the minutes from the meetings will be disseminated within three
days of the meeting. Chair Sisk will also plan on including a monthly update at the
Board meetings.
Director Bagley emphasized that this communications plan is very critical. One of
the primary task of the strategic advisory service will be to help the Committee
develop a comprehensive plan for how we communicate internally and externally.
He noted that in 2009 we engaged a number of stakeholders and others in this
process. The full Board will need to step up and meet with designated people in
the community. Chair Sisk noted we have former Board members ready to help as
well as CAC, Transit Alliance, etc.
Director Deadwyler suggested one of the ways we could start is making sure after
each meeting, we identify the key messages we want to take forward. Director
Tobiassen added we could follow this up as an email distribution. Director
Tobiassen also suggested we look at using the web based notification process for
the topic of “GM Executive Search.” He also suggested we use the Monday
Morning Q to communicate key messages to the employees.
Paula Perdue indicated she would start a draft plan. Director Bagley offered to
assist.
VI. Discuss Transition Team members (2) meet with SLT
The Committee discussed meeting with Senior Leadership to understand their
issues and concerns. Suggested date for this meeting is April 15 or after the
selection of an interim. Chair Sisk and Director Tobiassen will attend the meeting.
VII. RFP for Strategic Advisory Service-Evaluation Committee & Selection Criteria
Paula Perdue indicated the RFP for Strategic Advisory Service was submitted to
four bidders. Responses are due March 27. The evaluation team will consist of
Directors Bagley and Deadwyler, Paula Perdue and Linda Wells, Procurement Agent.
The evaluation team will plan to meet on Tuesday, March 31 prior to the GM
Executive Search Committee to review responses and possibly come up with a
recommendation for the Committee.
VIII. Discuss GM Effective Termination Date/Payoff Schedule
The Committee discussed possible effective last day for GM based around the
upcoming schedule to hire a GM and close out key business. Chair Sisk will have a
conversation with General Manager relative to this issue.
IX. Create next step timeline-see the working calendar for this committee
X. Other matters
a. GM Task Goals for 2016—The committee discussed the task goals from the
March 21 joint strategic planning advance. They discussed the feasibility of
delaying the next steps which would normally be the General Manager
would come before the Board at the April 28 study session with detailed
implementation plans. The Committee was concerned not to delay the
budget calendar and felt initially the April 28 should still be a target. A
Packet Pg. 41

Attachment: 03.24.15 GMESC Minutes (4018 : Procedures for Designating Interim GM/CEO)

1.D.2.c

subsequent discussion between Chair Sisk and GM Washington who
expressed his team was already overloaded, felt that the May 12th
Committee day maybe more doable for the Interim General Manager to
report out on the implementation plans.
b. Attributes for a General Manager—Paula Perdue distributed preliminary
copies of the attributes for a General Manager which the Board had
discussed at the Joint Strategic Planning Advance on March 21, 2015. She
is awaiting the official minutes and documents from Gary Suiter, the
facilitator of the event.

Retiree Awards
There were four retirees for the month of March but only one was in attendance.
General Manager Washington introduced Kevin St. Croix, retired Division Manager, and
asked Bruce Abel, AGM of Bus Operations, and Mike Gil, Deputy AGM of Bus Operations,
to join them.
Bruce Abel said that Kevin is retiring after 35 years of service at RTD. He started in 1980
as a bus operator. Mike Gil shared that an interesting part of Kevin’s career is that he is
one of the few that remember the layoffs in 1981-1982. He drove a bus for 5 years,
went to the Alameda division as a Dispatcher, moved to District Shops as a Lead
Dispatcher and spent the last part of his career as a Division Manager at multiple RTD
divisions. Mike Gil said that he has been one outstanding asset to RTD and he will be
missed terribly.
Kevin St. Croix said it has been a great career at RTD. He remembers coming to a Board
meeting and telling the Directors they were dysfunctional during some very public
disputes, which was a shaky time in his career. There were some good times and bad
times but for the most part it was a great place to work. He thanked RTD for the privilege
to work here.
Chair Sisk congratulated Kevin on his retirement and thanked him for his years of service.
He said that our employees make the District the success that it is.

Doug Gragg, Denver, said his concern this evening is for the selection committee for
the General Manager. He realizes that there is the political practice of RTD looking
nationally for a new General Manager, he believes that if the Board looked locally
within the District the committee could find a minority woman that could fill the
position. There is no need to go to NY City to do it.
Gary Van Dorn, National Federation of the Blind Board Member and President of the
National Federation of the Blind CO Chapter, expressed the NFBCO’s concern over the
recent outage of the automated stop announcements. While they were happy that the
RTD sent out a very clear and concise email about the issue that also asked drivers to
announce the stops, many drivers failed to do so. He requested that RTD provide the
NFBCO with an explanation of what caused such a catastrophic failure in the
automated stop announcement system.
Shantá Farrington, Denver, works as a Community Organizer for Front Range Economic
Strategy Center (FRESC). This organization provides outreach and support, especially
to low-income and disadvantaged communities, during community engagement
processes. She said that FRESC supports the Mile High Connects fare proposal; they
hope that prior to any decisions related to fare in the next few weeks the community’s
voice will be heard.
Joe Tripplet, Denver, expressed concern over the proposed increases to the Access-aRide fare. He worries that eventually Access-a-Ride riders, especially seniors and the
disabled, will no longer be able to afford the cost of this service. He recognized that
while Access-a-Cab is a great alternative, it is not a realistic alternative in the outlying
areas of the District. He asked staff to provide him the rule that Access-a-Ride fare
must be twice the fare of a comparable fixed route.
Andrea Suhaka, Denver, DRMAC Board Member and Chair of the Transportation
Solutions Arapahoe County, has been very involved in the fare study that Mile High
connects is conducting. She believes our low-income community is very
disadvantaged with the new fares RTD is proposing. She thinks the fares for lowincome riders should be at the senior discount price or lower; people that depend on
RTD for their living need to have a lower fare.
Richard McClintock, Denver, has been a long time smart growth and livable
communities advocate. He looks forward to participating in RTD’s upcoming fare
study public hearings; however, he is here tonight for a very different reason. He
would like to thank General Manager Washington for his service. He can only say that
this is a loss for RTD and LA’s gain. He stated that the motto of building as much as
we can as fast as we can has really come to fruition based on his leadership. Rick

McClintock recognized the challenge ahead of the Board in finding a new GM who is as
smart and capable as GM Washington.
Kenny Shepard, Denver, expressed his concern over the new proposed fare to DIA. He
believes RTD will get more revenue if we lower the fare to one that is comparable to
other large cities, like $5.
Hanni Raly, The Arc of Aurora, spoke on behalf of the intellectually and
developmentally disabled community. She said that many of the individuals they work
with are dependent upon government assistance, low-income, and rely upon public
transportation. They see transportation as the conduit for full community inclusion,
recognizing that annually 560,000 people with disabilities never leave their home
because of transportation difficulties. In looking at the proposed fare structure, her
organization knows this number will only grow if adopted. She expressed frustration
that her organization is unable to participate in the Non-Profit Agency Reduced Fare
Program as it is today, limiting their ability to assist their community that cannot afford
our fares. The administrative burdens, cumbersome tracking requirements and huge
upfront costs preclude their participation since they receive no public funding. She
believes that in order for the program to be fully realized RTD needs to:
o Consider decreasing the administrative burdens and tracking components
o Consider offering a deeper discount or sliding scale for organizations that work with
low-income populations
o Consider expanding the program for offering payment options that do not require a
complete upfront investment
o Consider allowing cooperatives for non-profit organizations
She stated that by increasing access to programs that increase access to transit all of
our communities win.
Ana Barrera-Ochoa, Denver, spoke not only on behalf of FRESC but also on behalf of
the low-income and working class families. These groups are very concerned that the
fares are going to increase. The working class families are already struggling; it is very
important they are taken into consideration as part of RTD’s fare study. She said that
not only are many of these families transit reliant but they also need transportation for
better jobs and opportunities.

General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Update
Committee Chair Bagley commented that the Board and Senior Leadership Team had the
planning advance for 2016 over the weekend. The goal of this advance was to define
specific task goals for the General Manager and Agency for 2016. He said that the GM
Oversight and Performance Management Committee would begin working with the Interim
General Manager in late April to establish the tactical plans for achieving these goals.
Chair Sisk noted that the GM Executive Search Committee has been established and
includes Directors Bagley, Deadwyler, Francone, Tobiassen and himself as Chair of the
Committee. The Committee had their first meeting this afternoon and achieved a great
deal. Chair Sisk recognized the work of Paula Perdue, Executive Director to the Board, as
she was instrumental in making sure it was a good first meeting. He shared that an
invitation to apply was extended to the Senior Leadership team. The deadline for
applications is April 1st, interviews will be conducted shortly thereafter, with a goal of
appointing an Interim General Manager the week of April 6th at a Special Board Meeting.
He noted that the Committee is moving promptly and efficiently so there is a smooth
transition. Chair Sisk recognized this is a large undertaking but it will be done in a very
transparent way with input from employees, stakeholders, public, etc.

General Manager's Report
General Manager Washington thanked the Board, and particularly Chair Sisk, for
understanding his decision to move to LA Metro and their support during this process. He
also thanked the stakeholders, staff, mayors, commissioners and CDOT. GM Washington
said that what has been accomplished over the last six years, which is quite a bit, was
really a joint and team effort. He recognized that six years ago there was not much going
on but now the West Line is open with 5 more openings coming in 2015. He is very
proud of the work the team has done. GM Washington believes that we will not fully
realize what we have accomplished for a couple decades when our grandchildren and
great-grandchildren are using the transit infrastructure built under our watch.

Chair Sisk reviewed the following events and awards that Board members participated in
during the month of March:

GM Washington shared that on March 6th USDOT announced a pilot program and
regulatory change that will allow transportation agencies to utilize local hiring preferences
on USDOT funded projects. In this pilot USDOT made no provision for comment and they
allowed 30 days for comment on a permanent regulatory change. He said that APTA has
submitted a request to extend the comment period and would like to host a webinar for
USDOT to explain what these provisions mean. To date USDOT has not acted on the
request for an extension. He stated the current comment period ends April 6. APTA will
still have a webinar on March 26th at 12:00 p.m. Eastern time to discuss this provision and
any legal issues that may arise. GM Washington noted that the transit industry, especially
the supply/private part of the industry, is pushing back on these provisions, especially as it
relates to rolling stock. He believes this webinar will do a good job in answering some of
the questions out there. He asked Marla Lien, General Counsel, to explain this provision as
it relates to Colorado Laws.
Marla Lien explained that the change in regulation deals only with local hiring preferences
pertaining to the use of labor. In Colorado, the only statute on Colorado labor on public
works does not apply to RTD; it applies to counties, school districts and municipalities
requiring Colorado labor to perform 80% of the work on a public works project. She
stated that RTD does not have a local hiring preference policy nor do we have a state law
applicable to labor on project. In Colorado there are other statutes that would be
implicated if the statute expands; there is a preference regarding commodities and services
and there are bid preferences on public projects. Both of these statutes do include RTD.
Marla Lien explained that those are not currently addressed by the regulatory change but
the webinar will discuss what other kinds of labor or contracting could be affected by local
hiring preferences if USDOT expands the program. She stated that she is not concerned
about this regulatory change diminishing competition on RTD’s projects even if the
program goes forward.
GM Washington explained that this is one of USDOT Secretary Foxx’s initiatives called
ladders of opportunity. The idea is to ensure that local workers benefit from economic
opportunities that transportation projects present.
GM Washington noted that a memo outlining the proposed Flatiron Flyer milestones would
be sent to the Board. The proposed dates are:
 June 30, 2015 – Media events announcing the arrival of the Flatiron Flyer pilot bus
 August 13, 2015 – Opening of Boulder Junction
 October 24, 2015 – Station Ribbon Cutting and Parties, full Flatiron Flyer fleet
arrival
 January 17, 2015 – BRT service change

Director Menten asked for clarification if USDOT would be participating in the APTA
webinar. She expressed concern that we would not really be able to learn how this might
affect RTD if USDOT is not participating. GM Washington said that USDOT had not
confirmed their involvement but APTA plans to host the webinar either way. He thinks
that even if they do not officially participate there will be some USDOT representatives on
the phone hearing the questions/concerns.

Authorization to execute a budget transfer to purchase thermal printers

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute a budget transfer in an
amount up to $1,900,000 from the Mall Shuttle project in order to purchase and install
the equipment necessary to accommodate the sale of fare media under the proposed fare
structure.
Director Tobiassen shared that as the Chair of the Financial Administration and Audit
Committee, he has been speaking with many Board members and staff, and it is clear
there are still a number of questions that need to be addressed. Director Tobiassen
requested that this item be removed from this evening’s agenda and brought back to the
Board at the April 21, 2015 Board meeting. This would also allow for staff to provide a
more in-depth explanation of this item at the April 14, 2015 Financial Administration and
Audit Committee meeting to ensure everyone’s questions are answered.
Director Anderson expressed concern that postponing this item might set back the
openings scheduled for 2016. General Manager Washington stated that he and Director
Tobiassen had discussed this item. He stated that he does not have concerns about the
timeline for the 2016 openings if this item is delayed until the next Board meeting.
Director Menten inquired if staff had consulted with the bond counsel at this time. Marla
Lien stated that was one of the things being worked on prior to the committee meeting
briefing.
This item was delayed until the April 21, 2015 Board Meeting.

General Manager Washington thanked the RTD staff, led by Pauletta Tonilas, for all of
their efforts related to Stand Up for Transportation Day on April 9th. This is hugely
important for infrastructure in this country as May 31 is the end date for MAP-21. He
stated that this event is gaining steam and brining attention to the issue. He thanked the
Directors for their support and participation.
Director Folska thanked staff for all their efforts surrounding Stand Up for Transportation.
She had her bus signing event recently and there were so many people signing that she
does not think there is room for even one more signature. She recognized the wonderful
job that GM Washington has done within the District and thanked him for his efforts.
Director Menten expressed her appreciation for having the RTD Board/Senior Leadership
Team Advance within the District. She knows of government bodies that feel it is better
to take an expensive trip outside their area, which she does not support.
Director Bagley stated that, in reference to the Strategic Planning Advance, there has
never been any thought of having this anyplace but close to the Blake Street offices and
within the District.
Director Lasater shared that he recently attended a Southwest (SW) Rail Extension
meeting hosted by Director Bagley. He complimented Director Bagley on having such an
informative and well attended meeting. He believes there was some very good dialogue
related to the future of the SW Rail Extension.
Director Bagley thanked Director Lasater for his attendance at the meeting. He noted that
he has been working with staff for the last 6 months about the SW Rail Extension; the
model for the Southeast Rail Extension has motivated his community to look at ways to
move their extension forward. He thanked staff and GM Washington for their
involvement.

Board Staff Contact: Paula Perdue

ID Number: 15120
Chaired by:
Chair Sisk
I. Call to Order
Chair Sisk called the meeting to order at 3:05 p.m. In attendance were Chair Sisk,
Committee members Director Tobiassen, Director Deadwyler, Director Bagley and
Director Francone. Also in attendance were Director Folska and Paula Perdue,
Executive Director for the Board.
Special guests included Roger Sherman, CRL Strategic Advisory Services; Brian Iacono,
Procurement Manager and Linda Wells, Procurement Agent (4:00 p.m.).
II. Draft Comprehensive Communications Plan Discussion (R. Sherman)
Roger Sherman provided a draft handout for developing a comprehensive
communications plan. He provided a building block approach for receiving input and
for providing information. A distinction was made between the input process of
providing opportunities for formal input by community/civic leaders, key
stakeholders/community leaders, internal employees and the general public. The
committee discussed the possibility of using a moderated focus group of 10-12 highlevel executive representatives from key categories such as Chamber/EDC,
Mayors/elected officials, higher education, healthcare, nonprofit, City Manager, large
employer, small employer, business community and legislative. Roger emphasized the
importance of having key decision makers from representative organizations with
experience in hiring at the executive level and who have run large organizations for this
focus group.
Several ideas were shared around using focus groups to obtain employee input and

Chair – Chuck Sisk, District 0
First Vice Chair – Tom Tobiassen, District F
Second Vice Chair – Natalie Menten, District M
Secretary – Jeff Walker, District D
Treasurer – Larry Hoy, District J

1.D.2.g

Roger Sherman took the action item to begin working on what might be appropriate
categories for the focus group. Chair Sisk and Director Tobiassen will meet with the
Senior Leadership Team next week as part of a listening process to understand the
concerns of this leadership group.
Paula Perdue will investigate in-house capabilities for providing survey monkey to
obtain employee input and general public input.
Pertaining to information, the question is how critical is it to provide regular updates to
interested stakeholders and the general public using customized methods to deliver a
consistent message. Some of the questions to address are who are the audience,
components of mass communications to the external audiences, targeted audiences
and when do we need to communicate. Roger emphasized we need to communicate
where there are opportunities for input, key milestones and major decisions.
Otherwise, the information is redundant and non-beneficial.
Other ideas such as town hall meetings, open forums hosted by other organizations
and engaging with local newspapers were all discussed. The use of social media was
also discussed. The committee will continue to discuss and begin to ferret down on
those options that will meet the goals for obtaining input and sharing meaningful
information.
Initial energies will be on identifying categories and possible names for the high-level
focus group, sources for internal communications such as employee listening sessions
or online surveys, including the meeting with Senior Leadership, and ways/when to
include the general public. Roger Sherman will also begin developing a schedule to see
how these communication input and information actions might roll into the schedule.
The committee discussed how this communications outreach process might roll into
the process of determining the skillsets desired for a General Manager. The Committee
felt the information on attributes from the joint strategic planning advance is a good
start.
III. Communications Process Flow
Chair Sisk indicated that communications relate to this search needs to be very
sensitive and respect the desires of the Board of Directors. We need to make sure that
all communications are properly coordinated with the Committee with their buddy
input. We discussed the issue of the Press Release on the Interim General Manager
Packet Pg. 62

Attachment: 04.14.15 GMESC minutes (4018 : Procedures for Designating Interim GM/CEO)

working with our riders to obtain input. The committee concluded that various
channels and opportunities will be explored to obtain input from community
organizations, employees and the general public that could include such things as
online surveys, small discussion groups, listening sessions, open forums and use of
Citizen Advisory Services. Director Bagley expressed that this is quite a time
consuming process so the committee needs to think about how to properly scale this
outreach effort.

1.D.2.g

The Committee felt that an accurate press release from the GM Executive Search
Committee is critical and the Board Chair and Executive Director of the Board will craft
the press releases with input and guidance from Roger Sherman, CRL. Committee
Chair Sisk also requested Roger Sherman and Paula Perdue to work with the in-house
Communications group on the process to ensure communications do not get altered
without the consent of the Committee.
IV. RFP for Executive Search firm
Chair Sisk posed the question on if there are other alternatives for the General Manager
search than employing an Executive Search firm. He wanted to question the
hypothesis on if a RFP is required. (I.e. can this be done in-house or are there other
models for hiring of executives that we should consider). Roger Sherman referenced
how CU Benson was hired and a reference was made to the LA model where General
Manager Washington was hired by the Mayor of Los Angeles. Chair Sisk inquired of
the cost for the Executive Search firm in 2009. Brian Iacono reminded the group that
we actually asked for two set of searches: one for a General Manager and another for
a Capitals Program Manager. In the end, the Board decided on one position. Relative
to that search, the estimated cost for the GM was approximately $40K with another
$30K for expenses. He would anticipate that cost to be a little higher in 2015.
The Committee discussed the merits of trying to do this process in-house. Brian
Iacono did note that we had performed a national search for some of the Assistant
General Manager’s positons; however, it is perceived that the RFP process provides us
with a negotiated procurement process and helps in finding high caliber candidates.
Director Deadwyler pointed out that we have a number of internal issues with using inhouse that includes capabilities, confidentiality, commitment to diversity and trust
factors that would affect her ability to support an in-house process. We know that all
eyes are on us and we need to focus on the best and most objective process to secure
the best and the brightest GM for this agency.
The Committee concurred that the RFP process is our best option and the cost for such
a visible search is appropriate.
Brian Iacono walked through a couple of important sections of the RFP, namely the
time schedule, the criteria for selection and the scope of work. He addressed a couple
of questions by Director Francone around the DBE/SBE requirements. He stated that
while we do not necessarily have a specific goal, this will be reviewed by our Civil
Rights department to make sure it is appropriate. Although there may not be a goal,
we like to encourage our bidders to consider SBE/DBE for subcontracting opportunities.

and noted the released press release was not the one that had been worked on by
members of the Executive Search committee. The Committee discussed some of the
concerns around not having proper controls over the communications that get released.
Committee members expressed an expectation that the Strategic Advisor Service
Consultant would help guide us with communications throughout this process.

1.D.2.g

Director Bagley inquired of Paula and Linda if they had looked at the scope of work and
what was their take. Linda responded the scope is similar to the 2009 scope of work
and may have some bias toward the two positions that we advertised for in 2009.
Paula indicated she did not think this was the issue but in drilling down on the scope of
work, she thinks there are a couple of things that this gives to the Board. First, the
scope of work puts much of the onus for screening out candidates who do not meet
qualifications on the Executive Search firm and the firm only brings back to the Board
the top 20 or so of qualified candidates. In 2009, we had over 250 applicants that
were screened by the Executive Search firm; secondly, this removes the Board
members from getting caught up with having to address friends or others who want to
apply for the position. We use the same process for all candidates and they are
referred to our Executive Search firm for the screening process; thirdly, the scope of
work helps to address some of the concerns around confidentiality of candidates who
might want to apply for this position.
The Committee decided to proceed with the RFP process. Paula and Linda will make
the indicated changes to the procurement document and scope of work. Paula will
also provide a copy of the list of bidders from 2009 which has been modified to
include local search firms, and search firms recommended highly by Squires Patton and
Boggs and other trusted people.

Subject:

Begin Discussion of Procedures for Selection of
Permanent GM/CEO

DISCUSSION
All of the materials attached to the Board Report for Agenda Item B concerning Determination of
Procedures for Designating Interim GM/CEO are relevant to an initial discussion of procedures for
selection of a new permanent GM/CEO. As such, those items are incorporated by this reference into
this Board Report concerning Agenda Item C. This matter is equally important as the selection of an
Interim General Manager, but it does not possess quite the same degree of urgency. The selection of a
new GM/CEO in 2015 was a carefully considered and transparent process that effectively commenced
on March 12, 2015 and was initially concluded in mid-December 2015 (with the selection of Dave
Genova as GM/CEO), but not finally concluded until an employment agreement was finally negotiated
and executed in mid-March 2016. The Board Office has secured information from APTA confirming that
a new GM/CEO selection process typically takes longer than the 12 months taken by RTD in 2015.
The Board’s discussion on December 3 is an opportunity to consider and understand the similar
processes followed in 2010 and again in 2015, while at the same time exploring whether there are other
“best practices” that have evolved in the transportation industry in the last four years. In either event,
the Board may appropriately be informed and guided by past Board-approved procedures.
One of the logistical matters that needs to be addressed initially is the selection of a GM Executive
Search Committee. This GMES Committee has historically been appointed in order to facilitate a more
timely selection process. Were the full Board to act as a Committee of the Whole in this process it is
reasonably anticipated that significantly more time, and conceivably more cost, would be required. The
GMES Committee would to facilitate and focus the Board’s process, with a view toward concluding the
work in the most expeditious, effective and economical way possible, at all times being subject to the
Board and not charged with responsibility for making final selection decisions.
And as was true in 2010 and in 2015, transparency, diversity and inclusion should be the guideposts for
any process adopted by the Board.
Let the discussion begin.

Local Government Liaison Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Communications and Government Relations Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to enter into an agreement for Local
Government Liaison services with CRL Associates, Inc. (CRL) to exercise the first option year (January
1, 2020 through December 31, 2020) to extend Contract No. 16-DO-025, at a cost of $105,000.
Funding for this contract is included in the annual budget.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #5 – Effective Communications & Community Outreach
BACKGROUND
In September 2016, RTD issued a Request for Proposals for Local Government Liaison Services. Eight
potential bidders looked at the RFP, but only one responded to this request. The procurement panel
recommended to the Communications and Government Relations Committee the selection of CRL
Associates, Inc. as RTD’s Local Government Liaison with the elected officials and staff of the cities and
counties of the Denver metropolitan area, as well as the business community and economic development
organizations. This team has broad knowledge of RTD, its history, programs and issues, as well as an
extensive network of relationships with local government entities, elected officials, and key stakeholders
along the Front Range. The proposal was submitted for the period of January 1, 2017 through
December 31, 2019, with the potential for two (2) one-year options. The Communications and
Government Relations Committee will make future annual recommendations to the Board of Directors at
the end of each contract period regarding the exercise of future option periods, and this action relates to
the First Option of this contract.
DISCUSSION
CRL Associates, Inc. as RTD’s Local Government Liaison maintains contact with the elected officials and
staff of the cities and counties of the Denver metropolitan area, as well as the business community and
economic development organizations. This team has a broad knowledge of RTD’s needs and issues, as
well as an extensive network of relationships with local governments, elected officials, and key
stakeholders in the Denver metro region. The CRL team has capably represented RTD’s local
government interests and has been an effective strategic partner in the agency’s local stakeholder
coalition building.
As part of the Local Government Liaison services, frequent contact will be made with RTD staff and
board members to ascertain a coordinated plan to monitor and report on activities at the city and county
levels of government. In addition, as part of the coordinated plan, CRL will provide regular outreach to
the business community and economic development organizations in the Metro area to develop
partnerships and garner feedback on RTD issues. CRL will represent RTD at meetings at the local level
of government and provide professional advice, counsel, and analysis of issues regarding local

Packet Pg. 69

2.B.1

government activities as they relate to RTD. CRL will also provide Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC)
liaison services.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for the first option year ($105,000) are included in the annual budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Communications and Government
Relations Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to
enter into an agreement for Local Government Liaison services with CRL Associates, Inc. (CRL) to
exercise the first option year (January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020) to extend Contract
No. 16-DO-25, at a cost of $105,000. Funding for this contract is included in the annual budget.
2.

Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to enter into an
agreement to exercise the first option year on the contract for the Local Government Liaison
services. A new Request for Proposals could be sent to interested parties, and a new Local
Government Liaison firm could be retained. This action is not recommended because CRL
Associates, Inc. has been very effective in assisting RTD with local government matters in the
past, and has extensive knowledge of RTD’s programs, issues and policies and is able to guide
strategy at the local government level.

On-Vehicle Advertising Contract Extension

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Communications & Government Relations Committee that the General
Manager or his designee be authorized to exercise a contract extension with Lamar Advertising of
Denver (Lamar) for the one-year period January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020.
The proposed extension would include one “activation” option.
In the event RTD is unable to select a contractor(s) for a combined On-Vehicle and Digital System
Advertising Contract by July 31, 2020, RTD would extend the period of performance one year, January
1, 2021 through December 31, 2021.
Under the terms of the recommended action, Lamar would remit to RTD either 1) a minimum guarantee
of $3.4 million in 2020 and $3.4 million minimum guarantee for the activation period in 2021; or 2)
sixty percent of net sales, whichever is greater.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Task Goal #1 – Fiscal Sustainability
BACKGROUND
On October 28, 2014, RTD awarded Lamar the On-vehicle Advertising Contract 14DO005. This
contract provided for an initial three-year agreement with a two-year option for 2018 and 2019. RTD
exercised the option years in 2017, to extend the agreement to the end of 2019.
In December of 2018, RTD issued an RFP for Digital Advertising and received two proposals. Following
a thorough evaluation of both proposals received and taking into consideration the numerous questions
received during the procurement, RTD decided to cancel the solicitation for Digital Advertising and
develop a more robust and financially lucrative system advertising approach. This approach would
combine the On-Vehicle Advertising Program with a Digital Public Information and Advertising Program
into one larger comprehensive program. Staff will develop a new advertising RFP to include on-vehicle
advertising and digital public information and advertising as a way to enhance the delivery of customer
information and optimize advertising revenues through RTD’s assets.
In order to continue the On-Vehicle Advertising Program while the new procurement proceeds, staff
recommends extending the current contract utilizing the same terms currently in effect for an additional
year to provide staff the opportunity to combine the On-Vehicle and Digital RFPs and procure a new
contract in 2020. The “activation” option provides both RTD and Lamar with a seamless means to
continue the advertising program during the new advertising RFP process.

Packet Pg. 71

2.B.2

DISCUSSION
Lamar has performed well under the terms of the agreement. Regular operations to sell, produce, install,
maintain and remove on-vehicle advertising are proceeding in an acceptable manner. Consistent
communication between RTD and Lamar occurs to address any questions or challenges. Lamar has
coordinated with RTD and Denver Transit Partners on the implementation of advertising on commuter rail
service initiated during the primary three-year term. Lamar delivers the minimum revenue guarantee to
RTD at the beginning of each contract year.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
In 2020, the minimum revenue will be $3.4M each year. In 2021, the minimum guarantee will be $3.4
million for the “activation”. Lamar has delivered the minimum revenue guarantee each year without
incident.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Award a contract extension to Lamar Advertising of Denver for the exclusive sale of exterior
advertising on RTD buses, light rail and commuter rail vehicles and for the non-exclusive sale of
interior advertising on RTD buses, light rail and commuter rail vehicles, for a one-year period
January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020 to include one “activation” option.
In the event RTD does not select a contractor(s) for a combined On-Vehicle and Digital System
Advertising Agreement before July 31, 2020, the “activation” option would initiate, extending the
performance period for an additional year from January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021.
Under the terms of this recommended action, Lamar would remit to RTD either 1) a minimum
guarantee of $3.4 million in 2020 and $3.4 million minimum guarantee for the activation period in
2021; or 2) sixty percent of net sales, whichever is greater. This is the staff recommendation.
2. Do not award a contract extension to Lamar Advertising of Denver and reissue the RFP. This
alternative is not recommended because 1) there will be a lapse in the agency’s system
advertising program 2) Lamar has performed under the terms of the agreement in the initial threeyears of the agreement and 3) the contract minimum revenue guarantees proposed by Lamar
exceeded the minimum guarantee required in the RFP and would be a lost revenue stream for the
agency.

Revised System Advertising Policy

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Communications and Government Relations Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors approve the revision to the RTD System Advertising Policy. The revisions bring the policy up
to date to reflect current trends and factors that impact advertising policy. The proposed policy
(attached) provides two specific updates from the previous version:
1. Includes stations, buildings, facilities and properties as well as RTD’s electronic
communications channels to expand the assets available for advertising.
2. Formally prohibits the advertising of cannabis and electronic cigarette products on RTD
assets.
The first revision is needed in order to provide the forum for RTD to entertain proposals for digital
advertising. The second revision formally excludes cannabis as a product allowable for advertising on
RTD properties. Despite not being excluded previously, RTD has not entertained any cannabis
advertising to date.
This recommended action supports the General Manager’s 2019 goals – Task Goal #1 – Fiscal
Sustainability
BACKGROUND
In August of 2015, RTD adopted the current System Advertising Policy. At this time, with the proposed
introduction of digital advertising, the Communications and Government Relations Committee is
recommending updating the advertising policy to reflect these changes in advertising media and
locations. This recommendation maintains the current commercial advertising standards adopted in
2015 and applies them to a wider array of advertising options across RTD’s assets. Further, excluding
the advertising of cannabis on the system maintains RTD’s good standing with regard to federal funding.
DISCUSSION
The recommended change to the RTD System Advertising Policy would maintain uniform, reasonable,
and viewpoint-neutral standards for the display of advertising in and on the vehicles, stations, buildings,
facilities and properties of the Regional Transportation District and its affiliated and subsidiary agencies
(together "RTD") and maintain the property as a limited public forum by excluding advertising of a noncommercial nature.
By accepting paid advertising for display in and on RTD property, the RTD is acting in a proprietary
capacity as a provider of public transportation seeking to maximize advertising revenue to support its
transportation operations.

Packet Pg. 73

2.B.3

In furtherance of the RTD's purpose of maximizing advertising revenue, the RTD in its proprietary
capacity would limit advertisements it will accept for display across the agency’s assets to paid
commercial advertising, certain public service announcements and messages that will help build goodwill
for the RTD among its riders and the public, and governmental partners. The RTD would continue to
retain control over the advertising that it will allow to be displayed in and on the system.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Adopt the change to the System Advertising Policy. This alternative is recommended to reflect
important updates to the policy to reflect current trends and factors that impact advertising policy.
Also, the update allows RTD to add digital advertising to the advertising program and provide a
new revenue stream for the agency. This alternative is the staff recommendation.
2. Retain the existing System Advertising Policy. This alternative is not recommended because it
doesn’t align with the agency’s desire to add digital advertising to its advertising program and
generate additional revenues for the agency.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
RTD is preparing a more robust and financially lucrative system advertising approach. This approach
would combine the On-Vehicle Advertising Program with a Digital Public Information and Advertising
Program into one larger comprehensive program. This more comprehensive advertising program will
enhance the delivery of customer information and optimize advertising revenues through RTD’s assets.
Adoption of the Revised System Advertising Policy will allow this RFP to be published and RTD to assess
the value of proposals from prospective vendors. Without this change, RTD will not be able pursue
enhanced digital advertising and will have to forego the increased revenue that is expected through
digital advertising.

Local Government Relations Update

Below is our update for December 2019:
1. Governor’s Transportation Summit on Funding – Governor Polis convened 100 or so
transportation professionals, elected officials and industry leaders on November 5 to a
funding discussion and update on various groups exploring transportation funding strategies
through regional and other approaches. Dave Genova and Director Guissinger were
present from RTD. There were two presentations of interest to RTD: (1) a representative
of the Southwest Chief & Front Range Passenger Rail Commission presented information
regarding the Front Range Passenger Rail Feasibility Study and other multimodal options
linking Pueblo, Colorado Springs and Fort Collins to Denver; (2) Catherine Marinelli
presented an update on the Metro Mayors Caucus’s proposed Enhanced MPO (EMPO).
There were some pointed comments related to RTD from legislators present and concerns
expressed about both the Rail Study and EMPO proposal. A follow up summit is likely to
be held in December, but no date has been announced.
2. Metro Mayors Caucus Transportation and Mobility Committee –The Metro Mayors
Caucus Transportation and Mobility Committee met on November 14. Although RTD
wasn’t on the published agenda, there was considerable discussion about how the MMC
could engage with RTD in a constructive manner to provide input into the ongoing
discussions around structure, capacity and service. The next meeting will be on Friday,
December 13. The agenda will include a discussing a process for engaging with RTD in
2020, as well as updates on possible areas of focus for MobilityNEXT and on their
EMPO proposal which the Board heard about from Jacquie Millet in October. There is
concern both within the region and the state as to the possible implications of the EMPO
and we will continue to monitor the discussion.
3. Metro Mayors Caucus Annual Retreat – The Metro Mayors Caucus Annual Retreat is
scheduled for 9-noon on Saturday, January 11, 2020 at the Opera Colorado Opera Center,
located at 4121 S Navajo St, Englewood, CO 80110, We expect transportation/transit to
be one of the primary discussion items on the agenda. It should be noted that the retreat
will be the first meeting of the Caucus since 10 new mayors were elected.

Re:

End of Year Update

The 2019 interim legislative season has been very busy and given the increased interest in RTD
operations by legislators BBMK has spent much of our time focused on continuing to educate
legislators on issues of importance to the District as well as providing opportunities for RTD’s
staff and Board members to engage with State elected officials.
BBMK has been participating in transportation funding conversations at the Capitol both with
the Governor’s Office and various legislators interested in looking at potential transportation
funding options. BBMK has also monitored multiple legislative interim committees focusing on
draft proposals which could have an operational impact to RTD.
The following is a summary of our work to date:
•

BBMK monitored and provided detailed reports on the work of the following Interim
Committees: The Transportation Legislation Review Committee (TLRC), SB 239,
Impacts of Emerging Technologies stakeholder group meetings, Sales and Use Tax
Simplification Task Force, Family and Medical Leave (FAMLI) Task Force, and the
Tax Expenditure Evaluation Interim Study Committee. Attached at the end of this
report is a list of the bills approved by Legislative Council on November 15 that came
out of interim committees we monitored on the District’s behalf.

•

BBMK organized a call at the request of Speaker KC Becker to discuss her questions
about sales tax collection data kept at RTD within each specific RTD district. General
Manager Dave Genova, CFO Heather McKillop, Sherry Ellebracht and Director
Guissinger participated in this call. RTD staff is preparing a response to the questions
raised by the Speaker and a follow up meeting has been scheduled to present
information from staff to her in December.

•

At the request of the Transportation Legislative Review Committee, BBMK worked
with Senior Staff to arrange a tour of the 61AV project on September 27th. The tour
highlighted the District’s commitment to include innovation in future transportation
planning. Legislators in attendance included Representatives Matt Gray, Monica Duran,
Meg Froelich and Senators Faith Winter, Dennis Hisey and Kevin Priola. Board
Members in attendance included Board Chair Doug Tisdale, Directors Peggy Catlin,
Lynn Guissinger, Angie Malipede, Vince Buzek and Troy Whitmore. General Manager
Dave Genova, Sherry Ellebracht and Bruce Abel were also present.

•

BBMK attended a meeting with Senator Priola and other transportation stakeholders on
October 7th to discuss potential legislation to increase the gas tax in order to raise

BBMK at the request of Rep. Shannon Bird (Westminster) worked with RTD Senior
Staff to coordinate a tour of the B Line as part of the Colorado Competitive Council’s
(C3) October 22-23 legislative trip. This trip included Senator Dennis Hisey, Senator
Rob Woodward, Rep. Marc Snyder, Rep. Colin Larson, and Rep. Kerry Tipper as well
as local elected officials along the North Line. Bill Sirois gave an update to the group
on RTD activities in the area. RTD Directors Shelley Cook, Lynn Guissinger, Angie
Malipede were invited guests of the Colorado Competitive Council (C3).

•

BBMK coordinated RTD’s presentation in front of the TLRC for General Manager
Dave Genova and Board Chair Doug Tisdale. Prior to this presentation, BBMK met
with TLRC Chair Rep. Matt Gray to provide an update on the District’s presentation.
RTD Board Directors Shelley Cook, Lynn Guissinger, Kate Williams, Angie Malipede,
Peggy Catlin and Chair Doug Tisdale attended the meeting.

•

BBMK was invited by House Speaker KC Becker to attend a meeting on transportation
funding solutions. The Speaker challenged stakeholders to look for potential funding
solutions which could generate new revenue and options that could garner bi-partisan
support. CDOT Director Shoshana Lew, Chairs of the Transportation committees,
lobbyists for the business community and Cary Kennedy, Senior Advisor for Fiscal
Policy from the Polis Administration along with invited guests General Manager
Genova and Director Guissinger attended the meeting.

•

RTD Government relations Chair Director Guissinger requested that BBMK invite Joint
Budget Committee Members Senator Dominick Moreno, Senator Rachel Zenzinger,
Rep. Chris Hansen and Rep. Kim Ransom to attend the December 17th RTD Board
meeting. JBC members who represent areas within the RTD district boundaries have
been invited to share an overview of the State budget as well as various proposals that
might be introduced during the 2020 legislative session on transportation funding.

•

BBMK has set up a regular monthly scheduled telephone town hall call where we invite
all 100 State legislators to hear from RTD Senior Staff, RTD Board Chair Doug Tisdale
and Government Relations Chair Director Lynn Guissinger. The goal of the town hall
call is to provide a regular forum for legislators to ask questions of RTD and for the
District to share updates on our most recent activities. The first call was held on
November 7 and the following legislators phoned in: Senator Jeff Bridges, Senator
Faith Winter, Rep. Matt Gray and Rep. Brianna Titone. The next call is schedule for
December 12 at 3pm.

•

BBMK continues to coordinate meetings with Board Members and elected officials.
These are courtesy introductory meetings with the goal of enhancing relationships
between Board Members and State elected officials. To date we have met with the

• Due to partisan gridlock over funding for a southern border wall, impeachment
proceedings, and other issues, none of the 12 spending bills for FY 2020 (which began
October 1) has been passed.
• Federal government is operating under its second Continuing Resolution (CR) of the
fiscal year, funding agencies and programs through midnight on December 20.
• This larger partisan environment has affected normally bipartisan transportation:
• Delayed FY 2020 transit formula apportionments: Making grants to 2,000 recipients
is time-consuming work, so FTA generally will not apportion transit formula funds
under any spending bill shorter than five months.
• Partisan surface transportation legislation: In a major break with Committee

tradition, House T & I Chairman DeFazio is drafting his own surface transportation
authorization bill, without his Republican counterparts.
•

Greatest area of disagreement is over measures to address climate change.

• House appropriators, while sympathetic, view this as the Senate’s problem to

fix.
• Tailwinds:
• Bipartisan Congressional delegation – important with a divided Congress.
• Bicameral support of our delegation.
• Senate FY 2020 THUD bill was gutted to serve as vehicle for the latest CR, so

• Deadline: Congress must pass one or more spending bills before December 20 expiration of the
current short-term Continuing Resolution.
• Aim is to pass omnibus (or multiple mini-buses) to fund all departments and programs of
the Federal government for the remainder of the fiscal year.
• Transit spending levels: House and Senate have each passed their FY 2020 THUD spending
bills, but have not reconciled the two bills.
• Under the CR: Short-term extension of robust FY 2019 levels for transit formula programs
under FAST Act, yet no formula funding apportioned by FTA until full-year bill is in place.
• Under FY 2020 THUD Bills: House and Senate FY 2020 bills both fully fund transit formula

programs at their FY 2020 FAST Act level: $10.15 billion.
• BUILD (TIGER) funding: $1 billion in House and Senate bills, above FY 2019 enacted level

of $900 million.
• New Starts (CIG) funding:
• Trump Administration, Senate, and House all propose funding CIG program at lower
than FY 2019 enacted level of $2.55 billion:
• Administration: $1.50 billion to fund only projects with signed FFGAs.
• House: $2.30 billion.

• The FAST Act expires September 30, 2020.
• Neither the House nor the Senate has announced a schedule for moving comprehensive
reauthorization legislation by then.
• Senate EPW Committee: Only committee taking action to date – reported out a bipartisan

highway bill in August.
• Robust authorization levels unsupportable by current revenues.
• Largest hurdle, by far, is how to pay for the programs after the end of the FAST Act, as

spending has outpaced Highway Trust Fund revenues since FY 2008.
• Same politically-difficult revenue options remain, made harder in an election year.
• Earmarks would help build support for a revenue increase.
• House Ways and Means and Senate Finance Committees are responsible for

revenues, not the authorizing committees.
• So there is a little/no connection between what will be included in
transportation authorization bills and what can actually be paid for with current
revenues.
• Stakeholders should prepare for short-term extension(s) of the FAST Act, as was the case
at the end of MAP-21.

• One area of common ground?
• Democrats have recently revived efforts to move a large infrastructure bill.

• They are vulnerable to attacks from Republicans that they cannot get anything done

during impeachment, while President Trump has repeatedly stated he can work with
Democrats on infrastructure.
• Both sides proposed $1 trillion-plus funding levels with no viable proposals on how to
fund a bill that large.
• Democrats want to show they can govern:
• Envision a large bill, funding projects across many sectors, from transportation to
schools to broadband.
• Rejected Trump’s earlier infrastructure proposal as lacking new revenues, over reliant
on finance tools and P3s, and undermining transit and environmental protections.
• Republicans expect Trump to find the funds:
• In the Senate, no interest, time, or energy to move a broad bill; Senate committees
focused on individual bills to address surface transportation (highways/transit/rail),
water resources, and autonomous vehicles.
• Congressional Republicans have made clear that the President must lead on this
legislation, particularly on how to fund it.

•

Senate races in 2020 include Senator Gardner’s reelection:
• First-term Senator is expected to have a tough race.
• His race is one of four in the Senate considered a “toss up” at this time.
• Since his election, Coloradans supported Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump in 2018
by 5 percentage points and Democrats flipped Colorado’s 6th Congressional district
in 2018.
• Senator Gardner is the only member of our delegation serving on a transportation
committee in Congress.
• Impact of Senator Gardner loss could be lessened if Democrats flip the US Senate.
• Republicans will be defending 23 seats in 2020, while Democrats will be defending
just 12.
• Increasingly unlikely to get funding increases needed for FAST Act reauthorization or broad
infrastructure package as elections approach – few Member of Congress want to take a
“tough” vote to raise taxes.
• A FAST Act extension, rather than reauthorization, is more likely.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

Date: November 26, 2019

From:

Henry
Stopplecamp,
Assistant
Manager, Capital Programs

GM

Date:

Subject:

Amend Iliff Initial Parking Management IGA
with Aurora

General

Board Meeting Date:

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager and/or his designee to negotiate and execute all documents
necessary to amend an existing agreement with the City of Aurora (Intergovernmental Agreement
Between the City of Aurora and the Regional Transportation District for the Initial Parking Management
Plan for the Iliff Parking Garage, the “Parking Pilot IGA”) to extend the term of the IGA for an additional
two years. With this action, the IGA would terminate in February 2022.
This action addresses the General Manager’s Core Goal #5 for 2019: Effective Communications &
Community Outreach and Task Goal #4 – Address Future Transportation Needs and Methods.
BACKGROUND
The recommended action would not alter RTD’s obligations under the separate RTD and City of Aurora I225 Rail Line Iliff Station Parking Structure Intergovernmental Agreement (“Iliff Station Parking Structure
IGA”) which details annual operations and maintenance payments from RTD to Aurora. The Iliff Station
Parking Structure IGA was negotiated to fulfill Aurora’s desire to have a parking structure instead of two
surface lots that were in the FasTracks plan. This was conceived as a mutually beneficial partnership
that would accelerate development and enhance ridership long term at no additional cost to RTD with
the same 600 parking spaces available for RTD patrons.
Aurora seeks to, in part, offset its significant investment in the garage by implementing charges for
parking at this facility. Since the 600 spaces were reserved for RTD, the IGA requires that any such
parking plan receive approval in advance by the RTD Board of Directors in the Board’s sole discretion.
The IGA also specifies that a contingency financial plan should be developed by Aurora in the event a
proposed parking plan is not approved by the RTD Board. In the same spirit, the Iliff Garage Land lease
provided that the land upon which the parking structure is located be leased by RTD to Aurora at no
cost, and that the parties shall address revenue generation issues as a part of a parking management
plan.
The Parking Pilot IGA requires that Aurora adjust parking fees in order to reach 75% occupancy in the
garage at peak times. In recent months, during which time Aurora charged every user $3 per day,
occupancy has reached approximately 45%. On November 1, 2019, at RTD’s urging, Aurora reduced its
fee to $2 per day in order to comply with the terms laid out in the IGA.
DISCUSSION
Aurora and RTD wish to extend the three year agreement by two years in order to provide ample time to
continue to reduce the parking fee and determine the optimal pricing for parking in the garage.


Term of Original Agreement: 3 Years (February 2017-February 2020).

Packet Pg. 115

3.B.1





Term of Amended Agreement: Additional 2 years (February 2020-February 2022).
Parking Rates: RTD and Aurora will jointly monitor utilization of the garage and adjust pricing with
the common goal of reaching 75% occupancy.
Replacement Agreement: Six months prior to the IGA’s full term, Aurora and RTD will begin good
faith negotiations to negotiate a replacement agreement to be submitted to the RTD Board of
Directors for consideration.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
There would be no direct financial impact to RTD because this action would not alter RTD’s obligations
under the separate Iliff Station Parking Structure IGA which details annual operations and maintenance
payments from RTD to Aurora. However, reducing the parking charges at the parking structure to
increase usage of the RTD parking could result in increased ridership on trains and buses serving the Iliff
Station.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs &
FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager and/or his
designee to negotiate and execute all documents necessary to amend an existing agreement with
the City of Aurora (Intergovernmental Agreement Between the City of Aurora and the Regional
Transportation District for the Initial Parking Management Plan for the Iliff Parking Garage, the
“Parking Pilot IGA”) to extend the term of the IGA for an additional two years. With this action,
the IGA would terminate in February 2022.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not extend the Parking Pilot IGA, and allow the
current IGA to expire in February 2020. This is not recommended because the parking pilot IGA
was interrupted by a change in parking leadership at Aurora and not fully realized. Not accepting
this action would prevent Aurora from charging at this station in February, as board approval is a
requirement for charging RTD patrons.

RTD Boundary Certification & Director District
Designation

Assistant

General

Board Meeting Date:

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the revised boundary map of the District and authorize the Board Secretary to certify the
boundary map and description. It is further recommended that the areas newly annexed to RTD
pursuant to the provisions of CRS 32-9-106 be designated as follows:
1. The ten Aurora annexations – Bravada/Neher Annexation, Cottonwood Creek Annexation No.1,
Cottonwood Creek Annexation No. 2, Cottonwood Creek Annexation No. 3, Cottonwood Creek
Annexation No. 4, Watkins Road Annexation No. 2, Watkins Road Annexation No. 3, Watkins
Road II Annexation No. 1, Watkins Road II Annexation No. 2 and the Walnut Peacemaker
Annexation – are recommended to be included in Director District F (Director Broom); and
2. The seven Parker annexations – Heirloom Parkway Property Serial I and Heirloom Parkway Serial
II, Chambers Road & Main Street Tract P, Chambers Road & Public Service Company Right-ofWay, Chambers Road No. 1, Chambers Road No. 2 and Chambers Road No. 3 – are
recommended to be included in Director District G (Director Mihalik).
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management
BACKGROUND
HB 1295-07 requires that the District revise its boundary map and legal description following any
changes to the District’s boundary. Further, pursuant to CRS 32-9-106.6 (b), any area annexed by an inDistrict municipality on or after May 25, 1994, is automatically included in the District. The revised RTD
boundary map and legal description must be approved by the RTD Board and the RTD Board Secretary
must certify the map and legal description to the State and appropriate county. Additionally, the Board
must assign the newly annexed areas to specific Director Districts.
Over the last year, the City of Aurora and the Town of Parker have finalized several annexations as listed
in the table below:

The land involved in these annexations encompasses approximately 3,062 acres or approximately 4.8
square miles. With the exception of one farmstead located in the Cottonwood Creek Annexation No. 3,
all of the Aurora properties in these annexations are undeveloped or farmland. In the case of the
Heirloom Parkway annexations, all of the land is solely Town of Parker right-of-way. The Chambers
Road annexations are all for right-of-way and utility purposes.
All of the Aurora annexations are in Southeast Aurora in the general vicinity of Jewel Avenue and
Watkins Road adjacent to Director District F. Currently no transit services exist in this general area of the
District. Any future provisions for service would be reviewed by RTD Service Development as the area
grows out. One set of the Parker annexations are where Heirloom Parkway intersects with Hess Road,
adjacent to District G (Director Mihalik). The other set of the Parker annexations are in the vicinity of
South Chambers Road and Main Street. See the individual annexation maps attached to this report.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
No financial impact is associated with this action. It should be noted, however, that as these properties
develop, depending on the mix of uses, they will generate sales tax revenue for the District.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs &
FasTracks Committee that the Board of Directors approve the revised boundary map of the
District and authorize the Board Secretary to certify the boundary map and description. It is
further recommended that the areas newly annexed to RTD pursuant to the provisions of CRS 329-106 be designated as follows:
a. The ten Aurora annexations – Bravada/Neher Annexation, Cottonwood Creek Annexation

William C. Van Meter,
Manager, Planning

GM

Date:

State Highway (SH) 119 Planning

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors accept the Multimodal Corridor Vision for the SH 119 corridor as defined in the Planning and
Environmental Linkages (PEL) document, which was accepted by the Federal Transit Administration
(FTA) and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) on October 22, 2019. RTD has currently
committed $30 million to the transit elements of the corridor through the Mid-Term Financial Plan. It is
also recommended that the Board of Directors support the transit elements of the PEL’s Multimodal
Corridor Vision. Further, the RTD Board affirms that the $30 million RTD commitment will be used solely
for implementation of transit elements and directs staff to pursue grant opportunities, partnerships and
other opportunities to leverage this commitment to that end.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management
Task Goal #4 Address Future Transportation Needs
BACKGROUND
RTD initiated the Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS), in April 2013 to develop consensus among
RTD, the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) and the Northwest-area stakeholders, including
local jurisdictions and businesses, on cost effective and efficient mobility improvements to serve the
Northwest area, recognizing that RTD could not complete the Northwest Rail Corridor in the near- or
medium-term timeframe. On June 24, 2014, the Board approved a resolution which accepted the Final
Consensus Statement as developed by the NAMS stakeholders for priorities within the Northwest Study
Area. One of the highest priorities, as described in the Final Consensus Statement, was to proceed into
advanced planning, environmental review and preliminary engineering to establish Bus Rapid Transit
(BRT) in the SH 119 Corridor between Longmont and Boulder.
The NAMS recommendation for BRT in the corridor assumed a bus-on-shoulder type operation. The
capital cost to establish BRT with a bus-on-shoulder operation was estimated to be approximately $60
million dollars. Staff assumed that grants could provide funding for approximately half of this cost.
Accordingly, the Mid-Term Financial Plan (MTFP) includes $30 million in Base System funds in 2023.
In September 2017, RTD, in collaboration with CDOT, DRCOG and local jurisdictional stakeholders,
began the SH 119 environmental and preliminary engineering process. During the alternatives evaluation
phase it became clear that CDOT and local stakeholders wanted to focus more on person-through-put for
the corridor than just a single transit improvement – which a bus-on-shoulder operation would have
provided. Consequently, the PEL’s recommended vision for the corridor includes BRT/Managed Lanes,
which would be used by buses, high-occupancy-vehicles (HOV) and toll-paying autos; a bikeway, which

Packet Pg. 144

3.B.3

would generally run in the highway median between Longmont and Boulder; and, several transit
elements as listed below:






New and upgraded stations and Park-n-Rides;
Additional service for the corridor;
Queue jumps (bus bypass lanes) throughout the corridor;
Business access/turn (BAT) lanes along 28th in Boulder; and
Coffman Street busway in Longmont.

The transit elements are consistent with the presentation that was provided to the Planning/Capital
Programs & FasTracks Committee on October 8, 2019. A copy of that presentation is attached to this
report.
The project was governed by a Policy Advisory Committee, comprised of elected officials, including
Directors Lubow and Guissinger; and a Technical Advisory Committee, comprised of staff members from
CDOT, DRCOG and local jurisdictions. The project team held three rounds of public meetings, which
included two meetings per round: one generally on the Boulder end of the corridor and one on the
Longmont end of the corridor’s BRT/Managed Lanes. One additional joint meeting with Boulder County
was held in Niwot. RTD also surveyed existing corridor riders via a survey on the Bolt and the J routes;
and RTD provided an on-line questionnaire on the project’s website to solicit additional feedback from
the general public.
RTD, with extensive guidance from CDOT, packaged the final corridor vision into the PEL. On October
22, 2019, FTA and FHWA provided a letter accepting the SH 119 PEL. The total cost for the full
corridor vision as described in the PEL is estimated to be approximately $255 million.
DISCUSSION
With the completion of the PEL and preliminary design work, RTD can now work with CDOT and the
local stakeholders to begin implementation of the project elements. CDOT has begun a Traffic and
Revenue study to determine the potential revenue that tolling in the corridor could provide. As the
planning and environmental process is concluding, funding from several other sources, including CDOT,
DRCOG and local jurisdictions, has been identified for the corridor.
As noted, the transit elements for the project are consistent with those provided in the presentation to
the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee on October 8, 2019, attached to this report.
Project construction for the RTD-funded transit elements could occur within the 2023 to 2025
timeframe. Future Board action would be required to obligate the final programming of RTD’s $30
million. Since some of the other sources of funding, noted above, will be available sooner than 2023,
RTD can work with our partners on the final design and construction of those project elements but
cannot contribute funding until 2023. RTD has supported local stakeholders in securing grants for the
corridor through leveraging of RTD’s funds. Along those lines, local stakeholders have requested that
RTD accelerate the programming of $5 million in the Mid-Term Financial Plan to either 2020 or 2021 in
order to leverage additional outside funds.
The proposed action fits within the General Manager Goal of Strong Financial Management, specifically
the sub goal of Address Future Transportation Needs, as the eventual completion of BRT in the SH 119
corridor will increase service reliability, ridership and cost effectiveness of the service.

3.B.3

FINANCIAL IMPACT
RTD’s $30 million in funding for the corridor is identified in 2023 in the Mid-Term Financial Plan. As
noted, all other funding for the corridor is assumed to be from other agencies and grants.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs &
FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of Directors accept the Multimodal Corridor Vision for
the SH 119 corridor as defined in the Planning and Environmental Linkages (PEL) document,
which was accepted by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) and the Federal Highway
Administration (FHWA) on October 22, 2019. RTD has currently committed $30 million to the
transit elements of the corridor through the Mid-Term Financial Plan. It is also recommended that
the Board of Directors support the transit elements of the PEL’s Multimodal Corridor Vision.
Further, the RTD Board affirms that the $30 million RTD commitment will be used solely for
implementation of transit elements and directs staff to pursue grant opportunities, partnerships
and other opportunities to leverage this commitment to that end.
2. Do not accept the Multimodal Corridor Vision for the SH 119 corridor as defined in the Planning
and Environmental Linkage (PEL) document, which was accepted by the Federal Transit
Administration (FTA) and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) on October 22, 2019. This
action is not recommended since it will delay the implementation of a project that is meant to
address the mobility needs in the Northwest region.

Proposed Regional
BRT Network
Based on input from stakeholders across the
region, it became clear that many communities
within RTD are interested in BRT. The primary
outcome of this Feasibility Study was the
development of an integrated network of BRT
routes throughout the district, as depicted in blue
and white on this map.
Note: BRT routes along Colfax Avenue and SH 119
are included in DRCOG’s 2040 fiscally constrained
Metro Vision Regional Transportation Plan. As
such, they were assumed to be part of the
regional BRT network and did not receive further
evaluation during this study.

The Denver metro area’s
population, and the travel
demands of that population,
continue to grow at a rapid
pace. By 2040, the Regional
Transportation District may
serve a need more than double
its current level. Recognizing
the need to explore new
service types in order to serve
this demand, RTD undertook
this Regional BRT Feasibility
Study. Through a datadriven evaluation process,
supplemented with extensive
stakeholder engagement,
an integrated, district-wide
network of potential BRT routes
that would substantially expand
the reach of high-frequency
transit throughout the region
has been envisioned for future
investment.

that analysis outcomes align with the needs and vision of the region.

• Provides connectivity and access
• Increases ridership
• Enhances expandability, equity, and
sustainability
• Ensures cost-effectiveness
• Aligns with state and local agency
recommendations

• Considers technological innovation/

BRT Network Development

3.C.1.b

The BRT network includes:
• Corridors with the highest potential to support high quality, high
frequency bus service
• Corridors in communities that have demonstrated substantial
support through study, design, and/or financial commitment
• Corridors with high ridership potential that can operate on an
existing semi-exclusive travelway (i.e., toll lanes, managed lanes,
high-occupancy vehicle lanes) and can therefore be implemented
more cost effectively
The proposed BRT network includes 23 routes for continued
evaluation and development by local agencies with support from RTD.
While some of the envisioned BRT routes have a demonstrated need today, others
are currently developing and need is based on future land use and travel demand.
Other factors that influence the timing of BRT implementation include available
ROW, existing policies, partnerships, and coordination, existing transit-supportive
policies, and route-specific studies. The table below provides a qualitative
assessment of each corridor’s readiness.

3.C.1.b

Identify Congestion and/or Delay
In Tier 2, we evaluated the 29 corridors developed in Tier 1 to determine which corridors have the most
potential for travel time and reliability improvement. These are the locations where congestion is
precluding competitive transit travel times and improving the travel time has the opportunity to capture
higher ridership. Tier 2 evaluation relied heavily on metrics provided by RTD's regional travel model.

Evaluation Metrics
• BRT boardings per revenue mile

• BRT passenger-miles traveled per revenue mile
• Percent of corridor that is severely congested
Other Metrics considered but not included in the analysis include:
• Boardings
• New system-wide boardings
• Line load compared to congested roadway

TIER 2

Packet Pg. 180

3.C.1.b

The two primary evaluation criteria for Tier 3 were community support for BRT and the
potential physical viability of a corridor for BRT investment.

Evaluation Metrics
Community Support

Community support for transit was informed in two ways –inventorying transit supportive local policies/plans and
identifying community support for BRT through an online survey distributed to local agencies impacted by the
potential BRT routes. The eight corridors in yellow are those that moved into Tier 4.

Physical Viability

An extensive data collection effort informed the potential
of repurposing existing ROW and/or acquiring ROW for BRT
along each of the 14 corridors. Data collected to inform the
analysis included:
• Roadway characteristics (existing ROW, drive lanes,
turn lanes, medians, parking, bike lanes, sidewalks,
access control)

Conclusion

The past decade has seen something
of a transit renaissance. As concerns
about accessibility, equity, safety, and
sustainability in transportation continue
to grow, high-quality public transit service
increasingly stands out as a potential
panacea for an array of 21st century
mobility challenges. Bus Rapid Transit,
in particular, has proliferated throughout
the United States. The combination of
rail-like frequencies and amenities with
the cost efficiencies of traditional rubbertire service makes it a uniquely promising
opportunity for expanding the reach of
high-frequency transit networks. The
regional BRT network envisioned herein
would greatly enhance the convenience,
connectivity, and comfort of transit for the
region’s rapidly growing population and
act as part of the solution for combating
worsening congestion and environmental
health. RTD looks forward to working with
its partners to bring this vision to fruition.

Title VI of The Civil Rights Act of 1964
• Title VI requires that transit agencies
ensure the level and quality of public
transportation service is provided in a
nondiscriminatory manner.
• The FTA requires RTD establish policies
for evaluating fixed-route service
changes to determine whether the
planned changes will have a disparate
impact on the basis of race, color,
national origin or low-income status.

RTD’s Transit Equity
policies define a disparity
as a 10% +/- difference in
impact.

”Differences of race, nationality or religion
should not be used to deny any human being
citizenship rights or privileges.”

Service Quality – Focus on providing very frequent and fast service on a select set of
transit supportive corridors
Social Equity/Community – Focus resources in a manner that provides service to as
many people in need of transit service as possible
Cost/Improve Cost Efficiency – Focus resources on travel markets and patterns to
achieve the highest potential ridership per service hour
Congestion – Focus on corridors with the most vehicular congestion and look to shift
travel to transit
Environment – Focus resources on corridors with high single occupancy vehicle travel
Geographic Coverage – Focus on spreading service out relatively evenly across the
district to maximize the area served by transit
Economy – Focus service in locations that have the potential to encourage economic
development and serve the region’s largest economic generators

PRE-NEPA PLANNING
AND PROJECT
DEVELOPMENT
PROCESS
2019 September - October

The Front Range Passenger Rail project is following an integrated planning process that will directly link with National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requirements for a federal approval by the
US Department of Transportation (USDOT). Federal Railroad Administration, Federal Transit Administration, and Federal
Highway Administration will oversee the activities in the flowchart below: defining the project, stakeholder
coordination, and identification of environmental issues. This upfront involvement will ensure a more efficient NEPA
process.
The USDOT agencies will also work with other federal, state, and local agencies to streamline permitting and project
approvals once NEPA is initiated. This is consistent with Executive Order 13807, issued in 2017 to reduce the average
time to complete required environmental reviews and authorization decisions for major infrastructure projects.

Front Range Passenger Rail Purpose
“Developing passenger rail service in and along the I-25 corridor
is a critical component of Colorado’s future. Front Range
Passenger Rail (FRPR) will provide a safe, efficient, and reliable
transportation option for travel between major population
centers along the Front Range and create a backbone for
expanding rail and transit options in the state.”

Front Range Passenger Rail Study
Objectives
Increased mobility choices for safe and reliable travel along the Front Range
- limited intercity transit options today
• Connect corridor destinations and communities - jobs, shopping,
recreation, health care, leisure
• Address increasing intercity and regional travel demands - effects of
population growth and increasing congestion on major highways
• Provide a mode choice for our changing demographics and corresponding
transportation demands
• Provide an inter-city transportation alternative for low-income and
underserved communities - connect affordable housing to jobs
•

Legislative Options –
Governance
Public Rail Authority: Establishes a statutory tool for local entities to create an
authority over time as planning and funding options arise. This tool is similar to
PHA and RTA enabling statutes but for rail. (Preferred)
Front Range Rail District: Creates a defined district along the I-25 corridor and
provides a specific governance structure; powers and financing authority would
be detailed in statute.
Rail Enterprise: Could leverage HPTE structure, focused more on fees for
funding; powers and financing authority would depend on statute.
Expand SW Chief/FRPRail Commission: Provide additional scope and authority
to existing Commission to further evaluate above options, along with
appropriation
