BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
2025 Draft Update of the GM/CEO Performance
Assessment Form and Process

May 12, 2025

REPRESENTATIVES
Michael Guzman, Chair, Performance Committee
Christopher Gutschenritter, Vice-Chair, Performance Committee
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Performance Committee has three oversight functions, which are the performance management of
the General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO), the development and ongoing review of long-range strategic
planning efforts, and high-level monitoring of agency performance in relation to the Strategic Plan.
Article VI, Section 1, subsection f. states that “with respect to the performance management of the
GM/CEO, the committee has primary oversight over the GM/CEO’s…annual performance assessment
framework, and annual performance assessment.”
In 2024 the Performance Committee worked with RKL Associates to develop a sustainable and reusable
tool for reviewing the GM/CEO’s performance. On October 7, 2024, the Performance Committee met to
review and provide input on the GM/CEO Assessment form, and those materials are attached to this
report. Subsequently additional changes were mutually agreed upon by Performance Committee and
Board leadership as well as GM/CEO Johnson. RKL designed the form to be completed via the survey
platform Qualtrics® and the results were then compiled and forwarded to the GM/CEO, the Chief People
Officer, and Performance Committee Chair Catlin at the conclusion of the review period. The results
were then subsequently shared with the full Board. As the tool for review (aka – the GM/CEO
Performance Review Evaluation Form) was fully developed, it needs only to be updated annually to
reflect the performance assessment outcome ratings and corresponding point distribution, short-term
goals, and associated Adjusted Base Salary percentage increase for which the GM/CEO is eligible for
that year’s performance period.
On January 28, 2025, the Board of Directors adopted the 2025 performance period assessment
outcome ratings, weighting and point distribution, GM-CEO Short-term Goals, which has been attached
to this report.
Performance Committee leadership is presenting an initial updated draft assessment form, which
incorporates changes to the Performance Assessment Framework and short-term goals adopted by the
Board in January 2025.

Packet Pg. 3

1.C.1

DISCUSSION
It is important to note that the Committee leadership does not intend to create a new performance
method or review tools. Committee leadership remains committed to utilizing the current resource by
making necessary updates as well as internalizing the construction and distribution of the form. In order
for the Committee to prepare, and the full Board of Directors to complete the review in an efficient and
timely manner, the Committee Chair and Vice Chair have engaged with GM/CEO Debra A. Johnson and
Chief People Officer Charlene Polege. Their collaboration has been critical to ensure there is a record of
the process to update the assessment form for the Performance Committee to follow in future years.
Additionally, this collaboration has ensured key steps can be completed in a manner consistent with
RTD’s values.
Committee members are asked to review the attached updated assessment form, which reflects the
2025 performance period assessment outcome ratings, weighting and point distribution, and provide any
feedback.

BACKGROUND
During the January 30, 2024, Board meeting, the Board approved the 2024 General Manager and CEO
Performance Assessment Framework. The approved framework was developed in conversations
between past Chair Lynn Guissinger, current Chair Erik Davidson, the Performance Committee, the
Executive Committee, the Chief People Officer (CPO), and the General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO).
Throughout those conversations a consensus was reached to retain an external consultant to work with
the GM/CEO and the Performance Committee to develop and conduct a 360° Assessment of the
GM/CEO position as well as assist the Board in the development and execution of its final performance
assessment of the GM/CEO.

On March 26, 2024, the Board approved a summary scope of work for consulting services related to the
development and execution of a total Compensation Study, 360° Assessment instrument, and final
assessment tool, and authorized the GM/CEO to enter into a contract for such services. The Board
Office worked with the CPO and RTD’s Contracting and Procurement Division to solicit, via a request for
quotes, qualified firms to develop and deploy a 360° Assessment Tool, as well as create and administer
the final GM/CEO performance assessment. On Tuesday, July 9, 2024, RTD entered into an agreement
with RKL Virtual Management (RKL) to develop and conduct the 360° Assessment and assist the Board
with the final performance assessment of the GM/CEO.

The RKL Team attended and presented at the Performance Committee’s meetings on July 22, 2024,
August 8, 2024, and September 9, 2024, to provide updates on the projects they were selected to
complete. To identify the performance components to be evaluated by the 360° Assessment Tool, RKL
reviewed the GM/CEO’s job description, RTD’s organizational values, interviewed all members of the
Performance Committee, and spoke with GM/CEO Johnson. Additionally, RKL conducted a brief survey
to collect additional feedback from all Directors. Through the feedback received, RKL developed an initial
set of questions to be included in the 360° Assessment Tool, which drive at how the GM/CEO is
performing relative to the Board-approved 2024 General Manager and CEO Performance Assessment
Framework. The initial set of questions has been distributed to Board members and GM/CEO Johnson for

Raters completing the 360° Assessment tool have been set. Three Directors were selected by Board
Chair Erik Davidson and Performance Committee Chair Catlin. Five direct reports to the GM/CEO and
four external raters recommended by the GM/CEO and reviewed by the Committee were randomly
selected at a meeting on Thursday, September 26, 2024, with representatives from RKL, the Board, and

On September 19, 2024, the Board Office circulated a draft final assessment tool to the Board, the
GM/CEO, and the CPO. This draft will eventually become the assessment tool each Director can
complete to assess the GM/CEO’s performance during the current performance cycle. Feedback on this
form was due to the Board office on Wednesday, October 2, 2024. RKL is now in the process of
incorporating that feedback and is seeking any additional feedback during the October 7, 2024,
Performance Committee meeting. The final assessment each Board member will be able to complete will
be distributed to Directors at the end of October 2024. In the meantime, RKL will continue to work with
the Board Office, Board leadership, the GM/CEO, and the CPO to finalize the assessment form. The form
will focus on assessing results in the performance areas agreed to in the Board-approved 2024 General
Manager and CEO Performance Assessment Framework.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve, pursuant to the GM/CEO’s performance framework adopted in
January 2024 in alignment with the Board’s employment agreement with the GM/CEO, the proposed
short-term SMART goals for the performance period commencing January 28, 2025, and continuing
through October 15, 2025.

28

02

BACKGROUND
Pursuant to the performance assessment framework adopted by the Board during the monthly Board
meeting held on January 30, 2024, the Board is responsible for motivating, assessing, and rewarding
the agency’s GM/CEO in relation to short-term (annual) and long-term performance.

Y

The attainment of short-term goals directly tied to agency Strategic Initiatives is a critical element of the
GM/CEO’s annual performance, as is performance related to core job duties and values.

NU

AR

On December 4, 2023, the Board adopted a fifth amendment to the contract to adjust the Board’s
annual deadline to adopt the goals and metrics upon which the GM/CEO will be evaluated in the coming
year from December 31 to January 31. Following an election year, this timing also allows newly elected
Board members an opportunity to participate in the goals and metrics development discussion.

M

For the annual performance periods beginning January 1, 2025, and through the Term Extension,
GM/CEO Johnson is eligible for an increase to the Adjusted Base Salary between 1 and 7% as set
by the Board
By January 31 each year, after consultation with GM/CEO Johnson, the Board must adopt the
Agency Values, Short-term Goals, and performance assessment outcome ratings with
corresponding point distribution for Core/Base Job performance, demonstration of Agency Values,

On December 10, 2024, the Board adopted an eighth amendment to the contract, which included the

and Attainment of Short-term Goals and associated Adjusted Base Salary percentage increase for
which GM/CEO Johnson is eligible for that year’s performance period
Beginning January 1, 2025, the Board must meet with GM/CEO Johnson each quarter to discuss
her performance, including her progress toward the Short-term Goals
For the annual performance periods beginning January 1, 2025, and through the Term Extension,
GM/CEO Johnson is not eligible for a Cost-of-Living Adjustment; however the Board will endeavor
to continue to be guided by the total compensation principles in the Compensation Philosophy

DISCUSSION
In alignment with the Strategic Priorities of Community Value, Customer Excellence, Employee
Ownership, and Financial Success, the purpose of this Recommended Action is to align the committee
around the proposed short-term SMART goals and associated weighting for the performance period
commencing January 28, 2025, and continuing through October 15, 2025 (2025 performance period).

BO

The proposed goals for the 2025 performance period, which are tied to the Strategic Initiatives of
Customer and Community Connections, People Power, and Welcoming Transit Environment, are as
follows:

02

5

Strategic Initiative: Customer and Community Connections – RTD is committed to fostering community
building and enriching the customer experience.

28

,2

Short-term Goal 1: No later than September 30, 2025, to increase light rail service availability
to 96% (50% of goal) and to increase annualized on-time performance for fixed-route bus to
83% (20% of goal), for light rail to 83% (20% of goal), and for commuter rail to 96% (10%
of goal).

Y

Background: This goal aligns with agency efforts to improve performance metrics related to
overall customer satisfaction and perception of on-time performance.

JA

NU

AR

Historically, RTD’s bus and commuter rail service availability metrics have remained above 99%,
meaning that, for every 100 trips scheduled, more than 99 trips are operated. Light rail service
availability has been impacted in recent years due to several factors, including but not limited to
operator availability and state of good repair and preventative maintenance activities. Overall light
rail service availability for 2024 was 94.34%, meaning that, of the 223,205 trips scheduled,
208,412 were actually operated.

FR

O

M

On-time performance is influenced by numerous factors, including elements both within RTD’s
control (e.g., operator availability, scheduling, and maintenance) and outside of it (e.g., regional
traffic patterns and road congestion, service impacts resulting from construction and street
detours, weather, and supply chain issues). Increasing on-time performance by even small
increments requires budgetary support as well as a considerable, concerted effort of Bus and Rail
Operations teams as well as Service Planning, Human Resources, Capital Programs personnel
among others.

For the first 11 months of 2024, average on-time performance for fixed-route service by mode is
as follows:

T

Bus: 80.4%
Light Rail: 77.0%
Commuter Rail: 95.2%

Short-term Goal 2: To achieve total vehicle boardings of 69,562,000 during the period from
October 1, 2024 and ending September 30th, 2025, where the percentage goal achievement
is calculated from a baseline of 66,307,000 boardings.

BO

AR
D

Background: This goal aligns with agency efforts to improve performance metrics tied to
community perceptions of the value RTD provides to the Denver metro region and of RTD’s
provision of service to major activity centers, as well as the State’s visionary ridership increase
goal of 6%.

02

5

RTD continues to optimize service levels and is incrementally approaching the level of service
delivery contemplated in the System Optimization Plan (SOP) adopted by the Board in July 2022.
Funding in calendar year 2025 for the increase in revenue service hours of approximately
102,000 was included in the 2025 Budget, approved by the Board on Tuesday, December 3,
2024.

28

,2

Annual boardings for the period commencing October 1, 2023, through September 30, 2024,
totaled 65,767,000. A 3% year-over-year increase as contemplated in this goal would equate to
nearly 2,000,000 additional boardings, the equivalent of 5,400 additional boardings daily.

AR

Y

*RTD’s estimated 2024 revenue hours totaled 3,089,109. Note that this estimate does not
include demand-response revenue hours.

JA

NU

Strategic Initiative: Welcoming Transit Environment – RTD seeks to reduce the impacts of criminal
behaviors and Code of Conduct violations on agency’s services and workplaces and, in doing so, to
improve community and employee perception of personal and public security on RTD property and
vehicles.

O

M

Short-term Goal 3: To increase customer survey responses by 4% from CY2024 to CY2025
in relation to questions pertaining to customers’ perception of a) feeling safe and secure
while waiting at stops or stations and b) feeling safe and secure aboard vehicles.

FR

Background: This goal aligns with agency efforts to improve performance metrics related to
customers’ perceptions of personal safety and security.

T

Customer Excellence surveys conducted in 2024 indicate that 55% of bus and rail customers felt
personally safe and secure while waiting for fixed-route transit vehicles, and 62% of bus and rail
customers felt personally safe and secure while aboard vehicles. While these responses are
significantly higher than national averages for transit agencies, staff anticipates that an increase
in customer perceptions of safety and security will yield corresponding increases in boardings as
well as customer satisfaction with RTD services.

A draft of these goals is attached for the committee’s consideration during the Performance Committee
meeting scheduled for Tuesday, January 21, 2025. Should the Board not adopt short-term goals for the
GM/CEO by the January 31 deadline specified in the contract, the goals automatically revert to those
adopted for the prior performance period.

AR
D

Additional Goal added during the January 28, 2025 Board Meeting:

BO

Short-term Goal 4: To identify at least four comprehensive Vision Zero strategic initiatives that
are new or innovative to RTD, to be identified no later than October 15, 2025.
At least two strategic initiatives will aim to increase ridership through encouraging
modal shift by reducing barriers to access (50% of goal)

•

At least two strategic initiatives will aim to eliminate traffic fatalities or serious injuries
within RTD's operations and infrastructure. (50% of goal)

Achievability: Systems like TriMet’s WES commuter rail and DART’s light rail demonstrate that achieving
or exceeding the 96% on-time performance target for commuter and light rail services is feasible with
proper maintenance and operational strategies.
Benchmarking: Many systems, such as Phoenix’s Valley Metro light rail, consistently approach or exceed
the proposed 83% and 96% targets, providing a practical benchmark for other transit agencies.
Incentives for Improvement: Cities like Seattle and San Diego, where on-time performance currently falls
below targets, highlight the need for focused improvements. Setting ambitious yet realistic goals ensures
these agencies prioritize investments and operational enhancements.
Public Confidence: Meeting or exceeding these targets is critical for maintaining public trust and increasing
ridership, as seen in San Diego’s significant ridership growth despite challenges in meeting OTP targets.

To achieve total vehicle boardings of 69,562,000 during the period from October 1, 2024 and ending

Combined boardings on RTD’s system in May, April, and October of 2024 were 17,349,000 boardings1. These were
the most recent three months with available data that did not include a major maintenance project suppressing
boardings. A baseline calculated from recent performance is the best approach for purposes of evaluating
performance improvement, as it reflects growth that was achieved during 2024, and which therefore should be
expected to be repeated in the subsequent performance period. Annualized, and adjusting for 2019 seasonal trends2,
maintaining ridership at the level achieved during those three months would result in 66,307,000 boardings3.

The achievement target is based on growing boardings above this annualized number by 5%. Five percent (5%) is
an achievable target, based on the expectation that the agency should be able to drive increased boardings from 1)
restoration of service frequency on many routes 2) additional service offered on some new routes and 3) it would
represent a post-COVID recovery to 65.8% of pre-COVID (2019) ridership, still below the recovery achieved by the

While it is a common practice in organizations to base employee performance assessments on a combination of
objective and subjective measures of performance, for CEOs, basing emphasizing objective performance goals is the
best approach.

AR

Y

28

Intuitively, the reason for this is simple - few top executives are selected for CEO roles without having shown
experience and leadership characteristics that demonstrate their ability to perform the basic responsibilities required
of the job. Despite this, not every CEO is able to achieve the quantitative goals that are set by stakeholders and
which are necessary for the organization to be sustainable over time. For RTD, the proposed 2025 goals are all
quantitatively measured, and are among the most important measurements for determining whether the organization
is effectively serving the public that pays, largely indirectly, for its existence.

FR

O

M

JA

NU

Academic research into the subject shows that the best performing CEOs are those who have their incentive
compensation based entirely on quantitative criteria. In their study “Firm Performance Implications of Using
Qualitative Criteria in CEO Bonus Contracts” (Advances in Management Accounting, Vol 31, pp. 55-89, 2019,
https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3077142), Nancy Chun Feng and Ahmet C. Kurt report that
their analysis of data for S&P 500 companies reveals that employee productivity, asset productivity, capital
expenditures, and future stock returns are lower when the CEO’s bonus payment depends in part on qualitative
criteria. Other research demonstrates that in the case of CFOs, they report lower satisfaction with compensation
when
incentive
compensation
is
awarded
subjectively
(https://www.journalofaccountancy.com/issues/2013/sep/20138319.html). In line with this observation, other
academics have long argued that qualitative assessments in decision-making were irrelevant when one could make
a reasonable judgment based on quantitative criteria. His thesis has been proven to work in different settings, such
as graduate school admissions and financial analysis.
Recent past performance frameworks for the current GM/CEO have specified that Objective Goals be 50% of the
basis for her performance assessment. Since all of the Short-term Goals that have been proposed for this period
focus on important issues that have a basis for quantitative measurement of performance, returning to the 50%
weighting for Short-term goals would put RTD’s GM/CEO performance assessment better in line with best practices.

Motion/amendment: Move to amend the 2025 GM-CEO Short-term Goals to add the following goal:

AR
D

Without increasing per-rider fares over current levels, and excluding fares derived from para-transit services,
increase fare collections from October 1, 2024 to September 30th, 2025 by $5 million over total fares collected
in calendar year 2024 by reducing fare evasion.
Supporting information:

BO

Widespread fare evasion is a clear problem on RTD’s assets. The goal of increased fare collections without fare level
increases can and should be accomplished by increased efforts to address fare evasion. Reasons to reduce fare
evasion include:

5

,2

AR



28



Lax enforcement of laws like the requirement for most riders to pay a fare to use RTD suggests to customers
that RTD does not care about rider conduct. Enforcement of the basic responsibility for riders to pay fares is
an important demonstration that following the rules on RTD assets is expected and breaking these rules will
have consequences.
The future ability of RTD to better serve its community may depend on its securing additional funding from
taxation, or from state or local entities funded by taxation. Making the case to elected officials and the tax
paying public - many of whom do not use RTD or who largely do not represent those who do - is made more
difficult when RTD does not take care to collect the fares it is owed from the riders who are obligated to pay
for their rides.
Every rider’s fare may not be able to be checked on every ride, but by creating the expectation that it often
will be, many riders will simply pay their fare as a matter of course. Over time, fares from reducing fare
evasion should far exceed the 2025 goal, and can generate enough money to allow RTD to meaningfully
increase its services to the public.

Y



FR

O

M

JA

NU

Increasing collected fares by reducing fare evasion by $5 million would mean collecting fares on approximately 1.8
million trips over 12 months where they are not currently collected at the cheapest standard fare, or roughly 2.5%
of expected 2025 boardings. It equates to collecting fares on some 5,000 more of the roughly 180,000 boardings
each day. Personnel used to collect these fares will have the side benefit of increasing the visible presence of RTD
authorities on assets, improving perceptions of rider safety and security.

service performance KPIs for FY25. As such, this should be no surprise - and I do sincerely hope the BoD can
reach broad consensus on this important matter.
