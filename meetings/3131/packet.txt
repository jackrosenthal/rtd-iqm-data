October 1, 2020

I am looking forward to joining RTD on November 9, 2020 as the
General Manager/CEO.
As I prepare to transition into my role over the course of the next few
weeks, I want to ensure that you all are aware of my path forward.
Recognizing that 120 days will elapse quickly, I am enclosing my initial
120-day plan that will enable me to make my vision of “Engaging
communities to bridge gaps” a reality.
The enclosed illustrates the high-level strategies in phases coupled with
timelines and the tactics I will employ during the course of my initial 120
days.
I intend to engage with the Board to communicate my observations and
set priorities.
I look forward to working collaboratively with all of you.
See you November 9, 2020.
