#### 1. Proposed May 2017 Service Changes

RECOMMENDED ACTION

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors approve the May 2017 Service Change package as revised and summarized in Attachment A resulting in an annualized cost of approximately $221,300 and, further, to authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is impacted by these changes.

DISCUSSION

To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance, sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different classes of service have different expectations of performance.  We will continue adjusting services in response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. It is also our responsibility to identify services that are underperforming and recommend modifications, curtailment or cancellation of service as warranted. The proposals herein include a mix of service improvements, adjustments and reductions. Based upon current and past ridership performance a number of services will have minor service reductions. The Route 40-Colorado Boulevard will see the largest reduction during the peak period. The 41st-Fox and Pecos Junction Stations are proposed to open to provide access to the B-Line and consequentially, Routes 8 and 19 are proposed to be realigned to serve the new stations.  We will monitor customer response to the implementation of these service changes and propose adjustments and service alternatives as appropriate in future service change recommendations.

The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:

- Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;

- The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;

- The availability of alternative services to affected riders;

- Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to enhance service when possible;

- Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and

- Response to changes in the communities where services are provided

SUMMARY OF PUBLIC HEARINGS

Five public hearings were conducted in Arvada, Denver (3) and Westminster between February 14th and February 27th. Comments and further details from these meetings and the service change website are summarized in Attachment B of this report.

CHANGES TO INITIAL RECOMMENDATION

Staff receives input during the public comment process and continues to conduct additional analysis after the initial service recommendations are communicated to the Board of Directors. Depending on the outcome of the public comment process and continued analysis, staff may or may not propose modifications to these initial recommendations. The following proposals have been significantly modified:

A Line: schedule adjustment to improve on-time performance and transit connections

R Line: schedule adjustments to improve on-time performance and reduce service delay

Route L – Longmont/Denver: schedule adjustments due to interline changes with route BOLT/BOLT Ltd

FINANCIAL IMPACT

The overall financial impact contained in this proposal includes a net base system cost increase of $221,300.

EQUITY ANALYSIS

The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Executive Order 12898 regarding Environmental Justice. In this circular, the FTA requires RTD to evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that exceed the established major service change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a disproportionately negative impact on minority or low-income populations. Our evaluation of the proposed May 2017 service changes does not reveal any disparities in impacts absorbed by minority or low-income populations.

A Look Ahead – August 2017

L – Line

As previously discussed with the Board, a proposed solution to D Line on-time performance issues and consequentially, overall light rail system performance, this concept introduces a modification to current D Line operations. The L Line adds a new 30th& Downing to 14th Street Loop (Downtown) movement, replacing the D Line service between 30th & Downing Station and 19th Street. More extensive information regarding this proposal will be made available in a future update to the Board of Directors.
