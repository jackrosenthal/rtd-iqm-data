BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

From:

Heather
Copp,

Date:

October 13, 2016

Subject:

Transfer FasTracks Sales and Use Tax
Revenues in Excess of Forecasted Sales and
Use Tax Revenues to FasTracks Internal
Savings Account

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: October 13, 2016
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: October 25, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors approve transferring FasTracks sales and use tax revenues (.4%) from unrestricted fund
balance to the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) on an annual basis when actual sales and
use tax revenues (.4%) collected for the calendar year exceed the forecasted sales and use tax
revenues (.4%) projected in the adopted budget each year. The actual sales and use tax revenues
will be determined based on the audited financial statements.
BACKGROUND
During the course of preparing and adopting the Annual Program Evaluation (APE) and Financial Plan,
many meetings with the Board of Directors and stakeholders were held regarding the lack of funds
and use of the FISA to assist in funding shortfalls in FasTracks. Use of the FISA to cover shortfalls
in operations and maintenance was not popular with many of the Board members and stakeholders,
but staff felt it was a necessity due to current revenue forecasts.
DISCUSSION
During meetings with some of the stakeholders, it was suggested that if FasTracks revenue
forecasts improved in the future those excess funds could be directed towards the FISA. Some
stakeholders felt this could evidence continued RTD support for construction of the unfunded
corridors. This action would transfer, on an annual basis, FasTracks sales and use tax revenue in
excess of the forecasted FasTracks sales and use tax revenue to the FISA account. This would only
occur if there was actual revenue collected above the forecast.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
This should not have a fiscal impact as any FasTracks sales and use tax actual collections over the
yearly forecasted projections would already be deposited and be used towards the FasTracks program
generally. This action would direct those revenues to the FISA account instead of the unrestricted fund
balance.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. FasTracks sales and use tax revenues in excess of
forecasted revenue will be annually transferred to the FISA account.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Revenues in excess of forecasted revenue will be
retained in the unrestricted fund balance but can still be specifically transferred to the FISA

1.C.1.a

Integrity of Model Forecasts
Forecasts are updated semi-annually to reflect the most current
economic situation.
Forecasts may be too high or too low, reflecting uncertainty in the
economy.
Forecasts are generated from theoretically sound economic relations,
modeled with state-of-the-art methods of modern econometric time
series analysis.
BRD forecasts do not incorporate “add factors” or other subjective
adjustments of model forecasts.
BRD is independent from RTD with no political or financial stake in the
forecast numbers.

Information

The Smart Card Program continues to gather taps for EcoPass (business and neighborhood) and
CollegePass riders since the program’s launch on January 2, 2013. There are approximately 475,000
active cards in circulation. During the month of September, 2016, 1.60M taps were recorded.
The Stored Value MyRide Card is a product that can be purchased by the general public currently
enrolled in the public pilot program to pay for transit fares on fixed route buses and rail platforms. Stored
Value is provided on reloadable plastic cards. These cards can be loaded with certain dollar amounts and
used much like a gift card. Once the card is loaded, it can be used to board bus or rail until the dollar
amount on the card is less than the fare needed. Additional value can be loaded onto the card at RTD
sales outlets.
Starting the morning of Monday January 4th, cards were being dispersed to the public pilot program
participants at the RTD retail outlets. As of October 2, 2016, a total of 1,920 cards were issued of
which 1,520 (79%) were full fare and 400 (21%) were discount cards. The average initial stored value
loading is $40.99 with a total value loaded including reloads of $275,100. There have been 96,070
boardings using these MyRide cards with fare payment value of $211,600. Of these boardings; 70%
were local, 28% regional and 2% airport.
All bus installations were completed for operational service. Additional validators will be installed as
buses are purchased.
Additional platform validators were installed for the University of Colorado A Line and B line to
Westminster. More platform validators will be installed on the G Line to Wheat Ridge and the R line to
Aurora. All 191 Light and Commuter Rail platform validators have been installed and are operational.

Subject:

Fiscal Sustainability Update

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: October 13, 2016
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: October 18, 2016

BACKGROUND
A Fiscal Sustainability Task Force (Task Force) was formed in November 2010 for the purpose of making
recommendations detailing opportunities for operating efficiencies and revenue enhancement for the
Base System to ensure RTD’s long-term fiscal sustainability. The Task Force consisted of 22 members
with 12 of those members being external to RTD.
The Task Force presented its written
recommendations to the Board of Directors in June 2011. The Board of Directors subsequently
approved those recommendations and directed Staff to pursue implementation of each recommendation.
The Task Force reconvened for a final meeting in July 2012 to be briefed on the progress of their
recommendations and provide an opportunity for feedback.
DISCUSSION
The Task Force made revenue enhancement, expense reduction and fiscal policy recommendations to
the Board of Directors which were approved for further consideration and/or implementation. The
majority of the recommendations made have been completed or their status has not changed since our
last report in March 2016. Per Board policy, we continue to report on the status of the Task Force
recommendations as follows:
Recommendations - Completed
Removing the Volatility from Sales and Use Tax Projections
RTD contracted with the University of Colorado, Leeds School of Business – Business Research Division
(Leeds) to provide sales and use tax forecasts beginning in 2011. Each quarter, Leeds has provided a
forecast containing short-term (one year by quarter), medium-term (six year SBP period) and long-term
(30 year APE period) sales and use tax projections. This was implemented to provide RTD with expert
economic analysis and sales and use tax forecasts using sophisticated financial modeling techniques not
available internally. These forecasts are intended to provide a better analysis of RTD’s expected sales
and use tax collections which comprise approximately 2/3 of RTD’s recurring revenues. The CU
contract was renewed for semi-annual forecasts rather than quarterly beginning in 2016.
Service Optimization
In 2012, RTD implemented modifications and reductions in service representing approximately $10.7
million or an 8% net reduction in service. Service optimization was recommended by the Task Force and
implemented with Board approval in order to match services provided with available funding sources.
Since that time, service has been gradually restored as needed within budgetary constraints. Service
modifications were brought forward to accommodate the new FasTracks lines opening in 2016 and we
will continue to assess service optimization.
Fund Balance Policy

Packet Pg. 49

1.C.4

Due to the volatility of RTD’s largest single revenue source, sales and use taxes, the Task Force
recommended implementation of a more robust fiscal policy regarding fund balances. Fund balances
represent financial assets that are available to RTD after allowing for obligations that have been incurred.
Fund balances increase when fund sources exceed fund uses and vice versa. Fund balances, therefore,
exist as a form of savings account to be used for specific purposes when needed and replenished when
economic circumstances allow. In response to this recommendation, RTD implemented a fund balance
policy with a target level of three months of operating expenses for the Base System, which is now
approximately $100 million. The target fund balance for FasTracks has been two months of operating
expenses (with the third month contributed to FISA), but this will change to three months of operating
expenses beginning in 2017 (per the APE).
These targets were established based on levels
recommended by the Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA) best practices. The Fund
Balance Policy further categorizes the available fund balances into the categories of a Board Restricted
Fund and a Capital Replacement Fund. At 8/31/16, these fund balances prior to adjustments totaled
$53.7 million for both the Base system and FasTracks combined.
Sales and Use Tax Exemptions
In Colorado, legislation establishes products and services that are subject to sales and use taxation and
those that are exempt from taxation. The state, cities, municipalities and special districts in Colorado
each have different sales and use tax rates and often have differing items subject to taxation due to
legislation establishing exemptions. Exemption parity was identified by the Task Force as providing a
benefit to RTD during difficult economic conditions when the state implements exemption changes and
vice versa. In addition, exemption parity removes the complexity to vendors of RTD having different
taxable items than the state. RTD introduced legislation that was passed in May 2013 to establish
parity with the state regarding items subject to sales and use taxation. Exemption parity took effect
1/1/14. RTD estimates that parity generated a net increase of $2.7 million in 2014 based on 2012
figures, however, this is difficult to track due to the way vendors report sales tax components. This
change in legislation has been challenged and a Petition for Writ of Certiorari has been filed with the
Colorado Supreme Court.
Technology and Energy Innovation
RTD conducted a comprehensive energy audit of the oldest and largest operating division (the Platte
facility) to determine the potential scope of savings that may be available through equipment and lighting
upgrades. The audit identified that facility lighting upgrades could result in potentially significant energy
savings. Areas for minor energy savings were identified for other building systems; however, these have
a very significant capital investment and long pay-back periods. Approximately two years ago, Facilities
Maintenance completed lighting upgrades by replacing older metal-halide fixtures with more energyefficient fluorescent fixtures at the East Metro, Boulder, District Shops and Platte operating facilities.
Solar panels were also installed at the East Metro facility. Average savings of approximately $50,000
annually have occurred at the East Metro facility due to the combination of lighting and solar upgrades.
The Boulder facility is remaining even in costs since the lighting upgrades occurred. District Shops is
saving $20,000 annually and the Platte Division is saving over $50,000 annually. RTD budgets for
energy upgrades throughout the District in the Strategic Budget Plan. We will continue to address
energy efficiency in building systems as on-going projects are completed.
Sales and Use Tax Compliance Reviews
The Colorado Department of Revenue (DOR) collects and audits sales and use taxes for RTD. The Task
Force identified an opportunity for revenue enhancement by performing additional sales and use tax
compliance reviews based on the favorable collection experiences of Colorado cities and municipalities
that implemented these reviews. Compliance reviews consist of RTD providing additional resources
from a contracted provider to supplement the DOR’s audit function and is intended to provide the DOR

Packet Pg. 50

1.C.4

with the additional resources necessary to ensure complete and timely tax compliance by vendors. RTD
contracted with Revenue Recovery Group (RRG), an audit firm with substantial experience providing
compliance review services to several Colorado municipalities, and the program began in April 2014.
While assessments from this effort exceeded the costs, it was not clear to what extent those
assessments would be collected. RTD staff decided not to extend RRG’s contract beyond 12/31/15 due
to the limited remaining opportunities for assessments outside of the scope of work of the DOR.
Recommendations – Ongoing
Naming Rights
In August, the RTD Board approved the first naming rights/corporate sponsorship agreement under the
Board-adopted naming rights policy with the University of Colorado for naming the commuter rail A Line
and creating an advertising presence on the Flatiron Flyer bus rapid transit line. In return, RTD will
receive from the University of Colorado total gross payments of $5 million over five years, less
implementation costs and commission, with a possible five year extension if both parties agree. By way
of background, RTD’s naming rights consultant WME/IMG presented to the Board in 2013 an inventory
and financial analysis of RTD facilities, services, and assets that could lend themselves to
naming/sponsorship value-added contracts. WME/IMG completed the valuation of RTD assets and was
given the green light to begin pursuing potential clients, resulting in the public launch of the program in
the third quarter of 2014. Any additional proposed naming rights/corporate sponsorship contracts will
continue to be brought to the RTD Board for approval.
Partnerships and Privatization
The Task Force described this recommendation as a broad area that could include items such as
privatizing routes and administrative and operational functions to reduce expenses. RTD undertook
some actions under this recommendation such as the lease of the DUS historic building, IGAs for
improvements to US36 and the East Line, as well as TOD activities. RTD continues to look for
partnership and privatization opportunities on an ongoing basis. RTD has received an unsolicited
proposal regarding its parking facilities that may present further opportunities for working with the
private sector.
Recommendations – Low Priority
The status of recommendations made by the Task Force and categorized at the 2012 Board Retreat as
having lower priority follows:
Charge for Parking
RTD currently charges parking fees to out-of-District patrons, in-District patrons that park longer than 24
hours, and for reserved parking. In 2013, the state legislature, allowed daily parking fees only at nonDistrict facilities. In July 2016, RTD staff presented a parking management briefing at a study session
that focused on a consultant pay-for-parking study, parking management program update, and
FasTracks partnering projects. Since the inception of the parking management program, $218,659 has
been contributed to the general fund.
Tolling and Managed Lanes
The Task Force recommended investigating the possibility of RTD generating additional revenues
through charges for tolling and managed lanes.
Enacting this recommendation would require
coordination with CDOT and other agencies. The US36 BRT project is an example of how tolling and
managed lanes can enhance RTD operations and save costs. The agreement guarantees running times,
allows for bus on shoulder operations to facilitate schedule adherence on local service, and provides for

Packet Pg. 51

1.C.4

maintenance of managed lanes with no contribution from RTD. Prior to entering into agreements with
CDOT for managed lanes, RTD contributed to maintenance and snow removal on the I-25 HOV lanes.
Home Rule Initiative
The Task Force recommended that RTD consider becoming a “Home Rule” entity which would allow
RTD to collect and audit its sales and use taxes instead of the DOR. This initiative would require
legislation. RTD met several times with the DOR to discuss this initiative as well as sales and use tax
compliance reviews. Although the DOR did not object to RTD performing these services itself, the
Colorado Municipal League and other entities recommended against it. “Home Rule” is a state
constitutional authorization for creating municipalities. It could only be secured for RTD by statewide
constitutional amendment. As discussed earlier in this report, RTD has effected simplification of state
and RTD taxation through legislation that provides for uniformity on items taxed.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

From:

Heather
Copp,
Administration

Date:

October 13, 2016

Subject:

2017 Requested Budget Update

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: October 13, 2016
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: October 18, 2016

BACKGROUND
The State of Colorado requires that a requested budget be presented to the Board and be made
available for public inspection after giving public notice in newspapers of major distribution by
October 15th of each year. RTD’s 2017 Requested Budget was presented at the Financial
Administration and Audit Committee on September 20, 2016. Public notice was given in the
October 8-9, 2016 weekend editions of The Denver Post and The Boulder Daily Camera. Copies of
the 2017 Requested Budget were made available at that time in the Board office for public
inspection.
The purpose of this Board report is to update the Board with proposed changes and new information
that has become available since the presentation of the 2017 Requested Budget at the FAAC. The
2017 Recommended Budget (final budget) will then be presented at the November 15th Financial
Administration and Audit Committee meeting with a request to forward the budget to the Board for
adoption on November 22nd.
DISCUSSION
The attached power point presentation summarizes the revised assumptions incorporated into the
2017 Requested Budget and the resulting changes from the first draft of the 2017 Requested Budget
previously presented at the FAAC. Major revisions and areas of focus follow:


Sales/use taxes are revised from the first draft Requested Budget previously presented.
The first draft budget incorporated the CU-Leeds School March forecast and the subject
update incorporates the same. The Recommended Budget will be revised further for the
September sales/use tax forecast. In this 2017 budget update, sales/use tax is budgeted
to increase 5.6% over the 2016 projection used in the 2016 Amended Budget.



Total District-wide operating expenses (excluding depreciation) of $594.5 million are
$13.4 million lower than compared to the first draft Requested Budget. This bulk of this
difference is attributed to the reclassification of the TABOR interest portion of DTO service
payment from FT Operations to FT Project. Interest expense is not included in operating
expenses and is shown as a separate line item. Also, further operating expense reductions
were made by all departments to meet the operating expense target established in the
SBP. These reductions were offset by certain necessary increases to operating expense
items.



The District-wide Appropriation of $1,251.8 million is $35.2 million higher than the first
draft Requested Budget. This increase is due to a higher estimate for FT interest expense
to include the TABOR portion in 2017, a higher estimate for the DTO service payment due
to inflation adjustment, increase to FT fund balance requirement, health insurance
increases for salaried personnel, inclusion of costs for material salvage, wages and salary

Packet Pg. 53

1.C.5

adjustments, an increase in LRV spare parts, and other miscellaneous increases to the
overall budget, offset by expense reductions made to departments budgets to bring them
in line with target amounts, and certain capital project amounts shifted from 2017 to
2016.


A possible fuel lock for 2017 will have positive benefit. Diesel fuel is budgeted at
$1.80/gallon for 2017, down from the 2016 per gallon lock price of $2.23. The favorable
impact from the 2016 price is approximately $4.3 million. The futures price is currently
around $1.78 and we will monitor for lock opportunities to provide budget certainty.



Gasoline remains budgeted at $2.65/gallon, down from the 2016 per gallon budget price
of $3.00. The favorable impact year-over-year is approximately $0.6 million.



The total capital carryforward (previously approved capital) is not estimated at this time
but will be included in the Recommended Budget.



The estimated 2017 service availability payment to DTO is $77.1 million adjusted for
inflation and consists of a service payment and interest payment. The service payment of
$36.1M is carried in FT Operations and the TABOR interest payment of $41.0 million is
carried in FT Project.



In FT Project and FT Operations, the Board-Appropriated fund, Capital Replacement fund,
and Unrestricted fund are established at 3 months of operating expenses, up from 2
months previously, per the APE.



The Base System unrestricted fund balance is budgeted at $2 million, which is the fund
balance target in the SBP. The SBP target remains viable after adjusting for the abovenoted expense items and items with favorable impact also noted above.

The 2017 Requested Budget and Fund Balance Report showing the operating and capital sources and
expenditures of the District for the Base System and FT are included as Exhibit I. The following
tables are a summary of the attached Exhibit I. The 2017 Requested Budget column below includes
the revisions noted above (in thousands).
