#### 1. Transit Oriented Communities (TOC) Update

Bill Sirois, Senior Manager for Transit Oriented Communities (TOC), reviewed the TOC Update presentation included in the Planning and Development meeting agenda packet for March 3, 2015.  The presentation included updates on the Civic Center Transit District Plan, Title VI Equity Analyses, First and Final Mile to Transit, the University of Denver Garage Retail, the Welton Corridor Pilot, Transit Oriented Development (TOD) Functional Assessment, Real Property Unsolicited Proposal Policy, Value Capture, Alameda Pilot Station, Olde Town Pilot, Federal Center Pilot, Depot Square, and Station Area Master Plans.

Bill Sirois noted that the department’s name has been officially changed from TOD to TOC.  He mentioned that he was not planning on going into details for the Alameda Pilot Station, Olde Town Pilot, Federal Center Pilot, Depot Square, and Station Area Master Plans but would be happy to answer any questions on those.

Committee Chair James expressed his appreciation for the work on the TOD assessment.

Director Folska thanked Bill Sirois for the comprehensive review.  She asked Bill Sirois to read the complete slide on Value Review as well as the slides on the Alameda Pilot Station, Old Towne Pilot, Federal Center Pilot, Depot Square, and Station Area Master Plans.  Bill Sirois read the requested slides.  Director Folska thanked Bill Sirois for reading the slides.

Director Folska expressed her confusion about unsolicited proposals versus sole source.  Bill Sirois explained that RTD’s current unsolicited proposal policy excludes real property.  He noted that the policy that is being worked on will address when sole source opportunity would be appropriate for real estate.

Director Francone asked how unsolicited proposals are currently handled.  Bill Sirois said that they are handled on a case by case basis following Resolution #10 from 1984.  Committee Chair James added that the pilot program started about a year ago is examining different methodologies for real property disposition.  Bill Sirois mentioned that Susan Altes, Senior Manager for Property will have a report in the near future.  This report will take lessons learned into account.

Director Lubow noted that it seemed logical to wait for input from the TOD Assessment consultant to finalize the unsolicited proposal policy.  Bill Sirois stated that that is staff’s plan.  He hopes to have an update for the Board in May.

Director Walker mentioned that he has read a lot about density criticism; however, those projects are not at large transfer centers like Alameda and Broadway.  He asked Bill Sirois if he has seen any resistance to TOC projects.  Bill Sirois replied that the City and County of Denver has embraced TOCs.  Jurisdictions outside of Denver vary on their support.  He said that most communities have been accepting during the planning process.  It is when the specifics of how many potential people will live in a certain area is addressed that people get a bit upset.

Director Bagley noted that he toured Depot Square with Chair Sisk last week.  He did so in order to understand some of the challenges he has read in the Denver Post regarding density and height.  He said that he was very impressed with the progress at it is at 95% complete.  The property is centrally located.  He mentioned that all buildings in the area are at a 5 story level.  He encouraged the Directors to go visit soon as the location opens in about 3 months.  Committee Chair James thanked Director Bagley for illustrating the catalyst RTD is to development in the Metro area.  Committee Chair James mentioned that some areas are perceived to be too dense (like Cherry Creek and 32nd and Lowell).  These areas, he said, need to be examined on a case by case basis.

Director Menten asked how far $150,000 - $250,000 would go on the University Garage project.  Bill Sirois said that his team is having this conversation with the Financial Department.  Director Menten asked if there would be an update for the Board prior to the release of the Request for Proposal (RFP).  Bill Sirois said that yes, an update will be given.

Director Menten asked about the RFP process in 2012 and 2014.  Bill Sirois clarified that no RFP was issued after 2012.  After the 2012 RFP, his department engaged other commercial real estate experts to get a better handle on the property and qualities of the RFP.  Director Menten wondered if his department would be able to give a better idea of what RTD would get for the investment during the April meeting.  Bill Sirois replied that his team can only guess an estimate until we start getting proposals.  He noted that an initial investment of $500,000 - $700,000 would return about 3 times over a 7 year period.

Director Menten recalled that the space at the University garage seemed to be tight causing her to have a hard time picturing where there is room for new parking spaces.  She mentioned that old minutes point out there was a plan for diagonal parking but the City and County of Denver had an opinion on that idea.  Bill Sirois explained that the first level ramp has space for 25-26 head in parking spaces.  There will also be loading zone space for retail.  Regarding angled parking, Bill Sirois noted that it was a proposal for the street parking but the City and County of Denver has the final decision as they own the right of way.  They did not support angled parking.

Director Menten wondered if the business utilizing the retail space would have a say on what RTD is doing inside the garage.  Bill Sirois said that retailers will have requirements into what goes into the retail space but not the garage.  Director Menten asked for an update at the April meeting.  Bill Sirois replied that he will provide any updates available at the time.

Chair Sisk thanked Director Bagley for his visit to Depot Square and showing a regional approach.  Chair Sisk said that Director Menten asked some of the questions he had as well.  He wondered if the formal name of the parking garage is the University garage.  Bill Sirois said that the light rail station’s name is University of Denver, so the parking is using that name as well.  Chair Sisk expressed his concern that some students are using the parking lot as if it were property of the University of Denver.  He encouraged staff to have a much wider discussion and plan that would make sense for retail, commuters, and enforcement issues.  He reminded staff and the Directors that commuters that used that Park-n-Ride have come to Board meetings to express their concern.  Chair Sisk said that RTD owes it to its constituents to make a full review of that area and looks forward to seeing a full scale analysis.

Director Menten asked Bill Sirois to review the three options being proposed by the City and County of Denver and RTD for the Welton property.  Bill Sirois said that the three options were affordable housing opportunities, for sale housing, and retail to support community goals.  Director Menten said that even though the property is in the middle of Downtown, she would prefer to see higher paying jobs in the area, such as manufacturing or hospital equipment.  She said that higher wages mean more money for the community and retail wages are not going to provide for a family.  Bill Sirois said that the property is 18,000 square feet and would be more suitable to an office component on the ground floor and residential projects above.  He said that the area is also in historic preservation.  He noted that he could speak to the City and County of Denver about other options even when those options are not consistent with the current plan.  Director Menten said that she would like to continue the conversation offline.

Committee Chair James thanked both Bill Sirois and Bill Van Meter for the compilation of articles on the increase of value around light rail stations.  He said this puts the role of the TOC Department into perspective.  He mentioned RTD’s role is to move people and the TOC Department has the opportunity to increase the liveability of a community.  He pointed out that this is consistent with RTD’s mission statement.

Director Folska asked Bill Sirois if he had heard of Galvanize Denver.  Bill Sirois said that he had.  She noted that RTD could perhaps create those kinds of opportunities (education, community focus, and venture capital) for smaller business areas.

Director Anderson noted that it is great that RTD can work with communities to add value.  She reminded the Board that the cities and counties are the ones that are land use planners.  They have comprehensive plans.  It is great that RTD can cooperate with the municipalities as long as RTD remembers its role in the process.

General Manager Phil Washington said that RTD is in a very unique position in the Denver Metro region as we are transforming the region through transit infrastructure investment.  He said that as APTA Chair he has been talking about gentrification around the country.  He noted that we celebrate TOC but we also have to be aware that this has been pushing the transit dependent out of the urban core.  Many of the TOC projects do not include affordable housing.  Removing the transit dependent from the employment core is forcing us to provide transit outside the of the transit core.  The transit dependent have come to meetings saying that they cannot afford to pay the fares.  RTD has been extending services in order to provide transit to the displaced which increases RTD’s costs.   Phil Washington said that he was mentioning this to the Directors as food for thought.  Committee Chair James added that RTD is an important part of society but not all of it.
