There was one request to modify the minutes which was from Director Lewis. He

Committee be modified to indicate that he raised the issue of the sunsetting of the
Greyhound Lease at Union Station during other matters.

Chair Davidson declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

XVI. Chair's Report
Presented by Chair Davidson.

XVII. Unanimous Consent
Chair Davidson noted that Director Lewis had requested that Item B, 2025 Fiscal Policy be
removed from Unanimous Consent and be placed in Recommended Action.
During the Operations, Safety, and Security Committee meeting held on Wednesday,
October 9th, several Directors correctly noted that the Public Transportation Agency Safety
Plan, or PTASP and related attachments included in the packet contained apparent
typographical errors, such as names of individuals no longer employed with RTD as well as
incomplete phone numbers for certain individuals.
Please note that the documents included in tonight’s agenda packet are the same as those
approved in committee on October 9th, and further explanation is warranted.

Page 5 of 11
Packet Pg. 11

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Oct 22, 2024 5:30 PM (Approval of Board Meeting Minutes and Committee Reports)

Presented by Committee Chair Catlin.

Several of these apparent errors were in fact intentional redactions, that is, certain phone
numbers included in the exhibits are for personal devices and have been redacted prior to
the publication of the agenda packet. Similarly, the names of certain individuals who are
no longer employed with RTD are referenced in policies and procedures approved and
compiled over the course of the past year since the previous iteration of the PTASP was
submitted to the Colorado Public Utilities Commission, or CPUC. Additionally, the PTASP’s
exhibits, such as the organizational chart and the listing of emergency contacts, are
evergreen and subject to revision over time as necessary; this means that contacts, phone
numbers, org charts and other materials on file with the CPUC are periodically revised as
necessary to reflect current information.
In closing, the PTASP document and the corresponding exhibits that will be submitted to
the CPUC prior to November 1st will be the full, unredacted versions and will include the
most current versions of policies, procedures, reference materials and contacts available at
that time.
Director Lewis requested Item A, 2025 Investment Policy be removed from Unanimous
Consent and be placed in Recommended Action.
Director Tisdale requested item C, 2025 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan
(PTASP) be removed from the Unanimous Consent and be placed in Recommended Action.
Chair Davidson noted after these changes were made there were no items listed under
Unanimous Consent.

2024. The FYFF informs the development and consideration of approval of the Budget.

Appendix

In January, RTD implemented a simpler, more
equitable, and more affordable fare structure.
Customers now pay less for fares in all categories,
including eligible discounts.

On behalf of the agency, I truly appreciate the
opportunity to lead this team of dedicated individuals as
we strive to be the trusted leader in mobility, delivering
excellence and value to our customers and community.

In 2024, RTD celebrated many successes and first-time
accomplishments for the agency. While the list of
achievements is long, I would be remiss if I did not
specifically highlight a few that have made the lives of
RTD’s employees and customers better.

Analysis

Through the efforts of RTD’s Finance team, agency
executives, senior managers, and subject-matter experts,
these four initiatives are reflected throughout this budget
and interwoven into work plans across all departments
and divisions. By focusing on these important factors,
RTD will continue to make meaningful progress toward its
established success outcomes. RTD also continues to
adapt to the ever-evolving transit needs of customers and
communities throughout the service area.

I also extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to the
many employees who directly contributed to the
preparation of RTD’s FY 2025 Budget. I specifically want
to acknowledge Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer;
Todd Nikkel, Senior Manager, Budget; Heidi Wagner,
Senior Manager, Finance; the agency’s Budget Analysts;
Stuart Summers, Chief Communications and Engagement
Officer, for compiling this document; and members of
RTD’s Leadership Team. And lastly, I would be remiss not
to thank the customers, communities, stakeholders, and
partners who engage with RTD.

Of course, none of these accomplishments—and many
more—would be possible without the efforts of the
agency’s steadfast and committed employees who work
tirelessly every day. I acknowledge and appreciate their
collaborative efforts, as well as the contributions of the
Board of Directors and the agency’s labor and contract
partners.

Executive
Summary

The Fiscal Year 2025 Budget represents the agency’s
financial plan for the forthcoming year. This budget aligns
with the agency’s 2021-2026 Strategic Plan, which
outlines an ongoing commitment to the Strategic Priorities
of Community Value, Customer Excellence, Employee
Ownership, and Financial Success. With this commitment
also comes a continued emphasis on the strategic
initiatives of Back to Basics, People Power, Welcoming
Transit Environment, and the newly introduced initiative
of Customer and Community Connections.

Between May and August, RTD completed the first
phase of its Downtown Rail Reconstruction Project.
The project reconstructed 30-year-old rail
infrastructure along the agency’s original light rail
alignment. Crews completed weeks ahead of schedule,
and subsequent phases of the project are slated for
2025.
• In September, RTD’s one-year Zero Fare for Youth
pilot program became permanent for customers 19
and under. The Colorado legislature appropriated
funding through December 2025 to support the zerofare youth program.
• Over the last year, RTD made significant progress on
its comprehensive Facilities and Fleet Transition Plan.
The plan is assessing the agency’s operations to
determine a path forward for lowering emissions. The
plan is on track to be completed by mid-December
2024.
•

Attachment: FY2025_Budget_2024-11-11_SMALL [Revision 1] (5023 : 2025 Proposed Budget)

good repair, enhanced employee recruitment and
retention initiatives, and made significant progress in
creating a welcoming transit environment.

RTD also made major progress on its Facilities and Fleet
Transition Plan (FFTP), which is a framework and
technical vision to guide the agency in its transition to
alternative fuels. This plan will be completed in midDecember 2024, and a final report and presentation will
be shared with the Board.

RTD also completed a Northwest Rail Peak Service
Feasibility Study. This months-long study updated
assumptions and costs regarding completion of the
unfinished FasTracks Northwest Rail corridor which would
provide rail service from downtown Denver through
Boulder to Longmont. The results of that study were
presented to the Board on September 18, 2024.

Financial
Analysis

P

In January 2024, RTD implemented Board-approved
recommendations resulting from an 18-month fare study
and equity analysis. This new fare structure simplified
and lowered fares while also addressing any equity
concerns. The changes followed a comprehensive
analysis, which included significant public outreach and
engagement efforts. The financial impacts of lowering
fares were relatively modest, and community acceptance
and feedback has been overwhelmingly positive.

RTD’s People Power initiative experienced improved
hiring and retention, particularly with frontline staff and
an expansion of the Transit Police division. Through June
2024, RTD’s active employee counts rose to 3,457 as
compared to 2,943 in June 2023, with increases primarily
in bus and rail operators. Historically, these job
categories have been chronically understaffed. The June
2024 vacancy rate for budgeted positions stood at 15%.
These staffing improvements have resulted from
expanded ongoing hiring and recruitment activities as
well as certain retention initiatives, including enhanced
training, onboarding, mentorship programs, and certain
total rewards improvements.

RTD continues to expand its Transit Police force in
support of the Welcoming Transit Environment initiative
while also implementing certain measures in support of
crime prevention through environmental design (CPTED).
Expansion of the Transit Police function has provided
additional security assurances to customers and
operators, and devoted certain resources towards
addressing societal issues such as homeless outreach
personnel. This initiative will continue and is being
coordinated with several local jurisdictions throughout
the Denver metro area.

Executive
Summary

During 2024, RTD has continued to implement its System
Optimization Plan (SOP), which is the agency’s branded
Comprehensive Operational Analysis (COA). This
implementation follows the COVID-19 pandemic and a
renewed focus on the agency’s operations and
maintenance activities, after having previously completed
several multi-year FasTracks transit expansion projects.

RTD also implemented several improvements during
2024 related to its Back to Basics initiative, such as the
COA, improved financial planning activities, and a focus
on maintaining a state of good repair for the agency’s
$9.3 billion of assets. During 2024, RTD began a year’s
long infrastructure reconstruction and repair effort to
maintain several light rail elements that have now
reached 30 years of revenue service. These ongoing
efforts align with RTD’s Transit Asset Management (TAM)
Plan (see Appendix) with a focus on providing continual
transit services while maintaining taxpayer’s investments.

Attachment: FY2025_Budget_2024-11-11_SMALL [Revision 1] (5023 : 2025 Proposed Budget)

Fiscal year 2024 primarily focused the agency’s
expenditures on providing core business services to
customers while, at the same time, enacting certain
Strategic Plan Initiatives of People Power, Back to Basics,
and providing a Welcoming Transit Environment.

In addition, RTD continues to meet the Board-approved
fiscal policy requirements for maintenance of adequate
reserves and debt coverage ratios. The agency’s senior
bond credit ratings were also raised by S&P Global during
2024 to the highest rating of AAA. RTD continues to
cash-fund all purchases without the need to borrow
funding and continues to reduce its debt portfolio
exposure through refinancings and the efficient use of its
financial resources.

Executive
Summary

A Revenue Diversification Working Group was convened
in early 2024 that sought to reduce RTD’s financial
exposure and risk using concentrated revenue funding
sources. Board-approved recommendations from this
Working Group included enhancements to RTD’s
recommended 2025 Fiscal Policy.

Attachment: FY2025_Budget_2024-11-11_SMALL [Revision 1] (5023 : 2025 Proposed Budget)

Financially, RTD continues to perform well. In August,
the Colorado Office of the State Auditor (OSA) completed
a financial performance audit of RTD, which resulted in
the agency meeting all nine of the state’s financial health
measurements with no warning signs.

Light Rail Preventative Maintenance Work
In early June, RTD began implementing speed restrictions along isolated sections
of track until necessary preventative maintenance work is completed. Along the D,
E, H, and R lines, RTD’s Maintenance of Way (MOW) team has staged and
installed thousands of feet of new rail, welded rail joints, grinded surface defects,
and leveled track ballast. In 2024, RTD’s MOW team accomplished the largest
overnight rail installation in the agency’s history.

Enhanced Track Inspections
To ensure track infrastructure is maintained in a state of good repair, RTD
implemented an enhanced inspection process in May. The intent of the regularly
scheduled inspections is to proactively identify preventive maintenance needs,
avoid major infrastructure issues, and reduce the risk of hazards and system
failures. The thorough inspection process includes a visual, electrical, and
mechanical inspection of all components that affect safe and reliable operations,
as well as standards for implementing speed restrictions if deficiencies are noted.

Coping Panels Project
In August, RTD concluded its multi-year project to repair the caps of retaining
walls that run along I-25 between Denver and Lone Tree. All coping panels along
the Southeast Corridor, between I-25•Broadway Station and Lincoln Station, were
reinforced to provide additional strength and weather resistance. In 2024, RTD's
project contractor added extra work crews to expedite the repairs, resulting in its
completion approximately three weeks ahead of schedule.

RTD commenced a multi-phased, first-ever project in early June to reconstruct
light rail track in downtown Denver. The first phase of the full-depth
reconstruction project focused on five key intersections in Denver’s Downtown
Loop, which is part of the agency’s original light rail line that opened in 1994.
Phase one of the project was completed on August 29, 2024, approximately three
weeks ahead of schedule. Phases two through four of the approximately $152
million reconstruction project will resume in 2025.

Employee Recruitment and Retention
To more expediently fill open positions, RTD added a key recruitment positions in
both Bus Operations and Rail Operations. Additionally, the agency launched multifaceted paid marketing campaigns to generate interest and attract applicants. RTD
also hosted multiple career fairs for select high-need roles, such as bus operators.
These tactics have helped close the gap in open positions for departments and
enabled the agency more effectively deliver transit services in the community.

Service Changes Outreach and Feedback
Ahead of RTD’s September Service Changes, the agency overhauled its
communications and engagement approach and adopted a more robust outreach
strategy. The completely revised approach enhances communications to
customers and stakeholders, introduces new opportunities for in-person and
virtual feedback, leverages existing community events, directly connects with
customers at stops and stations, and explains the proposed changes in a more
straightforward manner.

Improved Asset Management
In June, teams involved in asset management began brainstorming best practices
aimed at improving the agency’s asset management program. An immediate need
to improve capital project prioritization was identified. Members of Finance and
Administration quickly developed a new scoring tool and process to prioritize the
many capital requests and ensure close alignment with RTD Strategic Priorities.
Developing and implementing this new tool allowed Finance to prioritize capital
requests for the 2025 budget cycle in a timely fashion.

Executive
Summary

Cyber Security Awareness
To reduce the likelihood of a costly mistake for the agency, RTD has spent much
of 2024 improving employee training on recognizing and flagging phishing
attempts. Improved training and enhanced detection and remediation tools has
helped RTD protect itself from the ever-increasing threat of cyber attacks that
could adversely impact daily operations.

opportunities for all employees. As part of the year-long calendar of events, RTD
celebrated all agency employees for Transit Employee Appreciation Day in March.
Additionally, RTD coordinated an agency-wide donation drive for National
Volunteer Month in April, and supported the Rail Rodeo, Snowplow Roadeo, and
Bus Roadeo. The 2024 Bus Roadeo was the largest competition in RTD’s history.

De-Escalation Training for Operators
The agency continued to improve its de-escalation training for operators by
incorporating RTD Transit Police input and participation. During the first quarter of
2024, operators received updated training that now includes presentations about
criminal liability, what constitutes criminal activity, and the importance of reporting
all crimes. RTD-PD also hosted several open houses for bus operators to obtain
information and best practices related to their safety directly.

RTD implemented many new tactics in 2024 designed to break down silos,
increase the flow of information, and ensure all employees are well informed. In
January, the agency implemented an all-digital version of Inside Connections, the
employee weekly newsletter. The interactive, virtual format has increased access
to real-time updates and garnered greater engagement. RTD also overhauled its
bi-monthly all-employee forums and weekly frontline staff bulletins.

Executive
Summary

Manager and Supervisor Training
In October 2023, RTD launched a comprehensive, six-part training for all
managers and supervisors. The in-person training seminars focused on enhancing
leadership skills, being an effective supervisor, instilling RTD’s values, and goal
setting, as well as other topics. The trainings went through June 2024 and will be
an ongoing part of RTD’s onboarding process for new managers and supervisors.

Elevator Pilot Program
In March, RTD launched its Customer Experience Elevator Pilot Program at three
light rail stations. Following a successful 90-day pilot, the program expanded to six
locations, with more in the works. The program entails elevator doors at stations
being reprogrammed to remain at rest in the open position to deter criminal or
unwanted activities inside the elevators. The initiative as part of the agency’s

Live Look-in on Buses and Trains
RTD completed a major technology project to enhance operator and customer
safety by installing live look-in equipment on all its bus fleet. The new system
enables RTD’s public safety dispatchers to both view and hear individuals,
situations, and events occurring on a vehicle in the moment. With the live look-in
system, RTD’s public safety dispatchers can use a secure, cellular network
connection to hear audio and view video in real time from the cameras on board
the vehicle. Currently, 20% of light rail vehicles have the live look-in capability.

New Fare Structure
For the first time ever, RTD lowered its fares for all services systemwide on Jan. 1.
The change resulted from a yearlong fare study and equity analysis aimed at
creating a fare structure that is more equitable, affordable and simple for
customers. As an example of the new lower fares, RTD’s monthly pass is now $88,
a discounted monthly pass is $27, and the LiVE program increased customer
discounts to 50%.

Police Department Growth
RTD-PD has continued momentum in building the agency’s police force. The
department aims to reduce criminal activity and improve the personal safety and
security of customers and employees on RTD property, stations, and vehicles.
Currently, 80 officers are in the department with another 10 candidates in police
academy training. RTD is actively shifting from contracted security personnel to
directly employing sworn officers. The addition of officers enables RTD-PD officers
to be a regular presence on buses and trains and at stops and stations.

Theft Report Cards
RTD Transit Police continues to issue Theft Report Cards at Park-N-Rides to make
customers aware of activities that make them targets for vehicle break-ins. If
police officers notice a vehicle with personal belongings in full view, they will
create a report card informing the owner of the unsafe practice. The report cards
make riders aware of unsafe practices while also suggesting ways to make their
vehicle less of a target in the future. Last year, RTD Transit Police issued more
than 5,300 report cards aimed at helping customers reduce their risk.

focuses on areas in need of greater safety efforts for bus and rail operators, such
as when employees begin their morning shifts at Denver Union Station. As the
police force continues to grow, the additional officers will help the department
proactively address other problems on bus and rail vehicles as well as situations at
stops and stations around the district.

Executive
Summary

Impact Team
The Impact Team Pilot Program commenced in May and included 45 employee
volunteer ambassadors. The focus of the program was to assist customers during
peak service times, planned and unplanned service disruptions, and large events
near RTD’s stops and stations. During the pilot program’s four-month period,
ambassadors completed sixty-one assignments, directly assisted more than 3,700
customers, and provided 232 hours of service.

Zero Fare to Vote
This year, RTD’s Board of Directors approved Zero Fare to Vote as an ongoing,
permanent fare change to encourage voter participation. Zero Fare to Vote will
occur every two years during the election cycle and removes a cost barrier for
people to travel on RTD services to cast their ballot. In 2024, with support from
the Colorado County Clerks Association, RTD services will be available at no cost
on National Vote Early Day and Election Day.

Zero Fare for Youth
RTD implemented Zero Fare for Youth as a permanent program in September,
allowing youth 19 and under to use all RTD services at no cost. The program
started as a one-year pilot program in 2023 to provide affordable, equitable, and
simple transit options for youth. RTD received positive feedback from many
schools about the program’s impact in reducing truancy, and it gained support
from school districts, youth organizations, and customers across the entire Denver
metro area.

White House Challenge Saving Lives from Overdoses
RTD is an active participant in a nationwide effort by the White House to increase
training and access to lifesaving opioid overdose reversal medications. The agency
was among the first five transit agencies to be called to participate. At RTD, opioid
overdose reversal medication is carried by all officers and contracted security
supervisors. In 2023, this medication was successfully administered to 103
individuals experiencing an overdose. RTD continues to be a nationwide leader in
the initiative and has provided support to other transit agencies.

Executive
Summary

Unhoused Outreach Coordinators and Mental Health Clinicians
RTD currently has two mental health clinicians, and a homeless outreach
coordinator working on behalf of RTD across its service area. Given the success of
the program, the agency is now actively recruiting to add three additional mental
health clinicians and four unhoused outreach coordinators. As part of the program,
a Transit Police officer accompanies a mental health clinician to provide referrals
and resources, rather than make an arrest for what could be misinterpreted as
criminal behavior rather than understood as a mental health crisis.

In April 2023, RTD pledged to support the NRSS goal of eliminating roadway
fatalities. At that time, the agency developed seven specific, internal goals aimed
at improving roadway safety. Focusing on the seven goals and related data has
helped RTD identify problem situations and address them in real time before a
bad outcome is realized. RTD’s efforts in this area have gained attention from the
U.S. Department of Transportation resulting in a request for RTD to present its
agency progress and methodology at a recent webinar in September 2024.

Customer-Facing Digital Signage Updates
In 2023, RTD began a customer amenities project to add approximately 130 large,
freestanding, walk-up screens at light rail and commuter rail stations. The digital
screens provide schedule information and promote the agency’s services, as well
as generate advertising revenue. Additional customer-facing digital signs are also
being installed at key bus stops, facilities, and transit centers across RTD’s service
area. RTD also launched an effort in 2024 to replace and install new variable
message signs (VMS) at all rail stations.

Reopening of the Downtown Boulder Station
In February, RTD reopened its Downtown Boulder Station following months of
remediation work to the facility. The interior of the station was initially closed in
2023 after methamphetamine residue was detected in the restrooms and found to
have entered the interior ductwork elsewhere in the station. As part of the work,
new sheet metal ductwork was installed with exterior insulation, allowing its
interior surface to be cleaned as needed. Ventilation within the restrooms was
improved, and a modest refresh of the station’s lobby was completed.

Executive
Summary

RTD-PD Cadet Program
RTD launched a new police cadet program for full-time college students in the
Denver metro area who are pursuing a criminal justice or related degree. Police
cadets will gain insight about the day-to-day work and obtain specialized training
for skills essential to pursuing a career in public safety. The program serves as a
resource to recruit potential RTD-PD officer candidates, and cadets can potentially
earn college credits.

Budget Summary: FY 2025

Materials and supplies increases are expected as RTD
adds revenue hours in alignment with its SOP. Repair
parts have experienced sharp increases in prices due to
the inflationary environment and are expected to
continue into 2025. RTD contracted in October 2024 to
lock in diesel fuel prices with an expected 400,000-gallon
locked price of $2.99/gallon. This prices will be carried
over into 2025, and a contracted price of $2.52/gallon for
and additional 6.75 million gallons necessary for FY 2025
usage.

Capital Expenditures

P

Capital expenditures for 2025 are largely driven by the
TAM Plan. Details of these budgeted capital expenditures
are provided herein and a schedule depicting and
describing the 2024 capital carryforward will also be
provided with the final recommended 2025 budget
appropriation.

The decrease in capital from 2024 is due mainly to the
2024 appropriation of capital for the multi-year light rail
reconstruction effort that was budgeted at $152 million in
2024, and unused appropriations will be carried forward
into 2025. This reconstruction effort will ensure RTD’s
light rail track and related infrastructure, that opened for
revenue service beginning in 1994, is maintained in a
state of good repair.

Benefit costs will increase along with new hires while, at
the same time, experiencing inflationary and claims
experience increases for certain health and welfare costs.
Certain health plans offered to employees will have
premium rate increases approaching 20%, for which RTD
will seek strategies to contain ongoing future large
increases. Retirement plans include a $15 million lump
sum contribution to the closed non-represented
employee pension plan, and a 9% of salaries contribution
to the non-represented employee defined contribution
plan. While CBA negotiations are ongoing, the FY 2025
budget contemplates a continuation of a 13% of wages
contribution to the closed represented employee pension
plan and a 9% contribution, with up to a 5% additional
matching contribution, to the represented employee
defined contribution plan currently budgeted.

Fiscal Year
2024

Sales and use tax revenue, which comprises more than
70% of RTD’s funding sources, is derived from the
September 2024 forecast provided by the University of
Colorado Leeds School of Business, and it anticipates
growth of 4.2%, after experiencing an estimated 1.0%
growth in 2024, as the economy is expected to stabilize
from prior high inflationary levels. These levels depressed
real incomes and spending. Grant revenue decreases
compared to 2024 are due to the one-time, pass-through
grant for the East Colfax Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Project
that was budgeted in 2024, however, RTD’s primary
source of ongoing grant revenue from Federal Transit
Administration (FTA) Section 5307 preventive
maintenance grants will continue to be a significant
source of funding in 2025. Overall, revenue is anticipated
to keep pace with increases in expenditures in 2025,
while also maintaining adequate reserves and supports
RTD’s Strategic Priority of Financial Success.

Salaries and wages will increase as RTD continues to
pursue its People Power Strategic Initiative to improve
hiring and retention, particularly for vacant frontline
positions, as well as the expansion of the Transit Police
division. Reduction of the 15% vacancy rate is expected
to occur while providing necessary resources to achieve
the System Optimization Plan (SOP). At the same time,
RTD is also providing support resources for frontline
positions. These increases will be partially offset by
expected reductions in voluntary overtime that has been
previously incurred to fill vacancies. Wage rate increases
have been included at a presumed inflationary rate,
however, Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA)
negotiations with the Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU)
Local 1001 are ongoing, and a final rate increase is yet to
be determined as part of that process.

Departments

The FY 2025 operating expense budget increases over
the 2024 budget are primarily due to increases expected
to occur in salaries, wages and benefits, materials and
supplies, and purchased transportation.

Operating Expenses

RTD’s 2025 operating revenue budget is expected to
decrease in the forthcoming year in comparison to the
one-time revenues budgeted in 2024. RTD conservatively
budgets for projected revenues in accordance with its
Fiscal Policy to only plan for revenue that is reasonably
certain to be collected. Fare revenue, grant revenue, and
other income are all based on projections from the
Board-approved 2025-2029 Five-Year Financial Forecast
(FYFF), utilizing modest assumptions in ridership growth,
actual grant apportionment information, and baseline
assumptions for other revenue, including advertising,
investment, and miscellaneous sources.

2025 Budget, however, state funding from SB24-032 in
the amount of $5 million is included for RTD to continue
its Zero Fare for Youth program. As additional

RTD will continue the multi-year light rail reconstruction
project in 2025. This ongoing project will maintain light
rail tracks in a state of good repair and aligns with the
Transit Asset Management (TAM) Plan. Funding for this
multi-phased reconstruction project will be carried over
for the unused portion of the 2024 Budget appropriation
of $152 million. Staff will continue to evaluate these TAM
Plan funding needs as additional rail condition
assessment information is collected, particularly
regarding the agency’s embedded track. An increase to
the Capital Replacement Fund during 2025 will provide
additional funding for future TAM needs, thereby
negating the need for additional borrowing.

RTD will continue to participate in discussions regarding
coordination with Colorado’s Front Range Passenger Rail
(FRPR) initiatives. RTD has not budgeted any funds for
this effort in FY 2025, but the agency is committed to
considering the future needs of this endeavor.

Fiscal Year
2024

The System Optimization Plan (SOP) will continually be
evaluated according to RTD’s Comprehensive Operational
Analysis (COA) during 2025, and service plan
modifications will be implemented in accordance with this
process during the planned January, May and September
2025 service changes. RTD may make other service
changes during the year, with Board approval, if
necessary. Staff intends to increase revenue service
hours by approximately 102,000 in 2025 according to the
SOP. This effort will require the continued pursuit of
recruitment and retention of additional front-line staff as
well as some additional supporting staff. Additional
funding for support vehicle maintenance is also
contemplated while provisions have been made for the
expected continued high cost of parts inventory that has
resulted from unprecedented inflation. The 2025 Budget
includes funding for these efforts and supporting
departmental budgets have been developed in concert
with these planned SOP changes to provide adequate
support.

Completion of the Facilities and Fleet Transition Plan
Study, which evaluates alternative low- and no-emission
fuel technologies, will continue to be evaluated with the
Board of Directors, and any recommended future
changes contemplated during FY 2025 for
implementation in future years. Funding for this plan was
appropriated in fiscal year 2024, but no additional
funding is contemplated in the 2025 budget at this time.

Executive
Summary

RTD will continue to pursue the Strategic Initiatives of
People Power, Back to Basics, and Welcoming Transit
Environment, with the introduction of Customer and
Community Connections, during fiscal year 2025. The
2021-2026 Strategic Plan allows for modifications, as
necessary, with Board approval. Work tactics surrounding
the four Strategic Initiatives may change during the year,
at the direction of the General Manager and CEO, to
ensure the agency is agile and able to address
environmental conditions and changing needs.

RTD forecasts its revenues conservatively to ensure that
only reasonably certain funding sources are
contemplated when developing expenditures and
considering fiscal constraints. This approach provides
improved budget certainty while also supporting fiscal
sustainability. RTD has evaluated the potential effects of
revenue growth limitations from the Taxpayer’s Bill of
Rights (TABOR) which becomes effective in 2025. TABOR
growth limitations could potentially affect up to 50% of
RTD’s revenues, but staff does not anticipate refunds to
taxpayers being required for 2025. The November 2024
general election includes a ballot initiative seeking voter
approval to continue RTD’s exemption from TABOR
revenue growth limits. Any necessary 2025 budget
amendments due to the results of this ballot initiative will
be addressed with the Board of Directors in 2025.

Fiscal Year
2024

The 2025 Budget includes an assumed 4.2% increase in
tax collections from 2024, as outlined in the 30-year tax
forecast provided by the University of Colorado Leeds
School of Business. Sales and use taxes will continue to
comprise approximately 75% of RTD’s revenue sources
in 2025. Operating and capital grants appear lower in the
2025 Budget compared to 2024 due to the one-time
inclusion of a pass-through grant of $150 million to the
City and County of Denver for the East Colfax Avenue
BRT Project, which is anticipated to open for revenue
service in 2027. This pass-through grant had no financial
impact to RTD.

The 2025 budgeted grant revenue is primarily comprised
of FTA Section 5307 grant annual apportionments for
preventive maintenance, as well as a $5 million state
grant for the Zero Fare for Youth program. Other
revenue comprises just 3% of total revenue and consists
of investment income, advertising, and other
miscellaneous revenue. It is expected to be relatively flat
when compared to 2024.

Executive
Summary

The revenue in FY 2025 is budgeted to decrease
compared to the 2024 Budget. The 2024 customer fares
were estimated with the implementation of RTD’s new
fare structure, which took place in January 2024.
However, actual results during 2024 have been lower
than anticipated. The 2025 fares contemplate the current
experience, including continuation of the Zero Fare for
Youth program and have been budgeted lower by $6.8
million. Fares continue to provide approximately 5% of
RTD’s revenues. Sales and use taxes have been flat
between 2023 and 2024.

Operating expenses will increase in FY 2025 compared to
the 2024 Budget, excluding the 2024 East Colfax BRT
grant of $150 million by $89.1 million.

Utilities, which are primarily comprised of energy costs
for facilities and traction power, are anticipated to remain
relatively flat in 2025 due to expected continued similar
volume usage and no significant rate increases assumed.

Purchased transportation will increase in accordance with
bus fixed route contractual increases and the
concessionaire agreement for commuter rail services.
Contractual increases account for inflation as well as
periodic maintenance costs. These periodic increases in
payments will continue from 2025-2027 before being
reduced and will be funded from the FasTracks Internal
Savings Account (FISA).

Insurance costs are relatively small in relation to overall
expenses but are expected increase in 2025 due to
claims experience and increasing premiums. RTD is selfinsured for general liability and worker’s compensation
claims. RTD has certain excess liability limits under the
Colorado Government Immunity Act for claims involving
personal injury and property damage.

Financial
Analysis

Materials and supplies increases are expected as RTD
adds revenue hours in alignment with its SOP.
Replacement parts have experienced sharp increases in
prices due to the inflationary environment, as well as
supply chain issues, and it is expected to continue into
2025. RTD contracted in October 2024 to lock in diesel
fuel prices, with an expected 400,000-gallon locked price
of $2.99/gallon to be carried over into 2025, and a
contracted price of $2.52/gallon for and additional 6.75
million gallons necessary for 2025.

The “other expenses” category includes miscellaneous
transactions and adjustments.

Additional increases in benefit rates will also occur due to
the additional employees and adverse health claims
experience. Retirement plans include a $15 million lump
sum contribution to the closed non-represented
employee pension plan, and a 9% of salaries contribution
to the non-represented employee defined contribution
plan. While CBA negotiations are ongoing, the 2025
Budget contemplates a continuation of a contribution of
13% of wages to the closed represented employee
pension plan, and a 9% contribution with up to a 5%
additional matching contribution to the represented
employee defined contribution plan.

Fiscal Year

Leases and rentals comprise a small portion of RTD’s
expenses, and those costs will remain flat in 2025
compared to 2024. These costs are primarily related to
facility leases such as the Civic Center Building, and other
certain smaller agreements associated with
communication towers and storage facilities.

Executive
Summary

Salaries and benefits include a $52.5 million increase due
continuation of frontline position hiring in support of the
System Optimization Plan (SOP). This increase adds
102,000 revenue hours in 2025. Wage rate increases
have been included at a presumed inflationary rate,
however, Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA)
negotiations with the Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU)
Local 1001 are ongoing, and a final rate increase is yet to
be determined.

Outside services will decrease significantly in 2025 due to
the one-time nature of the East Colfax BRT pass-through
grant that was appropriated in 2024. It will be carried
forward in the 2025 budget, thereby not necessitating
additional appropriation.

Debt Service by Issuance Type

Executive
Summary

The following charts display RTD's debt service obligations. These obligations include revenue bonds, lease-purchase
agreements, also known as Certificates of Participation (COPs), and other multi-year obligations. Other obligations
include RTD’s public-private partnership (P3) concessionaire agreement, which financed the design and construction of
the EAGLE Project. These charts provide debt service information and show the different components by type of
obligation, fund (Base System versus FasTracks), and the interest and principal. All obligations have fixed interest rates
and terms and are not subject to acceleration.

More information about RTD’s TAM Plan is available in the Appendix.
Along with information about its support of the agency’s financial planning process,
a categorical projects list with locations and descriptions is also available.

Executive
Summary

RTD is continuing its efforts to improve and complete the TAM inventory of assets while also gathering Asset
Information Maturity (AIM) data to assist in evaluating the condition of assets to adequately plan for repairs and
replacements. Gathering this information is a multi-year effort and is contemplated in RTD’s internal initiative to
improve the financial planning process. That process was described in the July 2024 Board presentation of the 20252029 Five-Year Financial Forecast (FYFF), and it is expected to reach a more mature level for use by 2027. The process
includes three generations of implementation with the initial steps implemented in 2024 and continuous improvement
achieved in the following years.

Attachment: FY2025_Budget_2024-11-11_SMALL [Revision 1] (5023 : 2025 Proposed Budget)

The Transit Asset Management (TAM) Plan provides RTD with information to plan for the repair and replacement of
assets, with a specific focus on maintaining a state of good repair. RTD currently has over $9.3 billion in capital assets
that have been placed in service over long periods of time.

The 2025-2029 combined cash flow projections and fund balances are provided below:

Attachment: FY2025_Budget_2024-11-11_SMALL [Revision 1] (5023 : 2025 Proposed Budget)

The FYFF provides the basis for preparation of the annual budget and the 30-year forecast. For budgeting purposes,
the FYFF provides target funding constraints to ensure fiscal sustainability. Combined with RTD’s Fiscal Policy to
maintain certain reserve levels as well as the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan, the FYFF ensures that budget appropriations
are aligned with expectations of Financial Success and maintenance of a healthy financial position.

Executive
Summary

The 2025-2029 Five-year Financial Forecast (FYFF) was approved by the Board on September 24, 2024. The FYFF is
not an appropriation but a planning tool which is useful, from a financial perspective, to evaluate fiscal sustainability.
In addition to this five-year forecast, RTD also periodically prepares a 30-year long-range forecast in coordination with
the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) and other local municipalities with the Denver Regional Council of
Governments (DRCOG) as a component of the metro area Transportation Improvement Plan (TIP) which is required for
RTD to continue to receive federal grant funding.

Reconciling items reflect cash activity in capital projects, inventory, accounts receivable and prepaids, accruals and capitalized interest.

2

Reserves include funds that are legally restricted by bond covenants, other contracts, Board designation and policy guidelines.

3

Reserves are an appropriated reserve which is available to fund unforseen projects expenses (such as a contingency reserve).
Reserves respresent revenues that are designated to be spent in future years for the construction of the FasTracks capital program.

About
RTD

Introductory information about RTD’s TAM Plan is available on page 61.

Reporting by Asset Classification
RTD structures its asset reporting by asset class rather
than by individual department to align with best practices
established by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA)
and National Transit Database (NTD) requirements. This
approach ensures consistent reporting, facilitates
regulatory compliance, and improves overall
management. More information is available in the 2024
NTD Policy Manual.

The TAM Plan offers a structured management
framework for planning asset investments, providing
strategic guidance to the financial planning process.
While the FYFF and annual budget serve as the
mechanisms through which these asset strategies are
implemented, based on practical financial constraints.
This combined yet distinct relationship between the three
ensures that RTD balances long-term asset stewardship
with fiscal responsibility, ultimately supporting the
agency’s goal of making lives better thought connections.

Financial
Analysis

The TAM Plan influences the budget by identifying and
prioritizing capital investment needs for assets. This
ensures that the investments reflected in the annual
budget are aligned with asset management goals and
support the agency’s long-term mission of delivering
safe, reliable service. However, because the budget is a
dynamic document responding to real-time financial
conditions, it may not fully fund all TAM priorities each
year. As such, the unfunded needs identified in the TAM
Plan are retained for future consideration within the
evolving budget cycle.

This asset class-based method allows for more
transparent and uniform tracking and monitoring of
investment needs across the organization. Reporting by
asset class ensures comparability with other transit
agencies, meeting NTD standards, and enabling better
decision-making. By utilizing asset class reporting, RTD
avoids the complexity and redundancy of reconciling data
across multiple departments, ultimately improving
transparency, and operational efficiency.

While the TAM Plan outlines long-term asset needs,
including renewal and replacement schedules, the FYFF
aligns funding priorities with identified needs. The
financial forecast also considers external factors such as
economic conditions, sales tax projections, and
operational costs. Although both processes aim to inform
decision-making, the TAM Plan emphasizes asset lifecycle
management, whole-life cost analysis, and risk
management, whereas the budget focuses on near-term
resource allocation and fiscal accountability.

One key reason for using asset classes is the crossfunctional nature of many transit assets. For example,
support vehicles may be procured and maintained by the
Bus Operations team, but the support vehicles are used
by other departments. Similarly, the Rail Operations
group may manage day-to-day use of infrastructure,
while capital renewal projects are overseen by Capital
Programs. This makes department-level ownership
ambiguous, leading to reporting challenges if the focus
were departmental rather than on asset functionality.

Executive
Summary

TAM Plan and Financial Planning
RTD’s TAM Plan and financial framework, including the
Five-Year Financial Forecast (FYFF), work in tandem to
support sustainable transit operations. The two also
serve distinct purposes. The TAM Plan is a strategic
planning tool focused on managing and maintaining
RTD’s assets over time, in compliance to federal
requirements, particularly those under 49 CFR Part 625.
Its primary role is to ensure assets are maintained in a
state of good repair (SGR), providing safe, reliable
services to the community. The FYFF and budget, on the
other hand, translate these strategic priorities and other
non-asset related agency needs into actionable financial
commitments based on projected and available financial
resources.

On Friday, October 4, 2024, RTD produced a draft version of its proposed Fiscal Year 2025 Budget Book (Budget Book).
The draft book was included in the Board’s Finance and Planning Committee agenda packet and posted online at rtddenver.com/budget. During the Finance and Planning Committee meeting on Tuesday, October 8, Directors provided
feedback about the Budget Book and suggested revisions. Additionally, staff carefully combed through the Budget Book to
make grammatical corrections and minor financial adjustments. To ensure all edits and revisions are clearly noted, the table

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Zero Fares on Transit Equity Day 2025

November 12, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
December 3, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors (Board) to authorize the General Manager and CEO, or her designee, to
implement zero fares on February 4, 2025 (Transit Equity Day) and to further authorize the annual
implementation of zero-fare day for each Transit Equity Day thereafter.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Carl Green Jr., Director, Civil Rights Division
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
Transit Equity Day is a National Day of Action to commemorate the birthday of Rosa Parks by declaring
that public transit is a civil right. Rosa Parks, a Black woman, was born on February 4, 1913, in
Tuskegee, Alabama. On December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks was arrested and fined in Montgomery,
Alabama, for refusing to give up her seat on a bus to a white man, in violation of a city ordinance and
Alabama state law that required segregation on public buses. Following her arrest, Jo Ann Robinson, an
activist during the Civil Rights Movement, and others copied tens of thousands of leaflets and distributed
them across the city calling for a bus boycott. By refusing to comply with Montgomery’s segregation
law, Rosa Parks catalyzed the 381-day bus boycott of the Montgomery bus system by approximately
40,000 customers, led by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and the Montgomery Improvement Association.
On February 1, 1956, a district court case entitled Aurelia S. Browder v. William A. Gayle was filed to
challenge the Alabama state statutes and Montgomery city ordinances requiring segregation on city
buses. On June 5, 1956, the panel ruled two-to-one that segregation on Alabama’s intrastate buses was
unconstitutional. Filed by Fred Gray and Charles D. Langford on behalf of four African American women
(Aurelia S. Browder, Susie McDonald, Claudette Colvin and Mary Louise Smith) who had been
mistreated on city buses, the case made its way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which on November 13,
1956, upheld the district court ruling that the statute was unconstitutional. On December 17, 1956, the
Supreme Court rejected city and state appeals to reconsider their decision, and three days later, the
order for integrated buses arrived in Montgomery. On December 20, 1956, the Montgomery
Improvement Association voted to end the 381-day Montgomery bus boycott.
Rosa Parks is widely considered the “Mother of the Freedom Movement” and the “First Lady of Civil
Rights.” The courageous acts of Parks and the four plaintiffs in the Browder v. Gayle case marked an

Packet Pg. 155

17.B

important assertion of equal rights for African Americans, women and other marginalized groups in the
United States. Parks was the first woman to join the Montgomery chapter of the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), where she served as secretary of the branch and was
later elected secretary of the statewide NAACP. She participated in the 1963 March on Washington and
the Selma to Montgomery March for voting rights in 1965. Parks went on to receive many awards,
including the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1996. She died in 2005 at the age of 92.
DISCUSSION
First celebrated federally by the U.S. Department of Transportation in 2021, Transit Equity Day
commemorates the life and legacy of iconic civil rights leader Rosa Parks on her birthday. Gaining wider
adoption in 2023, 15 public transit agencies in cities throughout the United States celebrated Transit
Equity Day to promote equity in public transportation and raise awareness about the critical importance
of transit to all members of the community, including the historically underserved. In observance of
Transit Equity Day, many public transportation systems offer no-cost fares for all customers, as well as
host ceremonies with local officials and community-based organizations (e.g., local NAACP branches).
Many leave a seat vacant on buses in honor of Parks. February 4, 2025, would have been Parks’ 112th
birthday. It is important not to consider Rosa Parks as a woman who sat down to “stand up” one day on
a bus, but instead remember her as a woman who stood up every day. The essence of this philosophy is
embodied in Transit Equity Day.
The Board of Directors’ policy adoption to provide system-wide zero-fare transit on Transit Equity Day
would demonstrate the agency’s commitment to the Strategic Priorities of Community Value and
Customer Excellence. Moreover, the Board would honor the legacy of Rosa Parks and other civil rights
pioneers that dedicated their lives to the cause of human rights and truly embodied the love of humanity
and freedom. Transit Equity Day would also serve to recognize the present and future legacies of the
civil rights and social justice movements in Colorado and nationally as well as highlight the
intersectionality of diverse communities, lived experiences and personal identities in the Denver metro
area. Lastly, this would empower communities to enjoy a better quality of life by helping to remove the
limitations of and barriers to mobility and embracing the ideals of Transit Equity Day — on February 4
and throughout the entire year.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The cumulative annual occurring financial impact to provide zero-fare for transit equity day is
approximately $265,000. The average daily operational cost of providing weekday transit service include
the following:
Fare Revenue Replacement: $239,000 per weekday
Law Enforcement and Security: $11,000 per day
Marketing: up to $15,000 annually

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Salaried Trustee Appointment

November 12, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
December 3, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve Resolution No. ______, Series of 2024, reappointing Jennie Waski,
Senior Specialist, Benefits, as a Trustee with a term expiring December 31, 2026, and appointing
Anthony Sabia, Director, Total Rewards, Vince Buzek, RTD Board Director, and Troy Whitmore, RTD
Board Director, as Trustees with terms expiring December 31, 2026, to the Salaried Employee Defined
Benefit Pension Plan (DB plan) and Salaried Employee Defined Contribution Retirement Plan (DC plan)
Trusts.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
On January 8, 2008, the Board of Directors adopted Resolution No. 001, Series of 2008 (Resolution No.
1), which established a committee composed of the Board Chair, the Chair of the Salaried Employee
Pension Trust Fund, and the Finance Chair (i.e., the Chair of the Finance Administration and Audit
Committee as it existed at that time) to screen applications from prospective pension and DC plan
Trustees from among “the middle management salaried employee class and the senior management
salaried employee class and…[to] bring recommendations back to the Board.”
As a revision to the process established in Resolution No. 001, the Board adopted Resolution No. 27,
Series of 2010, which stated that, “for reappointment of Trustees who have served satisfactorily and in
whose education the Trusts have made substantial investments, it is not necessary to seek applications
for renewal, and instead the application process established by the Board in 2008 would be used on
those occasions when the Board finds it necessary or appropriate to appoint new salaried Trustees to
the Trusts.”
On May 31, 2016, in Resolution No. 008, Series of 2016 (Resolution No. 008), the Board of Directors
amended the Defined Benefit Pension Trust and the Defined Contribution Retirement Trust (Trusts,
collectively) to remove the “senior” and “middle” management distinction established in Resolution No.
001. Instead, Resolution No. 008 authorized the Board to appoint two employee Trustees who
participate in the pension plan and two who participate in the DC plan, as well as two Directors
appointed to the Trusts and the Chief Financial Officer who is a permanent member of the Trusts, to
serve as the same Trustees on both trusts.

17.C

DISCUSSION
In adopting this recommended action, the agency demonstrates its commitment to meet the Strategic
Priorities of Employee Ownership and Financial Success.
RTD provides a DB pension plan to non-represented (salaried) employees hired before January 1, 2008,
and a DC retirement plan to salaried employees hired thereafter. Each plan is overseen by a Board of
Trustees comprised of four RTD staff, two RTD Board members and RTD’s Chief Financial Officer
serving as a permanent Trustee. RTD staff Trustees are recommended to the RTD Board by the General
Manager and CEO for appointment, and the RTD Board Chair, with full RTD Board approval, appoints
two RTD Board members as Trustees.
Trustees serve staggered terms of two years.
This action item seeks Board seeks the following for approval:
• Extend through December 31, 2026, the term of current Trustee Jennie Waski, Senior Specialist,
Benefits, whose term expires on December 31, 2024
• Replace current Trustee William Weidenaar, Manager, Vehicle Engineering, whose term expires
December 31, 2024, with Anthony Sabia, Director, Total Rewards with a term expiring December
31, 2026
• Replace current Trustee Bob Broom, RTD Board Director, whose term expires December 31,
2024, with Vince Buzek, RTD Board Director, with a term expiring December 31, 2026
• Replace current Trustee Bobby Dishell, RTD Board Director, whose term expires December 31,
2024, with Troy Whitmore, RTD Board Director, with a term expiring December 31, 2026
The above actions will result in a body of seven Trustees with one active Trustee being a participant in
the closed DB pension plan.
The term extensions and appointment of these Trustees will focus Trust governance with employees
who participate in and represent staff colleagues participating in these retirement plans, have expertise
in the areas of human resources, health and wellness benefits and finance as well as maintain Board
participation in the salaried employee retirement Trusts in its capacity as a policy-making body.
Further, the Trust plan documents will continue to require Board approval for changes in plan design and
annual budget appropriation in addition to any material changes to the plans coming to the Board
through the Audit Committee.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with the adoption of this recommended action.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
January 2025 Title VI Service Equity Analysis

November 14, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
December 3, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors (Board) to adopt the Title VI Service Equity Analysis report for January 2025
service changes to comply with federal laws, regulations and guidelines related to Title VI of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Martin Romero, Transit Equity Manager, Civil Rights Division
Carl Green Jr., Director of the Civil Rights Division
Jessie Carter II, Senior Manager, Service Planning and Scheduling
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
The 27 service changes proposed for January 2025 facilitate opportunities for bus and rail personnel to
select new work assignments and for the Service Development Division to adjust the overall operations
plan for the transit network. Additionally, with the Board’s adoption of the Reimagine RTD System
Optimization Plan (SOP), several of the service change proposals reflect the first phases of SOP
implementation to provide the best possible value to customers.
The Board-adopted guidance for proposed service changes continues to be:
• Service performance evaluation based on service standards
• Maintaining the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets
• Making alternative services available to affected customers
• Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible
• Compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard
to race, color or national origin; also, disparate effects on low-income and minority populations
• Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
Service Equity Analysis Requirements of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI and Environmental Justice. In this
circular, the FTA requires RTD to evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that
exceed the established major service change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a
disproportionately negative impact on minority or low-income populations. The January 2025 service

Packet Pg. 164

17.D

change proposal includes eight major service changes out of 27 total changes. Thus, an analysis is
required to be brought before the Board for its consideration. The complete Title VI Service Equity
Analysis report is included in Attachment A.
Title VI Service Equity Analysis Policies
Per FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Major Service Change Policy, a Disparate
Impact Policy and a Disproportionate Burden Policy. Collectively, these policies provide the foundational
requirements for evaluating service change proposals for equity. These policies and their applicable
thresholds are listed below:
Major Service Change Policy:
A major service change is defined as a 25% addition or reduction in the service hours of any route that
would remain in effect for 12 or more months. All major service changes will be subject to an equity
analysis.
Title VI Policies:
• Disparate Impact Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a minority population
10% more than non-minority populations; this level of impact is considered a disparate impact.
•

Disproportionate Burden Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a low-income
population 10% more than higher-income populations; this level of impact is considered a
disproportionate burden. A low-income population is a group of households who are at or below
150% of the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.

DISCUSSION
Staff proposes changes to 22 bus routes, two FlexRide zones, and three rail lines commencing January
2025. Of these changes, eight services have proposed additions to service 25% greater than that of
baseline service and thus meet established thresholds for a major service change. Those routes are
shown in bold in the following table.

Methodology: Disparate impact and disproportionate burden analyses were performed at the route/line
level, route/line block group, and network level to identify any potential disparities in service changes
based on race/ethnicity or income.

Packet Pg. 165

17.D

Summary of Findings:
• Potential disparate impacts and disproportionate burdens were identified at the individual route
level: of the eight bus routes with major service changes (Routes 35, 49, 83D, 100, 139, AB1,
FF5, and LD1), three routes (Routes 100, AB1, and LD1) had a potential disparate impact finding,
and one route (Route 139) had a potential disproportionate burden finding.
o Route 100 has a potential disparate impact finding due to minority populations receiving
0.42% less benefit than non-minority populations. Low-income populations receive 0.03%
more benefit than non-low-income populations.
o Route 139 has a potential disproportionate burden finding due to low-income populations
receiving 0.18% less benefit than non-low-income populations. Minority populations
receive 0.18% more benefit than non-minority populations.
o Route AB1 has a potential disparate impact finding due to minority populations receiving
0.39% less benefit than non-minority populations. Low-income populations receive 1.09%
more benefit than non-low-income populations.
o Route LD1 has a potential disparate impact finding due to minority populations receiving
0.21% less benefit than non-minority populations. Low-income populations receive 0.05%
more benefit than non-low-income populations.
o While not considered a major service change, the truncation of the Route 1 impacts equity
(i.e., minority and low-income) populations more than non-equity (i.e., non-minority and
non-low-income) populations. Minority populations are impacted 0.53% more than nonminority populations. Additionally, low-income populations are impacted 1.01% more than
non-low-income populations. Truncation of the Route 44 also has a potential
disproportionate burden finding due to low-income populations being impacted 1.0% more
than non-low-income populations (whereas populations are impacted 0.09% less than nonminority populations). On the other hand, the merger of segments from Routes 1 and 44
into the 1/44E Art District Connector had no potential findings and will maintain service
availability to the truncated portions of the Routes 1 and 44.
•

The proposed major service changes were examined in aggregate, at the network level, to
determine overall impacts to equity populations compared to non-equity populations. At the
network level, minority populations stand to benefit more than non-minority populations (10.61%
vs. 10.32% respectively). This difference does not meet the disparate impact threshold of
9.29%. Therefore, no system-level disparate impact finding is found with the proposed major
service increases. Low-income populations stand to benefit more than non-low-income
populations (12.8% vs. 9.89%, respectively). The difference does not meet the 10%
disproportionate burden threshold of 8.9%. Therefore, no system-level disproportionate burden is
found with the proposed major service increases.

Conclusions:
Although three major service changes resulted in a potential disparate impact and one major service
change resulted in a potential disproportionate burden at the route level, staff recommends the January
2025 service plan as proposed, as there are no practical alternatives to avoid, minimize, or mitigate the
potential disparate impacts and disproportionate burden. Additionally, the network-level analysis provides
holistic understanding of changes to service levels for Title VI-protected populations across the service

Packet Pg. 166

17.D

area compared to the route level. The analysis revealed no network-level findings. In fact, both minority
and low-income populations stand to benefit more at the network level from the major service changes
than non-minority and non-low-income populations. All eight bus routes facing major service changes
serve higher than average low-income populations, and three of the routes serve higher than average
minority populations with only three improvements (specifically, to the Routes 100, AB1 and LD1)
serving areas with relatively low minority populations as compared to non-minority populations.
Improving service on these routes does not raise concerns of inequitable distribution of benefits given
the results of the network-level analysis indicating that Title VI concerns are minimal (0.42%, 0.18%,
0.39% and 0.21%, respectively).
In adopting this report, the agency seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan priority of Community
Value while maintaining compliance with Title VI federal regulations. RTD will continue to assess the
equity implications for all subsequent service change proposals and will propose adjustments and service
alternatives as appropriate in future service change recommendations.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The adoption of the Title VI Service Equity Analysis will not result in any direct or foreseeable financial
impacts.

Executive Summary
This document summarizes the analysis of major service changes proposed for January 2025 to ensure that
the changes will not inequitably impact minority and low-income populations.

Methodology

RTD’s established Title VI program methodology defines the process to identify major service changes, disparate
impacts and disproportionate burdens. Analyses were performed at the route and block group levels to identify
any potential disparities in service changes based on race/ethnicity or income.

Major Service Changes

RTD proposes changes to 22 bus routes, two FlexRide zones and three rail lines of RTD’s forthcoming
January 2025 service change. Of this change, eight services meet established thresholds for a major service
change. The service tabulated below has proposed adjustments that were greater than 25% of baseline service
and are proposed for the long-term (will remain in effect for 12 or more months).
Route Modification
(one service)

Route 35: As described in the SOP, segment reinstated east of Englewood
Station to Nine Mile Station primarily along Hampden Avenue
Route 49: Daily service frequency increased to 30 minutes throughout the
service day; service span expanded to extend to 11 p.m. on weekdays, to
commence at 5 a.m. and extend through 11 p.m. on Saturdays, and to
commence at 6 a.m. and extend through 8 p.m. on Sundays
Route 83D: Weekday midday and evening service increased to 30-minute
frequency
Route 100: Service frequency increased between Federal Center Station (W
Line) and Arvada Ridge Station (G Line)

Service Increases
(seven services)

Route 139: Service spans expanded to extend two hours later on weekdays and
to commence one hour earlier and extend two hours later on Saturdays and
Sundays
Route AB1: AB2 trips reinstated from Downtown Boulder Station; daily service
increased to 30-minute frequency throughout the service day
Route FF5: 3:02 p.m. eastbound trip added from Downtown Boulder Station to
Anschutz; 2:45 p.m. westbound FF5 trip shifted to 2:30 p.m.; eastbound 4:02
p.m. trip added to interline with current westbound trip at 5:15 p.m.
Route LD1: Two morning and two afternoon/evening peak trips added from
Bross St/8th Ave to Denver Union Station in each direction

Minor Service Changes

The service tabulated below has proposed adjustments that were less than 25% of baseline service. This includes
one route merger proposal that, while not currently included in the major service change policy, represents a
significant change to the alignments of two bus routes. Other adjustments include service increases under the
major service change threshold and schedule timing changes.

Schedule Timing
(Five services)

Route 42: Running time adjustments due to changes on Route 45
Route 52: Schedule adjustments to improve on-time performance for all
service days
Route 65: Schedule adjustments to improve on-time performance for all
service days
Route 76: Schedule adjustments to improve on-time performance on
weekdays
NB: Minor changes to weekday schedule to account for class start/end times at
Boulder High and Nederland High, as well as operational hours at Eldora Ski
Resort
D Line: Schedule adjustments due to ongoing maintenance work

Service Increase
(Six services)

Route 24: Service spans expanded to extend two hours later on weekdays,
and commence one hour earlier extend and two hours later on Saturdays and
Sundays
Route 73: Daily service span increased to provide later evening trips
Route 205/205T: Tripper service added to address overloads on Route BOLT
due to increase in Boulder High School usage
Route 208: School tripper service added to address overloads on the regular
scheduled 7:51 a.m. westbound trip due to increase in Boulder High School
usage
E Line: Reinstatement of 15-minute frequency (temporary change)
H Line: Reinstatement of 15-minute frequency (temporary change)

Route Adjustment
(Seven services)

Route 1: Service east of 17th/18th Streets truncated and rerouted to Civic
Center Station via Broadway/Lincoln. The new routing would serve the current
alignment between Lakewood Commons and 17th/Stout.
Route 15: Routing updated to reflect a current detour, which removes access
to the stop at 13th Avenue/Lisbon Street, due to inability to reliably and in the
safest manner, resume westbound operations after serving the stop. Service to
13th Avenue/Lisbon Street bus stop will start as soon as the traffic signal is
completed at Colfax Avenue/Picadilly Street.
Route 44: Service east of 17th/18th Streets truncated and rerouted service to
Civic Center Station via Broadway/Lincoln. The new routing would serve the
current alignment between Wheat Ridge/Ward Road Station and 17th/California
Streets.
Route 45: Routing updated to reflect ongoing westbound detour related to left
turn at unsignalized intersection from Ireland St onto 56th Ave. Buses will
operate in a loop via Maxwell, right on Dunkirk, right on 56th Ave and right on
Ireland. Buses will serve the same stops on Ireland St, Dunkirk and 56th Ave in
both directions. Original routing will be restored when a traffic signal at the
intersection is installed and operable
Route 1E/44 (Art District Connector): Eastern portion of the Route 1 and
Route 44 combined, connecting the Baker and Five Points neighborhoods from
Alameda Station to 40th/Colorado Station; the western portions of the Routes 1
(Lakewood Commons to Civic Center Station) and 44 (Wheat Ridge/Ward
Station to Civic Center Station) retained into downtown Denver, with the new
merged routing renamed as the ART Connector
NBFX (Broomfield North FlexRide): Boundaries expanded to include a new
area
ILFX (Interlocken/Westmoor FlexRide): Service boundaries expanded to
include a new affordable housing development

Findings

Major service changes included in the 27 proposed January 2025 service changes include route adjustments
as well as service increases to eight bus routes. Of the eight routes with major service changes, three serve
populations that are above the district average of minority populations, and all eight serve populations that are
above the district average for low-income populations.
When considering the demographics within the service area (within a quarter mile) of the major service increases
and as a proportion to the district overall, low-income populations receive a higher increase in service
(i.e., were more positively impacted) compared to non-low-income populations. Low-income areas received
2.92% more of a benefit than non-low-income areas. This difference is above the 10% minimum threshold.
Minority areas received more of an increase in service (i.e., were more positively impacted) compared to
non-minority populations. Minority areas benefitted 0.29% more than non-minority areas, a difference above
the 10% threshold.
Finally, potential disparate impact findings were identified at the route level for the changes proposed for
Routes 100, AB1 and LD1 and a potential disproportionate burden for Route 139.

Introduction
Title VI and Environmental Justice

Equity is a core principle of RTD’s functional mission to provide mass transit service within the Denver region.
An equitable mass transit system fairly distributes the benefits and adverse effects of transit service without
regard for race, color, national origin, or low-income status. This principle is detailed and reinforced by Title VI
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Executive Order 12898 pertaining to environmental justice.
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin in
programs receiving federal financial assistance. Specifically, Title VI states, “No person in the United States shall,
on the ground of race, color or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or
be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”
In 1994, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12898, which states that each federal agency “shall make
achieving environmental justice part of its mission by identifying and addressing disproportionately high and
adverse human health or environmental effects of its programs, policies, and activities on minority populations
and low-income populations.”
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial assistance
with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI and Environmental Justice. In this circular, the FTA
requires RTD to evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that exceed the established major
service change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a disproportionately negative impact
on minority or low-income populations.
This equity analysis report has been prepared to document changes that are proposed to occur between the
current and proposed runboards. Routes with major service changes include one major increase and one
reinstatement of a formerly suspended route pattern. These changes and all others have been reviewed
individually at the route/line level and in aggregate at the block group level to identify potential impacts to the
communities RTD serves.

Service Change Philosophy

An equity analysis is triggered by proposed major service changes to the transit services provided by RTD. These
changes include the addition of new routes/lines, the elimination of existing routes/lines and changes to the
alignment and trip frequency within existing routes/lines. RTD has established principles to identify the service
changes needed to meet the diverse travel needs of those within the district and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system.

Response to changes in the communities where services are provided

RTD services are divided into various service classes (Family of Services) depending on service type, route
alignment and frequency. Each service class has its own service standards derived from the performance of all
routes within each class. RTD continually and comprehensively adjusts services in response to changes in
ridership and operational performance of the transit system. It is also the agency’s responsibility to identify
services that are underperforming and recommend modifications, curtailment or cancellation of service as
warranted. In keeping with Colorado Revised Statutes, RTD utilizes official service standards to establish
performance metrics used to identify underperforming services on a class-of-service basis. The agency uses
these metrics to identify a series of service changes. Equity analyses examine the impact of the proposed major
service changes on minority populations and low-income households at or below 150 percent of the Department
of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.

…The general assembly further finds that the district should be organized efficiently,
economically, and on a demand-responsive basis and that the district should consider least-cost
alternatives in discharging its responsibilities.

RTD’s Title VI Equity Analysis Policies
Based on requirements within FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD, as an agency receiving federal funding,
must establish a Major Service Change Policy, a Disparate Impact Policy and a Disproportionate Burden Policy.
Collectively, these policies provide foundational requirements for evaluating service change proposals for equity
and compliance with Title VI. These policies and their applicable thresholds are listed below:
1. Major Service Change: A major service change is defined as a 25% addition or reduction in the
service hours of any route that would remain in effect for 12 or more months. All major service
changes will be subject to an equity analysis that includes an analysis of adverse effects.
a. An Adverse Effect is defined as a geographical or temporal reduction in service that includes,
but is not limited to, eliminating a route, shortening a route by eliminating segments, rerouting
an existing route and increasing headways. RTD shall consider the degree of adverse effects
and analyze those effects when planning major service changes.
2. Disparate Impact Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a minority population 10
percent more than non-minority populations; this level of impact is considered a disparate impact.
3. Disproportionate Burden Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a low-income
population 10% more than non-low-income populations; this level of impact is considered a
disproportionate burden. A low-income population is a group of households who are at or below 150%
of the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.
If a proposed major service change results in a disparate impact or a disproportionate burden, RTD will consider
modifying the proposed service change. RTD will then analyze the modification and make sure it removed the
potential disparate impact or disproportionate burden. If a less discriminatory option cannot be identified and

RTD can demonstrate a substantial legitimate justification for the proposed service change, the FTA may allow
RTD to proceed with the proposed change.

Analysis
Data Sources and Methodology

Demographic data used for this analysis comes from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) 5Year Estimates for years 2018 to 2022 and is reviewed at the census block group geographic level. Other data
related to the analysis includes route alignments and block group geography. The linking of these datasets into
a service-geographic-demographic combination relates equity populations with changes in service at a
geographic level to aid in reviewing potential impacts to district equity communities.
The equity analysis for the January 2025 service change looked at whether an individual bus route’s or rail
line’s major service changes impacted the communities it served. The review needed to determine the
proportional difference in changes made to equity populations within a quarter-mile service area of a bus route
or rail line. These proportional differences were compared against district population proportions of equity
populations and route/line proportions of equity populations.
Low-income status for population within the district is derived from Census Bureau population estimates and is
based on 150% of the United States federal poverty level (Department of Health and Human Services
guidelines), based on local context, which is an annual income of $32,580 for a family of three. Minority status
is based on the non-white and Hispanic or Latino count of total population. The service area is based on the
collection of block groups wholly or partially within district boundaries.
Route/line service area population is determined using a quarter mile “catchment area” centered around bus
stops and rail stations. This catchment area is then used to calculate the percentage overlap of block groupbased population underneath. For instance, if a catchment area contains 100% of the underlying block group,
100% of the population would be associated with the services within a quarter mile; if 50% of a block group
was contained in the catchment area, only half of the underlying population would count as being included
(ratios of population demographics would be unchanged).
RTD calculates the net change in service hours for each route/line proposal to provide the percent difference
from baseline service hours. Any change meeting or exceeding a 25% change (either positive or negative) from
baseline is flagged as a major service change for further review.

Public Outreach Overview

Three public meetings were conducted October 21-22, 2024. The comments collected on service changes during
these meetings are summarized in the table below. Table 1 captures the meeting locations, dates, number of
attendees and the common themes of attendees’ comments pertaining to the major service changes described
in this analysis.

The public was also notified of the ability to submit comments to service.change@rtd-denver.com, by phone at
303-299-6000 and at Board of Directors’ meetings. In 2024, RTD also added the option for the public to provide
comment by completing route- and line-specific surveys found at www.rtd-denver.com/service-alerts/servicechanges.
There was a total of 1,289 responses on the proposed service changes, with 65% indicating a very positive
impact and 20% indicating a somewhat positive impact. See below for route-specific feedback:
•

Route AB1: Received strong support with 87% finding it very positive and 11% somewhat positive

•

Route 35: Positive response with 72% very positive and 16% somewhat positive

•

Route 49: Mixed feedback with 40% very positive and 30% somewhat positive, but 10% very
negative

•

Route 83D: Generally well-received with 61% very positive and 28% somewhat positive

•

Route 100: Mixed reviews; 59% very positive, 18% somewhat positive, and a combined 18%
negative

•

Route 139: Predominantly positive at 60% somewhat positive, though 20% noted a very negative
impact

•

Route FF5: Mostly positive, with 41% very positive, 32% somewhat positive, and 12% negative

•

Route LD1: Highly favorable with 53% very positive and 36% somewhat positive, and minimal
negative feedback

Overall, the feedback reflects substantial support for the proposed changes, with a few areas where impacts
are more mixed.
Additionally, the Transit Equity Office collaborated with Community-Based Organizations (CBOs) to share
information on service changes and encourage customer feedback on the proposed changes to the routes.
Through this partnership, three CBOs attended a total of nine events, directly reaching 944 community members.

Major Service Change, Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden
Analyses

Proposed service changes for the January 2025 runboard that resulted in a 25% or greater change in service
were categorized by equity population (minority or non-minority, low-income or non-low-income) for

comparison. Routes were categorized as either equity or non-equity based on their identification within the prior
(current) network using 2018-2022 American Community Survey (ACS) five-year demographic data.
A comparative, proportional equity analysis was completed to review the routes/lines individually. This analysis
identified the equity and non-equity populations within a route/line service area and compared those against the
equity and non-equity populations of the district. If impacted equity populations within the route/line service
area received 10% or greater impacts compared to non-equity populations, the route/line had a potential finding
of Disparate Impact (for minority populations) or Disproportionate Burden (for low-income populations) and was
flagged for a potential finding of impact.

Changes by Transit Mode

For the January 2025 runboard, 22 fixed-route bus routes and three rail lines will undergo various service
changes. Of these, 12 routes will see combined increases in bus service of over 407 total weekday revenue
service hours and 541 additional weekend service hours.1 While not considered a major service change
under current policy, the proposal to merge portions of Routes 1 and 44 represents a significant change in
alignment and service patterns. Service increases on other routes include additional service frequencies and
spans of service (longer hours of service) on several routes both for weekday and weekend service.

Major Service Change Review

A complete listing of all service changes can be found in Appendix A. Changes were first reviewed in aggregate
equity groupings of routes/lines prior to individual review of routes/lines, route/line block groups and overall
network levels; equity grouping comparison occurred at every level. Major service changes are categorized as
the following:
•
•

Major Service Reductions (a service reduction of 25% or more)
Major Service Increases (service increases of 25% or more related to new or restructured service)

Major Service Change Reductions
There are no major service reductions proposed for the proposed January 2025 runboard.

1 The reinstatement of 15-minute frequency on the E and H Lines are not noted here as an increase in service hours given that their

baseline frequency prior to ongoing maintenance projects (notably, the Coping Panel project and Downtown Rail Reconstruction project
in 2024) was 15 minutes. Thus, there is no change in service hours.

Major Service Change Increases

Eight bus routes had proposed major service increases which include service increases of 25% or greater.
Improved headways and spans of service are proposed on Routes 49, 83D, 100, 139, AB1, FF5 and LD1 for the
January 2025 service change. The proposed segment reinstatement of the Route 35 is outlined in the RTD
Board approval of the System Optimization Plan (SOP).

Other Changes
While not currently included within major service change policies, the proposal to truncate Routes 1 and 44 at
Civic Center Station and combine those truncated segments into the new 1E/44 (Art District Connector) route
represents a significant change in alignment and service patterns. While the truncation may impact some
customers who previously rode through downtown to the respective route ends, data supporting the proposal
indicates potential improvements in trips for customers who formerly had to transfer to complete the new route
pattern as well as improved service to and through downtown Denver.

Route- and Line-Level Analysis
Having identified the service changes which meet the definition of Major Service Change, the next step in the
analysis is to look at each route/line individually to determine potential Disparate Impacts (DI) and/or
Disproportionate Burdens (DB). Both service reductions and service increases are analyzed. For service
increases, the analysis examines the extent to which the benefits of the improvements are inclusive of minority
and low-income populations. For service decreases, the analysis examines the extent to which the adverse
effects of the reductions are disproportionately borne by minority and low-income populations.

Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden Analysis
For each route/line with a major service change, determine the percent of the route’s/line’s
impacted equity and non-equity populations comprising the district’s equity and non-equity
populations; if the difference is greater than 10% for equity populations, additional review is
required for potential adverse impacts

In concert with RTD’s Title VI policies, the demographics of each of major service change routes were reviewed
for potential DI or DB findings. For service increases, the following analysis examines the extent to which the
benefits of the improvements are inclusive of minority and low-income populations. Because these are proposed
service increases, protected populations falling below these thresholds are flagged for potential concerns. The
narrative analysis of each individual line follows, which includes further considerations of access to jobs,
education, health care, food and social services for minority and low-income populations.

Route 35
Proposal: Segment reinstated east of Englewood Station to Nine Mile Station primarily along Hampden Avenue,
as described in the Systems Optimization Plan.
As shown in Table 3, a slightly higher percentage of the district’s low-income population stands to benefit from
the proposed major service increase as compared to the non-low-income population (0.98% vs. 0.79%,
respectively). This difference does not meet the 10% disproportionate burden threshold (0.71%). Therefore, no
potential route-level disproportionate burden is found. Additionally, a higher percentage of the district’s minority
population benefits from the proposed major service decrease as compared to the non-minority population
(1.10% vs. 0.65%, respectively). This difference does not meet the 10% disparate impact threshold (0.58%).
Thus, there is no potential disparate impact found at the route level requiring further examination (i.e., access
to key public service destinations, community engagement and network level analysis).

As shown in Table 7, a slightly lower percentage of the district’s low-income population stands to benefit from
the proposed major service increase as compared to the non-low-income population (0.77% vs. 0.95%,
respectively). This difference meets the 10% disproportionate burden threshold (0.85%). Therefore, a
potential route-level disproportionate burden is found. However, a higher percentage of the district’s
minority population benefits from the proposed major service increase as compared to the non-minority
population (1.02% vs. 0.84%, respectively). This difference does not meet the 10% disparate impact threshold
(0.76%). Thus, there is no potential disparate impact found at the route level requiring further examination (i.e.,
access to key public service destinations, community engagement and network level analysis).

Analysis of Minor Service Change
A route level analysis for minor service changes is atypical in RTD’s equity analyses but was performed to
understand the potential impacts to minority and low-income populations currently served by Routes 1 and 44
and to provide supplemental information for the January 2025 service change. Because of the truncation of
these routes prior to a merger and the potential for new transfers, proposals on the extent routes are considered
service decreases. The merged segments creating the 1E/44 (Art District Connector) is considered a service
increase. As with major service changes analyses, the demographics of each route were reviewed for potential
DI or DB findings.

Route 1
Proposal: As described in the SOP, service east of 17th/18th Streets truncated and rerouted to Civic Center Station
via Broadway/Lincoln. The new routing would serve the current alignment between Lakewood Commons and
17th/Stout
For the purposes of this analysis and as a conservative measure, this proposal is assumed as a service decrease
due to possibility of forced transfers at Civic Center Station. As shown in Table 11, a slightly higher percentage
of the district’s low-income population stands to be impacted from the proposed major service decrease as
compared to the non-low-income population (2.13% vs. 1.12%, respectively). This difference meets the 10%
disproportionate burden threshold (1.23%). Therefore, a potential route-level disproportionate burden is found.
Additionally, a higher percentage of the district’s minority population is impacted from the proposed major service
decrease as compared to the non-minority population (1.61% vs. 1.08%, respectively). This difference meets

For the purposes of this analysis and as a conservative measure, this proposal is assumed as a service decrease
due to possibility of forced transfers at Civic Center Station. As shown in Table 12, a slightly higher percentage
of the district’s low-income population stands to be impacted from the proposed major service decrease as

Additionally, a lower percentage of the district’s minority population stands to be impacted from the proposed
major service decrease as compared to the non-minority population (1.64% vs. 1.74%, respectively). This
difference meets the 10% disparate impact threshold (1.91%). Thus, there is no potential disparate impact

New 1E/44 Art District Connector Route
Proposal: Eastern portion of the Route 1 and Route 44 combined, connecting the Baker and Five Points
neighborhoods from Alameda Station to 40th/Colorado Station; the western portions of the Routes 1
(Lakewood Commons to Civic Center Station) and 44 (Wheatridge-Ward Station to Civic Center Station)
retained into downtown Denver, with the new merged routing renamed as the ART Connector, as described in
the RTD Board-approved Systems Optimization Plan. Under current policy, this change is not considered a
Major Service Change.
As shown in Table 13, a higher percentage of the district’s low-income population stands to benefit from the
proposed merger as compared to the non-low-income population (2.02% vs. 0.90%, respectively). This
difference does not meet the 10% disproportionate burden threshold (0.81%). Therefore, no potential routelevel disproportionate burden is found. Additionally, a higher percentage of the district’s minority population
benefits from the proposed merger as compared to the non-minority population (1.31% vs. 0.92%, respectively).
This difference does not meet the 10% disparate impact threshold (0.83%). Thus, there is no potential disparate
impact found at the route level requiring further examination (i.e., access to key public service destinations,
community engagement and network level analysis), and the creation of the 1E/44 helps maintain service
availability following the truncation of the Routes 1 and 44.

Systemwide Analysis

In accordance with RTD’s 2022 Title VI Program Update, a systemwide analysis is required in addition to routeand line-level analyses. A system level analysis provides further understanding of changes to service levels for
Title VI protected populations at aggregate levels.
The major service change threshold of 25% or greater used for individual route-level analyses was used as
precedent to determine potential adverse impacts overall and to identify structural issues in areas requiring
further review. Once average district thresholds for low-income and minority populations are established,
subsequent equity analyses focused on the subset of district block groups that experienced major service
changes of 25% or greater (additions or reductions in service), and whether equity block groups with major
service changes experienced service changes of 10% or more compared to non-equity block groups. Routes
with major service changes are later comparatively reviewed for potential adverse effects at route-block group
levels (block groups within route service areas).
The analysis of all service changes identified the following:
•
•

Systemwide, bus service increases by over 407 weekday revenue hours and 541 weekend hours
Of the nearly 320,000 people served by stops within the service area with major service changes, equity
populations represented a higher share of population compared to district averages. Of this total, over
55,000 people with low incomes and nearly 122,000 people in minority communities would receive service
improvements.

•

At the systemwide level, equity routes and non-equity routes2 were compared only for those with major
service changes. All bus routes serve higher than average low-income populations. Of the eight bus
routes with major service changes, three serve higher than average minority populations.

In review of the proposed major service changes at the systemwide level, there are no potential
disparate impact or disproportionate burden findings.
An analysis was conducted of all district block groups and their service levels to establish the baseline equity
thresholds for low-income and minority populations and to determine the systemwide magnitude of impacts of
the September 2024 to January 2025 service changes. Block groups with low-income and minority
populations at or above the district average are referred to in this analysis as “equity” block groups whereas
non-low-income and non-minority block groups are referred to as “non-equity” block groups.

Network Analysis Process
Determine block groups at/above district averages for low-income population (14.2%) and
minority population (37.5%).
Determine which block groups experienced service changes of 25% or more.
Of block groups with a major service change, compare the difference in population for equity
versus non-equity block groups; if the difference is more than 10%, review for potential
adverse impacts.

There are 2,197 block groups defined as being wholly within or mostly within the District.3 Using the 2018-2022
Five-Year ACS Estimates, total population residing within these block groups was calculated as well as the total
minority population and total low-income population, calculated separately, to determine the District-wide lowincome and minority rates which set the thresholds for which block groups are classified as above average.
While the percent minority figure of 37.5% was derived by using the base population of the service area (3.064
million), the low-income population percentage of 14.2% is derived from a slightly smaller population figure
(3.02 million). This is due to the smaller population whose poverty status the Census Bureau can determine.4
The thresholds summarized in Table 14 yielded 824 (37.5% of all) block groups above the district average for
low-income population, and 846 (38.5%) block groups above the district average for minority population.

The proposed major service changes were examined in aggregate by transit mode to determine overall impacts
to underlying population. Table 15 summarizes the change in service for total block group populations
2 Based on existence of the route within the May 2024 network and the population within a quarter mile of bus stops or rail stations.

2018-2022 Five-Year ACS estimates were used for population identification.
3 Some block groups are not completely contained within district boundaries due to differences in boundaries between the District and
Census-defined geographies.
4 The total population whose poverty status is determinable/assessed is lower than the estimate of total population due to the inability
of the Census to determine income for everyone estimated to reside in a particular block group.

underlying the bus stops with proposed major service increases (excluding the route merger) proportionally
compared to population in the District. There are no proposed major service decreases. The comparison reviews
the equity composition of those who may be impacted by proposed service changes compared to the overall
equity composition of the District overall.
No major service changes (longer than 12 months) were proposed for rail services with the January 2025
service change; changes to D, E and H Lines are temporary changes.

For system-level service increases (excluding population affected by the merger of Routes 1 and 44), minority
populations stand to benefit more than non-minority populations (10.61% vs. 10.32% respectively).
This difference does not meet the disparate impact threshold of 9.29%. Therefore, no system-level disparate
impact finding is found with the proposed major service increases. Low-income populations stand to
benefit more than non-low-income populations (12.8% vs. 9.89%, respectively). The difference does not
meet the 10% disproportionate burden threshold of 8.9%. Therefore, no system-level disproportionate burden
is found with the proposed major service increase.
Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the locations of above average low-income and minority block groups within the
District as well as highlight services with major service changes (orange). Compared to the District overall,
Routes 35, 49, 139 serve minority populations higher than the District average.

Summary of Findings
The systemwide service modifications proposed between September 2024 and January 2025 include
schedule improvements, expansions of service spans, alignment changes, and additional trips on regional routes.
Eight major service changes include those for Routes 35, 49, 83D, 100, 139, AB1, FF5, and LD1.
Route-level Findings:
•
•

•

•

•

•

Of the 27 total services with proposed changes, taken individually, 4 had potential DI or DB findings.
Route 100 has a potential disparate impact finding due to minority populations receiving 0.42%
less benefit than non-minority populations. Low-income populations receive 0.03% more benefit than
non-low-income populations.
Route 139 has a potential disproportionate burden finding due to low-income populations
receiving 0.18% less benefit than non-low-income populations. Minority populations receive 0.18% more
benefit than non-minority populations.
Route AB1 has a potential disparate impact finding due to minority populations receiving 0.39%
less benefit than non-minority populations. Low-income populations receive 1.09% more benefit than
non-low-income populations.
Route LD1 has a potential disparate impact finding due to minority populations receiving 0.21%
less benefit than non-minority populations. Low-income populations receive 0.05% more benefit than
non-low-income populations.
Additionally, while not considered major service changes, the truncation of the Route 1 impacts equity
(i.e., minority and low-income) populations more than non-equity (i.e., non-minority and non-lowincome) populations. Minority populations are impacted 0.53% more than non-minority populations.
Additionally, low-income populations are impacted 1.01% more than non-low-income populations.
Truncation of the Route 44 also has a potential disproportionate burden finding due to low-income
populations being impacted 1.0% more than non-low-income populations (whereas populations are
impacted 0.09% less than non-minority populations). On the other hand, the merger of segments from
Routes 1 and 44 into the 1E/44 Art District Connector had no potential findings and will maintain service
availability to the truncated portions of the Routes 1 and 44.

Table 16 summarizes major service changes by change type, provides findings of potential disparate impacts
and disproportionate burdens based on a comparative difference analysis, and it provides the individual route
service change.

Systemwide-level Findings:

Routes 35, 49, 83D, 100, 139, AB1, FF5, and LD1 comprise the January 2025 runboard’s major service
changes.
Almost 320,000 people live within a quarter mile of bus stops on routes with major service increases.
Both minority and low-income populations are represented at higher shares of the population than district
averages (38.2% and 17.7%, respectively). Low-income populations received a slightly higher
benefit (were more positively impacted) compared to non-low-income populations. Lowincome areas benefited 2.92% more compared to non-low-income areas. Minority populations
received a higher benefit (were more positively impacted) compared to non-minority
populations. Minority areas benefited 0.29% more compared to non-minority areas.

Next Steps for Potential Disparate Impacts and Disproportionate Burden Findings
Given a potential disparate impact or disproportionate burden, RTD will evaluate whether there is an alternative
that would serve the same objectives and with a more equitable impact. Otherwise, RTD will either:
a) Alter the service proposal to avoid, minimize, or mitigate potential disparate impacts/disproportionate
burdens, or
b) Provide a substantial legitimate justification for keeping the proposal as-is and show that there are no
alternatives that would have a less disparate impact on minority riders or disproportionate burden on
low-income customers but would still accomplish the project or program goals.
Title VI concerns are minimal with the proposed January 2025 service change proposal. Although three major
service changes resulted in a potential disparate impact and one major service change resulted in a
disproportionate burden at the route level, RTD recommends keeping the January 2025 service plan as proposed
as there are no practical alternatives to avoid, minimize or mitigate the disparate impacts and disproportionate
burden. As noted in the route-level findings, improving service on these routes (100, 139, AB1 and LD1) does
not raise concerns of inequitable distribution of benefits given the minimal differences (0.42%, 0.18%, 0.39%
and 0.21%, respectively) between the comparator groups.
Additionally, the network-level analysis provides holistic understanding of changes to service levels for Title VIprotected populations across the service area compared to the route level. The analysis revealed no network
level findings. In fact, both minority and low-income populations stand to benefit more at the network

level from the major service changes than non-minority and non-low-income populations. All eight
bus routes facing major service changes serve higher than average low-income populations, and three of the
routes serve higher than average minority populations with only three improvements (specifically, to the Routes
100, AB1 and LD1) serving areas with relatively low minority populations as compared to non-minority
populations.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
2024 GM/CEO Performance Appraisal and Related
Compensation Change

November 21, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
December 3, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) Debra A. Johnson’s attached
performance appraisal for the 2024 calendar year performance cycle, and in connection therewith, to
approve a 4.86 percentage increase to the GM/CEO’s current Annual Base Salary.
BOARD REPRESENTATIVE
Erik Davidson, Performance Committee Chair
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Performance Committee (PC) is responsible for oversight and management of the GM/CEO’s
employment contract, compensation package, and annual comprehensive performance appraisal.
Following the PC’s consideration, the GM/CEO’s performance appraisal and any corresponding incentive
and adjusted base compensation are reviewed and approved by the Board.
On September 20, 2020, RTD and the GM/CEO entered into a five-year employment agreement
(Agreement). The Agreement sets forth her compensation and benefits, as well as a program by which
the Board, in consultation with the GM/CEO, establishes performance goals and metrics, annually
evaluates her performance, and utilizes a framework for determining future incentive awards and
increases to base salary subject to her meeting or exceeding these goals. The Agreement has been
amended by the parties seven times, with the most recent amendment adopted by the Board on January
30, 2024. The Board adopted the 2024 GM/CEO Performance Assessment Framework on January 30,
2024.
On March 26, 2024, the Board approved a summary scope of work for consulting services related to the
development and execution of a total Compensation Study, 360° assessment instrument, and final
assessment tool and authorized the GM/CEO to enter into a contract for such services.
DISCUSSION
Consistent with the Third and Fourth Amendments to the Agreement, on October 18, 2024, GM/CEO
Johnson submitted a self-evaluation for the Board’s consideration. All Directors were provided the 360°
assessment results and given the opportunity to submit ratings and comments on the GM/CEO’s
performance during the performance period. The attached appraisal reflects the Board’s assessment that
GM/CEO Johnson meets expectations with respect to the 2024 Performance Assessment Framework.

Packet Pg. 233

17.E

This discussion aligns with the Strategic Priorities of Community Value, Customer Excellence, Employee
Ownership, and Financial Success, as the GM/CEO’s performance is reflective of the overall performance
of the agency as a whole.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
In accordance with the 2024 Performance Assessment Framework and as a result of the GM/CEO
Performance Appraisal score, the GM/CEO will receive a 4.86 percent merit increase, increasing her
Adjusted Base Salary from $402,325 to $421,878, effective January 1, 2025.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
January 2025 Service Change

November 13, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
December 3, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the January 2025 Service Change as revised and summarized in
Attachment A and to authorize the General Manager and CEO or her designee to execute contract
amendments as necessary for private operators impacted by the service changes.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Fred Worthen, Assistant General Manager, Bus Operations
Jessie Carter, Senior Manager, Service Development
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
In alignment with the service change and work shift process detailed in the Collective Bargaining
Agreement (CBA) shared between RTD and the Amalgamated Transit Union 1001 (ATU), the January
2025 service change process facilitates both an opportunity for bus and rail operators to select new
work assignments and for Service Development staff to adjust the operations plan for RTD’s transit
network.
DISCUSSION
Considering the current staffing levels and anticipated attrition, the January 2025 Service Change
recommendations were designed with careful consideration toward the availability of staff. The
recommendations are centered on continued System Optimization Plan (SOP) implementation, the
restoration of services and system capacity, and improving system performance and reliability by way of
service enhancements, reductions, and adjustments.
The January 2025 service change recommendation contains several SOP-related increases. Among the
more notable changes are:
•
A restructure and combination of segments on Routes 1, 1E/44, and 44
•
Increases to spans of service on Routes 24, and 73
•
Increases to service frequency on Routes 49, 105, and AB
•
Reinstatement of the eastern segment of Route 35 along Hampden Avenue
•
Reinstatement of 15-minute service on the E and H light rail lines, based upon progress achieved
in ongoing rail maintenance projects in the Southeast Corridor

Packet Pg. 237

18.F

Following RTD’s 2021-2026 Strategic Plan, relating most directly to Customer Excellence, and
recognizing the agency’s people power constraints, the proposals herein are directed at improving ontime performance, maintaining compliance with RTD’s CBA with ATU, and adjusting service levels to
match ridership demand.
The Board-adopted guidance for proposed service changes continues to be:
• Service performance evaluation based on RTD Service Standards
• The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit-dependent markets
• The availability of alternative services to affected riders
• Cost-effective distribution throughout the district and family of services, and the ability to enhance
service when possible
• Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also, there is no disparate impact on a minority population nor a disproportionate
burden on a low-income population
• Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
The service changes summarized below are further detailed in Attachment A.
The service changes with impacts from the SOP and full SOP are outlined in Attachment B.
Summary of Public Outreach
Between September 27 and October 31, 2024, staff reached out to the community via public meetings,
civic and non-profit organizations, and direct contact efforts at bus stops and rail stations. Additionally,
an updated feedback process was employed to collect customer input by impacted route or line. Written
communications, survey data, and public comments collected during this public comment period have
been summarized and listed in Attachment C of this report.
Revisions to Preliminary Modifications
Staff receives input during the public comment process and continues to conduct additional analysis
after the initial service modifications are communicated to the Board. Depending on the outcome of the
public comment process and continued analysis, staff may recommend additional revisions to these
initial modifications. The following modifications have been added or significantly revised:
Route 11 – Mississippi Crosstown – schedule adjustment affecting eastbound evening trip
Route NB – Boulder/Nederland/Eldora – schedule adjustment to better coordinate with bell times for
Boulder and Nederland schools
SERVICE CHANGE SUMMARY
SOP-Related Changes
The following recommended changes are reflective of service provision as contemplated in the SOP, the
comprehensive operational analysis of RTD’s transit network services adopted by the Board of Directors
on July 26, 2022, as a component of Reimagine RTD:

Bus Service

Route 1E/44 – Art District Connector
As described in the SOP as the 1/44E, eastern segments of the Route 1 and Route 44 combined
into a new route service, connecting the Baker and Five Points neighborhoods from Alameda
Station to 40th/Colorado Station, and thereby connecting the Santa Fe Arts District, the Denver
Theatre District and the RiNo Arts District, inspiring the route name. Western portions of the
Routes 1 (Lakewood Commons to Civic Center Station) and 44 (Wheat Ridge/Ward Station to
Civic Center Station) retained at current service levels.

RE: City of Boulder Comments on Proposed January 2025 Service Changes and Boulder Junction
Reopening
October 31, 2024
RTD Board of Directors
Debra A. Johnson, General Manager and Chief Executive Officer
Regional Transportation District
1660 Blake Street
Denver, CO 80202
Dear RTD Board Chairperson Davidson and General Manager Johnson,
The City of Boulder appreciates our long-standing partnership with RTD in supporting and
advancing regional and local transit services. We are encouraged by the latest trends in
ridership return after the pandemic and RTD’s growing operator workforce that is allowing the
addition of bus service in January 2025 as subscribed by the System Optimization Plan (SOP).
The proposed January 2025 service additions will greatly improve mobility options for travelers
throughout the Denver metro area, including University of Colorado students, Denver
International Airport employees and travelers, Anshutz Medical Center essential workers and
visitors, and many others traveling within and to and from Boulder.

Attachment: January 2025 Attachment C (5028 : January 2025 Service Change)

City of Boulder
City Council

In addition to supporting these expanded service offerings, the city seeks to reiterate through
this public comment period the critical need to return bus service at Boulder Junction. As
context, the city and RTD financially partnered on the development of the Boulder Junction
Depot Station which opened in 2015 and features an underground passenger lobby, six (6) bus
bays, public restrooms, and a customer service kiosk in a car-light district. Concerted efforts

Before the pandemic, six (6) RTD bus routes connected at Boulder Junction Depot Station, yet
service at Boulder Junction has been suspended since the implementation of the RTD COVID19 Service Plan in April 2020. The SOP calls for the restoration of Flatiron Flyer and AB
Airport/Boulder services, critical regional routes that allow workers, students, and visitors from
across the metro area to rapidly travel between Denver Civic Center Station, the US-36
corridor, DIA, and Boulder Junction. We are requesting a plan and timeline for the return of
bus service at and the reopening of Boulder Junction, and we are interested in partnering,
including with a potential city HOP route realignment to the station, to help make this a
success. A schedule for service return and the station’s reopening would greatly help address
community questions, preserve and build ridership demand, and further bolster community
support for RTD. We hope this can be accomplished quickly.
Thank you for your consideration, and please feel free to contact me to further discuss.
Sincerely,

Aaron Brockett
Mayor

Dear Chair Davidson,

Attachment: January 2025 Attachment C (5028 : January 2025 Service Change)

RE: January 2025 Proposed RTD Service Changes

The City and County of Broomfield is pleased to express its support for the proposed January service changes that improve service delivery on
the AB1, LD1, FF5, North Broomfield FlexRide (NBFX), and Interlocken/Westmoor Flexride (ILFX).
The AB1 is a very important RTD service among Broomfield residents. Broomfield staff frequently hear about capacity issues and limited
service hours. Reinstating a 30-minute frequency in the mornings and evenings on weekdays, Saturdays, and Sundays/holidays, along with
later service hours on weekdays, would be greatly appreciated by RTD customers in Broomfield.

The LD3 service currently operates with a one-hour frequency between Longmont and Broomfield, requiring a transfer at Broomfield Station
to access Denver Union Station, making it a less viable option for local and regional travel. We therefore strongly support the proposed
addition of two morning and two evening trips on the LD1 for one-seat trips between Longmont and Denver and encourage RTD to continue to
increase the overall frequency and convenience on this important regional connector.
Furthermore, Broomfield commends RTD’s efforts to phase in the restoration of services on the Flatiron Flyer, a critical link between
communities in the Northwest Denver Metro Region. The proposed additional FF5 trips would support commuters, students, and residents
needing to access medical services at Anschutz.

Broomfield has a growing population of residents within vulnerable demographic groups who need transportation options that are safe,
reliable, and affordable. The North Broomfield and Interlocken/Westmoor FlexRide services address this need by providing a convenient and
affordable mode of transportation that can be used to access medical appointments, grocery stores, and community resources. As such, we
strongly support the proposed service boundary expansion of the North Broomfield FlexRide that will increase resident’s access to the larger
community. This expansion may also help alleviate the high rate of denials on the Broomfield FlexRide, which is currently one in four.
Broomfield kindly requests that RTD consider expanding the proposed North Broomfield service boundary to include the Broomfield Civic
Campus so that north Broomfield residents can access community resources, including the Broomfield Community Center for wellness
activities and affordable meals, Senior Services, Library, Motor Vehicle, Workforce Center and Health and Human Services. Broomfield also
appreciates and strongly supports the proposed service boundary adjustment of the Interlocken/Westmoor FlexRide to include recently
constructed income-aligned housing and the larger Via Varra neighborhood, thereby improving access for these residents to shopping and
employment opportunities.

Lastly, Broomfield continues to encourage RTD to support the impacted riders of the suspended Route 128 by expanding the operational
capacity of the Broomfield Flexride. It also remains a top priority to restore Broomfield's transit access to Wagon Road Park-and-Ride and the
Eastlake and 124th N-Line Station with convenient and reliable options. Broomfield looks forward to continuing to partner with RTD to
optimize service, operations, and connections to regional transit facilities.

In summary, the proposed service changes are needed and appreciated investments to restore access to transit in Broomfield, which has been
significantly reduced since April 2020, to support community needs for transit options for all ages, abilities, and incomes. By supporting our
residents and expanding regional access, we are ensuring that the Broomfield community and the Denver metro region remain strong,
vibrant, and inclusive. Broomfield commends RTD for the proposed service changes and urges RTD to move forward with these proposals.
Sincerely,

Guyleen Castriotta, Mayor of the City & County of Broomfield

Dear RTD Staff:

First, we are pleased to see expanded service for the AB (SkyRide) bus, one of the most popular
RTD bus routes and one that is consistently experiencing standing-room-only service. We also
appreciate the increased service on routes 205, 208, and NB recognizing the increased ridership
of Boulder and Nederland High School students thanks to Zero Fare for Youth.
The service increase for the well-used FF5 route from downtown Boulder to Anschutz is also
very impactful, as this offers riders an important regional connection. We would similarly like to
see additional service added to the popular FF2 express route between downtown Boulder and
Denver Union Station, as we have received numerous requests for additional regional express
service from employees in both Boulder and Denver.
Second, we remain concerned about the lack of service to Boulder Junction. While commuter
behavior has changed since 2020, Boulder Junction has continued to grow, with more than 25
businesses now in the district, as well as 2,000 residents and 2,400 employees with diverse
needs and incomes, all of whom have access to free EcoPasses. Boulder Junction and its RTD
station have the potential to serve as a vibrant model for the rest of the state following the
passage of HB24-1313, but until reasonable transit service is restored to the station, other
communities that are considering investing in dense, mixed-used TOD’s such as Boulder
Junction, are understandably very reluctant and concerned to do so without assurances that
reliable and regular transit service will be in place for residents and employees in these areas.
RTD’s System Optimization Plan (SOP) clearly shows the demand for transit to Boulder Junction
as part of the Core, Connect, and Commute Routes. The SOP, in particular, calls out the demand
for AB (SkyRide) service to and from Boulder Junction. Our team is also currently conducting a
transit demand assessment survey in the Boulder Junction neighborhood, and we look forward
to sharing the results with RTD staff later this year. We hope that the results of this survey can
be taken into account for RTD’s May 2025 service changes.
Third, the service changes indicate a resumption of AB2 service to Denver International Airport,
but currently call for this service to start in downtown Boulder and travel down Canyon and 28 th
Street. We would like to see RTD explore ways to allow Boulder Junction residents and workers
to board the AB2 in the Boulder Junction neighborhood. The Park-n-Ride at Boulder Junction
also makes this a very practical and convenient location for residents from Gunbarrel, Niwot and
Longmont who are seeking faster and more direct AB bus service to the airport.

Attachment: January 2025 Attachment C (5028 : January 2025 Service Change)

We at Boulder Chamber Transportation Connections write to share our comments on the RTD’s
proposed January 2025 service changes.

We thank RTD for considering our comments and addressing so many vital transit needs in our
region.
Sincerely,

Karen Worminghaus

Brandon Figliolino 0:10

Excellent. Alright. So good afternoon everybody.
I'm the manager of community engagement here at the Regional Transportation
district and I am joined today by my colleague Dan Merritt.

He is our senior service planner and scheduler on the service planning and

development team. We're going to be presenting to you today our proposed service
changes for January 2025.

We also have some other RTD team members on this call to answer any.

Specific questions about the route patterns and things like that as we go along, I do
ask that you remain on mute until the question and answer period.

That way we can get through the proposed changes and then have more of a
discussion about them at the end.
Oh, right.

So for today's presentation, I'm going to give you an overview of what service

changes entail and kind of the process that we go through to make these changes.
We'll go through the specific proposed changes for January.

Will tell you how you can provide your input, and you'll also be able to provide input
to us today, and then we will finish by talking about the timeline and next steps for
implementation and adoption.
So what are service changes?

Service changes are modifications to RT vs bus and rail system that happen generally
3 * a year in January, May and September.

Attachment: January 2025 Attachment C (5028 : January 2025 Service Change)

My name is Brandon Figliolino.

These are changes that are done for a variety of reasons, including increasing our
reliability, improving our on time performance, enabling our representative

workforce to select shifts accounts for changes in ridership ridership, whether that be
an increase in ridership or a decrease.

It also is helping us advance our system optimization plan, which is our five year plan
for bringing service and optimizing it to the confines of our realities with post

Packet Pg. 262

18.F.c

pandemic and people power and all of that.

We also have these changes to support our maintenance projects that are scheduled.
So we have 5 categories of service changes and I wanna outline them briefly for you.
So that way they're clear, the first one is route adjustments.

These can be temporary or permanent changes or detours to a particular route, or
stop to optimize the efficiency of the route, improve accessibility, respond to
changing travel patterns, or facilitate maintenance projects.

Has quite a few route adjustments that are geared towards our system optimization

plan and really making sure that the routes we're running are going to be as efficient
as possible.

Service increases. These are changes that either increase the frequency, the number

of trips, the span of service, or the operating hours for a particular rail line or a bus
route.

Really excited to stay that we have quite a few service increases proposed for January
2025. A service reduction is the opposite of a service increase.

That's where we're contracting and reducing the frequency or the number of trips or
span or service or operating hours on our bus or rail lines.

I'm happy to say that we have 0 service reductions for the proposed January service
change.

Then we also have seasonal adjustments.

These are temporary adjustments made to bus and rail service in response to
seasonal variations, so think of.

Tripper service. When we have school in session, we'll have a few more buses
running.

Because there are more students on the buses. But in the summer when school and
university are out of session, we don't necessarily need those extra buses running.

That would be a seasonal adjustment and then the last service change is a schedule

Attachment: January 2025 Attachment C (5028 : January 2025 Service Change)

In this proposed January service change.

timing adjustment.

These are very small adjustments to the running time of our bus or rail network and
they help us to better align connections between different buses and rail routes,
improve our on time performance.

And align with customer demands.
Reschedule timings are very small.

They're generally a minute or two difference.

Packet Pg. 263

18.F.c

It's not adding a service or increasing the frequency, it's just modifying the times at
which they arrive at different points on the route.

And so with that, I'm going to pass it off to my colleague Dan Merritt, and he's going
to go through the proposed service changes for 2025.
Dan Merritt 5:05

Thank you, Brandon.
We are making many changes here for the upcoming January 2025 service change.

We'll start off with our rail and proposed service increases. We proposed to enhance
reliability and reduce wait times to better meet the needs of our customers by
reinstating a 15 minute service frequency on.

Both the E line, which runs from Denver Union Station to Ridgecote station.
And the H line, which runs from 18th and California station.
To the Florida station. Next slide please.

We also have many changes proposed for bus side.

We are looking at making changes and creating a route which is which is referred to
in the system optimization plan as the one E 44 which we're calling the art District
connector.

You also just for reference here the S the system optimization plan referred to as the
SOP. During this meeting, both names are synonymous.
We also are looking at some changes to Route 24.

Route 35, Route 49, Route 73, Route 83 D, Route 100, Route 139, the A BS1 and two
the FF5 and the LD.
Next slide please.

We also are looking making some changes to adjust some schedule timing.

These are where we're not changing the routing on some routes, just changing the
time to improve on time performance. As Brandon explained previously.

Attachment: January 2025 Attachment C (5028 : January 2025 Service Change)

OK, as he said.

The route one is going through that and it's new iteration. The 1 E 44 will be going
through some changes as it gets set up throughout 15 throughout 2435.
4245 and 44.

Sorry, Skip 44 there. Next slide please.

We're also making the same changes or similar changes to routes 5265737683 D the
101, thirty nine, and the LD.
Next slide please.

Packet Pg. 264

18.F.c

We'll also be making some timing changes on rail side.
These will be to the D line, the E line and the H line.
OK. Going over our changes.

For route one, we are going to be shortening the route to terminate at Civic Center
station, so it'll be the West side of route one. Previously all the way through
downtown and it will be ended at Civic Center station. Next slide.

Throughout 44, we'll be going through a similar change. Where is the West side of
Next slide please. The 1 E 44, also called the Art District Connector will be taking the

eastern halves of both those previous routes, the one and the 44 and stitching them

Alameda station.

Go through Baker District through downtown, and then continuing out east all the
way to.

That is 40th and Colorado station that it will be terminating at.
Next slide please.

The 35 will be reinstating the Englewood station to 9 miles station segment.
Next slide please.

2015 will be updating routing to reflect an ongoing detour and that is east of
Himalaya through Piccadilly.
Next slide please.

The 45 will be updating routing also to reflect an ongoing detour.

Westbound buses will operate in a loop via Maxwell, taking a right on Dunkirk, right
turn on 56th Ave. and a third right turn on Ireland.
Buses will serve the same stops in both directions.
I'm always going clockwise, it sounds like.

We also have an update to the interlocking Westmore Flex ride.

We'll be expanding the boundaries, which will include a new affordable housing

development which will improve transportation options for lower income residents
and in higher enhance ridership.
It's hard.

We also be making adjustments to the North Broomfield Flex ride, also expanding
boundaries to provide enhanced flex ride connections for residents of North

Broomfield and add multiple key travel destinations that were previously inaccessible
via the North Broomfield Flex Ride service.

service development and just want to add 2 quick things on the AB.

The AB two you probably saw the name downtown Boulder station through DEN to
Denver. The AB2 pattern previously ran out of Boulder Junction, however.
Boulder Junction will not reopen yet.

Instead, we will start operating AB2 trips from Downtown Boulder station.

Via Canyon, 28th St. Tabernacle and then the regular routing to come the airport.
Also, quick update on the NB as we're going through the process for January

recommended changes we received quite a bit of input regarding the recent NB
route changes and had to occur in September in order for us to adhere to the
collective bargaining agreement with the Union.

We've taken that input and we're looking to recommend additional changes on
Route NB that will then better match the Bell start and end times.

Older high school and KC Middle School, as well as some of the other times that

might be of purpose for NB route writers.

That now I'll pass it to Brandon. Thank you.
Brandon Figliolino 11:40

Is someone from the East team able to speak to the 15 L and Piccadilly?
Maux Sullivan 16:19

Attachment: January 2025 Attachment C (5028 : January 2025 Service Change)

Sorry.

Yes, hi Brandon.

This is Moe Sullivan.

I'm a senior service planner and scheduler for our E team and thanks for your
feedback Jayden.

So right now, unfortunately, we're not able to serve the stop at 13th Ave. and Lisbon
with any bus because there's not a Safeway for our buses to get back onto Colfax

Packet Pg. 268

18.F.c

because there's not a signal currently. So unfortunately, due to safety reasons, we're
not able to.

Jaden Stoll 16:40
Alright.

Oh, OK.

Do any routing there?

There is a signal coming.

So hopefully within the year we can route to that stop and provide that service, but
until then, we have to update our maps to reflect the current detour because it's
causing quite a bit of confusion for customers and frustration for our operators.
Jaden Stoll 16:59
OK.
Oh.

OK.

Wait, wait, are you guys changing the route 66?

Is that gonna affect like access rides for like throughout 66 if you change if you
change the the access right boundaries is it gonna affect me?

Because I use excess rods, eventually my like day program which I'm at now.

Oh, is that gonna affect me?
Maux Sullivan 17:37

So the 15 change will not impact the flex, the accessor right boundaries.
I don't know.

Attachment: January 2025 Attachment C (5028 : January 2025 Service Change)

Maux Sullivan 16:46

Jaden Stoll 17:44

Jaden Stoll 17:50
Thank you.

Maux Sullivan 17:51
Thank you.

Thank you.

Jayden, does anyone else have any questions or comments?
It's just another second. Ponder it.

And also just remember you also have plenty of other opportunities to provide your
comment with the survey customer care, the e-mail. So we want to hear from you

even if you don't want to talk to me today, you can still reach out to us at any time.
All right. So let's talk about the next steps.

Right now, RTD is undergoing an extensive public engagement process for service

changes and we are accepting comments and feedback through October 31st. After

that point, all of the comments that we've received will be compiled and shared with
the Board of Directors, Operations, Safety and Security Committee and.
We will take all of that feedback and work to incorporate it into.
Our planning documents for the proposed changes in January.

Once we have incorporated feedback and gotten a presentation out to the operation
safety and Security Committee, then it will go to full board of approval Board of

directors approval rather on December 3rd. And if it is approved and ratified, the
service changes would go into effect on January.
19th.

Karen, you've got a question.

Attachment: January 2025 Attachment C (5028 : January 2025 Service Change)

Brandon Figliolino 17:53

Karen Worminghaus 19:31
I just.

Hi, it's Karen. I just had a question, Natalie. Thanks.
I just got the AB2 map that you sent.

I'm reviewing it right now, but just out of curiosity, is is it slated to stop at the street
level at Boulder Junction?

Packet Pg. 270

18.F.c

I'm like sort of in real time trying to review them that map or does it bypass bulb
Egyptian completely?

Nataly Handlos 19:53

Now, so we still have the information folder junction for the AB2 on there because

for the SOP it is supposed to come back for folder junk junction when it opens and
so we will not delete it from there.

starting the AB2 at Downtown Boulder station.

Come down Canyon to 28th St. and 28th St. down to your 36th and Table Mesa and
then 36 to 470 to get to the airport.
Karen Worminghaus 20:20

OK, I'll I'll take a I'll take a closer look at the map and then thanks for thanks for that
clarification.

One quick question though.

I know because I think, at least in the summer, the business and I know the flex both
stop at the like on street at Boulder Junction.

Is that something that RTD had looked at or could that be a possibility so that the

station wouldn't have to get open, but if the bus could just stop basically the same
place that the flex stops? If that was looked at?
Nataly Handlos 20:45

If we were to start our end trips at that location on street, we do not have a turn
around or layover recovery.

We would have to either dead head to the garage or dead head to downtown
Boulder station anyway.

That is pretty significant as it comes to additional running times and resources that

Attachment: January 2025 Attachment C (5028 : January 2025 Service Change)

It's a little bit confusing when you look at the map of what we're proposing is

would be needed. Therefore, it makes most sense to operate out of downtown
Boulder station where all the other AB one trips operates start.
Karen Worminghaus 20:57
OK.
OK.

Packet Pg. 271

18.F.c

Nataly Handlos 21:11

End allows for more flexibility, more efficient inter lines between the AB and other
regional routes.

So starting it at Downtown Boulder station versus on streets.
Karen Worminghaus 21:19
Replay.
Nataly Handlos 21:24
It's yeah.

Karen Worminghaus 21:24
OK.

Thanks. Thanks for.

That way we can instead of wasting the resources in Deadhead or you know where
the past just runs between that stop and the garage or then back to downtown
Boulder station. We can take those times and resources and put them into the
schedule so that it becomes EFF.

go to rtd-denver.com, they've got a tile on the the main page where you can click
service changes and see a whole list of all the proposed changes in greater detail.
So you can identify, OK.

This one is a service increase of XYZ or ABC.
With that, I will close the public meeting.

Thank you all so much for your time and we will be taking this public meeting and
uploading it to the website for those individuals who are unable to attend today.

Oh, and Mo just dropped the web page in the chat, so be sure to click on that before.

Yes please!
The AB is always standing room only by the time it stops at Flatiron—increased frequency will alleviate this issue!
It would also be excellent to add a Boulder -> DEN bus between the 3am and 5am that currently exist. The 3am
bus is always packed!
We love increased frequency and reliability!
Please continue to increase service frequency of AB1 ! This is my preferred way to the DEN airport, and it's nearly
always full. Several times are standing room only. Adding more runs every 30 minutes, and later into the night, will
be fantastic and I will not have to worry if the bus is too full for me to ride to DEN!

Current service between Table Mesa ParkNRide to Denver Airport is not adequate. Regularly, people have to
stand in the aisle for the duration of the trip because of overcrowding, or are not allowed to ride at all. As much as
I love the AB route, the uncertainty of whether there will be space available is a real concern when planning travel
by public transport.
Additionally, service slightly later into the night would help immensely with those of us who fly back and forth to
the West Coast. I often have no RTD option available to me when arriving after 11PM (accounting for 20 min to
get from airport gate to bus), meaning I must take an Uber or Lyft all the way back to Boulder. It is expensive, and
dis-incentivizes the use of public transportation. 1 more late-night bus option (12:20a) would be amazingly helpful
for those of us coming in slightly later. The airport is quite busy still at this hour, so I am sure many are in my
situation.
Ridership from Denver airport to Boulder during the 4:00pm-7:00pm timeframe on weekdays has increased
significantly. I have been on the 4:20pm and 5:20pm buses from the airport several times in recent weeks that
necessitated standing in the aisle because all seats were full. Several people were turned away and had to wait
an hour for the next bus. RTD should NOT WAIT until January 2025 to add another bus between the 4:20pm and
6:15pm bus departures. It is needed now!
I wish there was a bus running parallel to foothills so I could get to valmont and foothills without needing a lift
service or friend/family to get the rest of the way home. Currently it would take me just as long to take a bus
around the city to get to valmont as it does to get from the airport to Boulder (going into the Boulder stations
doesn’t help reduce the time)
I wish the airport bus went later at night because my flights often get in then especially if they are delayed
The increased service hopefully will help with the bus being full many times at the via Varra stops. I’ve had to
stand on the bus the past 5 times due to the bus being full.
Improving frequency is a very good change. Previously the service was not good, the buses were frequently full
and would refuse to let customers on, which is unacceptable for a route that directly serves the airport.
Late-night bus services will greatly increase flexibility in terms of being able to take later (and often substantially
cheaper) flights and not needing to have a back-up plan in case of delayed flights.
I relied on the AB1 to get to the airport extensively when living in Boulder, but I now live in Longmont which the
route doesn’t serve. In addition to AB1/2, having a new airport bus route that serves Longmont would be an
excellent addition to RTD services
This will greatly improve my experience with the airport bus service. I will be more likely to take the bus when I
have very early or very late flights or have significant delays whereas I could not currently.
Every time we take the AB1 we say to ourselves, if only this bus ran more frequently! There's always a guessing
game: do we want to be an hour too early or cut it close. The proposed timing makes much more sense, and will
help with holiday traffic loads as well.

My family had stopped taking the AB buses in the last year, especially during peak travel times, due to buses
being full and passing by our stop or the timing being so long as to require us being at the airport hours in
advance.

Please make it happen. Anything to increase frequency because It seems like there are always people standing
on bus in either direction

Last year the Saturday after thanksgiving was so busy that i took airport to union station to boulder via the Flatiron
flyer. It was ok using the alternate route since most people were opting to wait for the AB1 but it would be great to
increase service if possible on those days around the holidays. I'm sure its hard to staff appropriately with staff
also wishing to enjoy holiday time off.
Many of us use RTD for our travel, this helps the commuters.
Love it! As a frequent user of this service to get from the airport to Flatiron Station/Broomfield stop, it would be
great to have increased service times. If it means a slight increase in fees that would be acceptable as well.
AB buses frequently fill up but are our favorite way to get to/from DIA!
Yay!
This should have happened a long time ago.
I ride the AB route frequently, and almost every time 8 or more people have been required to stand for at least 35
minutes of the route. I also would appreciate more frequency, as I have had to get to the airport over 45 minutes
early, or wait 45 minutes for a bus to depart from the airport.
As an airline employee riding AB bus at least 12 times a month, I appreciate the good service. However by the
time the bus gets to the Flatiron stop in Broomfield, it is almost entirely packed and many times standing room
only. This bus route is probably the most utilized in the entire RTD system. 30 minute service all day is necessary.
Charge more for this incredible service to pay for the airport. Make sure Broomfield residents can get a seat.
Perhaps paid reservation system would help
The current AB1 route eastbound is frequently full. This line needs to come at least 2 times per hour to meet
customer demands. There are many times I have waited for this bus only to be told by the driver he or she can
not accept any more passengers because the bus is full. Additionally the service leaving the airport at night has
been sporadic especially during the holidays where the bus is late traveling westbound or does not show at all.
This line badly needs additional buses traveling in both directions.
Excellent! We always have a backup plan should the bus be full. Can’t wait another hour. Thank you!!’
Why the Route AB1 does not stop in Longmont to pick up or drop off passengers.
More frequent service at times would be great.
The ridership on this route is consistently high. I believe even with increased frequency the buses will be full.
Thanks

Stopped using AB because of the lowered frequency (less convenient, more crowded, etc) Increased service
would make me consider it again
about time
This bus is very crowded, and it's better than parking at the airport! I hate getting in after the last bus, this will
save me time and money!
Airport service needs to be perfect. You can't strand people for no reason. It has to be sufficient for demand, all
the time.
Morning and afternoon buses, especially on weekends and holidays are often full or standing room only. 30min
intervals would improve this. Also, with many flights landing between 10-11p, a late bus is needed to
accommodate these travel itineraries
I’ve been on the bus when people have been turned away. I think it is a good idea to add buses. When I go to the
airport, I need to use the bus. I can’t afford a taxi there.
Since the AB1 route schedule was changed to limited hours and only running on the hour, my wife and I have
experienced packed buses (having to ride standing - no seat available) and very professional but overworked
drivers. The fares have always been an excellent value and the RTD app has made purchasing tickets easier and
convenient. But the buses need to run more often (every 1/2 hour) and they need to run earlier and later to cover
expanded airline schedules at DIA.
run them even later!
Please extend DIA to Boulder times past midnight to enable passengers from end of day flights arriving 11pm to
Midnight or so to make it to destinations. Thank you.
I regularly fly from the Seattle to Denver. Often, due to the hour gained, I end up arriving in Denver after 11:30pm
and missing the final bus from DIA to Boulder. Because of that, I have had to spent nights sleeping in DIA waiting
for the 5am bus. Have you ever been woken up to a rider vacuum cleaner riding towards your face? Well I have.
It's the stuff of nightmares. And sure, every time they turn at the last minute avoiding a collision. But like, what if
they didn't? Would I be the first fatality in a freak riding vacuum cleaner accident? Would they have to pick pieces
of me out of the spinning circular bristle pads? That could take hours! Thankfully, if there were a single later bus
than the 11:20pm bus, no one would be doomed to this potential fate. For those reasons, I highly encourage the
team at RTD to expand the hours of operation for this route. Thank you for your time!
We use this bus whenever we travel and having more options instead of every hour will be great as sometimes
the bus is full!
Happy to see the increase in times for this bus. Also wanted to communicate yet again that you need to bring
back the FF bus that provides service along the 36 corridor to the Civic Center station. Please please please!!

Attachment: Proposed January 2025 Service Change Survey Results 11.4.24 (5028 : January 2025 Service Change)

We pick up this bus at Flatiron Station and it is almost always full, with people standing the entire ride. Additional
routes would be very welcome and alleviate some stress about if we'll be able to fit on the bus to catch our flight.

The bus from Boulder to DIA is so often full, so THANK YOU for adding more frequent service!

Excited for this change. Buses have been crowded and 30 minutes frequency would be appreciated.

I rely on the AB Skyride to get me to and from DIA. It is often quite crowded and there are times when a
significant number of passengers have to stand. I am 81 years old and would really really like to be confident that
I will have a seat for the ride to DIA.
Past midnight trips should be Westbound (Denver to Boulder) to better align with flight schedules; there are many
flights that arrive just before midnight and no flights that leave a couple hours after midnight.
Much needed, especially for trips from the airport. Often crowded
Increased frequency of AB1 trips would make a huge difference! I travel often and always ride this route, and over
the last 6 months or so it has been excessively crowded—standing room only in both directions. More flexibility in
the schedule would be a huge benefit too, and later service from DEN alleviates having to scramble through the
airport to not miss the last bus of the night.
This neeeds to happen! AB1 buses from the airport (and to the airport) are frequently packed to the point where
people sometimes have to wait for the next one, which is an hour+ wait sometimes! :'(
When are you going to restart the FF6 and reopen Boulder-Junction station? You're turning our TOD housing
project into a transit desert! Stop running RTD like it's suburban car infrastructure, and start running it like a
service for people who dont want cars!
This is great, but I would think we'd want the post-midnight trips to be *from* the airport.
I recently took AB1 from DIA on a Sunday. Plane got held up at the gate for 15 minutes, and I missed the bus by
less than 5.
I had to wait 50 minutes for the next one. 20 minutes would have been very acceptable.
I wish the service ran in 30min intervals all the time. I frequently see buses fill up in the afternoons and that is
when I travel most, not morning or evening.
Airport bus service every half hour is extremely helpful, both from a timing and capacity perspective. This is a
popular line and is often quite busy, and when it only runs every hour you frequently just miss it and have to wait
awhile, or you have to arrive almost 3 hours early for a flight. Thanks RTD for considering expanded service on
this line!
This would increase ridership and align better with daily flights out of DEN.
Hooray! 30 minute Frequency will make it considerably more likely that I’ll use the bus instead of driving to the
airport

Attachment: Proposed January 2025 Service Change Survey Results 11.4.24 (5028 : January 2025 Service Change)

This bus is very much in need of increased service at all times of day and night.

Please do this. The bus is so crowded, with people standing nearly every time I take the AB1. Thank you!

This bus has to run well, otherwise we run the risk of clogging the already overloaded highways of Denver with
more passenger vehicles. I don't really understand the past-midnight East bound change - I think a past-midnight
Westbound increase makes more sense for later flight arrivals.
I often take flights (5 times a year?) that get back just after the last bus, the midnight bus is going to be awesome.
Service frequency should be 30 minutes for most of the day, not just rush hour. Right now there are only about
five busses on the 30 minute interval, but flights go in and out all day. Past midnight is needed for DEN to Boulder
but not the reverse. And an additional bus between the 3:04 and 4:34 bus from Boulder to DEN would be helpful.
One time I had to drive to the airport because the 4:34 bus would have been too late, but 3:04 is way too early.
Additional service during the end of holiday weekends would be a huge help!
Improved frequency and late hours will help to make the bus an easier choice. The drive through Flatiron P&R is
such a terrible experience. The road is not up to standards for heavy buses with lots of tipping, potholes and a
jarring ride. Could you improve the road or move the stop? That part of the trip is such a waste of time for a
couple riders. Maybe a small shuttle could take those riders to a stop on the toll road? Or create a bus only exit to
the flatiron p&r.
This is very much needed. I just waited 50 minutes for the AB bus. Of course there are people that are forced to
stand.
Increased frequency is great! I'd love to see it increased even more to 15 minutes, this would make it even easier
to plan around.
Please re-open Boulder Junction station and re-start service from there. That area is very poorly served by public
transit, and I would be able to use RTD transit much easier if it was open.
Always need later bus coming home from the airport
Would love a more frequent bus from and to the airport. I love the AB1 and use it every time I am trying to get to
the airport.
Fewer times of missing the bus at the airport by a few minutes, leading to an hour wait for the next. Less stress
about getting stuck at the airport trying to make the last bus to Boulder.
I don’t understand, however, why the latest bus is going from Boulder to the airport. Surely you’d want to prioritize
the other way round??
Increased and particularly later service would be very beneficial for me.

Attachment: Proposed January 2025 Service Change Survey Results 11.4.24 (5028 : January 2025 Service Change)

I have had to use other services like Uber and cabs to and from the airport last several years because there just
wasn't a bus to get me there on time. That makes me sad because I believe in public transportation (it's better for
the planet than uber)

Buses are often very crowded with no seats
Increased service increases my likelihood of using the bus.

There is really no other good way to access the airport. But getting in late or trying to align flights to bus
schedules is pretty bad.
For flights arriving late at night, the last bus is too early and 1hr frequency is too sparse. For example, if landing at
9:30pm, the 9:40pm bus is impossible to catch, but one could be home before the next bus is scheduled to leave
at 10:40pm by driving a car. Increasing frequency in the evening and morning and scheduling a later bus will help.
The more service to and from the airport, the better.
Would prefer this to be at 30 minute intervals all open hours. Would also benefit from the hours ending at 2 am
each way.
The AB1 bus is the most useful bus in the Boulder Area. I would vote to expand hours into the later
evening/morning hours to help with flights that get in past 12am.
I am always afraid I won’t get a seat on the bus because it is always so full. It would make a huge difference in
planning for my trips and getting home in a reasonable amount of time instead of waiting for up to an hour in
between busses. This is a great addition and many will be thankful for it!
This is a very popular route. It’s frequently standing room only. Please increase the frequency!
We need more AB frequency and buses in general but especially around high travel times like the holidays. Have
had to stand or miss bus regularly.
Would even support more frequent service times
This would make me much more inclined to use public transportation over a personal vehicle. It would also save
me money in parking and/or ride costs
This would make such a difference in using the AB1 to the airport!! I’m often too early or too late based on current
1 hr bus times. 30 min bus times would make a significant positive impact
This would be so helpful! Last time I rode the AB1 route from Denver to boulder there were too many people and
the bus filled up. We had to wait for another one. Having buses run more frequently would help so much.
Thanks! The buses have been getting crowded, and half hour frequency will encourage to ride
Love it
This is. A great service but doesn’t run enough and I’ve missed getting on first bus a lot so I have to wait and take
a second

Attachment: Proposed January 2025 Service Change Survey Results 11.4.24 (5028 : January 2025 Service Change)

More buses are essential to make this route more accessible.
Please! I swear every time I fly back to Denver I end up missing the bus by 5 min and have to wait another hour. I
would love if we cut this down to every 30 min. Also I would love if the bus ran later in the evening because I’ve
almost missed the 11:15 pm bus and that would have meant waiting until the 5 am bus or taking a very expensive
uber.
We desperately need increased frequency on this route. We use it every time we go to the airport and lately it’s
been standing room with some people being turned away. Plus it’s brutal having to wait an additional 40 mins to
get on the bus after your flight.
I use this service for 99% of my trips to and from DIA. Buses on this route have standing room only during peak
travel times. Sometimes passengers waiting in line are left behind. An increase in service would have a strongly
positive impact to this route. Please increase the frequency to every 30 minutes during peak times.
Would prefer a past midnight bus from DEN to Boulder more than the other way around. Many flights get into
Denver after the last bus departs, and the old 1am bus really helped.
Yes! This line needs more buses more frequently
This service increase will make me more likely to take the AB1 to the airport from my house near Broadway and
Table Mesa. Currently, I take it when the AB1 is well timed for my flights in both directions, but the infrequent
service outside of core hours makes me take other transportation options sometimes. I’ve also been stranded at
the airport when my return flight is delayed, and I arrive after the last AB1 bus arrives. It’d be nice to have one
more AB1 leaving the airport at 1 am every day so I don’t have to worry about paying over $100 for an Uber when
I’m exhausted and just want to get home.
More late night service please. I've been stranded at 2a.m. too many times
I've had to stand or wait for the next bus due to overcrowding to the point that I drive to the airport instead
depending of flight times.
Reopen boulder Junction route. Based on the current, consistent limited availability and uncomfortable fullness of
AB route (standing room only)I have discontinued use. Definitively increase frequency. Standing room only on the
way to the airport, and long lines with completely full buses resulting in inability to board at DIA are unacceptable.
Particularly at seasonal/CU breaks, an increased number of buses on routes are a no- brainer. Or just give me
the train I paid for.
This bus is now regularly standing room during non holiday periods. Both dangerous and unacceptable. More
frequent buses are necessary.

30 minute intervals will likely allow me to get a seat on the bus from mccaslin. Every airport ride I’ve taken in the
last year has people standing by mccaslin or flatirons. An additional early morning one to beat the 90 minute gap
between the 3:30 and 5am one would be super helpful too.

Later busses from DIA would be extremely helpful if a flight arrives late. Thank you!
More buses would help as some folks are standing and it can be tricky

This would be good since most buses going both ways are full. I’ve been rejected from boarding multiple times by
the time the bus arrives at Via Varra stops.

Great idea
The proposed change would increase our usage of the AB1 to and from DIA,
Every 30min service would be awesome because the wait at the airport can be pretty long if you just miss the
bus. Thanks for doing this!!
The 30-minute service in the morning and evening is very much needed. Buses to the airport in the morning
frequently are standing room only all the way from the back to the front of the bus and evening buses are full.
Expanding to midnight for trips from DEN to Boulder would be very much welcomed for times when flights come
in late; for us, this has been happening multiple times per year.
Critical to expand service on this route as it is much-used - great to have it be later in the day if flights are late or
scheduled to arrive too late to take the bus.
30 minute service interval all day would be even better!
Expanding bus service frequency between Boulder and Denver Airport is a crucial step toward enhancing regional
connectivity and sustainability. Increased bus frequency would provide a reliable and convenient transportation
option for travelers, reducing the reliance on personal vehicles. This shift not only alleviates traffic congestion on
the I-25 corridor but also significantly decreases greenhouse gas emissions, aligning with broader environmental
goals. Moreover, a more robust public transit option would serve students, professionals, and tourists alike,
making travel more accessible and affordable for all demographics.
In addition to environmental benefits, expanding bus service frequency can stimulate local economies. Enhanced
connectivity can attract more visitors to Boulder’s attractions and businesses, while also providing Boulder
residents with easier access to the economic opportunities available in Denver. Improved bus service can also
reduce parking pressures at the airport, making travel smoother for everyone. By investing in public transit
infrastructure, we can create a more integrated transportation network that not only meets current demands but
anticipates future growth, ultimately fostering a healthier, more sustainable urban ecosystem.
I take this bus to/from the airport regularly. Having more frequent and later service will help me a great deal.
Thank you
This is an excellent change. I’m extremely grateful for this, as this will absolutely stimulate more ridership. It may
be a good idea to run a related advertising campaign in the Boulder area, “$10 to DIA every half hour” or
something to that effect.
Please please PLEASE re-open Boulder Depot and have either AB1 or AB2 start/end here - incredibly useful bus
line prior to COVID and it is sorely missed.

30 minute frequency all day would be preferred because it's so frustrating just wanting to get home after a trip but
instead you have to wait up to an hour for the next bus to come.
The AB1 is a great route that is almost always packed and encourages me to not use a car so this is great
Thanks. I’ve been stuck paying $140.00 for an Uber late at night from the airport. If flights are arriving and
departing, there should be bus service.
I am so happy to hear about this service expansion. I do wish there was an even later night service from DENBoulder, perhaps at 1am or 1:20. This would strongly support my ability to book flights that get late into DEN. Not
entirely sure what the benefit of a midnight Boulder-DEN bus is. Increased frequency just makes me more likely
to use the bus instead of driving!
I always use the bus for transport to and from the airport. More frequent buses would improve greatly!
Would benefit from past midnight trips from DEN to Boulder. Many flights arrive around midnight, and it would give
me the option to take these flights without having to choose between an expensive Uber and sleeping at the
airport.
I love taking AB1 to the airport, but I'm always a little afraid it will fill up.
Buses are very full, to the point where I have concerns if there's going to be space. More trips is very welcome to
reduce congestion and allow for more options.
Also really excited about more late night trips to accommodate late flights.
Thank you for reinstating AB1 service past 11pm. This is a crucial missing service.
Almost always there is no capacity from DIA to Boulder until waiting an extra hour for the next bus. The bus (or if
certain hours are less busy, smaller shuttle) should always depart at least every 30 minutes.
The increase in frequency is EXCELLENT. I would be curious to hear from RTD about the previous practice of
sending out extra buses when people on the AB route were left at the bus stop because the bus was full. I
experienced that back in 2019 and it was such a relief. I'm sad to hear about so many people scrambling for
transport when they were not allowed on the bus and the only alternative from RTD was to wait an hour for the
next bus and HOPE it wasn't also full.
I am confused about why the east bound route would run later than the west bound route. I've never had a flight
time where I couldn't take the bus because the flight was too late, but there have been MANY times where we
couldn't get home on the west bound route because a flight came in too late to catch a bus.

Attachment: Proposed January 2025 Service Change Survey Results 11.4.24 (5028 : January 2025 Service Change)

The last two times I was on the AB, there was standing room only. On the way to the airport, we could not pick up
the last stop, and I felt terrible for those riders. For this reason the increased frequency is essential.

We need later buses from DEN to Boulder - do you realize how many flights arrive at midnight or later? This is no
other cost-effective way home. This is consistently a crowded bus to and from the airport - added service is
certainly justifiable.

Increased schedule frequency solves all of my problems with AB1.

This would reduce anxiety about relying on the AB route for late rides back from the airport, and for ensuring I'll
definitely get on a bus on the way to the airport. I'll likely ride it more now with these changes.
I support this change; however, as someone who lives near the Lafayette park and ride there are still no good
ways for me to get to the airport using RTD.
We need more routes from the airport to Boulder. With a frequency of only once an hour, it often means choosing
between a 45+ minute wait at the airport or just getting an Uber. That’s the route that would have the greatest
impact for ridership. The narrow window to make a bus that leaves every X:20 means I’m usually getting a ride
share home.
When I use the RTD AB1 line it's generally a good experience but it's very typical for me to have to wait a long
time for the bus back to Boulder. I live in Gunbarrel and would like to drive to McCaslin RTD, park and ride the
bus to the airport.
I'd love to see the route run every 30 mins. Getting off the plane and having to rush to the bus can be stressful. If
theres two buses per hour this would be an huge improvement.
this is sorely needed, thank you
Bus between Boulder and DIA needs to be more frequent - people not being allowed to board due to full is totally
unsat - NOT OK for people to miss s flight due to bus. People having to stand the entire way is also unsat and
potentially dangerous.
Bus should run 24/7 in my opinion - there is such a thing as a delayed or simply late flight that gets into DIA at
midnight, etc. Unsat to have to shell out $100 for taxi due to lack of bus. Unsat to have to wait in airport for hours
until bus resumes service the next day.
These proposed changes are great and will likely spur additional use, particularly on the DEN to Boulder route as
people are more willing to wait 30 minutes rather than an hour if they just miss a bus on their return travel. I am a
regular (at least 1x/month) user of the AB1 and while I always take it to the airport, I’m likely to take an Uber home
if I have a 30+ minute wait for the next bus. This will largely resolve that problem.
More frequent buses means I'll be taking Uber or driving my own car to the airport less. I'd also like to see buses
after midnight from the airport to Boulder, for times when flights get in very late.
Please have trips past midnight from den to boulder
Increased service will ensure me and others will have a reliable way to get to the airport. I really enjoy the AB1
and the only thing that might be an issue is lack of service causing me and others to miss our bus

Please make this change! I use this bus, visiting friends and family use this bus. I am a NECO pass holder and
love RTD. It is incredibly frustrating to not be able to make a bus home because it’s too full.
The Boulder AB1 bus is always packed and could show a huge benefit from increased service. Also, many times I
have been stuck at the airport due to lack of late return busses from the airport to Boulder, and this change would
help alleviate that.
The AB buses are often at capacity, making the trip to the airport uncertain. A higher frequency of bus would help
with this. The last bus from the airport to Boulder is too early, stranding many travelers who arrive on later flights.
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE
On several occasions, I needed to shell out for an expensive uber due to the infrequent/inconvenient airport bus
schedule. I want to take this bus, but a frequent schedule is a requirement for it to by my default choice. Plus -- it's
always so packed!
Extending hours to midnight would allow us to take the AB1 on return trips back to DIA.
Longer hours and more frequent services!
This is much needed, especially during the holiday season. Thank you very much for listening to your riders!
Lately it’s been so crowded the entire aisle was filled with standing passengers right up to the driver’s shield.
Would love more frequent service so folks can have seats.
Additionally the once an hour current schedule means having to get to airport extra early OR having to drive/Uber
if you miss the route or can’t fit on because next bus is too far away. (Once bus was cancelled and folks had to
hop in strangers cars to still make flights). Would like more flexibility and backup options and 30 min frequency
would definitely help.
Great idea. Will be so useful
The changes in frequency and lateness of the final departure from DIA will make a huge difference in my travel
planning and execution. Thank you for listening to your customers on this route!
Great changes and will result in people waiting around less
Providing "past midnight" service from Boulder to DEN does not make a lot of sense given that security screening
is closed from 1-3 AM daily.

I love having accessibility to the AB1 because the proposed light rail to/from boulder/Denver never happened.
Ridership has increased dramatically in the past few years since Covid, the buses in service need to respond
accordingly. I now do not consider taking the AB1 as I am unsure if I’ll actually be able to get on board at the east
flatiron station stop due to how often the buses are full and riders are turned away. The AB1 services riders in
Broomfield, Lafayette, Boulder, Louisville, Erie, and more. It’s tragic it’s taken so long to bring service back up to
match the demand of this line.
Increased airport route usage is a positive step. Particularly adding later service which will allow travelers to
spend their money on public transit rather than expensive Ubers.
Having access to usable transit options requires that transit to come at a rate where it is useful to many groups of
people and more time options is an essential part of that. It is difficult to catch a transit option that does not come
frequently as the time may not work for many people's schedules. Adding increased service frequency is vital to
many transit users in making lines actually usable for them.
I’ve been using AB1 for a couple of years now (and wish I’d started much sooner). I use this route to get to and
from the airport when I travel. As I see it, if I miss my bus another will come along in 30 minutes so that would be
very helpful.
AB is usually standing room only. Change is desperately needed.
I've heard that this is a profitable line for RTD. If that's the case, why not increase frequency to every 15 or 20
minutes? Make this line so appealing that it's profit supports other lines. Most people won't wait 30 minutes, they'll
just drive.
This is a good change. The bus is frequently full/over capacity for the 2:47pm DEN arrival eastbound on Fridays.
I have been stuck at airport for an hour after just missing a pickup. I’ve avoided taking this route if there wasn’t a
convenient time in the past.
Traffic is bad on this street and I support bringing more bus transit to keep the roads moving!
I ride to work. 30 freq. makes more usable before and after work. 30 min. Freq. makes the Sunday schedule time
change less impactful.
I don’t understand why the schedule is only 1 bus an hour from the airport. This causes unnecessary lines and
wait time. The schedule should be every 30 minutes each way, especially during holidays and peak travel times.
I live in zip code 80023 in Broomfield. Our community has grown very fast and there is not enough public
transportation in our area hence we are forced to use cars.
Adding an AB1/AB2 stop near I25 and 470E interchange area will increase your ridership significantly. We all talk
about this in our community meetings.

YAY- thank you!!!

1) This route connects the airport to an area that doesn't have easy access to the A Line or other options which is
extremely beneficial for people coming from both directions
2) Increased frequency equals improved convenience which is what is required to improve ridership, NOT the
other way around
3) This route and improved convenience will further alleviate car traffic for those who still want or need to drive
Thank you for any and all increased service frequency on the AB routes. Buses are often standing room only
which is dangerous and makes travel with children difficult!
It's great to see increased frequency, this will make taking the bus to the airport much easier. 15 minute frequency
would be even better!
Please reopen Boulder junction station, and have the AB2 bus start there. There's so much housing being built
there but poor transit service. I live walking distance from that station but can't easily or quickly get access to the
AB or FF buses.
Increasing bus frequency/capacity is sorely needed. Often riders are turned away at peak hours.
Very happy to see more AB1 times and the addition of AB2. We've stopped taking the AB to the airport because of
the reduced times that it runs and because of bus overcrowding. It would be great to be able to take the AB again
with these changes!
The addition of a midnight westbound trip is fantastic and very much needed. However, the after-midnight addition
should would also be more beneficial if it was Westbound as well. Perhaps, the midnight westbound route runs to
Boulder, then immediately returns back to the airport at 1am, and then again goes back to Boulder at 2am. This
would be ideal, as there are many many flights that don't arrive at DIA until midnight or later, and then are often
delayed which requires a bus at 1am or later.
As a frequent AB1 rider, I greatly appreciate the expansion to service every 30 minutes especially as buses have
been full and lines long lately. It would be great for service past midnight to be from DEN to Boulder instead of
Boulder to DEN.
I'm very excited about more frequent AB1 scheduling, as it is currently frustrating to try and time the bus both for
arriving at the airport & for returning to Boulder after a flight. Nothing more frustrating than missing the AB1
departing the airport by a couple minutes and having to wait an entire hour. The switch to half hour frequency,
even if not universal, will be a much appreciated improvement.
Prefer more evening Westbound service.

Thank you for providing more service, including longer availability during the day and more frequency, to make

Extending night time and increasing frequency is a huge improvement. midnight is still a bit stingy for west bond
given that flights can get delayed
This change is long overdue. I am happy to see service finally being increased to the Airport!
Buses every 30 minutes would be much more convient and help reduce crowding on the bus. A later midnight bus
from the airport would also be convient as many flights arrive late at night.
The number of times I’ve been stranded at DIA because my flight got in past 11pm is crazy. This has been
needed for a while
I don't know why past-midnight service is being considered for eastbound service, but not westbound. Given the
choice, I'd MUCH rather have later westbound services. Hands down, no contest. I have never needed the
eastbound AB1 at 1am but I have needed the westbound AB1 at 1am.
I am very excited for the midnight bus back to Boulder as I have missed the 11:20pm by a mere 5 minutes too
many times to count! Very good change!
So great to see a later WB bus from the airport! This is such a great change! Would love it even more if there was
an after-midnight WB bus from the airport, too.
30 minute frequency is badly needed for the AB route. The bus is very often standing room only, so there is
clearly demand for it. And missing a bus home from the airport because your incoming flight is a few minutes
delayed is much less of a problem if you don’t have to wait a full hour for the next bus. Thank you so much for this
change!!!
Long overdue, given the high ridership and often packed buses. It has also been very important that many fewer
trips are canceled/delayed, since I don't know what people do when their airport bus (particularly a very early
morning one) is canceled, since there aren't any good alternatives -- and that no doubt turns them off from using
the bus the next time.
Also, a comment on one change in particular. You note that you will restore a late bus from DEN to Boulder at
midnight. That's great, but it used to be at 12:20am, and, yes, I can assure you from much experience that those
20 minutes makes a big difference, so please consider going back to that schedule. You also note that there will
be a bus after midnight from Boulder to DEN, which makes no sense to me unless you really mean another early
morning bus, which would be nice since there is a 90-minute gap between the first and second bus to DEN.
We fly into DIA fairly often from Vermont and almost always take the AB to Boulder and then back to DIA at the
end of our visit. It's a great service and a terrific value. There are many times that we fly into the "rush hour" at the
airport and have to wait another hour to catch the bus. While this may not seem like a deal (and it isn't compared
to many other issues)it is frustrating when we just miss the bus. And conversely from Boulder to DIA sometimes
we have to leave earlier than necessary because the busses don't leave at 30 minute intervals.

Attachment: Proposed January 2025 Service Change Survey Results 11.4.24 (5028 : January 2025 Service Change)

This is a much needed change. This bus is my preferred way to get to the airport and every time I ride, it is always
full, and often standing room only, or has to leave people behind. Additionally, I’ve had to stay overnight at the

More frequent service makes it much easier to get to key locations(Airport, downtown) and makes the light rail a
more reasonable mode of transport
This will be very helpful in me getting to Union station.
I take the light rail when the bus is delayed and sometimes the light rail and bus are equally delayed. The
proposed changes would be beneficial as a more reliable form of transportation
Could use another minute or two between when eastbound W line reaches Auraria West and southbound E line.
How many additional operators are projected to be needed between now and the implementation of this schedule

E Line is goated
Trash service damn it just run on time.
Would love to see higher frequencies during rush hour. Every 7 mins between 8am-9am and 4pm-5pm. That
would be amazing!!
This is a great start though and big improvement. 15 minute intervals makes me more confident in choosing to
ride instead of drive.
Increasing service frequency to every 15 minutes M-F between 7:00 - 9:00 AM and 4:00 - 6:00 PM would be huge
for convenience of commuters as well as those attending events at Ball Arena / Coors Field / Empower Field and
surrounding business district!
I will believe these "proposed changes" when I see they are actually working. What are you going to do about
security on the E-Line, Union Station, and between Union Station and the E-Line? Will there be ANY coordination
of timing between the G-Line and the E-Line? There is no safe way to get from the commuter rail lines to the light
rail. You either have to dodge traffic (which is usually SAFER) or deal with the homeless in the bus terminal
running under ground.
Lifted all the speed restriction
The return of service every 15 minutes is fantastic news
Since the beginning of summer, the E line has seen drastically diminished service capacity due to repairs and
route changes on the H and D lines. A return to 15 minute service frequency would be a huge boon to the
commuters that frequently take the E in the mornings and afternoons. Thank you!
YES!! We need every 15 minutes back. Having the train be reliable is a game changer for my day and trust in
RTD. I would greatly appreciate this change

Reduced frequencies on the E Line make commuting between central downtown and anywhere south of
Southmoor Station a logistical headache with little margin for error, especially since the shutdown of the F Line.
Whether heading north or south, any cancellation or delay on the D, E, or H Lines often means missing a
connection and being left waiting for a long time at a station.

Reinstated 15 minute service on the E Line, with reliability to keep to the schedule, is an absolute non-negotiable
for me. The delays, construction, lack of drivers, whatever the current excuse may be, is pushing me to leave the
city of Denver. I have lived coast to coast and never experienced inefficiencies like I have with RTD over the past
4 years. What should be a painless commute under 25 minutes door to door regularly takes me over an hour, as it
did this evening while the sun went down and the temps plummeted.
I'll believe your
trains will be on time when I see it happen. You're just gonna cancel every other
like you do now so who gives a flying
I don’t ride the light rail anymore since the F line was removed so this would cause me to consider taking it again
Thank christ
I used to take this train every day but it has become unreliable so I’ve been walking over a mile to bus for the past
few months. Higher frequency will be great, but more important is that the RTD app and Google maps time of
train arrival is accurate
More scheduled times between Union Station and Ridgegate (and vice versa)are a good thing. I just wish the
duration of the trip could be faster. Even if RTD could add “express” routes like they do in Japan…don’t stop at
every stop to get you to your destination faster. Maybe try on big sports or concert days. Or during rush hour. Just
a thought.
Please!
This will make it so I can increase how often I use transit.
Light rail for E and H is HORRIBLE at the moment. Has been useless for two years. This would be great
improvement!! I could take public transport to work again.
Thank you for going back to 15 minute intervals! It will make my life so much easier when it comes to commuting
by train.
Increase frequency to every 15 minutes is great but only if you don’t cancel all of the increased trains. Service to
the very south since of town(Ridgegate station) has been poor and very unreliable to the point of being
completely unusable.
Increased E line frequency would be incredibly helpful to transport to and from work! Increasing to 15 minute
intervals would give me more flexibility to plan to take the rail to work!
More frequency would really help me as I get out of my job at different times of the day and sometimes I just
barely miss the E and have to wait 30 minutes. It’s still so much better than once an hour!

Please reinstate the 15-minute schedule for the E line. People have to get to work. It's astonishing that you think a
regular commuter line should run every 30 minutes. No mass transit system in the country runs its lines so rarely

Post new schedules NOW! I spent 40 minutes waiting for the e line the other day. Why would I use such an
unreliable form of transportation?
I can't wait till all the lightrail trains are back running every 15 minutes. I've been so frustrated with the slow downs
and cancelation. It's been a hassle to get anywhere under 2 hours if you're using the train.
I am often left waiting 15 minutes or more for an e line train to arrive. I am a student in boulder who lives in
denver, and the first bus I can take to union gets me there at 4:00, and the e line freqeuently does not arrive until
4:20-4:25 or later, this would make my commute significantly easier and allow me to effectively increase my free
time by at least an hour a day.
If this change is unreliable, however, it does even more damage. Please ensure that this change is done with that
in mind. Reliability is the most important trait of strong public transport to people like me who rely on it
Definitely a great proposed change!! It feels like for every E line train there are 2-3 W line trains :(
the line is very unreliable right now. trains get cancelled all the time or the schedule is not updated to reflect
cancelled trains. the 15 minute frequency would do a lot for people who ride the train but if frequency is
increased, we need the operators available to do it so trains don't get cancelled. there would be no reason to I
crease the frequency if half the time trains are cancelled like they are now.
Going back to the 15 minute service frequency would be much appreciated, as well as eliminating the current
slowdowns that are making transit slower. Thanks !
Greater frequency and reliability may improve usage and demand of RTD rail services by employees. We are
looking to renew our RTD Eco pass but employees don't use it much as its unreliable and there are not many trips
offered.
Increased timing of trains that go to Ball Arena are only helpful if frequent trains are still provided when scheduled
events end. Please ensure the 15 minute train timing continues through at least 10pm
With increased 15 minute service frequency, making connections from D line would save us time commuting
south Denver to downtown or to airport for work and travel. Thank You RTD for moving Denverites around the city
with ease. Very much appreciate the work and help you provide us.
This change is very important to my commute.

I have had to drive most days from Boulder to my job at DU because of the E line running so infrequently.

THANK YOU!!!! I stopped using the light rail when the schedule was made less frequent and I know of at least
two other coworkers that felt the same. I will love taking this train to work again with the increased frequency.
I need the E Line to commute to school everyday and I have been unable to do so this semester due to the
construction, constant delays, and unreliability of the train. It would positively effect me to change back to 15
minute frequencies
More frequent trains are always welcome!
when the E-line only runs once an hour, it makes it difficult and a waste of time when trying to get downtown for a
game or to Mile High to watch the Broncos, and the carts are jammed packed, so you have to wait another hour
for the next train to arrive
Please increase frequency to 15. It helps a lot, thank you.
Thank you so much for going back to 15 minute intervals. This summer has been infuriating. More than anything,
please prioritize being ON TIME. It is impossible to plan my life around trains that show up super late or not at all.
It will be positive if the trains will run on schedule, but that has not been the case for some time. Will this change
increase the likelihood of the trains running on time?
Current service is pathetic, terrible there is no such thing as on time, reliability. There is one time on RTD app, at
station on display another time (if display working) and train comes at different times, slows down, stops on the
tracks totally thrash. You currently have very low or no bar as reliability, customer service so anything is better
than current nightmare
Thank you for this
I could start taking it to work again, I did most of last year but started driving when it reduced frequency because it
wasn’t practical
I like what you have proposed. More!
The Increased Swvise would allow me and many other to be able to rely on the light rail line more rather than
what it is at now.
Thank you. I gave up riding the E Line on a routine basis for at least the last 2-3 years, due to scheduling,
extended ride times, crime and poor communication. .
We utilize this park and ride and route when traveling from COS to Amtrak.

Over the last few years you let this line go, security was never there, you let the drug addicts take over, we call it
the Meth line at work. Now the service is terrible, tried it again yesterday on the 3:09 at at Arapahoe Village

I take the train everyday to and from work so it’s important that is reliable and on time for me. Service increase
also provides me with better ease at night being able to get on a train quicker.

The 483 bus that I like to use does not always align with when the E line arrives at or leaves from Lincoln Station.
A service increase -if achieved- will certainly reduce wait times for me and make the 483 bus more viable. I think
an increase of frequency of the 483 bus would also help, but this should be a first step.
Re-instating 15-minute frequency will help me visit my friends more often and travel to the Denver tech center
without a car more often.
Love the 15 min frequency on the E line. This will really help me use the RTD for commuting to work.
ELine was really not reliable for commute.With this I had to spend 1:45min each way for my office commute.
Totally not acceptable. It was all ok until 2022 with 15min and very reliable schedule without delay in the middle.
With 5days work week coming back this is blocking me from continuing my work.
It would give me more flexibility during my commute between home and work.
I used to take the E line daily. However, when the schedule was reduced and then the reliability of the E line
showing up on time became nonexistent, I could no longer count on the E line to get to/from work so I ended up
purchasing a vehicle instead, which puts additional vehicles on our already crowded roads!
The schedules should be adjusted to better reflect delays please!
Increasing frequency to 15 minutes is a great first step towards higher frequency and improving transit. Thanks to
the RTD
The current e line schedule is very unreliable with many of the common commuter times hit having an available
driver. With the proposed service changes, I expect there to be more reliable service, trains leaving and
ARRIVING in time, and to have drivers available throughout the day. The frequency increase does no good if
there are no drivers available.
Yes please! More frequency makes the whole system more usable!
Currently the wait times are longer than projected. Delays and 30 minute increments make it difficult to navigate
the city. Reinstating 15 minute intervals will be great for everyone!
Please bring the E Line every 15 minutes!
It’s critical that we have the E line back to 15 minute headways. It’s still very difficult to use, especially when trying
to make connections from other lines, at the current frequency.
The schedule needs to be more consistent and on time. I am a college student and I have to arrive an hour and a
half early to school every day to ensure that I am on time and not late because of how inconsistent the trains are.

Attachment: Proposed January 2025 Service Change Survey Results 11.4.24 (5028 : January 2025 Service Change)

Increasing to 15 minutes will ensure students get to school timely, especially when trains are running behind.
There is no benefit to taking the train if you can drive faster and more reliably.

I live in Castle Rock & Ridgegate is the closest station… I used to ride the light rail to Denver every weekend to
visit friends, shop, etc. & it became very tedious to do so when the frequency was 1 train per hour. 15 minute
intervals would change everything for me.

Need 15 minute trains with a reliable schedule. Also need 15 minute trains from Union Station after 9PM to return
from Coors Field and Ball Arena.

I work at Ball Arena and the Stadium at times. Having every 15 minute service will get more people in and out
faster from events.
Thank you for the proposal to restore 15 minute headways. I hope this can continue through the summer to make
light rail more usable!
Needs to be more reliable as many students at Auraria campus use this line.
Thank you!
I’ll believe it when I see it ::shrug::
This would be an excellent change. As is, my commute on the E line used to be 30 minutes now takes over an
hour. With the delays, there have been time where I missed my train and had to wait an extra 30 minutes. When
you’re trying to get home to your family, a 30 minute commute vs. a 90 minute commute is a big difference.
Thanks!
Reliability back on the line would be immensely helpful. I have been late to work while repairs were done and
often had to use rideshare,.which got very expensive. Better reliability would also mean I can go to appointments
on time
I'm totally in favor of increasing it back to the 15 minute increments!
I work in LoDo next Union Station and since service interruptions there has been no reliability in the service of the
E line to get to work on time!
I travel from Englewood via route 12 to Louisiana and Pearl to the E line in the past now I have to rely on the 0 to
get downtown!!
It sure would be nice to be able to rely on the frequency of the E line or even bring back the C line Mineral to
Union Station.
Finally!!
Slow downs on the E line this past year have made commuting to work much more difficult. Reinstating 15 min
cadence will make work commute much less stressful
I have spent large amounts of money paying for parking at Ball Arena for hockey games. For years I have
travelled by train to the games. If the times remained at once per hour and the speeds remained at 10 mph I
would have to vote against any tax increase due to the current schedule costing me way more than the tax money
I would cede to RTD.
Please add more trains especially on sports game days

I take it to work daily and it helps a lot when they run every 15.
These lines are so important for my commute and seeing family. The 15-minute frequency would reduce my wait
time.
Would like to see increase in service back to 15 min and more reliability.
Could you let us know if the speed restrictions will be lifted?
Please reinstate 15 minute frequency on the e line. It will help me get to work on time.
This line has frequently been delayed or has been running every hour. I’ve had to either take a commute that’s
too early or pay for another method of transportation. I’d like to continue taking public transportation but the
current schedule does not help my needs. Increasing the frequency will help tremendously.
Increased frequency means it will be easier to make light rail travel fit into my schedule and increases the
likelihood that i will utilize it.
I would take the train more often if missing it didn’t mean having to wait a full hour to catch the next one.
Thank you, increased frequency is very helpful for me and my family!
It would mean I wouldn’t be an hour late to work every time I miss the train because my connecting train is
running late :)
Appreciate the improved frequency!
The reinstated 15 minute frequency is extremely helpful and beneficial to my morning and weekend commute.
Love to see this back to its regular 15 min frequency.
Increasing stop frequency will make the trains actually usable.
RTD can do a better job of running a few extra trains after big events (coors field, ball arena, empower) to help
encourage more transit. Sometimes I have to wait 30-40 minutes for a train after an avalanche or nuggets game.
Same for leaving a Rockies game. If a night game ends after walking to Union Station it’s a 30’ minute wait if I’m
lucky. I can usually take D,E, or H trains back to my stop at Alameda station. But others don’t take the train
specifically because it takes too long to get home from events.
Looking forward to this line getting back to a reliable and dependable form of transportation to get downtown.

Attachment: Proposed January 2025 Service Change Survey Results 11.4.24 (5028 : January 2025 Service Change)

I take the lightrail every day and the recent timing from the maintenance over the past few months has really
negatively impacted my work schedule and timing. Although I think the maintenance was needed, I would look
forward to seeing the original schedule being reinstated, as it would make traveling much easier!

I frequently transfer to the E line from the D line, so having shorter wait times would be awesome.
Will there be sufficient operators to maintain this schedule? I feel every time the E Line gets back on a 15 minute
schedule there are dozens of daily cancellations due to inability to get an operator.

Traffic is bad on the i-25 corridor and I support bringing more rail transit to keep the roads moving!
Please follow-through with re-instating 15-minute service frequency on this rail line. I really want to use the train to
commute downtown, but with current level of service and unreliability of schedule with the derated tracks and
slow zones it can be unusable and often leads to me adding to traffic on I-25.
Shut down portions of the lines for a period so that you can focus on track maintenance day and night. Hire
outside contractors and have buses transporting people from stations if need be
The rerouting of the D and H line to Union during the first phase of the rail reconstruction project was extremely
beneficial for me. I was able to catch a train downtown essentially every 5-10 min. It was such a luxury! Now that
phase 1 has been completed and just the E goes to Union, I find myself catching trains earlier than I would need
to due to concerns with delays. I could miss a train and the next one doesn’t come for another 30 min, not
including whatever additional delays could be potentially setting the arrival back. Those 30-50 min could be the
difference of me making a flight or not. Increased frequency of the E would be greatly appreciated.
Shockingly, more consistent service means better connections for people who plan their work commute using
RTD. Who would have thought?
I'm excited that you're moving back to 15 minute intervals, at least on paper. But I'm extremely skeptical that it can
actually be implemented, given that there are cancelations almost every single day due to no drivers being
available. I'd rather have less service that is 100% reliable, than have more service that is only 25% reliable.
I think higher frequency results in not needing to check the schedule before using transit. This is a big factor in
increasing ridership. Public transit should be easy to use and this is a great improvement.
FREAKIN FINALLY. Trains that run on time? Yes please. I could actually use this to commute to Boulder daily
Before the pandemic we used to have a 10 minute option to go from Ball Arena to Arapahoe. I could use E line or
F line. Those were the good times. But having every 15 minutes is acceptable and will encourage more people to
use the train.
The E line has been very unreliable recently, so increasing service will be great for me and for the people who
need it for their commutes.
15 min headway's would make it rideable again. I haven’t been able to count on train since headways were
increased because it’s hard to count on trains. Longer headways also made for difficult airport timing for both the
a line and the express busses
Given limited service lately we have had to drive when we would have preferred the train. Every 15 min would
change that!!

Attachment: Proposed January 2025 Service Change Survey Results 11.4.24 (5028 : January 2025 Service Change)

This is what it was prior to September change and never should have dropped to every 30 minutes. The first time
I tried to catch a 30 minute one it was cancelled...so that means every 60 minutes!! In over 25 years of riding RTD
it has been the worst and most unreliable the past two months. This is not a way to increase ridership.

Packet Pg. 304

18.F.d

15 minute frequency on the E & H Lines will be a profound improvement. But scheduled frequency means nothing
without reliability. Since the September service changes, both the E & H lines moved to 30 minute frequency, but I
find they are just as unreliable as over the summer. Trains are regularly cancelled and frequently very late. The
real time tracking is often inaccurate, when it’s available at all. I want frequent service, but I need service I can
rely on.
Thank you for reinstating the 15 minute service frequency of the E line, it will make traveling using the RTD
system much better for a lot of people, myself included. I notice that schedule adjustments are also going to be
made, which I have some constructive feedback for. Please try to adjust the schedule for trains departing on the
south bound tracks (E, W, etc.) in a way that makes transfers more reliable for folks taking other commuter lines
in (N, A, 120X, etc.). A lot of customers who ride the E and W lines are transferring from lines from the other part
of the metropolitan area, and the current schedule often only allows a minute or two to make a transfer, which is
not feasible, considering the southbound trains board 2 blocks away. Adjusting the departure times of south
bound trains to accommodate for these folks would improve the transit experience for them, without really
impacting riders whose original destination does not require a train or bus ride to get into Union station.
Thank you.
I used to take light rail all the time, but then found I had no ability to predict when it was coming next, and it was
often late or slower than biking. So I'll be glad to go back to taking the light rail
The E Line really serves many passengers and sometimes the trains have standing room only when I use this
service. This is much appreciated! I look forward to this service change! Thank you, thank you, thank you!
The long wait has been killing me so it arriving every 15 min will be such an effective change.
YESSSSS THANK YOU!!!!
The 30-minute service frequency on the E Line makes commuting between DTC (where I live) and the downtown
business district (where I work) extremely challenging. I strongly prefer riding the train to driving, but it is difficult to
justify doing so when I cannot reliably connect from the D or H Line to the E Line without getting stranded at a
station for up to 30 minutes (or, god forbid, up to an hour if a trip is canceled). Restoring 15-minute headways
would give me a lot more confidence that I can get from home to work and back without wasting a huge chunk of
my day waiting for a train to arrive.
Thank you for increasing the service interval for the E line but my community would rather have the return of the
C line service to Union station. This would increase train frequncy to Union station and improve accessiblity to this
destination that does not rely on mulitple transfers.
We chose to live where we do based upon having frequent service on these lines to downtown. It's important to
return to the 15 minute headways.
Hello - I am slightly concerned about how reliable going back to the every 15 minute schedule will be. There have
been a lot of route cancellations in the last 2 years over insufficient staffing, and the slow zones have made the
routes not so reliable. Can you please keep us up to date in case there might be a struggle transition period still in
Jan 2025?
I would love for my regular transit method to go back to every 15 minutes - these days I get to work faster via bike
because of those slow zones - but am nervous that it will be unreliable still

Should be 5-10 minutes.
RTD cant even operate the 30 minute schedule it has now for the E line.
RTD service is a joke!
You should be embarrassed about the service that your provide!
I think it is a mistake to increase frequencies on the E and H lines again until RTD has enough operators to
consistently operate all scheduled light rail services. Even at the current 30 minute frequencies, services are
routinely being cancelled due to the operator shortage, and these cancellations often mean that it is just easier to
take a few buses rather than waiting to see if the light rail service will actually show up or not. The frequencies
should stay where they are until there are enough operators to consistently operate the scheduled service.
Thank you for providing more service, including longer availability during the day and more frequency, to make
taking transit a more convenient option.
We need an easy to west connection on Arapahoe. Serve the business parks.
Restoring service to 15 minute intervals is a huge step in the right direction. Once the slowdowns are corrected, I
hope RTD can begin to restore trust in the consistency of service to the these parts of the metro.
Yes! All light rail lines should be 15 or less headways
This is the most important service improvement to me
15 minute frequency would be the most absolute perfect change this city could make on the E train line especially
with everyone going south to work
Please prioritize service reliability as well. Does going back to 15 minute frequencies mean an increase in
cancelations due to lack of available operators? I was never confident in the ability to shift from hourly to 15
minutes this fall, even before the slow zones and 30 min frequency. Please only set this schedule if you are
confident you can keep trains running to the posted schedule.
Having the 15 minute increments back will help tremendously.
As a part time student that lives on the I-25 corridor this will massively improve my transportation experience and
will add an hour of studying back into my schedule. Thank you to all the workers that made it possible to resume
15 minute frequencies
I am hopeful this increase in timing will help mitigate the time I wait to get home. The 30 minute schedule paired
with the continued delays north can cause me to wait and extra 30-60 minutes for a train home from work. This is
further impacted by the increased ridership during game nights at all the arenas.

This would be a great benefit to me and many other riders who take the E line to commute. It would make
connecting to any bus or other rail line much more feasible, as some connections required a wait of 30 minutes or
more during this summer when service was reduced to one train every hour. I think it would also greatly help
decrease crowdedness on trains during peak hours, especially on days when many people are taking the E line
downtown for sporting events. I hope that RTD is able to honor this promise of increased reliablility by also
ensuring there are enough drivers.
I would much rather have faster trains than more frequent service. If this route could take you from ridgegate to
union in 20 minutes it would have much more passengers.
Returning to 15 min frequency might help timeliness
Increasing to every 15 minutes would be a Godsend. Right now the service is so unreliable that I am
contemplating stopping taking the light rail. When the train only comes every thirty minutes and you never know
when that is going to be, it makes it impossible to plan your day.
I would rather you keep it every 30 minutes if you can't staff enough trains for every 15 minutes. Also if the
slowdowns will still occur there's no reason to have every 15 minutes. Please fix the slowdowns and the
cancelations before adding more trains.
Please increase to 15 minutes my job would very much appreciate it.
For the love of God please keep it at 15 minutes
Yes
This would make the line rideable again
PLEASE finish the repairs quickly to the tracks to eliminate the slow zones that have made trains late and
unreliable all summer. Also figure out how to hire and retain operators so trains aren’t cancelled due to no
operator available.
Especially at peak hours, 15 minute frequency is desperately needed
I live in Denver and I work at Charles Schwab in Lonetree. I have really been wanting to use the E Line to
commute to and from work but have not been able to do so. This increase would greatly help, but I cannot rely on
the light rail to get to and from work until the frequent service delays stop. I need assurance I will not be late for
my job. If there is a delay, I would appreciate better communication to plan ahead for this. Currently, the listed
times are inaccurate and it breaks trust for potential riders. Many of my colleagues share this sentiment. We wish
to ride the E Line but right now we can’t trust that we will arrive at the scheduled time.
This change would allow those like me to very reliably not only get to where I need to in a timely manor in any
direction but also decrease congestion on trains
Please bring back the F line from Ridgegate

Coming from west Denver (W line), increased service is very helpful to get around Denver. Large wait times at
Auraria west station were common with longer gaps in service of E line
Every 15 minutes on the E line would be great for connection from commuter rail lines
Good job on this change! Very much needed! We would also like to see the F line reinstated from the Lone tree
area to the downtown loop (18th and California).
Bringing back more frequent and reliable rail service would be great. I know many who have lost faith in the
reliability of this line but this could make a huge impact towards improving that confidence in transit riders.
I use the train exclusively to get to work and 15 minute intervals fits this need much better.
This would allow me to get to work on time every day. With the current schedule I have to get there 30 minutes
early or 15 minutes late.
This is fantastic but only if it can be maintained. If trips are getting canceled on a daily business this doesn't help
riders. Please expand the schedule but hold to it!
Southmoor to Colorado Slow Zone makes time much slower, need it to be finished fast.
This allows me more flexibility on my commute. I go from Castle Rock to Union Station every day, so having a 15
minute interval means I'd be better able to meet my home and work commitments. However, better planning for
operators is needed, too
Lots of work commuters use this line and the current 30 min can make getting to work or heading home on time
harder. 15 min would greatly increase reliability and make the train the more convenient travel method
Please reinstate 15 service. I stopped using once the line switch to every 30 minutes as it is very difficult to plan
around
Please also increase speed of travel to pre-construction levels; the light rail used to be the most time-efficient way
to travel 1 or 2 stops down the light rail, but it isn't at the moment
Sometimes the 483 bus does not always align with the arrival of the E line. This change would increase my
options for using the 483. It would also reduce total travel time and waiting time.
Looking forward to having more options!
Please. Please. Make the E line usable again. I've wasted so much time over the last year, between the coping
panels and the slowzones and the hourly headway times. Please go back to 4x/hour!

This route is already well served by the AB1 (and by the FF1 with a transfer to the A line) and it would be a better
use of RTD's resources to create new routes or increase frequency in under serviced areas.
Yes please!
Same as my comments about AB1 - there is just not adequate vehicle capacity nor late-night options on this route
to make it a reliable option to those of us traveling to the airport. When it works, it works great. When you get left
on the curb because there's not enough room, it is a real emergency to find alternate travel options.
Everyone I know that uses the bus loves it!!!
This will lessen the burden on the AB1 which was previously far too infrequent.

I've been on very overcrowded morning buses to the airport from Table Mesa Park and Ride. I'm glad there will be
more frequent service at peak times. Also very glad to read that service to and from the airport will go later, as I've
arrived at DIA after 11:00 a few times and either had to Uber home, or drive the car to long term parking prior to
the trip in order to be able to get home. There seem to be many arrivals at the airport after 11, and other modes of
getting to Boulder also peter out at about 11. These are welcome changes.
We as a community love this bus. It provides us a quick and safe transport to the airport.
I relied on the AB1 to get to the airport extensively when living in Boulder, but I now live in Longmont which the
route doesn’t serve. In addition to AB1/2, having a new airport bus route that serves Longmont would be an
excellent addition to RTD services
I think this will help ease the congestion on the AB busses, allowing folks at the MCaslin and Broomfield stops to
be able to board buses that aren’t overfull or completely full, as has happened the last few times I’ve tried to take
the bus to the airport.
This would be amazing to have express option.
Many of us use RTD for our travel, this helps the commuters.
Please see prior comments for the AB1 route changes - they are the same for this route. Basically, I have seen
many people forced to stand for over 35 mins of the route, and I would appreciate more frequency.
This bus is frequently full and needs additional times traveling both directions. It frequently can not accept
passengers because the bus is full. An additional bus both directions will alleviate customer demand
This potentially means that I would not have to take a car from Glenwood Grove to Table Mesa Park and Ride to
catch the AB bus. It is VERY inconvenient and time consuming to take 205 to downtown and have to have all the
stops along the way on 205 and AB bus from downtown, not to mention the challenge of bringing luggage on the
205. At least the Boulder Junction option allows only taking 205 to the 28th and Canyon stop to do a transfer. I am
hopeful the timing will work out for the transfer.
I do not understand why the AB2 line will run only at peak times. Anyone riding AB knows that peak time includes
evenings and often late night as well. The AB2 route should expand to evening and night service as quickly as
possible. If not 2025, then 2026 for sure once the demand is proven.
Why the Route AB2 does not stop in Longmont to pick up or drop off passengers.
Thank you
Looks good
Thank you! The airport buses are always full, and increased service would make it more convenient :)
Would consider AB2 and RTD for airport travel again.

I miss the AB2. It was super convenient when it existed! (also, if it had a later route that would be super
appreciated as well). Thank you!

Please don't decrease service to South Broadway on the AB1
This should help with the frequency from table mesa.
The AB2 is often quite crowded and it is common for a significant number of passengers to have to stand. I am 81
years old and would really like to have a seat for the ride to the airport. I rely on RTD for my DIA transportation.
Concerned the AB2 has been modified and will not have service to/from Boulder Junction - disappointing and
causes more community uncertainty about when RTD will restore services at Boulder Junction.
Why isn't this starting from the Boulder Junction?
Would support if also had a stop at table mesa
The AB bus routes are a god send, and the more accessibility, the better.
Boulder to DIA buses are often very crowded. More bus routes will make travel to airport more convenient.
I would probably take this bus! Please make it connect well with the Dash and I'm there :)
I usually get on at table mesa, so it sounds like this does not impact me. Why not Boulder Junction Depot
instead? That would be more convenient.
I ride the AB to and from the airport with some frequency. It would be very convenient if the schedule were
increased.
Any additional AB services will be a huge improvement for the entire AB system.
More frequency from Table Mesa is excellent. It would be helpful to re-open the closed bus station at the depot
square area. There are tons of people living in that area and it's easy to uber to most businesses around boulder
from there or Table Mesa P&R.
This is great for us near Canyon!!!
Let’s do it!!’
Please re-open Boulder Junction station and re-start service from there. That area is very poorly served by public
transit, and I would be able to use RTD transit much easier if it was open.
28th and Canyon so far from Boulder Junction, even if the station can't be opened immediately, please move the
stops closer.

Thank you!

Get on/off at mccaslin. Love having more buses. Really incentivizes me not to drive.
I board at the Table Mesa Station. Additional service to this station would have a positive impact on me.
I used to take the AB2 mostly back when it ran, the 28th st stops will be much appreciated to have back!
More buses between boulder and the airport!
Help me understand what happens once people get to Table Mesa. Are you dropping them off at Table Mesa?
Isn’t the route to the airport?
More buses and routes, including express routes to the airport, would be great. Please provide some express
routes that people come to one place and you have a bus full rather than multiple stops.
I would take this or the ab1
More frequent busses to/from the airport will be very welcome!
Expanding bus service frequency between Boulder and Denver Airport is a crucial step toward enhancing regional
connectivity and sustainability. Increased bus frequency would provide a reliable and convenient transportation
option for travelers, reducing the reliance on personal vehicles. This shift not only alleviates traffic congestion on
the I-25 corridor but also significantly decreases greenhouse gas emissions, aligning with broader environmental
goals. Moreover, a more robust public transit option would serve students, professionals, and tourists alike,
making travel more accessible and affordable for all demographics.
In addition to environmental benefits, expanding bus service frequency can stimulate local economies. Enhanced
connectivity can attract more visitors to Boulder’s attractions and businesses, while also providing Boulder
residents with easier access to the economic opportunities available in Denver. Improved bus service can also
reduce parking pressures at the airport, making travel smoother for everyone. By investing in public transit
infrastructure, we can create a more integrated transportation network that not only meets current demands but
anticipates future growth, ultimately fostering a healthier, more sustainable urban ecosystem.
This is an amazing change. More service is highly welcomed!!
Please please PLEASE re-open Boulder Depot and have either AB1 or AB2 start/end here - incredibly useful bus
line prior to COVID and it is sorely missed.
I walk to pick up the AB, and a pickup on 28th@Canyon is .7 miles closer to where I live, which is great!
Hopefully some day this bus can pick up at or near Boulder Junction again.
Having the service cancelled negatively impacted my ability to get to the airport. Maybe if you could offset
departure times with the downtown station the service would be more valuable.

AB1 buses are very full, to the point where I have concerns if there's going to be space. Having another route to
service Boulder is very welcome and provides more options to get the to airport.
This should provide for stops along the way, like at Broadway & Table Mesa. The Park-n-Ride at 36 & Table Mesa
is too risky for theft of entire car or car parts. Make that great parking garage secure!!!
A direct route would be a welcome addition!
This would help everyone at times that are high demand for the route to the airport.
I support this change, but as someone who lives near the Lafayette park and ride there are no good ways for me
to use RTD to get to the airport. If RTD is going to consider adding a modified Boulder/Airport route it would be
nice if one consider the needs of Boulder's suburbs.
Would AB2 proceed then from Table Mesa to the airport?
Having additional service routes to DIA from Boulder would be very welcomed, I have to take anywhere between
6-10 flights a year and having a more sustainable way to park and take a bus into DIA would be so helpful.
this is sorely needed, thank you!
Bus between Boulder and DIA needs to be more frequent - people not being allowed to board due to full is totally
unsat - NOT OK for people to miss s flight due to bus. People having to stand the entire way is also unsat and
potentially dangerous.
Bus should run 24/7 in my opinion - there is such a thing as a delayed or simply late flight that gets into DIA at
midnight, etc. Unsat to have to shell out $100 to taxi due to lack of bus. Unsat to have to wait in airport for hours
until bus resumes service the next day.
This increased service will help me and others be more confident that there will be an available bus when we
need to go to the airport
This would help reduce the load on the AB1 bus, which is almost always packed at peak times
Like the proposed changes to AB1, this will make air travel much much easier. I live on this proposed new route
and will be happy to have the additional option.
More routes to/from Boulder/DIA will encourage more riders and increase the confidence that riders will actually
be able to get on the bus wherever their closest stop is and make it to DIA/Boulder promptly
I’ve only ever had good experiences taking the AB1 route to the airport and back and imagine that I will eventually
ride AB2 and encourage friends and relatives who come to visit me to do the same.

Reopen Boulder Junction. We paid for it; open it and run AB2 from it. While you're at it, reinstate FF4. It's
embarrassing that Boulder Junction remains closed, especially as the transit oriented development around it has
grown substantially despite the transit part being a lie.
Traffic is bad on this street and I support bringing more bus transit to keep the roads moving!
We would really like a stop at I25 and E 450 interchange.
YAY- thank you
Thank you for providing more service, including longer availability during the day and more frequency, to make
taking transit a more convenient option.
1) This route connects the airport to an area that doesn't have easy access to the A Line or other options which is
extremely beneficial for people coming from both directions
2) Increased frequency equals improved convenience which is what is required to improve ridership, NOT the
other way around
3) This route and improved convenience will further alleviate car traffic for those who still want or need to drive
Thank you for any and all increased service frequency on the AB routes. Buses are often standing room only
which is dangerous and makes travel with children difficult!
Please reopen Boulder junction station, and have the AB2 bus start there. There's so much housing being built
there but poor transit service. I live walking distance from that station but can't easily or quickly get access to the
AB or FF buses.
28th & Canyon is already closer to the downtown station, so it's hardly helping much to have the AB2 start there.
Increasing frequency/capacity is sorely needed as riders are often turned away at peak hours.
Same as previous
As a former user of the old AB2 route (from Boulder Junction), I am somewhat enthused to see a return of AB2 in
any form... though its usefulness will probably depend on the exact route. If I am able to use AB2 directly without
needing to go to downtown Boulder, it will be incredibly useful.
Having more busses, and also busses nearer to my house are great
I am happy to see service finally being increased to the Airport!
This would be great! I have to walk about 20 minutes to the Downtown Boulder Station to catch the AB1, so being
able to walk less than 10 minutes to get the AB2 would be a big improvement!

Attachment: Proposed January 2025 Service Change Survey Results 11.4.24 (5028 : January 2025 Service Change)

Having access to usable transit options requires that transit to come at a rate where it is useful to many groups of
people and more time options is an essential part of that. It is difficult to catch a transit option that does not come
frequently as the time may not work for many people's schedules. Adding increased service frequency is vital to
many transit users in making lines actually usable for them.

Anything that increases the frequency of buses between Boulder and the airport is a positive change. Judging
from the number of times I’ve been on the AB with standing room only, there is clearly demand for more buses.
Thank you for this change!
This is going to be a significant improvement to the airport transit as a resident living near 30th and Colorado.
Previously we had to walk over to Broadway and it was a hassle particularly in early morning time. We would
greatly benefit from this AB2 bus, and it would be even better if it offered early morning (3-4 am) service to DIA
and late night (11pm - 1am) service from DIA.
Great that this new route will result in some 30-minute headways from Table Mesa PnR. While I agree that
running a bus down Canyon and then 28th Street will be helpful, I still think that you need to restore the old AB2,
which started at the now completely unused Boulder Junction terminal.
Yes please we need this.
I’m very excited for this route since I live right off canyon blvd. An alternate route will make service even more
convenient for me.
There are riders of the AB bus who come in from Gunbarrel, Niwot, and Longmont. There are users of the AB bus
who live or work in Boulder Junction. While I appreciate bringing some service a bit east and serving the 28th
STreet corridor, I don't understand why RTD is not bringing the bus by Boulder Junction. Residents of this area
have virtually no transit, despite living in a transit oriented community. These people don't need to park for the
bus, they need a bus that brings them where they live.
Those of us who live north, just need a simple connection in to town to catch or come home from the airport bus.
I've found that if I have to drive and I park at Table Mesa, I can be home in the time the bus takes to get to
downtown Boulder. Other riders have taken the bus to stops like 28th & Canyon where they can get off the Bolt
and make a quick connection to the AB bus. Let's try to make this easier to be more attractive to users.
For my most recent trip, we got an overpriced Lyft to get to Table Mesa then take the bus to the airport. Busing all
the way would have added an hour in the morning. On the way home we were pleasantly surprised that we did
make the Bolt bus home. Despite the schedule saying we had ten minutes for the connection, the full bus that day
gave us only three minutes for the connection.
I've talked to many people living northeast of Boulder who would love to use the airport bus more often but want
the connections to be easier. I'm hoping that the timing of the AB2 will be such that one can confidently take the
205 or Bolt and make the transfer and save us from traveling all the way downtown
This will be amazing to have increased service to and from the airport--so happy to see this come back!
Downtown Boulder station AND table mesa station are already served by the AB1. Trips to the airport can also be
made via the FF1/FF2 and the A from both these stations. It seems like these service hours could be better used
for service improvements in Boulder or additional Intercity routes.

Attachment: Proposed January 2025 Service Change Survey Results 11.4.24 (5028 : January 2025 Service Change)

Please increase service frequency! Half hour frequency is much needed on this crowded line. I also appreciate
extending service past midnight, but a WB (DEN to Boulder) line would be much more valuable after midnight
than EB (Boulder to DEN), which is proposed, since few flights depart so late but many arrive late.

Similar to my last answer, I take the light rail as an alternative to the bus, and theoretically it should be faster but
sometimes both the light rail and bus are equally slow or infrequent. I would really like if frequency was increased
even more than 15 minutes to guarantee reliability, but this change would still be a big improvement to still
improve efficiency
I am a student and I have suffered alot from those long wait times of RTD and the very few times that the train
come,
The unreliability of the train slow downs has made it impossible to plan accordingly. The train shows up when it
shows up, and you are going to be late for wherever you are going. Take luck.

Similar comments as on the E Line. Commuting between the southeast Denver metro and central downtown
requires frequent and reliable service on each of the D, E, and H Lines.

Much more flexibility and can come a bit late from my college
This will be amazing. Thank you
They need to have security and enhance the speed people have jobs to attend
They have been doing construction since I’ve been here in July and the train goes slow once
It hits halfway towards aurora
Its way too late and it barely passes at all.
Current delays due to track maint have been a challenge. Hire more drivers. I had to catch the D line and have
my wife pick me up today due to cancellations. I live a block from the Dayton station so it is easy for me to ride
when the trains are on time
I'll believe your
trains will be on time when I see it happen. You're just gonna cancel every other
like you do now so who gives a flying fuck!?
The increased frequency will allow me to once again use the service without a lot of challenges, delays, and
waiting.
This is a good change, but most importantly, digital schedules and tracking apps need to be updated to match
with the new times. They are close to useless at the moment because they are very unreliable and inaccurate,
which often results in missed departures.
It's about time
I used to take this train every day but it has become unreliable so I’ve been walking over a mile to bus for the past
few months. Higher frequency will be great, but more important is that the RTD app and Google maps time of
train arrival is accurate
15 min should be a minimum
Light rail for E and H is HORRIBLE at the moment. Has been useless for two years. This would be great
improvement!! I could take public transport to work again
Thank you for proposing to reinstate the 15-minute increment for these trains. Please also consider doing the
same for the R line, which runs so seldom it's not worth taking.
Yes please! Too many of us have had to be late for work or college classes due to random missing scheduled
rides or trams being ridiculously late!

I look forward to faster service and the return to downtown.

New temporary schedule now. Your riders won't wait till January. The drop in ridership won't bounce back unless
RTD is actually communicating about the schedule. "Delays up to 30 minutes" when you know where and how
long the speed restrictions are is unacceptable
I can't wait till all the lightrail trains are back running every 15 minutes. I've been so frustrated with the slow downs
and cancelation. It's been a hassle to get anywhere under 2 hours if you're using the train.
This would be GREAT!!!! thanks 🤞
Please reinstate 15-minute service frequency! This will drastically improve the commute experience of H Line
riders.
Any improvements to service on this route are a benefit to commuters. I would hope it increases ridership. While I
do not use RTD frequently, it is a good way to get into the city without driving.
RTD will never be able to maintain the every 15 minute schedule. RTD is currently unable to maintain the every
30 minute schedule. This will just have passengers stranded due to cancellations. Also the speed restrictions
seem to be permanent, but RTD will not accommodate them in the schedule. I used to use the H line, it is so
unreliable now I can’t use it to get to work.
H line should never be less than 15 minute intervals, I understand alot of students use this route but so do a lot of
professionals so reducing it to 1 hour every summer makes it impossible to use. With denver becoming
increasingly more expensive, professionals are moving to Aurora more and more and this train line is crucial to
serving those people and getting them downtown. Back to 15 minutes is something that should never change
This change will give ease to many college students who use the H line to get to and from class everyday. Less
wait times can allow for more time to be dedicated to school work.
This directly serves our office bldg. Greater frequency and reliability may improve usage and demand of RTD rail
services by employees. We are looking to renew our RTD Eco pass but employees don't use it much as its
unreliable and there are not many trips offered.
I haven’t taken the H line (which is my main line) for 3 months due to the timing of the line and required transfer
heading north on the R line. I would return to taking the light rail with the service increase.
I use the H line often. I am 73. The wait time this past 10 months has been almost inhumane. How about shorter
trains and more frequent service.
PLEASE increase it to 15 minute frequency. This would help so much. Thank you very much.
Again.... It will be positive if the trains will run on schedule, but that has not been the case for some time. The H
has been so bad for months. Incredibly late trains and dropped trips are the norm, often with no notifications or
Service Alerts being sent. Will this change actually increase the likelihood of trains running on time?

I am a student that commutes to my University everyday. Sometimes I have 8 am classes that are in person. I
really appreciate H line as it helps me get to my school in a timely manner. Although an issue I have been running
into is the fact that there are cancellations which therein has me late to class. I know there has been some
change on what frequency works, it would be beneficial to know just the reliability that my train won't get
cancelled. As a student I really enjoy your new Youth Pass initiative, it has changed many lives including mine.
Thank you for all you do RTD!
The H line frequency was going to be increased from 15 min intervals to now remaining at 30 min intervals.
Please add a train that gets downtown to 18th & Cal that “arrives” at 6:57 AM! It’s insane that every :27 & :57 after
the hour have an arrival except 6:57 AM. Does RTD not think that people start work at 7 AM downtown? Because
of the unreliability of the schedules it is not efficient to take the E line and connect to the D line at Broadway since
the E is never on time as well. Thank you!
The H line is the easiest way to currently get to aurora for me by rail. The H line staying at 30-minute frequencies I
feel will hurt the aurora and the southeast corridor. I'm just wondering when the 15-minute frequency will be
added back to the H line.
The trains are currently running 20-30 min late. Some of the earlier morning trains simply get skipped, and two
will come in succession within 10 minutes. It’s super hard to estimate when the train will come and accordingly
come to the station on time, I usually end up sitting at the station for 20-30 minutes.
I know you’re short staffed so you can’t really do much but we would love some consistency on times. Every 30
minutes works fine and I would even settle back to the every hour one but so many of my trains get cancelled
randomly with no warning. This really sucks because it’s made me late to classes which I really can’t afford
anymore, and I don’t have time to show up at the station two hours before hand just in case the train gets delayed
again. The H line also needs more carts, even one more would make a huge difference. It’s one of the most
popular college lines and is constantly overflowing with people.
I used to take the H line daily. However, when the schedule was reduced and then the reliability of the E line
showing up on time became nonexistent, I could no longer count on the H line to get to/from downtown, so I
ended up purchasing a vehicle instead, which puts additional vehicles on our already crowded roads!
The schedules should be adjusted to better reflect delays please!
Please bring back the H Line every 15 minutes!
I use to take this line to work and home every day. However, it’s been so bad that I had to find alternative routes
to get to work and home. They are not running according to the schedule posted. Sometimes, I would be waiting
almost an hour for one. It use to be 45 minute commute. Now its almost two hours to commute. I understand the
slow zones and construction is necessary. But for no train to be running is insane. I have only seen the D Line
and E Line running more consistently. The H line serves a lot of students and people who need it to commute to
downtown. The 30 minute intervals were a good start after the construction was done. However, it has not been
happening. It is more like every hour or two. If it cant go back to being every 15 minutes, that’s fine. Please find a
way for it to at least follow the 30 minute. I appreciate RTD and for it getting me places where I need to be. I am
just hoping the H Line can improve.

Finally!!!

These lines are so important for my commute and seeing family. The 15-minute frequency would reduce my wait
time.
Could you let me know if the speed restrictions will be lifted?
Thank you, increased frequency is very helpful for me and my family!
More frequent stop times mean the trains are actually useable
RTD can do a better job of running a few extra trains after big events (coors field, ball arena, empower) to help
encourage more transit. Sometimes I have to wait 30-40 minutes for a train after an avalanche or nuggets game.
Same for leaving a Rockies game. If a night game ends after walking to Union Station it’s a 30’ minute wait if I’m
lucky. I can usually take D,E, or H trains back to my stop at Alameda station. But others don’t take the train
specifically because it takes too long to get home from events.
Increased frequency is always good!
I’ll be able to ride to MSU for classes reliably again. The unreliability that came with 30 minute made me drive
instead.
15 minute frequency is the absolute minimum to make this route rideable to the general public.
Please follow-through with re-instating 15-minute service frequency on this rail line. I really want to use the train to
commute downtown, but with current level of service and unreliability of schedule with the derated tracks and
slow zones it can be unusable and often leads to me adding to traffic on I-25.
Shut down lines for a temporary amount of time so work can be focused on fixing the slow zones. Have a bus
transport people while the maintenance is ongoing. Hire outside contractors to facilitate the process of
maintenance on the tracks
It's unclear to me if this change also means that the horrible slow speed zones will end. If they do end, then this
service change will really help me in my commute to downtown Denver. I hate driving there, and the H Line is
very close to my home. The more frequent trains make it easier for me to use the H Line to get to weekly
community events I attend.
I'm excited that you're moving back to 15 minute intervals, at least on paper. But I'm extremely skeptical that it can
actually be implemented, given that there are cancelations almost every single day due to no drivers being
available. I'd rather have less service that is 100% reliable, than have more service that is only 25% reliable. You
are losing longtime customers like me who have reverted back to driving into downtown because of how
unreliable the H line schedule is. I can only take lightrail when my arrival time is unimportant. Rush hour traffic on
I-25 has become more reliable when I need to be on time.

I think it would be amazing to increase frequency and also the SPEED pls it should not be taking me ONE HOUR
to get from illif station to colfax at auraria not only that but instead of focusing on changes in Jan 2025 you should
be fixing the unreliability of the H line now because I rely on it every single day and yet half of the time it’s over 1
hour late, 4 schedules H line trains just don’t even show up and that is a big problem because I have stuff to do
and places to be yet I can’t because the H line is
and never on time it’s always always late and not even by
15 minutes no no it’s ONE HOUR LATE and that is unacceptable you cannot promise what you can’t keep like not
only me but other people rely on this h line for work now what are they supposed to tell their bosses oh the train
took over an hour no that’s not a reasonable excuse especially with the amount of times it’s been happening
recently just absolutely unacceptable and this must be fixed as soon as possible
This will make me use the lightrail again
FREAKIN FINALLY. Trains that run on time? Yes please.
Same as for e line. E and h are the lines I use most. I can use them to get to work but with the long headways it’s
been impossible. I also use them to get to the a train or the express airport busses and shorter headways would
make it so I can use the train again and not have to park at the airport where spots often fill up
Would make it much easier to opt not to drive.
Thank you for decreasing wait times!
15 minute frequency on the E & H Lines will be a profound improvement. But scheduled frequency means nothing
without reliability. Since the September service changes, both the E & H lines moved to 30 minute frequency, but I
find they are just as unreliable as over the summer. Trains are regularly cancelled and frequently very late. The
real time tracking is often inaccurate, when it’s available at all. I want frequent service, but I need service I can
rely on.
The 30-minute service frequency on the H Line makes commuting between DTC (where I live) and the downtown
business district (where I work) extremely challenging. I strongly prefer riding the train to driving, but it is difficult to
justify doing so when I cannot reliably connect from the D or H Line to the E Line without getting stranded at a
station for up to 30 minutes (or, god forbid, up to an hour if a trip is canceled). Restoring 15-minute headways
would give me a lot more confidence that I can get from home to work and back without wasting a huge chunk of
my day waiting for a train to arrive.
On days where the D Line is down/experiencing disruptions or station closures, the H Line becomes my go-to
choice. However, that becomes everyone else's choice too, and the trains get to be incredibly packed. There have
been times where I have not been able to physically get onto the train because there are so many people on
board. Hopefully the increased frequency will alleviate that.
We chose our living location based upon these frequent headways on these H/E lines. It's important that they are
being restored.

E/H line are both routes I typically take for work, though not for the last couple years due to the slow zones, route
repairs, and even more so the lack of drivers to properly staff all the trains. I am super excited to see these guys
going back to their normal schedule, but I am also very nervous that the slow zones and driver shorter may still be
a big impact in Jan 2025. Can you keep up the communication so we had have the most up to date status news
going into 2025 for this transition!
I am an eager watcher on the slow zone maps as they improve, but so far the E/H slow zones near me have not
made any improvements yet.
Should be 5-10 minutes.
I think it is a mistake to increase frequencies on the E and H lines again until RTD has enough operators to
consistently operate all scheduled light rail services. Even at the current 30 minute frequencies, services are
routinely being cancelled due to the operator shortage, and these cancellations often mean that it is just easier to
take a few buses rather than waiting to see if the light rail service will actually show up or not. The frequencies
should stay where they are until there are enough operators to consistently operate the scheduled service.
Restoring service to 15 minute intervals is a huge step in the right direction. Once the slowdowns are corrected, I
hope RTD can begin to restore trust in the consistency of service to the these parts of the metro.
Yes, 15 minutes or less headways should be the standard.
Same as E line
You need to reinstate the 15 minute intervals as people rely on your service for employment. You are public
transport but you act like you just a just there for tax money. People rely on your service and you continue to drop
the ball
Again faster trains more important than more service.
Increase reliability - I take the train from the Auraria station and sometimes it doesn’t even come or it’s 30-40 mins
late
Would be helpful for students
I am looking forward to the train to be back on regular schedule
The shorter wait times and more consistent service would be great!
I appreciate the service increase, I take the E/H from 10th & Osage to Southmoor every day for work this would
benefit me a lot. I hope there is enough staff to implement this successfully without lots of canceled trains as
reliability is as important as frequency. Also please ensure Google Maps real-time info is accurate.
More frequent trains are essential.
I use the train exclusively to get to work and 15 minute intervals fits this need much better.

Can you please use the same light rail schedule that was in effect before the shutdown of the D Line that started
in May 2024 that lasted through September 2024? I take the 402L bus to the Mineral station and the light rail
schedule that was in effect prior to May 2024 worked really well with the arrival and departure time of the 402L.
Now, if the 402L is just a few minutes late to arrive to the Mineral station, I will have to wait 15 minutes for the next
light rail train. For example, I take the 402L that is scheduled to arrive at Mineral station at 8:14 with the D Line
leaving at 8:18. If the 402L is late by just 2 minutes, that will not provide me enough time to walk from the bus
stop, walk the bridge over Santa Fe and then down to the light rail. I would then have to wait until 8:33 for the next
light rail and that causes me to be an additional 15 minutes late for work. Prior to May 2024, I think there was a
light rail that left Mineral station around the 8:20 or so mark -- that worked really well if the 402L was running late.
It feels like the scheduling of the light rail does not always take into consideration that some riders have
connecting buses and the departure times of the light rail do not line up very well. Thank you.
I'll believe your
trains will be on time when I see it happen. You're just gonna cancel every other
like you do now so who gives a flying
?
There is not enough information about what the proposed change is. Please provide more information
Please bring back the C Line from Littleton to Union Station!
I really appreciate the light rail from Littleton to downtown. I miss having the C Line that would take me directly
from Littleton to Union Station, but understand Covid changed everything and the frequency of riders has to be
taken into account. That being said, I like that the D line is also very convenient and only minor changes to the
schedule are appreciated.
Would really like to see more predictable, on time service for this line.
Also appreciate the route moving back to its usual route instead of Union station
This would be beneficial to all the commuters and students from Auraria Campis. Thank you!!
please keep D at union station..much better and more direct connections...at least at some times and/or reinstate
C
You keep cutting/ eliminating train schedules what used to be a 45 minute commute before the pandemic is now
over an hour. My options to get from Englewood to Downtown went from about 5 options between D and C lines
to 2 D line options now. Bring the C and F line back....you would have more riders
You need to post a temporary schedule between now and January. RTD is unreasonably unreliable with the
posted schedules being wrong for 4 months due to speed restrictions
I can't wait till all the lightrail trains are back running every 15 minutes. I've been so frustrated with the slow downs
and cancelation. It's been a hassle to get anywhere under 2 hours if you're using the train.
This directly serves our office bldg. Greater frequency and reliability may improve usage and demand of RTD rail
services by employees. We are looking to renew our RTD Eco pass but employees don't use it much as its
unreliable and there are not many trips offered.

15 minute timing needs to be reinstated for this line too! Increasing the frequency of trains from the east side of
town leaves a significant amount of riders in a lurch

Please add back an earlier morning train, about six months ago there was like a 4:19 am from Mineral, then a
4:49 am and 5:19 am or something close to that. Now the earliest train is 5:19 and with the incredibly long and
timely slow zones we cannot make it to work by 6 am
Well your changes outlined are very vague, but I know that how slowly D line has been moving has made me late
many times. So I hope the timing improves and gets faster and that you stop skipping trains mid morning.
Your service from Spring to now has been unreliable and made my day longer every day I take the train. Union
Station was terrible. My commute was 1.5 hours of transportation, sitting on a train and then bus. Waiting for a
train or bus times included. Months of this to be told everything would be normal in late September. We still have
unreliable trains that make the train ride 60-90 minutes. When will it end?!
No idea. It says that it’s minor changes but doesn’t say what the changes actually are.
The schedules should be adjusted to better reflect delays please!
D line needs to 1) match up with the E line for Union station both north and south.
Or 2) periodically change to Mineral Station to Union station
There are many of us , seniors , who find it difficult to access DIA via light rail due to C line being discontinued,
and the in effective scheduling of the E line.
Waiting 20 minutes at Broadway Station is not useful. Especially in late hours or during inclement weather.
We need a 0530am departure from Mineral to 18th and California.
Proposed departure times:
0515
0530
0545
Having a 30 minute gap (as it is now) is really ridiculous for prime rider times.
Please bring back the C line. Also, don't drop down to every 30 mins until after 9
Now the current schedule is meaningless. We need a reliable schedule. Also, more frequent trains after 9PM are
needed for travel from the Theater district after concerts and plays.
Just last nite, after an enjoyable downtown D line was VERY LATE.
NOT ON SCHEDULE..
An improvement in time is good

I believe that by improving on time performance, for this line and others, will have both a positive impact on me
and other commuters. Recently RTD has been extremely lacking with both communication and on time
performance which has been super difficult for me as a commuting student. By making sure that the on time
improvements will actually be implemented and followed this will impact me as someone who uses the online
schedule and I can actually trust the times posted instead of just winging it. I also hope that the speed restrictions
are lifted soon as 1. Operators are inconsistent about where the speed restrictions are and a lot of the time they
will go slow when they don’t have to 2. The scheduled times are false and it takes WAYYY more then 38 minutes
to get from the Mineral to Colfax at Auraria. Recently it took me 1hr and 30mins. Which is absolutely absurd. I
believe that these issues also impact your ability to arrive on time. Please make changes, please do better,
please do the needful. I really believe that public transportation is extremely beneficial for many people and it is
more then disheartening that all of this has been handled so poorly.
This statement offers no meaningful information to judge off of. What I do know is that the D Line has been an
unacceptably unreliable service. Between slowdowns, trains that show on the app but never show or pass
through as “out of service” despite only running twice and hour anyway, leaving folks sitting in unsafe areas for an
hour or more at a time.
Improving on time performance is a necessity and a bare minimum of a transit system that every citizen is paying
tax into.
Please have an option to get all the way from Littleton mineral to union station with just light rail!
I need to be to work at 5am, you no longer have the D line leaving mineral for Denver at 415am. How am I to get
to work by 5am on 1505 w 3rd .
RTD can do a better job of running a few extra trains after big events (coors field, ball arena, empower) to help
encourage more transit. Sometimes I have to wait 30-40 minutes for a train after an avalanche or nuggets game.
Same for leaving a Rockies game. If a night game ends after walking to Union Station it’s a 30’ minute wait if I’m
lucky. I can usually take D,E, or H trains back to my stop at Alameda station. But others don’t take the train
specifically because it takes too long to get home from events.
The current schedule is not reliable and limits the number of options for me to get to and from work within a
reasonable amount of time. Your minor adjustment of time, which isn't known at this time to your riders, could
cause problems since I only have one slightly reasonable option to get to work on time as of now. I am afraid to
see your changes because it will mean l have to leave earlier just to ensure I get to work on time. Post the new
schedule times BEFORE they go into effect
I think tweaking the timing of the D line has potential to noticeably improve service. But what I would really like is
the return of the C line. It was great for me when the D line was running to DUS, like the C line used to, because I
didn't have to transfer to a different line. I know there's a lot of overlap between them, but it would be a great
reason to increase frequency (whichwould help a lot on days with large events), and it would minimize the
number of transfers for people like me.
The current 10 MPH for 4 stations is awful and no news on how long it will be in place.

Shut down the D line for say 2 weeks, focus all efforts to fix the track issues so that the trains can go back to
intended frequency, and slow zones can be lifted. Hire outside contractors if needed to help the process. Add bus
connections between the stations to help any who absolutely need service between the stations
Without details on what those change will be it is difficult to comment. But I assume it will be positive. I think that
bringing back the C line will be more beneficial.
Please fix the speed issues for the D Lone all lines actually. It impacts everyone’s quality of life. If you can’t then
driving downtown is going to become the norm.
Hopefully, there will be earlier trains like there used to be starting around 4 am going downtown Denver from
Littleton.
Summer service was literally garbage. Had to spend $100s of dollars on Uber to GET TO WORK ON TIME
BECAUSE RTD CAN'T GET A ROUTE TOGETHER. THIS IS RIDICULOUS YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF
YOURSELVES. Seriously this is the worst public transit mess I've ever seen. Do you people even ever TRY to
use these routes to get anywhere ON TIME? We're not all going for a fun day at a Rockies game, some of us
have bills to pay. Thanks for making 2 hours of my check per day useless. Keep up the subpar work RTD. This is
why no one uses the trains. Trash.
FREAKIN FINALLY. Trains that run on time? Yes please.
The D line needs to arrive at Englewood station so that riders who then need to catch a 0 to Highlands Ranch are
not waiting for 30 minutes.
On that note the 0 should have 15 minute headway between Highlands Ranch and Englewood station and 7
minute headway between Englewood station and downtown.
An improvement in on-time performance of the D Line is something that really matters to me. I am very excited to
see this proposed change!
Please bring back the C line service to Union Station. Increased service intervals for the D line are appreciated,
but my community would rather have both C and D line service from Mineral Station instead. Transfering trains to
Union Station has also become practically impossible due to service delays and cancelations associated with the
construction.
It was actually more beneficial for me when the D Line was re-routed to Union Station. Granted I can still do so
with the E Line, but that requires me to make a transfer.
Thank you for providing more service, including longer availability during the day and more frequency, to make
taking transit a more convenient option.

The timing for the train definitely needs to improve. The times posted at the train stop and online are not reliable
Restoring service to 15 minute intervals is a huge step in the right direction. Once the slowdowns are corrected, I
hope RTD can begin to restore trust in the consistency of service to the these parts of the metro.
More reliable service would be great
Bring back the c line, for avoiding 2 transfers to the airport, plus when there are sporting events. Also, please fix
the tracks soon, so trains go faster than 5 mph. I used to religiously use RTD for 20 years, but now opt to drive.
Sad.
Please restore service from Littleton to Union Station
I work at the Concention center and sometimes the downtown hotels. Since last spring the service has been
terrible. Cancellations and of course, the summer maintenance continuing into fall. These delays and
cancellations need to cease in order to provide a service on which riders relay. Must be every 15 minutes during
working hours. Until resolution I will continue to car pool with my coworkers. #dobetter
I would like more detail on these proposed changes. What times will the D line be departing the Mineral station in
the morning? I used to catch the 5:42am train but that no longer exists. The trains just get later and later which
has caused me to have to shift my work hours and get stuck on a packed train with college students in the
afternoon. If you want commuters to take the train have early trains. Please send me or publish the proposed
schedules.
Says the train not running on time. I have to spend my money on Uber. That’s ridiculous in the first train Oxford
station leaving at 5:26. We need to try a little bit early. Everybody needs to go to work.
Anything that can make the trains run on time is needed
Trains and trams are suppose to be as fast to get to places with a car if not faster with safety as a priority
obviously but going 5Miles an hour is not either fast or safe I be late to my classes usually because of this train
and downtown has limited parking for me to drive to my school it was way better and way faster back in Fall of
2023 but with how slow this tram/train goes it’s just unacceptable I’ve never showed up once and the train was
here on time it’s either 10pm late or 10pm early and with winter coming it’s going to be so much worse to be
waiting outside in the cold
This would be great to have!!
Please run the D line trains every ten minutes at least.

Don't know about this change, but reverting the line back to 18th and California from Mineral is going to adversly
effect my use of RTD. The wait to connect with a train at Broadway, to go to Union Station, is way too long
(usually almost 25 minutes). I took the train much more when it went directly to Union Station for the past few
months.

I hate this route. It’s always late going to Denver in the morning and coming home. The bus spends way too much
time in Lafayette and the bus drivers take their sweet time getting to stops. Most nights I miss my connecting bus
at 8th & Briss because the driver has no idea where they’re going or they drive extra slow. Do something - change
the route so the bus goes down Longs Peak in the evening. Remind the drivers not everyone drives to the bus
stop. People need to make their connections and way too much time is wasted to make this an effective
commuter route.
If I had a car, I’d drive to Broomfield to catch the bus. That’s how much the LD1 sucks.
A very exciting addition, thank you for the increase in additional trips.
I have been hoping for additional service on this line for almost a year! Very much looking forward to this service

This is the slow route to Denver. Most days (in good weather) it takes me 2 hours to get to work one way. Please
give us back our express route b/w Longmont & Denver. I’m so tired of crawling through Lafayette & Broomfield
just to get to downtown.
THANK YOU!!! This is such welcome news and I greatly look forward to seeing these approved and having more
options to get to/from Lafayette. I so appreciate this, and hope to see even more in the future (and maybe some
weekend options)?
I would definitely benefit from having more time options for the LD1, especially if there’s an LD option for the
weekend
much potential for inc freq
I’d me more interested in specific times for this service increase as I currently commute from Longmont to
Highlands Ranch and by the time I get to Union Station, the LD1 has left an hour earlier.
Longmont-Denver needs trips for SUNDAY. Not kidding. Making Longmont from Union Station on Sunday can
take you 2 hours and 30 minutes. You have to go to Boulder, and then, Bolt raids once per hour (which is fair).
I would definitely use LD1 on Sundays, since I need to go to Longmont quite often, and Sundays are a day which
am normally off.
Infrequent current service levels means LD1 is not a viable option for travel to Denver
I believe the LD route should operate every 30 minutes from morning until mid afternoon. I do commute and use
this route to see Doctors and specialists in longmont
It's really going to depend on timing. Right now, the later one in the morning is getting me to work a little late, so if
you could make one earlier that would be fantastic! I would also like to see LD1s that ran a little later in the
evening as well. It would definitely help with my commute.
Add weekend buses. Particularly evening and night for Longmont residents who would like to see a show
downtown.
Or just build the train that voters approved and which you are legally required to deliver. We have been waiting so
long for the thing that other train lines (THAT WE HELPED TO FUND!) need repairs now. Longmont, Lafayette,
Erie, Niwot, Louisville, Superior, and Boulder would love to see any real action from RTD, make Parker and
Golden pay for ours like we paid for theirs.

I live in Lafayette, Longmont has almost daily events and lots of fun weekend events, so I look forward to being
able to stay and enjoy all the fun offerings there. Currently, I rarely go there because of the bus service, but with
these improvement, I will defintiely take advantage. Also, have family members who prefer taking the bus there

LD from Longmont to Denver is a must have route for commuters working in the Longmont area going to Denver
and back again.
Please add rides from union station to Longmont in the morning on weekdays as It helps people travelling from
Denver to Longmont.
First of all thank you for not cutting off the LD1 at Broomfield park-and-ride. Secondly, thank you for adding
service to this route. Instead of adding additional LD1s, my suggestion is to bring the LD2 back to avoid the
significant running time loss that happens when the LD1 goes through city of Lafayette. My guess is that the
majority of your boardings are happening in Longmont and you’d be likely to get even more if you had more direct
route between Longmont and Denver. Again thanks for continuing to work on bringing service back to prepandemic levels and considering this suggestion.
With the changes I believe the LD1 would be more efficient with timing as the 7 am one in Lafayette is often late.
The bus is often packed in the morning and afternoon and these changes might assist with allowing more
flexibility for certain riders.
I would use this route if it ran more reliably on the weekends.
I commute from Broomfield Station to Union Station, and would LOVE additional bus options. The LD1 is always
very full when I ride .
Need even more frequency
The Broomfield station has more housing being built with residents wanting access to routes to Denver. This will
be great for helping manage the increased demand from this area
I just moved north to Lafayette this summer and I was ELATED to see a bus that goes to Union Station from up
this way. I was a little disappointed when I saw only two morning and two evening weekday options - especially
with all the delays to the E line this summer (which I connect to). I do hope service is being added later in the day.
The 5:21 last train north is much too early for those of us who don't work downtown (I work in DTC). I can handle
waiting for the next bus but not having to get an Uber for a daily work commute.
PLEASE BRING BACK THE LX. The commute time on the local route is too long, and is a terrible burden for work
schedules and those of us with school aged children, or one car per household.
Traffic is bad on this street and I support bringing more bus transit to keep the roads moving!
The current LD1 schedule forces me to drive to Broomfield for the FF1. Hopefully this service increase will allow
me to use the LD1 from Lafayette.

The amount of service Longmont receives compared with the amount of money we have given RTD is ridiculous.
It is an absolute fiasco trying to get to the airport or Union Station from Longmont and it should not be. We need
reliable service at 15 minute intervals. Also, we want our train. Also, RTD needs a CEO who uses public transport
daily.

1) This route connects multiple suburbs to each other and to Denver
2) Increased frequency equals improved convenience which is what is required to improve ridership, NOT the
other way around
3) This route and improved convenience will further alleviate car traffic for those who still want or need to drive
4) The economic impact is also great with increased traffic through Longmont, Lafayette, Broomfield, and Denver
which will be further improved with the future extension of the W Line.
I live in Denver (moving to Arvada) and work in Longmont and there is never a bus available when I need to go to
work or return home (normal business hours)
The more one-seat trips between Denver and Longmont, the better! This is a very welcome change, now my
friends in Longmont could have a more reliable commute to and from Auraria, and for me personally it makes it
easier to visit friends and family in Longmont
It’s hard to say if this proposed change is positive or not without knowing the exact timing of the proposed
schedule. The newest change now arrives at Union Station around 7:55 am, which is too late to get to work on
time. A route that arrives to Union Station around 7:35 am (reliably) and leaves at 5:30 pm would allow
commuters who need to work a full day in Denver to use the service. More evening options would allow people to
go to an event in Denver and still be able to get back home
Thank you for the additional times. The best scenario for me (and several other riders I have spoken with) is
bringing back an express route that hits interstate quickly rather than meandering through Lafayette and
Broomfield.
My request is re-open again LD1 in the mornings at 7 am it was working really good before pandemic... After
pandemic it was closed .... Thanks
As a one car family, when I need to go to Denver my choice is to take the bus to Boulder, get a ride to Table
Mesa, or get a ride to Niwot Rd/287 for the LD. I rarely am taking the latter as the current schedule is far too
limiting. More service on this route would give me more options in my travel.
I am very pleased to hear about additional trips on the LD1! I travel between Denver and Longmont a lot, and the
LD1 is the fastest and easiest way to travel between the two cities by a landslide, and I wish it ran more, so I am
glad it is getting this service change.

Thank you for thinking to add these route times! I live in Denver but work in Boulder. I take the FF5 in the morning

This is a great route and I love the expansion of EB buses in the afternoon. Thanks for helping get us where we

We don’t need a later bus from Boulder to Anschutz. We need another morning bus from Boulder to Anschutz and
another late afternoon bus back to Boulder. I use this bus to commute to work and the times were much more
convenient bf Covid
Adding a 3:02 and 4:02 eastbound time to FF5 could cut my commute in half. I commute from Aurora to Boulder
for work, and I currently have to take FF1 or FF2 because none of the FF5 times are late enough for me to come
back on, which makes my commute long by having to get to Union Station first. These service changes could help
many people in my situation I think.

Again - please bring back the FF line that provides service along the 36 corridor to the civic center station. It
would make my commute 20 min faster and so much more pleasant!
Please re-open Boulder Junction station and re-start service from there. That area is very poorly served by public
transit, and I would be able to use RTD transit much easier if it was open.
The FF5 really needs to run more often for people going to and from the hospital zone in Anschutz.
It would be wonderful to bring back the FF6 express route from Boulder going east. The FF1 routes are PACKED
after work hours and don’t serve parts of Boulder commuters who work east of CU Boulder. The FF6 was a great
option to bypass all the stops FF1 makes and alleviate how many people are crammed into the FF1.
some additional morning routes eastbound would help me more.
Please increase the number of Westbound afternoon trips and add another trip later than 5 (ie 6pm trip as there
was before COVID)
Please add a bus that arrives at the hospital at 8 so those of us working standard shifts can actually use the bus
instead of driving. There are plenty of afternoon return options.
Hi! I have been taking the FF5 to and from work every day for the past 4 years. I love this route and was excited
that times were being added but am confused about what was added. I do not know who would be able to use
these new times, going Eastbound in the afternoon. How would they get back? There is 1 bus going west bound
in the morning, which has never made sense, and that still doesn't make sense. What we really need are more
times going WESTbound in the afternoon. On some days it is almost standing room only. A 4:45 and/or 5:45 bus
going westbound would make the most sense to me.
More routes please
FF5 would be a great way to for people with CU health insurance to get to Anschutz, but the frequency has to be
often enough and dependable enough for me to give up driving my car. Right now it's not.
Having access to usable transit options requires that transit to come at a rate where it is useful to many groups of
people and more time options is an essential part of that. It is difficult to catch a transit option that does not come
frequently as the time may not work for many people's schedules. Adding increased service frequency is vital to
many transit users in making lines actually usable for them.
Traffic is bad on this street and I support bringing more bus transit to keep the roads moving!
I’m excited to have more options for when I can commute from Boulder!

Attachment: Proposed January 2025 Service Change Survey Results 11.4.24 (5028 : January 2025 Service Change)

It would be nice to eventually add another eastbound trip (or move up the current trip that arrives just before 9)
that can reliably get to 17th pl and aurora (where most of the passengers get off) around 10 minutes before 9 AM
even with traffic. This would let a lot of us get into our offices and join meetings/classes on time and without
having to rush like we do now.

Thank you for providing more service, including longer availability during the day and more frequency, to make
taking transit a more convenient option.
1) This route connects employees and a vital service to the Boulder community, along with people residing around
the Anschutz campus who may want to travel to Boulder
2) Increased frequency equals improved convenience which is what is required to improve ridership, NOT the
other way around
3) This route and improved convenience will further alleviate car traffic
Hello. There was no option to select: please bring back the FF4. There are dozens of coworkers at my office
including myself that would use it to get to Boulder from Denver. The Transit center in Boulder Junction has now
be closed for over 4 years.
Like the added service as need is growing from campus to Boulder
Well, I'm just using the FF5 change as a way to offer a comment on the FF2 -- which is not changing, alas. It
remains extremely annoying that after spending $250M, and opening the express lanes for buses with huge
fanfare, those lanes are essentially not used by RTD except for a few buses each day. Long past time to run more
FF2 buses -- the last times I got a chance to use them they were quite full -- and also to re-open the now-closed
terminal at Boulder Junction and run some FF2 buses which start/end there as well.
I am writing to provide feedback on the absence of proposed RTD service changes to the FF2. I commute from
Union Station to Boulder-Broadway/Euclid Monday-Friday and take the FF1 because the FF2 is not offering
routes that arrive by/before 8:00am in Boulder. Between this summer and fall, during my commute, most FF1
buses I have taken are standing room only and most buses from Union Station to Boulder run out of room for
bicycles by US36/Wadsworth. Given this tremendously high demand for FF1 and FF2 buses during peak
commuting hours (arriving in Boulder by 8:00am and departing Boulder by 5:15pm), I want to urge RTD to
consider adding additional FF2 routes to support the high demand for ridership. Adding additional FF2 routes
during peak commuting hours (arriving in Boulder by 8:00am and departing Boulder by 5:15pm) would free up
room on the FF1 buses for travelers who are picking up the bus after Union Station west-bound and free up room
on the FF1 buses east-bound for travelers not going directly to Union Station. While I am happy to see RTD is
increasing the frequency of FF5 buses, I urge them to reconsider adding more frequent FF2 service.

I am a nurse practitioner at Children’s Hospital Colorado and my commute is exhausting. It would be so incredibly
helpful if the FF5 ran later and left Anschutz at 7 and 8pm as well- so many of us healthcare workers work 12
hour shifts that end at 7pm, and by the time we sign out to the rest of the medical team it’s often 8pm.

I’ll be using this bus on a weekday during winter and I support more service on it.
As a ski instructor at eldora I do not trust the consistency of the bus schedule. Many times the bus drives by my
stop and I am unsure to whether another one will be coming, sometimes one comes & sometimes an additional
one does come. The bus schedule has made me late which forces me to loose all the $ that I would’ve made in a
day as if I’m late then I loose the lesson for that day. Also the schedule does not align with employee start times. I
have to be at work at 8:45am but the bus does not arrive till 9:02 or 9:52. These erratic times have made me get
in trouble at work and made me loose valuable income. A more consistent bus schedule as well as providing
additional buses when buses are full would allow me to actually use the bus system as opposed to having to drive
my own vehicle.

I usually drive to Eldora, but I occasionally take the NB1. I’d take it more often if there were more frequent buses
scheduled, and if there was a stronger guarantee that the buses would adhere to the posted schedule. I
remember reading about skiers who were stranded at Eldora after the NB1 return service was unexpectedly
canceled for the day during a previous season.
More frequent busses are really crucial. I have never been on the bus where it wasn't completely full (including
the isle filled with standing people). There is so much demand on weekends and it is so predictable.
Provide more insight into this timing. Similar to the airport route, this bus is often overful, which dissuades people
from using. More buses at peak times are needed.
Sometimes I take this to Eldora but when you have to wait 45 extra minutes for another bus if the first one fills up,
and then it's stressful at Eldora to get back to Boulder, this inhibits transit usage.
The weekday timing doesn't do much for me, but running to/from Eldora every hour on the weekends would be
great.
I was really excited when this bus line started, but I ended up never taking it after hearing about riders being
stranded at Eldora and told to find their own way home. If this is within the bounds of acceptable to RTD, how is it
communicated to everyday riders? Are there warning signed on or outside the bus?
So, the most recent change was considered minor and meant to better match rider demand. It is/does neither for
students. I don't have enough info/specific timing to comment meaningfully on the next purposed - except to say it
can't come soon enough. Please restore an option that gets mountain kids to Boulder closer to the school start
time - 8:30 and provides a ride home - that isn't after 6 pm. Thank you very much. And, we have ecopasses - so
we are good either way but I think providing youth free rides is really good thing.
Please add hourly buses eastbound around 7am, 8 am & 9am for commuters.
And hourly buses westbound around 4pm, 5pm & 6pm
Please support us riding NB to and from work at pre pandemic service levels rather than adding to traffic with
drivers who can’t make current limited bus schedule coordinate with their work shift schedule
I love the NB1 and NB2, so if you're increasing frequency that's a win in my book. I love taking day trips to
Nederland and intend to use the NB frequently this upcoming ski season.

Attachment: Proposed January 2025 Service Change Survey Results 11.4.24 (5028 : January 2025 Service Change)

I use this route twice per year and find it suits my needs. If it were a little more frequent and more protected by its

Please make the 15 and other buses run past midnight like they used to before COVID.
Any Changes to RTE 15 is hard.
Thank you for this route. Very convenient.
This is not the forum, but I feel that riders need clarity on where all the new stops will be during the construction
on East Colfax, and when existing stops are phased out in favor of new BRT stations
how long will this signal work possibly take? Will it still be an issue in April?
My main concern is that serve the 13th & Lisbon stop should be served by the 15l to allow more space other then
that keep the times the same as the current schedule

Thank you for extending the hours of this bus route, allowing additional flexibility to travelers along this line.
Route 24 buses should start from 40th & Colorado Station 3 minutes after the arrival of eastbound A Line trains
and 4 minutes after the arrival of westbound A Line trains. Suggested time: xx:09 past the hour.
I would also request that you return to having the bus every 30 minutes too.
This will finally allow a direct trip in the evenings without going through and transferring downtown, especially
during cold season! Whew
Hi, and thank you for making these improvements.
I am glad that coverage is increasing, but I would also like to see greater frequency/reduced headway. For
context, I live in Whittier in a one-car household and go to school once a week at DU. Currently, the 24 comes too
infrequently to be a reliable way for me to take the bus even though that's my preference.

route with most potential. consider 24Z from university station north to zoo..overlay..providing 15 min service from
u station to the zoo with 24N in much needed area connections with colfax 15 and brt...long badly needed
connection
The hourly schedule for this route makes it difficult to use on a regular basis. A more frequent schedule would be
beneficial to riders.
I'm glad to see it running for more hours
I have been using the 24 to commute to work and errands for the last 11 years and is my primary mode of
transportation. I am very excited for the expanded service hours but would like to comment on the SOP
(24N/24S). I would encourage planners to reconsider the proposed 24N southern terminus (Hampden/University).
I would suggest the proposed 24N terminus continue to be C470 and University Blvd Park-N-Ride. This would
bring service frequency (30-min) back to pre-covid levels. With large employment centers (shopping districts) at
the Arapahoe, Dry Creek, and County Line intersections, I believe the proposed terminus of Hampden/University
would force many 24 users to endure an additional transfer on their way to work and errands. Additionally, if the
24N terminates at Hampden, there is a missed oppertunity to improve transfer opportunities along the 66 bus
route.
Increasing Service span without increasing midday service isn't going to have the ridership boost as it is still a
very unusable service vs the 40 or the 12.
Thanks so much for increasing these service hours. Please consider increasing the frequency as well.
This would make getting home from work a lot less sketchy because I bought a bike to do the 20 minute commute
to the next station over since the 24 stops before i’m out of work
I can use the 24 more often if this change is implemented.
When I lived near Downing St, RTD's decision to split the 12 bus route into two routes (incl. the 17) at 38th &
Blake dramatically improved service reliability. Are there any plans to split the 24 bus route at the DU light rail
station? I would be strongly in support.
One hour intervals make it impossible to use. Southbound light rail may have to wait an hour for next bus. Make it
30 minutes or 15 would be better.
RTE 24 sucks - Its too long and should be divided like RTE 15 and 16.
The split should occur at DU/ light rail/ Hwy and have more frequent trips for the north RTE 24. I can't really speak
to those traveling south from DU - but going north it does not align with a good schedule for RTE 40 etc.
Good to get more service but it would be great if it was more than every hour. Makes the transfer hairy.
Extension of hours is welcome. Increased frequency would also be helpful, even if only during selected times

While I like the increase of the number of buses in the evening, I would again suggest that buses should run
every 30 minutes instead of every 60, particularly between 40th and Colorado Station and Hampden Ave as this
would be helpful to DU students and people going to Cherry Creek Mall, and I also believe that you should have
two 24s, one that follows the route south of Hampden as you have it and the other making a turn to Englewood
Station where it would help out people in Littleton who want to go to University Blvd. I also suggest a route 25 that
runs every 60 minutes along University starting at Englewood Station and going down to C-470 University Park
and Ride, this would help give Englewood a better connection with Centennial.

The re-instated portion of the route that turns off of Hampden and onto Akron looks like it will miss two stops that
are currently fairly active on the 105 bus - Hampden/Akron and Hampden/Dayton; both of which provide access
to the nearby Walmart. Hampden/Yosemite is also a popular stop and is within .2 miles of Hampden/Akron. How
will these stops work with the 35, are there plans for consolidation of any of these stops, and is there an
advantage to routing the 35 onto Akron instead of Dayton?
Please set the old route, back up!
Thank you for bringing this back!! If it can sync up with the increased headways for the 40 that would be amazing.

This is great news for the 35 to go down to the nine mile station. It is a bad idea though to not use the frontage
road of 285 as the route for the western side of Sheridan Blvd. Not using the current route creates an
infrastructure loss since a bus will not replace that route. This creates more transfers to the 76 in order to get to
Southwest plaza. This will make the 76 more crowded than it is already
I chose the route closest to my house, but I wanted to generally thank RTD for adding service. Increasing
frequencies and providing additional hours of service across the network are the only ways to make transit a
realistic option for many people. It's clear from all of the proposed changes for 2025 that RTD is focused on
moving service in the right direction. Thank you.
Bringing this route back from Englewood to Nine Mile would be a life saver. This route was a total time saver!
Bring this route back RTD, help make lives better with public transportation that works for the public, not against
us! Please & thank you!
This depends on which hours the route is expanded. If the route is expanded during mid-to-late evenings and
weekends, I will definitely ride.
The segment east of Englewood Station to Nine Mile Station being reinstated will provide a great interconnect
between rail segements of the system and is very useful for me.
Reinstating the eastern segment of route 35 along Hampden would give people in the area better service, and
would create better opportunities for people by creating a one-seat connection from the Southeast to Englewood.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BRINGING ROUTE 35 out east! My doctor is on this route, and right now if I bus its
a 52-minute indirect trip because there is no direct route on Hampden from SE Denver to Swedish medical center
in Englewood. I am SO EXCITED TO HAVE THIS ROUTE BACK
Should never have gone away. Maybe better to break up route like you planned. Will you ever do that? Waste of a
study if not.
Thank you for providing more service, including longer availability during the day and more frequency, to make
taking transit a more convenient option.
This would be a welcome expansion for an underserved area!
This is needed, current service levels along hampden are inadequate
This bus is extremely close to my work. I would always pass by the old stops and wonder why the 35 doesn't
come by that area anymore. It would be very convenient to take this route & keep the 105 as an alternative.
This is wonderful news!! I support this change as it will benefit many residents who live east of Englewood Station
connect to rail service and other high frequency bus routes, heading both north and south. This will improve
access to employment, groceries, and medical care for many in the surrounding neighborhoods. Thank you!

I am just wondering what this service change really is. Route 83D, which operates on Quebec Way and Dayton
Street, only runs on weekday peak hours and it seems unlikely that RTD would make such a major expansion of
service including weekends. 83L already runs on 30-mibute headways 7 days a week.
This change will make it much easier for me to take the bus to work work on days when I stay at my partners
house. I really love this change and I appreciate that RTD made this change! Whatever research you did to
support this change definitely reflects my experience.
I use this route when the H line has problems, so I'm glad you are increasing frequency.
I look forward to the increased service frequency of Route 83D. Thank you for this helpful adjustment!
Thank you for providing more service, including longer availability during the day and more frequency, to make
taking transit a more convenient option.
This is a great improvement in making this heavily used transit corridor more frequent and reliable through the
day. This does a lot to make transit a competitive mode on the corridor at all times.
This would be especially valuable if it was staggered with the 83L to give 15 minute frequency on the common
portions of the routes

Please consider restoring stops out to 75th and/or through Heatherwood. Many students take this bus to school.
Anything to manage the high school riders is positive so the rest of us can still ride without feeling unwelcome.
However, I'd also like to suggest that you re-add the later service that used to exist from downtown Boulder back
to Gunbarrel, at the very least on Friday and Saturday nights, so those of us who prefer not to drive can still enjoy
events in Boulder.
If it ran more frequently, specifically during work start /end and weekend trips with the family downtown, I'd be
much more likely to consider that an option, esp during weather!

My son uses this route to/from high school
It would be great to have a policy that allowed small strollers on the bus during off hours. It is too far for a toddler
to walk from my house to the bus stop, and very cumbersome to try to get a toddler, a folded up stroller, and a
bag onto the bus.
I don't know what "tripper service" is, I wish it was explained better. Maybe then I would have said "very positive
impact."
I regularly ride the BOLT bus and have been on some very full buses with school kids riding in town. This change
could take some of the burden off of the Bolt and help improve its service speed. But I have always wondered
why the 205 and Bolt run simultaneously. If these buses were staggered, I could get the 205 if I have missed the
Bolt and have a bike as I could ride the last leg of the trip. I think with them running at the same time, some
people are just riding the comfier regional bus. LIkewise, when buses are coming in to town, if the 205 would
arrive at stops shortly but not immediately before the BOLT, it could potentially reduce the number of people
boarding the bus for in town travel

Attachment: Proposed January 2025 Service Change Survey Results 11.4.24 (5028 : January 2025 Service Change)

Service on the 205 should not be directly aligned with the Bolt. If the schedules were staggered so they left
Downtown Boulder Station at different times, the two routes would provide service every 15 minutes along
Canyon Boulevard and 28th Street. As it is now, they leave at the same time, resulting in two buses covering the
same route every 30 minutes.

Westbound route 1E/44 buses should be detoured to serve 38th & Blake Station and leave 4 minutes after the
arrival of westbound A Line trains. Suggested time: xx:33 past the hour.
The new route, currently referred to as '1E / 44' should be given the number 5.
I live in Cole, and currently the 44 line provides subpar access to upper downtown--I would rather go to 38th and
Blake and take the mall bus to access the same places I take the 44 to. However, the proposed service changes
would provide me access to Golden Triangle/Baker without transferring, and I would use this 2+ times per week to
get to amenities in those communities that I would otherwise drive to. Excited to see the SOP implemented further
with this route change!

Two problems: You have not picked a number designation for the new route (it won't be 1E/44. obviously, and
should not be, and will not be, called the Art District Connector or any other cute name). Also, you do not indicate
the frequency or span of service for the new route. If you're planning to run this route starting in January, this
information must be provided.
This is a great idea!!! We need more accessible and usable public transit in Denver, the traffic is so bad and for a
city that’s so big on environmentalism the transit system does not support that! I drive everywhere and am looking
forward to some valuable changes that will allow me a reliable way to get around Denver and surrounding areas
without relying on a car
Pending details on schedule and route, this is a very appealing idea!
I love the changes to the system, they provide a much needed North-South Connection. I do have a concern
about the route numbering. 1E/44 is not a great option and it would be much better as the 2 which hasn’t been
used since 2009 or just any number (without letters)
Based on the infprmation provided, it is unclear to me if the proposed change would positively or negativly impact
me. I currently ride the 1 from the Baker neighborhood into downtown and get off on Blake and 17th to get as
close to Union Station as possible. If the proposed changes are made, would I still be able to catch the 1 at the
Galapago and 2nd stop and get off at Blake and 17th?
This is a really cool idea for connection between the two arts districts. We frequently use the 40th & Colorado
Station for the A line and would love this service improvement. We often go to RiNo from Baker and would gladly
take public transit over rideshare services.

This route needs to be extended to 1st and Colorado Blvd, like it was before COVID, and continue to service the
Baker Neighborhood west of Broadway. Broadway is already well serviced while Baker is underserved. Even
more now that the 1 only runs once and hour.

It isn't possible to know what impact this will have without a proposed map and time tables. Surveying without that
information is sort of insulting.
The 1 is the only bus that serves my neighborhood. The best option for changes in this route would be to return to
the time (every 30 minutes) and route (all the way to Cherry Creek from Lakewood) prior to COVID.
It’s important w the weather that bus shelters are real. Strong winds fast storms waiting at stops can be terrible on
the elderly or disabled and young children/ women. The routes should never be shortened. Rerouting is
something that serves the businesses not the people who ride it.
I support the split of the 1
Love the potential connection to the 15 and 0 lines!

Attachment: Proposed January 2025 Service Change Survey Results 11.4.24 (5028 : January 2025 Service Change)

While the truncating of the line is most likely to have a positive impact, the Number 1 definitely needs more
frequent service as called for in the SOP. While it may not possible to fully implement 30 minute headways yet,
even adding 6 extra trips for rush hours (6-9 AM, 4-6 PM) would vastly help the overloaded line.

I definitely think running this route later at night would be good. I had trouble getting home, a couple of weeks

have to say that it would be nice if 38 stopped at the Ward Road park and Ride, again.

The 100 NEEDS TO GO NORTH TO 58TH AVE (RALSTON) FOR MORE SHOPPING ON SUNDAY.

Attachment: Proposed January 2025 Service Change Survey Results 11.4.24 (5028 : January 2025 Service Change)

I just sent a long reply about how the current 100 is a huge disservice to anyone who lives west of Wadsworth in
Wheat Ridge.
I was wrong about an avenue number. Ralston Road is 58th ave. 52nd is where Arvada Ridge station is.
So that there is no mistake:

Packet Pg. 359

You need to specify exactly what "increasing frequency" means.

YOU NEED TO RUN THE BUS ALL THE WAY TO WALMART AND KING SOOPERS AT RALSTON AND
INDEPENDENCE ON SUNDAY
I've lived at Kipling and 26th ave and over the past few years have seen reasonable transit service (albeit no bus
AT ALL on sunday, so at least i guess, uh, thanks for that tiny fairly useless bit of service between 2 rail stations,
and NOT ACTUAL USEFUL SHOPPING SLIGHTLY BEYOND ARVADA RIDGE) but have also seen the
frequency drop to once an hour *(its OFTEN QUICKER for me to WALK AN ENTIRE MILE to 38th or Colfax
instead of WAIT AN HOUR if I miss the bus by a minute or 2)
You KILLED OFF the 28/32 running west of Wadsworth - Why cant they come to at least Kipling? They SHOULD
both make a run to Youngfield and come back so that again, USEFUL SHOPPING at Youngfield and 32nd can be
accessed without a 2 mile walk. I literally have to HOPE that the 100, meets with the 38, so I can access King
Soopers and any other shops up there, or walk 2 miles. This is SO USELESS!
Finally - your bus schedules and G line schedules DO NOT MATCH PROPERLY.
You NEED to have the bus meet up with the train.
If the bus is going to sit for 5-10 minutes at Arvada Ridge doing nothing but perhaps the driver taking a
smoke/toilet break, then leave literally 2 minutes before a G-line is scheduled to arrive,(*This happens at EVERY
single station, with EVERY single bus I have relied upon since I started working in the DTC in 2007!) THIS IS
WORTHLESS. THIS IS NOT A TRANSFER. THIS IS A DISSERVICE TO YOUR RIDERSHIP!
I have so many complaints, along with MANY other riders literally getting to a station on a train, the bus PULLING
OUT OF THE STATION AFTER SEEING THE TRAIN ARRIVE, and having to wait an hour, or call an uber since it
was the last bus of the night and there are no other transit options.
So, please, for the love of god, MAKE THE 100 RUN UNTIL AT LEAST 8:30PM LIKE IT USED TO SO I CAN GO
TO THE STORE AFTER WORK AND NOT HAVE TO WALK MILES HOME
MAKE IT RUN ONCE EVERY HALF HOUR ACTUALLY ALIGNING PROPERLY WITH THE G LINE (at least W
line is back to every 15 mins, so regardless of how late the 100 is at least its not toooo long for another one)
MAKE IT RUN TO USEFUL SHOPPING AT 52nd(ralston) AND INDEPENDENCE ALL DAYS OF THE WEEK
OR BRING BACK THE 28/32 TO AT LEAST LOOP AT YOUNGFIELD NOW THAT THERE IS NO PNR AT I70
AND WARD ANYMORE.
There is NO useful transit in this part of wheat ridge.

Is it possible for the southbound buses to depart US 36 and Sheridan about 10 minutes later so connections to
the W and G line trains can be improved?

If the frequency of the 100 increases, this would be life changing. I have to take the 100 to the w line to get to
work. Right now one bus an hour is not enough as it leaves too much room for riders to be stranded or miss
transfers.
Having access to usable transit options requires that transit to come at a rate where it is useful to many groups of
people and more time options is an essential part of that. It is difficult to catch a transit option that does not come
frequently as the time may not work for many people's schedules. Adding increased service frequency is vital to
many transit users in making lines actually usable for them.
I like the increased frequency for the 100. I have heard from some other riders that they would prefer it to run
later.
1) This route connects suburbs instead of having to go downtown first
2) Increased frequency equals improved convenience which is what is required to improve ridership, NOT the
other way around
3) This route and improved convenience will further alleviate car traffic for those who still want or need to drive
4) The economic impact is also great with increased traffic through both Arvada's (Olde Town) and Westminster's
core downtown areas which will be further improved with the future extension of the W Line.
Maybe extend route to Littleton downtown station
This will be extremely good for the 100, I would add that the 72 would greatly benifit from higher frequencies as
wel
Please provide more frequent buses.

I am excited to see an increase in FlexRide service area; however as a FlexRide customer, additional changes I
would like to see are an improved app, and better advertising for the service at nearby transit hubs. Both of these
seem like they would be at least as effective at increasing ridership as expanding the boundaries.
While this service change doesn’t impact me specifically, increased access to public transit for Broomfield
residents (and everyone!) is always a good thing. I fully support this change. Thank you!
Please continue to expand Broomfield FlexRide service, it provides a valuable service to the community
especially after RTD cutbacks in Broomfield County in recent years!
As an equity concern, there should be RTD service that connects to Colorado Children's Hospital - North Campus
(869 CO-7, Broomfield, 80023) - right now the hospital is only accessible via private transportation and this is a
disservice to the community.

I would like to see the regular RTD route to 136th North Orchard Parkway or even to the Denver premium Outlet

The proposed change still fails to provide connections to fixed route service. Please move the southern boundary
further south to 120 for connection to the Route 120 bus. Or extend route 7 north to Denver Premium Outlets
where a connection to this service would be available. If neither of these are feasible, could it be combined with
the Wagon Road/144th Flex Ride?
Please add a connection to other RTD routes on the east side of this zone, such as at Wagon Road park-n-ride or

The resources used to create 30-minute weekend frequency on this route presumably come at the expense of

other hourly weekend routes - for example the 19 which had higher weekend ridership as of the Jan24 schedule

Please keep the current xx:25 and xx:55 departure times from Central Park Station that are 6 minutes after the
arrival of eastbound A Line trains.
The adjustments in theory work well, but it doesn’t do enough justice to provide transportation for those on the
Southeast Denver side. 65 is the only bus running from Quincy Avenue to Southmoor yet only twice an hour,
which is unjust for those needing to catch the train for work and school. This route needs to run more often on a
similar schedule that other Southmoor buses are running on.
this route has very high potential with improved frequency

Wouldn't it be much much better if 65 and 73 were departing 15min after each other?? (For instance: 65 departs
10.25, then 73 departs 10.40)
I live at Monaco and 6th ave, the northbound bus passes Leetsdale 3-4 minutes early 50%+ of the time, I miss the
connection from the eastbound 83/83L by 2-3 minutes so often that I am better off taking the 3 to Alameda &
Monaco and walking, which adds 20-30 minute wait for the connection from 83/83L to 3, then 15 minute walk,
My comment concerns the Central Park Station.
It would be very helpful if an enclosed/warm/out of the wind waiting area could be installed in the bus stop/train
area. Waiting for a connection during the winter months can be very uncomfortable.
Thanks
Could the timing be integrated with the A-Line more? It is frustrating to have bus pull up the same time the Airport
bound train does, requiring 15-30 minute additional time to commute to the airport.
By transit, my commute to work at the airport is calculated at around 1.5 hours. It's often closer to 2. Which is why
I drive the 30 minutes there.

Attachment: Proposed January 2025 Service Change Survey Results 11.4.24 (5028 : January 2025 Service Change)

I would like to propose a change in schedule either of line 65 or 73. As for the moment during the weekdays they
depart at the same time from the Central Park and go south almost paralel.
To get to south Denver in the neighborhoods around Monaco and Quebec Streets, if someone misses the
departure time of these lines, he has to wait next 30mins for next one!!!

Route 139 buses should start from Nine Mile Station 4 minutes after the arrival of southbound H Line trains and 4
minutes after the arrival of southbound R Line trains. Suggested times: xx:15 and xx:45 past the hour.
It used to come once every hour. I hope it’s going to be better now. Since after I come late on the h line, I miss
this quite often
Route 139, is a very helpful line that effectively helps people in neighborhoods that do not have a reliable mode of
transportation. By changing the frequency, those who need to go to Nine-mile, or other stops, can have the ability
to do so.

To better inform riders of where the US85 & Bridge St Park-n-Ride stop is located and the community it serves,
rename it to ‘Brighton Park-n-Ride’.
Eastbound route 520 buses should leave US 85 & Bridge Street PnR 5 minutes after the arrival of eastbound

I am excited to see an increase in FlexRide service area; however as a FlexRide customer, additional changes I
would like to see are an improved app, and better advertising for the service at nearby transit hubs. Both of these
seem like they would be at least as effective at increasing ridership as expanding the boundaries.
Please adjust the western boundary of the service area to reach the end of W 112th Ave in Broomfield/Jefferson
County. The current boundary excludes Quality Bicycle Products at 12805 W 112th Ave and other future
businesses within the Verve Innovation Park north of W 112th Ave and west of Simms St. I rely on this FlexRide to
get to work at Quality Bicycle Products, but due to the current boundary I have to walk nearly 1/2 a mile each way
in all conditions.
Can you please also shift the boundary west to the end of W 112th Ave so that Quality Bicycle Products at 12805
W 112th Ave and any future businesses in the Verve Innovation Park west of Simms St and north of W 112th Ave
are within the service area. I rely on FlexRide to get me to work safely in the winter and the current boundary
requires me to walk ½ a mile each way in all weather to get to Quality Bicycle Products.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Centennial State Liquid Investment Pool (CSLIP)
Participation

November 12, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
December 3, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve RTD’s participation in the Centennial State Liquid Investment Pool
(CSLIP).
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
Brenden Morgan, Senior Manager, Debt and Investments
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD’s 2025 Investment Policy (Policy) was approved by the Board on October 22, 2024. The Policy
objectives, in order of priority, are that RTD’s investment activities shall seek safety, liquidity and yield.
Safety of principal ensures that investments seek to preserve value and mitigate risk from losses as well
as credit and interest rate risk. Liquidity means that investments are easily accessible in cash form to
ensure cash flow requirements will be met. Yield seeks market rates for investment returns, taking into
account safety and liquidity. Each of these objectives contributes to RTD being a good steward of
taxpayer funds.
In order to meet these Policy objectives, RTD invests some funds in Colorado Local Government
Investment Pool trust funds (LGIPs). These investment pools are defined in Title 24 of the Colorado
Revised Statutes and are available to all Colorado local governments. LGIPs provide a benefit to
participating governments in the form of economies of scale, full-time portfolio management,
diversification, and liquidity. LGIPS also ensure that investment activity meets state statutory investment
requirements for Colorado local governments.
In addition to RTD’s fixed income investment portfolios, RTD currently invests in three Colorado LGIPS
known as the Colorado Surplus Asset Fund Trust (CSAFE), ColoTrust and the Colorado State Investment
Program (CSIP). Each of these LGIPS have been approved for investment of RTD funds by the RTD
Board. Investing in more than one investment pool provides diversification of RTD’s investments while
also taking advantage of differing investment approaches to ensure the most efficient management of
RTD’s funds.
DISCUSSION

Packet Pg. 379

18.G

A new Colorado LGIP, named Centennial State Liquid Investment Pool (CSLIP), was established in May
2024. The primary investment objective of CSLIP is providing a daily liquid cash management and
investment vehicle for Colorado local governments. CSLIP offers a conservative, professionally managed
portfolio consisting of certain allowable investments with the primary objective of preserving principal,
enabling liquidity, maintaining transparency, and maximizing yield. CSLIP seeks to maintain a stable
$1.00 per share Net Asset Value (NAV), meaning that participants’ investments will generally not be
susceptible to price volatility.
CSLIP is rated AAAM by Standard & Poor’s. CSLIP has contracted with State Street Global Advisors as
its registered investment advisor and Eide Bailey as its auditor.
Some of the local governments currently participating in CSLIP include:
• City of Centennial
• Boulder County
• Boulder Valley School District
• Alamosa County
• City of Cherry Hills Village
Staff is seeking Board approval for RTD to become a participant in CSLIP’s portfolio to expand RTD’s
available investment options. Approval would result in RTD’s ability to leverage CSLIP’s investment
approach while also further diversifying RTD’s investments thereby enhancing the safety and liquidity of
funds.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no direct financial impact from this recommended action.

INTRODUCTION
The Colorado Local Government Liquid Asset Trust (“CSLIP” or the “Trust”) was established in 2024
pursuant to Part 7, Article 75, Title 24, C.R.S., known as the Investment Funds - Local Government Pooling
Act (the “Pooling Act”) for the purpose of enabling Colorado local to pool their funds to maximize net
interest earnings. The Trust is a professionally managed local government investment pool trust fund
available only to governmental entities in Colorado.
CSLIP currently offers a single investment portfolio to participating Colorado governments. CSLIP is a
professionally managed portfolio consisting of U.S. Treasury securities, federal instrumentality securities,
agency securities, repurchase agreements, tri-party repurchase agreements, collateralized bank deposits,
commercial paper that, at the time of purchase, is rated in its highest rating category by at least two
nationally recognized organizations which regularly rate such obligations, corporate bonds, and government
money market funds rated “AAAm”. CSLIP aims to maintain a high level of current income while enabling
liquidity and preserving Participant’s capital.
The Trust was created pursuant to the CSLIP Indenture of Trust (the “Indenture”), dated as of May 7, 2024.
Governmental entities that participate in CSLIP are referred to as “Participants” in the Indenture and in this
Information Statement. CSLIP’s Indenture, this Information Statement, Investment Policy, and current
financial statements are publicly available on CSLIP’s webpage: www.cslip.org. Capitalized terms not
defined herein have the meaning ascribed to them in the Indenture.

PARTICIPANTS
CLSIP is available to any Colorado local government that adopts the Indenture and opens an account with
CSLIP. Each local government Participant appoints a designee (each a “Designee”), and all official
communications between the Trust and a Participant are through the designee.

INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES
CSLIP is designed to provide daily liquidity while generating current income and preserving capital for
Colorado governmental entities by investing only in securities that are legal pursuant to the Part 6, Article
75, Title 24, C.R.S. (the “Legal Investments Act”) and Articles 10.5 and 47 of Title 11, C.R.S. (“the Public
Deposit Protection Act”)
CSLIP’s written investment policies permit the Trust to maintain a portion of its assets in U.S. Treasury
securities or repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities. It may also invest its assets
in securities of a Federal Farm Credit Bank, a Federal Home Loan Bank, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corporation, the Federal National Mortgage Association, or the Government National Mortgage
Association, and other federal instrumentality or agency security permitted by the Legal Investments Act,
or repurchase agreements collateralized by those securities. CSLIP may also invest in credit obligations
rated in the highest rating category by one or more nationally recognized organizations that regularly rate
such obligations. The policy also provides that CSLIP may not invest more than 5% of its portfolio in the
credit obligations of any single issuer nor may CSLIP own more than 5% of any issuer’s total credit
program. In addition, the portfolio may invest in collateralized bank deposits and “AAAm” rated
government money market funds. The portfolio may invest in securities with a maximum maturity of 397

days for fixed-rate debt and non-sovereign floating-rate debt or 762 days for sovereign government floatingrate debt. The average weighted maturity may not exceed 60 days to reset or 90 days to final maturity.
CSLIP’s organizational documents have been accepted by the Securities Commissioner of the State of
Colorado in accordance with the Local Government Investment Pool Trust Fund Administration and
Enforcement Act (Part 9, Article 51, Title 11, C.R.S.).
CSLIP adheres to the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) and operates pursuant to GASB
Statement No. 79, Amortized Cost Basis methodology, for the determination of CSLIP’s transactional share
price(s). CLSIP’s methodology for reporting comports with the rules promulgated by the Colorado
Department of Regulatory Agencies Division of Securities. GASB Statement No. 79’s methodology
exempts Participants from a valuation disclosure required of some fair value funds by GASB Statements
No. 31 and No. 72.
CSLIP anticipates obtaining a rating of “AAAm” by S&P Global Ratings (“S&P”), which is highest rating
provided by S&P. According to S&P’s webpage, an “AAAm” rating is given to issuers that reflect an
“extremely strong capacity to maintain principal stability and limit exposure to principal losses due to credit
market and/or liquidity risks.” These ratings are neither a market rating nor a recommendation to buy, hold,
or sell the securities by the rating agencies.

INCOME ALLOCATIONS
All net income of CSLIP’s portfolio is determined as of the close of business each day (and at such other
times as the Board may determine) and is credited immediately thereafter pro rata to each Participant’s
account. Net income that has thus accrued to the Participants is converted as of the close of business as of
the end of each month into additional shares that are thereafter held in each Participant’s account.
Reinvested net income is converted into full and fractional shares at the rate of one share for each one dollar
credited. Net income for each portfolio each day consists of (1) all accrued interest income on assets of the
portfolio; plus or minus (2) any amortized purchase discount or premium; less (3) accrued expenses.

DETERMINATION OF NET ASSET VALUE
The Trust determines the NAV of the shares of CSLIP as of the close of business each day. The NAV per
share of the CSLIP portfolio is computed by dividing the total value of the securities and other assets of the
portfolio, less any liabilities, by the total outstanding shares of the CSLIP portfolio. Liabilities, which
include all expenses and fees of the CSLIP portfolio, are accrued daily.
For the purpose of calculating the NAV per share, the securities held by CSLIP are valued as follows: (1)
securities for which market quotations are readily available are valued at valuations provided by
independent pricing agents that utilize methodologies that rely on market data to determine market value;
(2) all other securities and assets are valued at fair market value determined in good faith by the Board in
consultation with their advisors.
The result of this calculation is a share value that is rounded to the nearest penny. Accordingly, the price at
which CSLIP shares are sold and redeemed will not reflect net realized or unrealized gains or losses on
securities that amount to less than $.005 per share. The Trust will endeavor to minimize the amount of such

Attachment: CSLIP-Information-Statement-Revised-8-22-2024 (5020 : Centennial State Liquid Investment Pool (CSLIP) Participation)

18.G.c

Packet Pg. 387

gains or losses. However, if net unrealized gains or losses should exceed $.005 per share, the NAV per share
will be maintained at $1.00 per share by retention of earnings or the reduction, on a pro rata basis, of each
Participant’s shares in the event of losses or by a pro rata distribution to each Participant in the event of
gains.
CLSIP’s Indenture of Trust provides that CSLIP shall seek to maintain an NAV of $1.00 per share. However,
the NAV may vary from $1.00 per share. The NAV per share of CSLIP may be affected by fluctuations in
interest rates, which in turn may cause increases or decreases in the total value of the securities held by the
Trust. The market value of such securities will generally vary inversely to changes in prevailing interest
rates, meaning that an increase in interest rates from the time a security is purchased may result in a lower
principal value for such security if sold prior to maturity, whereas a decrease in interest rates may result in
a higher principal value. If a security is held to maturity, no loss or gain is normally realized as a result of
fluctuations in interest rates.

DESCRIPTION OF SHARES
The beneficial interests of the Participants in the assets of CSLIP and the earnings thereon are, for
convenience of reference, divided into shares that are used as units to measure the allocation of beneficial
interest among Participants. All shares participate equally in distributions and have equal liquidation and
other rights. The shares have no preference, conversion, exchange, or preemptive rights. For all matters
requiring a vote of Participants pursuant to the terms of CSLIP’s Indenture of Trust, each Participant that
has deposited funds into CSLIP, through its Designee, is entitled to one vote with respect to each such
matter, without regard to the number of shares held by the Participant.

ELIGIBLE INVESTMENTS
The CSLIP portfolio invests in securities that are legal pursuant to the Legal Investments Act and the Public
Deposit Protection Act. For a more complete description of permitted investments please refer to the CSLIP
Investment Policy, available on www.CSLIP.org.

INVESTMENT RESTRICTIONS
The Trust may buy and sell and enter into agreements to buy and sell the permitted investments subject to
the restrictions described below. These restrictions are considered to be fundamental to the operation and
activities of the Trust and may not be changed without a majority vote of the Participants.
1. The Trust may not make any investment other than a permitted investment.
2. The Trust may not make any investment other than investments authorized by the Board’s
investment policy, Indenture, or the Legal Investments Act and the Public Deposit Protection Act,
as the same may be amended from time to time; provided, however, the Board and the Trust shall
not be responsible for insuring compliance with any investment restrictions provided for in a
Participant’s home rule charter, investment policy, or elsewhere.
3. The CSLIP portfolio may invest in permitted securities with maximum maturities as outlined by

4. The Trust may neither borrow money nor incur indebtedness whether or not the proceeds thereof
are intended to be used to purchase permitted investments except as a temporary measure to
facilitate withdrawal requests which might otherwise require unscheduled dispositions of CSLIP
portfolio investments and only as to the extent permitted by law.
5. The Trust may not buy securities from or sell securities to the Fund Administrator, the Board
Administrator, the Investment Advisor, the Custodian, or any member of the Board (Trustee), or
with any affiliate, officer, director, employee, or agent of any of them.
The Trust may not enter into any repurchase agreements for any securities that are not listed as “permitted
investments” in the previous section. In addition, all such agreements must be initially collateralized at
102% and additional securities must be provided if the market value of the collateral falls below 101.5%.

COMPUTATION OF YIELD
The Trust quotes a daily and seven-day average yield for the CSLIP portfolio in reports and information
published by the Trust. To obtain the daily yield, a daily yield factor is first calculated. The factor is the net
income for that day divided by the number of shares outstanding. The factor is then multiplied by 365 (366
in a leap year) to produce the daily yield. The seven-day average yield is obtained by averaging the daily
yield for seven identified, consecutive days. The Trust may also quote the CSLIP portfolio yield from timeto-time on other bases for the information of its Participants.
The yields quoted from time-to-time should not be considered a representation of the yield of the CSLIP
portfolio in the future since the yield is not fixed. Actual yields will depend on various factors, including
but not limited to the credit quality, type of security, potential changes in interest rates, and maturity terms
of the investments held by the Trust as well as potential changes in the expenses of the Trust.

INVESTMENT RISKS
The following is a discussion of certain risks and other factors to be considered in connection with a
prospective investment in the Trust. Prospective Participants should fully understand and evaluate these
risks and other factors, as well as the information set forth elsewhere in this Information Statement, in order
to make an informed investment decision. Each prospective Participant is urged to consult with its own
legal, financial and tax advisors to determine whether an investment in the Trust is appropriate for such
prospective investor. This section is not intended to be an exhaustive list of all risks associated with an
investment in fixed income securities, nor are the risks set forth in this section necessarily presented in
order of relevance, materiality or importance.
Risks Relating to the Credit Profile of CSLIP’s Portfolio. Investors in the Trust are subject to the risk that
an issuer of a fixed-income security held in the Trust will default on the security by failing to pay interest
or principal when due. If such a default occurs, Participants in CSLIP may incur losses. In addition, a decline
in the credit quality of an issuer or a provider of credit support or a maturity-shortening structure for a
security can cause the price of a such security to decrease. The Investment Advisor will seek to manage
this risk by purchasing high-quality securities as determined by one or more national ratings organizations
and/or the Investment Advisor’s internal credit research team, however, there is guarantee that an event of
default as described herein will not occur.

Packet Pg. 389

Risks Relating to Stable Net Asset Value. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of investments
therein at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so.
No Insurance or Guaranty. An investment in the Trust is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Neither CSLIP nor its affiliates have any obligation
to provide financial support to the Trust.
Interest Rate and Income Risks. Interest rate increases can cause the price of a fixed-income security to
decrease. Further, a low or negative interest rate environment can adversely affect the Trust’s yield.
Liquidity Risk. The Trust is subject to certain liquidity risks in which the size of a bond’s market, the
frequency of trades, the ease of valuation, and/or issue size may impact the Investment Advisor’s ability to
sell investments in a timely fashion or at or near fair value in order to fulfill a Participant’s redemption
request.
Market Risk. Investments in the Trust are subject to general markets risks, including the risk of rapid and/or
unpredictable fluctuations in the value of the securities held in the Trust, due to factors relating to the
macroeconomy, geopolitical events, the securities markets generally, or industry-specific disruptions.
Risks Related to the Issuer of Securities Held in the Trust. The value of the securities held in the Trust
may decline for reasons directly related to the issuer such as management performance, financial leverage,
and reduced demand for the issuer’s goods or services. It is also possible that a bond issuer (or counterparty)
will default by failing to repay principal and interest in a timely manner.
Suitability. Investment in the Trust may not be suitable for all investors. Investors should review this
Information Statement and CSLIP’s Investment Policy in order to determine whether such investment is a
suitable and eligible investment under for the relevant local government when considering your overall
investment objectives.
Past Performance No Guarantee of Future Results. Any financial and/or investment decision may incur
losses. Many factors affect performance including changes in market conditions and interest rates and in
response to other economic, political, or financial developments. Investment involves risk including the
possible loss of principal. No assurance can be given that the performance objectives of a given strategy
will be achieved. CSLIP anticipates that an “AAAm” rating by S&P Global Ratings will be obtained after
S&P evaluates a number of factors, including credit quality, market price exposure, and management.
Ratings are subject to change and do not remove market risk. CSLIP is not a bank.

FEES AND EXPENSES
CLSIP currently imposes the fees and expenses listed below, though such fees may be subject to change.
The fees are charged directly against investment earnings. Participants will not incur any direct fees. Fees
for the services of the Fund Administrator, Board Administrator and Investment Advisor are calculated as
a percentage of average daily net assets as follows: (1) $0-$1 billion: 0.1375%; (2) over $1 billion: 0.1275%.
These fees are accrued daily and payable monthly. An additional fee up to twelve and one quarter (12.25)
basis points is set aside to pay other operational expenses including, but not limited to, expenses of the
Board, insurance, legal, audit, rating, custody, and banking services.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
2025 Legislative and Government Relations Program

November 21, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
December 3, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt the 2025 Legislative and Government Relations Program.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Davies, Government Relations Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
As part of the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan, staff initiated a process to develop and implement an annual
Legislative and Government Relations Program. The RTD Board of Directors approved the agency’s first
Legislative and Government Relations Program in October 2021. The Legislative and Government
Relations Program is adopted by the Board of Directors annually and serves as a guiding document for
Government Relations staff, and external advocates, to pursue goals related to legislation and policy
matters. Additionally, the Legislative and Government Relations Program serves as an organizing
document that can be adjusted throughout a legislative session to provide an avenue for Board adopted
policy positions to be communicated and pursued by agency staff.
DISCUSSION
In line with the agency’s mission and vision established in the Strategic Plan, the development and
inclusion of the goals and actions contained in the Legislative and Government Relations Program are
designed to make lives better through connections. It is important that RTD serve as a trusted partner to
the region’s local, state, and federal elected officials. To achieve the adopted goals, RTD must be
proactive to educate and inform the District’s elected officials of the challenges and opportunities
available to advance shared objectives. Equally important is building trust through partnership that fits
within the framework of RTD’s financial forecast. The 2025 Legislative and Government Relations
Program, included as Attachment A to this Board report, outlines priority actions on a variety of issues
that staff believe are achievable through advocacy and collaboration.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Legislation can have a financial impact on RTD, but Board approval of this document has no any
immediate financial impact on the agency.

2025 Legislative and Government Relations Program
PURPOSE
To establish a set of Board-approved legislative and advocacy policies that benefit the Regional
Transportation District (RTD) and assist in guiding staff’s actions and efforts during the 2024
legislative session that support the priorities and success outcomes of the agency’s adopted 20212026 Strategic Plan.
STRATEGY
Developing and maintaining relationships with myriad stakeholders is central to RTD’s strategic
approach to government relations. Staff will work to communicate, educate, inform and partner
with the agency’s Congressional delegation, the Governor’s Office, the state General Assembly
delegation, and local elected officials to advocate for Board approved policies.
Additionally, staff will continue to work with its industry associations – such as the America Public
Transportation Association (APTA), the Colorado Association of Transit Agencies (CASTA),
regional transportation management organizations/associations (TMOs/TMAs), Chambers of
Commerce, and other stakeholder organizations – to partner and collaborate on shared goals to
advance and seek support for legislative positions approved by the Board. Specifically included
within this strategy is staff’s collaboration with the Board of Directors to utilize relationships to
advance policies. Lastly, tactics included in the Legislative Program will be guided and informed
by the priorities set forth in the agency’s Board-approved 2021-2026 Strategic Plan – Community
Value, Customer Excellence, Employee Ownership, Financial Success.
EXECUTION PLAN
Contained herein are specific priorities and actions that outline areas of focus for the 2024
Legislative and Government Relations Program. Beyond the actions listed in this program, specific
legislative matters are likely to arise that warrant consideration by the Board of Directors.
To allow staff flexibility for consideration of items to be changed, added, or deleted as a result of
legislation introduced during the legislative session, the recommended change must be presented
to the Board as part of the Board Executive Committee or another Committee deemed appropriate
by the General Manager/CEO and Board Chair. If time does not allow for an item to be agendized
for a Committee meeting for discussion by the Board, RTD will remain neutral on the legislation
in question.

BACKGROUND
The Board adopted the Internal Audit Committee Charter on October 25, 2022, and made initial
appointments to the Independent Audit Committee (Committee) on November 15, 2022. The Committee
is comprised of three RTD Board members and two external members with expertise in the audit
profession. The Committee’s Charter establishes that Board members shall serve on the Committee for
two-year staggered terms and external members will serve two- or three-year terms overlapping election
years. In order to be eligible to serve on the Committee, Directors must have served on the Board of
Directors for at least one year.
The current make-up of the committee is as follows:

*At the request of Chair Davidson, on October 8, 2024, the Board Office solicited interest from
Directors to serve on the Committee and fill the position opening as a result of Director Davidson’s term
on the Committee concluding on December 31, 2024. All interested Directors were asked to submit a
resume and letter of interest to the Board Office by Friday, October 25, 2024. The Board Office received
interest only from Director Buzek. The process outlined in the aforementioned email called for interested
Directors to submit documents to the Board Office, which would then forward those documents to the
Independent Audit Committee for review. The Independent Audit Committee reviewed materials from the
interested Director and recommended to the Executive Committee the appointment of Director Buzek to
the Independent Audit Committee.
**Director Dishell has resigned from the Board effective November 17, 2024. However, he has
expressed an interest to remain on the Committee and is eligible, per the Committee’s charter, to seek
the Board’s approval to continue to serve on the Committee for a period of up to one year.
***Mr. Olenberger’s current term is expiring on December 31, 2024. Because he has both indicated a
desire to remain on the Committee and served admirably, it is recommended that the Board reappoint
Mr. Olenberger for a subsequent term. This mirrors the process to reappoint Directors Catlin and Dishell
to the Committee in 2023 to terms expiring in 2025.
DISCUSSION
Director Buzek has served on the Board of Directors since January 1, 2019, and was instrumental in
helping to set-up the Committee in its current form. Originally elected to the Board in November of
2018, Director Buzek was re-elected in November of 2022. Outside of RTD, Director Buzek has
practiced law since 1987, primarily serving clients in Illinois (1987-1994) and Colorado (1994 to
present). Director Buzek previously served as a Council Member for the City and County of Broomfield
from 1999 to 2007. Additionally, Director Buzek has served on the Adams County Planning
Commission, the Colorado Gaming Commission, and the Broomfield Economic Development Corporation.
Both former Director Dishell and Mr. Olenberger have served on the Committee since its inception in
2023. Director Dishell has chaired the Committee since that time as well. Mr. Olenberger is a Certified
Public Accountant with nearly 25 years of internal audit experience. He has broad experience in
providing process consulting, risk management, internal audit, quality assessment reviews, and financial
statement attestation services to a variety of public and private entities.
This discussion aligns with the strategic priority of Community Value as effective audit oversight of RTD
helps to ensure the agency provides maximal value to the community.

COMPOSITION
The Audit Committee will consist of at least three and no more than five members, all of whom, in the judgment of
the Board of Directors, shall be independent in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations. To qualify as

all Audit Committee meetings. The Chief Audit Executive or designee will facilitate and coordinate meetings as well
as provide ancillary support to the committee, as time and resources permit.
Meeting agendas will be prepared in consultation with Audit Committee members, management, and its auditors, to
be provided in advance to members, along with appropriate briefing materials. Minutes will be prepared and all
documentation related to the Audit Committee and its dealings may be subject to the Colorado Open Records Act,
C.R.S. § 24-72-201 et seq., as amended. The Audit Committee will provide updates to the Board of Directors at least
quarterly.

Board Meeting Date:

Added to Committee Agenda as a Director initiated request pursuant to RTD Board Bylaws Art. V,
Section 3(b). Requires formal motion and second at Committee meeting.
MOTION
It is recommended by RTD Directors Catlin, Davidson, and Dishell that the Board of Directors appoint as
members of the Independent Audit Committee Jim Brendel (External Member) to a three-year term
expiring December 31, 2025, John Olenberger (External Member) to a two-year term expiring December

REPRESENTATIVE
Directors Catlin, Davidson, and Dishell
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
In December 2020, the Colorado Office of the State Auditor (OSA) completed a performance audit of
RTD and in April 2021, the American Public Transportation Association (APTA) completed a peer review
of RTD’s internal audit function, both of which included recommendations for improving RTD’s internal
audit function. RTD entered an engagement with RubinBrown, LLP (RubinBrown)for professional
assistance in implementing those recommendations according to standards promulgated by the Institute
of Internal Auditors (IIA) as well as to provide guidance regarding the staffing of RTD’s internal audit
function.
In January 2022, RubinBrown recommended that RTD outsource its internal audit function in order to
leverage the professional expertise of subject matter experts while also benefitting from the efficiencies
to be gained by contracting for hourly services as opposed to full-time employees.
In February 2022, RTD issued a request for proposals to outsource the internal audit function.
In June 2022, the RTD Board of Directors authorized RTD to enter a contract with RubinBrown to
provide internal audit services for three base years and two option years.
In July 2022, the RTD Board Chair appointed Directors Catlin, Davidson and Dishell to an Audit Ad Hoc
Committee to coordinate with RubinBrown on recommendations to the Board to implement the
outsourced internal audit function and form an RTD Audit Committee.

DIRECTOR REQUESTED AGENDA ITEM

Packet Pg. 407

In August 2022, the Audit Ad Hoc Committee, in coordination with RubinBrown, began the recruitment
for Audit Committee members. Recruitment for community members interested in volunteering to serve
on the committee was publicly advertised through the RTD website and LinkedIn. Applicants were asked
to respond to the request for qualifications with a letter of interest and resume.
Audit Committee members are expected to:
•
•
•

Possess the financial acumen to read and understand RTD’s financial statements and to
otherwise help the Board fulfill its fiduciary responsibilities
Attend four to five Audit Committee meetings per year
Review committee materials in advance of meetings and come prepared to ask questions and
participate in discussions

A total of six applications were received from external applicants and three applications were received
from current Board members.
Consistent with the Audit Committee Charter, adopted by the Board on October 25, 2022, the term of
office for an Audit Committee member is two years for a Board Member, except for two initial one-year
terms upon initial formation of the Audit Committee. Board Members will have a two-year term,
staggered with at least two Board members’ terms overlapping an election year. External members of
the Audit Committee will have two or three-year terms, staggered to overlap election years. Continuance
of Audit Committee members will be reviewed annually. To ensure continuity within the Audit
Committee, the appointment of future members should be staggered to avoid full turnover in the Audit
Committee.
DISCUSSION
In adopting this recommended action, the agency seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan priorities
of Community Value, Customer Excellence, Employee Ownership, and Financial Success. The purpose of
this action is to appoint well-qualified individuals who can advise the District on a range of transit issues
that affect RTD customers, the public, and the region.
The Audit Ad Hoc Committee in conjunction with RubinBrown and Chief Financial Officer Doug MacLeod
carefully reviewed the qualifications and recommend the below appointments to the Independent Audit
Committee.

BOARD CHAIR REQUESTED AGENDA ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Bylaw Amendments to Update Descriptions of the Executive
and Performance Committees

November 21, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
December 3, 2024

Added to Committee Agenda by the Chair pursuant to RTD Board Bylaws Article VI., Section 1(b).
Requires formal motion and second at Committee meeting.
MOTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt the proposed Bylaw Amendments, which will clarify the roles of the
Executive and Performance committees as well as adjust several related administrative matters.

REPRESENTATIVES
Jack Kroll, Executive Manager, Board Office
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Executive Committee approved its 2024 work plan during the committee meeting held on Thursday,
March 21, 2024. The work plan called for the Executive Committee to review its role as described in the
Bylaws in September 2024. However, that conversation was delayed for efficiency purposes to allow for
further time to develop proposed amendments to the description of the Performance Committee in
response to the Office of the State Auditor’s (OSA) Fiscal Governance Performance Audit.
The Fiscal Governance Performance Audit, released on Monday, August 5, 2024, contained a number of
recommendations for RTD. Recommendations 6 and 7 relate to the Performance Committee, and RTD’s
responses to those recommendations indicated the Board would consider a Bylaws amendment to clarify
the Board’s role in both receiving updates related to the agency’s strategic plan and approving certain
changes to the strategic plan.
Proposed amendments to the Executive and Performance Committee descriptions were presented to the
Executive Committee for review in October, and the Board Office solicited input from all Directors
subsequently via email. The proposed amendments are now being brought forward for the Board’s
consideration.
DISCUSSION
The Board is asked to review and discuss the final proposed descriptions of the Executive and
Performance committees as well as several related administrative changes in the attached redline and

Packet Pg. 410

18.J

clean versions of the Board’s Bylaws. To be adopted, proposed amendments to the Bylaws must receive
an affirmative vote of 10 or more Directors.
This action aligns with the Strategic Priorities of Community Value and Customer Excellence, as
clarifying the roles of the Board’s committees allows the Board to more efficiently accomplish its work
on behalf of the community and customers RTD serves.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact to the Board amending its Bylaws.

PREAMBLE
The Regional Transportation District (“RTD” or the “District”) was created by the Regional Transportation District
Act, § 32-9-101 et seq., C.R.S. (the “RTD Act”) (Senate Bill 309, Sessions Law of Colorado, 47th General Assembly,
First Regular Session, 1969). The District is a political subdivision of the State of Colorado, with those powers
specifically granted and those reasonably implied from the RTD Act and necessary or proper to carry out the
objects and purposes of the District.
The authority of the Board of Directors to adopt these Bylaws is expressly conferred by the RTD Act, at § 329-114 (1) (b), C.R.S. Some rules governing the internal affairs of the Board of Directors are contained in the RTD
Act, while others are contained in other laws and others, by delegation, are to be established by the Board. For
convenience of reference, those that are contained in the RTD Act or other laws, together with those that are
adopted under delegated authority, are combined in these Bylaws. Nothing contained in these Bylaws, nor any
omission from them, shall be construed as an alteration or deviation from any grant of power, duty, or responsibility
to, or any limitation or restriction imposed upon the Board under the RTD Act or other applicable laws as they
now exist or may be amended.
ARTICLE I – DEFINITIONS
The terms “district,” “board,” “director,” “publication,” “mass transportation system,” and other terms defined in
the RTD Act, and used in these Bylaws, shall have the same meaning as in the RTD Act unless the context clearly
indicates a different meaning. “State Audit” as used in these Bylaws means the performance audit conducted by
the Office of the State Auditor in 2009 and 2010 and reported to the state Legislative Audit Committee in March
2010.
ARTICLE II – BOARD OF DIRECTORS
All powers, privileges, and duties vested in or imposed upon the District shall be exercised and performed by and
through the Board, whether set forth specifically or implied in these Bylaws. The Board may delegate to officers
and employees of the District any or all executive, administrative, and ministerial powers.
ARTICLE III – OFFICE

as in its judgment are needed to conduct the business of the District. The office of the Board shall be located
within the RTD District.

Added to Committee Agenda by the Chair pursuant to RTD Board Bylaws Article VI., Section 1(b).
Requires formal motion and second at Committee meeting.
MOTION
For the Board of Directors to appoint three new members to three-year terms, appoint five new members
to two-year terms, and reappoint two members to three-year terms to the Citizens Advisory Committee.
REPRESENTATIVES
Jack Kroll, Executive Manager, Board Office
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
Originally known as the FasTracks Advisory Committee, the Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) was
established by the Board in 2004 when it referred the FasTracks measure to the ballot for voter
approval. The CAC has had different responsibilities since its creation and has undergone updates and
changes in the last twenty years, the most recent of which occurred on May 29, 2024 when the Board
approved the CAC’s Charter. The Charter sets forth the CAC’s role and membership parameters.
Broadly, the CAC exists to provide the Board and RTD feedback on general matters relating to RTD’s
system of public transit. The CAC can have up to 17 members who serve staggered three-year terms.
Members are selected based on a host of criteria including demonstrated interest in transit, membership
in civic organizations, and community service. Additionally, the CAC should resemble a broad crosssection of RTD’s district and include members from various geographic and demographic backgrounds.
The Board last made appointments to the CAC in August of 2021. Since that time, the Board in
collaboration with CAC leadership, revised the terms of CAC members to run from January to
December. Previously, the terms of members expired at the end of the month prior to their appointment
(i.e. a member was appointed in August to a term that would expire three years later in July). Typically,
with a membership of 17, the CAC would have five or six seats up for appointment or reappointment in
any given year. However, the Board has gone several years without making any appointments or
reappointments and the Charter was revised to change the timing of when terms begin and end within
the calendar year. As such, the Board is asked to consider three appointments and two reappointments
to three-year terms as well as five appointments to two-year terms. Making the committee appointments
in this way will help to reset the CAC membership ranks to a more regular cadence. All individuals

appointed to a two-year term this year, retain the opportunity to be reappointed for a subsequent threeyear term at the conclusion of their initial term in December 2026.
On August 23, 2024, per the CAC Charter, Chair Davidson sent an official call to CAC Co-Chairs Bryn
Grunwald and John Fussa as well as Board Office Executive Manager Jack Kroll to begin recruiting new
CAC members. Subsequently, the Board Office built and opened an application for CAC members on
October 1, 2024. The application was closed on October 25, 2024. The Board Office worked with the
Communications and Engagement Department, current RTD Directors, and the CAC to promote the
application. A total of 34 applications were received. Applications came from every Director District in
the RTD except for Director Districts M and O.
The nominating committee comprised of Director Julien Bouquet, Director Jaime Lewis, CAC Co-Chair
Byrn Grunwald, CAC member Andrea Suhaka, and Board Office Executive Manager Jack Kroll reviewed
the applications, met to discuss the application pool, and is making the recommendations for
appointment contained herein.
All current CAC members with initial terms expiring in 2024 or 2025 were solicited for their interest in
returning to the CAC for a subsequent three-year term. Danny Fisher and Matt Frommer expressed an
interest in returning to the CAC and are likewise recommended for reappointment given their
engagement and service to the CAC during their initial terms.

reappointments to the CAC.

DIRECTOR REQUESTED AGENDA ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Transit Passes for Former Board Directors

November 21, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
December 3, 2024

Added to Committee Agenda as a Director initiated request pursuant to RTD Board Bylaws Art. V,
Section 3(b). Requires formal motion and second at Committee meeting.
MOTION
For the Board of Directors to build upon, ratify, and reaffirm the existing agency practice to provide
annual transit passes to all former Board Directors and a designated immediate family member by
adopting the enclosed resolution establishing the right of all former Directors and a designated immediate
family to an annual pass in perpetuity.
REPRESENTATIVES
Director initiated action presented by Directors Tisdale, Buzek, Whitmore, Broom, Bouquet, Catlin,
Guissinger, Guzman, Harwick, Ruscha, Rosenthal, and Sloan.
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
For as long as anyone presently or previously associated with RTD can remember, RTD has always
accorded the right to all former Board Directors and a designated immediate family member, the privilege
of riding on all means of RTD transit, including bus and rail, on a fare-free basis through their lives after
their terms of public service have ended. Despite this tradition and practice being well-established and
invariable in its application, it has come to the attention of the Board that the Board has never formally
promulgated a written policy cementing and documenting this practice.
DISCUSSION
Board Directors selflessly provide service to the RTD, often for many years. Particularly in the case of
Directors, the compensation they receive for this service is nominal at best. One benefit that has been
accorded historically is the right to have a lifetime transit pass for use on the RTD system, for
themselves and for a designated immediate family member. This benefit is seen as some small token of
the appreciation of the agency for their service. The RTD Board, desirous of preserving and perpetuating
this beneficial practice, has determined that it is in the best interests of the agency—and the public that
the Directors have selflessly served—to confirm such practice and policy formally, subject to revocation
only upon the vote of ten (10) RTD Directors. This policy shall apply equally and in all respects similarly
for all former RTD Board Directors.

For those good and sufficient reasons, the Board now seeks the adoption of the attached resolution
relating to Transit Passes for Former Board Directors.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
This policy will not have any additional financial impact as it merely continues and documents an
existing practice
