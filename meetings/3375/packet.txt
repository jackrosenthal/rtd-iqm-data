BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Audit Committee Charter

October 11, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
October 25, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt the Audit Committee Charter.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
In December 2020, the Colorado Office of the State Auditor (OSA) completed a performance audit of
RTD and in April 2021, the American Public Transportation Association (APTA) completed a peer review
of RTD’s internal audit function both of which included recommendations for improving RTD’s internal
audit function. RTD entered an engagement with RubinBrown, LLP for professional assistance in
implementing those recommendations according to standards promulgated by the Institute of Internal
Auditors (IIA) as well as to provide guidance regarding the proper staffing of RTD’s internal audit
function.
In January 2022, RubinBrown recommended that RTD outsource its internal audit function in order to
leverage the professional expertise of subject matter experts while also benefitting from the efficiencies
to be gained by contracting for hourly services as opposed to full-time employees.
In February 2022, RTD issued a request for proposals to outsource the internal audit function.
In June 2022, the RTD Board of Directors authorized RTD to enter a contract with RubinBrown, LLP to
provide internal audit services for three base years and two option years.
In July 2022, the RTD Board Chair appointed Directors Catlin, Davidson and Dishell to an Audit Ad Hoc
Committee to coordinate with RubinBrown on recommendations to the Board to implement the
outsourced internal audit function and form an RTD Audit Committee.
DISCUSSION
At the September 13, 2022 Finance and Planning Committee meeting as well as the September 28,
2022 Board meeting, a Discussion item was presented to garner feedback regarding the draft Audit
Committee Charter.
Those changes have been incorporated into the attached document for consideration for final approval.

Audit Committee Charter

The Audit Committee is a committee of the Board of Directors of the Regional Transportation District (RTD)
PURPOSE
The Audit Committee shall represent and assist the Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities
of the organization’s governance, risk management, and internal control practices. The Audit Committee
provides the Board of Directors and management independent advice and guidance on the adequacy of the
organization’s initiatives for:
▪
▪
▪
▪
▪
▪

Values and ethics
Governance structure
Risk management

of Directors as a whole.

The Audit Committee has authority to conduct or authorize investigations into any matters within its scope of
responsibility. It is empowered to:
▪

▪
▪
▪
▪
▪

Appoint, compensate, and oversee all audit and non-audit services performed by any registered public

STATUS

1.D.1.a

Subject: Audit Committee Charter
Page 2

The Audit Committee will consist of at least three and no more than five members, all of whom, in the judgment
of the Board of Directors, shall be independent in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations. To qualify
as independent, an audit committee member may not be employed by, or provide any services to, the
organization beyond their duties as a committee member or Board Member. The members should collectively
possess sufficient knowledge of audit, finance, specific industry knowledge, IT, law, governance, risk, and
control. Because the responsibilities of the Audit Committee evolves in response to regulatory, economic, and
reporting developments, it is important to periodically re-evaluate members’ competencies and the overall
balance of skills on the committee in response to emerging needs. At least one member shall be designated as
the "financial expert," as defined by applicable legislation and regulation.
The Board of Directors shall have three members of the Audit Committee, of whom shall have served on the
Board of Directors for at least one year. Should a Director cease to maintain a position on the Board of Directors,
such a Director can, with the approval of the Board of Directors, continue to serve on the Audit Committee for
a period of up to one year.
The Board or its executive committee will appoint committee members and the committee chair. Provided the
Board does not designate a chair, the members of the Audit Committee, by a majority vote, may designate a
chair.
The term of office for an Audit Committee member is two years for the Board of Directors, except for two initial
one year terms upon initial formation of the Audit Committee. Board Members will have a two-year term,
staggered with at least two Board members’ terms overlapping an election year. External members of the Audit
Committee will have two or three-year terms, staggered to overlap election years. Continuance of Audit
Committee members will be reviewed annually. To ensure continuity within the Audit Committee, the
appointment of members should be staggered to avoid full turnover in the Audit Committee.
Each member of the Audit Committee shall serve for such term or terms as the Board may determine or until
his or her earlier resignation, removal or death. Any vacancy on the Committee shall be filled by the Board. No
member of the Audit Committee shall be removed as a member, except by the Board.
MEETINGS
The Audit Committee will meet at least four times a year, with authority to convene additional meetings, as
circumstances require. All committee members are expected to attend each meeting, in person or virtually, and
are obligated to prepare for and participate in meetings. The quorum for the Audit Committee will be a majority
of its members.
The Chief Audit Executive (as defined in the internal audit charter) and Chief Financial Officer are required to
attend all Audit Committee meetings. The Chief Audit Executive or designee will facilitate and coordinate
meetings as well as provide ancillary support to the committee, as time and resources permit.
Meeting agendas will be prepared in consultation with Audit Committee members, management, and its
auditors, to be provided in advance to members, along with appropriate briefing materials. Minutes will be
prepared and all documentation related to the Audit Committee and its dealings may be subject to the Colorado

requirements for the professional practice of internal auditing and for evaluating the effectiveness of the Internal
Audit Function’s performance.

independent and objective mental attitude.

for review and approval. The internal audit plan consists of a work schedule as well as budget and resource
requirements for the next fiscal/calendar year. The CAE communicates the impact of resource limitations and
significant interim changes to Executive Leadership and the Audit Committee. The internal audit plan is
developed based on a prioritization of the audit universe using a risk-based methodology, including input of
Executive Leadership and the Board. The CAE reviews and adjusts the plan, as necessary, in response to changes
in RTD’s business, risks, operations, programs, systems, and controls. Any significant deviation from the
approved internal audit plan must be communicated to Executive Leadership and the Board through periodic
activity reports.
REPORTING AND MONITORING:
The CAE prepares and distributes written report upon the conclusion of each internal audit engagement at least
quarterly. Internal audit results must also be communicated to the Audit Committee at least quarterly.
The internal audit report may include responses from Executive Leadership and corrective action taken or to be
taken regarding the specific findings and recommendations. Responses from Executive Leadership, whether
included within the original audit report or provided thereafter (i.e. within thirty days) by management of the
audited area, should include a timetable for anticipated completion of action to be taken and an explanation for
any corrective action that will not be implemented.
The Internal Audit Function is responsible for appropriate follow-up on engagement findings and
recommendations. All significant findings remain in an open issues file until cleared.
The CAE periodically reports to Executive Leadership and the Audit Committee on the Internal Audit Function’s
purpose, authority, and responsibility, as well as performance relative to its plan. Reporting must also include

benefits under FAMLI are funded by a 0.9% premium on employee wages, split between the employee
and the employer. Premium collections for participating entities begin January 2023, and benefits begin
January 2024.
For local government entities that opt to participate in FAMLI, the program supplements the provisions
of the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which provides eligible employees up to 12 weeks
of unpaid job-protected leave per year for specified reasons, by providing eligible employees access to
12 weeks of paid medical and family leave. FMLA also provides military leave entitlements for those on
active duty or on call to active duty.
FAMLI provides 12 weeks of paid leave per year for the same reasons as FMLA but goes beyond by:
• Covering a percentage of an employee’s salary during the leave
• Extending the definition of family member beyond immediate family to grandparents,
grandchildren, siblings and any other individual with whom the employee has a significant
personal bond
• Providing safe leaves for the employee if they or a family member are the victim of domestic
violence, stalking, sexual assault or abuse
• Providing an additional four weeks of leave for complications due to pregnancy or childbirth
Eligibility for FAMLI is based on earnings, whereas FMLA is based on length of employment. An
employee becomes eligible for FAMLI after earning at least $2,500 in wages within the previous four
quarters, whereas the person would need to be employed by the same employer for at least 12 months
and would need to have worked a minimum of 1,250 hours to be eligible for FMLA. Leave for any
qualifying reason under FAMLI that also qualifies under FMLA runs concurrently.

Packet Pg. 19

1.D.3

Paid benefits under FAMLI equate to 90 percent of the State Average Weekly Wage (SAWW) plus 50
percent of the employee’s wage above SAWW, up to a $1,100 weekly max. As of May 2022, the
SAWW annual salary equivalent is $63,024.
FAMLI is designed to run concurrently with FMLA. Employees will be able to use FAMLI and FMLA
leaves for circumstances covered by both laws; however, eligible employees may take FAMLI related
leave for circumstances not covered by FMLA followed by an additional 12 weeks of FMLA. Employers
cannot require that an employee first use their accrued paid time off (PTO) or sick/vacation leave to be
paid during FAMLI.
A local government entity, meaning any county, city and county, town, school district, special district,
authority, or other political subdivision of the state, has three options under the FAMLI provisions:
1. Participate fully
2. Decline participation fully
3. Decline employer participation and provide an alternative
A local government entity that elects to fully participate in FAMLI must remain in the program and agree
to pay premiums for a minimum of three years.
The governing body of a local government that elects to decline participation, whether fully or for the
employer only, must take testimony and provide notice to employees and the opportunity to submit
comments through a public process prior to final action. In addition, notice of the final action must be
provided to employees and the FAMLI Division of the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment
must be notified of the outcome by January 1, 2023.
As of the submission date of this recommended action, the Colorado municipalities that have opted-out
of FAMLI include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

City and County of Denver
City of Golden
City of Lafayette
City of Loveland
City of Wheat Ridge
City of Black Hawk

Town of Frisco

DISCUSSION

Packet Pg. 20

1.D.3

RTD currently provides employees access to paid leave to take care of themselves or their family during
life circumstances that pull them away from their jobs. However, in recognizing the leaves under the
FAMLI program build upon these benefits in certain instances, staff recommends the Board vote to optout of mandatory participation in FAMLI to enable employees to decide what is best for their own
situation. Doing so will excuse compulsory premiums on all employees regardless of their participation.
No employee will receive a reduction in benefits regardless of their decision to participate in FAMLI or
not.
In adopting this recommended action, the agency seeks to meet the strategic priorities of Employee
Ownership and Financial Success.
The table below provides an overview of current leave benefits offered:

In addition, the table below provides a description of the benefits offered through the FAMLI program:

On Monday, September 26, 2022, the General Manager and CEO, provided a memorandum to all
employees with information regarding the FAMLI program’s premiums and benefits. The Chief
Administrative Officer facilitated a virtual Lunch-n-Learn session on Wednesday, September 29, 2022, to
further educate and inform employees regarding the FAMLI program and to provide notification of this
recommended action. In addition, informational posters outlining all benefits available to employees,

Packet Pg. 21

1.D.3

including those that will be available from the FAMLI program, have been placed in all breakrooms in
RTD facilities. This advance notification exceeds FAMLI requirements and will allow ample time for
employees to prepare written comments or public testimony at the October 11, 2022 Finance and
Planning Committee meeting and the October 25, 2022 Board of Directors meeting when FAMLI
participation will be considered by the Board for final action.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The estimated financial impact of opting in to FAMLI is $2,022,683 for the initial program year, split
equally between the agency and employees.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Second Amendment to the RTD Salaried Defined
Contribution Plan

Committee Meeting Date:
October 11, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
October 25, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve an amendment to the salaried employee defined contribution
retirement plan to retain $200,000 in annual forfeitures for administrative expenses.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD provides a Defined Contribution (DC) retirement plan for all non-represented employees hired on
January 1, 2008, and thereafter. RTD currently contributes 9.0% of wages with no employee
contribution.
This DC Plan requires employees to be employed with RTD for five years before any vesting occurs. At
the employee’s five-year anniversary, the employee becomes 100% vested in these contributions. Any
employees that leave prior to their five-year anniversary forfeit all contributions.
DISCUSSION
The current DC Plan documents allow the DC Plan Trust (Trust) to retain $100,000 of annual forfeitures
within the plan to pay administrative expenses. These expenses include costs for attorneys,
administrators, bank fees, investment consulting, insurance, postage, and recordkeeping. Forfeitures in
excess of $100,000 are returned to RTD. This process is in place to allow the Trust administrator to
easily process invoices as opposed to seeking reimbursement from RTD for each expenditure.
The existing limit of retaining $100,000 of forfeitures within the DC Plan have been insufficient to pay
ongoing expenses. In 2021, expenses were $131,735 for which RTD provided additional funding to the
DC Trust. Through June 2022, expenses are $95,779.
The attached DC Plan amendment seeks Board approval to retain $200,000 of forfeitures in the DC Plan
annually to provide funding for ongoing expenses.
The DC Plan Trustees have approved this request to the RTD Board to amend the DC Plan and concur
that $200,000 is sufficient at this time. The Trustees will continue to monitor expenses and return any
significant excess funds to RTD if they grow beyond a reasonable amount.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no material impact from this recommended action, because RTD has been providing the funding
of DC Plan expenses, regardless of the amount of forfeitures retained in the Trust.

BACKGROUND
Each year staff presents the proposed Investment Policy for approval for the upcoming fiscal year. The
Investment Policy may be amended by the Board at any time.
The most recent modification to the Investment Policy was approved by the Board of Directors in
November 2021 for the 2022 fiscal year. Staff is requesting changes to page 9 regarding reporting
requirements. These changes reflect current reporting in which quarterly investment reports are provided
in Board Briefings and removes the annual reporting requirement due to redundancy. In addition, changes
are being requested regarding the maturity reporting in that average annual maturities of investments
would be reported rather than by specific investment since a large proportion of investments are placed
in investment pools. Average portfolio maturity is more meaningful to assess overall portfolio exposure
to interest rate risk.
Directors Lewis and Dishell had requested in July 2022 that staff review RTD’s Investment Policy in
relation to provisions for Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG). In reviewing those provisions and
considering other local government agency investment policies, it was determined that language
modification to RTD’s Investment Policy would not be necessary due to statutory requirements limiting
RTD’s ability to invest only in certain types of highly rated, low duration investment instruments.
Essentially, RTD primarily invests in federal government and agency debt such as Treasury Bills, rather
than private entity securities, which virtually eliminates exposure to investments that do not meet typical
ESG qualifications.
DISCUSSION
The purpose of the Investment Policy is to specify the policies and procedures that support a prudent
and systematic program for investment of RTD’s operating funds, debt proceeds and reserve funds.
The primary objectives of RTD’s Investment Policy in order of priority are: 1) safety of principal, 2)
sufficient liquidity to meet known cash flow requirements, and 3) yield to achieve a market rate of
return. Although RTD must legally follow the investment parameters dictated by § 24-75-601.1,
Colorado Revised Statutes, this Investment Policy is more conservative in order to achieve the Strategic
Priority of Financial Success.

2023 INVESTMENT POLICY

1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this document is to specify the policies and procedures that support a prudent
and systematic program for investment transactions involving operating and reserve funds of the
Regional Transportation District (RTD).
2. SCOPE
This investment policy (Policy) applies to investment of all operating and reserve funds of the
RTD (collectively, the Portfolio).
This Policy shall not restrict the ability of RTD to invest proceeds from the issuance of RTD
securities in financial obligations permitted through board-approved bond resolutions or indentures
of trust pursuant to which the securities were issued. The standards of care dictated for
investments of other RTD funds shall also pertain to the investment of such proceeds.
3. OBJECTIVES
The objectives, in priority order, of the RTD's investment activities shall be:
3.1 Safety
Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the investment program. Investments of RTD will
be made in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the Portfolio. To attain
this objective, RTD will endeavor to mitigate credit and interest rate risks.
Credit Risk: RTD will minimize credit risk, which is the risk of loss due to the failure of the
security issuer or backer, by:
•
•

Limiting investments to the types of securities listed in the Authorized Investments
section of this Policy.
Diversifying the Portfolio in accordance with Policy limits in order to minimize the
potential for losses from any one type of security or any one individual issuer.

Interest Rate Risk: RTD will minimize interest rate risk, which is the risk that the market value
of securities in the Portfolio will fall due to changes in market interest rates, by:
Maintaining Portfolio duration appropriate to the cash flow requirements of RTD, thereby
reducing the likelihood that securities would need to be sold on the open market prior
to maturity.

3.2 Liquidity
The Portfolio will remain sufficiently liquid to enable RTD to meet all cash flow requirements
which might be reasonably anticipated. This will be achieved through maturity diversification and
purchases of securities that have an established secondary market.
3.3 Yield
The Portfolio shall be designed with the objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout
budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account the investment risk constraints, liquidity
needs, and cash flow characteristics of the Portfolio.

4. STANDARDS OF CARE
4.1 Prudence
All RTD officers and employees involved in the investment of RTD funds, along with any external
investment advisors, shall adhere to the guidance provided by the “prudent investor” standard to
insure that:
“When investing, reinvesting, purchasing, acquiring, exchanging, selling, or managing
public funds, a trustee shall act with care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the
circumstances then prevailing, including, but not limited to, the general economic
conditions and the anticipated needs of the agency, that a prudent person acting in a like
capacity and familiar with those matters would use in the conduct of funds of a like
character and with like aims, to safeguard the principal and maintain the liquidity needs of
the agency. Within the limitations of this section and considering individual investments
as part of an overall strategy, investments may be acquired as authorized by law."
RTD shall recognize that no investment is totally riskless and that the investment activities of
RTD are a matter of public record. Accordingly, it recognizes that occasional measured losses are
inevitable in a diversified portfolio and shall be considered within the context of the overall
Portfolio’s return, provided that adequate diversification has been implemented, and that the sale
of a security is in the best long-term interest of RTD.

Authorized investment personnel acting in accordance with this Policy and exercising due
diligence shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security’s credit risk or market
price changes, provided that deviations from expectation are reported in a timely fashion and
appropriate action is taken to control adverse developments.

RTD is granted legislative authority to invest its funds pursuant to Colorado Revised Statutes,
Section 32-9-119. Management responsibility for the investment program is hereby delegated to
the General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) and her designees. The GM/CEO’s designee will
hereinafter be referred to as the Chief Financial Officer (CFO).
RTD may, in its discretion, contract with one or more investment advisers, registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, to manage a
portion of its Portfolio assets. Any such advisor shall comply with this Policy and such other
written instructions as provided by RTD.
While it is understood that the procedures and trading counterparties of a contracted investment
adviser may differ from those of RTD, contracted investment advisers must maintain internal
controls and compliance systems at least as extensive as those of the RTD in order to assure
adequate protection of RTD assets in keeping with the standards of prudence outlined below.
4.3 Investment Procedures
The CFO shall establish written procedures for the operation of the investment program,
consistent with this Policy, which shall include explicit delegation of authority to persons
responsible for investment transactions. No person may engage in an investment transaction
except as provided under the terms of this Policy and the internal procedures established by the
CFO. Persons who are authorized to transact investment business and wire funds on behalf of
RTD are listed in Appendix 1 to this policy.
4.4 Internal Controls
The CFO shall establish a system of internal controls, which shall be reviewed annually. The
controls shall be designed to prevent loss of funds due to fraud, employee error, misrepresentation
by third parties, or imprudent actions by employees of RTD.
4.5 Ethics and Conflicts of Interest
Investment activities shall be performed in accordance with RTD’s Code of Ethics and other
policies of RTD. Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from
personal business activity that could conflict with the proper execution of the investment

5. AUTHORIZED INVESTMENTS
Authorized investments for RTD funds are specifically listed below. RTD recognizes that
investment risk can result from issuer defaults, market price changes or various technical
impediments leading to diminished liquidity or loss of capital. Portfolio risk management and
diversification are employed as a way to minimize the risks inherent in investing.
Credit Criteria: Credit criteria listed in this section refer to the credit rating at the time the security
is purchased. Rating categories defined by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations
(NRSROs) include intermediate rating categories. For example, the second highest rating category
(AA) includes bonds rated AA+, AA and AA- for Standard & Poor's and Fitch, and Aa1, Aa2
and Aa3 for Moody's Investors Service. In the event that an issuer or security is downgraded
below the minimum rating level for any specific security that is held in the Portfolio, the CFO will
review the exposure of that security holding and will determine if it is advisable to sell such
holding.
Maturity Restrictions: Maturity restrictions shall be calculated from settlement date to maturity
date. Portfolio percentage restrictions by security type and issuer are applicable only on the date
of purchase of the investment.
Sector Diversification: The Portfolio will be limited to an aggregate exposure of 50% for the
following investment types: Municipal Bonds, Corporate Bonds, Commercial Paper, Time
Deposits/Time Certificates of Deposit and Banker's Acceptances.
1. U.S. Treasury Obligations. Obligations in the form of bills, notes, bonds or certificates of
indebtedness backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America. 100%
of the Portfolio may be invested in U.S. Treasury Obligations. The maximum maturity for
investments in U.S. Treasury Obligations shall be limited to five years.
2. Federal Agency and Instrumentality Securities: Obligations, participations or other
instruments of any Federal agency, instrumentality or United States government-sponsored
enterprise as described in CRS 24-75-601.1(1)(b) (an Agency or Agencies). Such securities
shall be rated in one of the two highest rating categories (as described above in the Credit
Criteria section) by at least two NRSROs. No more than 75% of the Portfolio may be
invested in Federal Agency and Instrumentality Securities, with no more than 25% being

and investment officials shall disclose to the GM/CEO any material financial interests in financial
institutions that conduct business with RTD, and they shall further disclose any large
personal/financial/investment positions that could be related to the performance of the Portfolio.
Employees and officers shall subordinate their personal investment transactions to those of RTD

more than 50% of the Portfolio.
6. INVESTMENT PARAMETERS
6.1 Sale of Securities
RTD does not make investments for the purpose of trading or speculation, but, rather, with the
prevalent intent to hold securities to maturity. The prohibition of speculative investment precludes
pursuit of profit through unusual risk or conjectural fluctuations in market prices. However,
fluctuations in market rates or changes in credit quality may produce situations where securities
may be sold at a nominal loss in order to mitigate further erosion of principal or to reinvest
proceeds of sale in securities that will out-perform the original investment.
6.2 Competitive Bidding
RTD shall obtain competitive bid or offer information on all purchases or sales of investment
instruments on the secondary market. A competitive bid or offer can be executed through a
bidding process involving at least three separate brokers/financial institutions. If RTD is offered
a security for which there is no readily available competitive offering on the same specific issue,

Packet Pg. 48

Attachment: RTD 2023 Investment Policy.doc (4705 : 2023 Investment Policy)

No more than 50% of the Portfolio may be invested in repurchase agreements and no more
than 10% may be invested with a single counterparty. The maximum maturity for a
repurchase agreement shall be limited to 90 days.

1.D.6.a

Subject: 2023 Investment Policy
Page 8

the investment officer may document quotations for comparable or alternative securities. When
purchasing original/new issue securities, no competitive offerings will be required as all dealers in
the selling group offer those securities at the same original issue price.

The maturity of the securities in the Portfolio shall be managed with respect to the cash flow
needs of RTD and the Portfolio shall be managed to maintain a duration of three years or less.
6.4 Authorized Financial Dealers and Institutions
RTD or an investment advisor hired by RTD will maintain a list of financial institutions authorized
to provide investment services and it shall be the policy of RTD to purchase securities only from
those authorized institutions and firms. Trading counterparties shall be limited to (i) primary
dealers reporting to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, or (ii) broker/dealers that qualify under
Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15c3-1 (uniform net capital rule).
6.5 Authorized Investment Advisors
RTD may engage the services of one or more professional investment advisory firms to assist in
the management of the Portfolio. Such investment advisors may be granted discretion to
purchase and sell investment securities in accordance with this Policy and may utilize their own
approved list of broker/dealers. Such firms must be authorized to conduct business in the State
of Colorado and shall be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

7. SAFEKEEPING AND CUSTODY
7.1 Safekeeping and custody
With the exception of collateral under repurchase agreements (discussed below), all investment
securities purchased shall be held in a safekeeping account or trust custody account at a
designated third party custodian. For safekeeping accounts, the institution shall issue a
safekeeping receipt for each security, listing the specific instrument, par value, rate, CUSIP and
any other pertinent information. In addition, the safekeeping or trust custody institutions shall
provide a statement on at least a monthly basis listing all securities held in account, including
book value and market value of holdings at month-end.
For collateral (purchased securities) under repurchase agreements, RTD may utilize tri-party
repurchase agreements with an acceptable third-party custodian provided that RTD is satisfied
that it has perfected interest in the securities used as collateral, and that RTD has a properly
executed tri-party agreement.

6.3 Portfolio Duration

1.D.6.a

Subject: 2023 Investment Policy
Page 9

7.2 Delivery vs. Payment
All investment transactions will be executed on a delivery versus payment basis.

Investment reports shall be prepared on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis. Transaction
summaries shall be maintained and available in the office of the CFO or other authorized
investment personnel. Quarterly investment reports shall be submitted to the Board of Directors
and shall outline RTD’s total investment return and compare the Portfolio’s performance to a
publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics.
Staff will include an annual listing of investments held and investment returns within the Annual
Comprehensive Financial Report.
All securities holdings reports for RTD shall disclose the average maturity of the investment
portfolio.
9. PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
RTD's Portfolio is managed with the objective of obtaining a market rate of return, commensurate
with identified risk constraints and cash flow characteristics. Because the composition of the
Portfolio fluctuates, depending on market and credit conditions, various indices may be used to
monitor investment performance.
The current board-approved index for the liquidity tier of the Portfolio (cash and cash equivalents)
is the ICE BofAML 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index. For the enhanced cash portion of the Portfolio
(securities maturing between 90 days and 5 years and with a target duration of 1 year), the
designated performance benchmark is the ICE BofAML 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.
RTD recognizes that bond proceeds must be invested in accordance with Section 1.148 of the
U.S. Internal Revenue Code, related to arbitrage rebate, which limits the investment returns which
may be achieved or retained by RTD on such proceeds investments. For purposes of this Policy
“bond proceeds” shall mean proceeds from the issuance of bonds, certificates of participation or
other financial securities issued by RTD.
10. INVESTMENT POLICY REVIEW AND APPROVAL
The CFO shall conduct a review of the Policy on an annual basis and present the Policy, denoting
any changes, to the Board of Directors for approval.

Maintaining Portfolio duration appropriate to the cash flow requirements of RTD, thereby

The Portfolio shall be designed with the objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout
budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account the investment risk constraints, liquidity
needs, and cash flow characteristics of the Portfolio.

4. STANDARDS OF CARE
4.1 Prudence
All RTD officers and employees involved in the investment of RTD funds, along with any external
investment advisors, shall adhere to the guidance provided by the “prudent investor” standard to
insure that:
“When investing, reinvesting, purchasing, acquiring, exchanging, selling, or managing
public funds, a trustee shall act with care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the
circumstances then prevailing, including, but not limited to, the general economic
conditions and the anticipated needs of the agency, that a prudent person acting in a like
capacity and familiar with those matters would use in the conduct of funds of a like
character and with like aims, to safeguard the principal and maintain the liquidity needs of
the agency. Within the limitations of this section and considering individual investments
as part of an overall strategy, investments may be acquired as authorized by law."

4.2 Delegation of Authority
RTD is granted legislative authority to invest its funds pursuant to Colorado Revised Statutes,
Section 32-9-119. Management responsibility for the investment program is hereby delegated to
the General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) and her designees. The GM/CEO’s designee will
hereinafter be referred to as the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”).
RTD may, in its discretion, contract with one or more investment advisers, registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, to manage a
portion of its Portfolio assets. Any such advisor shall comply with this Policy and such other
written instructions as provided by RTD.
While it is understood that the procedures and trading counterparties of a contracted investment
adviser may differ from those of RTD, contracted investment advisers must maintain internal
controls and compliance systems at least as extensive as those of the RTD in order to assure
adequate protection of RTD assets in keeping with the standards of prudence outlined below.
4.3 Investment Procedures
The CFO shall establish written procedures for the operation of the investment program,
consistent with this Policy, which shall include explicit delegation of authority to persons
responsible for investment transactions. No person may engage in an investment transaction
except as provided under the terms of this Policy and the internal procedures established by the
CFO. Persons who are authorized to transact investment business and wire funds on behalf of
RTD are listed in Appendix 1 to this policy.
4.4 Internal Controls
The CFO shall establish a system of internal controls, which shall be reviewed annually. The
controls shall be designed to prevent loss of funds due to fraud, employee error, misrepresentation
by third parties, or imprudent actions by employees of RTD.
4.5 Ethics and Conflicts of Interest
Investment activities shall be performed in accordance with RTD’s Code of Ethics and other
policies of RTD. Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from
personal business activity that could conflict with the proper execution of the investment

Authorized investment personnel acting in accordance with this Policy and exercising due
diligence shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security’s credit risk or market
price changes, provided that deviations from expectation are reported in a timely fashion and
appropriate action is taken to control adverse developments.

5. AUTHORIZED INVESTMENTS
Authorized investments for RTD funds are specifically listed below. RTD recognizes that
investment risk can result from issuer defaults, market price changes or various technical
impediments leading to diminished liquidity or loss of capital. Portfolio risk management and
diversification are employed as a way to minimize the risks inherent in investing.
Credit Criteria: Credit criteria listed in this section refer to the credit rating at the time the security
is purchased. Rating categories defined by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations
(“NRSROs”) include intermediate rating categories. For example, the second highest rating
category (“AA”) includes bonds rated AA+, AA and AA- for Standard & Poor's and Fitch, and
Aa1, Aa2 and Aa3 for Moody's Investors Service. In the event that an issuer or security is
downgraded below the minimum rating level for any specific security that is held in the Portfolio,
the CFO will review the exposure of that security holding and will determine if it is advisable to
sell such holding.
Maturity Restrictions: Maturity restrictions shall be calculated from settlement date to maturity
date. Portfolio percentage restrictions by security type and issuer are applicable only on the date
of purchase of the investment.
Sector Diversification: The Portfolio will be limited to an aggregate exposure of 50% for the
following investment types: Municipal Bonds, Corporate Bonds, Commercial Paper, Time
Deposits/Time Certificates of Deposit and Banker's Acceptances.
1. U.S. Treasury Obligations. Obligations in the form of bills, notes, bonds or certificates of
indebtedness backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America. 100%
of the Portfolio may be invested in U.S. Treasury Obligations. The maximum maturity for
investments in U.S. Treasury Obligations shall be limited to five years.
2. Federal Agency and Instrumentality Securities: Obligations, participations or other
instruments of any Federal agency, instrumentality or United States government-sponsored
enterprise as described in CRS 24-75-601.1(1)(b) (an “Agency” or “Agencies”). Such
securities shall be rated in one of the two highest rating categories (as described above in
the Credit Criteria section) by at least two NRSROs. No more than 75% of the Portfolio
may be invested in Federal Agency and Instrumentality Securities, with no more than 25%

and investment officials shall disclose to the GM/CEO any material financial interests in financial
institutions that conduct business with RTD, and they shall further disclose any large
personal/financial/investment positions that could be related to the performance of the Portfolio.
Employees and officers shall subordinate their personal investment transactions to those of RTD
particularly with regard to the timing of purchases or sales.

more than 50% of the Portfolio.
6. INVESTMENT PARAMETERS
6.1 Sale of Securities
RTD does not make investments for the purpose of trading or speculation, but, rather, with the
prevalent intent to hold securities to maturity. The prohibition of speculative investment precludes
pursuit of profit through unusual risk or conjectural fluctuations in market prices. However,
fluctuations in market rates or changes in credit quality may produce situations where securities
may be sold at a nominal loss in order to mitigate further erosion of principal or to reinvest
proceeds of sale in securities that will out-perform the original investment.
6.2 Competitive Bidding
RTD shall obtain competitive bid or offer information on all purchases or sales of investment
instruments on the secondary market. A competitive bid or offer can be executed through a
bidding process involving at least three separate brokers/financial institutions. If RTD is offered
a security for which there is no readily available competitive offering on the same specific issue,

Packet Pg. 60

Attachment: RTD 2023 Investment Policy Red Line (4705 : 2023 Investment Policy)

No more than 50% of the Portfolio may be invested in repurchase agreements and no more
than 10% may be invested with a single counterparty. The maximum maturity for a
repurchase agreement shall be limited to 90 days.

1.D.6.b

Subject: 2023 Investment Policy
Page 8

the investment officer may document quotations for comparable or alternative securities. When
purchasing original/new issue securities, no competitive offerings will be required as all dealers in
the selling group offer those securities at the same original issue price.

The maturity of the securities in the Portfolio shall be managed with respect to the cash flow
needs of RTD and the Portfolio shall be managed to maintain a duration of three years or less.
6.4 Authorized Financial Dealers and Institutions
RTD or an investment advisor hired by RTD will maintain a list of financial institutions authorized
to provide investment services and it shall be the policy of RTD to purchase securities only from
those authorized institutions and firms. Trading counterparties shall be limited to (i) primary
dealers reporting to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, or (ii) broker/dealers that qualify under
Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15c3-1 (uniform net capital rule).
6.5 Authorized Investment Advisors
RTD may engage the services of one or more professional investment advisory firms to assist in
the management of the Portfolio. Such investment advisors may be granted discretion to
purchase and sell investment securities in accordance with this Policy and may utilize their own
approved list of broker/dealers. Such firms must be authorized to conduct business in the State
of Colorado and shall be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

7. SAFEKEEPING AND CUSTODY
7.1 Safekeeping and custody
With the exception of collateral under repurchase agreements (discussed below), all investment
securities purchased shall be held in a safekeeping account or trust custody account at a
designated third party custodian. For safekeeping accounts, the institution shall issue a
safekeeping receipt for each security, listing the specific instrument, par value, rate, CUSIP and
any other pertinent information. In addition, the safekeeping or trust custody institutions shall
provide a statement on at least a monthly basis listing all securities held in account, including
book value and market value of holdings at month-end.
For collateral (purchased securities) under repurchase agreements, RTD may utilize tri-party
repurchase agreements with an acceptable third-party custodian provided that RTD is satisfied
that it has perfected interest in the securities used as collateral, and that RTD has a properly
executed tri-party agreement.

All investment transactions will be executed on a delivery versus payment basis.

Investment reports shall be prepared on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis. Transaction
summaries shall be maintained and available in the office of the CFO or other authorized
investment personnel. Quarterly investment reports shall be submitted to the Board of Directors

respective terms of each contract and agreement
All securities holdings reports for RTD shall disclose the averagemaximum maturity of the

callable security held.
9. PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
RTD's Portfolio is managed with the objective of obtaining a market rate of return, commensurate
with identified risk constraints and cash flow characteristics. Because the composition of the
Portfolio fluctuates, depending on market and credit conditions, various indices may be used to
monitor investment performance.
The current board-approved index for the liquidity tier of the Portfolio (cash and cash equivalents)
is the ICE BofAML 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index. For the enhanced cash portion of the Portfolio
(securities maturing between 90 days and 5 years and with a target duration of 1 year), the
designated performance benchmark is the ICE BofAML 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.
RTD recognizes that bond proceeds must be invested in accordance with Section 1.148 of the
U.S. Internal Revenue Code, related to arbitrage rebate, which limits the investment returns which
may be achieved or retained by RTD on such proceeds investments. For purposes of this Policy

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Call for Projects Partnership Program Update

Committee Meeting Date:
October 11, 2022

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Brian T. Welch, AICP, Acting Assistant General Manager, Planning
Bill Sirois, Senior Manager, Transit Oriented Communities
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 minutes
BACKGROUND
Dating back to 1994, RTD has demonstrated a commitment to bolstering and building partnerships, which
are recognized as key to meeting transit needs and connecting customers to the places they want and need
to go. Over the past year, staff has developed a clear and streamlined process by which local governments,
anchor institutions, transportation management organizations, non-profits and others are able to submit
partnership requests.
The proposed Call for Projects Partnership Program (Partnership Program) is predicated on several precedents
and related activities. Notably, the Partnership Program incorporates and reflects the following related
efforts:
•

Change, Challenge, and Connections: Strategic Plan 2021-2026: The Partnership Program is based
on the four Strategic Priorities and Success Outcomes, as applicable; the Operations Tactics and
Operations Performance Scorecard sections are helpful reference points for service requests.

•

Reimagine RTD: This effort includes recommendations on RTD’s role as a “Mobility integrator that …
partners with a broad group of stakeholders to support community-based services;” and the
Partnership Program reflects input from stakeholders received during Reimagine RTD outreach.

•

Mobility Choice Blueprint: Among the 34 tactical actions – covering topics such as Regional
Collaboration and Shared Mobility – RTD is identified as the initiator for 13 actions.

•

Transit Service Policies and Standards – Approved July 19, 2016: This document references the
Transit Service Cost-Sharing Policy adopted by the Board in 1994.

•

Agency Responses to the RTD Accountability Committee Final Report: RTD agreed with
Recommendation 42, which states that the agency should “Leverage existing and new partnerships
to improve service efficiency and grow ridership.” This response was tied to the Accountability
Finance Subcommittee’s recommendation that “RTD should have additional flexibility and clear

Packet Pg. 67

1.E.1

authority to contract with nonprofits and local governments for service delivery to ensure costeffective and efficient transit services.”
•

Subregional Service Councils: Advancing local partnerships with RTD to achieve community
transit goals has been a key focus area for multiple regional planning efforts including the
formation of Subregional Service Councils (SSCs). SSCs, whose formation was approved by
Board in June 2022, are proposed to be a forum for dialogue with local stakeholders about local
service partnership opportunities.

DISCUSSION
The formalized Partnership Program, which aligns with the Strategic Priorities of Community Value,
Customer Excellence, Employee Ownership, and Financial Success, will ensure that the agency can
address the strong desire for community-focused transit.
The presentation articulates this and includes the following:
•
•
•
•
•

Summary of current partnerships
Policies and goals
Options for funding allocation
Role of SSCs
Performance metrics and evaluation criteria

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Though the creation of new partnerships will result in agency financial impacts, there is no direct
financial impact associated with the adoption of the Partnership Program.

In 2019, Smart Commute was awarded a CMAQ grant for implementation of a new micro transit
service in the northern area of the RTD district, which became the Wagon Road FlexRide. As a
direct recipient of federal funds, RTD and Smart Commute entered into an agreement that
assigned these funds to RTD for operation of the service and established Smart Commute as a
subrecipient of the funds.

In 2016, the City and County of Broomfield was awarded a CMAQ grant for RTD to provide an
expanded Broomfield FlexRide service. In 2019, the City and County of Broomfield was awarded a
new grant to continue the service and explore future expansion. RTD and the City and County
entered into an agreement in July of 2021 to assign the new funds to RTD to allow for the
additional service through 2024.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
2023 Proposed Budget

Committee Meeting Date:
October 11, 2022

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
Todd Nikkel, Senior Manager, Budget
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
Pursuant to CRS 29-1-101, RTD will have the 2023 Proposed Budget available for public review by
October 15, 2022, as well as provide a transparent appropriation process allowing for Board and public
input and comment. Staff will then present the 2023 Proposed Budget for approval consideration by the
Board in November 2022 which will include a description of any changes since the October 2022
presentation.
The 2023 Proposed Budget and associated attachments are included in this Board Discussion item and
will also be posted to the RTD website with hard copies available in the Board Office for public review.
Furthermore, notices of these postings will occur in the Denver Post and the Boulder Daily Camera as
required by 29-1-106 (3) (a), Colorado Revised Statutes, to “be published one time in a newspaper
having general circulation in the local government.”
The 2023-2028 Mid-term Financial Plan (MTFP), which was approved by the Board on September 28,
2022, informs the development and consideration of approval of the 2023 Budget.
DISCUSSION
The attached 2023 Proposed Budget document includes narratives describing the financial assumptions
and alignment with RTD’s Strategic Plan. In addition, tables, charts and commentary are included for
evaluation of the considerations included therein.
Staff has developed the 2023 Proposed Budget to conform with RTD’s Fiscal Policy directives while best
meeting the transit needs of its customers and communities at large.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The 2023 Proposed Budget aligns expenditures with anticipated funding sources resulting in a balanced
budget while solidifying RTD’s financial position. RTD’s internal controls and budget appropriation and
amendment process provide those charged with leadership and governance responsibilities the
opportunity to adjust and realign appropriations throughout the fiscal year as necessary.

BUDGET MESSAGE FROM THE GENERAL MANAGER AND CEO

I am pleased to introduce RTD’s Fiscal Year 2023 budget.

• Continuation of the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan implementation framework,
aligning objective, measurable inputs with established strategic priorities and a
laser-like focus on employees’ efforts on metrics that matter to RTD’s overall
success outcomes

DEBRA A. JOHNSON

• Completion of the Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis to evaluate potential changes to the
fare structure and pass programs and develop recommendations to be considered for adoption by the
Board
• Implementation of the System Optimization Plan (SOP) with the January 2023 service change. Essentially,
the SOP sets the stage for the agency’s optimization of service delivery through the short-term component
of the Reimagine RTD effort, the agency’s Comprehensive Operations Analysis. The SOP is geared toward:
- Aligning service levels with workforce availability
- Increasing the agency’s focus on providing a high-quality, regional backbone network
- Sustaining the overall integrity of the transit network, and
- Maintaining assets in a state of good repair
RTD’s revenues, the funding that allows the agency to strive to deliver high-quality transit services, are derived
primarily from three main sources: sales and use taxes collected on goods and services purchased within RTD’s
service area; federal grants, which supplement not only RTD’s revenues but those of many transit agencies
across the country; and farebox revenues, the fares customers pay to utilize the agency’s services.
RTD, like most transit agencies across the country, was drastically impacted in the early days of the COVID-19
pandemic, as boardings plummeted and sales and use revenues declined as individuals, businesses, and
government entities went into lockdown. Federal rescue and relief funding provided a lifeline during difficult
financial times, and the agency has put those funds to good use by focusing on bolstering people power;
aligning wages, salaries, and benefits with those of comparable positions in the market and sustaining transit
operations at a time when individuals in our communities relied upon RTD for access to critical services.

Attachment: Attachment B - 2023 Proposed Budget (4712 : 2023 Proposed Budget)

The FY 2023 Budget represents a financial plan for what’s next for the agency in the
coming year. Among the highlights:

As the agency and the region continue to recover and stabilize from the pandemic’s impacts, we are
collectively finding new norms. Ridership is significantly lower now than in previous years. In fact, industry
analysts estimate that public transit agencies across the country will experience a permanent 15-20% decline
in ridership. Remote work shifts in the composition of the workforce, and competition from third parties such
as Uber and Lyft are just a few of the factors driving this change.

1.E.2.b

BUDGET MESSAGE FROM THE GENERAL MANAGER AND CEO

Public transit is among many industry sectors facing significant challenges, not least of which are critical
worker shortages, what I call people power problems, due to the Great Resignation that has taken place over
the past two years. I firmly believe that from that Great Resignation will follow a Great Reset, wherein
governments, industries, and individuals across the nation and the globe will have the opportunity forge a
new, sustainable path forward in a post-pandemic landscape; those with the foresight and determination to
seize this opportunity will reap great rewards. It is in this vein that transit industries have the chance to rewrite
old narratives about the purpose of public transit; no longer will transit agencies be measured solely by the
number of customers they can transport but rather by the value they deliver to the communities they serve.
This exciting and important discussion of “value over volume” continues to unfold across the agency at
agencies large and small.
Although we must recognize and account for many challenges, they are not what defines this agency.
I recognize, appreciate, and honor the collaborative efforts exhibited by all of the agency’s employees
and agency leaders, as well as the Board of Directors and our union and contractor partners during
these challenging times. I thank each of you for being one of the people who move people in the
Denver metro region.
Moreover, I extend my sincere thanks and appreciation for the contributions in the timely preparation of the
FY 2023 Budget to Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer; Todd Nickel, Senior Manager, Budget; Heidi
Wagner, Senior Manager, Finance; the Budget Analysts, and the Leadership Team.
As we look toward the upcoming year and reflect on the various changes and challenges we have
collectively endured, I am proud to reaffirm our commitment to the agency’s mission: “We make lives
better through connections.”
Sincerely,

Debra A. Johnson
General Manager and CEO

The Regional Transportation District’s (RTD) 2023 Proposed Budget (Budget) represents the expected
revenues, expenditures and financial position anticipated for the fiscal year January 1 through December
31, 2023. The RTD Board of Directors appropriates funding by fiscal year which allows RTD to continue its
mission to make lives better through connections. The expenditures set forth herein align the Budget with
RTD’s Strategic Plan Priorities within the projected financial constraints.
This Budget demonstrates RTD’s financial capacity to address the agency’s strategic priorities based on
current information. The development of the Budget is a cross-departmental collaborative effort; hence
the proposed budget for the Board’s consideration is a collective staff recommendation.
For FY2023, the operating expense budget is $783.2M and new capital is $26.8M for a total budget of
$810M. Carry forward of capital and expenses will be included in the final proposed budget.

Perspective
The 2023 Proposed Budget focuses on the Strategic Priorities of the Board-approved 2021-2026 Strategic
Plan. As a result, funding appropriations are aligned in a manner to direct efforts towards achieving the
desired success outcomes as measured by specific metrics.
As society emerges from the most significant impacts from COVID-19, additional clarity has and is being
realized regarding the future state of public transit services in general, as well as RTD’s specific
experiences. In light of this, a System Optimization Plan (SOP) approved by the Board is incorporated
within this budget. Additionally, RTD has positioned itself to meet the financial needs to remediate backlogs
in project completion and ensure that assets are maintained in a state of good repair.
While RTD’s current financial position is strong and funding capacity is available to fund initiatives and
programs within the Strategic Priorities, it is expected that the agency will continue to be challenged with
accessing adequate non-financial resources as a result of the difficult labor market environment, supply
chain issues and high inflation.
Economic conditions indicate that there is a potential for recession which historically has impacted RTD’s
largest source of revenue, sales and use taxes. Despite these economic headwinds, these tax collections
are still expected to grow modestly in 2023 as a result of high employment and projected gross domestic
product (GDP) growth within the District. Furthermore, RTD’s reserves remain in a strong position to
moderate financial impacts resulting from unexpected volatility.

Attachment: Attachment B - 2023 Proposed Budget (4712 : 2023 Proposed Budget)

Introduction

Although challenging circumstances exist in the economy, beneficial opportunities exist. The higher interest
rate environment negates the opportunities for additional interest savings from debt refinancings,
however, RTD will benefit from higher investment returns. In addition, impacts from the high inflation rate
environment will be tempered somewhat by RTD’s debt instruments all being issued at fixed rates in
addition to many annual contractual increases already being fixed.

Financial Discussion and Analysis

Revenues
Revenue sources are generally either recurring or finite. RTD’s Fiscal Policy establishes that one-time
revenues be used for one-time expenditures while recurring revenues provide a sustainable source to fund
ongoing needs. Because one-time revenues have a finite term, commitments for recurring expenditures
require an alternative source once the one-time revenues are exhausted.
RTD’s sources of recurring revenue, in descending order of size, are sales and use taxes, fares, federal
operating grants and miscellaneous revenue from advertising, investment income and rent. Historically,
RTD has also been the recipient of one-time revenues from federal capital grants, federal COVID-19 relief
funding, local contributions and land sales. RTD does not budget or forecast one-time revenues unless
certainty exists.
Revenue assumptions for the Budget include the following:
•

Fare revenue has been adjusted downward from 2022 expectations due to lower ridership. The
2022 Budget anticipated a gradual, modest return of ridership due to increased in-person
participation in universities and anticipated return-to-work requirements during the emergence
from the COVID Pandemic. While ridership has recovered from its nadir of 30% of pre-COVID levels
to approximately 60% currently, it has fallen short of the 2022 expectations of a gradual return to
85% of pre-COVID levels. As a result, the 2023 Budget reflects a 1.4% increase in ridership in
2023 that will drive fare revenue. In a September 2022 report, Standard and Poor’s predicts that
public transportation ridership will only return to 75% of pre-pandemic levels by 2025.

•

Sales and use tax projections were provided by the University of Colorado Leeds School of Business
(CU Leeds) in August 2022 and presented to the RTD Board in September 2022. Based on Moody’s
economic forecasts, the CU Leeds forecast model predicts that tax collections will increase 2.2% in
2023 vs. 2022 primarily driven by continued high employment, population growth and real GDP
growth in the Denver metro area. In addition, high inflation is pushing prices higher resulting in
higher taxes which is somewhat tempered by an expected modest decrease in spending. The RTD
forecast aligns with the statewide expectations from the Colorado Legislative Council (CLC) and
Office of State Budgeting and Planning (OSPB).

•

Operating grants of $141.7 million, primarily from the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), are a
recurring revenue stream to RTD. The grant apportionments are based upon financial and statistical
data that RTD submits to the National Transit Database (NTD). The FTA has agreed to apportion
amounts based on prior year NTD submissions excluding COVID-19 impacts and the Infrastructure
Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA)/Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) increases the annual

Attachment: Attachment B - 2023 Proposed Budget (4712 : 2023 Proposed Budget)

The financial aspects of a budget consist of three primary categories: revenues, expenditures and reserves.
Revenues and expenditures provide the cash inflows and outflows while reserves provide the financial
balance to smooth cash flow volatility and supply the financial relief necessary for unforeseen
circumstances that inevitably arise.

•

COVID-19 relief grants are anticipated to be fully drawn by the end of 2022. This additional grant
funding combined with strong sales and use taxes has contributed to an unprecedented balance
of over $1 billion in cash and investments as well as substantial reserves which, along with higher
interest rates, will generate additional investment income in 2023. These significant cash and
investment balances are earmarked for state of good repair needs and maintaining fund balances
in accordance with the RTD Fiscal Policy.

•

Other revenue includes recurring revenue of $16 million which consists primarily of a federal Build
America Bonds (BAB) interest rate subsidy and advertising revenues.

Expenditures
Expenditures consist of both recurring expenses, such as operating expenses, as well as occasional outlays
such as projects, debt service and capital expenditures.
RTD’s largest expenditures are providing transit-related operations. These costs include compensation,
materials and supplies, contracted services, insurance, utilities and other such expenses.
RTD also has a significant debt burden primarily from capital expansion projects as well as obligations
issued to finance the purchase of rolling stock. RTD has completed two refinancings in the past year to
realize interest savings and reduce the debt burden. As interest rates have risen recently, RTD does not
anticipate performing additional refinancings during 2023.
Furthermore, RTD has ongoing asset management needs that average approximately $120 million
annually. Asset management needs can fluctuate significantly by year when, for example, a single year
includes a large purchase such as fleet replacements. The 2023 Proposed Budget contemplates these
periodic needs through building Capital Replacement Fund reserves until needed. RTD has the ability to
fund these purchases with cash, rather than more expensive lease-purchases that have been utilized in
the past, and has budgeted and forecasted accordingly.

$1,100,000

Expenditure assumptions for the Budget include:
•

Salaries and wages assume full staffing to provide service levels in accordance with the System
Optimization Plan (SOP). While it is anticipated that continued high employment and the
competitive job market will prolong RTD’s ability to attract and maintain full staffing levels, funding
has been made available in these appropriations. In addition, the Collective Bargaining Agreement

•

Benefits include the following:
o A $1 million increase for represented employee health and welfare benefit increases
o A $3 million increase for non-represented health benefits due to an 8% Kaiser premium
increase as well as realignment of the CIGNA plan to provide a more attractive second
option based on benefits survey feedback from employees. The CIGNA option had shifted
significant premium costs from RTD to employees during the prior three years resulting in
employee dissatisfaction. While this increase is relatively material, if follows no net increase
in non-represented health and welfare costs in 2022 while also contributing to employee
satisfaction
o Dental and vision plans for employees remain largely unchanged for 2023, however, the
non-represented vision plan will shift to UNUM with no material change in cost while also
providing more options and flexibility for employees. This change resulted from feedback
received from employees through a benefits survey
o Represented employee retirement plans include an increase in RTD contributions to the
defined benefit pension plan from 13% of wages in 2022 to 15% with employee
contributions remaining at 5% per the CBA. This plan will be closed to new entrants in
2023. In addition, provisions have been included to fund the new defined contribution plan
at 9% with up to a 5% match for new employees beginning January 1, 2023. The defined
benefit pension plan is 82% funded, up from 53% funded in 2022, due to the 2022 onetime cash infusion of $160 million, and 2023 contributions are not anticipated to change
materially from 2022 while also maintaining adequate funding levels
o The non-represented employee defined benefit pension plan is funded with an $8.5 million
contribution based on the actuarial recommended contribution for 2023. This plan is 82%
funded, up from 78% funded in 2022, and currently has 143 active participants. This plan
has been closed to new employees since January 1, 2008 and funding requirements will tail
off over the next several years
o The non-represented employee defined contribution plan assumes RTD funding of 9% of
wages which is the same amount contributed in 2022. Board policy is to contribute 7-9%
of wages each year. Only non-represented employees hired January 1, 2008 and thereafter
participate in this retirement plan
o RTD will continue to offer the 457(b) retirement plan to all employees. This is a voluntary
plan for which only employee, and no RTD, contributions may be made up to Internal
Revenue Service annual limits. RTD will continue to fund the administrative costs

•

Materials and supplies consist of consumable items such as fuel, fluids and parts. Diesel fuel
purchases have been contracted at $3.20 per gallon, up from $2.30 per gallon in 2022. Contracting
fuel purchases provides budget certainty, particularly in the volatile fuel pricing environment. Diesel
and gasoline expenses typically account for 2% of operating expenses and the increases will add
approximately $630,000 to these costs in 2023. This increase in cost is offset by a decrease in
budgeted parts costs resulting from lower trends, supply chain constraints and increased focus on
utilization of parts inventory

(CBA) includes wage increases have been included with provisions for incentive pay for represented
employees until such time that adequate staffing levels are achieved. The compensation increases
in 2023 shown below are primarily driven by annual increases and additional RTD police officers,
which is partially offset by the decrease in contracted security services included in Outside Services

•

Services consist of contracted specialty IT and legal needs as well as security. Additionally, these
expenses contain inflationary increases which are offset by reductions resulting in a $27.9 million
decrease in 2023. The majority of the decrease is due to lower anticipated project activity as well
as a reduction in contracted security needs which will be replaced with RTD police officers. Project
activity is expected to be lower in alignment with current experience as well as people power and
supply chain challenges

•

Insurance costs have decreased over past years due to effective claims management. The 2023
budgeted costs include additional funding for commuter rail liability insurance coverage. While this
appears to be a net increase from 2021, insurance costs are relatively flat over an extended period
since 2022 commuter rail insurance was funded with a 15-month appropriation from 2021

•

Other expenses primarily contain expenditures for utilities and purchased transportation and, to a
lesser degree, various minor business expenses

•

Utilities include projected amounts for traction power commensurate with planned rail
service levels and in alignment with 2022 usage
Purchased transportation includes contractual increases and are aligned with expected
revenue service hours. The contractual increases in 2023 reflect fixed route bus and ADA
contract amendments negotiated in response to the desire of contractors to offer
competitive compensation packages as a result of the increases in the RTD CBA
Travel and training and budgets have been maintained from 2022 to 2023 to contribute to
employee development and industry participation after elimination in 2020 and 2021.
Expenses for each Board Director have been budgeted at $10,000 per individual for travel
and $1,680 for telephone
Funding for an on-call contract is included to address specialty consulting engagements, if
necessary
A budget of $250,000 is available for employee engagement to be used for outreach and
recognition programs. All other discretionary spending will continue to be limited

Debt service represents a significant portion of RTD’s annual expenditures. Debt service consists
of principal and interest payments on bonds, certificates of participation (COPs) and lease-purchase
agreements. Debt service payments for 2023 will total $225.8 million, down from $235.2 million in
2022 as a result of refinancings for interest savings. The Base System bond payments will expire
in 2024, at which point, the Base System will be subject to the Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TABOR)
restrictions.
