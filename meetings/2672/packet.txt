Subject:

Recommendation for Contract Award to HNTB
for FasTracks Systems Engineering Consultant
Services

General

Board Meeting Date: August 15, 2017

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize award of a five-year contract with an option for a one-year extension with HNTB
Corporation in the not-to-exceed amount of $22,368,708 for Systems Engineering consulting work.
BACKGROUND
In May of 2017, RTD advertised a Request for Proposals for professional services for a Systems
Engineering Consultant for FasTracks and Base system capital programs and state of good repair
projects for RTD. This contract will award work and authorize budget based on a work order system.
On 6/27/17 RTD received one proposal from the HNTB Corporation.
RTD put together a team with representation from Purchasing, Civil Rights, Quality Assurance, Systems
Engineering and Program Management to evaluate the proposal submitted by HNTB according to the
following evaluation criteria:
Proposals were evaluated according to the following criteria, listed in descending order of
importance:

The evaluation team rated and scored the HNTB proposal and found them to be fully compliant with all
of the evaluation criteria. Based on the proven performance by HNTB in the proposal on RTD and similar
transit systems nationwide, the evaluation team recommended that RTD move forward with award of
the contract to HNTB for Systems Engineering Consulting services.
DISCUSSION
RTD has used a single Systems Engineering Consultant for FasTracks and Base systems for consistency
and standardization of design. This approach has saved RTD cost and has facilitated the operation and
maintenance of the system. The incumbent Systems Engineering Consultant six-year contract has been
extended once and will have been in place for 12 years by December of 2017. For this reason, RTD
reexamined our needs and advertised for these services in order to secure a Systems Engineering
consultant to complete the FasTracks capital construction program and continue to support RTD’s Base
systems operations and maintenance.

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

The selected Systems Engineering Consultant will support RTD’s Systems Engineering staff on managing
the Southeast Rail Line Extension, the North Metro Rail Line, and projects on the RTD’s Base System.
The proposed Scope of Work to be performed under this Contract Award Authorization is as follows:


RTD Base System
˗ Prepare PE stamped construction drawings and specifications
˗ Provide project management and administration
˗ Provide coordination and project control, cost estimating, cost control assistance
˗ Prepare construction drawings and specifications for State of Good repair projects that are in
the SBP such as power switch upgrades, traction power studies, traction power PLC
upgrades, OCS wire replacements, signal improvement projects and stray current
measurement.
˗ Assist RTD in coordination with civil designers and other government agencies as it relates to
System Engineering.
˗ Incorporate design changes as requested by the RTD
˗ Provide CADD and Quality Assurance services as required by RTD



North Metro Rail Line
˗ Review systems submittals and construction design documents submitted by the Contractor
˗ Assist RTD in coordination with civil designers and other government agencies as it relates to
System Engineering
˗ Assist RTD in reviewing the North Metro Rail Line schedule
˗ Assist in cost estimating and negotiations for any systems-related changes including
operations and maintenance
˗ Perform field inspections
˗ Perform quality assurance audits as required by RTD’s Quality Assurance Program



Southeast Rail Extension Project
˗ Review systems submittals and construction design documents submitted by the Contractor
˗ Assist RTD in coordination with civil designers and other government agencies as it relates to
System Engineering
˗ Assist RTD in reviewing the Southeast Rail Extension schedule
˗ Assist in cost estimating and negotiations for any systems-related changes including
operations and maintenance
˗ Perform field inspections
˗ Perform quality assurance audits as required by RTD’s Quality Assurance Program

The contract award will be for a five-year period of performance with an option for a one-year extension.
The DBE goal for this contract was set at 5%. HNTB has committed to meet the 5% DBE goal.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for project scope to be completed in 2017 is included in the 2017 Adopted Budget for the
FasTracks capital program in the specific projects where HNTB support would be utilized. Funding for
future year’s scope for the FasTracks projects are identified in the 2016 Annual Program Evaluation and
the SBP. Projects requiring additional support identified in the 2016 SBP include: power switching on
emergency crossovers, SE corridor state of good repair, traction power substation PLC upgrade, Welton
St intersections warning signs replacement, stray current measurement and reporting and DUS signage.

ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks
Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize award of a five-year contract with an option for
a one-year extension with HNTB Corporation in the not-to-exceed amount of $22,368,708 for
Systems Engineering consulting work.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Reconsider the System Engineering approach to project
management and design. This is not recommended as RTD does not currently have the specialized
staff to meet the System Engineering needs of the FasTracks Program and Base System. Selection of
alternative two could delay implementation of the FasTracks Program and state of good repair on the
Base system.

INTRODUCTION
This document reports FasTracks
progress through 2015.

The Regional Transportation District (RTD) was created in
1969 by the Colorado General Assembly to develop, operate,
and maintain a mass transportation system for the beneﬁt of
2.88 million people in RTD's service area which includes all or
part of eight counties in the Metro Denver region. RTD is
governed by a 15 member elected Board of Directors. In
2015, RTD provided over 103 million transit rides.

FasTracks
FasTracks is RTD’s 2004 voter-approved rapid transit
expansion transforming transportation throughout the Metro
Denver region. Upon completion, FasTracks will add 122 miles
of new light rail and commuter rail, 18 miles of Bus Rapid
Transit (BRT) and 57 new transit stations to the RTD system.

Quality of Life
The Quality of Life (QoL) Study is RTD's data-driven
evaluation of progress toward meeting the FasTracks
Program goals.
Free MetroRide

Goal 1

Balance Transit Needs with Regional Growth

Goal 2

Increase Transit Mode Share

Goal 3

Improve Transportation Choices and Options

QoL 2015 Report
This document reports FasTracks progress from 2010 to
2015. It highlights progress made toward completing
projects, the impacts of those projects, and overall progress
toward the goals.

T R A V E L by T R A I N

In 2013, RTD opened the W Line in the West Corridor,
adding 12.1 miles of rapid transit facilities to the existing
34.8-mile rapid transit system. Investment resulted in:
7,600 new transit riders each weekday in the West Corridor
(12,800 weekday transit trips on the W Line).
30,000 vehicle miles traveled (VMT) were removed from
roadways each weekday (9 million VMT removed annually).

In 2014, RTD and their partners completed the construction
and renovations at Denver Union Station, creating one of the
most vibrant spaces in downtown Denver:
Transportation is at the heart of Denver. Again. Union Station
creates a space for locals, tourists, and business travelers to
explore RTD’s network.

85 fewer gas tanks were ﬁlled every weekday (400,000 fewer
gallons of fuel were consumed annually).

Development has been booming near Union Station. Between
2010 and 2015, 2,770 multi-family units, 130 hotel rooms,
900,500 square feet of ofﬁce, and 77,600 square feet of retail
were constructed.

Based on regional crashes/VMT, 23 vehicular crashes could be
prevented every year.

Property value per square foot in the neighborhood surrounding
Union Station increased 56% from $185 in 2010 to $290 in 2015.

At this rate, a life could be saved every 12 years and a severe
injury could be prevented every two years.

Between 2010-2015, 11 B-Cycle stations were added within a
half-mile of Union Station.

In 2014, RTD opened the Free MetroRide, providing a
frequent and reliable connection between Denver Union
Station and Civic Center Station for downtown commuters.
2014 average weekday boardings: 1,500
2015 average weekday boardings: 2,330
