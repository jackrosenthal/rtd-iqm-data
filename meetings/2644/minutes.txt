B. Recommended Actions

• Approve Contract Amendment for the Supply of 60 - 40' Transit Buses
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee,
to exercise the contract option and amend contract 13-FH-053 with Gillig
LLC. for the purchase of 60 additional 40’ transit buses and associated
spare components in an amount not to exceed $26,350,000.
Motion:

Director Tisdale made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the December 19th
Board Meeting.
Director Broom seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Bruce Abel, Acting Chief Operating Officer and Assistant
General Manager of Bus Operations, was joined by Steve
Gieske, General Superintendent of Maintenance. Mr. Abel
stated that buses identified in the recommended action were
part of a routine replacement of rolling stock. He said that the
agency was in the last year of an existing purchasing contract
in the Strategic Budget Plan, which the Board adopted in
October 2017, and that the vehicles would replace older 30foot and 40-foot buses as the agency transitioned to more 40foot vehicles in the bus fleet.
Director Broom asked about the delivery schedule for the
vehicles.

Mr. Gieske said that the manufacturer, Gillig, would produce
five buses per week from its plant in California.
Director Lubow noted that the buses were equipped with clean
diesel engines. She asked when the agency would envision
transitioning to electric vehicles.
Mr. Abel said that RTD has been active in the Volkswagen
(VW) settlement and that final rulemaking on the settlement
was in its final stages. He said the VW settlement money
would provide the difference between the cost of diesel and
electric buses, with the potential for additional monetary
incentive. He said the Board should expect staff to present
proposals for electric buses purchases in the future.
Director Folska said she supported the motion.

• 5311 Funding Agreement
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that
the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to
execute all documents necessary to enter into funding agreements with Via
Mobility Services and the Seniors’ Resource Center to provide RTD financial
support for the provision of FTA Section 5311 (non-urbanized) services for
Boulder County, Adams County and Jefferson County. These Agreements
are for calendar year 2018 and for amounts not to exceed $379,677.00 for
Boulder County, $373,346.00 for Adams County and $115,679.00 for
Jefferson County.
Motion:

Director Tisdale made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the December 19th,
2017 Board Meeting.
Director Williams seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Mr. Abel introduced Brian Matthews, Manager of Special
Services, and said that this recommended action followed

current practice. He stated that years ago the Federal Transit
Administration (FTA) offered a grant program to provide
funding for transit in non-urbanized areas. He noted that over
time certain rural areas that received FTA funding were
subsumed into the RTD urbanized area, and RTD agreed in
essence to receive and pass along to those areas the funding
they would have received from the FTA. He said the
recommended action authorized the General Manager to
execute contracts to disburse the funding. He said the
formerly non-urbanized areas included the City of Longmont
and portions of Douglas and Jefferson Counties.
Director Lubow asked whether the agency was putting in
some of its own money.
Mr. Abel said that the agency received money as a result of
those non-urbanized areas not receiving money and that the
areas were receiving the same amount of money from RTD
they would have received from the federal government.
Director Mihalik added that in Douglas County the funding
supported areas that were outside of the district.
Mr. Abel stated the county received the funding to support the
rural and non-urbanized service the county provided.
Director Folska said she supported the motion.
Chair Hoy asked whether RTD would receive the same amount
or less money if Longmont did not receive its share.
Mr. Abel said that RTD essentially received the same amount.
Chair Hoy asked how RTD would know how much the local
jurisdictions should have received from the FTA.
Mrs. Abel said that RTD received the same amount the
grantees would have received as of the last year before
entering into the funding agreement with RTD, plus an amount
adjusted to account for the change in the area consumer price
index.

• City of Boulder Hop Funding Agreement
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that
the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to
execute all documents necessary to enter into a Cost Sharing Agreement
with the City of Boulder to provide RTD financial support for the operation of
the HOP circulator bus service in the commercial areas of the City of
Boulder, the University of Colorado at Boulder and adjacent business and
residential areas. This agreement is for calendar year 2018 and is for an
amount not to exceed $1,430,742.00.
Motion:

Director Tisdale made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the December 19th,
2017 Board Meeting.
Director Lubow seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Mr. Abel explained that RTD provided money for the Boulder
Hop line. He said that Boulder and the University of Colorado
Boulder were the contractors for the line. He said that the
funding supported the level of service that RTD would have
provided if the other funding partners were not participating.
Director Lubow asked if the buses were RTD-branded.
Mr. Abel said the buses are branded as “the Hop”. He said the
service was acknowledged as a partnership between RTD and
Boulder. He noted that RTD participates in service level
decisions and that the service conforms to RTD’s fare
structure. He stated that Via Mobility was responsible for
hiring bus operators.
Director Lubow asked whether the agency considered this an
RTD route.

Mr. Matthews said the route was in the trip planner. He stated
that the Hop service follows RTD procedures, though RTD was
not responsible for its oversight.
Director Broom stated that circulator bus service had begun by
way of grant funding on the Anschutz medical campus. He
asked whether that route would be eligible for funding from
RTD in the same manner as the Hop.
Mr. Abel said that the Anschutz campus administrators asked
RTD to reroute the R Line corridor away from campus, as the
line was initially slated to run down Montview Boulevard. In
order to accommodate their request, RTD asked the Anschutz
administrators to provide a circulator bus to shuttle passengers
between the R Line and the campus. Mr. Abel said that staff
would not envision the circulator becoming an RTD service,
because it was offered as a concession for moving the rail
service.
Director Folska said she would support the motion.

• DRCOG Vanpool Funding Agreement
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that
the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to
execute all documents necessary to enter into an Agreement with the Denver
Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) to provide RTD support and
expansion of the DRCOG Way to Go vanpool program in the Denver
metropolitan area. This agreement is for calendar year 2018 and shall be in
an amount not to exceed $1,058,600.
Motion:

Director Broom made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the December 19, 2017
Board Meeting.
Director Williams seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Mr. Abel explained that RTD had supported the DRCOG
vanpool program since 2001 and that the vanpool program
had previously experienced limited participation due to
perceived high fares, insufficient funding for van acquisition,
difficulties in recruiting drivers, and the lack of funding to
support necessary marketing activities. He added that RTD
and DRCOG entered into a partnership in April of 2001 to
expand vanpool service in the Denver metropolitan area. In
order to make meaningful advances toward meeting shared
goals of offering desirable mobility options, reducing traffic
congestion, and improving air quality in the Denver
metropolitan area. Mr. Abel explained the benefits for RTD
included substantial cost savings from avoidance or
replacement of marginal bus routes with vanpools and also
benefits both RTD and DRCOG were complementary marketing
programs and increased commuter transportation alternatives.
Mr. Abel explained that RTD financial support was used to
help underwrite the vanpool pricing structure in order to make
vanpool fares more competitive in the transportation
marketplace, to provide incentives to attract and retain
vanpool drivers, and to provide capital funding to acquire
necessary rolling stock to provide vanpool services. He stated
that since the advent of RTD support for the vanpool program
in late 2001, the number of vans in service has grown from
11 to 113 active vans.
Director Menten stated that she would be voting no. She
commented that the program should be moved to the private
sector and was competing with public transit.
Director Folska asked how many people were using the service
annually.
Mr. Abel explained that when ridership was examined in terms
of subsidy per passenger boarding the van pool was $3.60
compared to fixed route prices between $5.00 to $7.00 for
various classes of services and was one of the most cost
effective means of moving people in the agencies’ family of
services.
Director Folska asked where the people that used the service
were going.

Mr. Abel stated that the typical rider would meet a group at a
Park-n-Ride and go to an employment site and that the van
pools were very much employment site focused.
Mr. Matthews explained that the van pools commute to places
such as Buckley Air Force Base, the Federal Center, Colorado
Springs, to business north of Denver, and anywhere there was
a major employer in and out of Denver.
Director Folska asked why the vans would travel to Colorado
Springs when that was outside of DRCOG and RTD districts.
Mr. Matthews explained that the subsidy was based only on
the miles within the RTD district.
Director Anderson commented that the vanpools were all going
to the same place and straight to the place of employment.
She added that the program was a benefit to RTD because it
had taken the place of bus routes that had low ridership.
Director Folska asked how many of the vans were wheelchair
accessible.
Mr. Abel explained that there were not any wheelchair
accessible vans in service, but noted that RTD had wheelchair
accessible vans available should there be a demand.
Director Folska stated that she would support the motion.
Director Williams asked if the program included school pool.
Mr. Mathews explained that school pool was a separate
program offered by DRCOG.

• Englewood Art Shuttle Funding Agreement
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that
the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to
execute all documents necessary to enter into a Cost Sharing Agreement
with the City of Englewood to provide RTD financial support for the
operation of the Art circulator bus service in the City of Englewood. This
agreement is for calendar year 2018 and is for an amount not to exceed
$336,208.
Motion:

Director Tisdale made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the December 19, 2017
Board Meeting.
Director Williams seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Mr. Abel explained that in 2003 the City of Englewood applied
for and received a Congestion Mitigation Air Quality (CMAQ)
Grant for a circulator bus service that connected the
Englewood light rail station and Swedish Medical Center/Craig
Hospital. He stated that the grant was approved with funding
available 2004-2007 and the funds were approved for 80% of
the cost of the service. Mr. Abel explained that RTD
contributed 10% of the expense and the City of Englewood
contributed 10% and implemented the Art shuttle in 2004 as
a free service. He added that in September 2007, with the
expiration of the CMAQ grant, RTD took over funding of the
Art shuttle because the high ridership exceeded RTD’s
expectations. Mr. Abel explained that the City of Englewood
continued the management and marketing of the Art shuttle
and that the City of Englewood covered all marketing and
related expenses. He added that the Art shuttle continued to
be a free service sponsored by the City of Englewood and that
the City of Englewood reimbursed RTD for the fares that
would have been paid if the Art shuttle charged a RTD fare.
Mr. Abel stated that in 2018, the Art Shuttle would change its
name and become the Englewood Trolley.
Director Broom asked why it was called the Art.
Director Tisdale explained that Art stands for Area Rapid
Transit.
Director Folska stated that the Art shuttle assisted with the
first and last mile issues and that other areas should look into

a similar program. She added that she was in support of the
program.

• Exercise Option for On-Vehicle Advertising Contract
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that the
General Manager or his designee be authorized to exercise the one-time
extension with Lamar Advertising of Denver [Lamar] for the two-year period
January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2019. Under the terms of the
recommended action, Lamar would remit to RTD either 1) a minimum
guarantee of $3.4 million in 2018 and $3.4 million in 2019 or 2) seventy
percent of net sales, whichever is greater.
Motion:

Director Williams made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the December 19, 2017
Board Meeting.
Director Tisdale seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager of Communications,
stated that he would take questions from the Directors.
Director Williams asked if RTD paid Lamar for advertising on
the back of RTD buses.
Adrian Mabry, Manager of Projects, Contracts, and Marketing,
stated that it did not cost the agency to advertise on RTD
buses.
Director Williams asked if the agency approved what goes on
the buses.
Mr. Reed explained that RTD did not reject advertising unless
an advertisement violates RTD policy and as long as it fell
within a commercial advertisement realm.

Mr. Asphaug explained that RTD had a limited forum that
accepted commercial advertising and would not accept
nonprofit advertising for causes or political viewpoints.
Director Lubow asked how the amount of $3.4 million was
determined.
Mr. Reed explained that with the guarantee in the two-year
extension the minimum revenue would be $3.4 million each
year and that Lamar has delivered the minimum revenue
guarantee each year without incident. He added that the
amount was less than had been expected based on prior
years.
Director Broom asked if there were any advertisements that
were off limits.
Mr. Mabry stated that RTD advertisement guidelines were very
specific to determine what was allowed to be advertised on
RTD buses. He added that there were specific set of items
that were not allowed at all and then areas that RTD had ruled
out.
Director Broom asked about advertising for a non-smoking
campaign.
Mr. Reed explained that would fall under nonprofit and would
not be allowed. He added that approximately six years ago the
Board voted to allow alcohol advertising.
Mr. Asphaug added that the agency must look at each type of
advertisement to determine if it fits into the policy.
Director Menten asked if it was a nonprofit advertisement that
it would be rejected.
Mr. Asphaug read the advertising policy that can be found on
the RTD website.
Director Menten asked if RTD would allow a public service
announcement.
Mr. Asphaug explained that the current policy does allow the
agency to accept public service advertisements from local,

state, or federal governmental agencies regarding public
programs, services, or events.
Director Menten asked when RTD the changes at Denver
Union Station regarding directional signage and advertisement
would be implemented.
General Manager Genova stated the request for expressions of
interest was on his desk for review. He added that once it
had been reviewed it would be advertised as an RFP and
included digital advertising at Denver Union Station.
Director Menten asked about the emails sent out to attend
games and events and if RTD received funding for the
advertising through the emails.
Mr. Mabry explained that the emails were specials offered
from organizations to RTD employees to attend at a
discounted rate.
Director Menten stated that RTD was advertising for those
organizations benefit.
Mr. Reed explained that the emails were an internal email only.
Director Menten stated that it took time away from the
employees’ and Directors’ day to read or answer those emails.
Director Folska asked if
advertisements on the bus

the

agency

placed

recruiting

General Manager Genova stated that RTD did place recruitment
advertisements on buses.
Director Folska stated she would support the motion.
