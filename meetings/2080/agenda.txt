UNANIMOUS CONSENT
A. Agreement for the Master Planning of Property in the Yale Station area at E. Yale
Avenue/Yale Circle, Denver, Colorado
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to negotiate and execute
all documents necessary to formalize an agreement between the Regional
Transportation District and the Yale TOD Partners for the purpose of developing a
Transit-Oriented Master Plan for the Yale Station area that would include parcels of
land currently owned by Koelbel and Company, Mile High Development and the
Urban Land Conservancy. The agreement will provide for an exclusive cooperation
period of time not to exceed twelve months and will further provide that the master
planning process will be at the sole cost and expense of the Yale TOD Partners.
B. Agreement for the Exclusive Cooperative Planning related to RTD property adjacent to
the Alameda Station Light Rail Station, Cherokee and Alaska Place, Denver, Colorado
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to negotiate and execute all
documents necessary to formalize an agreement between the Regional Transportation
District and D4 Urban LLC, a Colorado limited liability company for the purpose of the
creation of specific plans for the coordinated development of the property owned and
property currently leased by RTD and the approximately 60 acres of real property
adjacent to or nearby the RTD Alameda tracts owned by D4 Urban, LLC. The agreement
will provide for an exclusive cooperation period of time not to exceed twelve months and
will further provide that the creation of more specific plans for the coordinated
development of the RTD Alameda property and the D4 property will be at the sole cost
and expense of D4 Urban LLC.
C. Payphone Management Directive
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of
Directors adopt a policy to not require pay phones at stations and park-n-rides except
where a specific need has been identified.
D.

Agreement for funding the Belleview Call-n-ride
It is recommended by the Operations & Customer Services Committee that the Board
of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee, to execute all documents
necessary to enter into an Agreement with the South East Business Partnership
(SEBP) and/or South I-25 Urban Corridor Transportation Management Association
(SEUCTMA) for SEBP/SEUCTMA to provide local match funding to RTD for the
Belleview Call-n-Ride. This Agreement is for the period 2012-2014.

XII.

E.

Agreement for funding the Federal Heights Call-n-Ride
It is recommended by the Operations & Customer Services Committee that the Board
of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee, to execute all documents
necessary for RTD to enter into an Agreement with the Cities of Federal Heights,
Northglenn, Thornton and Adams County for the assignment of the CMAQ grant
awarded to the City of Federal Heights to operate a new Call-n-Ride service to the
RTD in order for RTD to provide the service and for the Cities and County to provide
local match funding to RTD for the Federal Heights Call-n-Ride. This Agreement is for
the period 2012-2014.

F.

Adoption of 2012 Performance Measures
It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the
Board of Directors adopt the 2012 Performance Measures for Goals 1-7.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
G. Establish Policy for RTD Competitive Grants
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of
Directors adopt a policy that specifies that all future grant funds be used for already
planned base system projects, such as capital improvements or service increases. In
the case of FasTracks projects, from this point forward, all grant funds matched using
RTD FasTracks funds should be applied against the applicable corridor budget to fill
the FasTracks funding gap. Adoption of this policy will require staff to:
a. pursue any grant funds that can help close the FasTracks program funding gap and
account for those funds as such;
b. assure that any grant funds awarded to a FasTracks project will be applied to that
project’s base budget wherever possible, not for enhancements or out-of-scope items;
c. for the Base System, advance at least one of the following needs: operational
improvements, cost effectiveness, or safety/security improvement;
d. retain sole discretion in determining which grant opportunities satisfy the criteria listed
in (a and b) above. However RTD staff, at its sole discretion, may pursue grants for
enhancements so long as that grant cannot be used to help close the FasTracks
funding gap.
Any additional grants or other funding obtained by other parties, in support of any
FasTracks project as defined in that project’s environmental document, will not reduce
the RTD FasTracks commitment to that project without prior agreement among all
parties involved. In this situation, RTD would not be responsible for, nor provide, any
funds for local funding match without approval from the RTD Board of Directors.
Additionally, it is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the
Board of Directors direct staff to:
a. Case #1: If stakeholders do not agree that DRCOG’s $60 million Second Commitment
in Principle can be used to fund the existing FasTracks project scope, then RTD will
request that DRCOG require each corridor’s stakeholders to apply for the designated
$60 million Second Commitment in Principle on their own, thereby providing the
stakeholders more flexibility on how these funds are spent and removing RTD from
the responsibility of coordinating stakeholder consensus;

b. Case #2: Allow an exception for accounting for the $20 million DRCOG TIP funds and
$4 million in FASTER funds that that were previously awarded to RTD for US 36
since at the time of the award, no formal policy on this matter was in place.
