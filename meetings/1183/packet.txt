BACKGROUND
The purpose of this memorandum is to request an amendment to the 2013 Adopted Budget. This
amendment will account for capital carryforward adjustments from 2012 to 2013. The amendment also
will detail other adjustments to the capital budget and adjustments to the operating and administrative
budget.
DISCUSSION
Overview of the 2013 Budget Amendment
The total proposed appropriation for the 2013 Amended Budget and the changes from the 2013
Adopted Budget are summarized in the first set of tables above.
2013 Operating Expense Adjustments
The operating and administrative expense portion of the proposed budget amendment reflects an
increase of $18.2 million from the 2013 Adopted Budget. This increase consists of $17.2 million on the
Base System and $3.3 million in FasTracks Project/Construction, offset by a decrease of $2.3 million on
FasTracks Operations (West Line). Of the total increase, $5.5 million is attributed to previously
approved transfers. On the Base System, the true increase to operating expenses is less than 1% net of
previously approved transfers, the FISA contribution, and one-time expenses.
Shown in detail on the attached Amendment A, net changes are summarized below.
Base System
Bus Operations
 Net decrease of $0.321 million from diesel lock savings offset by August runboard increase
Rail Operations
 Net increase of $1.0 million for increases in system traction power, traction power and repair parts
transferred from West Line net of cost allocation, and staff additions for signal/traction power
maintainers and supervisors in conjunction with rail line expansion
Private Carrier Operations
 Net increase of $1.4 million from shortfall in the original fuel budget, additional BroncosRide service,
and incentive payments to private carriers

Safety, Security & Facilities-FasTracks Operations
 Net decrease of $0.875 million from favorable adjustment to security contracts cost, security costs
transferred to Base net of cost allocation, and adjustment of West Line budget to actuals for Jan-Apr
Interest Expense
Interest expense is projected to increase $19.9 million on a combined basis. Of the increase, Base
system interest is projected to increase $5.3 million due to issuance of COP debt in 2013 to finance
replacement and expansion of the bus fleet. FasTracks interest expense is projected to increase $14.6
million due to restructuring of interest payments from sales tax revenue bond refinancing in 2013, which
includes non-cash amortization of expenditures on prior debt carried forward. Capitalized interest is
projected to remain stable.
2013 New Capital
The new capital portion of the proposed budget amendment reflects a decrease of $15.7 million to the
2013 Adopted Budget. These changes result from program changes that have occurred since the 2013
Budget was adopted, and include the following significant changes:
FasTracks
FasTracks new capital had a decrease of $20.7 million due to alignment of corridor funding with updated
timing, adjustments for grant funding, changes in cost estimates, and completion of projects. Please see
Attachment B for detail.
Base System
New capital expenditures increased $5.0 million on the Base System. Please see Attachment B for
detail.
Previously Approved Capital Carryforward Adjustments
For the 2013 Adopted Budget, year-to-date actual expenditures as of 9/30/12 were used to compute the
estimate of the carryforward. This methodology is used to accommodate the timing of the adoption of
the annual budget.
Previously approved capital carryforward has been decreased by $247.9 million from the 2013 Adopted
Budget to reflect fourth quarter 2012 actual expenditures, transfers to reclassify certain capital projects
as expense projects, previously approved transfers, completion of projects, and project scope changes.
The FasTracks portion was a decrease of $229.3 million and the Base System decrease was $18.5
million. Please see Attachment C for detail.

Revenue Changes
Revenues are projected to increase $19.0 million on a combined basis.
 Sales and Use Tax revenues are projected to decrease $8.8 million based on the CU-Leeds School
June forecast of 3.7% vs. 4.2% in the Adopted Budget from CU-Leeds earlier forecast.

Packet Pg. 8

1.B.1






Federal grant revenues, including operating grants, capital grants, capital maintenance, FASTER
grants, CMAQ grants, and other grants are projected to increase $22.8 million over amounts
projected in the 2013 Adopted Budget. This reflects increasing allocations in formula grant
appropriations over the 2013 Adopted Budget and some new programs in 2013 as well as
increases in CMAQ capital grants for FasTracks.
Fare revenue is projected to remain flat in the Amended Budget over the Adopted Budget based
on current year actuals.
Other income is projected to increase $4.3 million due primarily to sale of the Civic Center air
rights.

Unrestricted Year-End Fund Balance

The Unrestricted Year-End Fund Balance is projected to decrease $7.8 million from the Adopted Budget
to $23.0 million reflecting amended budget increases, year-end accruals and the net pension obligation.

FasTracks Contingency Reserve
The proposed 2013 Amended Budget reflects continued maintenance of the FasTracks Contingency
Reserve at a balance of $30 million. This reserve is appropriated annually, and is used to fund any
changes in the FasTracks schedule that could not be forecast at the time of adoption of the annual
budget. The purpose of this reserve is to allow the District to accommodate minor changes to the
FasTracks schedule without requiring frequent budget amendments to draw funds from the FasTracks
Future Construction Reserve. The Reserve has been carried at $30 million since 2010 and remains at
that level in both this Amended Budget and the 2013 Adopted Budget.
Budget Transfers
The proposed 2013 Amended Budget reflects year-to-date budget transfers executed within the General
Manager’s authority or by prior authorization of the Board of Directors. The District’s budget transfer
policy was adopted by the Board of Directors on 2/26/85 and further amended on 1/1/93, 5/15/08 and
4/1/10. The policy states that cumulative transfers between projects in amounts exceeding $250,000
require prior approval of the Board of Directors.
Cost Recovery Ratio
The proposed 2013 Amended Budget meets the cost recovery ratio mandated by the Colorado General
Assembly. The estimated SB154 recovery ratio (all nontax revenue except ADA farebox revenues
divided by all expenditures, including depreciation, except ADA expenditures and expenditures incurred
for long-term planning and development of rapid transit infrastructure) exceeds the annual target of 30%
mandated by the General Assembly. The RTD operating revenue recovery ratio (operating revenues
except ADA farebox revenues divided by the same cost basis as the Colorado General Assembly) is
estimated to exceed the 20% target established by the Board of Directors.

Fund Balance Policy

Packet Pg. 9

1.B.1

The proposed 2013 Amended Budget includes a reserve of 3% of annual spending as defined in Article
X, Section 20 of the Colorado Constitution (the TABOR reserve). The proposed 2013 Amended Budget
maintains a Board-Appropriated Fund, Capital Replacement Fund, and Unrestricted Year-End Fund
balance in the District's working capital.
Basis of Accounting and Budgeting
The accounts of the District are reported using the accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are
recognized when earned and expenses are recognized when incurred. The District’s basis of budgeting
follows the accrual basis of accounting except (1) capital outlays and payments of principal are treated
as expenditures, and (2) depreciation and gains and losses on disposal of property and equipment are
excluded.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Amend the 2013 Budget to reflect the capital project changes and the adjustments to the operating
budget. This is the recommended action.
2. Request staff to revise the proposed amendments to the 2013 Budget and amend the budget with
revisions.
3. Do not amend the 2013 Budget. This is not recommended, because the 2013 Adopted Budget does
not reflect the capital carryforward adjustments, capital budget adjustments, and material changes to
the operating and administrative budget.

Subject:

First Quarter 2013 Performance Measures

POLICY REFERENCE
Fiscal Policy Statements – Budget Policy 10

DISCUSSION
Attached is the 2013 Performance Report for the First Quarter. These year-to-date measures
provide a framework in which RTD determines how well it provides service to its passengers and
the citizens of the District. Of the 23 performance measures tracked, RTD met 17 of the goals in
their entirety in the first quarter; however, improvement is occurring in certain categories. The
following is a discussion of the performance measures not met.
Goal 1.1 – First Transit-Commerce City exceeded the goal for number of passenger accidents per
100,000 miles. It is not unusual for a higher number of accidents to occur in Q1 during inclement
weather and the majority of these accidents were found to be non-preventable. While Veolia did
not meet this measure during 2012, it showed strong improvement in Q1 and met this goal. The
contractors continue implementation of DriveCam and Smart Drive technologies to help operators
improve/correct driving practices and provided Smith System retraining to all operators in 2012.
Goal 2.1 – Average facility maintenance complaints per month exceeded the goal of 10.5, primarily
due to snow/ice complaints in Q1. We expect the complaints will begin to decline in Q2 and the
trend should continue downward through the remainder of the year.
Goal 3.1 - The District as a whole did not meet its goal for on-time service in Q1, however, we are
experiencing improvement in all categories and for all carriers. In local on-time bus service, only
First Transit-Commerce City and Veolia did not meet goal but both showed improvement over last
year. Regional and Express Service bus on-time performance, only slightly below goal, also
improved over 2012. Staff continues to study individual route and driver performance in order to
target remedial actions and resources to the routes experiencing the greatest challenges. As the
focus on run boards continues, on-time performance is showing positive trends.
Light rail on-time service was above goal in Q1 and has shown steady improvement, recovering
from last year’s issues which included a record number of new train operators brought on in a short
period and a traction power substation software upgrade that resulted in multiple substations being
off-line.

Packet Pg. 33

1.C.2

Goal 4.2 – We have seen customer complaints increase across the entire system over the past two
years due to several factors including the fare enforcement campaign, the stroller policy, and
heavy/longer load times. The level of complaints has been consistent and is not increasing. Top
reasons continue to be “bus did not show,” “bus early,” “bus late” and “operator discourtesy.”
Staff continues to review CAD/AVL playbacks to determine the validity of these complaints and to
work with operators to address valid complaints. Staff provides an analysis of complaints as part
of the Operations/Customer Services report.
Goal 6.2 – The District did not meet its overall increase in ridership goal in Q1. Ridership was
affected by the extra day last year in February due to leap year, and ridership on local routes has
been declining.
Goal 6.3 – The District did not meet its goal for overall increase in fare revenue in Q1. We are seeing a
decrease in fare revenue in the short-term for cash-paying customers who predominate on local routes,
but we anticipate the situation will reverse through the remainder of the year. EcoPass, CollegePass and
annual pass revenue is steady and actually increased in the quarter.

An accident is considered preventable any time the operator was not driving in full compliance with all applicable laws and
regulations and in such a manner as to avoid involvement despite adverse conditions of road, weather or traffic or the errors of
pedestrians or other drivers.
2
It is not unusual for a greater number of accidents to occur during Q1 inclement weather. In addition, the majority of the
accidents were found to be non-preventable. First Transit-Commerce City continues implementation of DriveCam and Smart
Drive technologies to help operations improve driving practices.

On-time is arrival at a location no more than 1 minute early and no more than 5 minutes after the scheduled arrival time.
2
The measure is lowered in 2013 due to system complexity added by the West Line, which will bring with it more single-track
chokepoints on the west end of the line and more crossing points in the CPV. Delays are also coming from signal timing
changes in the downtown district which is affecting performance.
3
We continue to experience improvement in on-time service system-wide for all carriers. Staff continues to study individual
route and driver performance in order to target remedial actions and resources to the routes experiencing the greatest
challenges. On-time performance is showing improvement as the focus continues on the run-boards.

Top complaints are “bus did not show,” “bus early,” “bus late” and “operator discourtesy.” Staff continues to review CAD/AVL
playbacks to determine the validity of these complaints and to work with operators to address valid complaints. Staff provides an
analysis of complaints as part of the Operations/Customer Services report. Customer complaints increased across the entire
system due to several factors including the fare enforcement campaign, the stroller policy, and heavier/longer load times; this
higher level of complaints has been consistent for the last 2 years and is not increasing.
