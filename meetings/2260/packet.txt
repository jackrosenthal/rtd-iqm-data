Board Meeting Date: March 24, 2015

Subject:

Request for Increase to SmartCard Contract
and Budget Transfer

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to increase the Xerox Transport Solutions contract not-toexceed amount by $1,300,000 to a new contract amount not-to-exceed $21,031,382 and to authorize
a budget transfer of up to $3,800,000 to fund activities under this contract.
DISCUSSION
Staff is seeking Board authorization to increase the Xerox SmartCard contract by $1,300,000 in order to
expand the scope of the contract to include work that was not originally anticipated at that stage of the
project.
Staff is also seeking authorization to provide funding through a budget transfer of up to
$3,800,000 to fund this additional $1,300,000 of work as well for those work items previously
approved by the Board in October 2014.
The following new activities are proposed to be added to the scope of work of the Xerox contract:
Bus validators for Call-n-Ride vehicles- SmartCard validators have been installed and are being used on
fixed route buses. RTD planned to install SmartCard validators on approximately 60 Call-n-Ride vehicles
in the future. With the proposed fare structure recommended for implementation in 2016, it will be
necessary to install SmartCard readers on Call-n-Ride vehicles sooner than initially planned as transfers
will be eliminated and SmartCards and day passes will become the primary sources of payment. Call-nRide vehicles must be equipped with SmartCard validators to accommodate the new fare structure.
Funding of $800,000 under the Xerox contract will be necessary.
SmartCard Hosting - RTD is working with Xerox to provide a hosting solution for its SmartCard
technology. Xerox provides hosting services for other agencies using SmartCard technology and has the
in-house expertise and systems to provide this service to RTD. In order to facilitate the transfer of
hosting RTD’s SmartCard technology, additional scope of work of $500,000 under the Xerox contract
may be necessary.
In addition to these new activities, in October 2014, the Board of Directors authorized an increase in the
Xerox contract to include $2,349,912 of new work items. Board authorization is now being requested
to fund those items through a budget transfer as follows:
Additional web portal and process system changes are necessary to complete the SmartCard
functionality needed for the remaining project elements such as stored value, monthly passes and backend coding to accommodate the proposed fare structure. Funding necessary for this functionality is
$1,300,000.

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

Additional owner’s representative services are necessary to complete the remaining project elements for
the SmartCard project including business process development and additional guidance and oversight for
implementation. Funding necessary for these services is $1,200,000.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The estimated unfunded cost of completing the above items is $3,800,000. Funding is available from
proceeds already received from the issuance of Certificates of Participation (COPs) in which certain of
those proceeds are not currently needed for their original intent such as the purchase of Mall Shuttles.
Therefore, there would be no budgetary impact; rather a transfer of funds would be completed from
other projects to the SmartCard project. This funding will be backfilled through the 2015 amended
budget process.

ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the General Manager or his designee to increase the Xerox Transport Solutions contract
not-to-exceed amount by $1,300,000 to a new contract amount not to exceed $21,031,382 and
authorize a budget transfer of up to $3,800,000. This is the recommended action.
2. Do not authorize the General Manager or his designee to increase the Xerox Transport Solutions
contract not-to-exceed amount by $1,300,000 to a new contract amount not to exceed
$21,031,382 and complete a budget transfer of $3,800,000. This is not the recommended
action because RTD would be unable to complete and implement the SmartCard system or the
new fare structure.

Subject:

Authorization to execute a budget transfer to
purchase thermal printers

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute a budget transfer in an amount up to
$1,900,000 from the Mall Shuttle project in order to purchase and install the equipment necessary to
accommodate the sale of fare media under the proposed fare structure.
BACKGROUND
RTD has proposed a modified and simplified fare structure to the Board to be enacted in January 2016.
Under the new fare structure, it is proposed that transfers be eliminated and a day pass be offered to
customers for purchase on board RTD buses. The day pass is proposed to be priced at two times the
single fare and would allow a customer to have unlimited rides during a service day, thereby not
requiring a rider to purchase a fare at each transfer.

DISCUSSION
In order to make the day pass widely available to RTD’s patrons, the ability to purchase day passes is
needed at the location where a patron accesses RTD’s services either on buses or at rail platforms. RTD
currently has the ability to sell day passes at rail platforms through ticket vending machines (TVMs) and
at sales outlets but currently does not have the ability to offer day passes to patrons who purchase their
first fare upon entering a bus. In order to offer a day pass on buses, a thermal printer would be installed
in each bus whereby a customer would pay for the day pass through the farebox and the operator would
produce a day pass from the thermal printer. The day pass will be printed on watermarked paper and
would clearly indicate the service day for which it is valid.
Although the Board has not yet authorized RTD to implement the new fare structure, authority to enter a
contract for the purchase and installation of thermal printers is being sought at this time due to the lead
time necessary to complete this procurement to meet the January 2016 fare structure implementation. If
the final Board action approving changes to RTD’s 2016 fare policy does not include a day pass, thus
negating the need for thermal printers, this funding will not be used.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The estimated cost of installing thermal printers on each of the approximately 1,000 buses in the RTD
fleet is $1,900,000. This cost includes the equipment as well as the connections and installation
necessary to tie the printers into the RTD network.
The funding necessary for this procurement would come from a portion of the Certificate of Participation
(COP) proceeds that were authorized by the Board to be used for the replacement of Mall Shuttles.

Packet Pg. 5

1.B.2

Therefore, there would be no need to seek additional funding for this procurement and no budgetary
impact other than the transfer of funds from one project to another. These funds will be backfilled
through the 2015 amended budget process.

ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute a budget transfer in order to
purchase and install the equipment necessary to accommodate the sale of fare media under
the proposed 2016 fare structure. This action grants authority to execute a budget transfer in
an amount not to exceed $1,900,000 from the Mall Shuttle project. This is the recommended
action.
2. Do not authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute a budget transfer. This action
would result in RTD’s inability to procure needed day pass fare media equipment in time to
provide the ability for patrons to purchase day passes on buses and avoid multiple fare payments
for transfers. This is not the recommended action.

SmartCard Project Update

Stored Value is a product that can be purchased by the general public to pay for transit fares on fixed
route buses and rail platforms. Stored Value is provided on reloadable plastic cards encoded with chips.
These cards can be loaded with certain dollar amounts and used much like a debit card. Once the card is
loaded, it can be used to board bus or rail until the dollar amount on the card is less than the fare
needed. Additional value can be loaded onto the card. The target date to provide stored value cards for
the current fare structure is November 1, 2015. These cards and services are planned to be available at
RTD and merchant sales locations. Through early 2016, this will be followed by: enabling the public
facing web portal allowing online registration of cards, purchasing and reloading cards; incorporating
new fare structure; and deploying period passes.

Fourth Quarter 2014 Performance Measures

POLICY REFERENCE
Fiscal Policy Statements – Budget Policy 10
DISCUSSION
Attached is the Performance Report for the Fourth Quarter 2014. These year-to-date measures
provide a framework in which RTD determines how well it provides service to its passengers and the
citizens of the District. Of the 23 performance measures tracked, RTD met 17 of the goals in their
entirety in the fourth quarter. The following are the exceptions to goals:
Goal 1.4 – Number of Light Rail Accidents
The average number of light rail accidents per month of 7.3 exceeded the goal of ≤ 6.0. An
unusually high number of low-dollar incidents occurred in Q4 which affected the measure for the full
year. In Q4, 21 incidents were reported, but only one was deemed preventable. The remainder
were non-preventable and the fault of others.
Goal 3.1 – System-Wide On-Time Performance
The District did not meet its goals as a whole for on-time service in Q4 and performance acrossthe-board was generally flat from Q3. However, with the exception of First Transit-Commerce City
in Local Service, full year 2014 results show positive trends over 2013. Staff continues to study
the worst performing routes and identify the resources needed to improve.
Goal 4.2 – Level of Customer Complaints
The average time for final resolution of customer complaints weakened slightly in Q4 and reached
10.68 days for the year, above goal of ≤ 10 days. We found that final resolution time for the
private carriers was higher than for RTD and they made up 1/3 of the total number of contacts filed.
In two of our newly re-bid private contracts, the private carriers are now required to have a
dedicated customer service person to deal with complaint investigation and response. A staffing
increase at RTD recently took effect as well to assist the contracted carriers with their
responsiveness. Customer Care also changed some processes and procedures during February of
2015 and states that contractor response times were cut in half.
We have seen customer complaints increase across the entire system over the past 2-3 years due
to several factors including the fare enforcement campaign, the stroller policy, and heavy/longer
load time, but the level of complaints has been consistent. Staff continues to review CAD/AVL
playbacks to determine the validity of these complaints and to work with operators to address the
valid issues. In Q4, the three carriers RTD, First Transit-Commerce City and First Transit-Longmont
met or exceeded goal. Both Veolia and First Transit-Denver remained static and marginally outside
of goal. Staff provides an analysis of complaints as part of the Operations/Customer Services
report.

Packet Pg. 34

1.C.4

Goal 5.1 – ADA On-Time Performance
In Q4, the measure was weakened slightly and was below goal. The ADA carriers have found it
difficult to hire qualified operators.
Job fairs and advertisement efforts are proceeding.
Noteworthy is that on-time performance data collection is being generated on-line and is more
accurate.
Goal 6.3 – Fare Revenue, EcoPass Revenue, and Total Revenue
The District did not meet its goal for overall increase in operating revenue in 2014, largely due to
fare revenue. While fare revenue is ahead of 2013, fare revenue fell short of the budgeted goal for
2014. The effects of lower ridership than anticipated on the West Line and falling gas prices in Q4
accounted for this divergence from budget. The 2015 budget goal is adjusted downward for these
effects.
Goal 6.5 – Bus Operator/Mechanic Headcount within Authorization
RTD exceeded its vacancies goal in bus mechanics and the Q4 vacancy rate is higher than Q3. We
are experiencing a high level of vacancies in this category and recruitment efforts including job fairs
and college fairs are on-going. Vacancies are due to retirements, system growth, and the strong
local economy.

The goal was increased in 2013 due to the addition of the West Line which will add 30% to the overall system and 25 more
grade-crossings, coupled with no operating history on the new line.

Final resolution time for the private carriers is higher than for RTD and they make up 1/3 of the total number of contacts filed. A
staffing increase (1) at RTD recently took effect to assist the contracted carriers with their responsiveness. In two of our new
contracts, the private carriers are required to have a dedicated customer service person to deal with complaint investigation and
response.
3
Staff continues to review CAD/AVL playbacks to determine the validity of complaints and to work with operations to address
them. Staff provides an analysis of complaints as part of the Operations/Customer Services report. For Q4, carriers RTD, FirstTransit Commerce City and First Transit-Longmont met or exceeded goal. Veolia and First Transit-Denver were slightly outside of
goal.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

From:

Doug MacLeod, Controller

GM

Date:

March 12, 2015

Board Meeting Date: March 17, 2015

Subject:

Fiscal
Sustainability
Recommendations Update

Task

Force

BACKGROUND
A Fiscal Sustainability Task Force (Task Force) was formed in November 2010 for the purpose of making
recommendations detailing opportunities for operating efficiencies and revenue enhancement for the
Base System to ensure RTD’s long-term fiscal sustainability. The Task Force consisted of 22 members
with 12 of those members being external to RTD.
The Task Force presented its written
recommendations to the Board of Directors in June 2011. The Board of Directors subsequently
approved those recommendations and directed Staff to pursue implementation of each recommendation.
The Task Force reconvened for a final meeting in July 2012 to be briefed on the progress of their
recommendations and provide an opportunity for feedback.
DISCUSSION
The Task Force made revenue enhancement, expense reduction and fiscal policy recommendations to
the Board of Directors which were approved for further consideration and/or implementation. The status
of those Task Force recommendations is as follows:
Recommendations - Completed
Removing the Volatility from Sales and Use Tax Projections
RTD contracted with the University of Colorado, Leeds School of Business – Business Research Division
(Leeds) to provide sales and use tax forecasts beginning in March 2011. Each quarter, Leeds provides a
forecast containing short-term (one year by quarter), medium-term (six year SBP period) and long-term
(30 year APE period) sales and use tax projections. This was implemented to provide RTD with expert
economic analysis and sales and use tax forecasts using sophisticated financial modeling techniques not
available internally. These forecasts are intended to provide a better analysis of RTD’s expected sales
and use tax collections which comprise approximately 2/3 of RTD’s recurring revenues.
Service Optimization
In 2012, RTD implemented modifications and reductions in service representing approximately $10.7
million or an 8% net reduction in service. Service optimization was recommended by the Task Force and
implemented with Board approval in order to match services provided with available funding sources.
Since that time, some service has been gradually restored as needed within budgetary constraints.
Fund Balance Policy
Due to the volatility of RTD’s largest single revenue source, sales and use taxes, the Task Force
recommended implementation of a more robust fiscal policy regarding fund balances. Fund balances
represent financial assets that are available to RTD after allowing for obligations that have been incurred.
Fund balances increase when fund sources exceed fund uses and vice versa. Fund balances, therefore,
exist as a form of savings account to be used for specific purposes when needed and replenished when
economic circumstances allow. In response to this recommendation, RTD implemented a fund balance

Packet Pg. 49

1.C.6

policy with a target level of $90 million for the Base System, which is approximately three months of
operating expenses. This target was established based on levels recommended by the Government
Finance Officers Association (GFOA) best practices. The Fund Balance Policy further categorizes the
available fund balances into the categories of a Board Restricted Fund, a Capital Replacement Fund and
an Unrestricted Fund. At FYE 12/31/14, unaudited combined fund balances (including FasTracks)
totaled $35.8 million. This amount is preliminary for the year and further adjustments will be made.
Sales and Use Tax Exemptions
In Colorado, legislation establishes products and services that are subject to sales and use taxation and
those that are exempt from taxation. The state, cities, municipalities and special districts in Colorado
each have different sales and use tax rates and often have differing items subject to taxation due to
legislation establishing exemptions. Exemption parity was identified by the Task Force as providing a
benefit to RTD during difficult economic conditions when the state implements exemption changes and
vice versa. In addition, exemption parity removes the complexity to vendors of RTD having different
taxable items than the state. RTD introduced legislation that was passed in May 2013 to establish
parity with the state regarding items subject to sales and use taxation. Exemption parity took effect
1/1/14. RTD estimates that parity generated a net increase of $2.7 million in 2014 based on 2012
figures, however, this will be difficult to track due to the way vendors report sales tax components.
Technology and Energy Innovation
RTD conducted a comprehensive energy audit of the oldest and largest operating division (the Platte
facility) to determine the potential scope of savings that may be available through equipment and lighting
upgrades. The audit identified that facility lighting upgrades could result in potentially significant energy
savings. Areas for minor energy savings were identified for other building systems; however, these have
a very significant capital investment and long pay-back periods. RTD budgets for energy upgrades
throughout the District in the Strategic Budget Plan, and we will continue to address energy efficiency in
building systems as on-going projects are completed. RTD received a grant to install solar panels at East
Metro and this project is completed. Facilities Maintenance has also done lighting upgrades replacing
older metal-halide fixtures with energy-efficient fluorescent fixtures at the East Metro, Boulder, and
District Shops operating facilities. We are now able to quantify our savings and are realizing average
savings of approximately $3,000/month at East Metro due to the combination of solar and lighting
upgrades; Boulder is showing approximately $500/month in savings with a lighting upgrade, and to date
District Shops is even.
Recommendations – Ongoing
Sales and Use Tax Compliance Reviews
The Colorado Department of Revenue (DOR) collects and audits sales and use taxes for RTD. The Task
Force identified an opportunity for revenue enhancement by performing additional sales and use tax
compliance reviews based on the favorable collection experiences of Colorado cities and municipalities
that implemented these reviews. Compliance reviews consist of RTD providing additional resources
from a contracted provider to supplement the DOR’s audit function and is intended to provide the DOR
with the additional resources necessary to ensure complete and timely tax compliance by vendors. RTD
contracted with Revenue Recovery Group (RRG), an audit firm with substantial experience providing
compliance review services to several Colorado municipalities, and the program began in April 2014. To
date, 75 compliance reviews have been approved to be undertaken by RRG. Additional compliance
reviews were terminated during discovery due to a determination of collection potential. Of the 75
undertaken, 15 are being scheduled, 52 are ongoing and 8 are complete. While the 8 completed
compliance reviews must still undergo a review and approval process by DOR, assessments total
$433,961 vs. costs of $286,423. It should be noted that review completions and assessments, if any,

Packet Pg. 50

1.C.6

lag the costs incurred. We continue to work with RRG and DOR to identify additional compliance review
opportunities.
Naming Rights
The Board approved RTD securing the services of a corporate sponsorship and naming rights consultant,
and RTD entered into a contract with the internationally known firm IMG. IMG presented to the Board in
2013 an inventory and financial analysis of RTD facilities, services, and assets that may lend themselves
to naming/sponsorship value-added contracts. IMG completed the valuation of RTD assets for corporate
sponsorships and naming rights and was given the green light to begin pursuing potential clients.
Following the public launch of the program in the third quarter of last year, contractor IMG has been
actively meeting with potential partners. Any proposed naming rights/corporate sponsorship contract
will be brought to the RTD Board for approval.
Partnerships and Privatization
The Task Force described this recommendation as a broad area that could include items such as
privatizing routes and administrative and operational functions to reduce expenses. RTD has undertaken
some actions under this recommendation such as the lease of the DUS historic building, IGAs for
improvements to US36 and the East Line, as well as TOD activities. RTD continues to look for
partnership and privatization opportunities on an ongoing basis.
Recommendations – Low Near-Term Priority
Recommendations made by the Task Force and categorized at the 2012 Board Retreat as having lower
near-term priority and their status are as follows:
Charge for Parking
RTD currently charges out-of-District patrons parking fees to use parking facilities as well as fees
charged to in-District patrons parking for longer than 24 hours. The Task Force identified charging
parking fees to all patrons as a possible revenue enhancement source. This recommendation could be
perceived as a fare increase. In 2013, the state legislation regarding RTD charging for parking was
amended to allow a third party to charge in-District patrons as long as RTD receives no revenue.
Tolling and Managed Lanes
The Task Force recommended investigating the possibility of RTD generating additional revenues
through charges for tolling and managed lanes.
Enacting this recommendation would require
coordination with CDOT and other agencies. The US36 BRT project is an example of how tolling and
managed lanes can enhance RTD operations and save costs. The agreement guarantees running times,
allows for bus on shoulder operations to facilitate schedule adherence on local service, and provides for
maintenance of managed lanes with no contribution from RTD. Prior to entering into agreements with
CDOT for managed lanes, RTD contributed to maintenance and snow removal on the I-25 HOV lanes.
Home Rule Initiative
The Task Force recommended that RTD consider becoming a “Home Rule” entity which would allow
RTD to collect and audit its sales and use taxes instead of the DOR. This initiative would require
legislation. RTD met several times with the DOR to discuss this initiative as well as sales and use tax
compliance reviews. Although the DOR did not object to RTD performing these services itself, the
Colorado Municipal League and other entities recommended against it. “Home Rule” is a state
constitutional authorization for creating municipalities. It could only be secured for RTD by statewide
constitutional amendment. As discussed earlier in this report, RTD has entered into an agreement with
DOR to facilitate better tax compliance and monitoring, which has been coupled with simplification of
state and RTD taxation through legislation that provides for uniformity on items taxed.

Access-a-Ride/Cab 4th Quarter Report

Ridership
Access-a-Ride ridership increased by 2% through the 4th quarter of 2014 compared to the same period
of 2013. Productivity decreased from 1.24 to 1.22 passengers per hour. During the same period,
Access-a-Cab ridership increased by 4%. The increased use of Access-a-Cab by Access-a-Ride
passengers allows RTD to accommodate increased total program ridership while limiting the need to
increase resources devoted to Access-a-Ride. Combined Access-a-Ride and Access-a-Cab ridership
increased by 2% compared to 2013. Total boardings increased from 872,980 total boardings thru Q4
of 2013 to 891,430 total boardings thru Q4 of 2014.
Revenue Hours
Revenue hours of service provided on Access-a-Ride increased by 3% during the 4th quarter of 2014 as
compared to the same period of 2013. Access-a-Ride is approximately 4% under budgeted revenue
hours through the fourth quarter of 2014.
On-Time Performance
Carrier on-time performance through the 4th quarter of 2014 was 94.9% and decreased slightly as
compared to the same period in 2013. Our private contractors continue to address on-time performance
challenges. Several of the carriers are utilizing the radio and billboards as a means of attracting potential
operators.
Passenger on-time performance through the 4th quarter of 2014 was 83.9% and remained similar to the
same period in 2013 (83.7%).
Customer Complaints
Complaints per passenger increased slightly through the 4th quarter of 2014 as compared to the same
period in 2013 as complaints increased from .0009 complaints per passenger boarding to .0011
complaints per passenger boarding. Staff continues to work with our carriers and passengers to improve
overall customer satisfaction.

Call-n-Ride Comments:
Belmar CnR - This service was introduced in April 2013 with the opening of the West Corridor. One
of the 2 vehicles operated on a flex route during the peak hours and replaced parts of the Rtes 14
and 17 that had been discontinued or modified with the opening of the West Line. The flex route did
not pick up bus ridership as expected and was discontinued in August 2014, but the vehicle was
retained to serve on-request trips and Oak Station with timed meets. If ridership does not increase
by the August 2015 runboard, one bus will be recommended to be discontinued.
Evergreen CnR – A strong Call-n-Ride over the years, there are two major factors in the decline of
ridership: a school closed whose students rode CnR and the Extension program for the disabled
moved and acquired their own bus. We have met with the Seniors’ Resources Center (SRC) and
they have been actively working with the senior living communities and the schools to increase
ridership. We are planning a Transportation Advisory Committee (TAC) to be formed this spring.
CnR is the only RTD local service in the community.
Federal Heights – This was started in January 2012 with a CMAQ grant with the local share funded
by Federal Heights (no RTD funds). RTD recommended discontinuance of the CnR in January 2015;

however, the community and RTD agreed to keep the CnR for 1 year at a 50% cost share to each
party. In 2014 an advocate started teaching seniors how to use the CnR. This has worked and
ridership began rising in 2014. RTD will form a TAC to address Adams County CnRs in summer
2015.
Highlands Ranch - This opened with the Southeast Corridor in November 2006. Highlands Ranch
CnR replaced the poorly performing Rte 426 Ranch Rider. Over the years RTD has tried numerous
adjustments to the service area and marketing. It has been recommended to be discontinued twice.
Highlands Ranch has carried a high percentage of Access-a-Ride qualified users. While the subsidy is
high for the CnR, if CnR were to be discontinued, this ridership would move to Access-a-Ride where
the subsidy would be much higher. Douglas County has contributed financially to the CnR in the
past. In 2015 Douglas County and Highlands Ranch will cost share with the RTD for 50% of the
subsidy. A TAC was formed to reevaluate service and marketing to increase ridership.
Parker – This opened with the Southeast Corridor in November 2006. Over the years RTD has made
adjustments to the service area and marketing. It has been recommended to be discontinued
twice. In 2015 Douglas County and the Town of Parker will cost share with the RTD for 50% of the
subsidy. A TAC was formed to reevaluate service and marketing to increase ridership.

Contracted Fixed-Route Quarterly Report – 4th
Quarter 2014

Information

The following is a discussion of the performance measures for the fourth quarter of 2014 for the fixedroute services provided by private contractors:


PREVENTABLE VEHICLE ACCIDENTS PER 100,000 MILES
The contractors, individually and as a group, met the target of ≤ 2.0 Preventable Vehicle
Accidents per 100,000 miles in the 4th quarter. First Transit and Transdev (formerly known as
Veolia Transportation) continue to utilize bus operator monitoring technology and post-accident
investigations for retraining of operators. The contractors continue to emphasize safety with all
employees at monthly safety meetings, through periodic campaigns, and with daily reminders at
their facilities.



PASSENGER ACCIDENT RATIO PER 100,000 MILES
The contractors, individually and as a group, met the target of ≤ 0.18 Passenger Accidents per
100,000 miles in the 4th quarter. Three of the four passenger accidents that occurred in the 4th
quarter were classified as non-preventable. First Transit and Transdev continue to raise
awareness of passenger safety to reduce the number of passenger accidents per 100,000 miles.



ON-TIME PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE INSPECTIONS
The contractors, individually and as a group, met the target of 98% of Preventive Maintenance
Inspections completed as scheduled in the 4th quarter. RTD and the contractor organizations
place a high emphasis on completing preventive maintenance inspections as required, and as
such, the local operations are diligent about completing these inspections on time.



ON-TIME PERFORMANCE
The contractors as a group did not meet the target of 88% Local On-Time Service in the 4th
quarter. Transdev met this goal with 88.3% Local On-Time Service. First Transit Denver and
Longmont nearly met this goal with 87.1% and 87.9% Local On-Time Service. RTD and the
private contractors continue to campaign routes and operators with low on time performance
with a strong focus on first time point departures. On a monthly basis contractors review the
OTP report and meet with operators of low performing routes to discuss factors that are
impacting their ability to reach 88% on time performance.
The contractors will continue to address on-time performance issues with operators, but always
tie safety to the discussion. It’s better to be a few minutes late than to have an accident.



MILES BETWEEN LOST SERVICE ROAD CALLS
The contractors, individually and as a group, exceeded the target of 26,000 Miles Between Lost
Service Maintenance Road Calls in the 4th quarter. The contractors continue to improve in this
area by completing preventive maintenance inspections on time, working off defects in a timely

Packet Pg. 77

2.C.4

manner, monitoring repeat issues, providing additional training for mechanics, and taking a proactive approach to maintaining the buses in their fleets.


OPERATOR COMPLAINTS PER BOARDING
The contractors as a group met the target of .0004 Complaints per Boarding in the 4th quarter.
First Transit Commerce City and First Transit Longmont met the goal with .0004 and .0003
complaints per boarding in the 4th quarter. The contractors continue to investigate and address
customer complaints with operators. The contractors utilize onboard video surveillance to retrain
operators on the importance of good customer service and automatic vehicle location software to
improve on time performance. The contractors also continue to address complaint trends with all
operators at monthly safety meetings.

4th Quarter Customer Complaint Analysis

Recapped below is an analysis of the customer complaint trends for the 4th Quarter of 2014. Also
included is a comparison of customer complaint data for the same period in 2013.
As noted in previous reports, in 2007 and 2008, RTD and the private contractors were meeting the
performance goal for customer complaints of .0002 complaints per passenger boarding. In 2009, RTD
began stricter enforcement of the fare policy and the priority seating area policy which advised
passengers with strollers or other large items that they would need to move from the priority seating
area if those seats were needed for disabled passengers. In addition, RTD posted notices on all buses
and light rail vehicles advising passengers of the requirement under Title VI of the Civil Rights Law for
operators to call out transfer points. Following the implementation of these policies/procedures,
customer complaints increased, but for 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 RTD and the private contractors
performed, for the most part, at a level of .0003 to .0004 complaints per passenger boarding. In 2012,
the performance goal for passenger complaints was adjusted to .0003 complaints per passenger
boarding. The goal for 2014 was again adjusted to account for the static higher level of complaints due
to the securement area/priority seating issues, the fare enforcement campaigns, TIC availability,
introduction of SmartCards, and the new West Line service. The goal for 2014 is .0004 complaints per
passenger boarding.
For the 4th Quarter of 2014, RTD, First Transit Commerce City, and First Transit Longmont met the goal
of .0004 complaints per passenger boarding. First Transit Denver and Veolia had .0005 complaints per
passenger boarding. The combined performance for all of the private contractors was .0004 complaints
per passenger boarding. The combined performance for RTD and the private contractors was .0004
complaints per passenger boarding.
RTD staff, as well as the private contractors, monitor and address customer complaints on a daily basis.
RTD and the private contractors investigate all customer complaints using a variety of tools, including
CAD/AVL “flashbacks” and video review and address/discipline operators as needed. Many times the
results of the investigation reveal that the complaint is not valid. Some of the reasons for the “Not
Valid” classification include the following:
Bus was on time (between 1 min early to 5 min late) per “flashback”
Operator followed proper procedure
Passenger presented insufficient fare
Passenger had no proof of eligibility for a discounted fare
Passenger presented an expired transfer
Passenger presented a counterfeit pass
Buses were running late District-wide due to weather
There was no video evidence to support the complaint
RTD and the private contractors continue to work collectively in a variety of different areas to address
customer complaints.

Bus routes with poor on-time performance are monitored by both RTD and private contractor
personnel to determine if the problem is related to the operator or the running time of the route.
Meetings are held on a monthly basis with contractor and RTD personnel to discuss challenges,
solutions and best practices in the areas of bus maintenance, operations, safety and training.
Bus operator trainers from RTD and the private contractors meet weekly in an effort to ensure
consistency in training messages and practices and produce a quarterly newsletter which is
shared with operations personnel.
RTD is conducting refresher training for all operators on an annual basis, and a component of the
training is customer service. The private contractors conduct mandatory monthly safety meetings
wherein they discuss customer service issues and provide suggestions for improving passenger
interactions.
RTD and private contractor trainers spend time at Civic Center Station and Denver Union Station
the first week of each runboard to provide assistance to operators who may need some
refreshers on station procedures or have questions on their routes.
RTD has also reached out to the disability community (Colorado School of the Blind, Atlantis,
DRMAC Transit Accessibility Task Force) to get feedback on ways to improve RTD service for
disabled passengers.
Operators are recognized for the good customer service they provide. Divisions post
commendations on a bulletin board in the drivers’ room and some provide additional means of
recognition.

Historically, and in 2014, the following complaint categories generated the highest number of customer
complaints:
Bus Did Not Show
Bus Early
Bus Late
Careless Driving/Operator
Discourtesy/Operator
Improper Procedure by Operator
Passed Up Passenger at Stop
All of these complaint categories are what RTD considers “operator related” and are included in the
complaint numbers that are tracked and reported to the Board of Directors on the Quarterly Performance
Report.
The high complaint categories are routinely reviewed to determine the factors, both internal and
external, that are impacting the number of complaints. The input received from both RTD and private
contractor operations is noted below:
Bus Did Not Show – For 4th Quarter 2014, the complaints in this category decreased 25.7% compared
to the same period in 2013. In many cases, CAD/AVL “flashbacks” confirm that buses are on route, but
running late. However, from the passenger’s perspective, the bus did not show. The YTD average in
this category for 2014 is 4.8 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2013 was 6.4 complaints
per day.
Bus Early – For 4th Quarter 2014, complaints in this category decreased 22.6% compared to the same
period in 2013. “Flashbacks” for “bus early” complaints often show buses running late. It is possible
passengers see the prior bus running late and will assume it is their bus running early. Operators are
addressed whenever the CAD/AVL playback confirms that the bus was running ahead of schedule. The

Packet Pg. 81

2.C.5

YTD average in this category for 2014 is 5.1 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2013
was 6.6 complaints per day.
Bus Late – For 4th Quarter 2014, complaints in this category increased 3.4 % compared to the same
period in 2013. Improving on-time performance continues to be a challenge for a variety of reasons
including construction, traffic and heavy ridership delays; service reductions, which result in the same
number of passengers on fewer trips; and the inability to fund service improvements to address runningtime issues. The YTD average in this category for 2014 is 12.4 complaints per day. The comparable
number for 2013 was 12.0 complaints per day.
Careless Driving/Operator – For 4th Quarter 2014, complaints in this category increased 8.9% compared
to the same period in 2013. On a regular basis, video recordings are reviewed and undercover ride
checks are performed to determine if operators are driving in an unsafe or inappropriate manner. In
addition, the private contractors have “G-force activated” event-recording systems (Drive Cam, Smart
Drive) installed on the buses and RTD is in the process of installing a system on its buses. These
incidents are also reviewed on a daily basis. Operators continue to be counseled and retrained as
needed to improve driving performance. Also, periodic safety campaigns are conducted to reinforce safe
driving habits. The YTD average in this category is 4.6 complaints per day. The comparable number for
2013 was 4.2 complaints per day.
Discourtesy/Operator – For 4th Quarter 2014, complaints in this category increased 2.0% compared to
the same period in 2013. In the majority of cases, video evidence confirms that the operator followed
proper procedures and treated the customer with respect. In many cases, operators are shown
enforcing or explaining policies (requesting proper fare payment, requesting space in the priority seating
area, addressing inappropriate behavior) in a polite and respectful manner and the passengers react in a
negative manner. Operators are counseled and disciplined if video evidence confirms that they treated
passengers in a discourteous or inappropriate manner. Operators are also given suggestions for handling
similar situations in the future. The YTD average in this category for 2014 is 11.0 complaints per day.
The comparable number for 2013 was 10.8 complaints per day.
Discrimination – This category was created in 2009 to track complaints related to Title VI issues. For
4th Quarter 2014, complaints in this category decreased 34.1% compared to the same period in 2013.
Investigation into discrimination-related complaints usually shows the operator not at fault. The YTD
average in this category for 2014 is 0.3 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2013 was 0.5
complaints per day.
Fare Dispute – For 4th Quarter 2014, complaints in this category decreased 11.3% compared to the
same period in 2013. It appears passengers have come to accept the fact that operators are expecting
fares to be paid upon boarding. Investigations into “fare dispute” complaints often show that
passengers presented an improper/incomplete fare and are not happy with the operators’ enforcement of
the fare policies. The YTD average in this category for 2014 is 1.1 complaints per day. The comparable
number for 2013 was 1.3 complaints per day.
Improper Procedure/Operator – For 4th Quarter 2014, complaints in this category increased 9.2%
compared to the same period in 2013. RTD and private contractor training and operations personnel
meet on a regular basis to ensure all operators are receiving consistent and up-to-date information. In
addition, the on-going refresher training provided to RTD operators and the monthly safety meetings held
at the private contractor divisions provide operators with information about accommodating the needs of
RTD passengers to the best of their abilities. In cases where video evidence shows operators are not

Packet Pg. 82

2.C.5

following proper procedures, appropriate action is taken. The YTD average in this category for 2014 is
8.0 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2013 was 7.3 complaints per day.
Incorrect Info/Operator – For 4th Quarter 2014, complaints in this category decreased 11.3% compared
to the same period in 2013. The combined efforts of the General Superintendent of Transportation, the
Bus Operator Training Newsletter Team, Street Supervisors and Dispatchers are providing operators with
up-to-date information to answer customer questions and address customer concerns. The YTD average
in the category for 2014 is 0.4 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2013 was also 0.5
complaints per day.
Passed Up Passenger At Stop – For 4th Quarter 2014, complaints in this category increased 8.1%
compared to the same period in 2013. In many cases, “flashbacks” for these complaints will confirm
buses are on route and either on time or running late. It is possible the passenger was not directly at the
stop when the bus arrived. Many complaint comments indicate the passenger was running to the stop
as the bus passed. Operators are reminded to stay vigilant and watch for passengers that may not be
waiting directly at the bus stop. In addition, operators are directed to contact RTD Dispatch whenever a
passenger is passed up due to the bus being full. The number of “Pass Up” complaints from passengers
with disabilities and/or those using mobility aids represents a small number of the total “Pass Up”
complaints (156 of the total 3,999 = 3.9%). Information regarding overcrowded routes is forwarded to
the Service Planning & Scheduling Department for review and adjustment as needed and as resources
will allow. The YTD average in this category for 2014 is 11.0 complaints per day. The comparable
number for 2013 was 10.1 complaints per day.

Customer Satisfaction Survey
Although customer complaints help identify those areas in which RTD and the private contractors can
continue to improve the quality of service provided, the results of the 2011 Customer Satisfaction
Survey indicate that the majority of RTD passengers are satisfied with RTD services. On a scale of 1
(poor) to 5 (excellent), over 80% of bus, light rail, Call-n-Ride, and SkyRide passengers rated RTD either
a 4 or a 5.
Specific driver related areas that received ratings of 4.0 or higher were as follows:
Courtesy of bus driver
Driving skills
Drivers’ knowledge of their specific route
Drivers’ ability to answer your questions about bus service
Drivers announcing transfer stops

4th Quarter 2014 Security Statistics & Fare
Inspection Summary

Information

Fare Enforcement Statistics
Fare inspectors, security officers, street supervisors, and police officers, conduct fare inspection onboard buses and light rail vehicles. RTD’s policy is to provide a warning to first time offenders and then
to issue a citation if that person is contacted a second time without fare. The table below shows the
actual number of patrons without fare that resulted in warnings or citations. The variation in numbers
from month to month may be due to several factors: special events or other security security-related
incidents.

These tables lists the number of patron boardings observed, no fare or partial fares, the estimated fare
evasion rate, the number of warnings and citations issued, and the number of arrests made by police
officers. Arrests include citations issued or physical arrests made for criminal violations other than fare
evasion. This is an additional advantage to the plain clothes police fare inspection program as peace
officers have the authority to check for warrants and take the appropriate law enforcement action. This
quarter the bus routes inspected include the 15, 16, 31 & 0.

The below chart shows the plain clothes police fare enforcement observations for light rail. There is a
slightly higher fare evasion rate observed by the plain clothes program than for the rail station sweeps
and bus enforcement because of the following factors:
 Fare station sweeps are conducted by uniformed security officers; these officers require all
patrons to have fare before boarding vehicles
 Rail operators do not have any interface with patrons, while bus operators do ask for fare
 Plain clothes police officers do not have a deterrence factor as uniformed officers, thus they
inherently find more violations of fare evasion.
