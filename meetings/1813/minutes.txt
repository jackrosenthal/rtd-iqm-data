I. Updates
a. Boulder Transit Village – Bill Sirois, Manager, Transit Oriented Development,
gave an update on the Boulder Transit Village. Staff will release a RFP in the
near future for design and construction for a bus facility at the site. The site
is at 30th and Pearl in Boulder. Boulder is going through an area plan process
that is expected to be adopted in July 2007. The bus transfer station is a
facility that has a CMAQ grant through DRCOG for $11.5 million. The District
is in negotiation with Boulder on an Inter-Governmental Agreement (IGA) and
scope of work. Design should be complete by the end of 2008 with
construction to follow. The bus facility will also relocate the former Foothills
park-n-Ride.
Director Chacon expressed her concern that affordable housing be included in
the Transit Village plan. Bill Sirois said that there are units set aside for this.
b. Boulder FLO Study – Errol Stevens gave this update. The District is working
with the City of Boulder on a FasTracks Local Optimization Study (FLO). An

IGA is ready to be executed for $115,000 to look at the redesign of the
Boulder Transit Center and concept for design of the Broadway/Euclid site.
Director Ruchman asked if the District is doing a FLO with every municipality
involved in FasTracks. Bill Van Meter, Senior Manager of Systems Planning,
said that the District does do this with the other municipalities but it doesn’t
have a formal name. The District works with local governments, officials and
the public. This type of work is part of the FastConnects portion of
FasTracks.
II. Recommended Actions
On-Call Engineering & Design Services Contract, June 2007 through June 2012
– Liz Rao, Assistant General Manager, Planning and Development, introduced this
item. This is an on-call contract for engineering services to design projects in the
TDP. Stan Szabelak, Engineering Project Manager, said that the District uses this
contract to provide expertise that the District does not have in house.
Ten firms submitted proposals and staff is recommending Huitt-Zollar for award of
the contract. There is a 10% DBE goal for any Federal work and a 15% SBE goal
for any local work.
Cory Granrud, park-n-Ride Design Manager, passed out a list of possible project
candidates for out-sourced design services. A copy of this list is available in the
Planning and Development Meeting Minute Notebook.
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all
documents necessary to award a contract to the most qualified proposer, HuittZollar, Inc. in the estimated no-to-exceed amount of $5,000,000 for the On-Call
Engineering & Design Services contract. This contract has a five-year duration
and is administered on an as-needed, work order basis. This contract is based on
our projected TDP budgeted projects that will require subsequent RTD Board
action.
There was considerable discussion regarding this action item. Several directors
raised concerns about this contract. Director Chacon asked what kinds of things
are beyond staff’s expertise. Stan Szabelak said that staff is very busy with
FasTracks. John Shonsey, Senior Manager, Engineering, replied that there are
many different areas that are covered by this contract that we do not have in
house; land surveyors, geo-technical, etc. Director Chacon wondered why staff
couldn’t be hired to meet these criteria rather than awarding a contract. Liz Rao
responded that the projects are very diverse and that the District may not need
these services full time but only for a few months or a half a year.
Director Ruchman had concerns about billing rates for the consultants versus
hiring as a staffer. John Shonsey said that not only does the District get the
staff, they provide trucks, labs, equipment, etc.

Director Ruchman spoke about his desire to see more alternatives than just
accepting the contract or not accepting the contract.
Director Martinez said that the Board is very concerned about finances and needs
to understand the reason behind these contracts.
Liz Rao said that these projects require a level of expertise and technical work
that the District does not have in house. It is not cost effective to have these
services in house due to sophisticated equipment and work that the District does
not need on a regular basis. Expanding staff would require additional supervision
staff, additional office space, and purchasing expensive equipment.
Stan Szabelak stated that the consultant gives the District flexibility to complete a
larger number of projects.
Motion: Director McMullen made a
motion to forward this item to
the full Board at the May 15,
2007 Board Meeting.
Second: Director Elfenbein seconded
the motion.
Vote on
Motion: The motion passed on a 4-1
vote (Director Ruchman voted
against).

(Contract #36DH003) – Liz Rao spoke to this action item.

documents necessary to award a contract amendment to initiate the second year
of a three-year option contract for the annual Street Improvements & Shelter
Installation contract with Manion Construction, Inc. for $359,158.00. Funding
for this contract amendment is provided by the annual 2007 Capital Budget.
Motion: Director McMullen made a

the full Board at the May 15,

US 36 Draft Environmental Impact Statement – Gina McAfee gave a presentation
regarding the US 36 Draft Environmental Impact Statement. Copies of this
presentation are available for viewing in the Planning and Development Committee
Meeting Minutes Notebook.
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of
Directors direct the General Manager to release the US 36 Draft Environmental
Impact Statement for public and agency review. This is the first of a series of
steps in the National Environmental Policy Act process and means simply that the
agencies are requesting official public and agency comment and feedback on the
No Action and the two build alternatives and their impacts.

motion to forward this item to
the full Board at the May 15,
2007 Board Meeting.
