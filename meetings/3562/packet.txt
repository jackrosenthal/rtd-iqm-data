BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Proposed 2023-2024 Internal Audit Plan

May 9, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
May 23, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the 2023-2024 Internal Audit Plan.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Audit Committee Charter was approved by the Board on October 25, 2022, which requires the
Audit Committee, consistent with the Internal Audit Function Charter and subject to Board approval, to:
•

Recommend approval of the risk-based annual audit plan and all major changes to the plan

The annual audit plan directs the activities of the internal audit function performed by RubinBrown, LLP
for RTD. Each internal audit project is developed based on the annual enterprise risk assessment with the
intent to perform audits which provide the greatest impact to RTD’s ability to achieve its strategic plan
and goals. The annual audit plan may be modified at any time by the Chief Audit Executive to adjust for
changing circumstances and new information. Any proposed significant deviation from the approved
internal audit plan must be communicated in advance to Executive Leadership and the Audit Committee
and approved by the Board. Internal audit results will be communicated to the Audit Committee at least
quarterly. Audit Committee activities will be reported to the Board at each Board meeting.
DISCUSSION
The Proposed 2023-2024 Internal Audit Plan recommends audits to be undertaken through the end of
2024. Each proposed audit has been selected in response to the results of the enterprise risk
assessment which was most recently updated to include input from Executive Leadership, the Audit
Committee, and the Board in early 2023, and presented to the Audit Committee on April 6, 2023. In
addition, each proposed audit has an estimate of the number of hours necessary to complete the audit.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The contract for internal audit services with RubinBrown was approved by the Board on June 28, 2022,
for three years plus two option years with a not-to-exceed value over five years of $3,212,105. The
financial impact has been included in the 2023 Budget.
