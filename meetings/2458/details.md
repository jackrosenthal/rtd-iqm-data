### B. Recommended Actions

There were no recommended actions.

#### 1. Bus rapid Transit (BRT) Planning Efforts Status

Chris Quinn, Planning Project Manager, stated over the last several years there have been a few activities that led staff in the direction of considering Bus Rapid Transit (BRT).  These included the Northeast Area Transit Study II (NATE) that provided a potential BRT corridor between Brighton and Denver, the Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS) that provided a potential framework for arterial BRT, other entities’ efforts creating additional BRT opportunities, the successful opening of the Flatiron Flyer and the state legislation permitting bus-on-shoulder operations.   He reviewed the Power Point presentation that was included in the April 5, 2016 Planning and Development Committee Agenda Packet.

Chris Quinn shared that the Northeast Area Transit Study II (NATE II) purpose included the analysis of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) alternatives between Denver/Brighton corridors.  The final report recommends further consideration of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) on the State Highway 2 (SH 2) corridor.  The line would terminate along the University of Colorado A Line at:

- Colorado Blvd. Station or

- Central Park Station

He noted other activities being addressed are looking at the possibility of transitioning from Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) to rail on this route in the future.  Staff is still working towards completing a final report to present to the Board.  Chris Quinn stated that the SH119 was the stakeholders’ recommendation as the highest priority after the Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS). He said staff is developing the scope of work for environmental clearance and preliminary engineering.  He anticipates releasing a request for proposal (RFP) in late spring.  Chris Quinn expects this study process to take approximately 2 to 2 ½ years.

Other feasibility analysis studies being reviewed are:

- SH 7 Corridor – Coalition led by Boulder County for corridor from Boulder to Brighton.

- US 287 – Interest from coalition of Northwest-area stakeholders in advancing this corridor forward from Longmont to US 36.

- East Colfax – Denver/Aurora pursuing bus enhancements from downtown to I-225.

- Speer/Leetsdale Corridor – Denver beginning bus enhancement study/environmental review for corridor.

- I-25 North – Colorado Department of Transport CDOT to begin bus-on-shoulder study to address “reverse commute” on Downtown Express managed lanes.

- US 36 to 120th Ave. – Colorado Department of Transport CDOT to open managed lanes extension.   Next phase will extend from 120th to C-470.

Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) awarded RTD $1 million in transit improvement program (TIP) grant funding for a region-wide BRT study. This study will provide high-level analysis of potential corridors which could benefit from BRT – type capital investments.  Chris Quinn stated that this study will also provide a prioritized list of candidate corridors for future RTD investments.  The high level analysis study is due to commence mid-2017.

Director Bagley wondered if further study and the TIP grant would look at providing BRT throughout entire metro area of Denver such as Wadsworth, Colorado Boulevard, Arapahoe Road, etc.  Chris Quinn replied that staff would like to look at all principle corridors in the region to determine what routes could benefit most from small capital improvement for travel time and ridership.

Director Lubow shared that she was very excited about the sound of this information, especially since the Flatiron Flyer is doing so well.  She added that she believes BRT has potential to be really positive in District I; however, she has to raise the concern from the north that even though BRT is a good idea they still do not have a rail option.  She noted Chris Quinn talked about studying how convertible BRT is to rail.  She wonders if BRT along SH 119 could be converted in the future.  Chris Quinn replied that one of the things his department found during the Northeast Area Transit Study II (NATE II) is they often heard people saying that an option is to start with  BRT and then convert it to rail.  In that corridor staff found a lot of feasibility challenges.  Chris Quinn believes it has been done in Ottawa Canada; however, given the corridors that RTD is looking at such as SH 119 there are many associated challenges with this conversion option.  Director Lubow further inquired if they would be addressing which corridors would be easily convertible to rail.

Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager of Planning, answered that this topic can be criteria his department will address as part of their evaluation.  He explained that dedicated corridors for BRT would lend themselves more easily to conversion.  Director Lubow requested that the conversion analysis specifically include the Northwest areas.

General Manager Genova explained that the conversion issues are really about Right-of-Way (ROW).  He referenced to the example addressed by Chris Quinn previously in Canada that the BRT was operating in its own designated ROW.  He stated that the conversion issue is fairly straight forward to assess in any corridor where RTD would consider BRT.

Director Sisk asked if his memory was correct that RTD paid $2.2 million for NAMS.  He wondered if RTD had completely scrapped the plan or if it was still viable.  Bill Van Meter replied that as was previously referenced to by Chris Quinn, the top priority determined from NAMS was completion of Northwest rail.  That remains a priority and has not changed for the agency.  The top BRT corridor was SH119. Staff is proceeding forward with support from Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) funds, as well as RTD funds, to do a National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) analysis and preliminary engineering.  He noted in the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) the Board adopted last year there was $15 million allocated as a first increment toward actual capital construction in last year of the SBP.  This is a real commitment made by the Board toward that top BRT priority.  Bill Van Meter pointed out another key recommendation was to address the reverse commute on North I-25 and bus on shoulder opportunities.  He is pleased and excited about Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) awarding themselves a grant to move forward on a study.  RTD will be assisting with local match for a study on reverse bus-on-shoulder operations for I-25 North.

Director Sisk noted that having been part of Northwest Area Mobility Study and having worked on a fairly integral basis, he believes it is important to keep NAMS moving forward.  The consensus was not exclusive to just the Northwest Rail but just a prong of what was agreed upon by stakeholders.   Director Sisk addressed that Bill Van Meter and Chris Quinn had answered the question in the way he had remembered so he was happy.

Director Sisk inquired if the Planning Department was working on any Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) grants in connection with bus-on-shoulder on North I-25.  Bill Van Meter responded that they were not for this year; however, staff would possibly look into it in 2017.  CDOT is not comfortable supporting it at this time.  CDOT wants a completed study so they have a better understanding of scope, cost and challenges for the N I-25 bus-on-shoulder.

Director Francone expressed that she would like to further add to Director Bagley’s comments.  Director Francone would like staff to consider things like the Jefferson County Parkway project, which is currently at ground level right now so she believes there is an opportunity to evaluate BRT.  Bill Van meter responded that there are a number of candidate corridors throughout the District that staff intend to look at and plan to involve stakeholders and DRCOG to help identify all the opportunities.

Director Solano stated that it was his understanding that SH 2 did not have shoulder width for BRT consideration. He wondered if that was true.  Chris Quinn responded that there is some reconstruction happening on the SH 2.  He said even though RTD is probably not getting exclusive lanes constructed, there is still opportunity for bus-on-shoulder, que jumps, etc.

Director Solano asked what timeframe RTD was looking at for implementation of NATE II.  Chris Quinn responded that a high level conceptual study was done.  RTD would need to do a NEPA, similar to what we are doing on SH 119.  That would be the next step to get closer to implementation.

Director Anderson believes the Board members would benefit from being open minded in regard to various transit issues and recognizing that most of them would not be resolved in any of their terms of office.  RTD is taking adequate first steps in beginning to look at these issues.  She noted RTD started major investment studies 25 years before even beginning FasTracks.  The transit solution may not look like how the Board sees it today.  Director Anderson would like to see all the communities working together utilizing the many technology and engineering advances that are developing.  Director Folska wondered if CDOT required any kind of legislative authority to provide public transit within the RTD district.  Bill Van Meter replied that he was not sure about the legal restrictions or opportunities but as they are operating Bustang today he believes they are allowed to operate transportation.

Director Folska believes CDOT is really trying to connect communities outside the District into RTD.   She asked Bill Van Meter to find out about CDOT’s authority to operate within the District. Director Folska asked what RTD’s commitment to the study on reverse I-25 commute.  She also wondered the total cost of the study.  Bill Van Meter stated that he would need to confirm the exact number but believes it is approximately $17,000 - $20,000, less than half of the local match.  The total cost is in the $300-350 hundred thousand range.

Director Folska stated that there is currently a lot of studies going on, many of which seem to be overlapping with the NAMS that cost RTD $2.2 million.  She questioned if staff found redundancy in all of these different studies.   Director Folska proposed that they instead incorporate the finding of NAMS and pull all the monies together to do one study.  Bill Van Meter replied that was exactly what staff has been thinking about.  Staff plans to take what was done in NAMS and apply it to the rest of the region to allow for a more efficient study.

Committee Chair James commented that he would like the Planning Department to think outside the box and that he has concerns that today’s solutions are sometimes the mode du jour.  He would like them to recall that many years ago in one of the first studies on Colfax was the street car study which has led RTD to the direction it is now.  He wonders to what degree staff is considering those kinds of alternatives in present studies.  Bill Van Meter stated that the developments in on demand transit have been part of a national discussion.  His department is internally looking at how RTD best maximizes RTD’s relationship with those providers.   He anticipates his department will look at corridors for BRT with highest ridership potential; however, what staff learns in terms of the impact of on demand transit and how it impacts our services is hard to understand right now.

General Manager Genova added that staff is having ongoing conversations about on demand transit.  Staff is currently working with Denver Metro Chamber, CDOT, and DRCOG on a project called mobility blue print to look beyond the normal kinds of options that we do today.  This group is in the process of putting together a Request for Information (RFI) to look to industry to see how we might be able to scope an effort around that.  He indicated staff is engaged in these kinds of planning efforts with other major stakeholders in the region.

Committee Chair James responded that this process will serve as context for BRT study.

##### a. Board BRT Update April 2016

#### 2. East Colfax Transit Improvements

Lacy Bell, Planning Project Manager, stated that last year she was not working on the East Colfax Transit improvements but was instead involved in the fare study.  Since she was newish to the project she wanted to get some background information on route 15 and 15L.  She was aware that this service has our highest ridership but was surprised to learn that it is higher than the W-Line as well as the Flatiron Flyer with an average of 22K per weekday.  She explained that there are two related projects occurring, the Colfax Corridor Connections led by the City and County of Denver, and the 15L Route Improvements led by RTD.  She reviewed a Power Point presentation that is available in the April 5, 2016 Planning and Development Committee Agenda Packet.

The activities that have occurred as part of the Colfax Corridor Connections Project are:

- In 2010 Denver completed the Colfax Streetcar Feasibility Study (CSFS).

- In 2011 Denver initiated a $3 million Alternatives Analysis (AA)/environmental documentation study:

o        $2 million of funding from Federal Transit Administration FTA

o        $1 million of funding provided by Denver

- In 2015 the Alternatives Analysis/environmental documentation study was completed with the preferred alternative selective being with Bus Rapid Transit (BRT)

- Anticipated completion of environmental documentation is in spring 2016.

- Next steps are to identify funding for implementation of engineering design and construction.

Lacy Bell noted that as a result of the Colfax Corridor Connections, BRT is being considered as a viable alternative.  The BRT would include:

- 5 minute peak period service and enhanced stops from Auraria to Anschutz

- Providing a peak period bus only lane from Broadway to Syracuse Street

She shared that the 15L Route Improvements Project goal is to implement improvements that will work for day and support future BRT enhancements.  The hope is to look at short-term opportunities to improve transit on East Colfax while working with the city toward the long-term goal of BRT.  The project limits are 25 stops between Broadway and I-25.   The total project budget is approximately $11 million with RTD contributing the local match for all grants at approximately $2 million total.  Lacy Bell explained that 15L Bus Stop Enhancement suggestions have included extensive public feedback.  The enhancements now include:

- Security cameras

- Improved lighting

- Enhanced shelters with better visibility

o        Include trash cans and benches

o        Modular with the ability to expand at high ridership stops

o        Enhancements will be incorporated into Bus Rapid Transport BRT stops

She stated 15L operational improvements include bus bulbs/curb extensions (sidewalk extended to edge of the parking lane so the bus stops in the travel lane), queue bypass lanes and transit signal priority (TSP).  The next current action items include environmental clearance and engineering design.  The next step is to develop the construction/implementation schedule based on design reviews.

Chair Tobiassen thanked Lacey Bell for the great presentation.  He is excited to see the upcoming improvements to Colfax.  Director Tobiassen asked if the security cameras that are being installed would have real time video recording capacity.  Lacy Bell replied that these security cameras would be like RTD’s other security cameras already installed.  She said this depends on if we can connect to fiber and if there are places we can mount.  Chair Tobiassen stated there is always a chance that other grants might be available for security improvements.

Chair Tobiassen further added that one of the problems the 15L has today is if one bus runs late, all the other buses do not pass and stay in sequence.  He wonders how staff envisions handling that kind of issue.  Lacy Bell replied that this kind of problem is difficult because it is such a popular route.  She explained that one of the reasons the buses cannot pass is there are passengers getting off at almost every stop.  She is hopeful these improvements, as well as a dedicated lane in the future, will improve operations.

Director Lubow stated how glad she is that people are working on the crowding issue on the 15 and 15L routes. Regarding 15L project budget Director Lubow asked Lacy Bell to confirm that RTD investment amount would be $2 million in total.  Lucy Bell replied that the 15L Project Budget total was $11 million and the RTD’s contribution would be $2 million.

Director Lubow asked if there would be greater operational cost or less associated with these improvements.  Lacy Bell indicated that due to this line being so popular the cost will more than likely remain the same; however, staff is hoping with improved operations and reliability of the 15L there might be a reduction in operation costs.

Director Walker stated that he was familiar with a lot of the 15L problems being raised in tonight’s meeting.  He shared on Broadway the bulb outs were constructed and it makes for such a nice environment and a more pleasant, walkable area.  He believes there are a lot of benefits for the community when all parties work together.  Director Walker asked if the security camera would be placed on RTDs shelters or elsewhere.  Lacy Bell explained that RTD security prefers that the cameras be placed elsewhere due to the bus shelters not allowing the cameras a wide enough view.  She stated that her department will work on this issue through the design process.

Director Walker wondered who would be responsible for maintenance at the stops.  Lacy Bell stated that maintenance details still needed to be worked out.  She hopes to have a good, collaborative discussion with the City of Denver because these changes will benefit all parties.  Director Walker noted that the Business Improvement District on Broadway takes care of some of the stops.  He thinks this looks great and is looking forward to it progressing.

Director Francone stated that, on behalf of her nieces and nephews that ride the 15L every day, she would like to thank staff for these upcoming operational improvements and bus stop enhancements.  Director Francone inquired if there is an anticipated completion date.  Lacy Bell explained that the grant funds are programmed for 2016-2019.  She said it depends on how quickly we can get through the design review as to when RTD will start and end construction.

Director Deadwyler thanked Lacy Bell for such a beautiful report. She wondered if there would be a dedicated lane for BRT and buses, and if so, would Colfax be widened.  Lacy Bell answered that for 15L improvements the plan is to work with what is there.  For the City’s project they have been very adamant that they are not in favor of solving congestion by widening streets.  Director Deadwyler asked if that meant Colfax would just be one lane for cars.  She expressed concern this would only create more congestion.  Lacy Bell replied that during peak period just one lane would be used for cars.  She explained that the City has gone out and done traffic analysis and gone out to communities.  The City has determined traffic impacts are not significant enough to be a concern.

Committee Chair James said it was interesting to see what is going on along Colfax and thanked Lacy Bell for the update.

##### a. East Colfax Transit Improvements Board Update April 5 2016

### D. Other Matters

Committee Chair James thanked General Manager Genova for being a speaker at The Road Ahead event.  He thinks this is a very useful event and encouraged everyone to attend next year.  He shared there was a particularly interesting conversation at the VIP luncheon looking at partnerships within metro area.

Director Walker advised that last night he attended the Denver City Council meeting voting to approve the I-25 station area master plan.  He said the number one concern brought up at that meeting, and throughout study process, was parking.  If there is a development proposal for property RTD owns, parking is something that we will have to be very mindful of.  Citizens have a big concern that the overflow parking will result in an increase of people parking in neighborhood streets.

Director James asked for an update about the parking analysis that is underway. General Manager Genova reminded the Board that last month Bill Sirois, Senior Manager of Transit Oriented Development and Planning Coordination, did briefing on that project.  Denver is very aware of RTD’s concerns about parking.  RTD and Denver are working together to resolve any concerns.  Bill Van Meter stated that staff plans to report back to board at the next committee meeting on the progress of the parking technical assessment to-date.

### F. Adjourn

Committee Chair James adjourned the meeting at 6:31 p.m.
