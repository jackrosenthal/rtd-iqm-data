BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: May 16, 2013

From:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

May 16, 2013

Board Meeting Date: May 21, 2013

Subject:

August 2013 Service Plan

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors approve
moving the proposed August 2013 Service Change as summarized below and described in Attachment A
on to public review and comment.
DISCUSSION
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. For this year we will continue adjusting
services in response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a
whole while also focusing attention on the recent implementation of the West Corridor Light Rail Service
and the associated bus service changes. Routine service changes not associated with or included in the
West Corridor Service Plan are necessary to maintain system on-time performance and provide the
appropriate level of service according to customer demand while we will also need to monitor customer
response to the implementation of West Corridor bus and rail service and propose adjustments as
appropriate.
The proposed August 2013 Service Changes reflect the continued budgetary challenges faced by RTD.
The guiding principles for service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
 Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to enhance
service when possible;
 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
 Response to changes in the communities where services are provided

Attachment A
May 15, 2013
Route 6 – East 6th Ave/North Pecos
Extend 8:00am weekday westbound trip from 8th/Colorado to instead originate at Centrepoint &
Sable Transfer Center at 7:21am. Relieves overloads on the following trip at 7:36am from
Centrepoint & Sable. The cost is estimated to a be $10,300 annualized
Route 9 – West Tenth Avenue
School trippers would be discontinued due to parallel Light Rail service. (Offset against part of
cost of Route 100W trippers added.)

Route 12 – Downing/N Washington
Add 3:20pm northbound trip from Downing/Colfax to 106th/Melody, relieving overloads on the
following trip. Cost impact estimated at $8,300 annualized.
Route 14 – West Florida
It is proposed to extend the weekday trip that (in April) starts at Wadsworth/West Arkansas at
6:39 a.m. to instead begin service at Lakewood Commons at 6:24 a.m. Estimated cost are
projected to be $2,600 annualized
Route 16 – West Colfax
Peak and midday overloads are occurring at a level which clearly exceeds RTD service
standards. These overloads occur on a regular basis on the link between Decatur-Federal
Station and the Civic Center. This segment carries a heavy burden of social services and court
traffic throughout the day, with space needed for disabled customers and strollers or walkers.
West between Decatur-Federal Station and Wadsworth, peak period overloads are occurring,
but more data is needed in order to place extra trips.
RTD will add shuttle trips as soon as possible (June 9, 2013) to lead every Route 16 trip
between Decatur-Federal and the 10th/Broadway route terminal on weekdays between the
hours of 6:15 a.m. and 6:30 p.m. This will not only add back capacity, but also improve W-Line
connections for Civic Center with matching headways, making the use of Light Rail more
practical for trips west of Federal.
Proposed for August runboard:
It is proposed to extend peak period extra service to the Zephyr Street terminal (Wadsworth
Blvd.) and to extend one additional AM trip from Golden to Oak Station and one additional PM
trip from Oak Station to Golden. Projected cost impacts for this proposal total $840,000 and 8
peak buses, including requirements for the Golden trip extensions.
Route 17 – Red Rocks College
With the extension to Indiana Street, the span of service that was appropriate for college hours
begins too late for most commuting purposes. It is proposed to add a round-trip from Federal
Center Station to Indiana Street on weekdays at 5:37 a.m. Estimated weekday cost $5,200
annualized weekday

No cost anticipated

1.B.1.a

Attachment A
May 15, 2013
Route 21 – Evans Avenue
Add 7:21am westbound trip from Centrepoint & Sable to Evans Station. Relieves overloads on
both the 7:06am and 7:36am westbound trips. Weekday cost impact estimated at $15,500
Route 46 – Cherry Creek/Dahlia/DTC
Running time analysis and schedule adjustments.
No cost impacts anticipated

Route 87X
The former Route 87 Express had three trips into CCS in the morning peak and three trips out
from CCS in the afternoon peak. It averaged 128 boardings. The portion of the route west of
Wadsworth near Hampden was replaced by Route 30Ltd, which has twice as long a span of
service and a one-seat ride to the center of Downtown, as well as good transfer connections to
the Union Station and Civic Center. Although slower than Route 87X, that portion of the change
has received little criticism.
It is proposed to restore the route on its former alignment, with the exception of the segment
south of Yale Avenue, which was replaced by Route 30Ltd. That portion would be replaced by
running on Wadsworth to and from the Wadsworth & Hampden Park-n-Ride.
Requirements for restoring the route, based on the August 2012 Service Recap with interlines,
rounded up to 2 peak buses and $82,800 annualized.
Route 100 – Kipling Crosstown
A deviation from the current route on Quail Street is proposed to bring service closer to the new
Jefferson County Public Health location at 645 Parfet Street. Both northbound and southbound
buses would loop from Quail & Eighth via West Eighth Avenue, Parfet Street, West Sixth
Avenue Access Road and Quail Street. A minor adjustment would be made in the Route 100W
– North Kipling school tripper service to mesh with this change. No cost impacts are anticipated.
Route 100X – South Kipling Express
The former Route 100X had four trips into Civic Center Station (CCS) in the morning peak and
five trips out from CCS in the afternoon peak. It averaged 191 boardings. Its service pattern
was replicated by the Route 100Ltd at all of the neighborhood walk-on stops made by Route
100X, as well as at the Ken Caryl Park-n-Ride. Route 100Ltd is heavily interlined and would
require time changes for conversion to Route 100X.
In order to maintain connectivity for non-Civic Center Station bound riders, it is proposed to recreate Route 100X via the Route 100Ltd alignment between Ken Caryl Park-n-Ride and Federal
Center Station, and via the Regional routes alignment between Federal Center Station and Civic
Center, with a short dwell at Federal Center Station (FCS). Minor schedule adjustments would
be made. The fifth (final) trip in the evening would operate between FCS and Ken Caryl and the
reverse peak trips would also operate only between FCS and Ken Caryl and return.

Route 76 – Wadsworth Crosstown
Route 225 – Boulder/Broomfield via Baseline
Cut weekday routing of the Route 76 back from Lafayette to US 36 & Broomfield PnR. Replace
current Route 76 service with Route 225 extension from Broomfield to Lafayette PnR. Extend
Route 225 to US 36 & Broomfield PnR from Lafayette PnR, hourly headway, weekday only, to
replace current Route 76 segment. No cost impacts are anticipated.

1.B.1.a

Attachment A
May 15, 2013
Requirements for revising the route, incremental to the current costs for Route 100Ltd and for
special service that is replacing Route KC, are estimated at 1 peak bus and 6 weekday hours.
Gate assignments would be adjusted at Federal Center Station. The newly implemented Route
CS – Civic Center Station to Federal Center Station short turns trips would be reduced where
replaced by Route 100X. Annualized weekday cost estimated to be $76,400

Route 120X – Thornton/Wagon Road Express
It is proposed to add a SB AM trip from Thornton Park-n-Ride at about 8:40am, to alleviate the
consistent 20+ passenger overloads on the current 8:45am SB trip. Weekday cost impact
estimated to be $12,700.
Route 121 – Peoria Street
Reduce peak frequency between Nine Mile Station and Ulster/Tufts from every 15 to every 30
minutes. Ridership on peak direction trips averages between 2 and 3 passengers/trip. Savings
= 5.0 hours.
Add 1:37pm and 2:07pm northbound trips from Nine Mile, and 1:45pm southbound trip from
Montbello, to relieve standing loads on current 30 minute midday frequency. Cost: 3.7 hours
weekday.
Anticipated weekday savings estimated to be $13,400 annualized
Route 130 – Yale/Buckley
Modify service through Heather Gardens as follows:
Weekdays southbound, service will operate via Yale and Peoria to Nine Mile Station during the
AM peak and evenings after 7:00pm. Service will operate via Heather Gardens midday and PM
peak.
Weekdays northbound, service will operate via Heather Gardens during the AM peak and
midday, and via Peoria and Yale during the PM peak and evenings.
All Saturday, Sunday, and holiday service will operate via Yale and Peoria.
No cost impact anticipated.
Route 131 – Iliff
Reroute off of Vaughn Way between Iliff and Yale, use Abilene instead. Eliminates
neighborhood impact on Vaughn Way, will better serve future Iliff LRT Station.
No cost impact anticipated.
Route 133 – Hampden/Tower
Add 4:41am southbound trip from Centrepoint/Sable (feeds H-Line train at 5:23am), and add
4:55am and 5:25am northbound trips from Nine Mile (this productive route – 35 boardings/hour does not start northbound service until nearly 6:00am currently).
Weekday cost impacts estimated to be $23,800 annualized.
Route 153 – Chambers Road
Extend northbound evening service one hour later to 11:42pm from Arapahoe Crossing.
Cost impacts estimated to be $14,500 annualized.

Route 116X – South Simms Express
The reinstated Route 116X would be maintained as restored; with further modification
anticipated in January 2014, when Route 116Ltd and the Green Mountain call-n-Ride service
can be analyzed. The cost of reinstating this service is estimated at $76,400 annualized.

1.B.1.a

Attachment A
May 15, 2013
Route 204 – Table Mesa/Moorhead/North 19th
Running time adjustment; remove Vassar loop. No additional cost impact anticipated
Route 209 – CU/Table Mesa PnR
Re-route back through CU campus, via clockwise routing along Regent and Colorado to
alleviate overloads occurring on Route Stampede; move south-end layover to Manhattan Circle,
due to City of Boulder installation of a traffic signal at South Boulder Road. Remove the ‘Adams
Circle’ loop and service to Golden West from the route. Golden West is served by VIA, special
services.
No cost impact anticipated

Route 228 –Louisville/Broomfield
Discontinue first Sunday morning southbound morning trip and add a Saturday southbound PM
trip from Flatiron Mall to US 36 & Broomfield Park-n-Ride. No cost impact anticipated.
Route 323 – Skyline Crosstown
Reroute north-end layover/recovery location to Pace/17th SB, FS and remove current
Deerwood loop, due to constituent complaints received; create deadhead for NB to SB northend turn-around via Pace, Olympia, Pace routing. In addition, due to a request by the City of
Longmont, it is proposed to add an AM school tripper on this route by using the current BOLT
block 27 pull-out. Weekday annualized cost estimated to be $5,300
Routes CV/CS/CX – Pine Junction/Conifer/Denver
It is expected that the new Pine Junction Park-n-Ride will be opened during this Fall. Minor
schedule adjustments will be made in preparation for this change. Weekday cost impact
estimated to be $5,900 annualized.
Route DASH – Boulder/Lafayette via Louisville
The city of Boulder is installing a traffic signal at South Boulder Road and Manhattan Circle
which will allow RTD to move the layover/recovery for Route Dash short-turn trips back to the
former location. It is therefore proposed to change the current layover from Table Mesa PnR
back to Manhattan Circle, for the DASH short-turn trips.
No cost impact anticipated
Route JUMP – Boulder/Lafayette via Arapahoe
It is proposed to remove the excess layover at Erie Community Center in the mid-day and
balance the current trips at Lafayette PnR, WB to ½ hour frequency; will result in some mid-day
schedule adjustments. No resource impact anticipated.
Route KC – Ken Caryl/FC/Denver
This service has been cancelled in favor of operating reinstated service on the Route 116X –
South Simms Express. The annualized savings of $70,300 would be used to operate the 6
weekday trips (3 in each peak period) on the Route 116X.
Route SKIP – Broadway
It is proposed to add one school tripper in the PM from Fairview High School to
Broadway/Walnut at 3:29pm (or as warranted by the BVSD bell-times) due to overloads on the
current 3:25pm trip. Additionally it is proposed that schedule adjustments be made to the

W-Line Call-n-Rides: Belmar, Golden and Green Mountain:
With the opening of the West Line Light Rail, three new Call-n-Rides began operations on April
27, 2013. As with all new services, actual operations may require adjustments after a few
months in operation. Adjustments will be made based on customer travel patterns and
customer requests. There should be no additional costs associated with these modifications
except for the Golden Call-n-Ride. Annual weekday cost: $8,025.

Stroller Policy

Information

RTD’s current stroller policy is (with the exception of intercity/Regional buses) that baby carriages and
strollers may be used for transporting children on a space available basis. Passengers with strollers may
sit in a priority seating or securement area, but they may have to collapse their stroller and move to the
rear of the bus if those seats are needed for those with disabilities.
All operators (including contractors) are trained to enforce this policy by informing a passenger with a
stroller, at the time the passenger boards, that if a passenger with a mobility device or a disabled
passenger boards the bus they may need to collapse their stroller and move to the rear of the bus. The
operator should point to the stickers on the inside of the bus in the securement area to assist them with
RTD’s policy. Passengers are expected to comply with the operator’s request to move, however, if they
refuse no additional request is made.
We have been working internally with marketing, legal, EEO, operations, transportation and the DRMAC
(Denver Regional Mobility Accessibility Council – a group of individuals representing various
organizations for people with disabilities) to address this problem. I propose we take action by educating
passengers, operators and their support groups of how this policy will be enforced.
Passenger Education
Exterior Signage - A new sign will be posted near the entrance on the exterior of the coach stating “Be
prepared to collapse stroller” (English and Spanish). It will be accompanied with a symbol for strollers.

Interior Signage - Revised signs will be placed on the interior of the coach near the priority/securement
area stating, “As mandated by federal law, this area is designated for passengers with disabilities or
users of mobility devices. When asked, move from this area
(49 CFR Part 37).”
Campaign Kickoff (Passengers) - Marketing is finalizing the “Share the Ride” pamphlet; one side is
English and the other is Spanish. Street Supervision, Dispatch, and RTD Security will assist with
distribution of the pamphlet and future public education. Below is an excerpt from the pamphlet:
We all want to get to our destination in a safe and timely manner. Together we can
accomplish this mission! As mandated by federal law, the priority seating area is
designated for securement of mobility devices. When asked, move from this area in order
to accommodate a passenger with a mobility device. Please comply with requests to
move, and feel free to accept suggestions or ask for help from the operator.

Packet Pg. 15

1.C.1

Social Media - Marketing will post our current stroller policy on Facebook, Twitter and on the home page
of RTD's website.
Operator Education
Stroller policy - Operations will issue Bulletin reminders highlighting the policy as outlined in the current
Trailblazer and review with the operators as they attend the annual Refresher Training classes that the
primary purpose of the policy is to remind customers with strollers that even if they sit in a priority
seating or securement area, they may have to collapse the stroller and move to the rear of the bus if
those seats are needed for those with disabilities.
 Operators will be encouraged to ask passengers to fold up their strollers on routes where the
operator knows that the bus is going to get full. Such routes should be designated ahead of
time, if at all possible, to avoid the perceptions of favoritism.
 We will train and require operators to get out of their seats, stand in front of the people sitting in
the priority seating area and look them in the eye when they ask them to move. That should add
some additional pressure.
Campaign Kickoff (Operators) – Division Supervisors, Street Supervisors, Dispatch and RTD Security will
mentor and offer customer service tips on how to use simple verbiage to encourage cooperation from
passengers when they are asked to move.
Operator’s Information Page and Bulletin Board – Administrators will post reminders on the home pages
and add links to the campaign tools and Division Newsletters.
Instructors’ Forum – The Operation Training Departments of RTD and Contracted services meet weekly
for a newsletter committee meeting. This collaborative newsletter is full of helpful reminders and a great
way to communicate with the operators and support groups.
Score Board – “Share the RIDE” will be promoted on monitors at each division.
Support Groups
Operator -Dispatch/Street Supervision will ensure that the operator is supported when faced with a
passenger who refuses to move from the priority seating area. When unable to accommodate
passengers in mobility devices, operators are required to follow these steps:
 Contact dispatch using the pre-programmed data message ADA PAX Pass-up on the AMDT/CAD
AVL. This high priority message should result in a swift call back from the dispatcher.
 Dispatch will tell you how that passenger will be accommodated.
 Offer the passenger a courtesy transfer.
 Dispatch may request that a Street Supervisor meet at the location.
Passenger - Telephone Information Center will ensure that the passengers are supported by
addressing complaints of operators not complying with the policy.
I do anticipate a rise in customer complaints coming from passengers simply not happy with the
operators’ renewed enforcement of the policy. However, given that passengers with disabilities have
fewer seating options, enforcing this policy is critical to creating accessible transportation.

Smart Card Project Status Update

Information

INTRODUCTION
The Smart Card Program is successfully gathering taps for EcoPass and CollegePass riders. During the
month of April over 13M taps were recorded. The Smart Card Customer Service Center, (Operated
under an RTD contract with Xerox by Celina, Inc.) continues to distribute new cards upon request, issue
replacement cards and answer riders’ questions as they arise.
All bus installations are completed. Performance issues were identified on about 5% of the fleet and
mitigation work is complete and operating properly. RTD staff and Xerox have updated onboard
software on those vehicles to resolve the issues.
All one-hundred-nine Light Rail validators have been installed and are operational, with standard
maintenance activities under way. During meetings with Denver Downtown Partnership agreements
were reached to install two additional validators at 16th/California and 18th/California. The RTD
Network and Light Rail Teams completed connecting the validators to the existing network for the Ticket
Vending Machines (TVM). Validators for West Corridor were installed in coordination with the
installation of the TVMs. A Request for Proposal (RFP) has been published to retain a work order
contractor to provide on-call installation electrical services for additional validators as needed.
The Fare Inspector software used to confirm that passengers have tapped prior to boarding is
functioning sporadically and requires adjustments that are currently being addressed by Xerox. Xerox
has suggested solutions to the issues and they are working to have them implemented by July 31,
2013; RTD is encouraging Xerox to implement the solutions sooner. Fare Inspectors continue to operate
in an “educate & inform” mode and will transition to enforcement of the smart card tapping in the near
future.
300 Retail Point of Sales (RPOS) Terminals were delivered to RTD on May 10, 2013; Xerox met the
deadline for delivery of the RPOS units. Efforts continue to complete the Retailer’s Contract for Legal
review. RTD Marketing staff plan to meet with Safeway and King Soopers after a contract is signed to
develop the appropriate marketing campaign. In addition to the web portal already in place,
approximately 150 locations will be established throughout the region for riders to purchase monthly
passes and/or add value to their cards. Planning for Phase 2 of the program is in full-swing and the
schedule continues to be evaluated to ensure adequate timing for a successful Phase 2 launch.
The new Program Manager (Judy McMurphy) continues to work closely with the interim Program
Manager (Beverly Scott) assigned for subsequent Smart Card Initiatives. The pragmatic management
transition will continue over the next several months.

Status Update

Information

INTRODUCTION
Several significant problems with the CAD/AVL central system were occurring on Friday, May 10, 2013.
The combination of problems was so severe that we halted bus installations. INIT has made several
attempts to resolve the issues with limited success. Some issues are resolved, but the system is not
operating well enough to resume bus installations. Below is a capsulated summary that is followed by a
list of current and upcoming activities.

Status
On Friday, May 10, 2013, problems with the central
CAD/AVL system were severe enough that we halted bus
installations. INIT is working to resolve issues. Installations
will resume when the major problems are resolved to an
acceptable level.
Over 770 buses were installed at the time this report was
prepared. Projections indicate an August completion date.
ASA testing is ongoing and expected to continue through
June. Depending upon the results of the testing and
modifications required, testing could extend into July.
Asset management interfaces are going through detailed
testing that will extend into June.
A downstream data management interface with Ride Check
Plus is being developed.
Implementation for buses is anticipated for 2014 – 2015.
Implementation for trains is expected in 2015 – 2016.
