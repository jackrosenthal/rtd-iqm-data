### B. Recommended Actions

No recommended action was presented.

#### 1. FasTracks Quality Management

Kevin Diviness, Director of Quality Assurance, reviewed the Quality Management Update presentation included in the FasTracks Monitoring Committee agenda packet for June 2, 2015.  The presentation included the Quality Management System components, contractor requirements, focus on process and product, performance matrix, RTD Oversight Summary, explanation of the ISO 9001 Certification, Rocky Mountain Performance Excellence Recognition, and an overview of the Quality Management team.  He pointed out that Kiewit has started using RTD’s performance matrix at their corporate level.

Committee Chair Hoy pointed out that this presentation shows what a great organization RTD is as it points out why we do things the right way.

Director Folska asked for clarification on Kevin Diviness role and who he manages.  Kevin Diviness confirmed he is an RTD employee who manages 3 RTD employees and 2 consultants: Delcan and Kumar.

Director Folska suggested including the United States Access Board (Access Board) as a helpful addition to quality standards.  She said that when he mentioned concrete on the RTD Oversight Summary she thought of the Yale station, which has lots of not well cured stairs and no elevators.  Including quality standards from the Access Board would assist in these areas.

Director Folska noted that the presentation made reference to the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) guidelines but not to any Federal Railroad Administration guidelines (FRA).  Kevin Diviness explained that due to the amount of Federal funding through grants, the Eagle P3 project needs to abide by the FTA guidelines.  The FRA has requirements in order for the line to be open for service, but there are no quality guidelines.

Director Folska inquired regarding lessons learned from the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) on the I-225 rail line.  Rick Clarke, Assistant General Manager for Capital Programs, replied that part of Kevin Diviness efforts is an end of year lessons learned report.  Rick Clarke added that overall the EIS on I-225 has held up pretty well except for the Fitzimmons area.  Director Folska said she assumes that the lessons learned will be shared with other corridors and extensions.  Rick Clarke told Director Folska that his team will go to the Yale station and examine the stairs.  He noted that the station does have a ramp.  Director Folska pointed out the station needs an elevator.

Director Lubow asked which of the tools presented was used to determine the problems on the Jersey Cutoff bridge.  Kevin Diviness explained that the private contractor owned the risk of the bridge.  That particular bridge was produced at an offsite location.  During the process the contractor did not implement their own quality process appropriately.  He noted that RTD submitted comments concerning safety.  An independent source was contracted to assess the problems.  Since RTD had not accepted the bridge Denver Transit Partners (DTP) was able to demolish and reconstruct.  Kevin Diviness added that it was a painful, costly process for DTP.  Director Lubow asked if in his opinion the process worked.  Kevin Diviness replied that yes it worked in that the bridge was never in use.  What did not work was the contractor’s quality process.  Director Lubow asked if RTD staff would do anything differently.  Kevin Diviness replied that staff would do more process audits.  He added that some of the staff who worked on that project are now working on the North Metro line, bringing with them their experiences.

Committee Chair Hoy thanked staff for their great job.  He added that the North Metro rail line staff is very aware of the concerns Director Lubow raised.

##### a. Quality Management Update 2015

#### 2. FasTracks Public Information Update

Pauletta Tonilas, Senior Manager for Public Relations (PR) and Public Information (PI), reviewed the FasTracks Monitoring Committee Public Information Update presentation included in the FasTracks Monitoring Committee agenda packet for June 2, 2015.  The presentation covered FasTracks PI Transition, PI Plan, 2015 Year to Date Media Monitoring and Mentions, Social Media Activity, Community Presentations and Education including the use of mock rail crossings, Focus in Year Ahead, Coming Soon Events, and video collaboration with Im’Unique.

Pauletta Tonilas introduced Tyrone Beverly, Executive Director of Im’Unique.  Pauletta Tonilas mentioned that Tyrone Beverly was the Masters of Ceremony for the Stand Up 4 Transportation rally.  Tyrone Beverly introduced a video piece title “The Road to Change”, which features dancer Stefon Matthews as well as members of the Im’Unique community.  RTD collaborated in the production of the video by providing a special bus and use of a bus stop.  The video featured public transit as an agent of change helping communities move forward.

Committee Chair Hoy said that the video was great and very impactful.  Pauletta Tonilas pointed out that Stefon Matthews was the dancer during the Stand Up 4 Transportation rally.  Tyrone Beverly noted that his organization would like to continue the partnership with RTD through an event at Sports Authority Field at Mile High on July 25, 2015.  The idea is to have people meeting in one location and traveling via RTD to get there.  Committee Chair Hoy thanked Tyrone Beverly for such a great project and thanked him for leading the Stand Up 4 Transportation rally so well.

Director Folska thanked Tyrone Beverly and noted that man is usually the biggest barrier to most things.  Regarding the presentation, she said that she found the Media Monitoring and Mentions spreadsheets very informative.  Director Folska asked for more details on the use of mock crossings for education as light rail and commuter rail technologies are different.  Pauletta Tonilas said that commuter rail education will be using the same mock crossings that were prepared by the body shop for the West line education.  Dave Genova, Interim General Manager, added that the technology is different but the treatment is similar: flashing lights, gate arms, bells that ring, etc.  The idea is to get students and adults familiar with these basic elements.  Director Folska asked if commuter rail crossings have gates for pedestrians.  Rick Clarke, Assistant General Manager for Capital Programs, pointed out that some locations do have gates for pedestrian and not just motor vehicles.  He added that crossings near schools and high pedestrian traffic are the key areas for education.  He noted that the Federal Transit Authority (FTA) lauded this aspect of the program.  Dave Genova added that our light rail system follows FTA guidelines for operations, maintenance, and inspections as it is the only body that has standards.  Director Folska noted the importance of education as some people try to go around a train without noting another incoming train.  She requested that the Directors experience the mock crossing training.

Director Walker shared how the video reminded him of trains and buses after 8 o’clock at night when they become very friendly.  He asked Pauletta Tonilas if she thought her team had enough staff to do outreach for 5 lines.  Even if the lines are not opening at the same time, it seems like there is so much education that needs to happen.  Pauletta Tonilas replied that without a question having another body would be great; however, she praised her team as high-performing and involved in many community life aspects: schools, clubs, festivals, exhibits, electronic newsletters, media, milestone events, elected officials on the corridors, etc.  She added that the communication and education process is ever evolving and that her responsibility is to use our resources wisely.  Dave Genova reminded the Directors that Denver Transit Partners is responsible to develop a lot of the outreach and education alongside with RTD staff.  Director Walker said that if staff is comfortable with the resources then he is comfortable.  Pauletta Tonilas mentioned the contractors are part of the PI team.

Director Francone thanked Pauletta Tonilas for the map she requested.  Director Francone thanked Tyrone Beverly and requested the lyrics of the video for her son as they watched it together the night before.  She asked if the focus will remain on rail education as the PI team transitions to PR.  Pauletta Tonilas replied that safety education is big picture and includes buses, light rail, commuter rail, construction, etc.  She noted that a key message is that safety is a two way street; you have to participate to be safe.

Director Francone said that RTD could use more of these kinds of videos.  She asked for the amount RTD contributed to the production of the video.  Pauletta Tonilas answered that RTD’s contribution was coordination, use of bus, use of bus stop, and outreach/publicity for the video as it conveys transit’s role in breaking barriers.  Director Francone inquired for the plan to promote the July 25, 2015 event.  Pauletta Tonilas replied that RTD will work with Im’Unique to create another video project to promote the event.

Director Francone asked if RTD has an advertising relationship with the local Evergreen newspaper.  Pauletta Tonilas shared that RTD does not do a lot of media buying but more of public awareness campaigns as lines open.  Director Francone informed staff that the local Evergreen newspaper would like to have a relationship with RTD and reminded staff about the upcoming Summerfest in Evergreen as a great opportunity for education.

Director James thought the video was a great idea.  He thanked the PI team for assisting him with materials when he does presentations.  Director James wondered how RTD works with Transportation Management Associations (TMAs) and Organizations (TMOs) to leverage and maximize the growing interest in communities around the first/last mile concept and other subjects of interest.  Pauletta Tonilas shared that her team works frequently with TMAs and TMOs noting that a lot of them helped with the Stand Up 4 Transportation rally and will help out with communication during the line openings.  For the first/last mile issue, RTD is developing a relationship with Uber.  She added that another education aspect is redefining travel time as what you can do while you commute using public transit as opposed to driving.

Director James inquired as to the opening date for the East line.  Rick Clarke answered that contractually it is April.  The agreement requires the concessioner to inform RTD no later than 6 months ahead of time.

Director Tobiassen thanked Tyrone Beverly for the video adding that he would be sharing it on his Facebook page that evening.  He thanked the I-225/R line PI team for all their community meetings and outreach during the height of construction.  He suggested an I-225/R line outreach event on September 19th, Talk Like a Pirate Day.  Director Tobiassen invited the Directors to Aurora Kidspree on Saturday, Jun 6th as the mock crossing will be available at the event.  He suggested training police officers to enforce gate running summons.

Director Folska suggested using the Oktoberfest theme for all the BRT station parties scheduled for October.  She also suggested working with Boys Scouts and Girls Scouts using RTD to earn badges.  She shared her experience working with the Girls Scouts and the power of peer to peer education.

Committee Chair Hoy thanked staff for their work.  He mentioned how he still gets comments on the Denver Union Station (DUS) opening and how people refer to it as “our” DUS even if they do not live within the City and County of Denver boundaries.  This denotes the great work in PI and education.

Pauletta Tonilas invited the Directors to be at DUS on Saturday, June 6th at 10:30 a.m. as the Make-a-Wish Foundation (Foundation) will be fulfilling the dream of Jack, a 7 year old who wants to be a super hero.  RTD has partnered with the Foundation to provide the use of the Great Hall and the Bus Concourse for the event.  Director Menten asked if spectators were to dress in green and take part of the action.  Pauletta Tonilas encouraged any participants to dress in green as Jack’s super hero name will be the “Green Blaze”.  The Foundation will have signs on hand to cheer him on.
