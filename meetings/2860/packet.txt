Board Meeting Date:

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to award a contract
to 6e Technologies for BI Work Order Contract (Contract Number 19DH0XX) for an amount not to
exceed $2,500,000 over 5 years. Work is administered on an as-needed, work order basis. Funding
for these Work Orders will be included in the budgets of the projects on which the work is performed.
This action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
 Core Goal #3- Strong Financial Management
 Task Goal #3 – Ensure Fiscal Sustainability
 Task Goal #4 – Address Future Transportation Needs and Methods
BACKGROUND
RTD has need of an on-call contractor to provide technology services related to Business Intelligence.
RTD is moving into more data driven decision making. The District needs data to drive business
decisions hence the need for Business Intelligence IT services. RTD currently has a variety of BI tools
such as Oracle OBIEE, Oracle OACS, Informatica, Tableau, etc. The Work Orders (WOs) will be short to
mid-term periods addressing business, management of technology and consultant services. The activities
are inclusive of all activities necessary to support, enhance and update the BI tools and processes.
RTD anticipates the upcoming 5-year contract period may include work associated with several
initiatives around data including: Ridership Analytics, Realtime operational trend analytics, predictive
maintenance analytics, state of good repair and other ancillary analytic needs. RTD will also use this
contract to assist in maintaining day-to-day operations of the existing Oracle BI and Informatica tool sets
while the new systems/tools are being implemented.
DISCUSSION
RTD conducted an open procurement for a BI Work Order contractor. Five firms submitted proposals.
The criteria used to evaluate the proposals was:

The five members of the evaluation team selected two firms for final interviews. 6e Technologies was
selected as the successful proposer.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The contract authority shall not exceed $2,500,000. Funding for these Work Orders will be included in
the budgets of the projects on which the work is performed. The types of funds are dependent upon the
funding source of each individual project. Individual work orders will be funded as the project
requirement is processed. The amount is not to exceed $500,000.00 in any one year.
The current timeline and approximate costs for activities such as business process reviews,
implementation services, and system configuration for new implementations; assistance maintaining the
current BI systems; and other associated project work is as follows:
2019 - $ 500,000
2020 - $ 500,000
2021 - $ 500,000
2022 - $ 500,000
2023 - $ 500,000
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to award a
contract to 6e Technologies for BI Work Order Contract (Contract Number 19DH0XX) for an
amount not to exceed $2,500,000 over 5 years. Work is administered on an as-needed, work
order basis. Funding for these Work Orders will be included in the budgets of the projects on
which the work is performed.
2. Provide the needed services with RTD personnel. RTD personnel does not have the expertise or
capacity that can be provided by a work order contractor. This does not meet the needs of RTD.

Subject:

Board Commitment to FasTracks Completion
and Peak Service Plan

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Chair of the Board of Directors, Doug Tisdale, by the Chair of the
Planning/Capital Programs, & FasTracks Committee, Judy Lubow, and by Directors Buzek, Guissinger,
Lewis, and Whitmore that the Board of Directors approve the attached Resolution No. _____, Series of
2019, Regarding RTD Board Commitment for Finishing FasTracks and Supporting the Peak Service Plan
for Northwest Rail, as presented to the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee.
This recommendation is consistent with the General Manager’s 2019 Goals as follows:
 Core Goal #2 – Strong & Ethical Leadership;
 Core Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management;
 Core Goal #5 – Effective Communications & Community Outreach;
 Task Goal #3 – Ensure Fiscal Sustainability; and
 Task Goal #4 – Address Future Transportation Needs and Methods.
BACKGROUND
In 2004, the voters of the Regional Transportation District approved the FasTracks ballot initiative to
create a comprehensive rail and bus rapid transit project connecting Denver and its suburbs, with an
expected completion date of 2017 for the entire project. For a number of substantial reasons, some of
which are noted in the resolution, project completion did not occur in 2017. It is expected that by 2020,
approximately 70% of the project’s mileage will be completed. This will leave several sections of the
project not yet funded nor finished.
DISCUSSION
The proposed resolution is appropriate and beneficial because it has been 15 years since the passage of
the FasTracks initiative, several corridors remain unfunded and unfinished, and the voters and taxpayers
deserve assurance that the project is not being forgotten. The resolution will express the Board’s
acknowledgement of RTD’s legal responsibility to complete the unfinished FasTracks corridors and its
intention to do so in as expeditious a manner as possible.
Addressing the financial challenges facing RTD in completing this task, the resolution expresses the
Board’s directives to staff to investigate reasonable cost saving measures and to propose funding
mechanisms to construct and operate the unfinished FasTracks corridors, with a report of steps taken to
appropriately move forward to be provided within two months. Further addressing financial challenges,
the resolution also dictates that staff explore, fund, and facilitate construction and operation of a cost
saving measure for the unfinished Northwest Rail that is presently being evaluated by staff and
stakeholders – the Peak Service Plan. A report outlining proposed steps to appropriately move forward
with this Plan will also be required and submitted within two months.

12.B

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Aside from the staff time required to prepare the reports identified above, there is no additional fiscal
impact associated with the adoption of this resolution.
ALTERNATIVES
1. To adopt the attached resolution
2. To amend and adopt the amended resolution.
3. To reject the resolution.

Chair Doug Tisdale
RTD Board of Directors
1600 Blake Street
Denver, CO 80202
Dear Chair Tisdale,
Commuting Solutions is the Transportation Management Organization for the northwest metro region, which
joined the US 36 Mayors & Commissioners Coalition (MCC) to create a Policy Statement in 2014 that outlines the
coalition’s transportation priorities based on RTD’s Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS) completed that same
year.
Among other transportation improvements, the Policy Agenda includes a commitment to “support full completion
of the Northwest Commuter Rail project” as described in the final NAMS report. FasTracks and NAMS called for
fifty-five trains a day between Denver Union Station and Longmont, with a total estimated cost of $1.1-$1.4 billion
(2013 costs). In 2016, at the request of the MCC, RTD staff initiated an analysis of a more limited initial service
plan known as Peak Rail in the Northwest Rail corridor. Last year, the MCC approved and forwarded to RTD for
further analysis a recommended service plan consisting of three trains in morning peak travel time from
Longmont to Denver and three trains in evening peak travel time from Denver to Longmont. This analysis has not
yet been completed, as it does not include an estimated cost from BNSF to operate commuter rail from the
current end of line in Westminster to Longmont.
Simultaneously to advocating for rail, Commuting Solutions is also working on seeking funding and support for
building out arterial Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) corridors throughout the region from non-FasTracks sources, as
recommended by NAMS. These corridors are a very important, yet incomplete, element of the ultimate solution
to addressing the region’s mobility challenges as is regional passenger rail. Construction of these BRT corridors
does not in any way supplant Commuting Solutions’ commitment to ensuring construction of the Northwest Rail.
For this reason, a decision was made by the RTD board of directors to ensure that RTD funds spent on these
corridors do not come out of FasTracks revenue.
Commuting Solutions requests the RTD Board of Directors approve a proposed Resolution to fulfill the obligations
created in the FasTracks Program passed by RTD District voters in 2004 and support the continued development
for Peak Service Northwest Rail. We value our partnership with RTD and look forward to hearing a positive
outcome from the board on this important topic.
Sincerely,

Kathleen Bracke
Board Chairperson

Approval of IGA between RTD and the State's

Board Meeting Date:

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to execute an IGA
to develop and operate software to help manage LiVE Eligibility Applications through the State PEAK
software system (State Contract Management System (CMS) # 128691) for an amount not to exceed
$1,800,000. The IGA is for five (5) years of development, operations and maintenance.
This action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #3: Strong Financial Management
Task Goal #3: Ensure Fiscal Sustainability
BACKGROUND
RTD commits to reviewing its Fare Structure and Fare Programs every three years to determine if any
additions or changes are required to provide the best options for RTD ridership and meet RTD’s revenue
targets. As part of this process, the RTD Board of Directors approved a new Low-Income Fare (LiVE)
Program in mid-September 2018.
RTD is working with the Colorado Governor’s Office of Information Technology (OIT) to implement a
program for evaluating RTD riders’ eligibility for the LiVE program using the State’s public benefits
application system, PEAK. RTD staff has been meeting with employees from various departments and
OIT every week for several months.
The ability to leverage the State of Colorado systems to determine eligibility for the LiVE Program is
expected to:
 Reduce the time for implementation of the LiVE Program
 Limit duplication of data
 Allow for consistent eligibility data usage
 Reduce the time spent on administering the LiVE Program’s eligibility assessment
 Store sensitive data in the State system (For example, data will include pdfs of the application,
photographs, and verification of income information.
 Make it easier for those applying for other benefits to access RTD’s LiVE Program
 Save RTD significant expense
DISCUSSION
RTD needs to execute an Intergovernmental Agreement with OIT to implement the LiVE Program. The
IGA includes the following items:






Develop a Business Requirements Document (BRD) to identify necessary changes to the PEAK
System. This has been completed.
Develop a Technical Design Document (TDD) to identify the details for development of the
software changes to the PEAK system. This has been completed.
Perform software development to implement the BRD and TDD.
Test software changes when complete.
Provide operational support and maintenance for funning the applications, sending automated
RTD correspondence, store images and documents, provide system administration and provide
call center and help desk support for the application.

The design and software development changes shall be performed by OIT’s contractor for a fee.
Members of OIT and Members of the PEAK Executive Steering Committee have generously donated their
time to provide guidance, support, document development and review to support implementation of
RTD’s LiVE Program.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The contract authority shall not exceed $1,800,000. Funding for this project is included in the 2019
through 2023 Budget. The largest portion of these costs are for the software changes being developed
this year. Annual correspondence, operations, maintenance and customer support are not expected to
exceed $211,000 per year during the term of this agreement.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to
execute an IGA to develop and operate software to help manage LiVE Eligibility Applications
through the State PEAK software system (State Contract Management System (CMS) # 128691)
for an amount not to exceed $1,800,000. The IGA is for five (5) years of development,
operations and maintenance.
2. RTD can independently, or through a contractor, develop software to accept and evaluate
applications for the LiVE program. RTD does not have the resources to adequately support the
system 24/7 and continuously meet Personally Identifiable Information (PII) security standards.
Development of such a system from scratch would take more than a year to implement and
would be appreciably more expensive. This would put implementation of the LiVE Program and
RTD security systems at significant risk.
3. RTD can develop a process to manually accept and evaluate applications for the LiVE Program.
This would require development of new policies and procedures and the hiring of more than 5
new employees. This would take more time and cost significantly more to implement.
