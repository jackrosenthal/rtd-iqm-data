Subject:

Selection of Location for Posting of Board
Notice

RECOMMENDED ACTION
The RTD Board of Directors designates the entry way of the RTD administrative office at 1600 Blake
Street as its official location for posting of notices of all public meetings in 2013 as required by C.R.S.
24-6-402(2)(c). In addition, to the maximum extent feasible, notices of public meetings will be posted
on RTD’s website.
BACKGROUND
Section 32-9-116 of the RTD Act requires all meetings of the Board to be held within the district and
open to the public. No business of the Board shall be transacted except at a regular or special meeting
at which a quorum consisting of at least a majority of the total membership of the Board is present.
C.R.S. 24-6-402(2) (c) of the Colorado Open Meetings Law provides definition of what constitutes an
open meeting and the process for notification. Article IV, section 5b of the Board Bylaws states notices
of all meetings shall be posted at least twenty-four hours in the public place designated annually by the
Board for the posting of notices prior to the holding of a meeting in the public place.
The purpose of this Board action is to designate the official posting site for notices of all public meetings
in 2013.
DISCUSSION
The Board has implemented a paperless solution and will provide notices of Board meetings utilizing a
web portal for public access. Publication of notices may also be found on this website but does not
replace the primary posting location of entry way at 1600 Blake Street.

Approval of Boundary Mapping Contract Option
- Farnsworth Group

Van

Meter,

Assistant

Date: January 3, 2013
General

GM
Board Meeting Date: January 8, 2013

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to exercise a one year
contract option to Farnsworth Group for an extension of the existing contract through 2013 in an
amount not to exceed $68,900 which would make the contract amount $295,100.
BACKGROUND
The contract was awarded to Farnsworth Group in late 2009 following a competitive bid of 5 submitted
proposals. Farnsworth provides RTD with boundary mapping services. These services include tracking
annexations by jurisdictions along the District’s boundaries, and the corresponding changes to the
respective Director Districts, as well as ensuring RTD is up to date with the appropriate precinct rolls by
county for each Director District.
The contract included five option years; this requested action would be to exercise the third year option.
The Contract Not-To-Exceed amount for 2013 is $68,900.
DISCUSSION
The contract support is critical to RTD so that staff is able to maintain an accurate, up-to-date boundary
map that allows RTD to determine which residents and businesses are in or out of the District thereby
maximizing RTD’s sales tax collections. Also, the boundary map is used to determine who is eligible for
in-District parking privileges and who should be required to pay out-of-District rates. Additionally,
counties within the District often modify precinct boundaries. It is imperative for RTD to have the most
up-to-date precinct boundaries whenever a general or special election is required so that RTD can certify
the precinct list for the respective Director District.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Cost to the District to exercise the option from Farnsworth Group is for an amount not to exceed
$68,900. Sufficient funding has been included in the 2013 expense budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee
that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents
necessary to exercise a one year contract option to Farnsworth Group for an extension of the
existing contract through 2013 in an amount not to exceed $68,900 which would make the contract
amount $295,100.
2. Do not approve the option to extend the contract with Farnsworth Group.
recommended for the following reasons:

This action is not

RTD will not be able to determine when annexations have occurred by local jurisdictions along
the District boundary and will thereby lose sales taxes generated in newly annexed areas; and
RTD will not be able to accurately determine who is eligible for in-District parking privileges
and who should be required to pay out-of-District rates; and
RTD will not have an accurate list of County precincts and will not be able to certify precinct
lists for Director Districts for regularly scheduled or special elections thereby compromising
the election process.
