I.

INTRODUCTION
The Regional Transportation District (RTD) serves a population of 2.92 million, in 38
municipalities within eight counties, and with an area of 2,342 square miles. RTD owns and
operates multiple buildings, structures, and parking areas, including parking garages, Park‐n‐
Rides, operation buildings, and administrative buildings.
Denver Union Station (DUS) is RTD’s main downtown transit hub, connecting commuter rail,
light rail, Amtrak, the Free MallRide and Free MetroRide, and local, intercity, and
interregional bus lines. Private bus operators have approached RTD requesting access to
gates within the DUS Bus Concourse.
RTD has issued this Request for Information (RFI) to determine the following:
 Extent of the interest from bus operators in operating out of DUS;
 Needs of those operators and;
 Operators’ ability to respond to challenges associated with moving into an existing
operating facility where the first priority is accommodating RTD operations (issues
described further herein).

II.

PURPOSE OF RFI
The purpose of the RFI is to allow interested operators an opportunity to express their
interest and present the requested information to RTD. The RFI should be considered a
request for information that will assist RTD in evaluating options for distributing DUS Bus
Concourse space among interested operators and the potential revenues to be derived from
that distribution. Depending on the information RTD gathers through the RFI, RTD may issue
a Request for Proposals (RFP). This RFI is not a solicitation or request for proposals that will
result in a contractual relationship with RTD and will not commit RTD to enter into a further
agreement with any respondent.

III.

BACKGROUND
The DUS Bus Concourse is a light-filled, modern, underground bus facility. It is 1,000 feet
long and runs beneath 17th Street from the Union Station Light Rail tracks at Chestnut Place
to the Union Station Historic Building and commuter rail tracks between Wewatta Street and
Wynkoop Street.

Request for Information
Denver Union Station Bus Facility Shared Use

Figure 1. Denver Union Station Bus Concourse Location Map
The DUS Bus Concourse contains 22 bus gates. In addition to Local and Regional RTD buses,
the Bus Concourse currently hosts select trips and routes operated by Greyhound Lines, Black
Hills Stage Lines, and Bustang routes operated by the Colorado Department of
Transportation (CDOT). All non-RTD operators currently have schedules that allow them to
schedule all departures from the same gate (B3) and arrivals are at the first available gate or
assigned outside of peak hours. RTD does not currently schedule any departures from gate
B3. Non-RTD operators are not currently charged for access to the Bus Concourse; however,
it is RTD’s intent to consider charging private operators for access. This RFI is intended to
help RTD gauge private sector interest and capacity to pay for DUS Bus Concourse space.
Current RTD peak hour operating procedures within the DUS Bus Concourse require arriving
buses to alight their passengers at the first available gate (with some exceptions), from
which the bus then proceeds to a staging location or exits the facility to interline to another
route outside of Union Station. This procedure could be applied by non-RTD carriers, allowing

1.C.2.a

RTD has done a preliminary study of the Denver Bus Center and its users’ schedules,
including Greyhound Lines, Black Hills Stage Lines, and Burlington Trailways. The preliminary
study determined that all arrivals and departures occurring outside of the peak periods can
be accommodated as RTD service is reduced outside of the peak periods and many gates are
unused at those times. Within weekday peak periods (6am-9am and 3pm-6pm), both arrivals
and departures would likely be able to be accommodated, but exact timing and operational
needs for each operator would have to be considered. It is possible that short layovers could
be accommodated during off-peak periods, but even short layovers would be difficult to
accommodate during peak periods. DUS does not have the space or infrastructure to
accommodate maintenance functions typically carried out at a terminal facility.
It might be possible to dedicate a set of gates to exclusive non-RTD carrier use depending on
the level of service required, but it would be preferable for the operation of the station if the
intercity carriers share gates with RTD due to the relatively limited service offered by the
intercity carriers. The direction of the I-25 HOV lane heavily dictates where RTD buses are
entering and leaving Union Station, and therefore which side of the station RTD buses board
and alight passengers. Dedicating exclusive gates on the “HOV side” of the station for the
appropriate peak hour would negatively impact RTD operations when intercity carriers would
only use those gates for a few minutes during that peak hour.

CHALLENGES AND POTENTIAL ISSUES
Additional buses and passengers making use of the DUS Bus Concourse and Historic Building
could create operational challenges. RTD has identified the following challenges and
accompanying questions for Respondents to the RFI:
a. Restrooms
DUS restroom facilities are already approaching capacity. What criteria does the
Respondent currently have for determining restroom requirements and accommodations?
How many new passengers will require restroom services and how does the Respondent
propose to meet the new demand?
b. Waiting Facilities
New passengers will require space and furniture to make their waits more comfortable,
especially during service delays. How many daily boardings does the Respondent expect

3
Packet Pg. 17

Attachment: DUS Request for Information (RFI) 9 12 17 (3259 : DUS Request for Information (RFI) 9 12 17)

arriving buses to alight passengers and unload baggage at any gate or set of gates, before
proceeding out of Union Station to an off-site yard, depot, or staging area.

and how much time do the Respondent’s passengers typically spend waiting for their
buses? How will the Respondent ensure that new passengers are accommodated at DUS,
both in the historic building and the bus concourse?
Ticket Sales & Information
Does the Respondent anticipate their passengers needing to buy tickets at the DUS
facility or is all ticketing done online or on the bus? How and where will tickets be sold or
information be offered for the new services at DUS? What wayfinding/signage
requirements would the Respondent require to direct passengers to their gates?
Security
The addition of passengers creates the need for additional security. What level of
security does the Respondent currently employ on vehicles and at stations? How will the
Respondent ensure sufficient security is provided at DUS?
Vending
The DUS Historic Building and immediate neighborhood offers many excellent retail
establishments. Will the existing businesses adequately serve the Respondent’s
customers? If not, what additional vending does the Respondent propose?
Baggage & Package Handling
Space is limited throughout DUS. How does the Respondent propose to meet the needs
of customers with baggage and packages?
Scheduling & Gate Usage
Based on the information provided in Section III, how would the Respondent’s
operational requirements be successfully integrated into RTD’s operations in the Bus
Concourse? How might scheduling and gate requirements change in the future?
Contractual Agreement to Operate in the DUS Bus Concourse
Because of the potential for future service changes, RTD may require that the license
allowing non-RTD bus operators to operate in the DUS Bus Concourse be amended or
revoked with six months’ notice. What effect would this have on the Respondent?
Experience with Shared Facilities
What experience does the Respondent have as a tenant sharing facilities or gates with
other operators, both in Denver and elsewhere? What challenges have these situations
presented and/or how have they been successful?

ADA Expert Second Annual Report

As required by the Settlement Agreement between RTD and the Colorado Cross Disability Coalition
(CCDC), RTD retained the services of an “ADA Expert” to “review, audit, and prepare a written report
(“Initial Expert Report”) to ensure that RTD implements and enforces the policy required by the
Agreement.” This policy, Boarding Individuals with Disabilities Who Use Mobility Aids to Ensure Access
and referred to as the Policy, was designed to ensure that individuals with disabilities who use mobility
aids have equal access to fixed-route buses. The “Initial Expert Report” was shared with the Board of
Directors in November of 2014.
The Settlement Agreement required that the ADA Expert return to RTD “to review, audit and prepare a
written follow-up report to ensure that RTD has taken the actions identified in the Initial Expert Report
(“Mid-Year Report”)”. The “Mid-Year Report” was shared with the Board of Directors in September of
2015. Additionally, the ADA Expert was to return to RTD on an annual basis for the next three years to
assess the agency’s continued compliance with the Settlement Agreement requirements. The “First
Annual Report” was shared with the Board of Directors in July of 2016.
In June, 2017, KFH Group, Inc., of Bethesda, Maryland, (the “ADA Expert”) returned to Denver for the
purpose of preparing the second of three “Annual Reports” as required by the Settlement Agreement.
The “Second Annual Report” was prepared based on data collected by KFH Group, and it included
interviews with RTD staff personnel and members of the disability community and observations made
while riding several RTD buses. A review was also conducted on the current pass-up incident data and
ADA-related customer complaints for fixed-route bus service.
The conclusions presented by KFH Group, Inc., stated that “RTD is continuing its efforts to follow the
requirements set out in the Settlement Agreement. This includes collecting and reporting data required
for the Securement Area Report and investigating complaints related to the Policy.” The ADA Expert
also acknowledged several efforts made by RTD which are helping improve bus service for riders with
disabilities. Several of these efforts addressed items identified in the ADA Expert’s prior reports:
 Involvement of an ad-hoc group of riders with disabilities in the seating configuration of new 40foot transit buses.
 Implementation of the new Code of Conduct and providing accessibility information on the RTD
website.
 Implementation of improved processes for investigating and responding to customer complaints
regarding service for people with disabilities.
Although the ADA Expert did not identify any formal deficiencies, the following actions were
recommended for work in 2017:
 Priority Access: RTD should continue to reinforce its policy with operators to give riders with
disabilities priority access for boarding the bus.

Packet Pg. 20

1.C.3

 Include Priority Access for Riders with Mobility Aids in Code of Conduct: RTD should amend
Action #39 in the Code of Conduct to include wording that riders with wheelchairs and other
mobility aids should be given priority boarding access.
 Extra Space Area: RTD should consider designating the Extra Space Area as a second Priority
Seating area.
 Reconfigured Extra Space Area: With new bus procurements, RTD should consider enlarging the
Extra Space Area to provide adequate space for walkers.
 International Wheelchair Symbol on Floor Designating Securement Area: The new 40-foot transit
buses have blue flooring in the Securement Area. RTD should consider adding the universal
wheelchair symbol on the blue floor.
 3900 Series Buses: Because of the maneuvering difficulty riders using wheelchairs and other
mobility aids have on these 30-foot transit buses, RTD should consider deploying these buses on
routes with low ridership by those using wheelchairs and other mobility aids.
 Involve Riders with Disabilities When Planning New Bus Procurements: RTD should continue to
solicit input from riders with disabilities when planning new bus procurements.
A copy of the Second Annual Report from KFH Group, Inc., is attached to this report.

Contracted Fixed-Route Quarterly Report – 2nd
Quarter 2017

Information

The following is a discussion of the performance measures for the second quarter of 2017 for the fixedroute services provided by private contractors:


PREVENTABLE VEHICLE ACCIDENTS PER 100,000 MILES
The contractors, individually and as a group, met the target of ≤ 2.0 Preventable Vehicle
Accidents per 100,000 miles in the 2nd quarter. First Transit and Transdev continue to utilize
bus operator monitoring technology and post-accident investigations for retraining of operators.
The contractors continue to emphasize safety with all employees at monthly safety meetings,
through periodic campaigns, and with daily reminders at their facilities.



PASSENGER ACCIDENT RATIO PER 100,000 MILES
The contractors, individually and as a group, met the target of ≤ 0.18 Passenger Accidents per
100,000 miles in the 2nd quarter. All of the passenger accidents that occurred through the 2nd
quarter were classified non-preventable. First Transit and Transdev continue to raise awareness
of passenger safety through campaigns and safety meetings to reduce the number of passenger
accidents per 100,000 miles.



ON-TIME PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE INSPECTIONS
The contractors, individually and as a group, met the target of 98% of Preventive Maintenance
Inspections completed as scheduled in the 2nd quarter. RTD and the contractor organizations
place a high emphasis on completing preventive maintenance inspections as required, and as
such, the local operations are diligent about completing these inspections on time.



ON-TIME PERFORMANCE
Transdev and First Transit Longmont met the target of 88% Local On-Time Service with 88.2%
and 88.5% on-time performance in the 2nd quarter. First Transit Denver (87.5%) and First
Transit Commerce City (84.0%) did not meet the goal due in part to the high number of new
operators, unexpected detours, and traffic. RTD and the private contractors continue to
campaign routes and operators with low on time performance with a strong focus on first time
point departures. On a monthly basis contractors review the OTP report and meet with operators
of low performing routes to discuss factors that are impacting their ability to reach 88% on time
performance. Running time issues are forwarded to RTD Service Planning and Scheduling for
review.
The contractors will continue to address on-time performance issues with operators, but always
tie safety to the discussion. It’s better to be a few minutes late than to have an accident.

Packet Pg. 22

1.C.4



MILES BETWEEN LOST SERVICE ROAD CALLS
The contractors, individually and as a group, exceeded the target of 30,000 Miles Between Lost
Service Maintenance Road Calls in the 2nd quarter. The contractors continue to address this area
by completing preventive maintenance inspections on time, working off defects in a timely
manner, monitoring repeat issues, providing additional training for mechanics, and taking a proactive approach to maintaining the buses in their fleets.



OPERATOR COMPLAINTS PER BOARDING
2nd quarter 2017 ridership was not available at the time this report was prepared and as a result
Complaints per Boarding have not been calculated. The contractors did receive 1,031 less
complaints year to date through the 2nd quarter 2017 when compared to the same time period in
2016. The contractors continue to utilize onboard video surveillance as a coaching tool to assist
operators in improving customer interactions. In addition, the steps noted above regarding ontime performance have helped address some customer complaints. The contractors also continue
to address complaint trends with all operators at monthly safety meetings.
The contractors continue to take a variety of actions over and above contract requirements to
address their operator hiring/retention challenges which include hiring bonuses, wage increases,
incentives to take on additional work, employing a full-time recruiter, and mentoring programs.

Access-a-Ride/Cab 2nd Quarter Update - 2017

Ridership
Access-a-Ride ridership increased by 1.5% through the 2nd quarter of 2017 compared to the same period
of 2016. Productivity slightly decreased from 1.24 to 1.23 passengers per hour. During the same
period, Access-a-Cab ridership decreased by 16%. Combined Access-a-Ride and Access-a-Cab ridership
decreased by 1.9% compared to 2016.
Revenue Hours
Revenue hours of service provided on Access-a-Ride increased by 2.6% during the 2nd quarter of 2017
as compared to the same period of 2016. Access-a-Ride is approximately 7% under budgeted revenue
hours through the second quarter of 2017.
On-Time Performance
Carrier on-time performance through the 2nd quarter of 2017 was 96.10%; an increase when compared
to the same period of 2016 (95.30).
Passenger on-time performance through the 2nd quarter of 2017 was 85.81%; an increase when
compared to the same period in 2016 (83.87).
On-time performance improved resulting from an increase to operator wages which went into effect,
April 2017. The recent change to operator wages has contributed to improvements in our carrier’s
abilities to hire qualified staff and is reflected in a major reduction in the number of dropped trips and in
improved on-time performance.
Customer Complaints
Access-a-Ride complaints decreased through the 2nd quarter of 2017 as compared to the same period in
2016. Staff continues to work with our carriers and passengers to improve overall customer satisfaction.

Comments:
Call-n-Ride technology changes: continued improvement with a new manifest being deployed within
the Call-n-Ride services. Working on a possible trip exchange program involving Transportation
Network Company (TNC) such as taxi cabs and companies like Lyft and Uber.

Have requested marketing in certain low ridership Call-n-Ride areas including Broomfield, Interlocken,
Lone Tree, S. Jeffco and Thornton.
Call-n-Ride ridership declines May-August due to school not being in session.
In the August 2017 RTD Service Changes, the Thornton Call-n-Ride will begin serving the new
Adams County Human Services center that opens in September 2017. The Golden Call-n-Ride will
add a 2nd vehicle to the flex route, that will increase service to every 15 minutes. The City of Golden
will pay for this service increase.

Monitoring

In compliance with the Recommendation included in the Performance Audit of the RTD conducted in
2015 on behalf of the State of Colorado, the following is a summary of the monitoring activities
completed by RTD Drug & Alcohol compliance personnel through the 2nd Quarter of 2017. These
statistics represent the verification of records reviewed for the private contractor operations.
Number of files reviewed:

Percentage of records in compliance with requirements:

All documents pertaining to testing are reviewed every quarter. Once exceptions are noted, RTD staff
returns to the contractor location to ensure that missing documentation has been obtained. Any
exceptions not addressed are noted and reviewed during the next visit to ensure exceptions have been
corrected.
Scheduled visits for the contractors are no less than quarterly and on-going on an as-needed basis. This
audit schedule was implemented in March of 2016.

Board Meeting Date: September 12, 2017

Subject:

2017 2nd
Analysis

Quarter

Customer

Complaint

Recapped below is an analysis of the customer complaint trends for the 2nd Quarter of 2017.
included is a comparison of customer complaint data for the same period in 2016.

Also

As noted in previous reports, in 2007 and 2008, RTD and the private contractors were meeting the
performance goal for customer complaints of .0002 complaints per passenger boarding. In 2009, RTD
began stricter enforcement of the fare policy and the priority seating area policy which advised
passengers with strollers or other large items that they would need to move from the priority seating
area if those seats were needed for disabled passengers. In addition, RTD posted notices on all buses
and light rail vehicles advising passengers of the requirement under Title VI of the Civil Rights Law for
operators to call out transfer points. Following the implementation of these policies/procedures,
customer complaints increased, but for 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 RTD and the private contractors
performed, for the most part, at a level of .0003 to .0004 complaints per passenger boarding. In 2012,
the performance goal for passenger complaints was adjusted to .0003 complaints per passenger
boarding. The goal for 2014 was again adjusted to account for the static higher level of complaints due
to the securement area/priority seating issues, the fare enforcement campaigns, TIC availability,
introduction of SmartCards, and the new West Line service. The goal for 2015 and 2016 remained at
.0004 complaints per passenger boarding. The 2017 goal was again set at .0004 complaints per
passenger boarding.
Ridership data for the 2nd Quarter of 2017 was not available at the time this report was completed.
Therefore, the Complaints per Passenger Boarding was not calculated. However, the total number of
complaints decreased by 2,925 as compared to the 2nd Quarter of 2016.
RTD staff, as well as the private contractors, monitor and address customer complaints on a daily basis.
RTD and the private contractors investigate all customer complaints using a variety of tools, including
CAD/AVL “flashbacks” and video review and address/discipline operators as needed. Many times the
results of the investigation reveal that the complaint is not valid. Some of the reasons for the “Not
Valid” classification include the following:
Bus was on time (between 1 min early to 5 min late) per “flashback”
Operator followed proper procedure
Passenger presented insufficient fare
Passenger had no proof of eligibility for a discounted fare
Passenger presented an expired transfer
Passenger presented a counterfeit pass
Buses were running late District-wide due to weather
There was no video evidence to support the complaint
RTD and the private contractors continue to work collectively in a variety of different areas to address
customer complaints.

Bus routes with poor on-time performance are monitored by both RTD and private contractor
personnel to determine if the problem is related to the operator or the running time of the route.
Meetings are held on a monthly basis with contractor and RTD personnel to discuss challenges,
solutions and best practices in the areas of bus maintenance, operations, safety and training.
RTD conducts refresher training for all operators on an annual basis, and a component of the
training is customer service. The private contractors conduct mandatory monthly safety meetings
wherein they discuss customer service issues and provide suggestions for improving passenger
interactions.
RTD and private contractor trainers spend time at Civic Center Station (and the alternate
boarding/deboarding locations during CCS construction) and Denver Union Station the first week
of each runboard to provide assistance to operators who may need some refreshers on station
procedures or have questions on their routes.
RTD has also reached out to the disability community (Colorado Cross Disability Coalition,
Colorado School of the Blind, Atlantis, DRMAC Transit Accessibility Task Force) to get feedback
on ways to improve RTD service for passengers with disabilities.
Operators are recognized for the good customer service they provide.
Divisions post
commendations on a bulletin board in the drivers’ room and some provide additional means of
recognition.

Historically, and in 2017, the following complaint categories generated the highest number of customer
complaints:
Bus Did Not Show
Bus Early
Bus Late
Careless Driving/Operator
Discourtesy/Operator
Improper Procedure by Operator
Passed Up Passenger at Stop
All of these complaint categories are what RTD considers “operator related” and are included in the
complaint numbers that are tracked and reported to the Board of Directors on the Quarterly Performance
Report.
The high complaint categories are routinely reviewed to determine the factors, both internal and
external, that are impacting the number of complaints. The input received from both RTD and private
contractor operations is noted below:
Bus Did Not Show – 2nd Quarter 2017: the complaints in this category decreased 23.4% compared to
the same period in 2016. RTD and the private contractors continue to focus on trying to reduce
operator vcancie. RTD and the private contractors continue to focus on timely pull-outs and providing
service per published schedules. The YTD average in this category for 2017 is 5.44 complaints per day.
The comparable number for 2016 was 7.10 complaints per day.
Bus Early – 2nd Quarter 2017: complaints in this category decreased 6.3% compared to the same period
in 2016. “Flashbacks” for “bus early” complaints often show buses running late. It is possible
passengers see the prior bus running late and will assume it is their bus running early. Operators are
addressed whenever the CAD/AVL playback confirms that the bus was running ahead of schedule. The
YTD average in this category for 2017 is 4.72 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2016
was 5.04 complaints per day.

Packet Pg. 46

1.C.8

Bus Late – 2nd Quarter 2017: complaints in this category decreased 32.1% compared to the same
period in 2016. This category has been impacted by the operator shortages. However, occasional
improvements to staffing have resulted in periodic improvements in this category. Improving on-time
performance continues to be a challenge for a variety of reasons including construction, traffic and
heavy ridership delays; service reductions, which result in the same number of passengers on fewer
trips; and the inability to fund service improvements to address running-time issues. The YTD average in
this category for 2017 is 7.22 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2016 was 10.64
complaints per day.
Careless Driving/Operator – 2nd Quarter 2017: complaints in this category decreased 13.6% compared
to the same period in 2016. On a regular basis, video recordings are reviewed and undercover ride
checks are performed to determine if operators are driving in an unsafe or inappropriate manner. In
addition, RTD and the private contractors have “G-force activated” event-recording systems (Drive Cam,
Smart Drive) installed on the buses. These incidents are also reviewed on a daily basis. Operators
continue to be counseled and retrained as needed to improve driving performance. Also, periodic safety
campaigns are conducted to reinforce safe driving habits. The YTD average in this category for 2017 is
3.52 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2016 was 4.08 complaints per day.
Discourtesy/Operator – 2nd Quarter 2017: complaints in this category decreased 31.2% compared to
the same period in 2016. In the majority of cases, video evidence confirms that the operator followed
proper procedures and treated the customer with respect. In many cases, operators are shown
enforcing or explaining policies (requesting proper fare payment, requesting space in the priority seating
area, addressing inappropriate behavior) in a polite and respectful manner and the passengers react in a
negative manner. Operators are counseled and disciplined if video evidence confirms that they treated
passengers in a discourteous or inappropriate manner. Operators are also given suggestions for handling
similar situations in the future. The YTD average in this category for 2017 is 7.37 complaints per day.
The comparable number for 2016 was 10.72 complaints per day.
Discrimination – 2nd Quarter 2017: complaints in this category increased 16.2% compared to the same
period in 2016. Investigation into discrimination-related complaints usually shows the operator not at
fault. The YTD average in this category for 2017 is 0.24 complaints per day. The comparable number
for 2016 was 0.20 complaints per day.
Fare Dispute – 2nd Quarter 2017: complaints in this category decreased 22.2% compared to the same
period in 2016. The implementation of the new fares and fare equipment resulted in an increase in
complaints. Investigations into “fare dispute” complaints often show that passengers presented an
improper/incomplete fare and are not happy with the operators’ enforcement of the fare policies. The
YTD average in this category for 2017 is 1.04 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2016
was 1.34 complaints per day.
Improper Procedure/Operator – 2nd Quarter 2017: complaints in this category decreased 32.6%
compared to the same period in 2016. RTD and private contractor training and operations personnel
meet on a regular basis to ensure all operators are receiving consistent and up-to-date information. In
addition, the on-going refresher training provided to RTD operators and the monthly safety meetings held
at the private contractor divisions provide operators with information about accommodating the needs of
RTD passengers to the best of their abilities. In cases where video evidence shows operators are not
following proper procedures, appropriate coaching activities are undertaken. The YTD average in this
category for 2017 is 5.86 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2016 was 8.69 complaints
per day.

Packet Pg. 47

1.C.8

Incorrect Info/Operator – 2nd Quarter 2017: complaints in this category decreased 30.1% compared to
the same period in 2016. The combined efforts of the General Superintendent of Transportation, the
Bus Operator Training teams, Street Supervisors and Dispatchers continue to provide operators with upto-date information to answer customer questions and address customer concerns. The YTD average in
the category for 2017 is 0.36 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2016 was 0.51
complaints per day.
Passed Up Passenger At Stop – 2nd Quarter 2017: complaints in this category decreased 12.5%
compared to the same period in 2016. In many cases, “flashbacks” for these complaints will confirm
buses are on route and either on time or running late. It is possible the passenger was not directly at the
stop when the bus arrived. Many complaint comments indicate the passenger was running to the stop
as the bus passed. Operators are reminded to stay vigilant and watch for passengers that may not be
waiting directly at the bus stop. In addition, operators are directed to contact RTD Dispatch whenever a
passenger is passed up due to the bus being full. The number of “Pass Up” complaints from passengers
with disabilities and/or those using mobility aids represents a small number of the total “Pass Up”
complaints (73 of the total 1,783 = 4.09%). Information regarding overcrowded routes is forwarded to
the Service Planning & Scheduling Department for review and adjustment as needed and as resources
will allow. The YTD average in this category for 2017 is 9.85 complaints per day. The comparable
number for 2016 was 11.26 complaints per day.
Customer Satisfaction Survey
Customer complaints help identify those areas in which RTD and the private contractors can continue to
improve the quality of service provided. Additionally, the results of the 2014 Customer Satisfaction
Survey indicate that the majority of RTD passengers are satisfied with RTD services. On a scale of 1
(very poor) to 5 (excellent), RTD bus service received high ratings in the following operator-related
categories:
Courtesy of bus driver (4.4)
Driving skills (4.4)
Drivers’ knowledge of their specific route (4.4)
Drivers’ ability to answer your questions about bus service (4.3)
Feeling of safety on bus (4.2)
Clarity of onboard stop announcements (4.2)

Quarterly Board of Directors Report
Security Statistics & Fare Inspection Summary
Second Quarter ~ April 1 through June 30, 2017

Fare inspectors, security officers, street supervisors, and police officers, conduct fare inspection on‐board buses
and light rail vehicles. RTD’s policy is to provide a warning to first time offenders and then to issue a citation if
that person is contacted a second time without fare. The chart below shows the actual number of patrons
without fare that resulted in warnings or citations. The variation in numbers from month to month may be due
to several factors: special events or other security security‐related incidents.

Transit security officers are assigned to Light Rail and Commuter Rail to check for proper fare and to provide
security. The table below shows how many patrons were contacted for the quarter and the percentage of
patrons that did not present valid fare. There is also a designated transit security officer fare task force, whose
duties are to only ride light rail vehicles and concentrate on fare related issues throughout the service area.

Plain Clothes Police Officer Fare Inspection

The following tables lists the number of patron boardings observed, no fare or partial fares, the estimated fare
evasion rate, the number of warnings and citations issued, and the number of arrests made by police officers.
Arrests include citations issued or physical arrests made for criminal violations other than fare evasion. This is an
additional advantage to the plain clothes police fare inspection program as peace officers have the authority to
check for warrants and take the appropriate law enforcement action. This quarter the bus routes inspected
include the 15, 16, 31 & 0.

The below chart shows the plain clothes police fare enforcement observations for light rail. There is a slightly
higher fare evasion rate observed by the plain clothes program than for the rail station sweeps and bus
enforcement because of the following factors:
Fare station sweeps are conducted by uniformed security officers; these officers require all patrons to
have fare before boarding vehicles
Rail operators do not have any interface with patrons, while bus operators do ask for fare
Plain clothes police officers do not have a deterrence factor as uniformed officers, thus they inherently
find more violations of fare evasion.
