BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
System Advertising Contract

Committee Meeting Date:
June 8, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
June 8, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO, or her authorized designee, to
execute all documents necessary to negotiate and enter into a contract with Lamar Transit for the
System Advertising Program agreement, in an amount not to exceed $63 million during the base tenyear term and a 70% revenue share to RTD above the minimum annual guarantee with two five-year
options.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Pauletta Tonilas, AGM, Communications
Adrian Mabry, Manager, Projects & Contracts, Communications
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD has an on-vehicle advertising program to generate advertising revenue for the agency. On-vehicle
advertising includes bus and rail exterior and interior ads. RTD has received between $3.1 million to
$3.4 million in a minimum annual guarantee (MAG) of revenue over the past several years. In addition to
the MAG, RTD receives a revenue share with the advertising vendor that pays RTD 60% of revenue over
and above the MAG.
In 2017, staff began discussing the opportunity to add digital displays to leverage the advertising
program to enhance the customer experience and generate additional revenue. Digital displays have the
ability to share real-time digital customer information and messages as well as advertising. Staff has
actively pursued an enhanced approach to system advertising that would include a digital advertising
solution. Those actions include:
•

2018 – RTD released a Request for Proposals (RFP) for digital advertising only. The RFP was
retracted in order for RTD to pursue a more enhanced and unified system advertising program.

•

2019 – Staff performed additional research on digital signage and digital advertising to inform a
combined System Advertising Program RFP.

•

March 2020 – RTD published a Request for Information (RFI) addressing several aspects of a future
digital advertising program. Responses received informed the System Advertising Program RFP.

•

November 2020 – RTD released the System Advertising Program RFP.

DISCUSSION
The System Advertising RFP is designed to enhance the existing on-vehicle advertising program to
include a digital advertising program as well. This approach has three main goals:

Packet Pg. 4

2.11.A

1. Enhance the customer experience by providing real-time, relevant customer information and
messages on digital displays at stations and major transfer centers and stops.
2. Unify RTD’s existing public information displays (PIDs) system with the new digital displays under
a single content management system (CMS).
3. Generate additional advertising revenue for RTD.
In February 2021, four proposals were received from Banner, Vector, Intersection, and Lamar. One
proposal (Banner) was declared non-responsive as it included simply a pricing sheet for vehicle wraps. A
cross-functional internal team evaluated the three remaining proposals, of which two were deemed
technically viable (Intersection and Lamar). The evaluation team conducted a comprehensive evaluation
of the two proposals which included several rounds of questions and presentations from the two
proposers.
The evaluation team unanimously recommends the selection of Lamar Transit. Taking into consideration
the technical aspects of the proposal along with the revenue proposal, Lamar emerged as the strongest
overall solution.
Lamar’s proposal emphasized over 20 years of on-vehicle advertising experience with RTD as well as
extensive knowledge of the Denver market. Lamar also presented a clearly defined plan for planning and
implementation of digital displays across the RTD system. In addition, Lamar proposed a clear plan for
how the contractor would integrate with RTD’s existing legacy system of digital displays under a new
content management system (CMS) and how the firm will handle service and maintenance on the legacy
displays as well as the new displays.
Lamar proposed 585 new screen deployments in the following combination of digital displays to
augment the customer experience and deliver digital advertising over the life of the agreement.
•

(450) 55” Outdoor LCD displays

•

(90) 75” Free-standing, interactive, double-sided LCD kiosks

•

(45) LED displays/walls

From L to R: Examples of LCD displays, interactive LCD kiosks, and LED walls
These digital deployments are scheduled to be installed in a phased approach.

Packet Pg. 5

2.11.A

In the first three years (2022, 2023 and 2024), 300 displays, 60 kiosks and 30 LED walls are scheduled
for deployment totaling 390 digital signs.
An additional 50 displays, 10 kiosks and 5 LED walls are scheduled for deployment in 2032, 2034 and
2037 respectively, bringing the overall total to 585 digital signs across RTD’s system.

For each digital deployment, Lamar will propose locations for displays, which RTD staff will review and
approve, deny or suggest alternative solutions for each installation on a case-by-case basis.
RTD will have space on the digital displays to share real-time customer information and messages on an
ongoing basis. This space is up to 10% of the digital display rotation available for RTD use
(approximately 2.4 hours/day).
RTD will retain up to 20% reserve space on all vehicle exteriors, 50% of bus interior cards and 25% rail
card interiors [transfluxes] for RTD’s exclusive messaging use.
RTD will also have up to four static billboards available for its own messaging for the entire term of the
agreement.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The proposed agreement is a 10-year base contract with two, five-year options. Revenue for the base
term of the contract will total $63 million. The revenue share percentage is 70% to RTD over and
beyond the MAG.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Access-a-Cab Program

Committee Meeting Date:
June 15, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
June 15, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO, or her designee, to execute all
documents necessary to enter into a contract with Metro Taxi Inc., in order to continue providing a
subsidy for the Access-a-Cab program from July 1 through December 31, 2021 at an amount not to
exceed $705,000.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Ford, Chief Operations Officer
Paul Hamilton, Senior Manager, Paratransit Services
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 Minutes
BACKGROUND
In March 1997, the Regional Transportation District (RTD) introduced the Access-a-Cab program
to Access-a-Ride customers. The program offers flexibility in transportation services for
individuals with disabilities. Customers schedule same day trips with Metro Transportation. The
programs are interchangeable for certified eligible customers.
The service provided is not an RTD-branded transit service but rather taxi trips subsidized by
RTD. The current subsidy is $12 per trip.
The Access-a-Cab program is popular, providing 18% of all trips to Paratransit customers.
Expanding on the lessons learned from the ongoing Uber pilot will provide RTD time to develop a
more robust model and a Request for Proposals that allows for Non-Emergency Medical
Transportation, Taxi and transportation network companies to offer expanded customer options
when selecting an on-demand service alternatives.
DISCUSSION
The Access-a-Cab program is beneficial to RTD due to its smaller subsidy per ride when
compared to trips taken on the RTD-operated Access-a-Ride service. Trips taken by customers on
the Access-a-Ride service cost RTD an average of $60 per trip, as opposed to $12.
During the third and fourth quarters of 2021, Access-a-Cab is expected to provide approximately 58,750
cab trips at a total cost to RTD of $705,000. If those same trips were provided through Access-a-Ride,
the total cost to RTD would be approximately $3,525,000.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
2020 Annual Comprehensive Financial Report (ACFR)

Committee Meeting Date:
June 15, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
June 15, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt Regional Transportation District’s Annual Comprehensive Financial
Report, that includes audited financial reports relating to the year ended December 31, 2020.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
Byron Aten, Senior Manager of Accounting
BACKGROUND
Colorado state statutes require an annual financial audit be performed on the financial statements of
governmental agencies by independent certified public accountants. RTD is required to provide these
annual audited financial statements to the State of Colorado, external entities and other government
organizations to be in full compliance with legal covenants, debt agreements and other contractual
agreements. The accounting firm of Plante Moran, PLLC performed the financial audit of RTD’s financial
statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2020.
In addition to the financial statement audit requirements set forth in state statutes, the audit also was
designed to fulfill the requirements of the federal Single Audit Act of 1984. A Single Audit is required
by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to review the expenditures of federal grant awards.
DISCUSSION
As stated in Plante Moran’s unmodified opinion, the financial statements in the enclosed Annual
Comprehensive Financial Report (ACFR) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
RTD as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flow for the
2020 and 2019 fiscal years in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact from this Recommended Action.

Regional Transportation District

May 27, 2021

State law requires that all general-purpose local governments publish within seven months of the
close of each fiscal year a complete set of financial statements presented in conformance with
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and audited in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards by a firm of licensed certified public accountants. Pursuant to that
requirement, the Annual Comprehensive Financial Report of the Regional Transportation District
(RTD) for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, is hereby issued.
This report consists of management’s representations concerning the finances of RTD.
Consequently, management assumes full responsibility for the completeness and reliability of all
of the information presented in this report. To provide a reasonable basis for making these
representations, management has established a comprehensive internal control framework that is
designed both to protect the government’s assets from loss, theft, or misuse and to compile
sufficient, reliable information for the preparation of RTD’s financial statements in conformity with
GAAP. The cost of internal controls should not outweigh the benefits, RTD’s comprehensive
framework of internal controls has been designed to provide reasonable rather than absolute
assurance that the financial statements will be free from material misstatement. As the General
Manager and CEO, I assert that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, this financial report is
complete and reliable in all material respects.
RTD’s financial statements have been audited by Plante & Moran, PLLC, a firm of licensed certified
public accountants. The goal of the independent audit was to provide reasonable assurance that
the financial statements of RTD for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, are free of material
misstatement. The independent audit involved examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements; assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management; and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. The independent auditor concluded, based upon the audit, that there was a
reasonable basis for rendering an unmodified opinion that RTD’s financial statements for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2020, are fairly presented in conformity with GAAP. The independent
auditor’s report is presented as the first component of the Financial Section of this report.
The independent audit of the financial statements of RTD was part of a broader, federally
mandated “Single Audit” designed to meet the special needs of federal grantor agencies. The
standards governing Single Audit engagements require the independent auditor to report not only
on the fair presentation of the financial statements, but also on the audited government’s internal
controls and compliance with legal requirements, with special emphasis on internal controls and
legal requirements involving the administration of federal awards. These reports are in RTD’s
separately issued Single Audit Report.
GAAP requires that management provide a narrative introduction, overview, and analysis to
accompany the basic financial statements in the form of Management’s Discussion and Analysis

(MD&A). This letter of transmittal is designed to complement the MD&A and should be read in
conjunction with it. RTD’s MD&A can be found immediately following the report of the
independent auditors.

RTD provides public mass transit service to the Denver metropolitan area. In 1969, the Colorado
General Assembly (Assembly) found that public transit was a necessary part of the growing
Denver Metropolitan Region. The Assembly found that public sector involvement was the best
method to ensure the continuation of this vital component. Thus, RTD was created as a political
subdivision of the State effective July 1969 “to develop, maintain, and operate a public mass
transportation system for the benefit of the District.”
RTD boundaries now include Jefferson, Boulder, and Denver counties, most of the City and County
of Broomfield, and portions of Adams, Douglas, Weld, and Arapahoe counties. Over 3.09 million
people reside within RTD’s 2,342 square mile service area.
Since 1983, RTD has had a 15-member Board of Directors that are elected by their constituents
to serve four-year terms to govern RTD. There are approximately 205,000 residents per director
district. The RTD Board of Directors is responsible for setting policy, overseeing the agency’s
annual budget, and establishing short and long-range transit goals and plans in concert with local,
state, and federal agencies.
In 2020, RTD employed 2,986 people, making it one of the largest employers in the eight county
area. In addition, RTD contracts with private carriers to provide paratransit service branded
“Access-a-Ride”, fixed route and commuter rail services employing 1,608 individuals. Besides its
administrative headquarters in Denver, RTD has seven operating facilities (excluding purchased
transportation services), including four in Denver, one in Aurora, one in Englewood, and one in
Boulder.
The financial reporting entity includes all of the financial activities of RTD, as well as those
activities of its component unit, the Asset Acquisition Authority, Inc. (the Authority), a nonprofit
corporation established to facilitate RTD’s use of lease/purchase financing. In addition, the
financial reporting entity also includes activities of the RTD Salaried Pension Plan and RTD Salaried
Employee 401(a) Plan for which there is a fiduciary relationship.
RTD also maintains budgetary controls. These controls ensure compliance with legal provisions
embodied in the annual appropriated budget approved by RTD’s Board of Directors. The budget
sets forth proposed outlays for operations, planning, administration, development, debt service,
and capital assets. The level of budgetary control (that is, the level at which expenditures cannot
legally exceed the appropriated amount) is established at the project level.
The annual budget serves as the foundation for RTD’s financial planning and control. All
departments of RTD are required to submit requests for appropriation to the General Manager
and CEO on or before August 1st of each year. The General Manager and CEO uses these requests
as the starting point for developing a proposed budget. The General Manager and CEO then
presents this proposed budget to the Board of Directors for review prior to October 15th. The
Board of Directors is required to hold a public hearing on the proposed budget and to adopt a
final budget no later than December 31st.

Unused appropriations lapse at year-end, except that the Board of Directors has the authority, as
stated in the adopted appropriation resolution, to carry-over the unused portion of the funds for
capital projects not completed, for a period not to exceed three years.
RTD’s policy also authorizes the General Manager and CEO to approve certain line-item transfers
within the budget. Budget-to-actual comparisons are provided in the Supplemental Information
Section of this report.

The information presented in the financial statements is perhaps best understood when it is
considered in the broader perspective of the specific environment within which RTD operates.
RTD serves the eight-county region considered the Denver metropolitan area. It is the most
populated area of the state and the economic barometer of Colorado. Employment in the Denver
Metro area is dominated by small businesses. These companies represent a diverse mix of
industries and are located throughout the Denver metropolitan area, providing a geographic
balance in employment centers.
The Colorado Legislative Council (CLC) in its March 2021 report forecasts that the outlook for the
economy continues to improve as the population immunized against the COVID-19 virus grow
daily and business and consumer confidence increases. The approval of federal stimulus packages
also favorably affects the forecasts. At the same time, this economic optimism is dampened by
concerns surrounding the lasting effects of the Pandemic, its disproportionate impact on those
with low incomes and its impact on Colorado’s leisure and hospitality sectors.
Economists for CLC reported the following key economic indicators:

On November 3, 1992, the voters of Colorado approved a constitutional amendment known as
the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights (TABOR), hereinafter referred to as the Amendment, that limits taxes,
revenue, and spending for state and local governments effective December 31, 1992. On
November 7, 1995, the voters of the District exempted RTD from the revenue and spending
limitations concerning the Amendment through December 31, 2005. On November 2, 1999, the
voters of the District further exempted RTD from the revenue and spending limitations outlined
in the Amendment for the purpose of paying any debt incurred to finance the construction of the
Southeast and Southwest light rail lines or to operate such for as long as any debt remains
outstanding, but in no event beyond December 31, 2026.
On November 2, 2004, the voters of the District authorized an increase in the District’s sales and
use tax rate from 0.6% to 1.0%, effective January 1, 2005, to finance the FasTracks transit
improvement program. This authorization also exempted the District from any revenue and

Factors Affecting Financial Condition

2.11.C.b

spending limitations under TABOR on the additional tax and on investment income generated by
the increased tax revenue and allowed RTD to incur debt to finance the capital improvements
included in the FasTracks program. At the time that all FasTracks debt is repaid, the District’s
sales and use tax rate will be reduced to a rate sufficient to operate the transit system financed
through FasTracks and the TABOR restriction exemption will expire.

Each year the Board of Directors adopts a financially balanced Mid-Term Financial Plan (MTFP),
which is the six-year operating and capital improvement plan for RTD including both the Base
System and FasTracks. This plan was previously made up of two separate components known
as the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) for the Base System and the Annual Program Evaluation (APE)
for FasTracks. The MTFP is a component of the long-term transportation planning program for
the Denver metropolitan area evaluated by the Denver Regional Council of Governments
(DRCOG). While the MTFP is developed separately for the Base System and FasTracks, RTD
integrates both plans into a single medium and long-range Financial Plan which includes the
entirety of RTD in a single report. This financial information forms the basis for the development
of RTD’s annual budget. In November 2020, the Board of Directors approved only years 2021
and 2022 of the 2021-2026 MTFP due to the financial volatility and uncertainty as a result of the
effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic.
Long-term financial planning seeks to allocate resources among related and, at times, competing
activities and to optimize those resources in a manner consistent with defined organizational goals
and objectives.
FINANCIAL INFORMATION
RTD management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an internal control structure
designed to ensure that assets are protected from loss, theft, or misuse and that adequate
accounting data are compiled to allow for the preparation of financial statements in conformity
with GAAP. RTD has designed its internal control structure to provide reasonable, but not
absolute, assurance that these objectives are met. The concept of reasonable assurance
recognizes that: (1) the costs of a control should not exceed the benefits likely to be derived and
(2) the valuation of costs and benefits requires estimates and judgment by management.
Single Audit: As a recipient of federal assistance, RTD is responsible for ensuring that an
adequate internal control structure is instituted to ensure compliance with applicable laws and
regulations related to those programs. This internal control structure is subject to periodic
evaluation by management and the RTD internal audit staff.
As part of RTD’s single audit, tests are made to determine the adequacy of the internal control
structure, including that portion related to federal financial assistance programs, as well as to
evaluate RTD’s compliance. RTD’s single audit for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 found
no instances of material weakness in the internal control structures or significant violations of
applicable laws and regulations. A separate report was prepared for this purpose.
Fiscal Policy: RTD follows a fiscal policy approved by the Board of Directors annually or as
necessary due to modification. The fiscal policy contains policies for revenue, investments,
expenditures, capital improvements, fund balance, debt, budgeting, accounting and grants.

Long-term Financial Planning

2.11.C.b

Cash Management: The main objective of RTD’s cash management program is the protection
of investment principal while providing optimal levels of cash throughout the year. The RTD
investment policy is modified periodically to adapt to changes in eligible investments, benchmarks,
and specific objectives.
During the year, RTD invested its cash in various investment vehicles including money market funds,
U.S. Treasury securities, agency securities, discount notes, commercial paper, repurchase
agreements, and variable and fixed rate mortgage-backed securities. The total average return on
investments for the year was 1.2%.
Risk Management: RTD employs a combination of self-insurance and purchased insurance in
its efforts to protect assets and control and prevent losses.
The areas of self-insurance are worker’s compensation, automobile and general liability. RTD is
self-insured for liability, the limits of which are $387,000 per person and $1,093,000 per
occurrence as specified under the Colorado Governmental Immunity statute. The self-insured
retention for worker’s compensation claims is $2,000,000 per claim, with any amounts above this
covered by purchased insurance up to the legal limits of liability under the Colorado worker’s
compensation statute.
Commercial insurance policies provide coverage including: property coverage up to $500,000,000
for buildings, their contents, and rolling stock (other than collision); a Commercial Crime Policy
with a limit of $10,000,000; a $5,000 bond for CDL Testing Performance Bond; $2,600,000
Workers’ Compensation Bond; Felonious Assault Policy; travel insurance for employees on RTD
business; fiduciary coverage on the Trustees of the Union Pension Trust, Salaried Pension Trust,
Represented Health and Welfare Union Trust, Legal Trust, and the employees administering the
health benefits program for salaried employees with a limit of $8,000,000; Cyber Liability policy
with a limit of $10,000,000; Drone policy with a limit of $10,000,000. With the growth of
Commuter Rail Transit (CRT) services, RTD has added Railroad Protective and Railroad Liability
commercial insurance policies that provide coverage when required under operational needs.
OTHER INFORMATION
Independent Audit: State statutes require an annual audit by independent certified public
accountants. The accounting firm of Plante & Moran, PLLC was selected to perform the 2020
audit. This audit also was designated to meet the requirements of the Federal Single Audit 2 CFR
200.501, Uniform Grant Guidance and related 2 CFR 200, Uniform Grant Guidance – Uniform
Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles and Audit Requirements. The auditor’s report on the
financial statements and schedules are included in the Financial Section of this report. The
auditor’s report related specifically to the single audit is included in a separate report.

Packet Pg. 33

Attachment: ACFR 2020 (4527 : 2020 Annual Comprehensive Financial Report (ACFR))

Debt Administration: RTD formulates its debt policy to protect its credit ratings and soundly
manage its assets and liabilities. Included in this policy is a requirement that debt will not be
used to finance current operations. Another requirement precludes financing capital projects
beyond the useful life of the project. Additional policies go beyond these essential guidelines and
result in further protection. RTD has separate ratings for its 1.0% sales and use taxes. Base
System bonds secured by the 0.6% sales tax are rated by Moody’s Investors Service as “Aa1”, by
Standard and Poor’s Corporation as “AAA” and by Fitch Ratings as “AA”. FasTracks Bonds that
are secured by the 0.4% sales tax are rated by Moody’s Investors Service as “Aa2”, by Standard
and Poor’s Corporation as “AA+” and by Fitch Ratings as “AA”.

2.11.C.b

Awards: The Government Finance Officers Associations (GFOA) awarded a Certificate of
Achievement for Excellence in Financial Reporting to RTD for its Annual Comprehensive Financial
Report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. This is the twenty-eighth consecutive year
that RTD has been awarded this prestigious award.

The Certificate of Achievement is valid for one year only. It is my belief the current Annual
Comprehensive Financial Report meets the program’s requirements and will be submitting it to
the GFOA to determine its eligibility for another certificate.
Acknowledgements: Timely preparation of the Annual Comprehensive Financial Report was
made possible by the dedicated services of the Finance Department led by Doug MacLeod, Chief
Financial Officer. I extend my sincere appreciation to each of them for their contributions.
Moreover, I thank the Board of Directors for its continued support and leadership.

Sincerely,

Debra A. Johnson

Independent Auditor's Report
To the Board of Directors
Regional Transportation District

We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the enterprise fund and aggregate fiduciary funds of
the Regional Transportation District (the "District") as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020; the Section
401(a) Retirement Plan as of December 31, 2019; and the related notes to the financial statements, which
collectively comprise the Regional Transportation District's basic financial statements, as listed in the table of
contents.
Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes the design,
implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements based on our audit. We did not audit the
financial statements of the Salaried Pension Plan, a fiduciary fund of the District, for the years ended December
31, 2020 and 2019, which represents 78.1 percent, 78.1 percent, and 58.1 percent of the assets, net position,
and revenue of the fiduciary funds, respectively, for 2020 and 81.1 percent, 81.1 percent, and 71.1 percent,
respectively, for 2019. Those financial statements were audited by other auditors whose report has been furnished
to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for the Salaried Pension Plan, is based solely
on the report of the other auditors.
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America
and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the
Comptroller General of the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. The financial
statements of the Salaried Employees Pension Plan were not audited in accordance with Government Auditing
Standards.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk
assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the
financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. Accordingly, we express no
such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit
opinions.

Report on the Financial Statements

2.11.C.b
To the Board of Directors
Regional Transportation District
Opinions

Emphasis of Matter
As described in Note A to the basic financial statements, in 2020, the District adopted the provisions of
Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Statement No. 84, Fiduciary Activities, which established
accounting and financial report standards for the identification and reporting of fiduciary activities. Our opinion
is not modified with respect to this matter.
Other Matters
Report on Prior Year Financial Statements
The basic financial statements of the enterprise fund of the Regional Transportation District as of and for the
year ended December 31, 2019 were audited by a predecessor auditor, which expressed an unmodified opinion
on the enterprise fund. The predecessor auditor's report was dated June 3, 2020.
Required Supplemental Information
Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that the management's
discussion and analysis and required supplemental information, as identified in the table of contents, be
presented to supplement the basic financial statements. Such information, although not a part of the basic
financial statements, is required by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board, which considers it to be an
essential part of financial reporting for placing the basic financial statements in an appropriate operational,
economic, or historical context. We have applied certain limited procedures to the required supplemental
information in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which
consisted of inquiries of management about the methods of preparing the information and comparing the
information for consistency with management's responses to our inquiries, the basic financial statements, and
other knowledge we obtained during our audit of the basic financial statements. We do not express an opinion
or provide any assurance on the information because the limited procedures do not provide us with sufficient
evidence to express an opinion or provide any assurance.
Other Information
Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the financial statements that collectively
comprise the Regional Transportation District's basic financial statements. The supplemental information, as
identified in the table of contents, and introductory and statistical sections are presented for the purpose of
additional analysis and are not a required part of the basic financial statements.
The supplemental information is the responsibility of management and was derived from and relates directly to
the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements. Such information
has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements and certain
additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying
accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements or to the basic financial statements
themselves, and other additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the
United States of America. In our opinion, the supplemental information is fairly stated in all material respects in
relation to the basic financial statements as a whole.

In our opinion, based on our audit and the report of other auditors, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the respective financial position of the enterprise fund and aggregate
fiduciary funds of the Regional Transportation District as of December 31, 2020 and the Section 401(a)
Retirement Plan as of December 31, 2019 and the respective changes in its financial position and, where
applicable, cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America.

2.11.C.b
To the Board of Directors
Regional Transportation District
The introductory and statistical sections have not been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit
of the basic financial statements, and, accordingly, we do not express an opinion or provide any assurance on
them.

In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report dated May 27, 2021 on
our consideration of the Regional Transportation District's internal control over financial reporting and on our
tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, grant agreements, and other
matters. The purpose of that report is to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial
reporting and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the internal control
over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance
with Government Auditing Standards in considering the Regional Transportation District's internal control over
financial reporting and compliance.

Key Reporting Implementations
In fiscal year 2020, RTD implemented Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) pronouncement
84 Fiduciary Activities. GASB 84 establishes criteria for identifying fiduciary activities for state and local
governments. The focus of criteria is generally on whether the government is controlling the assets of the
fiduciary activity and the beneficiaries with whom a fiduciary relationship exists. As such, RTD has included
the financial activities of the RTD Salaried Pension Plan and RTD 401(a) retirement plan in its financial
statements.
Financial Highlights
In December 2019, a novel strain of the coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19, emerged. The virus
subsequently spread globally resulting in a worldwide pandemic and caused significant disruptions to the
economy in 2020. The State of Colorado and several governmental entities within the District implemented
various safety measures including directives for social distancing and stay-at-home orders to mitigate the
spread of COVID-19. The Governor of Colorado issued the first statewide stay at home order for nonessential businesses on March 25, 2020. Additional safety protocols were enacted throughout 2020. As a
result of COVID-19, RTD experienced a significant reduction in ridership, fare revenues and its largest source
of revenues, sales and use taxes. Beginning in April 2020, RTD began implementing several cost saving
measures culminating in more severe reductions contemplated in the 2021 Budget. RTD continues to
monitor the effects of COVID-19 on transit and will make the necessary adjustments to adapt its services
and expenditures to available resources.
In March 2020, RTD was awarded $232,254 in federal COVID-19 relief grant funding through the
Coronavirus, Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act to maintain transit operations. The CARES Act
funding was fully drawn by RTD during 2020. In January 2021, RTD was notified of an additional federal
COVID-19 relief grant apportionment through the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental
Appropriations Act (CRRSAA) of $203,368. Furthermore, in March 2021, RTD was notified of another federal
COVID-19 relief grant apportionment through the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) of $338,468. For each
of these three COVID-19 relief grant apportionments, RTD has and will apply the funding to maintain transit
operations.
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, total assets and deferred outflows of resources of RTD exceeded total
liabilities and deferred inflows of resources by $3,361,993 and $3,336,878, respectively. The amount of
unrestricted net position as of December 31, 2020 was $1,165 compared to a deficit of $165,410 in 2019.
RTD’s 2020 unrestricted net position was positively impacted by expenditure reduction efforts in response
to the impact of COVID-19 as well as additional federal COVID-19 relief funding.

The management of the Regional Transportation District (RTD) offers users of our financial statements this
narrative overview and analysis of the financial activities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
This discussion and analysis is designed to assist the reader to focus on significant financial activities and
identify any significant changes in the financial position of RTD. It should be read in conjunction with the
financial statements that follow this section. All amounts, unless otherwise indicated, are expressed in
thousands of dollars.

2.11.C.b

RTD experienced an approximate 60% decrease in ridership due to COVID-19 beginning in March 2020
which negatively affected fare revenues. Fare revenue is a significant source of funding for RTD.
RTD’s sales and use tax revenues are its largest single source of revenues. These tax revenues were
negatively impacted by the economic effects of COVID-19.
For 2020, total operating expenses exceeded total revenues resulting in a loss before non-operating revenue
and expenses of $869,060 compared to a loss of $837,088 for 2019. The increase in operating loss for 2020
was primarily due to a reduction in fare revenue from significant decreases in ridership and lower sales and
use tax revenues due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. RTD anticipates operating losses each year, as these
losses are subsidized by non-operating sales and use tax, grant revenues and other miscellaneous income.
RTD’s total debt decreased $83,422 (2.2%) and decreased $69,194 (2.0%) in 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Outstanding debt decreased in 2020 and 2019 due to payment of outstanding principal balances.
Capital grants and local contributions decreased $28,320 (22.7%) in 2020 and increased 43,495 (53.4%)
in the previous year. The decrease in 2020 was a result of lower capital grant eligible expenditures as the
FasTracks capital expansion project winds down. The increase in 2019 was a result of additional grant draws
on the FasTracks Eagle P3 project.
Grant operating assistance increased $230,585 (267.3%) in 2020 as a result of receiving $232,254 from
the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act. Grant operating assistance decreased $140
(0.1%) in 2019 due to a small change in RTD’s federal appropriation.
RTD’s capital assets, net of depreciation, decreased $241,786 (3.5%) in 2020 and increased $297,820
(3.3%) in 2019. The decrease in 2020 was due to a reduction in capital additions as large expansion projects
were placed in revenue service during the year and systematic depreciation was applied. The increase in
2019 occurred as capital expansion projects were continuing to be constructed.
Basic Financial Statements
Management’s Discussion and Analysis serves as an introduction to RTD’s basic financial statements. RTD’s
financial statements are prepared using proprietary fund (enterprise fund) accounting that uses a similar
basis of accounting as private-sector business enterprises. Under this method of accounting, an economic
resources measurement focus and an accrual basis of accounting is used. Revenue is recorded when earned
and expenses are recorded when incurred.

The net position of RTD increased by $25,115 (0.8%) during the current year compared to a decrease of
$126,628 (3.7%) in the previous year. The increase in 2020 was primarily due to the aforementioned cost
reductions and federal funding in response to the COVID-19 Pandemic. The decrease for 2019 was due to
additional depreciation on assets that were placed in service during 2019 and 2018 due to the opening of
additional rail lines as well as expensing interest costs on the Eagle P3 project that had previously been
recorded as prepaid items.

2.11.C.b

The statements of net position presents information on assets and deferred outflows of resources and
liabilities and deferred inflows of resources, with the difference between the two reported as the net
position. Over time, increases or decreases in net position may serve as a useful indicator of whether the
financial position of RTD is improving or deteriorating. The statements of revenues, expenses, and changes
in net position presents information on operating revenues and expenses and non-operating revenues and
expenses of RTD for the fiscal year with the difference, the net income or loss, combined with any capital
grants and local contributions to determine the change in net position for the year. That change combined
with the previous year-end total net position reconciles to the net position total at the end of the current
fiscal year. All changes in net position are reported as soon as the underlying event giving rise to the
changes occurs, regardless of the timing of the related cash flows.
The statements of cash flows reports cash and cash equivalent activities for the fiscal year resulting from
operating activities, capital, and related financing activities, noncapital and related financing activities and
investing activities. The result of these activities added to the beginning of the year cash balance reconciles
to the cash and cash equivalents balance at the end of the current fiscal year. The statements of cash
flows, along with the related notes and information in other financial statements, can be used to assess the
following: RTD’s ability to generate positive cash flows and pay its debt as the debt matures; the reasons
for differences between RTD’s operating cash flows and operating income (loss); and the effect of investing,
capital, and financing activities on RTD’s financial position.
The notes to the financial statements provide additional information that is essential to fully understand the
data provided in the statements of net position, statements of revenues, expenses, and changes in net
position, and statements of cash flows.
RTD provides bus, paratransit, light rail and commuter rail service in a 2,342 square mile area (District) in
and around Denver, Colorado. The activities of RTD are supported by a 0.6% and 0.4% sales and use tax
collected within the District. The 0.6% sales and use tax is used to fund the Base System operations of
RTD. The Base System operations provide the bus and the majority of current light rail services in the
Denver area. The 0.4% sales and use tax funds the FasTracks build-out program and operation and
maintenance of those program elements as well as providing for enhanced transit services in the District.
Additional revenue sources include fare collections, federal, state, and local financial assistance, investment
income, and other income such as advertising and rental income.

In 2020, current assets increased by $121,288 (15.4%) primarily due to an increase in cash as federal
COVID-19 relief was provided and RTD drew 2020 grant apportionments during the fiscal year.
In 2020, capital assets net of accumulated depreciation decreased $241,786 (3.5%) primarily due to the
completion and activation of the final rail corridors in the FasTracks program. The decrease resulted from
additional depreciation from assets that were placed in service.
Total liabilities and deferred inflows decreased $175,437 (4.1%) in 2020 primarily due to debt service
payments reducing outstanding obligations as well as favorable investment returns in pension funds which
have reduced projected retirement obligations.
The net position of RTD increased by $25,115 (0.8%) during the current year compared to a decrease of
$126,628 (3.7%) in the previous year. The increase in 2020 was primarily due to the aforementioned cost

Passenger fares – Passenger fares provided 6.6% and 14.4% of total revenues in 2020 and 2019,
respectively. Farebox receipts, monthly and annual pass revenue, and special event fares for bus and rail
services are included in passenger fares. Passenger fares decreased by $78,125 (50.6%) in 2020 compared
to an increase of $11,159 (7.8%) in 2019. Passenger fare changes in 2020 were due to an approximate
60% loss of ridership due to COVID-19. The increase in 2019 was due to the opening of the G Line
commuter rail corridor.
Advertising and other – Advertising and other revenue provided 0.5% and 0.6% of total revenues in
2020 and 2019. This revenue category primarily includes revenues from advertisements on RTD’s buses
and external wraps on light rail vehicles as well as revenue from naming rights. Advertising and other
income decreased $370 (5.6%) in 2020 compared to a decrease of $982 (13.0%) in 2019. The decreases
in both years were primarily due to lower advertising revenues from lower advertisement sales.
Sales and Use Tax – Sales and use tax provided 55.2% and 61.3% of RTD’s total revenues in 2020 and
2019, respectively. Sales and use tax is a dedicated 1.0% tax imposed on certain sales within the District.
Sales and use tax decreased $26,753 (4.1%) in 2020 compared to an increase of $25,226 (4.0%) in 2019.
The decrease in 2020 was due to the negative economic impacts of COVID-19. In 2019, the District
experienced growth in tax revenues due to increased consumer and business-spending activity as the area
continued to experience population growth, low unemployment as well as growth in personal income.
Grant operating assistance – Grant operating assistance provided 27.6% and 8.0% of total revenues in
2020 and 2019. Grant operating assistance increased $230,585 (267.3%) in 2020 compared to a decrease
of $140 (0.2%) in 2019. The operating assistance is a federal grant revenue program used to perform
capital maintenance and maintain RTD’s revenue fleet of bus, paratransit, and rail vehicles. The revenue
increase in 2020 was the result of federal COVID-19 relief grant funding from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief
and Economic Security (CARES) Act of $232,254 to maintain certain operating levels in order to serve
ongoing public transit needs.

Other Income/Gain on sale of Assets – Other income provided 0.9% and 2.5% of total revenues in
2020 and 2019. Other income decreased $16,185 (60.9%) in 2020 compared to an increase of $13,964
(110.7%) in 2019. Other income includes interest subsidy income, rental income from retail space, parking,
and miscellaneous other items. The decrease in 2020 was primarily due to having no realized one-time
gains such as those that occurred in 2019. The increase in 2019 was primarily due to insurance refunds
and other miscellaneous items.
Capital grants and local contributions – Capital grants and local contributions provided 8.4% and
11.6% of total revenues in 2020 and 2019. Capital grants and local contributions decreased $28,320
(22.7%) in 2020 and increased $43,495 (53.7%) in 2019. The decrease in 2020 resulted from lower
infrastructure expenditures due to completion of the FasTracks G commuter rail line which was funded, in
part, with federal funding. The increase in 2019 was due to grant draws on the FasTracks project elements
that were under construction or reached final completion during the year.

Salaries and wages – Salary and wage expense is one of the largest expense categories accounting for
17.3% and 16.3% of the total RTD expenses in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Salary and wage expenses
decreased by $2,098 (1.1%) in 2020 compared to an increase of $12,606 (6.9%) in 2019. The decrease
in 2020 was due to expense reductions initiated due to COVID-19 impacts to revenue while the increase in
2019 occurred from salary and wage performance and progression increases, and additional service
provided with the openings of new FasTracks rail corridors.
Benefits – Fringe benefits accounted for 4.8% and 4.5% of total expenses in 2020 and 2019. Fringe
benefits decreased by $381 (0.7%) in 2020 compared to an increase of $1,576 (3.0%) in 2019. The
decrease in 2020 was due to a decrease in compensation resulting from expense reduction efforts in
response to COVID-19 as well as recognition of lower pension liabilities due to favorable pension investment
returns. The increase in 2019 was largely due to an increase in health and welfare benefit rates.

Services – Services expense accounted for 7.5% and 8.0% of total expenses in 2020 and 2019. Services
expense includes contracted services such as security services, vehicle, equipment and right of way
maintenance services, advertising and marketing services, and legal services. Services expense decreased
$11,412 (11.9%) in 2020 compared to an increase of $14,896 (18.3%) in 2019. The decrease in 2020
resulted from service expense reductions to adjust to lower revenues caused by the COVID-19 economic
effects. The increase in 2019 was due to increased contractual increases and additional security services
due to opening of new rail lines.
Utilities – Utilities accounted for 1.4% and 1.5% of total expenses in 2020 and 2019. Utilities expense
includes electric, telecommunications, water and sewer, and natural gas for facilities as well as traction
power for rail lines. Utilities expense decreased $1,617 (9.1%) in 2020 compared to an increase of $1,404
(8.6%) in 2019. The decrease in 2020 resulted from a decrease in rail service and the associated electric
power as a result of service reductions for COVID-19. The increase in 2019 occurred primarily due to
traction power cost increases from the opening of the G Line commuter rail corridor.
Insurance – Insurance accounted for 0.9% and 0.9% of total expenses in 2020 and 2019. Insurance
expense includes RTD’s self-insured cost for general liability and worker’s compensation claims as well as
the premium cost for excess insurance lines and railroad liability insurance. In addition, RTD purchased
insurance for cybersecurity needs. Insurance expense decreased $647 (6.0%) in 2020 compared to a
decrease of $892 (9.0%) in 2019. The decreases in both years was due to lower frequency and severity of
claims as RTD has focused additional cost containment efforts in this area.
Purchased transportation – The purchased transportation expense category accounted for 18.2% and
16.9% of the total expenses in 2020 and 2019. Purchased transportation represents the costs of contracted
transportation services for bus, commuter rail, Access-a-Ride, and FlexRide services. Purchased
transportation costs increased $405 (0.2%) in 2020 compared to an increase of $27,143 (15.4%) in 2019.
The increase in 2020 was due to additional rail corridors being opened of which the increased costs were
partially offset by service reductions and in 2019 the increase was due to additional rail corridors being
opened.
Leases and rentals – Leases and rentals include lease expense for office space, office equipment, Parkn-Ride facilities, and use of communication towers and accounted for 0.3% and 0.3% of total expenses in
2020 and 2019, respectively. Leases and rentals expense increased $193 (6.0%) in 2020 compared to an
increase of $1,208 (60.5%) in 2019. The increase in 2020 was due to contractual increases as well as the
minor addition of certain facilities to accommodate the new rail corridors. The increase in 2019 was due to
additional leased office space for the N Line commuter rail operation startup.
Miscellaneous – Miscellaneous expense includes other incidental operating expenses not included in other
defined categories and accounted for 0.2% and 0.4% of total expenses in 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Materials and supplies – The materials and supplies expense category accounted for 3.8% and 4.6% of
the total expenses in 2020 and 2019 respectively. Materials and supplies expenses decreased $12,875
(23.4%) in 2020 compared to an increase of $3,648 (7.1%) in 2019. The decrease in 2020 resulted after
prior years saw increases as materials and supplies were increased for the opening of new rail lines in
addition to reduced uses of consumable materials such as fuel and parts resulting from COVID-19 expense
reduction efforts.

2.11.C.b

Depreciation – The depreciation expense category accounted for 30.3% and 29.6% of the total expenses
in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Depreciation expense is a non-cash systematic allocation of the cost of
capital assets over the estimated useful life of the assets. Depreciation expense decreased $15,584 (4.4%)
in 2020 compared to an increase of $69,764 (14.9%) in 2019. The increase beginning in 2019 was primarily
related to placement in service of the majority of the FasTracks Project infrastructure for rail corridors.
Interest expense – The interest expense category accounted for 14.9% and 16.7% of the total expenses
in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Interest expense decreased $33,790 (16.8%) in 2020 compared to an
increase of $138,075 (24.4%) in 2019. The increase in 2019 was an anomaly due to Eagle P3 Project catchup recognition of interest expense due to the project reaching final completion.
Other expense – Other expense includes miscellaneous non-operating expenses not classified in other
expense categories and accounted for 0.3% and 0.1% in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Other expense
increased $698 (22.3%) in 2020 compared to an increase of $1,659 (113.2%) in 2019. The decrease in
2020 was due to no miscellaneous non-operating costs being incurred. The increase in cost for 2019 was
due to retirement of capital assets resulting in a loss.
Capital Assets – Investments in capital assets include land and right-of-way, buildings and improvements,
leasehold improvements, revenue and non-revenue vehicles, shop and service equipment, security and
surveillance equipment, computer equipment, and furniture. RTD’s investment in capital assets, net of
accumulated depreciation in 2020 was $6,600,057 compared to $6,841,843 in 2019. The decrease in capital
assets in 2020 was $241,786 (3.5%) compared to a decrease of $9,362 (0.1%) in 2019. The decrease in
2020 was due to additional accumulated depreciation after assets were placed in service with the opening
of new rail corridors. The decrease in 2019 was due primarily to retirement of capital assets, primarily
revenue earning equipment and additional depreciation of assets placed in service with new rail corridors.

Outstanding debt – Outstanding debt includes sales tax revenue bonds, a Transportation Infrastructure
and Innovation Act (TIFIA) loan, certificates of participation, and a purchase and assignment agreement.
The 2020 outstanding debt was $3,299,887 compared to $3,383,309 in 2019. Outstanding debt decreased
by $83,422 (2.5%) in 2020 and decreased by $69,194 (2.0%) in 2019. The decrease in 2020 and 2019
was due to payment of principal on outstanding debt.
Sales tax revenue bonds – RTD issues sales tax revenue bonds to fund the acquisition and construction
of assets. These bonds are secured by future sales and use tax revenues. The sales tax revenue bonds
were $2,062,918 and $2,067,664 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The sales tax revenue
bonds decreased $4,746 (0.2%) in 2020 compared to a decrease of $4,825 (0.2%) in 2019. The decrease
in 2020 and 2019 was due to payment of principal on outstanding debt.
Certificates of participation - Certificates of participation (Certificates) relate to financial obligations
issued by the Asset Acquisition Authority, Inc. (Authority), a nonprofit corporation and component unit of
RTD. Certificates are lease-purchase financial obligations secured by the underlying assets. Outstanding
Certificates were issued with the proceeds being used to acquire certain equipment, facilities and
infrastructure to be used by RTD. For financial reporting purposes, RTD accounts for the Certificates as
its own debt. Certificates outstanding were $1,011,319 and $1,089,312 as of December 31, 2020 and
2019, respectively. The Certificates outstanding decreased $77,993 (7.2%) in 2020 compared to a
decrease of $48,620 (4.3%) in 2019. The decrease in 2020 and 2019 is due to payment of outstanding
principal.
RTD maintains credit ratings from Standard & Poor Corporation, Moody’s Investor Services, and Fitch
Ratings. Credit ratings vary based on the type of debt and the source of funds used for repayment.

Economic Factors and Subsequent Events after adoption of the 2020 Budget
RTD is dependent on sales and use taxes, which are the largest single source of revenue for RTD,
representing 55.2% and 61.3% of the total revenues in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Sales and use tax
revenues are affected by the local economy in which changes will affect the level of funding available to
RTD during its fiscal year. RTD’s 2020 sales and use taxes decreased 4.1% in 2020 due to the economic
effects of COVID-19.
RTD is dependent on passenger fares collected for transit services that it provides. Passenger fares
accounted for 6.6% and 14.4% of total revenues in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Passenger fare collections
were significantly impacted by COVID-19 and lower ridership in 2020.
RTD is dependent on federal and local grant funding as well as local capital contributions for both operations
and capital expenditures. Grant operating assistance provided 27.6% and 8.0% of total revenues in 2020
and 2019, respectively with the increase in 2020 being attributable to federal COVID-19 relief funding to
replace lost revenues while maintaining public transit service.
Each year, RTD may propose an Amended Budget at any point to the Board of Directors for appropriation
in order to adjust revenue and expenditures for the remainder of the fiscal year according to existing
economic conditions and fiscal results. RTD may also present budget amendments to the Board of Directors
for approval at any time during the fiscal year to accommodate economic factors.
In 2020, RTD reached final completion on the remaining FasTracks Project elements for which funding had
been identified. Additional FasTracks elements approved by the voters of the District have been deferred
due to a lack of current identifiable funding.
Requests for Information
This financial report is intended to provide an overview of RTD’s finances for those with an interest in this
organization. Questions concerning any information contained in this report may be directed to the RTD

Notes to Financial Statements
December 31, 2020 and 2019 (Dollars in Thousands)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE A – SUM M AR Y OF SIGNI FI CANT ACCOUNTI NG P OLI CI ES
The Regional Transportation District (RTD) was created as a transportation planning agency,
a political subdivision of the State of Colorado, by an Act of the Colorado General Assembly
(the Act), effective July 1969 (Title 32, Article 9, C.R.S., 1973, as amended). In 1974, the
Act was amended and RTD became an operating entity charged with the responsibility for
development, operation and maintenance of a public mass transportation system for the
benefit of the citizens of the District. The District is comprised of 15 separate districts
located in Denver, Boulder, Broomfield and Jefferson counties, and certain portions of
Adams, Arapahoe, Douglas, and Weld counties.
RTD is governed by a publicly elected board of directors consisting of 15 members. Each
board member is elected to serve a term of four years by the constituents of the District in
which the board member resides. As required by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
(GAAP), these financial statements present RTD and its component units. The component
unit discussed in note A. 2. is included in RTD’s reporting entity because of the significance
its financial relationship with the RTD.
In 1988, a Senate Bill was enacted (privatization legislation) requiring RTD to implement by
March 31, 1989, a plan to competitively bid contracts for the provision of at least 20% of
RTD’s bus service by private contractors. In 1999, the Bill was amended requiring RTD to
increase this provision to at least 35% of fixed route bus service. In 2003, the Bill was
amended to require that at least 50% of RTD’s vehicular service be operated by private
transit companies. In May of 2007, the legislation was amended to provide for “a system
under which up to 58% of the District’s service” is provided by private contractors.
2. Financial Reporting Entities
Blended Component Unit
The Asset Acquisition Authority, Inc. (Authority) was formed in 1987 as a nonprofit
corporation on behalf of RTD for the purpose of issuing certificates of participation in a
public offering collateralized by an installment purchase agreement with RTD. RTD’s
General Manager appoints the Board of Directors of the Authority. The Authority serves as
a financing mechanism for various financing arrangements for RTD. RTD follows
Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) pronouncement 14 (GASB 14) and 61
(GASB 61) which provide guidance regarding the inclusion of component units in the primary
government’s financial statement presentation. The activity related to the underlying
financial obligations of the Authority has been included as a blended component unit in
RTD’s financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. No separately
audited financial statements are prepared for the Authority.
Fiduciary Funds
GASB 84 requires that funds held in a trustee or custodial capacity that meet certain criteria
be included in RTD’s financial statement presentation. Those criteria include the
governmental agency having control of the assets of the fiduciary activity and the existence
of a fiduciary relationship with the beneficiaries. RTD has determined that the RTD Salaried

December 31, 2020 and 2019 (Dollars in Thousands)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Pension Plan and RTD Salaried 401(a) Retirement Plan meet these fiduciary criteria and has
included the financial activity of each in 2020 in the financial statement section of this report.

The accounts of RTD are reported as a Proprietary Fund. Proprietary funds are accounted
for on the flow of economic resources measurement focus and use the accrual basis of
accounting which reports all assets, deferred outflows of resources, liabilities, deferred
inflows of resources, revenues, expenses, gains and losses. Revenue is recognized when
earned and expenses are recorded at the time liabilities are incurred. Proprietary funds
distinguish operating revenues and expenses from non-operating items. Operating
revenues and expenses generally result from providing services and producing and
delivering goods in connection with a proprietary fund’s principal ongoing operations. The
principal operating revenues of RTD are charges (fares) to customers for services. Operating
expenses include the cost of services, administrative expenses and asset depreciation. All
revenues and expenses not meeting this definition are reported as non-operating revenues
and expenses.
It is RTD’s policy to apply Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) in its
presentation of financial statements. When both restricted and unrestricted resources are
available for use, it is RTD’s policy to use restricted resources first, then unrestricted
resources as they are needed.
4. Cash and Cash Equivalents
RTD considers all highly liquid investments, both restricted and unrestricted, with an original
maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
5. Interest Bearing Investments
Investments with a maturity date, when purchased, of less than one year are carried at cost
or amortized cost which approximates fair value. Investments with a maturity date of more
than one year from the date of purchase are carried at fair value.
6. Inventories
Inventories consist primarily of materials and supplies used in the ordinary course of
operations. Materials and supplies are stated at cost using the first-in, first-out (FIFO)
method.

7. Other Current Assets
Certain payments to vendors reflect costs applicable to future accounting periods and are
recorded as prepaid items. Escrows are deposits held in the custody of a third party until a
certain condition has been met such as retainage for construction projects. At the time
projects are completed, escrows are generally applied toward the cost of the project or may
be forfeited upon breach of contract.

December 31, 2020 and 2019 (Dollars in Thousands)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Accounts receivable are stated at the amount management expects to collect from
outstanding balances. Management provides for probable uncollected amounts through a
charge to earnings and a credit to a valuation allowance based on its assessment of the
current status of individual accounts. Balances that are still outstanding after management
has used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the valuation
allowance and a credit to accounts receivable. Changes in the valuation allowance have not
been material to the consolidated financial statements.
9. Restricted Assets
Restricted assets are assets restricted by the covenants of long-term financial or other
contractual arrangements.
10. Capital Assets
Property and equipment are stated at historical cost. Capital assets are defined by RTD as
assets with an initial, individual cost of more than $5 and an estimated useful life in excess
of one year. Maintenance and repairs are charged to current period operating expenses
and improvements are capitalized. Upon retirement or other disposition of property and
equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective
accounts and any gains or losses are included in non-operating revenue and expense. A
pro-rata share of proceeds from the sale of property and equipment, which were acquired
with federal funds, is required to be reinvested in a similar asset.
Prior to 2020, interest was capitalized on assets financed with debt or certificates of
participation from the date of the borrowing until completion of the project. The amount
of tax-exempt and taxable debt and certificates of participation (externally restricted)
interest to be capitalized is the difference between the interest expense and interest
earnings on issuance proceeds. The amount of other interest to be capitalized is calculated
by weighted average construction expenditures multiplied by the weighted average interest
rate of the outstanding obligations.
Total interest cost of RTD consisted of the following as of December 31:

Fully depreciated assets, which are still in use, are included in the asset balances in the
accompanying financial statements. The cost of fully depreciated assets was approximately
$485,650 and $417,209 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
12. Deferred Outflows/Inflows of Resources
In addition to assets, the statement of financial position will report a separate section for
deferred outflows of resources. This separate financial statement element represents a
consumption of net position that applies to a future period(s) and thus, will not be
recognized as an outflow of resources (expense/expenditure) until then.
In addition to liabilities, the statement of financial position will sometimes report a separate
section for deferred inflows of resources. This separate financial statement element
represents an acquisition of net position that applies to a future period(s) and so will not be
recognized as an inflow of resources (revenue) until that time.
13. Compensated Absences
RTD employees receive compensation for vacations, holidays, illness, and certain other
qualifying absences. The number of days compensated in the various categories of absence
is based generally on length of service. Compensated absences, which have been earned
but not paid, have been included as liabilities in the accompanying financial statements.
14. Self-Insurance
Liabilities for property damage, personal injury and qualifying unemployment benefits are
recognized as incurred on the basis of the estimated cost to RTD. In addition, RTD offers
a self-insured health benefit option as part of its employee benefits program in which costs
are recognized as they are incurred.
15. Revenue Recognition
Passenger Fares
Passenger fares are recorded as revenue at the time services are performed and revenue is
collected. Sale of MyRide stored value, mobile ticketing products, monthly passes, ticket
books and day pass tickets are recorded as income at the time of sale. Sales of collegebased passes, which are valid for a specific academic semester, are recorded initially as
unearned revenue then recognized as income at the end of each month, with the amount

December 31, 2020 and 2019 (Dollars in Thousands)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sales and Use Taxes
Under the provisions of the Act, as amended, RTD levies a sales tax of 1.0% on
net taxable sales made within the District and a use tax of 1.0% on items purchased for use
inside the District. As described in Note E, under the terms of the Sales Tax Revenue Bonds,
Series 2007A, Series 2010B, Series 2012A, Series 2013A, 2016A, 2017A, 2017B, 2019A bond
resolutions and the TIFIA loan, sales and use tax revenue is pledged for payment of debt
service. Sales and use taxes are collected by the State of Colorado Department of Revenue
and are remitted to a trustee who satisfies debt service requirements for these obligations
through remittances to a trustee and then remits the remaining balance to RTD.
Sales and use taxes are recorded as revenue by RTD in the month collected by the
merchant. Sales tax bond and TIFIA loan debt service will be paid from the collateralized
sales and use tax revenues in the amount of approximately $3,592,863 through 2050.
Principal and interest paid for the current year and pledged revenues received were
$102,767.
Grants and Local Contributions
RTD receives grants from the federal government through the Federal Transit
Administration (FTA). Grants are also awarded to RTD by State of Colorado through the
Colorado Department of Transportation. The federal and state governments issue grants
to RTD for operations and acquisition of property and equipment.
The amount recorded as capital grant revenue was $66,215 and $116,303 in 2020 and
2019, respectively. Operating assistance grant revenue was $316,848 and $86,263 in 2020
and 2019, respectively. Other contribution revenue was $29,962 and $8,194 in 2020 and
2019, respectively.
In March, 2020, RTD was awarded $232,254 in federal COVID-19 relief grant funding
through the Coronavirus, Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act to maintain transit
operations. The CARES Act funding was fully drawn by RTD during 2020 and is included in
operating assistance grant revenue.
Grants and local contributions are recorded as revenue by RTD once all applicable eligibility
requirements are met.
16. Use of Estimates
The financial statements contained herein have been prepared in accordance with Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). GAAP are uniform minimum standards of and
guidelines to financial accounting and reporting. GAAP establishes appropriate

recognized determined by prorating the total contract amount over the semesters/quarters
covered. Sales of EcoPass and Neighborhood Pass, which are valid through December 31
of a given year, are recorded initially as unearned revenue then recognized as income at
the end of each month, with the total contract amount prorated evenly over the number of
months of the contract.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

17. Pensions
For purposes of measuring RTD’s net pension liabilities, deferred outflows of resources and
deferred inflows of resources related to pensions and pension expense, information about
the pension plan’s fiduciary net position and additions to/deductions from the plan’s
fiduciary net position have been determined on the same basis as they are reported by the
plan. For this purpose, benefit payments (including refunds of employee contributions) are
recognized when due and payable in accordance with the benefit terms. Investments are
reported at fair value.
18. TABOR (Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights) – Reserve Composition
Restricted net position represents amounts constrained by external parties or legislation. In
1992, Colorado voters approved an amendment to the state constitution referred to as the
TABOR Amendment in which certain annual limitations were placed on the growth of
government revenues. The Amendment also requires that an emergency reserve, referred
to as Restricted TABOR, of 3.0% of fiscal year spending excluding debt service be
maintained for all years subsequent to 1994 for declared emergencies.
19. Upcoming Accounting Pronouncements

GASB 87
In June 2017, the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) issued Statement No.
87, Leases, which improves accounting and financial reporting for leases by governments.
This statement requires recognition of certain lease assets and liabilities for leases that
previously were classified as operating leases and recognized as inflows of resources or
outflows of resources based on the payment provisions of the contract. It establishes a
single model for lease accounting based on the foundational principle that leases are
financings of the right to use an underlying asset. Under this statement, a lessee is required
to recognize a lease liability and an intangible right-to-use lease asset, and a lessor is
required to recognize a lease receivable and a deferred inflow of resources. RTD is currently
evaluating the impact this standard will have on the financial statements when adopted.
The provisions of this statement were originally effective for the RTD's financial statements
for the year ending December 31, 2021, but were extended to December 31, 2022 with the
issuance of GASB Statement No. 95, Postponement of Effective Dates of Certain
Authoritative Guidance.

52

Packet Pg. 75

Attachment: ACFR 2020 (4527 : 2020 Annual Comprehensive Financial Report (ACFR))

measurement and classification criteria for financial reporting. Adherence to GAAP provides
a reasonable degree of comparability among the financial reports of state and local
governmental units. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP
involves the use of management’s estimates. These estimates are based upon
management’s best judgments after considering past and current events and assumptions
about future events. Actual results may differ from estimates.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In June 2018, the GASB issued Statement No. 89, Accounting for Interest Cost Incurred
before the End of a Construction Period, which simplifies accounting for interest cost
incurred before the end of construction and requires those costs to be expensed in the
period incurred. As a result, interest cost incurred before the end of a construction period
will not be capitalized and included in the historical cost of a capital asset reported in a
business-type activity or enterprise fund. This statement also reiterates that, in financial
statements prepared using the current financial resources measurement focus, interest cost
incurred before the end of a construction period should be recognized as an expenditure
on a basis consistent with governmental fund accounting principles. The requirements of
the standard will be applied prospectively and result in increased interest expense during
periods of construction. The provisions of this statement were originally effective for RTD’s
financial statements for the December 31, 2020 fiscal year, but were extended to December
31, 2021 with the issuance of GASB Statement No. 95, Postponement of Effective Dates of
Certain Authoritative Guidance.

GASB 91
In May 2019, the GASB issued Statement No. 91, Conduit Debt Obligations, which clarifies
the existing definition of conduit debt, provides a single method of reporting conduit debt
obligations by issuers, and eliminates diversity in practice associated with commitments
extended by issuers, arrangements associated with conduit debt obligations, and related
note disclosures. As a result, issuers should not recognize a liability for items meeting the
definition of conduit debt; however, a liability should be recorded for additional or voluntary
commitments to support debt service if certain recognition criteria are met. The standard
also addresses the treatment of arrangements where capital assets are constructed or
acquired with the proceeds of a conduit debt obligation and used by a third-party obligor.
The requirements of the standard will be applied retrospectively and are effective for RTD's
financial statements for the December 31, 2022 fiscal year.

GASB 92
In January 2020, the GASB issued Statement No. 92, Omnibus 2020. This statement
addresses eight unrelated practice issues and technical inconsistencies in authoritative
literature. The standard addresses leases, intra-entity transfers of assets, post-employment
benefits, government acquisitions, risk financing and insurance-related activities of public
entity risk pools, fair value measurements, and derivative instruments. The standard has
various effective dates. RTD does not believe this pronouncement will have a significant
impact on its financial statements but is still making a full evaluation.

GASB 94
In March 2020, the GASB issued Statement No. 94, Public-Private and Public-Public
Partnerships and Availability Payment Arrangements, to bring a uniform guidance on how
to report public-private and public-public partnership arrangements. As a result, transferors
in public-private or public-public arrangements will recognize receivables for installment
payments, deferred inflows of resources, and, when applicable, capital assets. Operators

will recognize liabilities for installment payments and intangible right-to-use assets, and
when applicable, deferred outflows of resources and liabilities for assets being transferred.
This statement also provides guidance for accounting and financial reporting for availability
payment arrangements, in which a government compensates an operator for services such
as designing, constructing, financing, maintaining, or operating an underlying asset for a
period of time in an exchange of exchange-like transaction. The provisions of this statement
are effective for RTD’s financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2023.

GASB 97
In June 2020, the Governmental Accounting Standards Board issued GASB Statement No.
97, Certain Component Unit Criteria, and Accounting and Financial Reporting for Internal
Revenue Code Section 457 Deferred Compensation Plans. While this standard had certain
aspects impacting defined contribution pension and OPEB plans and other employee benefit
plans that were effective immediately, it also clarifies when a 457 plan should be considered
a pension plan or another employee benefit plan to assist in the application of GASB
Statement No. 84 to these types of plans. RTD is currently evaluating the impact this
standard will have on the financial statements when adopted. The provisions of this
statement related to 457 plans are effective for RTD's financial statements for the year
ending December 31, 2022.
20. Change in Accounting Principle
In 2020, RTD adopted GASB 84, Fiduciary Activities, which establishes criteria for
identifying and reporting fiduciary activities. As a result of implementing this standard,
the accounting for fiduciary components has changed. RTD has included the financial
statements of those fiduciary activities for December 31, 2020 and 2019 in the Financial
Statement section and the Other Supplementary Information section of this report. The
impact of adoption is included below.

NOTE B – DEPOSI TS AND I NVESTM ENTS

RTD’s deposits are subject to the State of Colorado’s Public Deposit Protection Act (PDPA).
Under this act, all uninsured public deposits at qualified institutions are fully collateralized with
pledged collateral which is held in custody by any Federal Reserve Bank or branch thereof, or
held in escrow by another bank in a manner as the banking Commissioner shall prescribe by
rule and regulation, or may be segregated from the other assets of the eligible public depository
and held in its own trust department. Colorado’s PDPA requires that pledged collateral to be
held is clearly identified as being securely maintained or pledged for the aggregate amount of
public deposits accepted and held on deposit by the eligible public depository. The public
depository has the right at any time to make substitutions of eligible collateral that is maintained
or pledged and is at all times entitled to collect and retain all income derived from those
investments without restrictions.
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, RTD had bank deposits of $11,799 and $5,861
collateralized with securities held by the pledging financial institutions’ trust department or
agent but not in RTD’s name.

Fair Value M easurem ents
In March 2015, the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) released Statement No.
72, Fair Value Measurement and Application, which would generally require state and local
governments to measure investments at fair value. GASB's goal is to enhance comparability of
governmental financial statements by requiring fair value measurement for certain assets and
liabilities using a consistent definition and accepted valuation techniques. This standard
expands fair value disclosures to provide comprehensive information for financial statement
users about the impact of fair value measurements on a government's financial position.
Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in an active market for identical assets or liabilities that RTD

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In April 2018, GASB issued Statement 88, Certain Disclosures Related to Debt, Including Direct
Borrowings and Direct Placement. The primary objective of GASB 88 related to providing
additional information regarding debt, including direct borrowings and direct placements. It also
clarifies which liabilities governments should include when disclosing information statements as a
liability that arises from a contractual obligation to pay cash (or other assets that may be used in
lieu of cash) in one or more payments to settle an amount that is fixed at the date the contractual
obligation is established. GASB 88 requires that additional essential information related to debt
be disclosed in notes to financial statements, including unused lines of credit, assets pledged as
collateral for the debt and terms specified in debt agreements related to significant events of
default with finance-related consequences, significant termination events with finance-related
consequences and significant subjective acceleration clauses.
For notes to financial statements related to debt, GASB 88 also requires that existing and
additional information be provided for direct borrowings and direct placements of debt. The
requirements of this statement are effective for reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2018.
RTD implemented the new reporting requirements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020
and amending December 31, 2019 tables where necessary. There was no impact on the changes
in fund balance or net position as a result of the adoption of this statement.
RTD sales tax revenue bonds Series 2007A, 2010B, 2012A, 2013A, 2016A, 2017A, 2017B, and
2019A and the TIFIA loan are secured by a pledge of future sales and use tax revenues. These
tax-secured future liabilities of $3,592,863 remain outstanding through 2050. The pledged
revenue includes a 0.6% and 0.4% tax on the net taxable sales made within the District and use
taxes of 0.6% and 0.4% on items purchased for use inside the District. For the year 2020, these
tax-generated revenues were $632,655.
RTD’s Base System sales tax obligations are secured by a 0.6% sales and use tax. The Fastracks
bonds and TIFIA loan are secured by a 0.4% sales and use tax and a subordinate pledge from
the 0.6% Base System sales tax. Per TABOR, at the time that all FasTracks debt is repaid, RTD’s
0.4% sales and use tax rate will be reduced to a rate sufficient to operate and maintain the assets
financed through FasTracks. For the year 2020 and 2019, respectively, RTD paid interest and
principal for sales tax revenue bonds and TIFIA loan of $102,767 and $104,377.

stated TIFIA loan interest rate. The TIFIA loan is secured by a senior pledge of RTD’s 0.4% sales
and use tax and a subordinate pledge of the 0.6% sales and use tax. The TIFIA loan debt service
schedules have been developed to allow for a projected 2.0x coverage, in accordance with RTD’s
sales tax bond resolutions and the TIFIA Loan Agreement. In addition, in 2016 RTD refunded
the Series 2002A Certificates with a capital lease agreement with JP Morgan Chase Bank N.A. In
2017, RTD refunded portions of previously outstanding Series 2010A and Series 2015A
Certificates with a capital lease agreement with JP Morgan Chase Bank N.A. Furthermore,
refunding of the Series 2007 Certificates was completed with a direct placement loan with DEPFA
Bank.

Both the sales tax bonds and TIFIA loan are secured by RTD’s 1.0% sales and use tax for which
debt service payments are withheld by a trustee from the monthly remittance prior to the
Colorado Department of Revenue remitting such taxes to RTD. Withholdings are equivalent to a
proportionate monthly amount of the annual principal and semi-annual interest payments and
are held by the trustee until such debt service payments are satisfied.
Certificates are issued by the Asset Acquisition Authority, Inc. (Authority), a nonprofit corporation
and component unit of RTD. The Authority issued Certificates with the proceeds used to acquire
certain equipment, facilities and infrastructure to be used by RTD as well as for construction of
the North Metro (N Line) commuter rail line. RTD leases the equipment acquired and elements
constructed with the proceeds from the Certificates under separate master lease purchase

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ATU 1001 Pension P lan – Defined Benefit (2020)

The Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU) Local 1001 Pension Plan was established pursuant to a
collective bargaining agreement (CBA) between RTD and the ATU. This plan covers substantially
all full-time union-represented employees in accordance with the CBA. The plan is a singleemployer defined benefit pension plan administered by Compusys, Inc.

Benefits Provided
All benefits are paid in the form of a 50% joint and survivor annuity unless this form is rejected
by the participant and the spouse.
Normal retirement benefits under the ATU Plan are paid to participants who have attained age
65 and have been in the ATU Plan for 10 years. The benefit amount is based on final average
earnings, years of employment and age at the date of retirement.
Effective January 1, 1992, any participant who has accumulated 20 or more years of credited
service and terminated employment prior to attaining age 50 will be entitled to an early retirement
benefit starting on the first day of any month after he or she has attained age 50. The ATU Plan
was subsequently amended effective January 1, 2011 for new employees in which the years of
credited service needed to qualify for a normal retirement benefit was increased from five to 10
years and the benefit multiplier for both the normal and early retirement was revised.
Death benefits state if an employee who is not eligible for a vested benefit or not eligible to retire,
should die, his or her beneficiary will be paid the accumulated employee contributions plus
interest. Upon the death of a pensioner, a funeral benefit of $2 (two thousand dollars) will be
paid in a lump sum to the pensioner’s designated beneficiary.
An individual who becomes totally disabled prior to age 65 and retires from active employment
with RTD as a direct result of being totally disabled is entitled to a disability retirement benefit
provided he or she has worked for at least 10 years for RTD in covered employment. An individual
will be considered totally disabled upon receipt of a disability award from the Social Security
Administration. Effective January 1, 2011 the years of credited service needed to qualify for a
disability benefit was increased from five to 10 years and the benefit multiplier was revised.
An individual who terminated employment on or after January 1, 1993, for any reason other than
retirement, will be entitled to a deferred vested benefit at age 65 provided he or she had worked
for at least 10 years in covered employment for RTD. A participant is entitled to deferred, vested
benefits as early as age 50 if he or she has worked for at least 20 years in covered employment
and terminates active employment on or after attaining age 50. If an individual with 20 or more
years of service terminated employment prior to age 50, benefits will be payable at any time after
age 50. Effective January 1, 2011 the years of credited service needed to qualify for a deferred
vested retirement benefit was increased from five to 10 years and the benefit multiplier was
revised.

Single Discount Rate
Projected benefit payments are required to be discounted to their actuarial present values using
a single discount rate that reflects (1) a long-term expected rate of return on pension plan
investments (to the extent that the plan’s fiduciary net position is projected to be sufficient to
pay benefits) and (2) tax-exempt municipal bond rate based on an index of 20-year general
obligation bonds with an average AA credit rating as of the measurement date (to the extent that
the plan’s projected fiduciary net position is not sufficient to pay benefits).
For the purpose of this valuation, the expected rate of return on pension plan investments is
7.00%, the municipal bond rate is 2.75% (based on the daily rate closest to but not later than
the measurement date of the Fidelity “20-Year Municipal GO AA Index”) and the resulting single
discount rate is 7.00%.

Projected benefit payments are required to be discounted to their actuarial present values using
a single discount rate that reflects (1) a long-term expected rate of return on pension plan
investments (to the extent that the plan’s fiduciary net position is projected to be sufficient to
pay benefits) and (2) tax-exempt municipal bond rate based on an index of 20-year general
obligation bonds with an average AA credit rating as of the measurement date (to the extent that
the plan’s projected fiduciary net position is not sufficient to pay benefits).
For the purpose of this valuation, the expected rate of return on pension plan investments is
7.00%, the municipal bond rate is 3.71% (based on the daily rate closest to but not later than
the measurement date of the Fidelity “20-Year Municipal GO AA Index”) and the resulting single

Credited service is one year for each calendar year of 1,000 hours of service (except years and
completed months in the year of transfer). Credited service applies to vesting and service for
retirement benefit eligibility. Average final compensation is the average of the participant's
highest consecutive 36 months of compensation in the last 120 months of credited service
immediately preceding the calendar month in which retirement occurs. Compensation excludes

Contributions
Employee contributions are a source of revenue for the Trust and prior to 2013 were based on
a percentage of the Regional Transportation District’s (RTD) salaried employees’ base
compensation. Due to the decreasing active population and resulting reduction in future
expected payroll, the RTD Board approved a funding policy effective January 1, 2013, where
the recommended dollar contribution up to a cap of $3.1 million is made to the Trust each
year. This funding policy was established with the goal of achieving 100% funding by the end
of 2032; however, due to net actuarial losses, the RTD Board adopted a new funding policy
effective in 2016 to remove the $3.1 million maximum and allowed for an amount to be
contributed to keep the Trust “actuarially sound” based on recommendations from the Trust’s
actuary and RTD’s Chief Financial Officer. Note that the recommended contribution can
fluctuate annually due to such factors as projected total base compensation, investment
results, and retirement patterns of participants. RTD contributed $6.1 million in 2020 and $5.1
million in 2019.

Single Discount Rate

Attachment: ACFR 2020 (4527 : 2020 Annual Comprehensive Financial Report (ACFR))

The long-term expected rates of return on pension plan investments were determined using
a building-block method in which best estimate ranges of expected future real rates of return
are developed for each major asset class. These ranges are combined to produce the long-term
expected rate of return by weighting the expected future real rates of return by the target asset
allocation percentage including expected inflation.

The discount rate used to measure the total pension liability was 7.00%. The projection of
cash flows used to determine the discount rate assumed that RTD contributions would be equal
to the actuarially determined contribution rate for the applicable fiscal years. Based on those
assumptions, the pension plan’s fiduciary net position was projected to be available to make all
projected future benefit payments of current plan members.
Therefore, the long-term
expected rate of return on pension plan investments was applied to all periods of projected
benefit payments to determine the total pension liability. The discount rate does not

them to defer a portion of their compensation to future years. Under the terms of the Plan, the
unearned compensation is available to participants upon termination, retirement, death or in the
event of an unforeseeable emergency or other financial hardship.
Compensated Absences
RTD considers all accrued compensated absences as due within one year. Employees accrue paid
time off (PTO), vacation and sick leave based on years of service. Employees are not allowed to
accumulate more than twice their annual PTO or vacation accrual and sick leave based on years
of service. Employees are paid any outstanding compensated absence balances upon leaving
RTD. RTD records these accrued compensated absences as current liabilities under the principle
of conservatism by assuming these amounts are the most RTD would be obligated to pay.

Commitments

In 1976, RTD entered into an operating lease for a portion of the land on which the Civic Center
transfer facility is located in downtown Denver. As collateral for the lease, RTD must maintain an
account balance with a minimum market value of $1,500 in an escrow account, the interest on which
accrues to RTD until the lease expires. This amount in escrow is included in restricted assets in the
accompanying financial statements.

Operating Lease – Civic Center Transfer Facility

RTD has entered into a number of transactions in which certain of its light rail vehicles have been
leased to and subleased back from certain U.S. and foreign companies and has entered into a
transaction in which its maintenance facilities have been leased to and subleased back. As part
of these transactions, RTD irrevocably set aside certain monies (which were received from each
counter party as payment for its leasing of light rail vehicles and real property) with a third party
trustee.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The monies held by such trustees will be utilized to make the lease payments owed by the RTD
under the transactions and are therefore considered fully funded and economically defeased.

As of December 31, 2020, RTD has contracts for the construction of various capital projects and
the purchase of buses and light rail vehicles. The costs to complete these projects and the
purchase of buses and light rail vehicles total $82,604 and $115,716 in 2020 and 2019,
respectively.

Grant Match Requirements
Under the provisions of current grants, RTD is obligated to satisfy certain matching requirements.
At December 31, 2020, RTD had a commitment to provide $74,066 in matching funds in order to
receive $109,629 in future federal and state grant funds.

Privatization Contracts
In response to the privatization legislation (Note A), RTD has awarded contracts for specific
groups of routes not to exceed 58% as required by law for vehicular services. As of January
2020, 57.1% of RTD’s non-rail transit services are delivered by private contractors operating
under the auspices and direction of RTD.

ADA Paratransit Service
With the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990, RTD was mandated to
provide paratransit service to persons with disabilities unable to use RTD’s fixed route buses. This
service, branded Access-a-Ride, is a curb-to-curb transportation system offered to persons with
disabilities who cannot functionally use RTD’s regular fixed route system. Customers eligible for
Access-a-Ride services must originate their trip within 3/4 of a mile of an RTD fixed route. Since
September 1996, RTD has been in full compliance with ADA requirement to provide paratransit
service to persons with disabilities unable to use the fixed route system.
Future Commitments under Construction Contracts
In 2010, RTD entered into a public-private partnership (P3) to design, build, finance and operate
several of the transit improvements contemplated under the FasTracks program, including the
Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility, the East Rail Corridor (A Line), the Gold Line Rail Corridor
(G Line) and the electrified segment of the Northwest Rail Corridor (B Line), together, the “Eagle
P3 Project.” The Eagle P3 Project is being delivered and operated under a concession agreement
that RTD has entered with a concessionaire that was selected through a competitive proposal
process. The selected concessionaire, Denver Transit Partners (DTP), is a special purpose
company owned by Fluor Enterprises, Uberior Investments and Laing Investments.

Attachment: ACFR 2020 (4527 : 2020 Annual Comprehensive Financial Report (ACFR))

Capital Projects

The Eagle P3 Project construction was completed in two phases with Phase I completed in 2016
and Phase II completed in 2019. Under the terms of the Eagle P3 Project agreement, RTD made
scheduled construction payments to DTP from 2011 through 2017 for completed project
elements. RTD began commuter rail services on the University of Colorado A Line and the B
Line in 2016 and began services on the G Line in 2019. Under the terms of the concessionaire
agreement, RTD will make scheduled secured principal and interest payments to DTP from 2017

Line (N Line). The N Line is an 18.5-mile electric commuter rail line that will run from Denver
Union Station through Commerce City, Thornton and Northglenn to Highway 7 at 162nd Avenue
in North Adams County. The N Line opened in September of 2020 with service extending to 124th
Avenue.
In 2014, RTD entered a contract with Balfour Beatty Infrastructure, Inc. to design and construct
the Southeast Rail Extension (SERE) Project. SERE includes 2.3 miles extending the existing
Southeast Light rail Line from Lincoln Station through the City of Lone Tree to RidgeGate Parkway
Station featuring a new Park-n-Ride with a structure of 1,300 parking spaces. SERE opened in

Self-Insurance

RTD does not carry excess liability insurance for personal injury and property damage. Under
the provisions of the Colorado Government Immunity Act, the maximum liability, with certain
exceptions as defined in the Act, to RTD for claims involving personal injury and property damage
is $387 per individual and $1,093 per incident.
For worker’s compensation, an excess coverage insurance policy covers individual claims in excess
of $2,000. The amount of settlements has not exceeded insurance coverage in any of the past
three years.
RTD’s liability for unpaid claims includes an amount for claims that have been incurred but not
reported (IBNR).
RTD’s Risk Management Department determines incurred claims by
investigating the accident and establishing a reserve. Reserves are established on the day of
assignment, reviewed at 30 days and again at 90 days. Reserves are reviewed every 90 days
thereafter and based on ultimate exposure. This amount is included in other accrued expenses
in the statement of net assets. Changes in the balances of claims liabilities for both general
liability and worker’s compensation during the past year are as follows:

Contract Disputes and Legal Proceedings
RTD is party to a number of pending or threatened tort lawsuits, workers’ compensation claims,
or labor/employment claims under which it may be required to pay certain amounts upon final
disposition of these matters. RTD also has certain contract disputes being considered in
contractual dispute resolution proceedings. RTD’s legal counsel estimates that the ultimate
outcome of these matters is sufficiently covered by RTD’s general liability or worker’s
compensation reserves, project contingencies, or insurance, or would not otherwise materially
affect the financial statements of RTD.

Attachment: ACFR 2020 (4527 : 2020 Annual Comprehensive Financial Report (ACFR))

RTD is self-insured for general liability and Workers’ Compensation claims. Liabilities are reported
when it is probable that a loss has occurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably
estimated. In addition, RTD offers a self-insured health benefit option as part of its employee
benefits program in which costs are recognized as they are incurred.

The concessionaire for the Eagle Project, Denver Transit Partners, has filed litigation in Denver
District Court asserting claims against RTD based on an alleged change in law. DTP has alleged
damages for those claims in excess of $120,000 and RTD has filed a counterclaim of

budget also includes proceeds of long-term debt and capital grants as revenue and expenditures
include capital outlays and obligation principal payments and excludes TABOR rebates under
Amendment 1 of the Colorado Constitution, extraordinary loss and depreciation on, as well as
gains and losses on disposition of property and equipment. The budget sets forth all proposed
outlays for operations, planning, administration, development, debt service, and capital outlays
for the fiscal year. Prior to October 15, the RTD General Manager submits to the Board of
Directors a proposed operating and capital budget for the fiscal year commencing the following
January 1, which is made available for public inspection and comment. On or before
December 31, the budget is adopted in conjunction with an appropriation resolution by the Board
of Directors, who must also approve subsequent amendments thereto. In the absence of such
adoption, RTD has authority to begin making expenditures limited to 90% of the prior year’s
approved appropriation. RTD’s policy on budget transfers authorizes the RTD General Manager
to approve certain transfers within the budget.

NOTE K – TAX, SPENDI NG AND DEBT LI M I TATI ONS
In November 1992, Colorado voters passed an amendment (Amendment 1) to the State
Constitution (Article X, Section 20) that limits the revenue raising and spending abilities of state
and local governments known as the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights (TABOR). The limits on property
taxes, revenue, and “fiscal year spending” include allowable annual increases tied to inflation and
local growth in construction valuation. Fiscal year spending as defined by the amendment
excludes spending from certain revenue and financing sources such as federal funds, gifts,
property sales, fund transfers, damage awards, and fund reserves. Amendment 1 requires voter
approval for any increase in mill levy tax rates, new taxes, or creation of multi-year debt. Revenue
earned in excess of the “spending limit” must be refunded to the taxpayers unless voters approve
retention of these revenues. In addition, Amendment 1 mandates that reserves equal to 3% of
fiscal spending be established for declared emergencies.

On November 7, 1995, the voters of the District exempted RTD from the revenue and spending

voters of the District further exempted RTD from the revenue and spending limitations outlined
in Amendment 1 for the purpose of paying any debt incurred to finance the Southeast Corridor
light rail project or to operate such project for as long as any debt remains outstanding, but in
no event beyond December 31, 2026.

On November 2, 2004, the voters of the District authorized an increase in RTD’s sales and use
tax rate from 0.6% to 1.0%, effective January 1, 2005, to finance the FasTracks transit
improvement program. This authorization also exempted RTD from any revenue and spending
limitations on the additional tax and on any investment income generated by the increased tax
revenue and allowed RTD to incur debt to finance the capital improvements included in the
FasTracks program. At the time that all FasTracks debt is repaid, RTD’s sales and use tax rate
will be reduced to a rate sufficient to operate the transit system financed through FasTracks. RTD
has $3.477 billion in authorized debt, subject to Amendment 1’s limitations. This debt was
authorized by the voters of the District in 2004 to pay for the FasTracks transit improvement
program. Based on estimated fiscal year spending for 2020, $26,861 of year-end net position
has been reserved for emergencies. Amendment 1 is complex and subject to judicial
interpretation. RTD believes it is in compliance with the requirements of Amendment 1 based on
the interpretations of the amendment’s language available at year-end.

NOTE L – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
In December 2019, a novel strain of the coronavirus (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, Hubei
Province, China. The virus subsequently spread globally resulting in a worldwide pandemic which
is expected to cause significant disruptions to the economy. Several measures have been
implemented by governments in the District including directives for social distancing and stay-athome orders to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. These measures have severely curtailed activity
within the District with RTD experiencing an approximate 70% reduction in ridership that began
in mid-March 2020. In response, RTD undertook several initiatives including safety precautions
for its employees and evaluating service levels, costs and impacts to revenue. On March 26,
2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (CARES) was signed into law in which
grant funding through the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) of $232,254 was made available
to RTD to fund operations during the pandemic. On April 5, 2020, RTD suspended the collection
of fares in accordance with social distancing measures and on April 19, 2020 RTD reduced its
transit services by approximately 40% to reduce costs and adjust services to the lower demand.
The extent to which COVID-19 impacts RTD’s operations and financial condition will depend on
future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence,
including the duration of the outbreak.
In January 2021, RTD received notice that it had received a federal funding grant apportionment
of $203,368 from the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act
(CRRSAA). The CRRSAA grant is 100% federally funded with no local match required and is to
be used primarily for sustaining transit operations. RTD intends to fully draw this funding during
2021 for those purposes.

In February 2021, RTD and the Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU) Local 1001 extended by one

In March 2021, RTD refunded its FasTracks Series 2012A bonds and TIFIA loan for interest
savings. The Series 2012A bonds included a call provision for 2022 for which those bonds were
defeased as an advance refunding.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Approval of Amended and Restated RTD Defined
Contribution Plan

Committee Meeting Date:
June 15, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
June 15, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the changes contained in the attached plan documents for the RTD
Salaried Employees’ Defined Contribution Plan.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
BACKGROUND
RTD provides a defined contribution retirement plan (DC Plan) to all non-represented (Salaried)
employees hired on or after January 1, 2008. Salaried employees hired prior to this date participate in a
defined benefit pension plan (DB Plan).
The Salaried Employee’s Defined Contribution Plan is overseen by a Board of Trustees consisting of four
RTD employees and two members of the RTD Board of Directors. The DC Plan is governed by the
attached Plan document which was last modified for an effective date of January 1, 2014.
DISCUSSION
The DC Plan documents require updating to incorporate prior amendments, to adopt required changes
resulting from the Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement (“SECURE”) ACT (Division
O of the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act enacted December 20, 2019), and the regulations
thereunder, and to clarify certain Plan provisions to align with Plan administration. Attached are a redline version containing those changes as well as a final version incorporating those changes. The
changes are a result of discussions between the DC Plan Board of Trustees and the Trust Attorney. A
summary of the changes follows:
•
•
•
•
•

Clarification of language regarding employer contribution eligibility
Clarification of language regarding the five-year vesting period
Clarification regarding breaks in service and time off as applied to vesting
Updating required minimum distribution provisions as required by the SECURE Act
Updating terminology as well as references to individuals and Internal Revenue Service and
Treasury Department regulations

Approval of these DC Plan changes would be effective retroactively to January 1, 2021. Because this is
a calendar-year plan, a retroactive restatement date within the 2021 plan year is permissible.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There are no known financial impacts from this Recommended Action.

Account, established and maintained by the Trustees in the Participant's name, to be dealt with as
described in subsectionsSubsections (a), (b) and (c) below, depending upon whether or not the
Participant incurs a Permanent Break in Service. However, if an Employee’s participation in the

Employee because the One-Year Break in Service will become a Permanent Break in Service, and
the balance of the Participant’s Account will be forfeited, subject to paragraph 5.6(d). In addition,

does not incur a Permanent Break in Service, then the credit balance to such Suspense Account
shall be transferred back to the Participant’s reconstituted Account after the first Plan Year for
which the Participant is credited with a Year of Service, and the Participant may fully restore his
or her Account by making the payment specified in paragraph (c) of this Section, if applicable.

Participants who have a Suspense Account, if there has been a distribution pursuant to Section
7.3(d) and the Participant returns to employment before five (5) years from their termination of
employment, then the Employer will restore their Suspense Account, and the pertinent provisions
of 5.6(a), (b) and (c) will apply.
(c)

Restoration of Participant’s Account. If a Participant has received a

distribution of his or her Account representing less than 100% of such account, and then is
subsequently re-employed before incurring a Permanent Break in Service, the Participant may
repay 100% of the distribution amount received from his or her Account to the Plan so long as
such payment is made prior to the date the amount previously distributed to him or her incurs a
tax. Such repayment must be made on or before the last day of the period beginning with the first
day the Participant is subsequently re-employed, and ending 180 days thereafter. Upon such
repayment, a Participant's Account shall consist of the amount repaid plus the portion of such
account which was not vested upon separation from service. If a Participant eligible to make such
repayment fails to do so, the amount previously forfeited shall not be restored to his account..
(d)

Use of Forfeiture Account. The aggregate amount of any forfeitures arising

during a Plan Year shall first be used to offset expenses of the Plan. Any forfeitures remaining at
the end of the Plan Year in excess of $100,000.00 shall be allocated to reduce the Employer
Contributions.
Section 5.7 -- Leaves of Absence; Military Service.
A leave of absence granted by the Employer for purposes other than military service
shall not be considered as a Break in Service or a separation from service.
Any employee or Participant who has entered or enters the Armed Forces of the
United States shall be presumed to be on a leave of absence, regardless of the length of such
service, and such leave of absence shall not be considered as a Break in Service or a separation
from service, provided he or she returns to the employ of the Employer within ninety (90) days of

in the event of service-caused disability, without intervening employment elsewhere.
A Participant shall not be credited with Hours of Service during any period during
which he is on a leave of absence or in military service, as provided above, unless he receives or
is entitled to receive compensation from the Employer for such period, or as such crediting may
be required to comply with any applicable law, including USERRA.
In the case of a death occurring on or after January 1, 2007, if a Participant dies
while performing qualified military service (as defined in Code Section 414(u)), the Participant's
Beneficiary is entitled to any additional benefits (other than benefit accruals relating to the period
of qualified military service) provided under the Plan as if the Participant had resumed
employment and then terminated employment on account of death. Moreover, the Plan will credit
the Participant's qualified military service as service for vesting purposes, as though the Participant
had resumed employment under USERRA immediately prior to the Participant's death.
Section 5.8 -- Vesting Upon Termination or Partial Termination of Plan or
Discontinuance of Contributions to the Plan.
Upon the termination or partial termination of the Plan or the complete

Vested Account to such person or persons as may be entitled thereto under the laws of the state
where such Participant resides at the date of his or her death, and in such case, the TrusteesPlan
Administrator may require such proof of right or indemnity from such person or persons as the
TrusteesPlan Administrator may deem necessary.

beneficiary, then distributions to the surviving spouse will begin by December 31 of the calendar
year immediately following the calendar year in which the Participant died, or by December 31
of the calendar year in which the Participant would have attained age 70 1/2, or age seventy-two
(72) for a Participant turning 70-1/2 after December 31, 2019, if later.
(2)

If the Participant's surviving spouse is not the Participant's sole designated

(3)

If there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year

Death On or After Date Distributions Begin.
(iA)

Participant Survived by Designated Beneficiary. If the Participant

dies on or after the date distributions begin and there is a designated beneficiary, the minimum
amount that will be distributed for each distribution calendar year after the year of the Participant's
death is the quotient obtained by dividing the Participant's account balance by the longer of the
remaining life expectancy of the Participant or the remaining life expectancy of the Participant's
designated beneficiary, determined as follows:
(Ai)

The Participant's remaining life expectancy is calculated

using the age of the Participant in the year of death, reduced by one for each subsequent year.
(Bii)

If the Participant's surviving spouse is the Participant's sole

designated beneficiary, or if the Participant dies after December 31, 2019, an “Eligible Designated
Beneficiary” (as defined in Code Section 401(a)(9)(E)(ii) and determined as of the date of the
Participant’s death), the remaining life expectancy of the surviving spousebeneficiary is calculated
for each distribution calendar year after the year of the Participant's death using the surviving
spouse'beneficiary’s age as of the spouse'beneficiary’s birthday in that year. For distribution
calendar years after the year of the surviving spouse'beneficiary’s death, the remaining life
expectancy of the surviving spousebeneficiary is calculated using the age of the surviving
spousebeneficiary as of the spousebeneficiary's birthday in the calendar year of the
spousebeneficiary's death, reduced by one for each subsequent calendar year.
(Ciii) If the Participant's surviving spouse is not the Participant's
sole designated beneficiary, the designated beneficiary's remaining life expectancy is calculated
using the age of the beneficiary in the year following the year of the Participant's death, reduced
by one for each subsequent year. Provided, however, if the Participant dies on or before December
31, 2019, the minimum amount distributed for each distribution calendar year shall be determined
by dividing the Participant’s account balance by the lesser of sixty (60) months or the designated
beneficiary’s remaining life expectancy.

dividing the Participant’s account balance by ten years.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan, all distributions required under this

No Designated Beneficiary. If the Participant dies on or after the date

distributions begin and there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year after the
year of the Participant's death, the minimum amount that will be distributed for each distribution

the limitations under this Section 7.6(f)(1)(B) shall apply to distributions to the beneficiary of the
Participant’s designated beneficiary (i.e., must be paid within ten years after the death of such

(C)

If there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Eligible Designated

Beneficiary is the Participant’s minor child (as of the Participant's date of death) and such
child is still living when he or she attains the age of majority, payment of the remaining
interest shall be made no later than ten years after such Eligible Designated Beneficiary
attains his or her applicable age of majority.

Also notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Participant's beneficiary

is an “applicable multi-beneficiary trust” (as defined below) required minimum
distributions after the Participant's death are determined as follows:
(A)

If the trust is to be divided immediately upon the death of

the Participant into separate trusts for each beneficiary, then the exception to the ten-year
rule described above, which allows for distribution over the life of an Eligible Designated
Beneficiary shall be applied separately with respect to the portion of the Participant's
Account that is payable to the designated beneficiary who is an Eligible Designated
Beneficiary because he or she is disabled or is a chronically ill individual, and the tenyear rule, not the exception, shall apply to the other Designated beneficiaries.

THIS DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN is made and entered into by and between

NAME AND PURPOSE OF PLAN
The Employer does hereby adopt the RTD Salaried Employees’ Defined

purpose of providing retirement benefits for its employees who qualify as participants and their
beneficiaries. The Plan is created for the exclusive benefit of the Employer's eligible employees

CONTRIBUTIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON ALLOCATIONS
Section 4.1 -- Employer Contributions.
The Employer shall contribute and pay into the Trust Fund for each Plan Year to
the credit of the Account of each Participant eligible to receive the contribution for such Plan
Year, an amount determined in the sole and absolute discretion of the Employer, which shall not
be less than seven percent (7.0%) or greater than nine percent (9.0%) of each Participant's
Compensation for such Plan Year. Subject to the requirements in Section 4.2, the Employer shall
make payment of its contributions to the Trust Fund each pay period, with respect to the
Participants’ respective Compensation in such pay period. Such contributions shall be made in
cash.
Section 4.2 -- Eligibility to Participate in Employer Contributions.
A Participant shall participate in the allocation of the contribution of the Employer
for any Plan Year if such Participant is credited with a Year of Service in such Plan Year.
Provided, however, a non-vested Participant who is terminated on the day prior to his or her
Employment Anniversary Date shall forfeit the Employer Contributions allocated to the
Participant’s account for such year together with the earnings thereon. For purposes of clarity, a
fully vested Participant who is terminated before being credited with a Year of Service in the Plan
Year of his or her separation from service shall retain the Employer Contributions allocated to the
Participants account for such year together with the earnings thereon.
Section 4.3 -- Return of Employer Contributions.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Article X below, a contribution made by the
Employer may be returned to the Employer if the contribution is made by reason of a mistake of
fact. The amount which may be returned to the Employer is the excess of (i) the amount
contributed over (ii) the amount that would have been contributed had there not occurred a mistake

of fact. The return to the Employer of the amount involved must be made within one year of the
mistaken payment of the contribution.
Section 4.4 -- Limitations on Allocations.
(a)

General Rule. In no event may a Participant receive an allocation for any

Limitation Year which, when combined with his or her allocation under any other defined
contribution plan maintained by the Employer, exceeds the lesser of (i) $58,000, as adjusted for
increases in the cost-of-living under Code Section 415(d), or (ii) one hundred percent (100%) of
such Participant's Compensation for the Limitation Year. If there is a short Limitation Year
because of a change in Limitation Year, the Plan shall multiply the $58,000 limitation (as adjusted)
by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months in the short Limitation Year and
denominator of which is twelve.
(b)

Allocations. For the purpose of applying the limitations of this Section, the

allocation to the Participant shall include the following amounts allocated to the account of a
Participant for a Limitation Year: (i) Employer Contributions, and (ii) forfeitures. For the purpose
of applying the limitations of this Section, compensation from, and allocations received under any
retirement plan maintained by, any other employer which is a common member with the Employer
of a controlled group, as prescribed by law or regulation, shall be counted. Allocations shall not
include restorative payments made to restore losses to the Plan resulting from actions by a fiduciary
for which there is a reasonable risk of liability for breach of fiduciary duty under applicable
Colorado law, where participants who are similarly situated are treated similarly with respect to
the payments.
(c)

Treatment of Excess. For the purposes of this paragraph (c), the term

"Excess Amount" shall mean the excess, if any, of the Participant's allocations for a Plan Year
over the maximum permissible amount set forth above in paragraph (a) of this Section 4.4.
If there is an Excess Amount with respect to a Participant for a Plan Year beginning
on or after July 1, 2007, the Board of Trustees will correct such Excess Amount in accordance

Procedure 2006-27 or any superseding guidance, including, but not limited to, the preamble of the
final Treasury Regulations under Code Section 415.
If there is an Excess Amount with respect to a Participant for any Plan Year
beginning before July 1, 2007, such excess shall be held in a suspense account until such amount
can be applied to reduce the next contribution of the Employer.

Section 4.5 -- Contributions for Periods of Qualified Military Service.
The Employer shall make all contributions to the Plan required by Code Section
414(u) which are attributable to periods of Qualified Military Service. The Employer shall make
up any Employer contributions the Employer would have made and which would have been
allocated to the Participant’s account had the Participant remained employed by the Employer
during the period of Qualified Military Service. For purposes of applying any Plan allocation
conditions under Section 4.2, any period of Qualified Military Service shall be credited as
equivalent Hours of Service. Any contributions made under this Subsection shall be subject to
the provisions of Code Section 414(u) and the provisions of this Plan shall be applied considering
any such contributions as having been made during the Plan Year to which the contributions
relate. For the purposes of this Section, "Qualified Military Service" means service in the
Uniformed Services of the United States (as defined in Chapter 43 of Title 38, United States Code)

DETERMINATION AND VESTING OF PARTICIPANTS' ACCOUNTS
Section 5.1 -- Allocation of Employer Contributions.
The contributions made by the Employer to the credit of the Account of each
Participant eligible to participate in the allocation of the Employer's contribution, as determined
under Section 4.2, shall be allocated to the Account of each such Participant. Such allocations
shall be subject to the limitations set forth in Section 4.4 above.
Section 5.2 -- Allocation of Earnings, Losses and Expenses of the Trust Fund.
(a)

General Rule. Investments of the Trust Fund shall be valued on each

business day. On each daily valuation date, there shall be allocated to the respective Accounts of
each Participant the proportionate share of the increase or decrease in the fair market value of the
Participant's accounts in each of the investments, based on the beginning balance of each such
Account for such day. The recordkeeper for the Plan may determine the increase or decrease in
the fair market value of the Participants' Accounts in each of the investments on a cash, share or
unit accounting basis. Whenever an event requires a determination of the value of a Participant's
Account, the value shall be computed as of the daily valuation date coincident with or following
the date of the event. Expenses allocated to the Trust Fund by the Trustees shall be allocated to
individual Participant Accounts pro rata based upon the value of the Participants’ respective
Accounts on the day of such allocation of expenses.
(b)

Forfeiture Suspense Accounts. If a Suspense Account is in existence at any

time during the Plan Year pursuant Section 5.6, such Suspense Account shall participate in the
allocation of the Trust's investment gains and losses during such Plan Year, in accordance with
paragraph (a) of this Section.

Section 5.3 -- Establishment and Maintenance of Participant Accounts.
The Trustees shall establish and maintain for each Participant a separate Account,
the balance of which shall represent the value of Employer contributions allocated on behalf of
such Participant, and any gains, losses, earnings and adjustments attributable thereto.
Section 5.4 -- Valuation of Accounts.
The Trustees shall determine, or cause the financial institution holding Trust Fund
investments to determine, the value of the Participants’ Accounts on a daily basis. In the event
that distribution is made to a Participant, the valuation of such Participant's Account shall occur
as of the day prior to such distribution, plus any contributions allocated to the Participant's
Account after such date.
Section 5.5 -- Vesting of Participants' Accounts.
Participants shall become vested in their respective Accounts in accordance with the
following schedule:

Notwithstanding the foregoing vesting schedule, each Participant’s Accounts shall
become 100% vested and nonforfeitable upon the Participant’s death, total disability, or Normal
Retirement Date, regardless of the number of Years of Service credited to the Participant.
Section 5.6 -- Forfeitures.
If a Participant (i) incurs a Break in Service or (ii) is less than one hundred percent
(100%) vested in accordance with Section 5.5 at the time of the Participant's separation from
service, then the non-vested portion of the Participant's Account shall be credited to a Suspense
Account, established and maintained by the Trustees in the Participant's name, to be dealt with as
described in Subsections (a), (b) and (c) below, depending upon whether or not the Participant
incurs a Permanent Break in Service. However, if an Employee’s participation in the Plan begins
after August 1, 2019, the following paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) will not apply to such Employee
because the One-Year Break in Service will become a Permanent Break in Service, and the balance
of the Participant’s Account will be forfeited, subject to paragraph 5.6(d). In addition, if a
Participant who has incurred a Permanent Break in Service is re-employed by the Employer, the
Participant shall not be credited with any Years of Service with respect to his or her prior service.
(a)

Participant Incurs Permanent Break in Service. If the Participant incurs a

Permanent Break in Service, then the credit balance to such Suspense Account shall, subject to the
provisions of Section 5.6 hereof, be a forfeiture. If a Participant who has incurred a Permanent
Break in Service is re-employed by the Employer, the Participant shall not be credited with any
Years of Service with respect to his or her prior service.
(b)

Participant Does Not Incur Permanent Break in Service. If the Participant

does not incur a Permanent Break in Service, then the credit balance to such Suspense Account
shall be transferred back to the Participant’s reconstituted Account after the first Plan Year for
which the Participant is credited with a Year of Service, and the Participant may fully restore his
or her Account by making the payment specified in paragraph (c) of this Section, if applicable.
However, effective August 1, 2019, by action of the Board of Trustees, the Participant’s Suspense
Account may be forfeited for those Participants who have a Suspense Account. For those

Participants who have a Suspense Account, if there has been a distribution pursuant to
Section 7.3(d) and the Participant returns to employment before five (5) years from their
termination of employment, then the Employer will restore their Suspense Account, and the
pertinent provisions of 5.6(a), (b) and (c) will apply.
(c)

Restoration of Participant’s Account. If a Participant has received a

distribution of his or her Account, and then is subsequently re-employed before incurring a
Permanent Break in Service, the Participant may repay 100% of the distribution amount received
from his or her Account to the Plan so long as such payment is made prior to the date the amount
previously distributed to him or her incurs a tax. Such repayment must be made on or before the
last day of the period beginning with the first day the Participant is subsequently re-employed, and
ending 180 days thereafter. Upon such repayment, a Participant's Account shall consist of the
amount repaid.
(d)

Use of Forfeiture Account. The aggregate amount of any forfeitures arising

during a Plan Year shall first be used to offset expenses of the Plan. Any forfeitures remaining at
the end of the Plan Year in excess of $100,000.00 shall be allocated to reduce the Employer
Contributions.
Section 5.7 -- Leaves of Absence; Military Service.
A leave of absence granted by the Employer for purposes other than military service
shall not be considered as a Break in Service or a separation from service.
Any employee or Participant who has entered or enters the Armed Forces of the
United States shall be presumed to be on a leave of absence, regardless of the length of such
service, and such leave of absence shall not be considered as a Break in Service or a separation
from service, provided he or she returns to the employ of the Employer within ninety (90) days of
the date on which he or she shall have the right to release from military service or from the hospital
in the event of service-caused disability, without intervening employment elsewhere.

In the case of a death occurring on or after January 1, 2007, if a Participant dies
while performing qualified military service (as defined in Code Section 414(u)), the Participant's
Beneficiary is entitled to any additional benefits (other than benefit accruals relating to the period
of qualified military service) provided under the Plan as if the Participant had resumed
employment and then terminated employment on account of death. Moreover, the Plan will credit
the Participant's qualified military service as service for vesting purposes, as though the Participant
had resumed employment under USERRA immediately prior to the Participant's death.
Section 5.8 -- Vesting Upon Termination or Partial Termination of Plan or
Discontinuance of Contributions to the Plan.
Upon the termination or partial termination of the Plan or the complete
discontinuance of contributions under the Plan to the Trust, the interests of all affected Participants
shall become fully and completely vested and nonforfeitable.

(a)

Designation of Beneficiaries. A Participant shall have the right to designate

a beneficiary or beneficiaries and one or more contingent beneficiaries to receive his or her interest
in the Trust Fund upon his or her death, such designation to be made on the form prescribed by
and delivered to the Plan Administrator. The Participant shall have the right to change or revoke

the Plan Administrator, and no notice to any beneficiary nor consent by any beneficiary shall be
required to effect any such change or revocation.
(b)

Determination of Beneficiary When There is no Designated Beneficiary. If

a Participant shall fail to designate a beneficiary before his or her death, or if all designated
beneficiaries or contingent beneficiaries should die, cease to exist or disclaim their interests prior
to distribution, the Plan Administrator shall direct the payment of the Participant’s Vested
Account to his or her surviving spouse, if any, or if none, then to the personal representative of
his or her estate. If, however, no personal representative shall have been appointed, and the actual
notice thereof given to the Plan Administrator within one hundred twenty (120) days after his or

Death of Participant Before Distributions Begin. If the Participant dies

before distributions begin, the Participant's Account will be distributed, or begin to be distributed,
no later than as follows:
(1)

If the Participant's surviving spouse is the Participant's sole designated

beneficiary, then distributions to the surviving spouse will begin by December 31 of the calendar
year immediately following the calendar year in which the Participant died, or by December 31
of the calendar year in which the Participant would have attained age 70 1/2, or age seventy-two
(72) for a Participant turning 70-1/2 after December 31, 2019, if later.
(2)

If the Participant's surviving spouse is not the Participant's sole designated

beneficiary, then distributions to the designated beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the
calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the Participant died.
(3)

If there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year

following the year of the Participant's death, the Participant's Account will be distributed by
December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the Participant's death.
(4)

If the Participant's surviving spouse is the Participant's sole designated

beneficiary and the surviving spouse dies after the Participant but before distributions to the
surviving spouse begin, this Section 7.6(b), other than Section 7.6(b)(1), will apply as if the
surviving spouse were the Participant.
(5)

For purposes of this Section 7.6(b) and Section 7.6(d), unless Section

7.6(b)(4) applies, distributions are considered to begin on the Participant's required beginning
date. If Section 7.6(b)(4) applies, distributions are considered to begin on the date distributions
are required to begin to the surviving spouse under Section 7.6(b)(1).

Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan, all distributions required under
this Section 7.6 shall be paid to the Participant or the Participant’s Beneficiary in a lump sum.
(c)

Required Minimum Distributions During Participant's Lifetime. During the

Participant's lifetime, the minimum amount that will be distributed for each distribution calendar
year is the lesser of:
(1)

the quotient obtained by dividing the Participant's account balance by the

distribution period in the Uniform Lifetime Table set forth in Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the
Treasury Regulations, using the Participant's age as of the Participant's birthday in the distribution
calendar year; or

if the Participant's sole designated beneficiary for the distribution calendar

year is the Participant's spouse, the quotient obtained by dividing the Participant's account balance
by the number in the Joint and Last Survivor Table set forth in Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the
Treasury Regulations, using the Participant's and spouse's attained ages as of the Participant's and
spouse's birthdays in the distribution calendar year.

(A)

Participant Survived by Designated Beneficiary. If the Participant

dies on or after the date distributions begin and there is a designated beneficiary, the minimum
amount that will be distributed for each distribution calendar year after the year of the Participant's
death is the quotient obtained by dividing the Participant's account balance by the longer of the
remaining life expectancy of the Participant or the remaining life expectancy of the Participant's
designated beneficiary, determined as follows:
(i)

The Participant's remaining life expectancy is calculated

using the age of the Participant in the year of death, reduced by one for each subsequent year.
(ii)

If the Participant's surviving spouse is the Participant's sole

designated beneficiary, or if the Participant dies after December 31, 2019, an “Eligible Designated
Beneficiary” (as defined in Code Section 401(a)(9)(E)(ii) and determined as of the date of the
Participant’s death), the remaining life expectancy of the beneficiary is calculated for each
distribution calendar year after the year of the Participant's death using the beneficiary’s age as of
the beneficiary’s birthday in that year. For distribution calendar years after the year of the
beneficiary’s death, the remaining life expectancy of the beneficiary is calculated using the age
of the beneficiary as of the beneficiary's birthday in the calendar year of the beneficiary's death,
reduced by one for each subsequent calendar year.
(iii)

If the Participant's surviving spouse is not the Participant's

sole designated beneficiary, the designated beneficiary's remaining life expectancy is calculated
using the age of the beneficiary in the year following the year of the Participant's death, reduced
by one for each subsequent year. Provided, however, if the Participant dies on or before December
31, 2019, the minimum amount distributed for each distribution calendar year shall be determined
by dividing the Participant’s account balance by the lesser of sixty (60) months or the designated
beneficiary’s remaining life expectancy.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Participant dies after December 31, 2019, and if the
designated beneficiary is an individual who is not an Eligible Designated Beneficiary (as defined

dividing the Participant’s account balance by ten years.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan, all distributions required under this
Section 7.6 shall be paid to the Participant or the Participant’s Beneficiary in a lump sum.
(B)

No Designated Beneficiary. If the Participant dies on or after the date

distributions begin and there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year after the
year of the Participant's death, the minimum amount that will be distributed for each distribution
calendar year after the year of the Participant's death is the quotient obtained by dividing the
Participant's account balance by the Participant's remaining life expectancy calculated using the
age of the Participant in the year of death, reduced by one for each subsequent year.
(e)

Death Before Date Distributions Begin.

(1)

Participant Survived by Designated Beneficiary. If the Participant dies

before the date distributions begin and there is a designated beneficiary, the minimum
amount that will be distributed for each distribution calendar year after the year of the
Participant's death is the quotient obtained by dividing the Participant's account balance
by the remaining life expectancy of the Participant's designated beneficiary, determined
as provided in Section 7.6(d)(1).
(2)

No Designated Beneficiary.

If the Participant dies before the date

distributions begin and there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year
following the year of the Participant's death, distribution of the Participant's Account will
be completed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the
Participant's death.

Death of Surviving Spouse Before Distributions to Surviving Spouse Are

Required to Begin.

If the Participant dies before the date distributions begin, the

Participant's surviving spouse is the Participant's sole designated beneficiary, and the

Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan, all distributions required under
this Section 7.6 shall be paid to the Participant or the Participant’s Beneficiary in a lump sum.
(f)

Distributions for Deaths After December 31, 2019.

(1)

Notwithstanding the foregoing, and solely for distributions with respect to

Participants who die after December 31, 2019, and before distributions of their entire interest
(whether or not distributions had begun before the Participant’s death):
(A)

The Participant’s entire interest shall be distributed to the

“designated beneficiary” (as defined in 7.6(g), below)) no later than December 31 of the calendar
year containing the tenth anniversary of the Participant’s death; provided that, a designated
beneficiary who is an Eligible Designated Beneficiary (as defined in Code Section
401(a)(9)(E)(ii)) may receive distribution over the life of such Eligible Designated Beneficiary in
accordance with Section 7.6(d)(1)(A) (regardless of whether the Participant died before or after
the Participant’s required beginning date), in which case, distributions to the Eligible Designated
Beneficiary will begin no later than December 31 of the calendar year following the calendar year
of the Participant's death or, if the Eligible Designated Beneficiary is the Participant’s surviving
Spouse, distributions will begin in accordance with Section 7.6(b), above.
(B)

If an Eligible Designated Beneficiary dies before receipt of the

entire interest payable to the Eligible Designated Beneficiary, payment of the remaining interest
shall be made within ten years after the death of such Eligible Designated Beneficiary. For the
purpose of applying this Section 7.6(f)(1)(B), a designated beneficiary of a Participant who died
prior to January 1, 2020, shall also be treated as an Eligible Designated Beneficiary. Accordingly,
the limitations under this Section 7.6(f)(1)(B) shall apply to distributions to the beneficiary of the
Participant’s designated beneficiary (i.e., must be paid within ten years after the death of such
designated beneficiary); and

child is still living when he or she attains the age of majority, payment of the remaining
interest shall be made no later than ten years after such Eligible Designated Beneficiary
attains his or her applicable age of majority.

Also notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Participant's beneficiary

is an “applicable multi-beneficiary trust” (as defined below) required minimum
distributions after the Participant's death are determined as follows:

If the trust is to be divided immediately upon the death of

the Participant into separate trusts for each beneficiary, then the exception to the ten-year
rule described above, which allows for distribution over the life of an Eligible Designated
Beneficiary shall be applied separately with respect to the portion of the Participant's
Account that is payable to the designated beneficiary who is an Eligible Designated
Beneficiary because he or she is disabled or is a chronically ill individual, and the tenyear rule, not the exception, shall apply to the other Designated beneficiaries.
(B)

If, instead, no individual (other than a designated

beneficiary who is an Eligible Designated Beneficiary because he or she is disabled or is
a chronically ill individual) has any right to the Participant's Account under the Plan until
the death of all such Eligible Designated Beneficiaries with respect to the trust, then the
exception to the ten-year rule described above, which allows for distribution over the life
of an Eligible Designated Beneficiary shall apply to the trust until the death of all such
Eligible Designated Beneficiaries with respect to the trust. After the death of the last

surviving such Eligible Designated Beneficiary, the ten-year rule, not the exception, shall
apply to the other designated beneficiaries, who, upon the death of such individual, shall
be treated as Beneficiaries of the Eligible Designated Beneficiary.
(C)

For this purpose, an “applicable multi-beneficiary trust”

means a trust which has more than one beneficiary, all of the beneficiaries of which are
Designated beneficiaries, and at least one of the beneficiaries of which is an Eligible
Designated Beneficiary because he or she is disabled or is a chronically ill individual.

The provisions of this Section 7.6 are intended to comply with Section 401

of the SECURE Act (Division O of the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 (Public
Law 116-94)) and shall be applied in accordance with such section and regulatory guidance issued

interest, distribution of the remainder of the Participant’s Vested Account shall be made to the
next contingent Beneficiary. In the event there is not a Beneficiary or contingent Beneficiary
designated by the Participant to receive distribution of the Participant’s Vested Account, the
Participant’s Vested Account shall be distributed in a manner determined pursuant to Section 7.6

dissolution of marriage/civil union, legal separation or declaration of invalidity of marriage if
such agreement meets the requirements of Colorado Revised Statutes Section 14-110-113(6) and

ARTICLE IX
TRANSFERS BETWEEN ELIGIBLE PLANS
Section 9.1 -- Transfers Out of the Plan.
The Trustees are also authorized, at the request of the Participant, to transfer such
Participant's Vested Account which has become distributable under Article VII hereof, directly to
an Eligible Retirement Plan, as defined below, for the benefit of such Participant, provided such
transfer satisfies the requirements under law for such transfers.
In the event of the death of a Participant prior to the distribution of the Participant’s
Vested Account, the Participants Beneficiary may transfer such deceased Participant's Vested
Account directly to another Eligible Retirement Plan for the benefit of such Beneficiary, provided
such transfer satisfies the requirements under law for such transfers.
Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary that would otherwise
limit a Distributee's election under this Section, a Distributee may elect, at the time and in the
manner prescribed by the Trustees, to have any portion of an Eligible Rollover Distribution paid
directly to an Eligible Retirement Plan specified by the Distributee in a direct rollover.
Section 9.2 -- Definitions for Article IX.
(a)

“Eligible Rollover Distribution”. An Eligible Rollover Distribution is any

distribution of all or any portion of a Participant’s Vested Account in the Plan, except an eligible
rollover distribution does not include: (a) any distribution which is one of a series of substantially
equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy)
of the Participant or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the Participant and the Participant's
Beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten years or more; (b) any Code Section 401(a)(9) required
minimum distribution; (c) the portion of any distribution which is not includible in gross income;
(d) any hardship distribution; and (e) any distribution which otherwise would be an eligible

rollover distribution under the Code, but where the total distributions to the Participant during that
calendar year are reasonably expected to be less than $200.
(b)

“Eligible Retirement Plan”. An Eligible Retirement Plan is an individual

retirement account described in Code Section 408(a), an individual retirement annuity described
in Code Section 408(b), a Roth IRA described in IRS Code Section 408A (subject to applicable
income tax requirements), an annuity plan described in Code Section 403(a), a qualified trust
described in Code Section 401(a) that accepts the Distributee’s Eligible Rollover Distribution, an
annuity contract described in Code Section 403(b) or an eligible plan under Code Section 457(b)
which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of
a state or political subdivision of a state, but only if such plan agrees to separately account for
amounts transferred from this Plan. The definition of Eligible Retirement Plan in the previous
sentence shall also apply in the case of a distribution to a surviving spouse, or to a spouse or former
spouse who is the alternate payee under a domestic relations order, as defined in Colorado Revised
Statutes Section 14-10-113(6). In the case of a distribution to a Beneficiary other than a spouse or
former spouse of a Participant, an Eligible Retirement Plan shall only be an individual retirement
account described in Code Section 408(a) or an individual retirement annuity described in Code
Section 408(b) that is treated as an inherited IRA in accordance with the provisions of Code Section
402(c)(11).
(c)

Beneficiary, and a Participant's spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee under a
domestic relations order, as defined in Colorado Revised Statutes Section 14-10-113(6) with
regard to the interest of the spouse or former spouse.
(d)

“Direct Rollover”. A direct rollover is a payment by the Plan to the eligible

retirement plan specified by the Distributee.

ARTICLE X
CONTINUANCE, TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT OF PLAN
Section 10.1 -- Continuance of Plan by Successor Government.
A successor government may continue this Plan by proper action of its legislative

Income Security Act of 1974.
Section 11.2 -- Benefits to be Provided Solely from the Trust Fund.

Section 11.5 -- Text to Control.
The headings of Articles and Sections are included solely for convenience of
reference. If there shall be any conflict between such headings and the text of this Plan, the text
shall control.
Section 11.6 -- Law Governing and Severability.
This Plan Agreement shall be construed, regulated and administered under the laws
of the State of Colorado. All contributions received by the Trustees hereunder shall be deemed to
have been received in that state. In the event any provision of this Plan and the Trust Agreement
shall be held illegal or invalid for any reason, said illegality or invalidity shall not affect the
remaining provisions hereof. On the contrary, such remaining provisions shall be fully severable
and this Plan Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if said illegal or invalid provisions
had never been inserted herein.
Section 11.7 -- Employer's Obligations.
The adoption and continuance of the Plan shall not be deemed to constitute a
contract between the Employer and any employee or Participant, nor to be a consideration for, or
an inducement or condition of, the employment of any person. Without limiting the foregoing
sentence, the Employer Contributions provided under the Plan shall not be deemed to give rise to
a contractual obligation of the Employer to make the same amount of Employer Contributions in
future Plan Years. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to give any employee or Participant
the right to be retained in the employ of the Employer or to interfere with the right of the Employer
to discharge any employee or Participant at any time, nor shall it be deemed to give the Employer
the right to require the employee or Participant to remain in its employ nor shall it interfere with
the right of any employee or Participant to terminate his or her employment at any time.

The Employer shall not incur any liability whatsoever to the Trust Fund, or any
Participants or their beneficiaries, or the Trustees, or any other person for anything done or
omitted by the Trustees or for the loss or depreciation, in whole or in part, of the Trust Fund.
Section 11.8 -- Plan for Exclusive Benefit of Participants; Reversion Prohibited.
This Plan has been entered into for the exclusive benefit of the Participants and
their beneficiaries. Under no circumstances shall any funds contributed to or held by the Trustees
hereunder at any time revert to or be used by or enjoyed by the Employer nor shall any such funds
or assets at any time be used other than for the exclusive benefit of the Participants or their
beneficiaries, subject to the provisions concerning the return of certain Employer contributions.
Section 11.9 -- Use of the Term "Spouse."
Whenever the term spouse is used in this Plan, it should be construed as though it
includes both a party who is married to a Participant pursuant to the provisions of the "Uniform
Marriage Act", Colorado Revised Statutes Section 14-2-101, et. seq., as well as include a party to
a civil union pursuant to Colorado Revised Statutes Section 14-15-101, et. seq. However, in
situations where the Code has a different definition of spouse in sections pertaining to
qualification or operation of governmental plans, the definition of spouse, as stated in the Code,
shall control.
