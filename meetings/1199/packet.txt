Board Meeting Date: August 6, 2013

Subject:

Donation of Vintage Rail

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager and/or his designee to donate vintage rail, tie plates and wooden ties for
restoration purposes to Como Depot.
BACKGROUND
The vintage rail is located in a land locked area between Evans and East Asbury Avenue. The adjacent
properties include high density housing, storage units and a paint distribution store. The existing rail is a
mix of narrow gauge 80-90 pound connected to wooden ties with plates and steel spikes. RTD has
never or will ever use this weight of rail or our existing light rail service. With no long term plan for
restoration or use, a constrained budget, the opportunity for removal and re-use was considered in the
fall of 2012.
In summer of 2012, RTD was contacted by the Como Depot stating their desire to remove the rail,
wooden ties and plates, restore and reuse them in a historical round house located in Como, Colorado.
The Como Depot, a non-profit historic organization, is in process of refurbishing the historic roundhouse
and hotel which dates back to 1879. Como Depot has partnered with several entities which include
CDOT, State Historical Fund, Colorado Preservation, Denver South Park and Pacific Historical Society,
Park County and South Park National Heritage Area.
Pursuant to receiving this letter, RTD staff recommended to the Board of Directors that the vintage rail,
tie plates and wooden ties be donated to Como Depot. RTD staff developed an advertisement method,
described below under Discussion, and compiled a historical report which is attached.
DISCUSSION
The contracting method for transfer of the vintage rail and components was a Request for Expression of
Interest and Information (REFII). REFII No. 13JB008 was issued on 05/25/2013 and copies of the REFII
were provided to 15 prospective vendors in addition to being advertised with the Denver News Agency.
The vendor list was:
Como Depot
SRC Industries, Inc.
Railroad Specialties
United Railroad Service Co.
North American Rail Products
Pikes Peak Historical
Littleton Museum
Colorado History
Lakewood Historical Society
Colorado Historical Foundation
Arvada Historical Society

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

Jefferson County Historical
Forney Transportation Museum
Colorado Railroad Museum
Advertisement was closed on 06/12/2013 with two proposals received, one from Como Depot and SRC
Industries, Inc.
On 06/24/2013 the RTD project team met and discussed the following:
•
•
•
•

Como Depot more than qualifies them for the project of the Buchtel Vintage Rail, Tie Plate and
Wooden Tie Removal.
Como Depot is willing to accept all aspects listed in the REFII 13HJB008 for the removal of the
vintage rail.
Como Depot funding will rely on donations and volunteers for all aspects of the REFII.
Como Depot partners include State Historical Fund, CDOT, Colorado Preservation, Denver South
Park and Pacific Historical Society, Park County, South Park National Heritage Area, with others
contributing their time and funds for the Depot restoration.

The contract for ownership transfer would be zero dollars, this proposal, if accepted would result in no
expenses for RTD. RTD will not receive any funds in return for these vintage rails, tie plates and
wooden ties.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
No impact to RTD’s current or future budgets.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee
that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager and/or his designee to donate vintage rail,
tie plates and wooden ties for restoration purposes to Como Depot.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager and/or his designee
to donate vintage rails, tie plates and wooden ties to Como Depot. Instead, leave the property as is
and do not disturb the vintage rails, tie plates and wooden ties. This alternative is not recommended
as RTD has no long-term plan or budget for restoration or reuse of these items.

RTD Real Property White Paper

Introduction
The intent of this white paper is to describe the real property management and disposition process at
RTD including how real property management interfaces with the TOD function at RTD. This white
paper outlines all existing RTD, state and federal regulations that govern RTD’s acquisition and
disposition of real property and identifies other policy (including TOD) and operational considerations
that need to be taken into account in this process. Also, this paper summarizes how other similar public
agencies approach real property management. Finally, this paper identifies some steps RTD may
consider to more proactively manage its real property assets.

Regulations Governing RTD Real Property
There are several state, federal and RTD laws, regulations and policies which govern the acquisitions and
disposition of properties. RTD must maintain compliance with these requirements.
RTD’s legal authority to acquire property is established in Colorado Revised Statutes C.R.S. 32-9-101 et
seq. “Regional Transportation Act” as amended. This legislation empowers the Board to acquire,
manage, and dispose of property in furtherance of the authorization of planning, building, operating and
maintaining a mass transportation system. This authority includes the power to condemn property for
public use. It is important to note that the authority granted to RTD by the state specifically defines
that RTD can only acquire property for the purposes of mass transit. Different regulations apply to the
disposition of property acquired by RTD depending on the funding source. The disposition of properties
acquired with local funding only are subject to the legal authority above and the Regional
Transportation District Resolution No. 10 Series of 1984 (Resolution Regarding Joint Development and
Disposition of Property Rights) attached as Exhibit A. Disposition of property requires RTD Board
approval.
The acquisition and disposition of property acquired by RTD for federally assisted programs and projects
are subject to acquisition and relocation policies and provisions contained in the government-wide rule
published in the Federal Register on January 4, 2005. The rules are reprinted each year in the Code of
Federal Regulations (CFR), Title 49, Part 24. All Federal, State, local government agencies, and others
receiving Federal financial assistance for public programs and projects that require the acquisition of
real property must comply with the policies and provisions set forth in the Uniform Act and the
regulation. The acquisition itself does not need to be federally funded for the rules to apply. If Federal
funds are used in any phase of the program or project, the rules of the Uniform Act apply.

April 3, 2013

In addition to the Uniform Act, the Federal Transit Administration requires Grantees to be familiar with
other regulations that specifically address the disposition of property, especially U.S. Department of
Transportation, Federal Transit Administration Circular FTA C 5010.1D Grant Management Requirements
dated November 1, 2008, Rev 1, August 27, 2012. The Circular establishes procedures to be followed by
grantees for the disposition of properties, including (1.) selling property (competitively to the extent
practicable) and reimbursing FTA its share of the fair market value, and (2) selling real property and
using the proceeds to reduce the cost of the grant if it is still open or of other FTA funded capital
projects.
A list of properties, vacant and/or underutilized originally acquired without federal funding assistance is
attached as Exhibit B and a list of properties, vacant and/or underutilized originally acquired as part of a
federally funded project is attached as Exhibit C.
As a general rule, property acquired for a construction project is not considered for disposition until
after the construction contract is complete. RTD construction contracts generally make property
acquired for the project available to the construction contractor for construction installation, access to
the site or storage.

Other Policy and Operational Considerations for RTD Real Property Management
There are multiple additional policy and operational considerations that need to be evaluated in the
context of the management, acquisition and disposition of RTD real property. These considerations
should be evaluated in the context of overriding rules and regulations on real property discussed in the
previous section.
Key considerations beyond the existing regulations that govern real property management include:


Financial – management decisions including the acquisition, disposition or transfer of some
other form of property rights are influenced by the general financial conditions of the district
and the financial status of individual capital improvement projects. Examples of this kind of
influence include:
o RTD’s Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM) – the RTD Board approved the potential to sell
selected excess properties for the purpose of adding revenues to the FasTracks Internal
Savings Account (FISA). This consideration requires RTD staff to look proactively at
selling selected parcels no longer needed for transit purposes to raise revenues to pay
for FasTracks related improvements.
o Engineering decisions on capital improvement projects – financial considerations are
taken into account in acquisition of property for RTD facilities. Budget limitations on
projects often require creative thinking and design to minimize or avoid acquiring
property for RTD rail and bus facilities. RTD staff work very hard to take only property
that is absolutely required for construction and operation of RTD facilities.

1.C.1.b

o

o

Fair Market Value – RTD establishes the value of a property for disposal through a fair
market appraisal. An offer significantly below the appraised fair market value would not
be approved.
Certificates of Participation (COPs) – COPs are used frequently by RTD to leverage
existing RTD assets, including property, for the purposes of financing other RTD
obligations such as capital improvements. The utilization of COPs on RTD real property
must be considered since the disposition of property which is encumbered by a COP will
require that the COP obligation be paid off or transferred to another RTD asset.



Current and Future Operational Needs – RTD’s current and future operational needs are always
evaluated in RTD’s property management process. There are some parcels in RTD’s property
inventory that are underutilized and/or are no longer required for its original intended purpose.
In these situations, it is incumbent on RTD staff to evaluate not only the current utilization of the
property, but the potential for future RTD use. This is extremely important because disposing of
property should only be done in cases where there is no foreseeable transit need for the
property. RTD does not want to be in the situation where it sells an underutilized property and
then determines two or three years later that it did need the property after all.



Transit Oriented Development Opportunities – the opportunity for TOD is an additional
consideration in the acquisition and disposition of property. First and foremost, RTD can only
purchase property for mass transit and cannot purchase property for development. That being
said, RTD does want to encourage the development of transit oriented communities around its
stations and does proactively look for partnership opportunities with local jurisdictions and
private developers to implement TOD at stations. Forming partnerships with others may allow
RTD to avoid acquiring property for RTD’s exclusive use. Examples of this type of partnership
include the Olde Town Arvada station and the Westminster station where the local jurisdictions
acquired property to promote the integration of RTD bus and parking facilities into a larger plan
for transit oriented development.
Additional consideration may be given to TOD in the land disposition process. When certain
conditions are present including local jurisdiction support and commitment for TOD
implementation (the presence of an adopted station area plan, TOD supportive zoning and
commitment of funding for public infrastructure) and private developer commitment and
resources (ownership of land and expenditure of resources on design and entitlements) RTD
may consider reinvesting land proceeds for the purposes of enhancing the station environment
through the implementation of TOD. Examples of this include the Boulder Junction bus transfer
facility and the Alameda TOD Pilot Project where the RTD Board chose to reinvest land sale
proceeds back into the transit facilities that are being built or being reconfigured associated
with the implementation of TOD.

1.C.1.b

A review of procedures of other public agencies, including General Services Administration (GSA),
Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT), Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA),
Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) and Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) and
various municipalities within the RTD district was done. All emphasize obtaining the fair market value,
as determined by appraisal of the property to be disposed of and most dispose of surplus property via a
competitive sale to the public generally through a sealed bid or auction. No marketing efforts are a part
of the disposition procedures.

Potential Modifications to RTD’s Real Property Management Approach
As RTD moves forward with the build out of FasTracks and the ongoing operation of its existing bus and
light rail system, modifications to RTD’s Real Property management could be considered. The
modifications would focus on being proactive where appropriate, but understanding that RTD is only in
the business of buying and selling real estate for constructing and operating a mass transit system.
RTD staff proposes the following steps in an effort to more proactively management its real property
assets:
1. Review and Refine Inventory of Surplus and Underutilized Property. Inventories of surplus and
underutilized real properties are attached. RTD staff will evaluate all properties contained in
either inventory, federally funded and/or locally funded and will focus on larger, possibly more
marketable parcels. Small/sliver parcels and other nonmarketable parcels will not be included
in the revised inventory.
2. Conduct an Assessment of Excess and Underutilized Real Property. RTD staff will form a
multidisciplinary committee to assess the potential disposition of parcels within the inventory of
surplus and underutilized parcels. In evaluating the inventory of parcels, RTD will consider all
the factors discussed in this white paper including regulations governing RTD property
disposition and other policy and operational considerations. Following the completion of this
evaluation, RTD staff will consult with select local subject matter experts to get their
perspectives on RTD’s real property inventory in the context of the factors governing RTD’s real
property disposition. RTD staff will then inform the Board of its assessment of the inventory of
parcels. If staff were to move forward with any property disposition, the RTD Board would have
to approve the final negotiated business terms unless the Board had previously delegated that
authority to the General Manager.
3. Develop a Marketing Plan for Select Surplus and Underutilized Property. RTD staff will also
determine if there is a need to market the surplus or underutilized property. Marketing efforts
could include the development of a Request for Proposals (RFP), the installation of for sale signs
on the property to be disposed of, communication with local commercial, industrial and/or
residential property brokers who sell property in the vicinity, or other efforts to be determined.
RTD staff does not feel it would be advantageous to hire a real estate broker to market

Packet Pg. 17

Attachment: Real Property White PaperFINALv3 (1646 : Real Property and TOD White Paper Update)

Peer Agency Approaches to Real Property Management

individual properties. Hiring a broker would reduce the amount of funds that RTD could receive
on the property because of the need to pay a commission to the broker. It would also require a
competitive solicitation each time a need for representation was identified, adding additional
time and cost to any disposition. In addition, none of the peer public agencies we surveyed
utilized a separate, private real estate broker in the disposition of real property.
4. Ongoing Process to Evaluate TOD Opportunities – RTD TOD staff will continue to proactively
pursue TOD opportunities where appropriate. As identified earlier, RTD will seek out
opportunities for partnerships with local jurisdictions and/or private developers where RTD can
leverage other resources to enhance our bus and rail stations and integrate transit more
seamlessly with development.
Other factors including market viability for TOD and
opportunities to encourage affordable housing as identified by RTD Board policy will also be
considered in the pursuit of TOD. When necessary, RTD staff will engage outside real estate
experts, on-call consultants and others to help evaluate TOD opportunities and negotiate with
private developers (RTD staff has utilized this approach for multiple projects including the DUS
Historic Building, the Alameda TOD Pilot and the Arvada TOD Pilot). RTD staff may engage
additional, outside experts on TOD under the following conditions:





The outside party has agreed to not compete or bid for the TOD opportunity for which
they are being consulted
Each individual TOD opportunity should be evaluated independently on a case by case
basis to determine the type of outside expertise needed since every project has unique
characteristics
Outside experts advising RTD should have a local understanding of the Denver real
estate market

Summary
In conclusion, the sale of surplus property can provide needed revenue to RTD and relieve the District of
the cost to maintain these properties. RTD will take additional steps to inventory, access and market
surplus properties. However, as described in this paper, the disposition of property is a complex
endeavor that must take into account legal, financial, contractual, and future operational requirements
while also considering transit oriented development opportunities where applicable. As we continue to
improve our processes in this area, we will schedule a study session to gather input from the RTD Board
on this very important item.

Disposition of Property Rights)

II.

RTD shall not dispose of any interest in any real property, including subsurface
rights, surface rights, air rights, leasehold rights, or any combination thereof (said
interests in real property being hereinafter referred to as “Property Rights”), until
RTD has determined that disposition of such Property Rights will not endanger or
interfere with the safe and efficient functioning of the RTD mass transportation
system.

III.

RTD will dispose of Property Rights only (a) by those means authorized by Regional
Transportation District Act (Colorado Revised Statutes 32-9-101 et. seq.) or (b) by
any other lawful means.

IV.

If RTD Property Rights are available for disposition, the General Manager or his
designee shall present a Disposition or Joint Development Plan to the Board of
Directors (“Board”) for approval. A Disposition or Joint Development Plan (“Plan”)
shall include the following information:

V.

(i)

A description of the Property Rights;

(ii)

The proposed method if disposition or development;

(iii)

A finding, with supporting facts, that (a) the Property Rights are no longer
required for mass transportation system construction, operation, or
maintenance or (b) use of the Property Rights by another party will not
interfere with RTD’s present or planned concurrent use;

(iv)

A properly documented professional analysis of the highest and best use of
the Property Rights;

(v)

The appraised fair market value of the Property Rights and, where a lease
disposition is proposed, the appraised fair market value of the Property
Rights, and where a lease disposition is proposed, the appraised fair rental
value and the proposed term of the lease;

(vi)

A description of applicable zoning regulations; and

(vii)

A description of local government land use and development plans affecting
future use of the Property Rights.

If the Board approves a Plan, the Board shall authorize the General Manager or his
designee to request, receive, and evaluate proposals for the sale, lease, or other
disposition or joint development of the Property Rights.

1.C.1.d

1.C.1.d

The General Manager shall submit to the Board his recommendations on the bids or
proposals received for the Property Rights. The Board may:
(i)

Accept a proposal for the sale, lease, or other disposition of RTD Property
Rights; or

(ii)

Reject any or all bids or proposals as necessary for the protection of the
interests of RTD and thereafter direct the General Manager to take such
actions as are deemed appropriate by the Board.

VII.

Any lease of Property Rights of a duration of a year or less must conform to the
policies enunciated in paragraphs I, II, III, VIII, and IX but need not be the subject of
a request for proposal and need not be submitted to the Board for approval. Any
grant of easement rights must also conform to paragraphs I, II, III, VIII, and IX but
need not be the subject of a request for proposals.

VIII.

In any disposition of Property Rights, other than outright sale, RTD shall retain
sufficient control over the development of the Property Rights to reasonably ensure
that no negative impact will result to RTD’s mass transportation system and to
reasonably ensure that the development does not detract from the aesthetic, social,
and economic wellbeing of the community.

IX.

In the event that a proposed disposition involves Property Rights that may be
needed in the future for mass transportation system purposes (including, without
limitation, expansion of the system), RTD shall retain such interest in and control
over such Property Rights as are necessary to ensure that such Property Rights
shall be available for RTD’s use when and as necessary for mass transportation
system purposes.

X.

The General Manager shall formulate appropriate administrative procedures to be
followed by the RTD staff in connection with the disposition or development of
Property Rights by sale, lease, or other methods.

Passed and adopted by the Board of Directors of the Regional Transportation District on
the 27th day of March, 1984.
