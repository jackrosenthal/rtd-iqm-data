("RTD")
RESOLUTION No. _____ SERIES OF 2020
APPOINTMENT OF TRUSTEE TO THE RTD SALARIED EMPLOYEES’ PENSION TRUST
AND RTD SALARIED EMPLOYEES’ DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN TRUST
Whereas, RTD maintains the RTD Salaried Employees' Pension Plan and Trust ("Pension Plan"
or "Pension Trust") for salaried employees hired by RTD before January 1, 2008 and the RTD Salaried
Employees' Defined Contribution Plan and Trust ("Defined Contribution Plan" or "Defined Contribution
Trust") for salaried employees hired on or after January 1, 2008, which may collectively be referred to
as the "Trusts"; and,
Whereas, two RTD Board Directors and five salaried employees serve as the same sets of
trustees for each of the above Trusts as further described below; and,
Whereas, on January 8, 2008 the RTD Board of Directors adopted Resolution No. 1 Series of
2008 providing that a screening committee composed of the Board Chair, the Chair of the Salaried
Employee Pension Trust Fund and the Finance Chair (i.e., Chair of the Finance Administration and Audit
Committee) will screen applications from the middle management salaried employee class and the
senior management salaried employee class and will bring recommendations back to the Board; and,
Whereas, in 2010, Resolution No. 27 made modification to state that, for reappointment of
Trustees who have served satisfactorily and in whose education the Trusts have made substantial
investments, it is not necessary to seek applications for renewal, and instead the application process
established by the RTD Board of Directors in 2008 will be used on those occasions when the Board
finds it necessary or appropriate to appoint new salaried trustees to the Trusts; and,
Whereas, on May 31, 2016, in Resolution No. 008 Series of 2016, the RTD Board of Directors
amended the Pension Trust and the Defined Contribution Trust, to end the “senior” and “middle”
management distinction, and instead authorized the Board of Directors to appoint two employee
Trustees who participate in the Pension Plan and two who participate in the Defined Contribution Plan,
in addition to the two Board members who are appointed to the Trusts and the Chief Financial Officer
who is a permanent member of the Trusts, to serve as the same set of trustees on both of the Trusts;
and
Whereas, the Chair of the RTD Board of Directors has appointed Director Ken Mihalik to
replace Director Judy Lubow as one of the Board of Director Trustees positions; and
Whereas, in accordance with the above Resolutions, the RTD Board of Directors now wishes to
appoint Director Ken Mihalik to serve as one of the Director appointees, with a term expiring
12/31/2020.
