## II. January Board Meeting Agenda Review

Committee Chair Tobiassen provided the initial review of the agenda. Interim General Manager Genova indicated that we have a number of retirees and are awaiting to see if any of them plan to be present.

Motion:              Director Solano made the motion to approve moving the January 19 Board agenda to the full Board.

Director Deadwyler seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Director Bagley indicated he will not have an update from the GM Oversight and Performance Management committee but would remind the Board of the upcoming joint Board-staff advance for March 5, 2016.  Paula Perdue shared that we have issued a RFP for a facilitator.  When the facilitator is selected, the Chair of the Board and General Manager would sit with the facilitator to set expectations for the Advance.  Most likely, the facilitator will contact the full Board members for their input.

Chair Tobiassen reminded the Committee that if they have a question on a unanimous consent item, it is best to remove that item so it can be discussed.  Paula Perdue elaborated to say that if an item is not removed from the unanimous consent agenda and someone votes no, it is the same as having voted no on every item on that unanimous consent agenda.

Chair Tobiassen noted that we had some confusion on the recommended action item for the April 2016 service changes.

IGM Genova indicated that staff had outreached to the City of Denver around the Board’s concern on the potential loss of revenue due to the federal government requirements.  The City is taking this under consideration but has not provided a response.  We hope to hear from them by next Tuesday’s meeting.  Director Deadwyler inquired about what would be the correct process if they wanted to change the 16 street mall change but not vote down the overall action.  IGM Genova explained that the Board’s option would be to do an amendment on the 16 st mall item and follow the Robert’s Rules for voting on an amendment.  Director Menten inquired what would it take to make the loss of revenue issue cost neutral. Director Menten also inquired if a dollar amount had been discussed with Denver.   IGM Genova stated that he was not sure but staff is looking at the costs and possible impacts.

Director Folska expressed that cost is one of her concerns and she would recommend postponement if costs are not known.  Paula Perdue asked for clarification that she meant postponement as an amendment to the action item and not postponement of the action item itself on the April 2016 Service Changes.

Director Bagley stated we need to find out their timeline from the City of Denver on when they need an approval.  We need to understand the impact of a delay on them as well.

Director Walker shared that the data appears empirical and it may be beneficial to partner with the City to understand the impact of the planned Meet in the Street series.  Director Deadwyler agreed with this issue but pointed out that if these days can affect our ridership to the point that we can lose some federal funding, she does not believe that RTD should have to eat this loss.  Denver should pay for it.

IGM Genova noted this could be a valuable experience for all of us as Denver envision how to make the 16 st mall better.  This is a great opportunity to partner.  We are concerned about the potential reduction in ridership as well as remaining cost neutral.  The type of funding we are discussing is formula funding and part of the study that RTD is participating in is there an opportunity to beef up ridership in downtown in general during the Meet in the Street events.  He noted that 3 of these weekends will be Coors Rockies games and perhaps this could end up increasing overall downtown ridership.  He shared that the detour off the 16 st mall would bypass the Market Street to Union Station leg.

Director Deadwyler inquired about the Investment Advisor Services and asked if we had paid the $300K to the service provider last year.  IGM Genova indicated this is true but noted that what we pay to the service provider is a factor of the size of the investment portfolio and not how much money we made or lost.  We are under guidelines around that.  Chair Tobiassen also noted that it would be quite risky to pay our advisor services based on our profit.  This would encourage risky type investments and would defeat the policy for RTD.

Director Deadwyler asked about the action item on the purchase of the 46-45” heavy-duty intercity buses.  Her concern was when will we start to have discussions around other types of buses that will accommodate things like carts, baby strollers and other items that people use to haul groceries and such.  IGM Genova explained this particular action was more for the Over-the-Road buses similar to Flatiron Flyer.  The type of buses that Director Deadwyler was addressing are more of the inner-city buses.

Director Solano inquired how was the selection made on who would service or provide the associated components.  He has heard from local suppliers who question why we hire foreign companies to provide these parts.  IGM Genova explained that sometimes it is more cost effective and efficient to have the parts provided from the manufacturer; moreover, we issue requests for competitive bids for this type service.  Normally it is based on the cost.

## III. Other Matters

- Director Bagley commented that he was present to support the new Executive Committee. He noted the responsibility of the committee is to provide high level governance and not staff-related items.  They need to understand the Bylaws and adhere to Robert’s Rules. They need to encourage other Board members and to be respectful of each other, the staff and the constituents.  The Committee needs to help us instill a culture of mutual respect and we should not have or exhibit an adversary relationship with staff in a public setting.

Director Deadwyler thanked Director Bagley for his comments.  She stated that she had a conversation with Chair Tobiassen on his philosophy as well.  She is committed to doing her part to be more neutral and respectful.  She also thinks that sometimes as part of the attempt to understand information that staff has provided to them, it may appear they are being adversarial when they are seeking understanding.

- Director Bagley shared that he had a discussion with a constituent around the dropped service issue.  He tried to explain what is happening with our hiring efforts, the effect of a more positive economy on our ability to hire drivers and also some of the impacts of Colorado approval of marijuana on passing drug tests, etc.  There was a lot of discussion on this issue especially since RTD follows the federal law on drug testing (CDL licenses, etc) while we are a state that has approved marijuana usage on a local basis.  Director Solano and others made the point that this is a growing issue that RTD needs to get its arm around as to how we can handle this when it may affect our ability to hire.  IGM Genova noted that currently all the data we have around this is anecdotal and cautioned the Committee on using this information.  Director Bagley spoke of the law of unintended consequences.

- Director Menten added that our shortage of workers affect not only drivers but mechanics. We are short about 38 mechanics and could that be affecting the number of buses we need to order as well?
