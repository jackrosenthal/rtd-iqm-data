BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
2025-26 Strategic Initiatives

October 6, 2025

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Debra A. Johnson, General Manager/CEO
John McKay, Chief of Staff
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD’s 2021-2026 Strategic Plan (Strategic Plan) was approved by the Board during a Special Board
Meeting held on Tuesday, August 10, 2021.
The Strategic Plan establishes the agency’s four Strategic Priorities, which serve as the functional
pillars used to plan, develop, evaluate, and measure the agency’s overall performance:
•

Community Value: RTD strives to be a strong community partner, providing value to customers

•
•
•

as well as to the broader Denver metro region while sustaining planet Earth
Customer Excellence: RTD strives to consistently deliver high-quality customer service
Employee Ownership: RTD seeks to attract and retain a highly skilled and engaged workforce
Financial Success: RTD takes very seriously the management of all financial resources

Each Strategic Priority is associated with a measurable Success Outcome.
Leveraging data garnered through operational performance and Community Value, Customer
Excellence, and Employee Ownership surveys, each year agency leaders convene strategy sessions to
develop tactics that seek to improve overall agency performance in specific areas.
For the 2024-25 annual performance cycle, non-represented employees with managerial responsibilities
were required to develop and strive to achieve “stretch” goals developed using the SMART framework
and based on the Strategic Initiatives. These goals were intentionally designed to drive and incentivize
individual performance, which in turn improves the performance of the agency overall. Moreover, the
initiatives reflect a renewed collective focus to deliver meaningful progress toward achieving the
Success Outcomes.
Staff anticipates leveraging a similar process for the 2025-26 performance cycle.
DISCUSSION

Packet Pg. 3

1.C.1

Continuing to refine Strategic Initiatives and focusing staff efforts to drive agency progress directly
aligns with the tenets of the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan.
In addition to the Strategic Initiative of Customer and Community Connections, which returns for the
2025-26 performance cycle, staff has developed three new initiatives as:
•
•
•
•

Enhancing Public Trust: RTD seeks to bolster trust among the communities served by
demonstrating good stewardship of taxpayer dollars and transit assets.
Building a Better RTD: RTD is future-focused on the advancement of its people power and the
enhancement of its infrastructure.
Service Excellence: RTD recognizes the importance of reliably delivering high-quality transit
service to support the mobility needs of transit customers.
Customer and Community Connections: RTD is committed to fostering community building and
enriching the customer experience.

Staff has developed an Annual Scorecard related to agency performance driven by an operational
vantage point. The attached scorecard captures the 2025-26 Strategic Initiatives and tactics, along with
leading indicators designed to focus efforts to improve outcomes related to the Strategic Plan.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no direct financial impact associated with the 2025-26 Strategic Initiatives or the associated
Annual Scorecard.

PRESENTATION LENGTH
30 minutes
BACKGROUND
Strategic Plan
RTD’s 2021-2026 Strategic Plan (Strategic Plan) was approved by the Board during a Special Board
Meeting held on Tuesday, August 10, 2021.
The Strategic Plan establishes the agency’s four Strategic Priorities, which serve as the functional
pillars used to plan, develop, evaluate, and measure the agency’s overall performance:

Community Value: RTD strives to be a strong community partner, providing value to customers
as well as to the broader Denver metro region while sustaining planet Earth
Customer Excellence: RTD strives to consistently deliver high-quality customer service
Employee Ownership: RTD seeks to attract and retain a highly skilled and engaged workforce
Financial Success: RTD takes very seriously the management of all financial resources
Each Strategic Priority is associated with a measurable Success Outcome. The revised Agency
Performance Scorecard, which captures metrics used to gauge progress toward these outcomes and
serves as a tool to frame the conversation regarding the agency’s operational and financial well-being,
was approved during the monthly Board meeting on Tuesday, October 22, 2024.
Strategic Initiatives
Progress toward the Strategic Priorities is measured by way of key operational performance data and
responses to annual employee, customer, and community surveys. This information is then used to
identify areas of opportunity for improvement. Strategic Initiatives and associated tactics are developed
each year to improve agency performance in those specific areas.
Performance Dashboard
The Performance Dashboard, which launched on RTD’s website in May 2024, serves as an easily
accessible repository for performance data related to the Strategic Plan. The Performance Dashboard
contains data, graphics, and linked information related to the agency budget and financial reports,

people power statistics, and other key measurements. The Performance Dashboard enhances agency
transparency and assists the Performance Committee’s efforts to assess the agency’s progress toward
Strategic Plan Success Outcomes.
DISCUSSION
During the Performance Committee meeting scheduled for Monday, October 6, 2025, committee
members and staff review data and trends related to financial performance metrics, and staff will
present information specifically pertaining to the Strategic Priority of Customer Excellence.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
