Others Present:              Paula Perdue, Marla Lien – General Counsel, Monte Whaley – Reporter

## II. Appointment of Transition Team

Chair Sisk began the meeting by acknowledging all the Board members in attendance and thanked them for their interest in the future of RTD.  He then announced his GM Executive Search Committee:  Chair Sisk as Chair of this committee, Director Bagley, Director Deadwyler, Director Francone and Director Tobiassen.

Director Menten inquired as to how he chose these members.  Chair Sisk stated he had done quite a bit of soul searching as to who would be the best members to represent the interest of the Board and agency. He was looking for diversity in terms of senior members who were part of the 2010 transition committee and could provide a historical perspective, new Board members who could provide an infusion of fresh ideas, and diversity of thoughts and ideas.

Director Tobiassen thanked the Chair for the opportunity to serve on this committee.  He expressed his commitment of time and sacrifice to be available and actively participate on this committee.  He plans to use his vacation and other time to be present.  He is committed to open communications with the full Board.

Director Solano expressed that the former General Manager before GM Washington was overpaid.  He stated it is time for a change.  We need new standards for pay. He stated no good leader would lead the troops on a hill and desert them.  This is a slippery slope.

Director Lubow inquired about who would be the Chair.  Chair Sisk indicated he will act as Chair. Director Lubow expressed some concerns as to how the full Board can have input.

Director Lasater inquired as to the interim General Manager and permanent General Manager role.  Is this clearly defined and who will define this.  Chair Sisk indicated that once the GM Executive Search team is identified, they will work the process for this; however, it is clearly expected that the full Board will have input.  We will utilize a buddy system and ultimately any decision will come before the full Board for approval.

Director Bagley shared that there were three Board members who are still on the Board when the transition occurred in 2009.  He noted this is a very intensive, laborious process of love.  He recalls easily working 50 hours per week on this Committee.

Director Solano stated his credentials and previous experience in working with an attorney on employment issues; he just wants to do a good job.  He raised the issue of why no Latino was on this committee.  He stated the Latino population represents about 57% of the population and should have a strong voice in this selection process.

Chair Sisk noted that RTD is a very successful agency and we cannot lose sight of our fiduciary responsibilities.  He believes this is an opportunity for the Board to come together in unison and cooperation.

## III. Review of Transition Process Policy

Paula Perdue provided a high-level view of the most important key decision points of the Board/GM Executive Search Committee over the coming months as documented in the BOD process for hiring/transitioning to a new General Manager.  She noted that in 2010, no such document exists so this document followed the process that had been created and successfully executed.  Some of these key decision points included:

- Appointment of Transition Committee

- Selection of Interim GM

- Signature replacement/authorization on agency checks

- Review of GM Payout (salary, vacation time, sick time, pension) and a review performed by independent audit Rubin Brown.  This requires approval from the Chair

- Determine communication strategy for employees/stakeholders/elected officials

- Review Board approved compensation philosophy

- Hire strategic advisory service

- Build project workplan and schedules/timelines

- Hire outside legal service/employment law

- Hire benchmarking firm for full benchmarking (if needed)

- Review of Job Description/establish of candidate profile

- Selection of Civic leader panel

- Interview process

- Public/stakeholder forum or reception

- Selection of GM

Paula emphasized the importance of transparency and open communications throughout this process.  She especially emphasized the importance of confidentiality for candidates or potential applicants.  The Colorado Statute defines when a candidate becomes a finalist and when names can be released.  The Board will need to strike a balance on the need to know and the protection of the candidate confidentiality.

General Counsel Marla Lien referenced some of the legal concerns related to Open meetings/open records and the procurement process.  She indicated that we will work through Brian Iacono organization, procurement, to make sure we follow the proper procurement process. The RFPs for national search firm, outside legal services or other management services will be handled by procurement.

Board members need to also understand what constitutes a meeting.  Electronic chatter could be classified as a meeting if more than two people are involved.  Also, Board members should use their RTD accounts for any electronic communications.

Relative to the code of ethics, we will follow a fair and open process.  Board members and staff can be expected to be solicited and lobbied on all levels.  Board members will need to refer these types of inquiries to our procurement department to avoid any perception of code violation.

Director Lasater inquired if we have any estimates of cost for this based on the 2009 transition process.  Paula Perdue indicated she will try to research and compile.

Director Folska asked for a clarification between what constitutes lobbying and just being fair.  Marla Lien used the example of lobbying as it relates to job related issues; Board members negotiating with firms or vendors or individuals rather than having all interested party in the same room receiving the same and consistent information.  The use of names or references sometimes can create a problem.

Director Bagley re-emphasized the importance of confidentiality.  When in doubt, just don’t do it.

Director Menten referenced different sections in the document and asked for more explanation.  She also inquired about the ability to do her own personal investigation of candidates.  Marla Lien stated that within the process, we will have various ways to get information; however, we cautioned that there has to be a balance between the request for confidentiality and Board members going off on their own.  Chair Sisk shared the example in Washington where because of a confidentiality leak, all of the candidates withdrew from the job and they had to start over.  This adds tremendous delay, costs and affects the ability/credibility of the agency.

Director Lubow expressed concern that the document is just a guideline and not written in stone. She does not feel this process absolves her from her responsibility to the transition process. She thinks the benchmarking will be important and she would like this team to come back to the full Board for guidance.  Director Menten dittoed similar sentiments.

Director Anderson expressed that all of the Board members are concerned but not all can be on the transition team. She believes this is a great effort and the Buddy system should work.  What is also important is confidentiality.  Board members will have a chance to participate throughout the process and can make a list of what is important to them for a GM.  Chair Sisk elaborated that the ultimate selection will be by a vote of the full Board.

Director James indicated he was pleased with the process. He sees this almost as a matchmaking process.  If we follow the rules, the process will work better.  It is also important to remember that relevant to the interviewing process, we are interviewing candidates but they are also interviewing us.  We need to be on our best behavior.

Director Lasater shared he has participated on three hiring processes in the city of Parker.  The process we are following is very similar to the process used by Parker and he is comfortable with it.  It is important that our process is inclusive of staff, citizens, stakeholders, communities and others.  The Buddy system is a good channel to make sure the full Board is informed. At the end of the day, the full Board selects the interim General Manager and permanent General Manager.

## IV. Advice from Legal Counsel and Executive Session and Procurement

Marla Lien provided legal counsel relative to going into Executive Session.  She stated that executive session has to be only for the purpose as stated on the C.R.S.; that no voting is allowed in Executive Session and that the reason why the Board can go into Executive Session for interim GM is because names will be discussed.  She stated that the discussion could be about the options for interim General Manager.  If the Board chooses to select a name, they must come out of Executive Session, the Executive Committee can make a motion and the full Board would approve in the upcoming Board meeting.  If they decide on a process, the Executive decision can determine that and no action would be required.

## V. Motion to Move to Executive Session

- C.R.S. 24-6-402(4)(f) Personnel Matters, Interim General Manager

Motion:              Director Hoy made the motion to move into Executive Session to discuss C.R.S. 24-6-402(4)(f) Personnel Matters, Interim General Manager.

Director Walker seconded the motion.

The meeting adjourned into Executive session at 4:10 p.m.

## VI. Adjourn from Executive Session

The meeting adjourned from Executive Session at 4:43 p.m.

## VII. Recommended Action from Executive Session (if needed)

There were no recommendations from Executive Session.

## VIII. Next Steps

Chair Sisk informed the Committee that they will follow a process of inviting members of the Senior Leadership Team to submit for the position of Interim General Manager.  Invitations will go out on March 19 and responses are due by April 1.  We are targeting April 10 for a decision by the full Board.

## IX. Adjourn from Meeting

The meeting adjourned at 4:55 p.m.
