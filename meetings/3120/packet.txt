DESCRIPTION OF WORK:
The Denver Regional Transportation District (“RTD”) is seeking a dynamic,
collaborative and progressive executive to lead the organization as its next
General Manager/Chief Executive Officer (“GM/CEO”).
Reporting to a 15-member directly elected Board of Directors, the GM/CEO will
provide strategic and visionary leadership to over 2,600 employees and will be
responsible for the overall performance and organizational effectiveness of the
RTD in carrying out its mission and objectives of being one of the nation’s premier
public transit agencies in providing safe, reliable, affordable and timely service to
the greater Denver region. The GM/CEO will work closely with the RTD Board to
provide accurate transparent advice, counsel and recommendations as the Board
works to set short and long term policy for the RTD in order to carry out its
business objectives. The GM/CEO will also take policy set by the Board and
implement that policy into actionable business items that will deliver a high level
of service to RTD’s customers.
As the RTD continues to complete one of the nation’s largest capital expansion
programs, the GM/CEO will work closely with the Board, staff, community, elected
and appointed officials and all other stakeholders to ensure that the day-to-day
administration of that program is completed on-time and on-budget. The GM/CEO
will also lead a highly talented and committed workforce that oversees day-to-day
operations and maintenance thereby ensuring that RTD continues to deliver a
high level of rail, bus and paratransit services to its customers on a daily basis. In
doing so, the GM/CEO will create a positive work environment by leading his/her
executive leadership team and engaging with employees on a daily basis, both in
the offices and out in the field, to foster a collaborative, innovative, progressive
work culture and positive work environment.
The ideal GM/CEO candidate will be a passionate, dynamic and forward thinking
leader with strong interpersonal and communication skills and exceptional
negotiating skills. The GM/CEO will be a balanced leader who has the ability to
manage and lead an organization in a highly political, complex and transparent
environment. The GM/CEO must be someone who is capable of working
collaboratively with represented employees and building bridges internally and
externally to create opportunities for the advancement of the RTD’s strategic
objectives. In order to ensure the RTD’s success, the GM/CEO must be
progressive in identifying technological initiatives and other forward thinking
business practices that maximize efficiencies and offer service options to its
customers. These best practices will in turn allow the RTD to be a strong partner
Packet Pg. 7
to the local business community and the greater Denver region thereby advancing

workplace culture.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
The General Manager Executive Search/Oversight & Performance Management Committee (Committee)
presents to the Board a motion to approve the attached Resolution No. ______, to identify one of three
finalist candidates as RTD’s General Manager, subject to negotiation and execution of an employment
contract.
BACKGROUND
Following the departure of David Genova from his position as General Manager in January 2020, the
Board engaged in a robust search process and selected Paul J. Ballard to serve as the interim General
Manager until such time the Board could select a person to perform the role on an ongoing basis.
Following a nationwide search, the Committee, in consultation with the executive search firm
Krauthamer & Associates, reviewed application materials from individuals representing a wide degree of
backgrounds and experiences. In the meeting held on Wednesday, July 22, 2020, the Committee
selected seven individuals to move forward as preliminary candidates for the position, one of whom
would later withdraw from consideration.
The Committee, while convened in executive session during Committee meetings held on August 5 and
6, 2020, interviewed the six preliminary candidates in order to identify the individuals who should move
forward in the process as “finalists”, as that term is defined in CRS §24-6-402 (3.5).
On August 7, 2020, the Board announced that it had selected Debra Johnson, Adelee Le Grand, and
Tina Quigley as finalists for the General Manager position.
Following initial outreach efforts aimed at gathering feedback from RTD’s employees, constituents, and
key stakeholders regarding the candidates, the Committee held a second round of interviews for the
finalist candidates on August 19, 2020.
In order to inform the Board’s decision, additional input was received from employees, stakeholders, and
the public through an online survey that was open from the time of the second round of interviews
through August 23, 2020.
DISCUSSION
In adopting this Recommended Action and its associated resolution, the Board identifies one of the three
finalists to be named in the resolution as the agency’s General Manager. As soon as practicable
following the adoption of this action and the resolution, the Board of Directors will promptly negotiate an
employment agreement with the individual identified as the General Manager.
As soon as practicable following the appointment of the General Manager, the Board will promptly
negotiate an employment agreement with the General Manager appointee; provided, however, that such

Packet Pg. 12

1.E.1

employment agreement shall be finalized and fully executed on or before October 28, 2020, or at such
other time as the Board may determine in its sole discretion.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The financial impact related to the appointment of the General Manager is contemplated in the
employment agreement.
