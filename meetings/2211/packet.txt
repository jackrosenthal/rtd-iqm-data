BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: June 26, 2014

From:

William C. Van Meter,Assistant General
Manager, Planning

GM

Date:

June 20, 2014

Board Meeting Date: July 15, 2014

Subject:

RTP/Senate Bill 208 State Highway 119

Resolution
RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
approve the attached Resolution, which will permit staff to submit to DRCOG an SB 208 Report in
early 2015 which specifies the technology and the method of financing for the SH 119 Bus Rapid
Transit (BRT) project.
BACKGROUND
This action fits within the General Manager’s 2014 Goals of Innovative and fiscally sustainable
service delivery and Grow ridership and engage customers across the region as implementation of
the SH 119 BRT project will increase the service reliability, ridership and cost effectiveness of the
service.
RTD initiated the Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS), in April 2013. The purpose of the st udy
was to develop consensus among RTD, the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) and the
Northwest-area stakeholders, including local jurisdictions and businesses, on cost effective and
efficient mobility improvements to serve the Northwest area. On June 24, 2014, the Board approved
a resolution which accepted the Final Consensus Statement as developed by the NAMS stakeholders
for priorities within the Northwest Study Area. The highest consensus priority for arterial BRT, as
described in the NAMS Final Consensus Statement, was to proceed into advanced planning,
environmental clearance and preliminary engineering to establish BRT in the SH 119 Corridor from
Longmont to Boulder. Staff submitted a Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery
(TIGER) Planning Grant on April 28, 2014, to pursue these advanced planning activities. As part of
the 2040 Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) process, Boulder County, using the results of RTD’s
NAMS analyses, has submitted the SH 119 Corridor for consideration by DRCOG for inclusion in the
2040 Regional Transportation Plan (RTP). DRCOG’s RTP scoring criteria indicate that the project is
eligible for inclusion in the fiscally-constrained RTP and would be eligible for future federal funding
participation through the DRCOG Transportation Improvement Program. Inclusion of the corridor in
the RTP is required before National Environmental Planning Act (NEPA) clearance can be completed.
The cost to establish BRT in the corridor is estimated to be approximately $57 million in 2013 dollars
and $75 million in Year of Expenditure dollars (2021-2024).
DISCUSSION
SB 208 grants DRCOG the statutory authority to review and approve the technology and method of
financing for RTD fixed-guideway projects. Should RTD pursue BRT in this corridor, as prioritized by
the NAMS Final Consensus Statement, the SH 119 BRT project would be subject to SB 208
approval. Discussions with DRCOG staff have indicated that RTD should submit the SB 208 report in

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

early 2015. The expectation is that the funding breakdown for BRT in the corridor would be as
follows:



50 percent from RTD Base System Funds; and
50 percent from DRCOG Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) funds through the
Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement (CMAQ) funds and/or Surface
Transportation Program (STP)-Metro funds.

Based on current financial projections, project construction is expected to occur within the 2021 to
2024 timeframe. However, recognizing the effectiveness of this project and local stakeholder
support, RTD intends to pursue opportunities to accelerate project planning, environmental and
design work and to explore financing options to accelerate the project completion date. Future Board
action would be required to approve advancing BRT in this corridor.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact directly related to this action; however, should the Board at a later date, and
after further study, opt to move forward with implementation of this project, there will be a financial
impact to the District. Current DRCOG projections for the fiscally-constrained 2040 RTP indicate the
project will be eligible for federal funding support through the TIP in the 2015 -2024 timeframe as
described above. The cost of the corridor is projected to be $57 million in 2013 dollars and $75 million
in Year of Expenditure dollars (2021-2024), with the expectation that 50 percent of the project’s
funding would come from DRCOG TIP sources and 50 percent from RTD Base System Funds; and future
Board action would be required to advance implementation of this BRT corridor.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning and Development
Committee that the RTD Board of Directors approve the attached Resolution, which will
permit staff to submit to DRCOG an SB 208 Report in early 2015 which specifies the
technology and the method of financing for the SH 119 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) project.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not approve the attached resolution, which
would permit staff to submit to DRCOG, when appropriate, an SB 208 Report which specifies
the technology and the method of financing for the SH 119 BRT project.

RESOLUTION No. ____
SERIES OF 2014
APPROVAL OF SH 119 BUS RAPID TRANSIT PLANS PURSUANT TO SB
208 (C.R.S. 32-9-107.7) AND DIRECTING STAFF TO SUBMIT PROJECT FOR
CONSIDERATION TO THE DENVER REGIONAL COUNCIL OF
GOVERNMENTS
Whereas, RTD initiated the Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS), in April 2013. The
purpose of the study was to develop consensus among RTD, the Colorado Department of
Transportation (CDOT) and the Northwest-area stakeholders, including local jurisdictions and
businesses, on cost effective and efficient mobility improvements to serve the Northwest area;
Whereas, on June 24, 2014, the RTD Board approved a resolution which accepted the
Final Consensus Statement as developed by the NAMS stakeholders for priorities within the
Northwest Study Area;
Whereas, one of the highest priorities, as described in the Final Consensus Statement,
was to proceed into advanced planning, environmental clearance and preliminary engineering to
establish Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) in the SH 119 Corridor from Longmont to Boulder;
Whereas, RTD has submitted a Transportation Investment Generating Economic
Recovery (TIGER) grant to pursue advanced planning for BRT in the SH 119 Corridor;
Whereas, Boulder County, using the results of RTD’s NAMS analysis, has submitted the
SH 119 BRT corridor for consideration and inclusion in the 2040 Regional Transportation Plan
(RTP) process;
Whereas, inclusion of the corridor in the RTP is required before National Environmental
Planning Act (NEPA) clearance can be completed;
Whereas, the cost to establish BRT is estimated to be approximately $57 million in 2013
dollars and $75 million in Year of Expenditure dollars and the expectation is that,
implementation of the SH 119 BRT Corridor would occur in the 2021 to 2024 timeframe, if not
sooner;
Whereas, future Board action will be required prior to the implementation of BRT in this
corridor.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that:
The RTD Board of Directors hereby approves the plans for SH 119 Bus Rapid Transit
pursuant to SB 208 (C.R.S. 32-9-107.7) and;
