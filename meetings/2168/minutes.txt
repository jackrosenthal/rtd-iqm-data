Call to Order:

Chair Pro Tem Martinez called the meeting to order at
12:08 p.m.

Recommended Action: RESOLUTION NO.____ SERIES OF 2010 Resolution
Pertaining to Amendments 60& 61 and Proposition 101
Director Daly introduced this item. The resolution before the committee
combined the thoughts and edits from Directors Daly, Christopher and Tayer.
The committee also received a separate edited version from Marla Lien and
Sherri Ellebracht for consideration. Some of the differences noted from these
two versions were in the sequencing from the amendments having most impact
to the one having the least and a breaking apart of some of the thoughts in the
“whereas” statements for clarity purposes. After some discussion about the
desire to make this a reader friendly document, the committee decided to
accept the revised version from Marla Lien.
Motion:

Director Bagley made the motion to approve the
Marla Lien revised resolution and to move it
forward for full Board review and approval at the
Board meeting.
Director Busck seconded the motion.

August Board Meeting Agenda Review
General Manager Phil Washington was on vacation. Dave Genova, Assistant
General Manager, Safety, Security and Facilities presented the August Board
meeting agenda.
Motion:

Chair Kemp made the motion to move the
August Board meeting agenda as amended to
the full Board for vote on August 17, 2010.
Director Bagley seconded the motion.

Discussion:

The Committee wants staff to give a brief
presentation on the differences in the 2010
amended budget before the Chair reads the
public hearing announcement so that the
constituents will have a better understanding of
the change.
The Committee wants the 2011 Fare Policy
Public Input Process moved to recommended
action for further discussion. One of the
requests from the Committee is for staff to
incorporate a general question into the hearing
process to get the constituent’s view of “would
they be in favor of a higher rate increase to
minimize the chances of service reduction (or
similar question)? Staff will need to be nimble
enough to incorporate the feedback from these
hearings into their recommended options. (i.e.
need a mechanism to implement a change if the
voters express a different desire than the staff
recommended one).
Item G, Approval of 2011-2016 Strategic
Budget Plan, requires further discussion on the
options and the impact of delaying a decision on
this until later.
Director Busck expressed the overriding message
from the Board to staff is they have put us in a
bad position because of how the timelines for
the fare public input process collides with when
they expect the Board to make a decision on the
Strategic Budget Plan. It does not provide a
chance to receive option scenarios or

Summary of the Executive Committee Meeting held on August 12, 2010, at 12:00
p.m.
Page 3 of 7
information from the fare hearing in a timely
manner to determine what is the proper option
to move forward in the SBP. Staff needs to
present options that are equitable across the
Board when cuts are made. We are sending staff
a message about future service cuts—needs
more input from the Board and need to change
process that will allow for expanding the
options. Director Brohl added we need to
legitimize service cuts so everyone feels the pain
and we need to avoid “foreclosing transit” in
those areas that have no options. Director
Bagley stated we are spending so much time on
FasTracks and not giving the proper time to the
base business-need to refocus.
The Committee requested that the Strategic
Budget Plan becomes a standing item for
discussion on the next three agendas.

the Motion:

The Motion PASSED.

Other Matters
Director Brohl brought up the issue of elections for the Executive Committee.
She revisited the discussion from the Executive Committee last year where she
had expressed similar concerns at that time. She referred to an e-mail sent by
Director Martinez on his recollection of the process that was discussed and
asked if the full Board ever received that process. Director Busck responded it
had been discussed but did not go out to the full Board. Director Brohl then
stated her concern about process—as a Board what do we want that process
to look like? If we are doing slates, everyone should know that and have the
option of creating a slate or do the Board members campaign for executive
positions individually? Should we have a Nominating Committee? Maybe the
Board should have a meeting where every Board member who is interested in a
position on the Executive committee announces their interest and qualifications
for the position. In the interest of transparency, everyone needs an equal
chance if they are interested in a position.
Director Busck expressed his perspective that this is politics and this is how it
works. He feels the real issue is with the Chairmanship and the other positions
are irrelevant. Once a person decides to run for Chair, they generally try to put
a ticket together (find other Board members) who they think will work well
with them on the Executive Committee and who share similar views/visions.
Director Cohen stated that we should have an inclusive Board based on the
premise that all of the Board members are elected by their constituents, each
bringing different strengths and talents. The presumption would be that any
one of them is “qualified” to be a member of the Executive committee. We
need to have an open process.
After more discussion, Director Busck suggested the Chair should send out an
e-mail along with the job descriptions for each position asking anyone who may
be interested in running for a position on the Executive Board to indicate their
interest. Sometime after the new Board members are elected, the Board
should have a meeting where they openly discuss and develop a policy for
what they want to do in the future. Director Brohl asked if this will be a slate
or individual approach. This question was not clearly answered but left the
impression that people who are interested in a position for 2011 may need to
“campaign”.

Director Cohen stated he think it will be valuable input to get the perspectives
from the retiring Board members. Chair Kemp stated that he and Paula are
already having discussions about an exit strategy with the retiring Board
members. Chair Pro Tem Martinez indicated that this was a broader view of
what Director Cohen was focusing on relative to the election of officers.
Chair Kemp indicated he will get with Paula on the drafting of the e-mail. The
Committee thought it appropriate that if anyone is interested in running for a
position, they can do a “reply” all.
