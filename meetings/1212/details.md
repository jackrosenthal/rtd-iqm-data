#### 1. Park Creek Metro District & Forest City Stapleton, Inc. Inter-governmental Agreement Amendment

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or designee, to execute a third amendment of an existing Inter-Governmental Agreement (IGA) with Park Creek Metro District & Forest City Stapleton, Inc. for participating in the funding for the design, construction, and management of the infrastructure that will support the Central Park PnR along the East Rail Line.  It is also recommended that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or designee, to execute the necessary documents to convey a certain amount of RTD property for dedication as City and County of Denver ROW. The cost maximum for RTD’s share of the infrastructure improvements has been determined to be $5,564,325. Funding for this IGA is included in the 2013 Amended Capital Programs and the FasTracks Eagle project budgets.

#### 2. Approval of Final Scope Elements for US 36 Bus Rapid Transit

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors approve the final scope elements (as illustrated in the table below) to establish BRT in the US 36 Corridor, as it is RTD Staff’s desire and intent to implement a “World Class” Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) in the US 36 Corridor.  RTD Staff believe that the implementation of these final scope elements will effectively complete a model BRT in the US 36 Corridor.  Approval of this action will allow RTD to commit to the completion of the US 36 BRT project through implementation of defined scope items, as RTD does on every other project in the FasTracks program.
