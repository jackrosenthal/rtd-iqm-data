Date:

Board Meeting Date: September 3, 2013

Subject:

Park Creek Metro District & Forest City
Stapleton, Inc. Inter-governmental Agreement
Amendment

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the
General Manager, or designee, to execute a third amendment of an existing Inter-Governmental
Agreement (IGA) with Park Creek Metro District & Forest City Stapleton, Inc. for participating in the
funding for the design, construction, and management of the infrastructure that will support the Central
Park PnR along the East Rail Line. It is also recommended that the Board of Directors authorize the
General Manager, or designee, to execute the necessary documents to convey a certain amount of RTD
property for dedication as City and County of Denver ROW. The cost maximum for RTD’s share of the
infrastructure improvements has been determined to be $5,564,325. Funding for this IGA is included in
the 2013 Amended Capital Programs and the FasTracks Eagle project budgets.
BACKGROUND
In 1996, with the opening of DIA and the closure of the Stapleton Airport, RTD began operating a Bus
Transfer Facility and PnR at the previous parking site with surface and covered parking of over 1,000
spaces being provided through a license agreement between RTD and the City & County of Denver. In
August of 2010, RTD relocated its commuter parking to an interim gravel PnR at the northwest corner of
36th Avenue & Central Park Boulevard with approximately 1,500 surface parking spaces and an on-street
bus transfer operation on 36th Ave between Ulster and Central Park Boulevard.
During 2001, RTD received a CMAQ grant for the proposed relocation of the Stapleton PnR/Bus Transfer
Facility. Environmental clearances were initiated for the new permanent site between Smith Road /37th
Place and west of Central Park Boulevard. Several concept designs were proposed and coordinated with
the City and the developer over the years.
In July 2010, RTD entered into an IGA with Park Creek Metro District & Forest City Stapleton, Inc. for
acquisition, design and construction of public infrastructure improvements. Approximately 50% of the
identified Park-n-Ride site was acquired in late 2011. In the spring of 2012, a finding of “no further
action” was received for the environmental cleanup. This allowed RTD to acquire the remaining property
in July 2012, which gave RTD a total property ownership of approximately 20 acres on three individual
parcels that are separated by public ROW.
RTD amended this IGA twice with Park Creek Metro District & Forest City Stapleton, Inc. The first was
for early traffic signal and intersection design of Smith Road & Ulster Street ($39,279.00) to initiate
PUC applications by RTD’s Eagle team for the East Rail Line. The second was for implementation of
final design of the public infrastructure improvements ($150,000.00). These two amendments were
within the signature authority of the General Manager.

Packet Pg. 76

2.B.1

DISCUSSION
This will serve as a park-n-Ride for the new Eagle project Central Park Station. RTD committed to
provide 1,500 spaces as part of the Environmental Impact Statement.
The design of the infrastructure improvements was closely coordinated by the Park Creek Metro District
(PCMD) and its design consultant (URS). RTD staff and the project design consultant (FHU) reviewed,
commented, and ultimately approved the infrastructure design, and agreed with the proposed funding
share as described in the initial IGA and finalized in this 3rd amendment.
The infrastructure
improvements project was publicly bid and a negotiated best value was initiated by PCMD, and was
found to be within the guidelines of the Federal Acquisition Regulations and RTD’s procurement policies.
The construction of the infrastructure improvements is scheduled, and stated within the IGA, to be
complete four months prior to the opening day of the East Rail Line. The infrastructure construction will
be managed by PCMD. RTD will fund, oversee and approve the infrastructure improvements that are
adjacent to the RTD development site, including approval of any change orders over $50,000. PCMD is
completing a best value process and a construction contract is anticipated during the 3rd Qtr. 2013,
which will include a cost maximum value for RTD’s portion of the work that is part of this third
amendment to the IGA $5,564,325. If the submitted proposals exceed RTD’s allowable funding
($5,564,325), RTD will have no further payment obligation, but PCMD may suspend work unless
resolution is reached.
The infrastructure improvements for which RTD is responsible include: all or split portions of Smith
Road (54%) from approximately Syracuse to Xanthia Street; Ulster Street from 37th Place to Smith Road
(100%); Uinta Street from 37th Place to Smith Road (100%); and 37th Place from Ulster to its’ easterly
limits (located just west of Central Park Boulevard) (50%).
The infrastructure improvements for which PCMD is responsible include: all or portions of Smith Road
(46%) from approximately Syracuse to Xanthia Street; Ulster Street from 36th Avenue to 37th Place
(100%); Uinta Street from 35th Avenue to 37th Place . (100%); and 37th Place from Ulster to its’ easterly
limits, located just west of Central Park Boulevard (50%). The layout and overall cost sharing
responsibility is shown on the attached exhibit.
This infrastructure project will provide the roadway network and utilities to support the proposed Central
Park PnR having 1,500 surface parking spaces with 12 bus bays, which will connect to the Central Park
Commuter Rail Station along the East Rail Line. The Central Park PnR is currently in final design and
scheduled to be under construction in the spring of 2014 with an anticipated 3rd Qtr opening. A
separate construction contract for the PnR will be recommended for Board approval during the spring of
2014
FINANCIAL IMPACT
This total work of $5,564,325 is budgeted by the Eagle Project ($5,058,477) and the strategic budget
plan ($505,848).
The project includes a DBE component of 20%, which is being directed by PCMD.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or designee, to execute a third amendment of
an existing Inter-Governmental Agreement (IGA) with Park Creek Metro District & Forest City

Packet Pg. 77

2.B.1

Stapleton, Inc. for participating in the funding for the design, construction, and management of the
infrastructure that will support the Central Park PnR along the East Rail Line. It is also recommended
that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or designee, to execute the necessary
documents to convey a certain amount of RTD property for dedication as City and County of Denver
ROW. The cost maximum for RTD’s share of the infrastructure improvements has been determined to
be $5,564,325. Funding for this IGA is included in the 2013 Amended Capital Programs and the
FasTracks Eagle project budgets.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. This is not recommended as RTD has agreed in the initial
IGA to participate and to provide funding, of which we have already expended $189,279 toward the
project design.
3. Delay implementing the Recommended Action. This is not recommended because both design and
construction costs are anticipated to increase as the overall economy improves. Also, delaying this
action will jeopardize the opening of the Central Park PnR with the opening of the East Rail Line.

Approval of Final Scope Elements for US 36
Bus Rapid Transit

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors approve the
final scope elements (as illustrated in the table below) to establish BRT in the US 36 Corridor, as it is
RTD Staff’s desire and intent to implement a “World Class” Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) in the US 36
Corridor. RTD Staff believe that the implementation of these final scope elements will effectively
complete a model BRT in the US 36 Corridor. Approval of this action will allow RTD to commit to the
completion of the US 36 BRT project through implementation of defined scope items, as RTD does on
every other project in the FasTracks program.

to the station for residents north and
east of US 36 in Broomfield.
*Note: RTD’s ability to provide the full fleet required for opening day service will be dependent
on the cost of the vehicle that can best satisfy the corridor’s service requirements.
BACKGROUND
The 2004 voter-approved FasTracks Plan provided $204.1 million for BRT in the US 36 Corridor. The
original budget assumed $66 million for the RTD contribution for the HOV/Bus lanes (this was prio r
to the decision to pursue Managed Lanes) along with various upgrades to the corridor’s stations. The
remainder of the scope was left undefined. This budget has been adjusted with each Annual
Program Evaluation (APE) to reflect rises in the composite construction labor and materials costs.
However, unlike all of the other FasTracks corridors, RTD did not define a specific scope for the
corridor for the following reasons:




The joint CDOT/RTD Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) was not completed when the
FasTracks plan was under development;
It was unknown at the time of the FasTracks plan development how BRT would integrate with
CDOT expansion of the highway; and
It was assumed that construction would likely be led by CDOT since many of the anticipated BRT
elements would share the CDOT facility.

For these reasons, the FasTracks plan opted to create a budget which was deemed reasonable for
completing BRT in the Corridor. To date, RTD has completed the following improvements in the
corridor:










Construction of the McCaslin station platforms;
Construction of the McCaslin pedestrian bridge over US 36;
Relocation of the Church Ranch park-n-Ride;
Construction of the Church Ranch station platforms and slip ramps;
Relocation of the Broomfield park-n-Ride;
Construction of the Broomfield station platforms and slip ramps;
Construction of the Broomfield pedestrian bridge;
Construction of the Table Mesa pedestrian bridge; and
Construction of the Table Mesa eastbound station platform and slip ramp.

Additionally, RTD has also committed funding to CDOT and the High Performance Transportation
Enterprise (HPTE) for ongoing US 36 Managed Lanes construction. The US 36 Managed Lanes
project will construct the shared guideway (managed lanes) for travel time savings and reli ability,
install new station canopies, a fiber-optic communications network, and programmable information
displays for customer information. The managed lanes project also includes construction of the US
36 bikeway from the US 36 EIS. With the completion of all these projects, approximately $75
million (2015 dollars) remains in the FasTracks US 36 BRT budget commitment.
DISCUSSION
Many of the corridor’s stakeholders have expressed concern that, unlike every other FasTracks
corridor, the US 36 Corridor has not included a defined scope and, they have advocated that RTD
instead work with the stakeholders to define a BRT scope for the corridor and establish the
corresponding cost for the necessary capital items required to complete that scope in future
budgeting efforts. Through the Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS) process, the study’s project

Packet Pg. 81

2.B.2

team has worked with the stakeholders to determine the remaining capital elements that should be
included in the scope. At the July 30, 2013 NAMS Joint Policy/Tech nical Advisory Committee
(PAC/TAC) meeting, the PAC/TAC members agreed that, with the completion of the Phase I BRT
improvements and the completion of the Managed Lanes project, the following remaining scope
items should be implemented as part of US 36 BRT:

Station Amenities

Staff has determined that the first five elements on the list – station amenities, security upgrades,
Transit Signal Priority, Passenger Communications improvements, and vehicles (depending on vehicle
cost) – can be funded and in place by opening day. As illustrated in the table below, the total cost
for the remaining BRT capital elements varies considerably depending on the cost of the BRT vehicle
chosen. As noted above, in a separate, but parallel effort to NAMS, staff is working with the
corridor stakeholders to determine the preferred BRT vehicle attributes for the corridor service needs.
A staff recommendation for Board action on the vehicle procurement is anticipated in late 2013.

Packet Pg. 82

2.B.2

As shown in the table below, depending on the final cost of the remaining capital items, and
depending on the chosen BRT vehicle, the remaining cost for establishing BRT could vary between
$58 million and $79 million. Funding for these items could potentially come from the FasTracks
Internal Savings Account (FISA) and potentially from outside grants. In any case, staff is in
agreement with the stakeholders that, in order to establish BRT in the corridor, RTD should focus on
completing the required scope listed above rather than defining the project through the FasTracks
remaining commitment.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Depending on the final cost of the remaining capital items and the chosen BRT vehicle, RTD could be
required to allocate up to $4 million more than originally anticipated for the corridor. As noted above,
potential funding sources for these items could come from the FISA or other potential outside grant
sources.
