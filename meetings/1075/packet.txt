BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: November 28, 2012

From:

Richard F. Clarke, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

November 28, 2012

Board Meeting Date: December 4, 2012

Subject:

Disposition Plan for Excess Land in Ft. Lupton,
Weld County

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors approve the
proposed Disposition Plan for excess land for the 80,173 square feet (1.84 acres) net of county road
right of way located at 13215 Weld County Road 8, Fort Lupton, Colorado and further authorize the
General Manager and/or his designee to negotiate and execute a contract for the sale of the property.
BACKGROUND
The Agreement Regarding Engineering Design and Railroad Property Acquisition by and between Union
Pacific Railroad Company and the Regional Transportation District dated January 25, 2007 contemplated
an acquisition of UPRR sites in Denver, Fort Lupton and Brighton and a relocation of UPRR to Weld
County. The Agreement provided that in order for the FasTracks Project to proceed on schedule and to
avoid delays, it would be necessary and desirable for the UPRR to purchase, or purchase options for,
certain Relocation Sites prior to the completion of negotiations on the Final Agreement between the
parties. Pursuant to the Agreement, RTD paid UPRR 100% of costs, fees and expenses incurred by
UPRR related to the identification of, due diligence on, and purchase and ownership of six properties in
Weld County and one property in Denver County. RTD determined that is was not feasible to proceed
with acquisition and relocation of UPRR facilities and therefore according to the terms of the Agreement,
UPRR assigned or transferred to RTD the properties at no additional cost to RTD.
Resolution No. 8, Series of 2008 Concerning the Sale of Property Acquired by the Regional
Transportation District from the Union Pacific Railroad was adopted by the RTD Board of Directors on
May 20, 2008 and provided that property acquired by the District from the UPRR pursuant to the
January 25, 2007 Agreement and not needed by the District for mass transit purposes would first be
offered to its original owners at the price paid by the UPRR plus direct expenses related to the transfer
of the property, and if not reacquired by the original owners on those terms would be marketed to obtain
the best price for the District. The owner of the property subject to this Board Action was notified of
the option to acquire the property back. The owner chose not to acquire the property at that time.
The subject property consist of a one story 3,688 square foot, single family residence which has been
substantially vandalized with two other vacant auxiliary houses and a small shed on 1.84 acres of
former residential property. Zoning of the property is I-2 (Heavy Industrial District) by the Town of Fort
Lupton.
DISCUSSION
An unsolicited offer to acquire was received on the property. An appraisal report was completed by an
independent appraiser, Sue Ann Foster, MAI, Foster Valuation Company LLC. Ms. Foster concluded an
opinion of the fair market value of the fee-simple interest in the subject property of $135,000 or 80,173
square feet at $2.25 per square foot ($180,389) less demolition costs of $45,000.

2.1

PROPOSED DISPOSITION PLAN: In accordance with Resolution No. 10, Series of 1984, Joint
Development and Disposition of Property Rights, the General Manager find that the RTD owned property

The appraisal report established a fair market value for the property. Mr. Robert Villano, Authorized
Manager of Villano Brothers Properties, Inc. represented by Mr. Peter G. Gunderson, Larry A. Cornell and
Mr. Bob Bruce, Esquire has agreed to enter into a Purchase and Sale Agreement for the appraised value.
The property will be sold “as is-where is”.
FINANCIAL IMPACT

Savings Account.

that the Board of Directors approve the proposed Disposition Plan for excess land for the 80,173
square feet (1.84 acres) net of county road right of way located at 13215 Weld County Road 8, Fort
Lupton, Colorado and further authorize the General Manager and/or his designee to negotiate and
execute a contract for the sale of the property.
2. Do not approve the proposed Disposition Plan for excess land for the 80,173 square feet (1.84
