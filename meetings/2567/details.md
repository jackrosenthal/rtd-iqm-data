#### 1. Civil Rights Committee Updates

Zamy Silva, Senior Manager of Civil Rights and Acting EEO Manager, indicated that the Civil Rights Division is currently updating their DBE Program Plan with the Federal Transit Administration (FTA).  The DBE Policy Statement was revised to reflect current staffing of David Genova – General Manager, Rolf Asphaug - General Counsel, and Zamy Silva – Acting EEO Manager.  The program plan updates also included changes to the UDDOT DBE Regulations, new RTD Triennial DBE Goal Methodology, and DBE contract procedures and provisions.

Zamy Silva added that RTD has received awards of recognition for small and disadvantaged business efforts in the community from:

- The Colorado Black Chamber of Commerce, who awarded RTD the Corporation of the Year Award;

- The Colorado Black Roundtable, who awarded RTD as a Champion of Black Economic Opportunities, and;

- The Rocky Mountain Indian Chamber of Commerce, who awarded RTD the Corporation of the Year Award

James Cook, Manager of Labor Relations, provided an update of the Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) training that the Civil Rights Department is currently presenting.  He noted that EEO is responsible for compliance with Federal, State and Local laws prohibiting unlawful workplace discrimination and harassment.

Director Folska questioned if it was necessary for RTD to have an EEO department.  She asked how Civil Rights differentiates from EEO, and if some of their functions could be handled through Human Resources.

James Cook noted that the FTA recommends that companies have their own EEO department.  He added that the FTA has also regulated that EEO departments be separate from Human Resources.

Chair Tobiassen asked what is the minimum age for discrimination.

James Cook said anyone over 40 can claim discrimination.

Director Francone commented that she would like to attend one of the EEO Discrimination and Harassment presentations.

Director Sisk requested the number of violations that have been reported to the EEO office within the last year, and asked how many of those resulted in disciplinary actions or terminations.

James Cook remarked that he did not have the exact numbers with him, but in most cases, staff does not find evidence of discrimination.  He stated that the number of complaints compared to the number of findings is very disproportionate, and less than 10% result in a finding.

Committee Chair Deadwyler thanked staff for the presentation and providing the Board with an update.  She added that this will be the final Civil Rights Committee meeting for 2016, and stated that the Board will determine when the committee will meet again.
