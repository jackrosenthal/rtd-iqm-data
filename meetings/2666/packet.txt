RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Nominating Committee for the RTD Citizens Advisory Committee of the
Regional Transportation District (RTD) that the RTD Board of Directors reappoint two members of the
Committee to an additional three-year term, appoint three new members to the Committee to three-year
terms and appoint one new member to the Committee to a one-year term as identified in this Report.
BACKGROUND
The Regional Transportation District (RTD) Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) is made up of residents
from around the region. Members are appointed by RTD Board of Directors and volunteer their time to
advise the District on a range of issues that affect citizens and impact the region.
Five current members’ terms expire on May 31, 2017. Additionally, one member whose term expires
May 31, 2018 has resigned creating an additional vacancy.
Recruitment for citizens interested in serving was publicly advertised through the RTD Web site, local
publications and stakeholder e-mail distributions beginning April 26, 2017. Applicants were asked to
submit a letter stating why they want to serve on the committee and what unique experience and skillsets they bring; describing affiliations and volunteer activities they believe will add value to the
committee; and a statement of personal objectives/goals if accepted for CAC membership.
A total of 23 applications were received by the May 14,2017 deadline. Three current members are
eligible for reappointment and two of the three expressed an interest in continuing to serve on the
Committee.
The Nominating Committee decided, based on attendance, participation at meetings and Committee
consistency to recommend reappointment of the two current members who requested reappointment.

GM

Date:

May 31, 2017

Subject:

Approval of 2017-2021 Bridge Inspections
Budget Request

General

Board Meeting Date: June 27, 2017

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to execute a threeyear contract, with two one-year optional extensions, for On-Call Bridge Inspections with Alfred Benesch
& Company, in a dollar amount not to exceed $1,560,900. Funding for the first year of this action is
$205,700 and is included in the 2017 Adopted Budget.
BACKGROUND
RTD owns and is responsible for the inspection of 88 bridges including Light Rail bridges, Pedestrian
bridges and Denver Union Station’s Commuter Rail and Amtrak bridges. RTD is also responsible for the
inspection of 14 Freight Rail bridges on the Southwest Corridor through construction agreements made
with the railroads when the corridor was built. Inspection of Commuter Rail bridges on the Eagle Project
is the responsibility of Denver Transit Operators.
Capital Programs Engineering Division has managed regularly scheduled bridge inspections for Southwest
Corridor Freight Rail bridges since 2002, Pedestrian bridges since 2010, and Light Rail bridges since
2014 (previously managed by Rail Ops since 2005). These bridge inspections were made by a subconsultant to an on-call engineering services prime consultant through 2016.
Bridge inspections are made with the purpose of detecting structure deterioration and damage, for which
repairs and maintenance are then made to correct. These measures help to assure that the bridges are
safe to carry the loads they were designed for through their intended life. The Commuter Rail and
Freight Rail bridges are inspected annually by mandate of the Federal Railroad Administration; Light Rail
bridges are inspected biannually in compliance with American Public Transportation Association
guidelines; RTD’s pedestrian bridges are inspected biannually in accordance with CDOT bridge inspection
policy.
RTD contracts this work to a qualified bridge inspection consultant. Bridge inspectors are required to
have completed National Bridge Inspection Standards training, including an 80-hour primary course and
appropriate supplemental courses. Bridge inspection team leaders are in addition required to be
registered professional engineers. In addition to performing regularly scheduled bridge inspections, the
inspection consultant provides a directory of on-call staff available at all times for emergency
inspections.
Many of the bridges, particularly the pedestrian bridges, require the use of a bucket truck with up to 80foot reach to access portions of the bridge that can’t be viewed otherwise; this in turn requires the use
of traffic control on the highways below. The average annual budget for the bridge inspections,
including inspection staff, access equipment, traffic control, and other costs, is about $312,180.

Packet Pg. 6

1.B.2

DISCUSSION
RTD bridge inspection’s discovery of structure damage that required substantial repairs has occurred at
the LRT over Alameda Avenue bridge, where heavily corroded steel column bases required repair by steel
treatment and concrete encasement to preserve and strengthen the deteriorated columns, and at the
LRT over Belleview Avenue bridge, where excessive and progressive deflection of under-designed
retaining walls at the bridge abutments required repair by installation of ground anchors through the
walls to prevent further displacement and possible failure. Numerous other repairs of less critical
conditions have been initiated by the bridge inspection program, including some which may have
circumvented more costly repairs in the future.
INSPECTION CONSULTANT SELECTION
RTD’s Request for Proposals for the bridge inspections was publicly advertised and resulted in submittals
from three consulting engineering firms that regularly perform bridge inspections for various public
agencies. Technical appraisal of the proposals was made by an evaluation team comprised of RTD
engineering staff using specific evaluation criteria listed in the Request for Proposals. Commitment to
fulfilling the required Small Business Enterprise goal was evaluated by the RTD Small Business Office.
Due to close scores in the proposals evaluation, each of the proposing companies was brought in for
interviews with RTD staff from Engineering, Purchasing, and the Small Business Office. At the end of
the selection process Alfred Benesch & Company was determined as the firm most qualified to fulfill the
requirements of this contract.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The RTD 2017 Adopted Budget includes $205,700 to fund the first year of this contract. Funding for
the following two years of the contract and the two one-year optional extensions was included in the
2017-2022 Strategic Budget Plan. (The average annual budget amount is $312,180; alternating years
vary significantly due mainly to costs of about $110,000 per inspection cycle for access equipment and
traffic control for the biannual pedestrian bridge inspections.)
SBE GOAL
The SBE Goal for this project was established by the RTD Small Business Office as 5% of the contracted
work cost. The bridge inspection consultant has stated in their proposal for this contract that the SBE
Goal will be met through the use of technical services subcontractors for portions of the work.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the recommended action. It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs &
FasTracks Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee,
to execute all documents necessary to execute the three-year contract, with two one-year
optional extensions, for On-Call Bridge Inspections in a dollar amount not to exceed $1,560,900.
Funding for the first year of this action is $205,700 and is included in the 2017 Adopted Budget
2. Do not accept the recommended action. Discontinue RTD bridge inspections in disregard of
federal regulations and other agencies’ policies; do not monitor bridge conditions, and do not
provide maintenance and repairs, as need for this work would not be known.

1.B.2

3. Perform bridge inspections using RTD staff. This is not recommended as it: 1) Would require
additional staff to supplement current structural engineering staff; 2) Would require over 100
hours standard bridge inspection training, which is not readily available and typically not available
locally, for each inspector; 3) Would substantially interfere with day-to-day engineering work,
especially during pedestrian bridge inspections to efficiently use rented access equipment; 4)
Would subject RTD to risk and liability in working over state and interstate highways; 5) Would
generally be significantly less efficient for RTD than contracting a specialized and experienced
bridge inspection consultant

Contract Award to Parsons Transportation
Group for the SH 119 Bus Rapid Transit
Corridor

Assistant

General

Board Meeting Date: June 27, 2017

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager to approve a professional services contract award to
Parsons Transportation Group to serve as the Contractor for assistance in the preparation of National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review and Preliminary Engineering (PE) services for the SH 119
Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) corridor for an amount not to exceed $3,250,000. Funding for this contract
is included in the 2017 Adopted Budget for the SH 119 BRT project.
BACKGROUND
RTD initiated the Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS), in April 2013. The purpose of the study
was to develop consensus among RTD, the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) and the
Northwest-area stakeholders, including local jurisdictions and businesses, on cost effective and
efficient mobility improvements to serve the Northwest area. On June 24, 2014, the Board approved
a resolution which accepted the Final Consensus Statement as developed by the NAMS stakeholders
for priorities within the Northwest Study Area. One of the highest priorities, as described in the Final
Consensus Statement, was to proceed into advanced planning, environmental clearance and
preliminary engineering to establish Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) in the SH 119 Corridor from Longmont
to Boulder.
As part of the 2040 Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) process, the Denver Regional Council of
Governments (DRCOG) included the SH 119 BRT Corridor in the Fiscally Constrained 2040 RTP.
Inclusion of the corridor in the RTP is required before NEPA review can be completed. In order to
advance this effort, DRCOG awarded RTD $1 million in Transportation Improvement Program (TIP)
grant funds to help fund this study. The DRCOG TIP funds must be obligated by September 2017 or
they potentially could be rescinded.
The cost to establish BRT in the corridor is estimated to be approximately $57 million in 2013
dollars. Staff assumes that grants will provide funding for approximately half of this cost. The
Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) includes $60 million in Base System funds (with $30 million assumed to
be from grant sources) for construction of the corridor beginning in 2022.
DISCUSSION
RTD issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) in February 2017 for consultant services to assist with the
preparation of NEPA review and Preliminary Engineering (PE) services for the SH 119 BRT Corridor.
The RFP included a 22 percent Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) goal. A committee
comprised of representatives from RTD, CDOT and DRCOG staffs along with three representatives
from the respective local jurisdictions (City of Longmont, City of Boulder and Boulder County)
reviewed proposals submitted by consultant teams in a qualifications-based selection process. The
evaluation considered each team’s technical proposal in the areas of Key Personnel Qualifications,

Packet Pg. 9

1.B.3

Project Understanding and Approach, Team Qualifications, DBE Commitment, Schedule, and
Innovation. The five proposing teams were led by the following companies: CH2M Hill, David Evans,
HDR, Michael Baker, and Parsons Transportation Group.
The selection committee short-listed three teams for interviews and is now recommending that a
team led by Parsons Transportation Group be approved by the Board. The committee found that the
Parsons team had the most extensive BRT planning, environmental, design and implementation
experience. Staff is requesting that the Board approve this recommendation and authorize the
General Manager to negotiate a contract not to exceed $3,250,000. Upon successful negotiations,
the study will begin immediately and is expected to be completed by the end of 2019. As noted
above, the RFP established a 22 percent DBE goal. Parsons has committed to exceeding this with a
DBE commitment of almost 30 percent.
The final product of the study will be to provide RTD with the necessary NEPA review and sufficient
engineering design to render the corridor eligible for grant funding for construction. Specifically, the
Contractor/Consultant will assist RTD with providing NEPA evaluation for the corridor as well as PE
work.
Should RTD pursue BRT construction in this corridor after completion of the NEPA and PE work, the
SH 119 BRT project would be subject to future approval by the RTD Board. In addition, RTD might
be required to seek DRCOG SB 208 approval as this project may be defined as a fixed guideway
corridor project. The expectation is that the funding breakdown for future BRT construction in the
corridor would be as follows:



50 percent from RTD Base System Funds; and
50 percent from grant sources, such as DRCOG Transportation Improvement Program (TIP)
funds, and/or Federal Transit Administration (FTA) Small Starts funding.

Project construction could occur within the 2022 to 2025 timeframe. And, as noted, future Board
action would be required to approve construction of BRT in this corridor.
The proposed action fits within the General Manager Goal to Improve Service Delivery, specifically
the sub goal of enhancing or expanding operations, as the eventual completion of BRT in the SH 119
corridor will increase service reliability, ridership and cost effectiveness of the service.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for this study was provided through a transfer of $3.5 million from the Planning expense
grant project budget to a new capital project for the SH 119 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Corridor
through Board action on October, 25 2016. This transfer moved $1.5 million in funding that was
previously approved in the 2016 Amended Budget and advanced additional funding that had been
approved in the 2017-2022 SBP for 2017 and 2018. As noted, $1 million of this funding is being
provided by a DRCOG grant.

ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs &
FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to

review and Preliminary Engineering (PE) services for the SH 119 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT)
corridor for an amount not to exceed $3,250,000. Funding for this contract is included in the
2017 Adopted Budget for the SH 119 BRT project.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to approve a
30-month professional services contract award to Parsons Transportation Group to serve as
the Contractor for assistance in the preparation of National Environmental Policy Act (NE PA)
review and Preliminary Engineering services for the SH 119 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) corridor
for an amount not to exceed $3,250,000. This action is not recommended since it will delay
the procurement of consultant services for the SH 119 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) and will
jeopardize the $1 million in DRCOG TIP grant funding.

Approval to enter into an IGA with the City and
County of Denver to fund improvements to the
Free MetroRide

Assistant

General

Board Meeting Date: June 27, 2017

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the Board of Directors
approve this action to enter into an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with the City and County of
Denver for up to $1,500,000 to fund the implementation of transit priority measures that will improve
the travel time and reliability of the Free MetroRide service. Funding for this IGA is included in the 2017
Adopted Budget for the Free MetroRide project.
BACKGROUND
The Free MetroRide opened in 2014 as part of the FasTracks program to complement the 16th Street
Free MallRide (mall shuttle) and improve downtown circulation for people traveling to and from
downtown Denver via transit. The Free MetroRide currently operates during the AM and PM peak
periods on 18th/19th Streets and Broadway/Lincoln between the Union Station bus concourse and Civic
Center Station. The original project included the following transit priority measures to improve reliability
of the service as compared to typical RTD bus routes operating on downtown streets during peak
periods:






Four bus bulbs/islands on 18th Street
Bus/bike/HOV lane on 19th Street during the AM peak period
Transit queue jump signal on 18th Street at Glenarm
Multiple door boarding made possible with fare-free service
Dedicated stops every 2-3 blocks

The intent was that these priority measures would result in the Free MetroRide providing faster service
between Union Station and Civic Center Station than the mall shuttle. However, that is not always the
case especially during the PM peak period when traffic is heavier. The demand for peak period
circulation will continue to grow with the opening of the remaining FasTracks rail lines.
The Free MetroRide project was completed under budget due to cost savings realized by combining the
purchase of the 60’ low-floor buses with a larger order of 60’ buses for the rest of the District. A
portion of the remaining funding was reserved in the FasTracks Annual Program Evaluation (APE) for
future investment in the project to improve operations.

Packet Pg. 12

1.B.4

RTD and Denver staff identified the following potential transit priority measures to improve operations:
1. Bus priority and queue jump traffic signals at key intersections along the route
2. Traffic signal optimization for the Free MetroRide
3. Transit-Only lane on Broadway which would also benefit other RTD routes
4. 19th Street design changes including bus bulbs and separation of the bikes from the bus lane
5. 18th Street design changes including a protected bike lane and peak period bus lane
All of the potential improvements are projects that would require changes to Denver streets and/or
traffic signals. As such, RTD and Denver staff agreed that the most efficient way to complete the work
would be for Denver to take the lead and RTD to provide the funding. This will allow the projects to be
completed without requirements such as permitting fees for street closures that would be necessary if
Denver is not the lead agency. This IGA presented for approval outlines RTD and Denver responsibilities
for the Free MetroRide improvements.
RTD will provide up to $1.5 million of funding for feasibility analysis and implementation of the
improvements. It is anticipated that the feasibility analysis will be less than 20% of the total cost,
approximately $250,000. Most of the funding will go towards implementation. However, no RTD funds
will be spent on improvements that are not feasible or that do not provide operational benefits to the
Free MetroRide. Once the IGA is completed, Denver will begin the work by conducting feasibility
analyses. The IGA provides RTD the authority to determine which improvements will move forward for
implementation with the RTD funds. It is anticipated that the feasibility analysis for the first three
improvements will take no more than 12 months and implementation will begin soon thereafter.
Improvements four and five will require more extensive feasibility study, anticipated to take 18 months.
Per the IGA, the City will invoice RTD after completion of the feasibility analysis for each improvement.
For the implementation phase, the City can either invoice RTD monthly or after completion of an
individual improvement. RTD will hold retainage until final acceptance of each improvement.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The Free MetroRide capital funding from FasTracks is as follows:





Original Capital Budget (buses and stop improvements): $16.9 million
Actual Capital Expenditures for Original 2014 Project: $11.1 million
2015 Contribution to the FISA: $2.5 million
Remaining Funding in Free MetroRide Budget: $3.3 million

This IGA commits $1.5 million of the remaining funding available in the Free MetroRide capital budget.
The decision was made in 2015 to reserve a portion of the project budget for future capital investments
to improve operations so the the remaining budget was included in the APE for the Free MetroRide as
opposed to general FasTracks. The execution of this IGA will allow a portion of those remaining funds to
be used as planned. These funds have been appropriated in the 2017 Adopted Budget for the Free
MetroRide project.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks
Committee that the Board of Directors approve this action to enter into an Intergovernmental
Agreement (IGA) with the City and County of Denver for up to $1,500,000 to fund the
implementation of transit priority measures that will improve the travel time and reliability of the Free
MetroRide service. Funding for this IGA is included in the 2017 Adopted Budget for the Free

2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not approve the action to enter into an IGA with the
City and County of Denver and direct RTD staff to evaluate other options for completing the
planning, design and implementation of transit priority measures. This is not recommended as other
methods for implementing these projects will be more expensive and time consuming.
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not approve the action to enter into an IGA with the
City and County of Denver and do not invest capital to improve Free MetroRide operations. This is
not recommended as travel time savings and increased reliability have been identified as critical
components to ensure that the Free MetroRide achieves its goal of providing downtown passenger
circulation for patrons from across the District.

Southwest Chief and Front Range Passenger
Rail Commission Appointee

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager to appoint William C. Van Meter as the Regional Transportation District
Commissioner to the Southwest Chief and Front Range Passenger Rail Commission, created by the
Colorado General Assembly during the 2017 session.
BACKGROUND
During the Seventy First General Assembly, Senate Bill 17-153, Concerning establishment of the
Southwest Chief and Front Range Passenger Rail Commission to oversee the preservation and expansion
of Amtrak Southwest Chief Rail Service in Colorado and facilitate the development and operation of a
Front Range Passenger Rail System that provides passenger rail service in and along the Interstate 25
Corridor, was passed and signed by the Governor into law. This commission is created in the Colorado
Department of Transportation and consists of eleven commissioners, as listed below.
Five commissioners appointed by the Governor as follows:




Two public rail transportation advocates;
Two representatives of Class I freight railroads that serve Colorado;
One resident of Huerfano, Las Animas, Otero, Prowers, or Pueblo County who has publicly

passenger rail system that provides service in and along the I-25 corridor. The Commission must present

DISCUSSION
RTD has been advised that the RTD commissioner should be someone intrinsically involved in transit
planning in order to properly advise the Commission on how a Front Range Passenger Rail System will
interface with the RTD light and commuter rail systems. This Committee recommends William C. Van
Meter, Assistant General Manager of Planning to be the RTD commissioner on this commission.
Mr. Van Meter has been in a transportation planner at RTD since 1991 and was appointed to his current
position of Assistant General Manager, Planning in 2008. He holds Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in
Economic Geography from the University of Illinois and has over 28 years of experience in the
transportation planning field. He has extensive experience in public transit planning, leading multi-modal
transportation studies, and managing RTD’s New Starts and Small Starts grant funding processes with
the Federal Transit Administration. He has participated in various capacities in the planning for all of
RTD’s rail corridors. Mr. Van Meter currently serves on the Colorado Department of Transportation’s
Transit & Rail Advisory Committee and he is a non-voting member of the Denver Regional Council of
Governments Board of Directors.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Commissioners serve without compensation but receive reimbursement for expenses. RTD estimates
little fiscal impact to the budget except for the time involved in working with the Commission.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs &
FasTracks Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to appoint
William C. Van Meter as the Regional Transportation District Commissioner to the Southwest
Chief and Front Range Passenger Rail Commission, created by the Colorado General Assembly
during the 2017 session.
2.

Do not accept the Recommended Action. This option is not recommended because William C.
Van Meter is a well-qualified and knowledgeable individual who has been intrinsically involved
in planning all RTD rail projects.
