## II. June Board Meeting Agenda Review

Chair Sisk requested Interim General Manager Genova to review the agenda for the Board meeting.  It was noted that with the exception of the 2015 amended budget, all items had passed committee unanimously.

Motion:                Director Walker made the motion to move the June Board agenda forward for the June 16 Board meeting.

Director Hoy seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Chair Sisk noted under the GM Executive Search Committee that the listening sessions have been going fine and quite enjoyable.  Director Hoy commented that his session at Platte was outstanding.  He believes we should find a way to incorporate these types of forums with the employees periodically throughout the year.  Chair Sisk commented that a common theme has been silos and communications. The employees expressed appreciation for the Board members to offer these listening opportunities.  Interim General Manager Genova added that he has heard similar messages as well in the employee strategical survey and that staff is addressing this issue.

Paula Perdue shared there is an issue that is surfacing that is more for the GM Executive Search Committee but she wanted to communicate to the Executive Committee so they can be clear on the process.  The process followed by the GM Executive Search on inquiries or people wanting to apply is that all this will be channeled through the Executive Search Firm who will do the screening, etc.  This is to maintain fairness and equity in treatment across the board and that no one person is perceived to have an unfair access to Board members or advantage.  All of the input from the listening sessions, focus groups, CAC meeting, and the input from the Board will be funneled into a candidate profile that will be used by the Executive Search firm.  Right now she is holding all inquiries or communications in the Board office until the Executive Search firm is hired, targeted around July 7th.  Board members should continue to refer interested parties to her until the Executive Search firm is hired.  This process allows the Board members to have clean hands and ensure everyone is treated equitably.

Director Hoy commented it is important that we set the expectations for day pass printers on day 1.  Interim General Manager Genova noted they are having these discussions.

Interim General Manager Genova indicated he will have several items to share under the General Manager Report.  One such item is the Clinton Global Initiative which Marla Lien, General Counsel, participated in this week.

Director Walker noted he will be doing an update on the APTA Board seminar under old business.

Vote on the

Motion:              The motion passed.

Chair Sisk Declared the motion PASSED.

## III. Other Matters

- Director Walker shared he will be meeting with the Urban Peak organization which is located in his district to talk about fares.  He considers this a listening session.

- Interim General Manager Genova shared three things:

o        The MAX group will be meeting during the same time as the APTA Board Seminar. They will be having events including inviting Chair Sisk to do a welcome on July 20 which is a conflict with the APTA session.

o        Meeting with Affordable-income taskforce—The staff has met with the leader for Mile High Connects who appears to have a different perception of the commitments made by RTD.  Staff will continue to work on gaining clarity and understanding of how we can partner together with this taskforce.  Director Hoy conveyed his position that while RTD is willing to work with these organizations to provide options for the transit-dependent poor, RTD does not have a coffer to finance these subsidies.  Chair Sisk added this is a complicated issue and that while our objective is to work with these organizations, he sees it more as issues affecting how to improve the distribution channels of our low-income fare program.  We need to separate out the structure issues from this next phase dealing with this. Director Walker commented his concern is in using percentages as that gap could widen over time.  He referred to the King County model that does not use percentages.

o        Interim General Manager Genova shared that RTD will have lots of visibility at the APTA Rail Conference.  A number of staff members will be presenters and RTD will receive the APTA Gold Award for safety.  The two Board members in attendance (Anderson and Bagley) will be asked to accept these awards along with staff on behalf of the agency.  He will be there but will leave early to attend the CDOT event on Monday.

- Chair Sisk referenced the CDOT opening and stated that he and Paula have been in discussion about protocols when an event is in a respective district.  In this case, this is not a RTD hosted event but a CDOT event and he was contacted directly by CDOT as the Chair of the Board.  Nevertheless, we need to be clear on our protocols for including Board members on events occurring in their respective districts. This will be most important for the 2016 opening.  Paula Perdue added that while some of the events may not be hosted by RTD, this is an opportunity for our PI department to help communicate to these other organizations that we do have protocols and to suggest we should include the Directors representing these respective districts.

- Director Walker shared that former General Manager Washington had invited him to be a member of the APTA Nominating Committee and he will be attending a meeting around August 21 or 22.
