DISCUSSION
Overview of the 2015 Budget Amendment
The total proposed appropriation for the 2015 Amended Budget and the changes from the 2015
Adopted Budget are summarized in the first set of tables above.
2015 Operating Expense Adjustments
The operating and administrative expense portion of the proposed budget amendment reflects an
increase of $37.0 million from the 2015 Adopted Budget. This increase consists of $4.2 million on the
Base System, $32.1 million in FasTracks Project/Construction, and $0.8 million in FasTracks Operations
(West Line, Denver Union Station, and Free MetroRide). Of the total increase, $13.7 million is attributed
to previously approved transfers primarily for the FasTracks Eagle and I-225 Rail Line projects, and
$17.3 million is attributed to third-party betterments on I-225 and North Metro projects (funded by
capital contributions). On the Base System, the true increase to operating expenses is less than 1% net
of previously approved transfers and one-time expenses.
Shown in detail on the attached Amendment A, major changes are summarized below.

General Counsel
 Net increase of $0.045 million for additional funds for legal services for aviation fuel tax matter
offset by previously approved transfers.
Finance and Administration-Base
 Net increase of $1.3 million from increased IT costs due to conversion of 9 temporary IT employees

Debt Service
Interest expense is projected to decline $2.1 million on a combined basis from the Adopted Budget due
to unused debt proceeds from previous debt issues available for use in 2015 on the Base system that
will reduce the amount of planned debt issuance and budgeted interest expense. Principal payments on
debt are projected to decrease $3.5 million for the same reason. Interest expense and principal
payments on FasTracks will remain stable. Capitalized interest is expected to show no change.

2.12.A

2015 New Capital
The new capital portion of the proposed amended budget reflects a net increase of $99.4 million over
the 2015 Adopted Budget. These changes result from program changes that have occurred since the
2015 Budget was adopted, and include the following significant changes:
Base System
New capital changes consist of an increase in Base of $12.7 million. Additions to new capital funding
include $3.8 million added for SmartCard stored value card implementation work and $1.9 million added
for thermal printers for buses, and $5.7 million in restoration of funding for the mall shuttles purchase
that was subject of a budget transfer for the SmartCard activity and thermal printers. Other changes
include $1.2 million in Disaster Recovery funds (budget transfer approved by the Board in April 2015).
Please see Attachment B for detail.
FasTracks
New capital changes to FasTracks consist of an increase of $86.8 million. This results from updated
project schedules for the Eagle and I-225 projects that changed the projected expenditures in 2015,
adjustments for grant funding, changes in cost estimates, and corrections to the Adopted Budget.
Additions to new capital funding include $11.9 million for the East Corridor, $6.9 million for the Gold
Line, $63.6 million for the I-225 Rail Line, $3.4 million for Northwest Rail, and $7.0 million for two new
light rail vehicles for I-225. Please see Attachment B for detail and Program Capital attached.
Previously Approved Capital Carryforward Adjustments
For the 2015 Adopted Budget, year-to-date actual expenditures as of 9/30/14 were used to compute the
estimate of the carryforward. This methodology is used to accommodate the timing of the adoption of
the annual budget. For the 2015 Amended Budget, year-to-date actual expenditures as of 12/31/14
were used to compute the estimate of the carryforward. This takes into account expenditures that were
made in the last quarter of 2014.
Previously approved capital carryforward is decreased by $315.9 million from the 2015 Adopted Budget
to reflect fourth quarter 2014 actual expenditures, transfers to reclassify certain capital projects as
expense projects, previously approved transfers, completion of projects, and project scope changes.
The Base System portion is a decrease of $67.9 million and the FasTracks decrease is $248.0 million.
Please see Attachment C for detail and Program Capital attached.
Revenue Changes
In the Amended Budget, revenues are projected to increase $16.7 million on a combined basis from the
2015 Adopted Budget.



Sales and Use Tax revenues are projected to decrease $16.2 million based on the CU-Leeds
School March forecast of 7.1% vs. 5.9% in the Adopted Budget.
Federal grant revenues, including operating grants, capital grants, capital maintenance, FASTER
grants, CMAQ grants, and other grants are projected to remain stable over amounts projected in
the 2015 Adopted Budget. This reflects a decrease of $12.9 million in allocations on the Base
System in capital maintenance, fixed guideway, CMAQ grants, and carryforward grants from the

Packet Pg. 14

2.12.A




2015 Adopted Budget, offset by increases in Bus Facilities funding, FTA Ladders of Opportunity
grants, and certain CDOT grants. FasTracks allocated grants are expected to increase $13.4
million due to increases in CMAQ grants for the Eagle project, STAMPS grants, and FASTER
grants for the US36 project.
Fare revenue is projected to remain flat in the Amended Budget over the Adopted Budget based
on current year actuals run rate.
Other income is projected to remain stable at $11.0 million.

Unrestricted Year-End Fund Balance

The Unrestricted Year-End Fund Balance is projected to increase $3.3 million from the Adopted
Budget to $16.0 million reflecting amended budget increases offset by increases in revenue.
FasTracks Contingency Reserve
The proposed 2015 Amended Budget reflects continued maintenance of the FasTracks Contingency
Reserve at a balance of $30 million. This reserve is appropriated annually, and is used to fund any
changes in the FasTracks schedule that could not be forecast at the time of adoption of the annual
budget. The purpose of this reserve is to allow the District to accommodate minor changes to the
FasTracks schedule without requiring frequent budget amendments to draw funds from the FasTracks
Future Construction Reserve. The Reserve has been carried at $30 million since 2010 and remains at
that level in both this Amended Budget and the 2015 Adopted Budget.
The FasTracks Construction Reserve at $100 million is split between the Construction Reserve at $60
million and a Start-up Operations Reserve at $40 million. The Start-up Operations Reserve was
established in the FasTracks Annual Program Evaluation for the years 2015-2016 in order to meet the
1.2x debt service coverage if needed.
Budget Transfers
The proposed 2015 Amended Budget reflects year-to-date budget transfers executed within the General
Manager’s authority or by prior authorization of the Board of Directors. The District’s budget transfer
policy was adopted by the Board of Directors on 2/26/85 and further amended on 1/1/93, 5/15/08 and
4/1/10. The policy states that cumulative transfers between projects in amounts exceeding $250,000
require prior approval of the Board of Directors.
Cost Recovery Ratio
The proposed 2015 Amended Budget meets the cost recovery ratio mandated by the Colorado General
Assembly. The estimated SB154 recovery ratio (all nontax revenue except ADA farebox revenues
divided by all expenditures, including depreciation, except ADA expenditures and expenditures incurred
for long-term planning and development of rapid transit infrastructure) exceeds the annual target of 30%
mandated by the General Assembly. The RTD operating revenue recovery ratio (operating revenues
except ADA farebox revenues divided by the same cost basis as the Colorado General Assembly) is
estimated to exceed the 20% target established by the Board of Directors.

Packet Pg. 15

2.12.A

Fund Balance Policy
The proposed 2014 Amended Budget includes a reserve of 3% of annual spending as defined in Article
X, Section 20 of the Colorado Constitution (the TABOR reserve). The proposed 2015 Amended Budget
maintains a Board-Appropriated Fund, Capital Replacement Fund, and Unrestricted Year-End Fund
balance in the District's working capital. The objective is for the total of these three funds to equal
approximately three months of operating expenses excluding depreciation for the Base System and two
months of same for FasTracks. The contributions to the Board-Appropriated Fund and Capital
Replacement Fund on the Base System will continue at $3.0 million to each fund in 2015.
Basis of Accounting and Budgeting
The accounts of the District are reported using the accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are
recognized when earned and expenses are recognized when incurred. The District’s basis of budgeting
follows the accrual basis of accounting except (1) capital outlays and payments of principal are treated
as expenditures, and (2) depreciation and gains and losses on disposal of property and equipment are
excluded.

ALTERNATIVES
1. Amend the 2015 Budget to reflect the capital project changes and the adjustments to the operating
budget. This is the recommended action.
2. Request staff to revise the proposed amendments to the 2015 Budget and amend the budget with
revisions.
3. Do not amend the 2015 Budget. This is not recommended, because the 2015 Adopted Budget does
not reflect the capital carryforward adjustments, capital budget adjustments, and material changes to
the operating and administrative budget.

Authorization to Enter Into Contract with INIT
for Purchase of Day Pass Printers

CFO/AGM,

Finance

&

Board Meeting Date: June 16, 2015

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the Interim General Manager or his designee to enter into a $2,700,000 sole source contract
with INIT Innovations in Transportation, Inc. (INIT) for purchase, integration and installation of equipment
and software necessary to accommodate the sale of day-pass fare media under the newly adopted fare
structure (Contract Number 15DH072). This contract will include integration with the Computer Aided
Dispatch/ Automatic Vehicle Location (CAD/AVL) system, interface changes for the new fare structure,
parking pass validation and a 3-year extended warranty.
BACKGROUND
RTD recently adopted a modified and simplified fare structure to be enacted in January 2016. Under the
new fare structure, many transfers are eliminated and a day pass will be offered to customers for
purchase on board RTD buses. The day passes are priced at two times the single fare and would allow
a customer to have unlimited rides during a service day, thereby not requiring a rider to purchase a fare
at each transfer. Paper transfers would no longer be needed.
DISCUSSION
In order to make the day pass widely available to RTD’s patrons, the ability to purchase day passes is
needed at the location where a patron accesses RTD’s services either on buses or at rail platforms. RTD
currently has the ability to sell day passes at rail platforms through ticket vending machines (TVMs) and
at sales outlets but currently does not have the ability to offer day passes to patrons who purchase their
first fare upon entering a bus. In order to offer a day pass on buses, a printer would be installed in each
bus whereby a customer would pay for the day pass through the farebox and the operator would
produce a day pass from the onboard printer. The day pass will be printed on watermarked paper and
would clearly indicate the service day for which it is valid.
In addition to the Day Pass Printer and software, the scope of work for this procurement includes having
the Day Pass Printer also function as a Parking Pass Validation printer. The scope of work includes
driver interface changes to activate the printer and Smart Media Technology (SMT) driver interface
changes required for the new fare structure.
INIT is the company providing our CAD/AVL system. They have onboard printer and software that
meets our needs and integrates with the existing system. These printers are in use by Tri-Met in
Portland, OR and RTD staff saw them in use during their visit to Portland. A sole source justification
memo for this procurement has been prepared and approved by Legal Counsel. This procurement meets
the sole source criteria in the RTD "Procurement Standards Manual" revised September 2014.
Soul Source Criteria: Unique Capability

Packet Pg. 39

2.13.B

With multiple types of Day Passes anticipated and a need for a daily security code printed on each ticket
that is known to all drivers, but not passengers, customized and centralized pass printing software will
be needed for whatever printer is chosen. INIT has already developed printer software that is
programmable through the central system. No other vendor would be able to provide this type of central
system interface and remote reprogramming of the onboard system. Any other vendor would require
that new ticket information be reprogrammed by visiting each of RTD’s 1045 onboard computers with a
new data file. This level of labor effort is substantial and not properly staffed to be available for this
purpose.
Sole Source Criteria: Duplication of Costs
An onboard computer is needed to create and send a file to print. This computer is already available
onboard from the INIT CAD/AVL system. Providing an additional onboard computer would cost over
$2,200,000 to furnish and install an onboard computer, hardened to operate in a transit environment.
Additionally, a different onboard computer would require information that is available in the current INIT
CAD/AVL system. So, a different onboard computer would need to have an interface developed to the
INIT system. This would require customized software and interface development assistance from INIT.
Past experience indicates that onboard interface development is about 3 months of development work,
which is duplication of cost that is not needed with this sole source.
Sole Source Criteria: Prevention of Acceptable Delay
This is one of the most compelling justifications for a sole source for this project. The Board directs
starting the new fare structure on January 1, 2016. This is only seven (7) months after the Board made
its decision on the new fare structure. Going to a competitive procurement will take at least three (3)
months, and likely longer, to select a contractor, negotiate and execute a contract. Manufacturing and
shipping 1043 printers will take over five (5) months. Even with pre-wiring, installation of 1043 printers
will take an additional month. So, with only 7 months to procure and implement this six-month project,
a competitive procurement is not feasible.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The estimated cost of installing thermal printers on each of the 1,043 revenue buses currently in the
RTD fleet is $1,900,000. This cost includes required software and equipment, as well as the
connections and installation necessary to tie the printers into the RTD network and a 3-year extended
warranty. The estimate for Parking Pass Validation is $20,000 and the estimate for the driver interface
changes is $450,000.
Budget Source
Board Funded from Certificate of Participation transfer authorized May 2015
CAD/AVL funds for interface, integration and new fare policy changes
Facility Maintenance funds for Parking validation
Operating Expenses: spare hardware, 3-year extended warranty and software
maintenance

Amount
$1,900,000
$450,000
$20,000
$330,000
$2,700,000

The Board previously authorized the funding necessary for the purchase of the thermal printer units by
transferring a portion of the Certificate of Participation (COP) proceeds issued in 2013 for the

Packet Pg. 40

2.13.B

replacement of Mall Shuttles – those Mall Shuttle funds will be backfilled with the 2015 COP issuance
expected to occur in August. Funding for parking validation requirements will come from the Facilities
Maintenance budget. Interfaces changes with the CAD/AVL system will be funded with remaining
budget from the Radio and CAD/AVL Replacement Project. Extended warranty funding will come from
2017 through 2019 Operational Budget. Therefore, there is no need to seek additional funding for this
procurement and no budgetary impact other than the transfer of funds from one project to another.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the Interim General Manager or his designee to execute a contract with INIT in order
to purchase and install the equipment necessary to accommodate the sale of day passes
under the proposed 2016 fare structure. This is the recommended action.
2. Do not authorize the Interim General Manager or his designee to execute a contract with INIT
to purchase and install the equipment necessary to accommodate the sale of the day pass.
This action would result in RTD’s inability to procure needed day pass printer equipment in
time to provide the ability for patrons to purchase day passes on buses and avoid multiple fare
payments for transfers. This is not the recommended action.

Contract

for

External

Audit

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorizes the General Manager to execute all documents necessary to award a contract to RubinBrown,
LLP to perform RTD’s annual external audit services. The contract is awarded for audit services for
calendar years 2015, 2016 and 2017 in the amount of $333,500. There is an option to extend the
contract for two additional one year periods, at RTD’s discretion, in the amount of $239,500.
BACKGROUND
According to Section 12 of Article VII of the RTD Bylaws, “The Board of Directors shall cause an
examination of the District’s financial statements to be made in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards following the end of each fiscal year. One certified copy of said audit shall be filed
with the office of the State Auditor. The audit shall be performed by an independent Certified Public
Accountant retained by the Board of Directors at the sole discretion for this or any other purpose they
deem necessary. The auditor shall provide a signed auditor’s opinion as to the fair presentation of the
financial position of the District, the results of RTD operations and changes in its financial position for
the fiscal year ended. The Board of Directors shall cause such other audits to be made as it deems
necessary, utilizing the Internal Audit staff or independent auditor as it alone shall determine.” In
addition, the District is required by the Single Audit Act of 1984 and certain debt and lease covenants to
have an independent audit of other selected information. Additional external audit services include an
annual review of information provided for the National Transit Database as well as a review of the
General Manager’s contract.
DISCUSSION
The current RTD contract for external audit services expires on June 30, 2015. RubinBrown is the
incumbent firm and has provided external audit services to RTD for the past four years after an
acquisition of the preceding contractor, Bondi and Co. RubinBrown will continue to rotate audit
engagement partners, managers and staff on a periodic basis in keeping with auditing best practices.
RTD issued a best value request for proposals to provide external audit services and received five
proposals from the following firms:
 BKD
 Clifton Larson
 Crowe Horwath
 McGladrey
 RubinBrown

Packet Pg. 42

2.13.C

The proposals were evaluated with the following criteria:
40% - Qualifications of individuals proposed for key positions and disciplines
30% - Overall experience of the firm
30% - Cost
The proposal evaluation committee determined that RubinBrown had the best overall proposal.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding of $108,000 for the 2015 fiscal year audit will be included in the 2016 Budget. Funding for
external audit services is an annual recurring expenditure that is regularly included in the budget and SBP
process.

ALTERNATIVES
1) Approve the recommendation to the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the
Board of Directors authorizes the General Manager to execute all documents necessary to
award a contract to RubinBrown, LLP to perform RTD’s annual external audit services. This is
the recommended action.
2) Do not approve the recommendation to the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors authorizes the General Manager to execute all documents necessary to
award a contract to RubinBrown, LLP to perform RTD’s annual external audit services. This is
not the recommended action because it will delay having an external auditor available and
staff has found RubinBrown, LLP to have the best overall proposal.

August 2015 Service Changes

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the August 2015 Service Change package as revised and summarized in Attachment A resulting
in an annualized cost of approximately $279,000 and, further, to authorize the General Manager or his
designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is impacted
by these changes.
DISCUSSION
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. We will continue adjusting services in
response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. It is also
our responsibility to identify services that are underperforming and recommend modifications,
curtailment or cancellation of service as warranted. The proposals herein include a mix of service
enhancements, routine schedule adjustments and several service reductions. Also included in this report
are two proposals implementing service at new facilities slated to be open in time for the August service
change. Boulder Junction at Depot Square (33rd – Pearl Street) is scheduled to be opened with
accompanied changes to existing route services: HX and S and Central Park Station Bus Plaza and parkn-Ride will replace the existing Stapleton park-n-Ride with accompanied changes to existing route
services: 28, 38, 40, 43, 65, 73, 88, 89, 105, AB and AS. We will monitor customer response to the
implementation of these service changes and propose adjustments and service alternatives as
appropriate in future service change recommendations.
The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
 Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
 Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
SUMMARY OF PUBLIC HEARINGS
Seven public hearings were held during the public comment period, which extended between May 27th
and June 3rd. Public meetings were held in Aurora, Denver, Boulder, Lakewood and Highlands Ranch.
Comments from these meetings and the service change website are summarized in Attachment B of this
report.

CHANGES TO INITIAL RECOMMENDATIONS
Staff receives input during the public comment process and continues to conduct additional analysis
after the initial service recommendations are communicated to the Board of Directors. Depending on the
outcome of the public comment process and continued analysis, staff may or may not propose
modifications to these initial recommendations. The following represent substantive changes proposed to
the service changes initially communicated to the Board of Directors for implementation as part of the
August 2015 service change:
Route 9 – West 10th Avenue: extend selected morning peak trips to 31st Brighton to relieve overloads

(Route 43 school tripper service replaced by increased frequency on the Route 43)
Routes BOUND, DASH, JUMP, SKIP and STAMPEDE: Change to fall/winter schedules.
Route N – Nederland/Boulder: reinstate routing to Eldora Ski Resort.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The base system financial impact contained in this proposal is estimated to be $279,000 annualized.
EQUITY ANALYSIS
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and
Executive Order 12898 regarding Environmental Justice. In this circular, the FTA requires RTD to
evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that exceed the established major service
change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a disproportionately negative impact on
minority or low-income populations. Our evaluation of the proposed August 2015 service changes does
not reveal any disparities in impacts absorbed by minority or low-income populations.
LOOK AHEAD – January 17, 2016
The following items are service concepts currently under consideration or are planned events that impact
operations in the next service change period:
 US36 BRT Service Plan restructures the majority of Regional Service aligned along US 36
into the Flatiron Flyer Bus Rapid Transit service.




Route 79L/83L rescheduling and rebranding to simplify customer information in the
Speer/Leetsdale corridor.
Route 6 restructure creating a distinct east-west service (Route 6) and a north-south
service to be named the Route 19 – North Pecos.
Grant funded peak period service increase on the Free MetroRide

Route 1 – West 1st Avenue
An all-day vehicle is proposed to be added to Route 1, due to the proposal on the Route
26, which results in a break of the interline between Route 1 and 26. Anticipated cost
impacts are estimated to be $165,300 annualized.
Route 1W – West 1st Avenue
In conjunction with the discontinuance of the Route 9 school tripper, it is proposed to
reroute Route 1W to operate on Knox Ct between 6th Ave and 10th Ave, 10th Ave between
Knox Ct and Decatur St, and Decatur St between 8th Ave and 10th Ave. The remaining
route will be unchanged. Route 1W will be scheduled to arrive at West High School at
7:20am and depart at 3:40pm. Anticipated cost estimated to be $2,600 annualized.
Route 3L – East Alameda Limited
Minor schedule adjustments are proposed to improve on-time performance. No cost
impacts are anticipated.
Route 6 – East 6th Avenue/ North Pecos
It is proposed to realign Route 6 to stay on Navajo St between 32nd Ave and 34th Ave.
Drainage has been improved in this area and the street is no longer a hazard in freezing
temperatures. No cost impacts anticipated.
Route 8 – North Broadway / Huron
It is proposed to return the southbound terminal of Route 8 to 13th/Welton during weekday
evenings and on weekends. It is also proposed to discontinue Route 8 service to Denver
Water, with all trips terminating at 13th/Welton. Service to Denver Water is proposed to be
provided by an improved Route 34 (proposed Route 33). Anticipated cost savings are
estimated to be $31,000 annualized.
Route 9 – West 10th Avenue
Due to low ridership, it is proposed to discontinue the Route 9 school tripper starting at
Lakewood-Wadsworth Station at 6:22am. The Route 9 will also be extended from Larimer20th Street to 31st –Brighton Boulevard to address overloads currently being experienced
on the Route 48 – East 48th Ave/Commerce City.

during late night periods in the Downtown area. No cost impacts are anticipated.

Route 9 - West 10th Avenue
Route 26 – West 26th Avenue
Route 28 – 28th Avenue
Route 76 _ Wadsworth Crosstown
This proposal recombines Routes 26 and 28 at Wadsworth Boulevard. A new routing to
turnaround the Route 9 is proposed using 14th Avenue to Pierce Street to 10th Avenue.
Additional Sunday service is proposed to be added to Route 76 to maintain an appropriate
service frequency along Wadsworth Boulevard in Lakewood.
Anticipated net cost savings is estimated to be $195,000 annualized
Route 10 – East 12th Avenue
Minor schedule adjustments are proposed to improve on-time performance. No cost
impacts are anticipated.
Route 12 – Downing/North Washington
Discontinue 6:07pm southbound trip from Corona/Colfax to Englewood Station. Trip
averages between 8-14 boardings per hour. This proposal reduces frequency south of
Colfax from every 15 to every 30 minutes between 6:00pm and 6:30pm. A reroute
northbound buses to remain on Downing Street at the 30th & Downing LRT Station is also
proposed. The northbound stop at 29th Avenue is very convenient to the station platform.
This proposal reduces travel time by approximately 3 minutes and eliminates a very
difficult left turn from California Street onto Downing. Anticipated cost savings are
estimated to be $8,200 annualized.
Route 15 – East Colfax
Route 15L – East Colfax Limited
Route 20 – 20th Avenue
Discontinue Route 15 deviation into the Anschutz Medical Campus on Saturday and
Sunday. Route averages only one boarding or alighting for every 3 bus trips on weekends.
Route 20 will continue to provide direct campus service.
Discontinue Route 15 deviation south of Colfax via Sable, 13th Avenue, and
Chambers Road. Area is well served by Route 15L on Sable and Route 153 on Chambers
Road. Also discontinue loop via Chambers, 17th Avenue, and Jasper Street.
Extend Route 15 directly east on Colfax Avenue, continuing east to Himalaya
Street, replacing Route 15L Tower Road branch. Route 15 service to Tower Road will
include Saturday/Sunday/holidays, as elimination of deviations should allow this extension
at no additional operating cost. (Note: Saturday service will be every 15 minutes as far
east as Billings Street, then every 30 minutes to Tower Road. Sunday/holiday service will
be every 30 minutes).
Route 15L Tower Road branch trips will be cut back to terminate/originate at
Colfax/Billings (East Metro Garage). Service east of Sable Blvd. is replaced by extended
Route 15. Current Route 15L service to Centrepoint & Sable will remain unchanged.

anticipated to be an estimated $2,580 annualized.
Route 30L – Federal Boulevard Limited
This proposal re-aligns the service in the downtown area to be routed along Stout Street in
the place of Welton Street, but utilizes the same terminal at 22nd Champa. This new
alignment should provide more consistent operation of this service, thereby improving ontime performance. No cost impact anticipated.
Route 31 – Federal Boulevard
Minor schedule adjustments are proposed during the early morning and late night periods
to better coordinate connections with Route 16. It is proposed to move the afternoon
northbound school tripper to start at Federal/Evans at 3:21pm from 3:17pm.
It is proposed to shift the times of the afternoon southbound school trippers to leave
Federal/32nd at 2:55pm and 4:05pm in order to better match school dismissals. No

affected included the 28, 38, 40, 43, 65, 73, 88, 89, 105, AB, and AS. No anticipated
cost impacts.
Belmar Call-n-Ride
The Belmar Call-n-Ride began operating in April 2013 with the opening of the West Line.
The Call-n-Ride operates Monday-Friday 5:30am – 8:00pm. The Call-n-Ride has not met
the RTD Service Standard of three boarding per hour. The Call-n-Ride currently has one all
day bus, 5:30am – 7:00pm and one peak bus, 6:00am-9:00am and 3:00pm – 6:00pm. It
is recommended to discontinue the peak bus. Anticipated savings are estimated to be
$82,038 in annual costs, which include fuel.
Golden Call-n-Ride
The Golden Call-n-Ride began operating in April 2013 with the opening of the West Line
under a Congestion Mitigation Air Quality Improvement Grant (CMAQ) sponsored by the
City of Golden, the Colorado School of Mines and the RTD. The Call-n-Ride operates one
vehicle as a Flex Route and two vehicles as a non-flex route Call-n-Ride on weekdays. The
Call-n-Ride operates Monday-Friday 5:30am – 8:00pm and Saturdays 8:00am – 11:00pm.
On Saturday, the Call-n-Ride operates one vehicle as a Call-n-Ride. The Saturday Call-nRide has not met the RTD Service Standard of three boarding per hour. The hours
between 7:00pm and 11:00pm carry less than one customer per hour. This
recommendation is to end the service day at 7:00pm. Anticipated savings are estimated to
be $11,152 in annual costs, which include fuel.

Route HX – 28th Street/Civic Center
With the opening of Boulder Junction at Depot Square Transit Center, it is proposed to
extend route HX into the new facility, from its current terminal at Pearl Street/29th Street.
No cost impacts are anticipated.

Highlands Ranch Call-n-Ride
The Highlands Ranch Call-n-Ride began operating in November 2006. The Call-n-Ride has
had difficulty in meeting the RTD standard of 3 boardings per hour. Douglas County, the
Highlands Ranch Metro District and the RTD agreed upon a cost share agreement for 2015
to keep the service. Additionally, a Transportation Advisory Committee was formed to
look at ideas to make the Call-n-Ride more productive. The Committee came up with
numerous ideas that will be implemented over the next few months. This recommendation
identifies the reduction of area served by the Call-n-Ride. The recommended area for
discontinuance is south of C-470, north of University and east of Colorado Blvd. The
current riders will be grandfathered into the service. No new riders will be accepted.
No cost impacts are anticipated with this proposal.
South Jeffco Call-n-Ride
The South Jeffco Call-n-Ride began operating in January 2012. The Call-n-Ride was
funded under a Job Access Reverse Commute grant. The Call-n-Ride operates MondayFriday 5:30am – 10:00pm and Saturdays 8:00am – 10:00pm. The weekday Call-n-Ride
operates with four peak vehicles. One vehicle operates a flex route to Lockheed Martin
operating two trips in the am and two in the pm. This flex route has not met the RTD
Service Standard of three boardings per hour. This recommendation is to discontinue the
Lockheed Martin Flex route and move the resources to the weekday Call-n-Ride service. In
turn, the Call-n-Ride will be allowed to serve Lockheed Martin by a Call-n-Ride trip that is
scheduled by the Lockheed Martin employees as a group. The South Jeffco Call-n-Ride
will have some modifications with schedule times at the station in order to make the Calln-Ride more reliable. With these additional resources, changes will be made to the
weekday service delivery model in order to make the weekday Call-n-Ride a more reliable
service to the customer. The Way To Go program will look at providing a vanpool as an
alternative for the Lockheed Martin customers. No anticipated cost impact.
Light Rail: E Line – Lincoln/Union Station
It is proposed to add one train in each direction in the AM and PM peak periods (7:24 AM
northbound from Lincoln Station, 7:14 AM southbound from Union Station, 5:09 PM northbound
from Lincoln Station, and 4:28 PM southbound from Union Station). This continues to assist
with increasing ridership demand to/from Union Station and W Line transfers as well as increased
school ridership in the fall. This proposal also advances the eventual goal of 15-minute E Line
frequencies in the entire AM and PM peak periods. Anticipated cost impacts are estimated to be
$189,000 annualized.
Light Rail: E Line and F Line
It is proposed to adjust late morning pull-ins and early afternoon pullouts to provide more efficient
service between Lincoln Station and downtown. This proposal has marginal impacts to
passengers; service levels would remain the same. Anticipated savings are estimated to be
$70,800 annualized.

Light Rail: H Line – Nine Mile/Downtown
It is proposed to discontinue the 2:18 AM southbound trip from downtown on late Friday and
Saturday nights. This trip was added in August 2014 as a “clean up” trip through downtown
after the other late night trains, but has resulted in comparatively lower ridership than its D Line
and E Line counterpart trips. Approximately 34 boardings would be affected that would need to
take a train approximately 10 minutes earlier. The northbound trip from 1:36 AM between Nine
Mile and I-25 & Broadway Station would be retained. Anticipated savings are estimated to be
$30,500 annualized.
School Service
Implement seasonal school service on the following routes:
Routes 1, 9, 11, 24, 30, 30Ltd, 31, 51, 52, 65, 73, 100, 206/206F and 208/208F.
(Route 43 school trippers replaced by improved regular Route 43 frequency)
Routes BOUND, DASH, JUMP, SKIP and STAMPEDE
Resume fall/winter schedule
Route N – Nederland/Boulder

SUMMARY OF PUBLIC MEETING
EastRidge Recreation Center
Wednesday, May 27, 2015
6:00 P.M.
Brian Matthews and Doug Monroe were in attendance. One person showed up. Alice is a member of
the HR Transportation Advisory Committee and wanted to show up for the support of changes. We
waited until 6:15pm and closed down the meeting.
It should be noted that this meeting was added to the proposed meetings after the brochure was
printed to discuss proposed boundary changes to the Call-n-Ride. A flyer was handed out on the Call-nRide and every customer that attended the previous Call-n-Ride public meeting and provided contact
information was notified via phone or e-mail about the proposed changes.

This meeting was conducted by Jessie Carter and Patrick Heye. No members of the RTD
Board of Directors were in attendance, nor were any other elected officials. Four (4)
members of the public signed the attendance sheet. The meeting was called to order at
6:05 P.M.
The purpose and format for the meeting was explained. Given the small audience, it was
determined to proceed directly to public testimony.
Regarding proposed service changes for August 2015:
 Commenter representing Lockheed Martin employees requested that the RTD
reconsider the cancellation of Southwest Jeffco Call-n-Ride service to the Lockheed
site. She stated that 300 more employees have been added to the location and that
additional marketing could be done to attract more riders. She was joined by two
others who participated in the meeting who also shared that an internship program
was starting near term, with students who would be dependent on the Call-n-Ride
service to the Lockheed site.
 Commenter representing employees of Denver Water expressed concern over the
proposed changes to Routes 8 and 33/34. She wanted to know how the schedules
would be coordinated with other bus services and light rail.
Without further comments, the meeting was concluded at 6:25pm.

Doug Monroe conducted the meeting. Additional staff in attendance included Steve
Hopkins and Diane Marquiss. Director Walker was also in attendance. One (1) member of
the public signed the attendance sheet. The meeting was called to order at 6:01 P.M.
Mr. Monroe thanked the attendee for her attendance. He introduced himself, staff
members, and Director Walker. Given the small audience, it was determined to proceed
directly to public testimony.
Regarding proposed service changes for August 2015:
 Commenter is a long-time transit rider and expressed dissatisfaction with the
discontinuance of Route 8 service to Denver Water during peak hours. Replacement
service for the route, Route 33, will not connect with her origination route
downtown (Route 10), requiring the use of a third route to connect. She
recommended Route 8 continue to serve Denver Water, perhaps with reduced

frequency. The commenter believed the proposed removal of parking at the Denver
Water campus would increase ridership on the route. (Staff shared the challenges
surrounding the Platte Valley industrial area, including Denver Water’s planned
removal of the Route 8 turnaround/layover location due to the imminent
reconstruction of its campus. Staff also explained it had met with Denver Water
representatives multiple times to discuss the proposed service adjustments –
including the same day as this meeting – and received support from the agency
regarding the proposal.)
Seeing no further comments, Mr. Monroe thanked the attendee for her time and invited
her to contact RTD if she had any further questions. Adjournment occurred at 6:11 P.M.,
with staff remaining until 6:25 P.M. to serve potential late-arriving commenters.

6:00 P.M.
Doug Monroe conducted the meeting. Additional staff in attendance included Steve
Hopkins and Diane Marquiss. Director Menten was also in attendance. Four (4) members
of the public signed the attendance sheet. The meeting was called to order at 6:02 P.M.
The format of the meeting was conversational in nature. Mr. Monroe thanked the audience
for its attendance and described the purpose of the evening’s meeting. He introduced
himself, staff members, and Director Menten.
Mr. Monroe asked if any attendees had any questions prior to providing public testimony.
One attendee questioned the rationale for the proposed changes to Routes 26 and 28.
Staff explained that the loss of a layover location on Wadsworth Boulevard and low
ridership on the Wadsworth segment of the routes led to the proposal. It was also
explained that daily service to Applewood would be maintained by Route 28 at similar
times to Route 26.
Seeing no further questions, the following public testimony was received:
Regarding proposed service changes for August 2015:


Commenter uses Route 26 to connect between 27th/Youngfield and
Lakewood/Wadsworth Station. She is “fed up” with RTD, stating that taxpayers are
not receiving the benefits from the taxes collected. The elimination of Route 100
service on Sundays adds to the challenge of using the bus in that area. She stated

Packet Pg. 60

Attachment: Attach B Public Meeting Notes August 2015 Service Changes (2389 : Board Report August 2015 Service Changes)

2.13.D.b

that the waste in the RTD administration could be put to better use on the street.
She believes that the proposal would result in significant walking distance
increases, making the bus an unviable option.
(Staff interjected to ensure the commenter’s comprehension of the proposal. It was
identified that she was of the belief that all service along 26th and 27th Avenues
would be discontinued. Staff assured her that this was not part of the proposed
service changes.)
Commenter continued that she was more understanding of the changes thanks to
the clarification provided by staff. She added that the connection times between
Routes 28 and Routes 76 and 100 needed to be better coordinated and that light
rail connection times were not necessary to consider. She likes the way Route 26
currently runs, allowing her to travel to and make connections at Lakewood
Commons/Belmar. There is too much redundant service to downtown Denver and
not enough service to other destinations.
(Director Menten interjected to confirm that Route 76 service along Wadsworth
would be maintained, and Mr. Monroe added that Sunday frequency would be
increased to every 30 minutes.)


Commenter has been a transit rider since the 1960s and just learned of the
proposed service changes to Route 26. He believes that the W-Line is working and
provides a good connection to downtown Denver and Golden. Route 26 is
innovative and should be kept. He described discontinued Route 125, which
previously provided service between Youngfield and the Federal Center via Colorado
Mills. He also described the convenience Route 17 used to provide. The lack of
connections between 38th/Youngfield and West Colfax Avenue is hard to
understand. He believes Route 26 is fabulous and is upset that RTD is going to
cancel it regardless of public comment. He stated that Routes 32, 38, and 44 all
travel between Youngfield and downtown Denver and questioned why a fourth
route would need to traverse the same route. He encouraged other riders to submit
their comments to RTD in email form or to attend public hearings. He also
suggested that Route 26 could layover on the southbound sidewalk on Wadsworth
Boulevard underneath the light rail station. He encouraged RTD to better publicize
the route and ask light rail customers which bus route they might use to reach the
station if their personal vehicle became unavailable.



Commenter believes that RTD should be more aggressive in acquiring increased
funding for its services. She occasionally rides Route 26 and notes that the bus
does not have many riders. Her primary concern is for increased service on Route
76 to help minimize transfer times and reduce overcrowding. She believes that the
segments of Routes 76 and 100 between Colfax and Interstate 70 are in need of
increased service, perhaps through the reduction of service on the northern and
southern segments of these routes. She feels that by averaging ridership figures for
the entire route, RTD does not see the actual picture of what ridership looks like
along the route. It was added that coordinating meet times at light rail stations is
unnecessary, but that coordinating transfer times between buses which run less
frequently is much more important. She added that the current timing of Routes 26

Packet Pg. 61

Attachment: Attach B Public Meeting Notes August 2015 Service Changes (2389 : Board Report August 2015 Service Changes)

2.13.D.b

and 28 mean that customers can’t transfer from one route to the other because
they run simultaneously. She mentioned that RTD has a tendency to overweigh the
authority of self-appointed neighborhood representatives who might not actually
represent the opinions of those in the neighborhood. She concluded her comments
reiterating her desire for increased service along Wadsworth on Sunday.
A general conversation followed regarding the costs of providing parking lots around the
district. Those in attendance who commented all deemed the cost to RTD as excessive
and that RTD should charge people who use these facilities. The location of certain parking
facilities was discussed, including that some neighborhoods who had spoken against
parking lots have received them anyway.
Seeing no further comments, Mr. Monroe thanked the attendees for their time and advised
them of the Board of Directors meeting on June 16, 2015. Adjournment occurred at 7:01
P.M., with staff remaining to answer further questions from the public.

Proposed August Service Changes - Route 120

Hello RTD staff,
I am writing on behalf of the City and County of Broomfield to support the proposed increase in service for the Route
120. The corridor between the Wagon Road Park n Ride and the Broomfield BRT Station has continued to develop and
serve additional riders. The 120th Avenue corridor also emerged from the North Area Mobility Study as a location that
has potential for arterial Bus Rapid Transit and we look forward to exploring that possibility with you some time in the
future.
We very much appreciate this service enhancement and will be happy work with RTD to promote it when it is
implemented.
Sincerely,
Debra A. Baskett

Dear Mr. Monroe,
You ask "Is there a particular building or complex at Evans/Depew in which elderly or disable passengers live? Or is it
just that general area? That information will certainly help us in making a decision."
It is the general area. For example, in my building the manager, Ray McKeachie, is a wheel chair bound Vet. Further
south is Nellie Pipzr at 2155 S. Depew. For Nellie to board the bus, the driver must lower the shoulder to assist
her. When I told Nellie Sunday morning as we were waiting for the 7:23am 21 East about the purposed changes, she
lamented "I'm so tired already when I come home, I don't want to walk another block to get home."
Neither she or the other gentleman waiting for the 21 had heard of the purposed changes, nor did either of them use
the internet. (I knew only because of an email.)
You also said "Route 21 currently averages about 2 passenger boardings per trip between Sheridan and Federal. We
expect that the bus running on Jewell will attract more riders and also improve service for passengers riding through
that section."
I would argue that while you may be attracting more riders from North of Jewell, but you will be doing a disservice to
the riders along Evans between Sheridan & Federal. I would also say that from my riding the 21 both east & west 5‐7
days a week, I see 4 or more riders picked up along Evans EVERY day of the week, depending on the time of day. If data
collecting by the drivers is practiced as often as the drivers on the 21 route announce connections, your rider data is
under reported 50% OF THE TIME.

I ask you please DO NOT GO FORWARD with this change to the 21 route. As this change will degrade
service for as many if not more riders then will be gained from the change.

Sincerely, Don Lewis

15/15L Suggestions

I have noted that you plan to change the route 15/15L bus route to exclude the Anschutz Medical Campus, and I
am protesting this modification.
The UCDenver Anschutz Medical Campus hosts some of the most cutting-edge medical research in the world
and is rapidly growing. Many employees and students rely on public transportation to access the campus. Thus,
removing the campus from the route would create an unnecessary burden on individuals wishing to come to the
Anschutz Medical Campus, and would likely result in decreased use of the bus route altogether.
Furthermore, it would require employees and students to walk further from a stop to reach the campus in a
neighborhood that is not altogether safe for walking extended distances, especially when employees and
students are walking by themselves. This is an issue of usage as well as safety. Please maintain the Anschutz
Medical Campus as part of the current route.

Proposed Service Change to Route 15

Regarding RTD's proposed service change to "discontinue the route 15 deviation via Aurora Court into the Anschutz
Medical Campus," I highly discourage such a decision. I have been a long‐time (well over 10 years) rider on Route
15/15L because I work at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. Every trip, I see seniors and families ride
the 15 bus who get off at one of the stops along Aurora Court in order to keep their medical appointments at University
Hospital and clinics or Children's Hospital. Eliminating the Route 15 stops along Aurora Court makes a much longer walk
for seniors/families to see their doctors. When an individual doesn't feel well or has a mobility limitation, the extra walk
from East Colfax onto the Anschutz Medical Campus can be grueling and even dangerous to their health and safety,
particularly in inclement weather.
University of Colorado students and employees also ride the 15 bus and then walk to and from their respective buildings
on campus. Eliminating the Route 15 stops along Aurora Court means adding 10‐15 minutes walk time for students and
employees, often making it even more difficult to arrive at class or work on time or to catch connecting buses and light
rail at the end of the day.
While the 20 bus also stops along Aurora Court, it does not connect with West Colfax buses along the remainder of its
route and the 20 bus does not run as often as the 15 bus. One of the perks of the 15 bus over the 15L is that the 15 runs
often and stops every 2‐3 blocks, while the 15L runs just as often and makes far fewer stops. Both 15 and 15L are
crowded. My experience has been that real travel time on the 15 and 15L are very close to being the same, so why
eliminate the convenience of Route 15 bus stops along Aurora Court? Please reconsider the service change to Route 15
to keep the bus running along Aurora Court.
