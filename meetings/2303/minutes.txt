June Board Meeting Agenda Review
Chair Sisk requested Interim General Manager Genova to review the agenda for the Board
meeting. It was noted that with the exception of the 2015 amended budget, all items had
passed committee unanimously.
Motion:

Discussion:

Director Walker made the motion to move the June Board
agenda forward for the June 16 Board meeting.
Director Hoy seconded the motion.
Chair Sisk noted under the GM Executive Search Committee
that the listening sessions have been going fine and quite
enjoyable. Director Hoy commented that his session at Platte
was outstanding. He believes we should find a way to

incorporate these types of forums with the employees
periodically throughout the year. Chair Sisk commented that a
common theme has been silos and communications. The
employees expressed appreciation for the Board members to
offer these listening opportunities. Interim General Manager
Genova added that he has heard similar messages as well in
the employee strategical survey and that staff is addressing
this issue.
Paula Perdue shared there is an issue that is surfacing that is
more for the GM Executive Search Committee but she wanted
to communicate to the Executive Committee so they can be
clear on the process. The process followed by the GM
Executive Search on inquiries or people wanting to apply is
that all this will be channeled through the Executive Search
Firm who will do the screening, etc. This is to maintain
fairness and equity in treatment across the board and that no
one person is perceived to have an unfair access to Board
members or advantage. All of the input from the listening
sessions, focus groups, CAC meeting, and the input from the
Board will be funneled into a candidate profile that will be used
by the Executive Search firm. Right now she is holding all
inquiries or communications in the Board office until the
Executive Search firm is hired, targeted around July 7th. Board
members should continue to refer interested parties to her
until the Executive Search firm is hired. This process allows
the Board members to have clean hands and ensure everyone
is treated equitably.
Director Hoy commented it is important that we set the
expectations for day pass printers on day 1. Interim General
Manager Genova noted they are having these discussions.
Interim General Manager Genova indicated he will have several
items to share under the General Manager Report. One such
item is the Clinton Global Initiative which Marla Lien, General
Counsel, participated in this week.
Director Walker noted he will be doing an update on the APTA
Board seminar under old business.

Vote on the
Motion:

The motion passed.
Chair Sisk Declared the motion PASSED.

A.

Approval of 2015 Amended Budget

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors adopt Resolution No. ___, Series of 2015 to amend and appropriate funds for the
proposed 2015 Amended Budget, to increase the appropriation by $134.670 million to
$1,520.186 million as detailed below in the overview of the 2015 Amended Budget, and
to decrease the appropriation of Capital Carryforward (previously approved capital funds)
by $315.917 million to $987.198 million.
This action item meets policy requirements and the General Manager’s goals of Fiscal
Sustainability/Financial Plan by effecting current budgeting in a timely manner.

Unanimous Consent
B.
Authorization to Enter Into Contract with INIT for Purchase of Day Pass
Printers
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the
Board of Directors authorize the Interim General Manager or his designee to enter
into a $2,700,000 sole source contract with INIT Innovations in Transportation,
Inc. (INIT) for purchase, integration and installation of equipment and software
necessary to accommodate the sale of day-pass fare media under the newly
adopted fare structure (Contract Number 15DH072). This contract will include
integration with the Computer Aided Dispatch/ Automatic Vehicle Location
(CAD/AVL) system, interface changes for the new fare structure, parking pass
validation and a 3-year extended warranty.
C.

Approval of Contract for External Audit Services

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the
Board of Directors authorizes the General Manager to execute all documents
necessary to award a contract to RubinBrown, LLP to perform RTD’s annual
external audit services. The contract is awarded for audit services for calendar
years 2015, 2016 and 2017 in the amount of $333,500. There is an option to
extend the contract for two additional one year periods, at RTD’s discretion, in the
amount of $239,500.
D.

August 2015 Service Changes

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the
Board of Directors approve the August 2015 Service Change package as revised
and summarized in Attachment A resulting in an annualized cost of approximately
$279,000 and, further, to authorize the General Manager or his designee to
execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is
impacted by these changes.

Recommended Action

Other Matters



Director Walker shared he will be meeting with the Urban Peak organization which
is located in his district to talk about fares. He considers this a listening session.
Interim General Manager Genova shared three things:
o The MAX group will be meeting during the same time as the APTA Board
Seminar. They will be having events including inviting Chair Sisk to do a
welcome on July 20 which is a conflict with the APTA session.

Meeting with Affordable-income taskforce—The staff has met with the
leader for Mile High Connects who appears to have a different perception of
the commitments made by RTD. Staff will continue to work on gaining
clarity and understanding of how we can partner together with this
taskforce. Director Hoy conveyed his position that while RTD is willing to
work with these organizations to provide options for the transit-dependent
poor, RTD does not have a coffer to finance these subsidies. Chair Sisk
added this is a complicated issue and that while our objective is to work
with these organizations, he sees it more as issues affecting how to improve
the distribution channels of our low-income fare program. We need to
separate out the structure issues from this next phase dealing with this.
Director Walker commented his concern is in using percentages as that gap
could widen over time. He referred to the King County model that does not
use percentages.
o Interim General Manager Genova shared that RTD will have lots of visibility
at the APTA Rail Conference. A number of staff members will be presenters
and RTD will receive the APTA Gold Award for safety. The two Board
members in attendance (Anderson and Bagley) will be asked to accept these
awards along with staff on behalf of the agency. He will be there but will
leave early to attend the CDOT event on Monday.
Chair Sisk referenced the CDOT opening and stated that he and Paula have been in
discussion about protocols when an event is in a respective district. In this case,
this is not a RTD hosted event but a CDOT event and he was contacted directly by
CDOT as the Chair of the Board. Nevertheless, we need to be clear on our
protocols for including Board members on events occurring in their respective
districts. This will be most important for the 2016 opening. Paula Perdue added
that while some of the events may not be hosted by RTD, this is an opportunity for
our PI department to help communicate to these other organizations that we do
have protocols and to suggest we should include the Directors representing these
respective districts.
Director Walker shared that former General Manager Washington had invited him to
be a member of the APTA Nominating Committee and he will be attending a
meeting around August 21 or 22.
