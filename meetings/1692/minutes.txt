I.

Recommended Actions
• Approval of August 2010 Service Changes – Bruce Abel, Assistant General
Manager, Bus Operations, brought this action forward to the Committee. This
package of Service Changes includes improvements to service, adjustments to
service and service cuts. Eleven public hearings were held regarding the service
changes and based on the feedback, staff made some adjustments.
Director McMullen wanted to know how much cutting the Route 65 saves the
District. Jessie Carter responded it is about $210,000 per year.
Director Busck wanted to know about the changes to the Route R/RX.
Carter said that turning one existing trip in the a.m. to an express trip.

Director Bagley wanted to know details on the change in service on the Route 0
on the South end. Mr. Carter said one trip is being removed at 11:21 p.m. into
Highlands Ranch (daily) and then service on Saturday and Sundays is going to
one hour frequencies instead of half hour.
Director Tayer thanked staff for responding to the public’s input. He made a
request that at service change meetings we have a recording device so that the
one staff member doesn’t have to take notes and respond to the public at the
same time. He was concerned about information getting lost.
Director Malpiede thanked staff for their response and asked that we make sure
an interpreter is provided for meetings where there may be monolingual Spanish
speakers.
Director Brohl was pleased with the alternatives offered and the precision with
which the changes were made.
Committee Chair Brohl was concerned about the change to the Route 31 and
wanted to make sure this change doesn’t affect people negatively. Mr. Abel
said that staff will monitor the use of the route and that the changes were made
based on the riders.
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that the
Board of Directors approve the August 22, 2010 Service Change package as
revised and summarized on Attachment A resulting in a net annualized cost
savings of approximately $1,168,000, and, further, to authorize the General
Manager to execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators
whose service is impacted by these changes.

Director McMullen made a motion to
forward this item to the full board at the
June 22, 2010 Board Meeting.

SECOND:

Director Tobiassen seconded the motion.

VOTE ON
MOTION:

The motion passed unanimously.

II. Other Matters – Director McMullen brought up the issue of paying $50,000 for
fixing the gates at County Line Station. Where is the money going to come
from? Rick Clarke responded that the money would come from the surplus
TREX budget. Director McMullen expressed his dislike for the gates at this
station and would like to see them removed. He feels these gates have cost the
district too much money.
