Chair Hoy said that one of the best parts of the evening is when the Board recognizes retires.  He noted that there were no retirees for the month of July, but stated that there was an APTA International Rail Rodeo winner that would be recognized.

Terry Emmons, Assistant General Manager of Rail Operations, thanked the Board for the opportunity to recognize RTD’s APTA International Rail Rodeo winners.  He said that it was an extremely tight race as always, and while RTD did not get the top award, the participants did extremely well.  He added that the operators were in an unfamiliar vehicle, so they had to learn how to use it before the rodeo.  He noted that the four members from RTD, both the operator team and maintenance team, attended.  He remarked that George Sweeney from the maintenance team, was in attendance that evening, and they did an amazing job, finishing in 8th place.

Phil Eberl, General Superintendent, said that Mr. Sweeney had been to the APTA International Rodeo thirteen times, winning first place and overall in Miami, and winning overall in Vancouver.  He commented that getting to the rodeo is an accomplishment in of itself and he was very proud of Mr. Sweeney.

Mr. Emmons commented that next year RTD will have the home field advantage, and staff is looking forward to hosting the APTA International Rail Rodeo next year.

General Manager Genova thanked the Board for the Employee Appreciation Event.  He said that, as employees spread out to other divisions, they do not get an opportunity to see their friends and this event allowed them to do that.

General Manager Genova remarked that RTD is still operating under a waiver from the FRA, which expires on Sunday, July 30, 2017.  He said that on Monday, staff submitted a petition to have the B Line removed from the waiver since the B Line has one private crossing that is not under the purview of the FRA.  He noted that seemed to be a reasonable approach, and staff expects to hear back from the FRA by the end of the week.  He explained that the University of Colorado A Line waiver is currently being developed by staff, and if the FRA approves the changes made to the technical document, DTP believes that they will be in compliance with federal requirements.  He added that there is also the CPUC order, and they have asked that the at-grade attendants remain in place until RTD gets through the final CPUC process.  He noted that currently, there is a lot of momentum, and staff is eager to hear with the FRA has to say.

General Manager Genova remarked that the $1.00 hourly wage increase for rail and bus operators had been implemented and will go into effect on July 30, 2017, and the increase would show up on their August paychecks.

General Manager Genova added that Lacy Bell, Corridor Planning Manager, had been accepted as RTD’s nominee for Leadership APTA and said that she would represent RTD well.

Director Folska said that it was encouraging to hear that RTD is making great strides with the University of Colorado A Line and B Line.  She noted that the people she meets are excited for the G Line and asked what the plan was for when things do not go right.

General Manager Genova said that things will go well.  He remarked that staff needs to get through this week first to see what the FRA’s response will be.  He commented that, if staff needs to do something else based on the FRA’s recommendations, they will work on that.

Director Deadwyler asked about the quiet zones along the University of Colorado A Line, and inquired when they would be implemented.  She said that constituents in her district are miserable and asked if the horn decibels could be lowered.

General Manager Genova remarked that the goal is to get the University of Colorado A Line certified for quiet zones.  He stated that, once RTD is certified through the FRA and CPUC, the quiet zones can be implemented.  He noted that the decibel level is a regulatory requirement, and the horns are in the 90 decibel range.  He remarked that other methods could possibly be used, such as wayside horns, which do not have as big of an impact.

Chair Hoy stated that he lives five miles from the B Line and he can hear the train from his house.

Director Lubow discussed the Mobility Choice Board meeting and reminded the General Manager that the RTD Board had asked for copies of the minutes from that meeting.  She added that she would also like to see the legal documents regarding Mobility Choice’s policies and priorities.

Director Francone noted that she had asked staff for a list of the participants on the Mobility Choice Board and she had not received it yet.  She then inquired about the University of Colorado A Line waivers and how they affected the G Line.

General Manager Genova said that staff has regular conversations with the CPUC to advance the G Line testing.  He noted that RTD had received limited testing permissions from the FRA and CPUC and all of those tests had been completed.  He stated that the only remaining testing that requires approval is for the crossings and the wireless crossings.  He commented that once the FRA approves the criteria document on the timing, RTD will request permission to complete the remaining testing for the G Line.  He noted that the CPUC wants to address the University of Colorado A Line amendments first then work on the G Line, whereas staff would like them to be done in parallel.

Director Francone remarked that Director Anderson gave a stunning presentation at a meeting with the City of Arvada and everyone was interested to hear about what was going on in their community.  She said that the presentation, along with comments from the General Manager, will reassure the public that RTD is not sitting back and doing nothing.

Director Williams asked if the Mobility Choice Board meetings were open to the public.

General Manager Genova said yes and added that the Mobility Choice Board is still working through the draft bylaws that will memorialize open meetings.

Director Williams asked that the RTD Board be notified beforehand so that they could attend.

Rolf Asphaug, General Counsel, remarked that the Memorandum of Understanding says that they will operate in the spirit of the Colorado Open Meetings Law.

Director Folska commented that Arvada cannot wait for their commuter rail service to begin.

## XI. Unanimous Consent

Chair Hoy suggested that if there were any questions or need for discussion of an agenda item, a Director should request it be removed from the unanimous consent agenda.

Director Folska asked that the Contract with INIT for Automatic Passenger Counters for Light Rail Vehicles be moved to Recommended Actions.

Director Menten said that she would like the Approval of General Manager's 2018 Goals moved to Recommended Actions.

Chair Hoy, seeing no other comments, asked for a motion to approve items A through C.

Motion:               Director Deadwyler made the motion to approve items A-C on the unanimous consent agenda.

Director Tisdale seconded the motion.

Vote on

The Motion:              The motion passed with 13 in favor (Anderson, Archuleta, Broom, Deadwyler, Folska, Francone, Hoy, Lubow, Menten, Sisk, Solano, Tisdale, Williams) and 0 against.  Directors Mihalik and Walker were absent.

Chair Hoy declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

### A. Construction Award for IFB 37-DH 001. Customer Care Call Center and Treasury Repair Facility.

It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to award a contract to AD Miller Services in the amount not-to-exceed of $5,627,730 for the New Customer Care Call Center and Treasury Repair Facility project. Funding for this contract is included in the 2017 Amended Budget. It is further recommended that the General Manager or his designee be authorized to issue contract amendments in the total amount not-to-exceed the remaining approved project budget of $845,393 as needed.

### B. Enter into a Contract with RouteMatch for MDT and On-Board Software for Access-a-Ride

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to award a contract for computerized Mobile Data Terminals (MDTs) and onboard software with RouteMatch Software, Inc. (RouteMatch) (Contract Number 17DH025) for an amount not to exceed $1,800,000.  The price includes MDTs, software, implementation and three years of extended support.

BACKGROUND

RTD’s Access-a-Ride paratransit service provides transportation in the Denver metro area for people whose disabilities prevent them from using lift-equipped fixed-route bus service. Access-a-Ride service uses vehicles equipped with RouteMatch software and iPilot 8000 computerized Mobile Data Terminals (MDTs) and associated onboard equipment that enables dispatching and communications via the RouteMatch paratransit scheduling and central dispatch software (‘RouteMatch central software’). The current MDTs entered service in 2009 and reached end of useful life several years ago. The current MDT’s have very high failure rates and are hard to procure. Consequently, it is imperative that the MDTs be replaced with modern equipment in order to provide Access-a-Ride drivers with the necessary tools to provide this important service.

DISCUSSION

RTD currently utilizes paratransit scheduling software produced by “RouteMatch.” It is necessary that the on-board software loaded on the MDT’s integrate with the backend RouteMatch software in order to allow Access-a-ride drivers to receive accurate information to perform their duties.  Onboard software that integrates with the RouteMatch central software is already developed.

RTD conducted an evaluation of the various options to replace the existing Access-a-Ride Mobile Data Terminals. The option with the quickest deployment, least risk and lowest cost is to have RouteMatch deploy new modern versions of the computerized MDTs with onboard software. Requiring RouteMatch to provide the updated hardware and software, perform the integration and thus provide the complete solution to modernize the Access-a-Ride MDT’s will speed the process by providing fewer procurements and result in a single point of contact for RTD to have one vendor responsible for all of the functionality associated with the upgrade of the Access-a-Ride MDT’s.

FINANCIAL IMPACT

Funding for this project is included in the adopted RTD budget.

ALTERNATIVES

1.  Authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute a contract with RouteMatch to provide computerized MDTs and onboard software.  This is the recommended alternative.

2.  Continue to try to provide remedial repairs to extend the system life.  This is not a sustainable option and does not provide the upgrades necessary for Access-a-Ride drivers to perform their duties. This is not recommended.

3.  Proceed with an entirely new procurement for a new paratransit scheduling software package and integrated MDT’s.  This would take well over a year to procure and deploy the chosen system and is not budgeted. This is not recommended.

### C. 2017-004 : Resolution to Approve Refinancing for Interest Savings

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Resolution”), authorizing the execution and delivery by the RTD of a lease purchase agreement and related documents in connection with the partial refinancing of the 2010A and 2015A Certificates of Participation.

##### a. 2017 Resolution - 004 Refunding of 2010 and 2015 COPs

### D. Enter into a Contract with INIT for Automatic Passenger Counters for Light Rail Vehicles

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to award a contract for purchase, installation and maintenance of Automatic Passenger Counters (APCs) with INIT Innovations in Transportation, Inc. (INIT) (Contract Number 17DH026) for an amount not to exceed $2,400,000 and transfer up to $950,000 from project 10444 (Mobile Data Terminals) to project 10345 (New Automatic Passenger Counter).

BACKGROUND

RTD uses APC’s on light rail vehicles to monitor on-time performance and to gather ridership information. The data collected by the APCs is ingested into the INIT Computer Aided Dispatch/ Automatic Vehicle Location (CAD/AVL) system for compilation, presentation, and analysis of ridership numbers and on-time performance calculations. This data is key for required federal reporting, operational considerations and planning.  Currently, only 42 of the 201 vehicle LRV fleet (24%) are equipped with APC’s making it very difficult to provide statistically valid information.

DISCUSSION

RTD recently purchased hardware for the Access-a-Ride Mobile Data Terminal (MDT) Replacement project.  Staff subsequently determined that the equipment could be better utilized on the LRV fleet to expand the number of APC equipped light rail cars to help with passenger count and on-time performance measurement. A less expensive alternative for the Access-a-Ride MDT Replacement Project has been identified and pursued, freeing up some funds that can be transferred to purchase additional APCs for light rail.

RTD currently has an authorized and budgeted project (Project 10345 -New Auto Passenger Counters) to begin to upgrade and expand the number of APC’s on the LRV fleet.  Utilizing some of the hardware that had already been purchased for the Access-a-Ride MDT project and transferring the remaining funds from the MDT project will allow RTD to expand the scope of the currently budgeted LRV APC project and further increase the number of Light Rail Vehicles that can be equipped with new APC equipment. By using some of this equipment and transferring these additional funds, the APC coverage on the LRV fleet can be increased to over 70%.  This will allow for easier and more timely compilation of statistically valid data for monitoring on-time performance and for gathering ridership data for internal and external reporting. This equipment will be upgraded for both reliability and for security of data transmissions over Wi-Fi.  This will be a sole source contract to INIT in order to expand the number of APC equipped light rail vehicles with technology similar to and compatible with the technology that is utilized on the existing LRV fleet.

FINANCIAL IMPACT

Funding for this project (Project 10345- New Automatic Passenger Counters) is included in the adopted RTD budget. The transfer of up to $950,000 from project 10444- Mobile Data Terminals, also included in the adopted RTD budget, to project 10345 will fund the requested expansion of this effort.

ALTERNATIVES

1.  Authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to award a contract for purchase, installation and maintenance of Automatic Passenger Counters (APCs) with INIT Innovations in Transportation, Inc. (INIT) (Contract Number 17DH026) for an amount not to exceed $2,400,000 and transfer up to $950,000 from project 10444 (Mobile Data Terminals) to project 10345 (New Automatic Passenger Counter).  This is the recommended alternative.

2.  Continue to try to utilize existing resources and provide minimal expansion and upgrade to the existing APC’s. This does not leverage the existing hardware purchase and minimizes improvements in data collection and service monitoring and is not the recommended alternative.

Motion:               Director Anderson made the motion to approve the Contract with INIT for Automatic Passenger Counters for Light Rail Vehicles.               Director Deadwyler seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Director Folska said that to her this passenger counter seems like redundant technology and asked why RTD needed this service.

Bruce Abel, Acting Chief Operations Officer/Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, said that the answer lies in the fact that in terms of rail the fare purchase process is separate and apart from the boarding process.  He said that the purpose of the Automatic Passenger Counters (APCs) is to be able to count the number of boardings assigned to the various routes.  He added that the APCs will allow staff to better understand what services people are using.

Director Folska commented that she would be a no vote for this item.  She said that there is other technology available that would generate income instead of spending it.

Mr. Abel added that in addition, the APCs will also monitor the on-time performance of rail.

Vote on

The Motion:              The motion passed with 12 in favor (Anderson, Archuleta, Broom, Deadwyler, Francone, Hoy, Lubow, Menten, Sisk, Solano, Tisdale, Williams) and 1 opposed (Folska).  Directors Mihalik and Walker were absent.

Chair Hoy declared the motion PASSED.

### E. Approval of General Manager's 2018 Goals

It is recommended by the General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee that the Board of Directors approves the General Manager’s goals for 2018 as defined in the attached General Manager’s Performance Evaluation document.

Motion:               Director Deadwyler made the motion to approve the General Manager’s 2018 Goals.

Director Williams seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Director Menten said that in the past, as a member of the committee, she tried to set a higher level for exceeds expectations.  She stated that in reality, nothing has changed in this proposal from previous years and at the end of the day, this is gauged to decide how much of a performance bonus the General Manager will be awarded.  She stated that since this evaluation is tied to a monetary gift, the expectations should be set to a higher bar, so she would be a no vote for this item.

Director Francone stated that she was disappointed to hear that Director Menten’s concerns were not addressed beforehand.  She added that the entire Board was welcome to attend the General Manager Performance and Oversight Committee, and if a Director wanted to speak with her, her phone was always on.  She added that she was disappointed to know that Director Menten was not pleased with the recommendation.

Director Menten stated that in the past she did not see enough change in the committee and added that she did not know what else could have been done.

Vote on

The Motion:              The motion passed with 12 in favor (Anderson, Archuleta, Broom, Deadwyler, Folska, Francone, Hoy, Lubow, Sisk, Solano, Tisdale, Williams) and 1 opposed (Menten).  Directors Mihalik and Walker were absent.

Chair Hoy declared the motion PASSED.

##### a. 07.19.17 GM Memo to Committee Revision 1 accepted

##### b. 07.19.17 GM Memo to Committee Revision 1 (002)

## XIII. Executive Session

There was no Executive Session.

## XIV. Old Business

Director Folska asked for someone to explain to her how much money in reimbursements the District receives from Medicaid.

General Manager Genova stated that there were zero reimbursements.

Mr. Abel added that, while there were no reimbursements, Medicaid has purchased fare media from RTD for their clientele.

General Manager Genova said that staff would have to research those figures.

Director Folska asked that those numbers be sent to the Board.

Director Anderson remarked that Arvada has a vibrant Olde Town that is full of business and has been a Transit Oriented Development (TOD) even before RTD had transit.  She stated that it is a great community and it has one of the lowest crime rates in the metro area.

## XV. New Business

Director Menten asked when the Board would receive a list of all of RTD’s property holdings as she wanted to know everything that RTD had.

General Manager Genova said that the surplus properties list would include all properties with no transit plan.  He then inquired if Director Menten wanted a list of all RTD owned properties, not just surplus.

Director Menten said yes.  She added that she wanted to know about everything and said that the Board could go through the list to determine what properties could be sold.

General Manager Genova said that staff would research the available format of the information and will inform the Board as to what kind of effort would be required to compile a list.

Chair Hoy said that the list Director Menten is requesting actually exists because there is a list of over 500 properties.

Director Francone commented that the Board received an update from the General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee with the core and task goals for 2017.  She said that the information would help the Directors complete their surveys and added that answers such as “Not Applicable”, or “I don’t know” were not appropriate responses.

Chair Hoy commented that the next three Tuesdays were busy for the Board.  He said that the Annual Program Evaluation (APE) workshop would be on August 1st and the APE will be problematic this year.  He added that it would be beneficial for everyone if they could attend.  He added that the SANS Cyber Security training would be on August 8th and he asked everyone to please plan on attending.  He further noted that there would be a community engagement event on August 15th and encouraged the Board to attend that as well.
