B. Recommended Actions

• August 2017 Service Changes
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that
the Board of Directors approve the August 2017 Service Change package as
revised and summarized in Attachment A resulting in an annualized cost
savings of approximately $19,700 and, further, to authorize the General
Manager or his designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for
private operators whose service is impacted by these changes.
Motion:

Director Tisdale made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the June 27, 2017
Board Meeting.
Director Broom seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Bruce Abel, acting Chief Operating Officer/Assistant General
Manager of Bus Operations, reminded the Board that last
month his team presented their draft recommendations for the
August 2017 service changes. He explained that RTD hosted
several meetings around the Denver Metro Area for public
comment and stated that staff made revisions based off of
public feedback. He said the proposal to alter the D Line was
turned down and stated that public comment suggested that
RTD needed to conduct more public outreach to explain the
pros and the cons of the changes. Mr. Abel asked Jessie
Carter to go into more detail regarding the meetings and
changes.

Mr. Carter further explained that route 206 will not be
eliminated, but the frequency from buses running every half an
hour will be reduced to every hour. He explained that
modifications were made to the Route 0 and Route 0L to
maintain a bus stop at Center Avenue and make an additional
bus stop at Exposition.
Director Menten asked if the cost for the additional bus for the
Golden Call-n-Ride will be covered 100%.
Mr. Abel stated that the City of Golden would fund that
service.
Director Menten inquired if the constituents asked for any
changes to the Golden Call-n-Ride.
Brian Matthews, Manager of Special Services, said that the
only request was to increase the frequency of the service.
Director Lubow stated that there were some piteous letters
written to the Editor regarding the 209 and Golden West. She
asked for information on how many people use that bus.
Mr. Carter stated that there are approximately 4 boardings a
day southbound and 7 boardings a day northbound. He said
that if those figures are measured against the 23 trips offered
southbound and the 13 trips offered northbound, it is a very
small number of people per trip. He further stressed that it
would not meet RTD’s deviation standards to provide services
there.
Director Lubow said in total for both directions, there were
only 11 boardings per day.
Mr. Carter confirmed her numbers and said that the level of
ridership had not increased even after marketing efforts were
Packet Pg. 6

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 20, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Jessie Carter, Manager of Service Planning and Scheduling,
noted that there was a good turnout at the public meetings.
He stated that as a result of the meetings, RTD will defer the L
line proposal to have a more robust conversation with the
community and stakeholders. He added that this will give staff
an opportunity to look at the alternatives that were provided
by both constituents and stakeholders.

put into place. He stated that at some point RTD needs to cut
the losses from that route and direct efforts elsewhere.
Director Lubow stated there were a lot of comments regarding
the Route 0 and 0L and wanted to know if they were resolved.

Director Tisdale congratulated staff and complimented Mr.
Carter on his terrific people skills and ability to engage with
constituents.
Director Folska informed Committee Vice Chair Williams that
her computer was not working and therefore she would
verbally state her vote.

• Call-n-Ride Amendment for New Contract
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that
the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to
amend the recently awarded ADA paratransit services contracts with MV
Transportation and Via Mobility Services (per solicitation #16-DH-047) to
include the provision of Call-n-Ride services. The amendment to the MV
Transportation contract is for three years for $13,110,752, with two oneyear options, option year 1 is for $4,587,223 and option year 2 is for
$4,797,357. Fuel is considered a pass through. Fuel is estimated at
$1,206,599 for the first three years and with option year 1 at $426,569
and option year 2 at $439,367. The total not to exceed cost for the 5-year
period for MV Call-n-Ride services and fuel is $24,567,867.
The
amendment to the Via Mobility Services contract is also for three years for
$12,700,984, with two one-year options, option year 1 is for $2,642,063
and option year 2 is for $2,753,714. Fuel is considered a pass through.
Fuel is estimated at $671,325 for the first three years with option year 1 at
$237,334 and option year 2 at $244,454. The total not to exceed amount
for the 5-year period for Via Call-n-Ride services and fuel is $13,854,096.

Motion:

Director Tisdale made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the June 27, 2017
Board Meeting.

Discussion:

Mr. Abel said that when submitting Requests for Proposals,
RTD will first award ADA Paratransit services and then select
Call-n-Ride service providers. He said that this allows RTD to
leverage management teams in the facilities of the ADA
Paratransit Services and it results in lower costs to RTD.
He said that in April, the RTD Board awarded the ADA
Paratransit services contracts to MV Transpiration, Via
Mobility, and Transdev but only MV and Via Mobility were
selected as the Call-n-Ride service providers as reflected in this
action item.
Director Broom asked if the cost of diesel fuel increased by a
dollar a gallon, how would the contract be handled and further
inquired if RTD would have to complete a change order. He
then asked how much of a difference in cost would require the
Board’s second review/approval.
Mr. Abel stated that the proposal is at $2.50 a gallon, and
with gas fluctuating from $2.32 to 2.42 a gallon, he does not
anticipate a budget amendment. He stated that normally if
there is a miscalculation, that particular division would come
through the amended budget process and request additional
funds.
Director Folska asked if RTD locks in fuel prices.
Mr. Abel said that RTD locks in rates for diesel but not
gasoline because RTD does not use enough.
Director Folska asked how much RTD would have to spend on
gasoline to lock in a price.
General Manager Genova said it was tied into whatever the
contract amount would be. He stated that he would research
the item and report his findings to the Board.

Scheduling and Run-Cutting Software Application (16DO018)
It is recommended by the Operations & Customer Service Committee that
the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to
execute all documents necessary to award a contract for the new Fixed
Route Scheduling and Runcutting Software Application to M.A.I.O.R. Sri
(M.A.I.O.R), in an amount not to exceed $4,000,000.00. The price includes
the period of performance base of four years and six one-year options (total
ten years).
Motion:

Director Archuleta made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the June 27, 2017
Board Meeting.
Director Tisdale seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Mr. Abel mentioned that the Service, Planning, and Scheduling
group had been using the Trapeze Fixed Route program for
over 17 years and there have been a number of changes in
technology and RTD’s services have changed as well. Mr.
Abel asked Eric Dunham, Senior Project Manager of IT and
Jessie Carter to present this item to the Board.
Mr. Carter said that the Trapeze program is used to create
RTD’s public schedules, however, it is out of date and
cumbersome to use. He said that his team is wasting a lot of
time using the program and staff needs a program with a
friendlier user interface that is more time efficient. He
stressed that $4 million is a lot of money, but the return on
investment will net RTD significant savings.
Mr. Abel stated that the new software assists with creating
public schedules and run cutting is used to create schedules in
which the Bus Operators bid on.
Mr. Dunham stated that IT’s role was to help Mr. Carter
upgrade Service Planning’s system by reviewing the proposals

from an IT standpoint and IT interviewed six companies. He
said that through the selection process, M.A.I.O.R. met all of
the 532 requirements. He stated that currently, M.A.I.O.R.
works with large transit systems in Rome and Milan and they
offered the best architecture to meet RTD’s needs. He added
that the data center is located in the United States to ensure
minimal risks and he advised Mr. Carter’s team to move
forward with the contract with M.A.I.O.R. from an IT
perspective.

Mr. Dunham responded that M.A.I.O.R. is headquartered in
Florence, Italy. He stated that during the bid process staff
was informed that on June 1, 2017, M.A.I.O.R. was bought
by Clever Devices, that operates in Woodbury, New York.
Director Menten asked for clarification on Mr. Dunham’s
comment regarding minimal risks to RTD’s system.
Mr. Dunham stated that there are standard practices and
firewalls, and with the Data Center being in the United States,
RTD has better access to the architecture and security. He
added that it was a requirement RTD put in the Statement of
Work.
Chair Hoy stated that he had heard that Trapeze was a
difficult system and agreed that this is a great change. He
asked how the transition is going to take place and who would
train staff how to use it.
Mr. Dunham stated through the selection process, M.A.I.O.R.
visited RTD to demonstrate an example. He stated that their
program appeared to be very easy to use and intuitive, and
said that the transition will be easy.
Mr. Carter said that the M.A.I.O.R. program is a Windows
based environment and the Trapeze system was D.O.S. based
and not as user friendly.
Mr. Abel said that Bus Operations will budget money to send
staff to user conferences to learn more about the program.
Director Sisk stated that his only concern is whether or not
M.A.I.O.R. has done any business with transit systems in the

United States, and if they have, which cities are using their
services.
Mr. Carter stated that Kitsap Transit in Bremerton, Washington
is currently using M.A.I.O.R. Mr. Carter added that
internationally, M.A.I.O.R. is working with more complex
systems than RTD.

Mr. Carter responded that they are very responsive to do what
RTD needs and they are set up to work with RTD’s rail
system, which Trapeze is unable to do.
Director Folska asked if there was a plan in place in case the
M.A.I.O.R. program does not work for RTD.
Mr. Dunham stated that it is IT’s practice not to transition an
old program until the new program is running efficiently. He
stated that RTD will not decommission the Trapeze system
until the new system is up and running. He stated that as the
project manager of this process, it will be his responsibility to
meet all IT requirements.
Director Folska indicated that her concern is that the new
software may not work and RTD will be stuck with the
program. She said she does not want to go down that path
again with a program that cannot produce what RTD needs.
Mr. Abel noted that he does not want to down play the
transition process, and indicated that his team is serious about
making it work.

C. Updates

• Lost Service Hours Update
Mr. Abel, reported that for May 2017 there were 185 lost service hours. He
said that it is a significant improvement from last year and it is due in part to
the mandate that employees must work one of their days off. He explained
that Bus Operations is 132 drivers short so his team is working diligently
with Human Resources to bring more people in. He noted that most of the
employees that are leaving RTD are first year employees.
Director Folska suggested a heavy push in advertising on mainstream
television, radio, and all other media outlets to assist with recruiting efforts.
Director Walker said that recruiting drivers and mechanics is a nationwide
problem due to a strong economy.

• Contracted Fixed-Route Quarterly Report – 1st Quarter 2017
Mr. Abel stated that on-time performance is still a challenge, but he was
pleased to note that it has continued to improve since 2015. He said that
staff is still working on improving on-time performance and focusing on
problematic routes in order to provide better service for RTD’s customers.

Director Walker said that the Executive Committee for Denver’s General
Obligation (GO) Bond forwarded their recommendations and there are some
transit projects that will be beneficial to RTD.
Mr. Abel stated that Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager of Planning,
and his team have been working closely with the City and County of Denver
to put together the GO Bond recommendations. He added that he was very
pleased that the city had been listening to RTD and supporting transit.

• Access-a-Ride/Cab 1st Quarter Update 2017
Mr. Abel stated that the Access-a-Ride and Access-a-Cab reports reflect that
rides have increased slightly compared to last year. He stated that revenue
hours were slightly below budgeted revenue hours and reminded the Board
that in the first quarter, RTD was experiencing a shortage of Access-a-Ride
drivers. He noted that the new operator wage rates went into effect on
March 1, 2017, and since then staff has seen improvements on droppedservices. He stated that the on-time performance goal is 95% and it has
improved from 94.5% in the first quarter of 2016 to 94.6% in the first
quarter of 2017.
Director Menten highlighted that the Access-a-Ride numbers have decreased
by 19%, which she felt was substantial. She stated that she was under the
impression that RTD was going to start veering towards Access-a-Cab and
asked for clarification.
Mr. Abel commented that for this quarter RTD saw a decline in service and
his team was not steering people into that direction, however, there was an
attempt to incentivize people to use Access-a-Cab.
Mr. Buter added that cab drivers will only go for the big tipping destinations
and they do not want to go out of their way for an Access-a-Ride trip. He
remarked that outlying trips are not being completed and there are a lot of
driver no shows.
Director Menten asked for confirmation that there was an increase in
Access-a-Ride service, and a decrease in Access-a-Cab service.

Mr. Buter stated that customers are shifting back to Access-a-Ride.
Director Folska stated that customers use Uber instead of using Access-acab, it will save RTD from spending subsidy costs.

• Special Services Report 1st Quarter 2017

• 2017 1st Quarter Drug & Alcohol Compliance Monitoring
Mr. Abel indicated that the Drug & Alcohol Compliance Monitoring report
was included in the packet for review.

• 2017 1st Quarter Customer Complaint Analysis
Mr. Abel explained that the number of complaints have decreased.
Carolyn Conover, Senior Manager of Contracted Services, stated that the
number of complaints have decreased because there has been an
improvement in on-time performance and operator customer service.

• 1st Quarter 2017 Security Statistics & Fare Inspection Summary
Michael Meader, Chief Safety Officer/Assistant General Manager of Safety,
Security and Asset Management, stated that he would answer any questions
the Board may have regarding the security statistics and fare inspection
summary.
Director Tisdale asked why fare evasion numbers increase when plain
clothed officers issue tickets.
Mr. Meader explained that plain clothed officers do not have a visual
deterrent of a uniform to cue fare evaders to exit a bus or train, and that is
why plain clothed officers are able to catch more instances of fare evasion
than uniformed officers.

D. Other Matters
Director Broom asked if there would be any additional maintenance projects
scheduled for the remainder of the summer.
General Manager Genova said the biggest project was replacing track at Speer and
Stout the weekend of June 9th -12th. He noted that there would not be any
additional projects scheduled for the summer.

GM Oversight & Performance Management Committee Background/Overview



Committee Background
Committee Chair Francone stated that the General Manager Oversight and
Performance Management Committee (the committee) is one of the most
important functions the Directors perform. She said that Heather McKillop,
Chief Financial Officer and Assistant General Manager of Finance and
Administration, and Barbara McManus, Executive Manager of the Board

Ms. McManus touched on the background for the General Manager’s review
process. She stated that no formal process existed prior to 2009, the year in
which a state audit found exceptions with the compensation practices of
RTD’s General Manager at that time. She said RTD created a process to
allow for a thorough review of the General Manager’s performance, and a
committee was chartered to address the exceptions noted in the audit. She
noted that the committee has used the same materials and process for
several years and stated that the committee would once again have two
specific goals: Reviewing the General Manager’s performance during the
2017 calendar year and establishing the review criteria to be used in 2018.
She said that a goal-setting timeline was included in the committee’s
materials. She noted the committee had previously met as many as 15 times
in a year and had met 12 times in 2016, but she expressed that the newly
revised process could potentially result in fewer meetings. She said the
committee would be able to review the process and establish additional
meeting dates moving forward. She explained the spreadsheet that would be
used to evaluate the General Manager’s performance. She noted that one of
the benefits of a visual representation of the performance evaluation would
be to graphically demonstrate the committee’s expectations and what is
required for the General Manager to meet or exceed those expectations.
Lastly she listed the broad categories in which the General Manager would
be reviewed, some of which are the same elements used in evaluating other
salaried employees.
General Manager Genova added that the “Safety” component of the
evaluation had been added to the core competencies of all salaried
employees.
The committee discussed the elements contained on the 2017 review chart
for the General Manager’s performance evaluation.
Committee Chair Francone asked if Ms. McKillop’s role was to determine
whether the General Manager had hit his performance goals.
Ms. McManus responded that Ms. McKillop had volunteered to compile
responses from the Senior Leadership Team as to whether each department
has met its targets and completed projects.
General Manager Genova reiterated that Ms. McKillop was merely compiling
status reports from Departments based on assignments he had given. He
said the Assistant General Managers report on departmental progress. He

Office, have analyzed the General Manager’s performance evaluation and
goal-setting process and devised a spreadsheet to graphically depict that
process.

6.B

said his report to the committee would be a determination of what has been
accomplished by each department.

Chair Hoy offered an explanation of the reasoning behind the review
process. He said the Board created the committee because it was necessary
to do so. He said the process has gone moderately well, though he noted
that Directors in the past have attempted to evaluate the General Manager
on criteria that had not been agreed upon in the previous cycle. He said that
the committee members would eventually become more familiar with the
visual evaluation methodology.
Director Williams said that she felt the visual representation would give the
General Manager something to work toward.
Director Broom asked which agency performed the audit on compensation
practices and whether the audit covered performance or financial matters.
Director Anderson said the Office of the State Auditor (OSA) conducted the
audit because they were upset over the compensation of a previous General
Manager.
General Manager Genova noted that OSA did not set up the performance
evaluation process, rather the Board created the process based on the audit
recommendations. He said that RTD receives questions from other agencies
interested in using the process.
Committee Chair Francone stated that previously RTD did not have a robust
evaluation process. She said the audit suggested a formalized evaluation
based on certain criteria.
Director Broom asked whether an audit is performed every year.
General Manager Genova said that OSA performs an audit on a particular
area of RTD’s operations every few years, such as bus and rail operator
safety in 2016.
Director Anderson commented that the state legislature had been unhappy
with the Board of Directors and how they managed a prior General Manager.
She said the legislature called for an audit and demanded the Board do a

Packet Pg. 18

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2017 3:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Ms. McManus stated that the committee is responsible for updating the
performance spreadsheet so that everyone, including the General Manager,
knows where the committee stands on the individual elements in the General
Manager’s evaluation.

6.B

Director Sisk said the history of the performance review is important but
wanted to recognize that the committee’s evaluation was previously based
on consensus. He said that previously one Director would be reticent to
accept the appraisal decided upon by the other five members. He said that
going forward it may make sense to allow for top and bottom evaluation
scores given by Directors to be disregarded. He said that General Manager
Genova was not granted performance-based incentive in 2016 and that
there was some consternation regarding the decision. He said the newly
revised evaluation system has been several years in the making.
Director Broom asked whether General Manager Genova was under an
employment contract, and the General Manager confirmed that that he was.



Approved Policies
Ms. McManus said that she was compiling a binder of all approved policies
and background materials the committee would need and said that the
General Manager’s contract would be part of that binder. She said that she
would send any new material to the committee members before each
meeting.

III.

Proposed 2016-2017 GM Goal Setting and Evaluation Timeline
Director Williams asked whether the committee would meet monthly.
Committee Chair Francone said that the schedule would be driven by the General
Manager’s ability to participate.
Ms. McManus said that the committee usually meets twice each month initially and
then takes a break.
Committee Chair Francone said that the performance evaluation and the
establishment of goals for 2018 are two separate components. She said the goalsetting aspect should be complete by the end of July 2017.
Director Broom asked whether the entire Board ratifies the 2018 goals.
Committee Chair Francone said the committee makes recommendations and those
recommendations are voted upon by the Board.
Director Anderson said it that the part to remember is that the committee is
establishing 2018 goals.

Packet Pg. 19

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2017 3:30 PM (Committee Reports)

better job of evaluating their employee so that it would be documented for
the public as to why a person was receiving a performance-based incentive.

6.B

Chair Hoy said, in order to minimize confusion, it is important to emphasize the
difference between the two functions undertaken by the committee, namely the
2017 performance review and the 2018 goal-setting process. He said the
committee would be determining whether the process would remain the same for
2018 and said the goals were established prior to 2017.
Ms. McManus stated that prior committees had encountered challenges in years
past about decisions that were already made. She said the committee last year had
revisited decisions that had already been made earlier in the year, which made the
process cumbersome. She said the hope going forward is to have a clearer roadmap
of the process.
Director Williams asked whether the committee’s process for 2017 would be the
template for the 2018 process.
Committee Chair Francone said that would be a possibility.
Chair Hoy said the process is only a template and may change for 2018, though he
said the process seemed workable. He stated the committee would decide at the
end of 2017 whether the revised process worked.
IV.

Review Performance Evaluation Process & Mapping
General Manager Genova pointed out that the five core goals encompassed in his
performance evaluation came from his job description and that the several task
goals came out of the annual retreat. He said the committee spends most of its
time analyzing the task goals.
Director Williams summarized that the General Manager would present how he
would accomplish the task goals and then report to the committee on how those
goals were accomplished.
General Manager Genova noted that the Board approves both the task goals and
the rating on his performance evaluation.
Committee Chair Francone said the system sounds confusing but reiterated that
Ms. McManus would put together a notebook that would provide guidelines and
history. She said the performance review chart would help show where the
committee is in the process. She said that the committee would be using the

Packet Pg. 20

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2017 3:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Ms. McManus discussed the materials included in the committee packet. She noted
that a survey would go out to all of the Directors within the following two weeks
and noted that the survey form was included in the packet. She said that, once the
results are compiled, both the committee and the rest of Board members review the
results so that the committee can get a sense of how the Board feels. She noted
that the committee meetings are open to all Directors.

6.B

revised process for the first year in 2017 and that the process would hopefully help
prevent the committee from moving backward at the end of the year and to direct
and prioritize the committee’s work

Ms. McManus said that the review chart would be printed in large format, updated,
and placed in the room for review for each meeting. She said she would suggest
that all the committee members review the materials contained in the committee
packet including the survey that would be sent out. She said she would also
forward the 2017 tactical goals document that the General Manager presented to
the Board in 2016 from which the review chart was built. She said her thinking
was that the committee should jump in feet first to begin their work and suggested
that the next two meetings could be held on July 11th and July 18th.
General Manager Genova asked which meeting the committee anticipated he would
present information.
Chair Hoy asked what would be on the agenda for the first meeting.
Ms. McManus said that the General Manager would be presenting his first round of
accomplishments in 2017 prior to the survey being sent out.
General Manager Genova commented that staff has already compiled a lot of
information.
Director Anderson asked whether a memo on the subject could be sent out instead
of scheduling a meeting.
Ms. McManus said that staff can arrange whatever the committee chooses.
Committee Chair Francone asked for clarification on the timing of the committee’s
tasks. She said the timeline showed that the committee should be discussing the
2018 goals but that the proposed meeting would cover the General Manager’s
2017 accomplishments.
Ms. McManus clarified that the committee works on both tasks in tandem. She said
the committee would fully review the General Manager’s 2017 accomplishments
once the 2018 goals are established.

Packet Pg. 21

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2017 3:30 PM (Committee Reports)

General Manager Genova said that Ms. McKillop and Ms. McManus have worked
hard on putting together the review chart. He said he likes that the format keeps
pertinent information in front of people but mentioned he had not scrutinized every
line of the chart. He said he was sure that Ms. McKillop and Ms. McManus have
pulled the right information from the previous review documents.

6.B

Chair Hoy said that the committee has its goals and that the General Manager
needs to establish his task goals.
Ms. McManus clarified that General Manager Genova’s task goals are established in
the tactical plan and that the General Manager would establish how he has met
those goals.

General Manager Genova asked whether he would be providing both the 2018
goals and his mid-year accomplishments at the same time
Ms. McManus said that staff could continue to compile the goals and stated that
Ms. McKillop was collecting information from senior leadership.
General Manager Genova said that he could draft the 2018 goals memo by July
11th.
Committee Chair Francone asked whether the committee could postpone the next
meeting until July 18th.
Director Sisk said that would be possible.
Ms. McManus said that one of the tasks of the committee General Manager Genova
submits his memo would be to determine how to move forward.
Committee Chair Francone proposed that the committee members do their
homework and have dialogue outside of the meeting so that everyone is prepared
by July 18th.
Director Anderson said that the committee would have everything finalized by July
18th so that the goals would be able to be presented to the full Board by July 25th.
She said that, any questions or comments after July 11th could be submitted to Ms.
McManus.
Ms. McManus said that all questions should be routed to the same place so that
nothing is a surprise.
Chair Hoy said the committee should make sure that the email chain among
Directors does not become open meeting. He said that he realizes the committee
has a fluid timeline but stated it would be nice to have long-term schedule.
Ms. McManus said that she could put together a schedule based on past years and
add those dates to the calendar.
Packet Pg. 22

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2017 3:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Williams asked whether General Manager would be able to draft a memo
by July 11th.

6.B

Chair Hoy agreed and stated that the dates may be subject to change.
Ms. McManus said that the committee could also meet on July 20th and still have
time to add submit a recommendation to the full Board if the committee does not
reach consensus on July 18th.
Director Sisk suggested the committee could start at 3:00 p.m. on July 18th.

Chair Hoy said that everyone should realize the committee schedule is fluid but that
the committee has deadlines to meet. He said not everyone will be able to attend
every meeting.
Committee Chair Francone noted that a Finance Workshop was scheduled for July
18th.
Ms. McManus said that she would have to check her calendar to coordinate
possible committee dates. She said that Ms. McKillop could probably move the
Finance Workshop. She summarized that General Manager Genova would provide
his 2018 goals memo by July 11th, which she would forward to the committee for
review, and that the committee would need to determine which specific elements
to add to or subtract from the General Manager’s goals. She said the committee
would meet at 3:00 p.m. on July 18th to fill in the blanks on the 2018 performance
goals document.
V.

Bi-Annual Board of Directors Survey
Committee Chair Francone asked when the survey would be sent out.
Ms. McManus replied it would be sent out within two weeks.
Chair Hoy asked whether everyone on the committee had been surveyed.
Ms. McManus stated the new members of the committee had not.
Chair Hoy said that the members would be asked to give input on what they have
seen from the General Manager.
Ms. McManus stated that a copy of the survey was included in the committee
packet.
Director Walker asked whether General Manager Genova would need to send out
his list of 2017 accomplishments before the survey goes out.

Packet Pg. 23

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2017 3:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Ms. McManus asked whether everyone was in agreement, and none of the
committee members expressed opposition.

6.B

Ms. McManus stated that the list does not need to be submitted specifically to the
committee because it goes out to the full Board. She said that document gives the
Directors a reference to the General Manager’s assessment of his own performance
so that everyone knows what he is being evaluated against.

Ms. McManus said she would check with the IT staff. She said survey participants
had not been identified in the past
Director Broom suggested the Directors could be polled to ask whether they have
completed the survey.
Director Sisk recalled that Committee Chair Francone had to extend the dates of the
survey because three or four Directors did not respond. He said the Directors have
an obligation to complete the survey.
Committee Chair Francone said that filling out the survey is one of the most
important things the Directors do.
Director Williams asked whether the survey is only completed by the 15 Directors,
and Committee Chair Francone said yes.
Director Williams asked who compiles the surveys.
Ms. McManus said that IT pulls together the reports.
Director Williams asked if there were any way to include participants’ names on the
survey.
Chair Hoy said that she could put her name in the survey comments.
Director Williams asked whether there was any reason for her not to include her
name.
Committee Chair Francone said there has been reluctance in the past to include
names.
Chair Hoy said that some Directors may want to blast the General Manager and
would prefer not to be identified. He said the reason the names are not included is
that it would be obvious who responded with an unsigned survey if everyone else
submitted a signed form.
Packet Pg. 24

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2017 3:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Anderson asked whether there is a way to tell who has submitted the
survey and who has not. She said it makes no difference who submitted it but that
it is important for everyone to participate.

6.B

Committee Chair Francone said that she would not write anything in the survey she
would not say to the General Manager personally.
Director Broom said the Directors must assume that the press would see a copy of
the survey and that they may not want to be quoted.

Director Sisk said the committee should recommend the inclusion of names as an
optional identifier.
Chair Hoy suggested that the name field should simply just be added to the form.
Director Anderson and Williams informally moved to add the name field.
Director Walker reminded the committee members to keep in mind that the survey
should only encompass the General Manager’s 2017 performance.
VI.

Questions and Next Steps
Committee Chair Francone asked the committee whether there were any other
questions and whether everyone was clear on the committee’s direction, and no
one had questions.

B. Recommended Actions

• Construction Award for IFB 37-DH 001. Customer Care Call Center and
Treasury Repair Facility.
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee
that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to
award a contract to AD Miller Services in the amount not-to-exceed of
$5,627,730 for the New Customer Care Call Center and Treasury Repair
Facility project. Funding for this contract is included in the 2017 Amended
Budget. It is further recommended that the General Manager or his designee
be authorized to issue contract amendments in the total amount not-toexceed the remaining approved project budget of $845,393 as needed.
Motion:

Director Tisdale made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the July 15, 2017
Board Meeting.
Director Archuleta seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager of Planning,
introduced Robin McIntosh and Richard Rost to discuss this
item with the Board.
Robin McIntosh, Senior Manager of Facilities, stated that he
was acting in two roles: as a fill in for Henry Stopplecamp and
as the Senior Manager of Facilities. He explained that RTD
needs to regroup, and staff is asking for the funds to build the
new Call Center and Treasury because the current space is
limited and employees are busting at the seams.
Director Francone asked if the total construction amount was
$6,473,699 as there were two separate amounts listed.

Packet Pg. 27

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jul 11, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Directors Folska, Menten, and Sisk participated via phone.

6.C

Richard Rost, Facilities Engineering Manager, stated that the
contract award amount was $5,627,730 and the $845,393
balance of the project budget would be used for contingency,
furniture, and anything else that might require additional
funds.

Mr. McIntosh remarked that staff calls it the 711 building
because it is at 711 W. 31st Avenue and it is located near 31st
and Fox, near the intersection of 31st Avenue and Park Avenue
West.
Committee Chair Lubow commented that in the Board Report
three contenders were listed and the only information
indicated for each vendor was their bid price. She further
asked why AD Miller Services was chosen as that information
was not included.
Mr. Rost stated that the action item was based on an
Invitation for Bid (IFB), not a Request for Proposal (RFP). He
added that no pre-qualifications were needed, so staff sought
the lowest cost.
General Manager Genova stated that there are two types of
procurement methods: IFB or RFP. He said that RFP’s are
mainly for design/build and professional services to get the
best value. He noted that IFB’s are for construction only, and
no other professional services are attached.
Committee Chair Lubow remarked that this is a large sum of
money and it is being decided by the difference of a few
thousand dollars, which seems unusual.
Mr. Van Meter explained that having three bids in close range
demonstrated that the design was well specified.
Director Deadwyler asked if any of the firms considered were
Disadvantaged Business Enterprises (DBE).
Mr. Rost noted that RTD’s DBE goal was 12% and AD Miller
Services proposed 25%.
Director Broom asked if staff knows that a contractor usually
performs subpar, would they still accept a bid from that
vendor if they are the lowest.
Packet Pg. 28

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jul 11, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Solano asked where this facility was located.

6.C

Mr. Rost stated that RTD had not used AD Miller Services
before, but there is a process in place to review their work
afterwards to determine if they will be used again in the future
for other projects.

Director Folska inquired if the location of this facility was in
the way of the proposed I-70 expansion.
General Manager Genova stated that it was not in the direct
area of the expansion and it would not be impacted.
Director Folska inquired as to what would happen if the
contractor did not perform to RTD’s specifications.
Mr. Rost stated that it would be no different from any other
RTD contract. He added that staff must allow the contractor
to perform, and then document everything if they did not. He
further added that there would be provisions in the contract if
they did not.
Director Folska remarked that she is concerned about
awarding a contract to any vendor unless there is a plan B,
and a contingency plan in place.
Mr. Rost noted that this contract would have a performance
bond in place.
Director Sisk commented that he agrees with Director
Francone’s concerns about the amount of funds for
contingency and that it appears to be outside of the norm.
Mr. Rost stated that the current estimate for furniture is
$350,000, but staff must also be prepared to deal with any
unforeseen issues or problems. He added that staff does not
anticipate spending all of the funds, but if there are funds
available, the General Manager will have the authority to
spend it.
Director Deadwyler commented that the explanation Mr. Rost
provided made her uncomfortable. She added that because of

Mr. McIntosh commented that RTD makes sure that vendors
meet certain criteria, and if they do not, staff will not award

6.C

the cost of the building, the extra $845,393 needs to come
before the Board before it is spent.
Committee Chair Lubow asked if Director Deadwyler wanted
to amend the motion.

Motion to
Amend:

Director Deadwyler made the motion to divide the question on
the Construction Award for IFB 37-DH 001 Customer Care
Call Center and Treasury Repair Facility by separating the
contract amount from the contingency amount.
Director Solano seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Rolf Asphaug, General Counsel, stated that the motion made
by Director Deadwyler is to separate the contract award
amount of $5,627,730 from the contingency amount of
$850,393 leaving the contract award without any contingency
or change order capability. He added that the second vote
would include the funds for contingency, furnishings, and
change orders.
General Manger Genova commented that any time RTD
awards a contract it is for the contract value, which does not
include contingency funds. He added that the total contract
budget for this project is $6,473,699, which was based off of
staff’s internal cost estimate. He further noted that, while the
contract amount is $5,627,730, the positive aspect of having
the additional $845,393 is that RTD would have the flexibility
to amend the contract without stalling the project.
Committee Chair Lubow asked Director Deadwyler if she
wanted to stay with her motion to amend.
Director Deadwyler commented yes, and no.
Director Deadwyler stated that she did not like the way the
item was presented, and having the total project budget come
before the Board in pieces has caused confusion, not just to
her.
Director Walker remarked that he would vote no on the
division of the question because contractors should not have
to wait a month before the Board votes on a decision. He
Packet Pg. 30

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jul 11, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Deadwyler said yes.

6.C

noted that the contingency built into the project budget is for
change orders, unexpected environmental or structure issues,
and other amounts needed to cover items outside of the
project scope. He added that, based on his experience in
construction for the past 11 years, staff presented this the
best way possible.

Mr. Asphaug added that the motion is to separate the two
funds. He added that his concern is that if the vote to award
the contract amount passes, but the vote for the contingency
fund fails, there will be a stalled project.
Director Mihalik stated that it may be beneficial if staff could
elaborate on other factors that need to be considered.
Mr. Rost remarked that the building is an existing facility that
was built in the 1940’s. He noted that while surveys have
been completed on the site, staff will not know about all of
the potential issues until the work begins.
Chair Hoy explained that this is a $6.4 million project and staff
received a bid for $5.6 million. He noted that staff will have a
budget allotment of $6.4 million and there are a lot of items
that the contractor is not providing. He agreed with Director
Walker and said that the Board cannot stall work. He asked
staff to provide final project totals once all of the work is
completed so that the Board would have a better
understanding of the total project costs. He added that he
would not vote for the motion to divide the question.
Director Tisdale stated that he would vote no on the division,
and yes on the original motion. He added that the language of
the motion is confusing and could have been presented better.
Director Williams thanked staff for the work they have done
on this item and added that she was not in favor of separating
the amounts, so she would not vote in favor of the division.
Director Francone explained that the Board has a better
understanding of the contingency amount and the distribution
and added that the Board struggled with the language of this

Director Anderson agreed with Director Walker and stated that

considering its age, who knows what staff will find when the
work begins.

6.C

item. She added that if the language had been clearer, it
would have helped.
Director Deadwyler remarked that she understood the item
better, and she would be voting against her own motion, or
would withdraw it. She asked staff to do a better job of
ensuring that the Board understands where all of the funds will
be spent in the future.

Committee Chair Lubow asked the Directors for verbal
confirmation that they agreed to withdraw the motion by
Director Deadwyler. She noted that every Director was in
agreement, so the motion was withdrawn.
Director Menten noted that RTD had property which was
acquired with the University of Colorado A line near 40th and
Smith Road. She asked if that property would eventually be
sold.
General Manager Genova stated that is a likely possibility, but
he would research the status of that property and report back
to the Board.
Director Archuleta called the question.
Committee Chair Lubow stated that the Board was voting on
the original motion. She asked Directors Folska, Menten, and
Sisk for their votes, and all voted in favor of the item.

C. Updates

• Pass Program Study
Mr. Van Meter said that at this point in time the Pass Program Study might
seem a bit muddy, but through the process there will be clarity. He noted

Michael Washington, Transit Equity Manager, stated that the Pass Program
working group had met three times so far. He added that staff had launched
a web page to be transparent with RTD’s constituents in an effort to help
them understand the process and what was involved in the study. He noted
that meeting agendas and minutes would be posted, including any
presentations offered during the working group meetings. He commented
that Four Nines Technologies (FNT) was selected as the technical consultant
to assist staff with revenue modeling and ridership figures from the options
considered by the working group in order to help them determine a final
recommendation for the Board’s consideration. He noted that FNT was
made up of the same group that lead RTD’s fare study in 2014-2015.
Mr. Washington said that the working group meetings have been included on
the two-week calendar and public comment is allowed at the beginning of
each meeting. He remarked that the meetings are being convened
throughout the district at a different location each time. He commented that
the first meeting occurred downtown at the Denver Metro Chamber’s office,
the second meeting was at the Boulder County Commissioners office, and
the third meeting was at the Shorter Community AME Church in the Park Hill
neighborhood of Denver. He stated that the first meeting introduced the
working group members to one another and to the task at hand.
Mr. Washington noted that at the first meeting the group discussed:
 Desired outcomes such as equity, increase transit mode share,
sustainability, simplifying access to programs, straightforward and
transparent price calculations, SBP targets, and the appeal to all
demographics.
 Shared values such as using transit to advance economic needs,
protecting the environment, improve mobility, and optimizing land
use
Mr. Washington stated that the second meeting was the first in which
several members of the public attended. He added that the General Manager
was also there and reaffirmed the need for a fiscally sustainable
recommendation. He noted that public comments at that meeting centered
on the value of the various pass programs, and questioned how to continue
the pass program success in the future.
Mr. Washington remarked that staff presented the current state of the
pass program portfolio and:
 Summarized revenue, pass distribution and administration by the
pass program
 Introduced tap date for Eco, NECO, and College passes
Packet Pg. 33

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jul 11, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

that staff is making great progress and Michael Washington would be joining
him for this presentation.

6.C

He further noted that Boulder County presented the approach that
Boulder government, businesses, and neighborhoods have taken to
access, administration, and promotion of pass programs.

Director Francone asked if she could get a list of the working group
members offline. She added that the Colorado School of Mines has been
asking for the college pass program data and asked staff to provide that to
them. Lastly, she inquired as to when meetings had been scheduled in
Highlands Ranch, Golden, Evergreen, and Conifer.
Mr. Washington stated that meetings are still being planned, but staff
anticipates having meetings in those locations.
Director Deadwyler asked how much had been budgeted for this study.
Mr. Washington commented that the study was budgeted at $205,000.
Director Menten thanked staff for publishing the agendas, minutes, and
presentations for the pass program working group meetings.
Director Sisk expressed his appreciation of staff for their outreach efforts.
Committee Chair Lubow stated that the business model of Eco-Passes
seems to be inequitable, and with high school students not being able to get
an equivalent, that inequity needs to be addressed.
Mr. Washington stated that is one of the reasons that the pass program
working group is examining the different models. He remarked that one item
this group will create are white papers to discuss the differences between
the various programs.
Director Anderson commented that at one time staff had presented the
Board with a chart outlining the cost estimates of the Eco-Pass and the true
cost of the program. She asked staff to provide that chart again as a
refresher.
General Manager Genova remarked that the day before, Mayor Hancock of
Denver gave his State of the City address. He noted that Mayor Hancock
stated that the city would be providing free passes to 1,500 students. He
explained that the City and County of Denver purchased 1500 smart cards
Packet Pg. 34

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jul 11, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Mr. Washington commented that at the third meeting, the group focused on
the future and considered concepts and options that they would like to
explore. He noted that the next meeting would occur on July 25th at the
Adams County Western Service Center at 1:00 p.m. and reminded the Board
that the final report would not be available until the first quarter of 2018.

6.C

with a stored value to provide to the students and had paid the regular price
for the smart cards. He wanted to make sure it was clear to other
jurisdictions and mayors that these cards were paid for.

D. Other Matters
Director Francone stated that she has heard rave reviews for the smart cards and
everyone she has talked to has loved it and is excited about the program.

Mr. Van Meter said that the three agencies, Colorado Department of Transportation
(CDOT), Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) and RTD are drafting a
memorandum of understanding. He stated that CDOT, through their procurement
process is working to create the scope of work. He added that his staff along with
the General Manager had reviewed some material earlier in the day, and they are all
taking the Board’s direction seriously. He noted that questions regarding the
memorandum of understanding should be directed towards General Counsel.
General Manager Genova noted that some of the items included in the
memorandum of understanding included having the meetings open to the public,
creating a mobility choice website, and having meeting dates, agendas, and
minutes available online.
Director Folska commented that Mr. Van Meter only mentioned three entities, and
she thought there was four.
Mr. Van Meter explained that the funds from the public sector entities are managed
separately from the Denver Metro Chamber’s funds.
Director Williams said that she ran into someone today who received their letter to
participate in RTD’s new Advisory Committee for People with Disabilities (ACPD)
and they were very excited.
Committee Chair Lubow stated that she wanted to discuss the RTD Board’s
commitment to finishing FasTracks. She noted that she had been trying to get rail
for her district for the past four and half years and her constituents want to see
tangible progress. She noted that merely saying RTD is committed does not move
things along very much so she complied a list of proactive measures that the Board
could do, which were include in a resolution that she read aloud.
Committee Chair Lubow asked the Board to commit to:
1. Depositing FasTracks moneys coming into or generated by RTD over and
above Operations and Maintenance expenses and funds needed to cover
operational shortfalls, into the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA);
and
Packet Pg. 35

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jul 11, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Francone then asked for an update on Mobility Choice.

6.C

2. Promoting the use of revenues generated or to be generated out of state or
regional ballot initiatives or referenda initiated by other entities for
transportation or related purposes, into appropriate FasTracks projects; and

4. When excess cash flow is generated or forecasted to be generated due to an
excess of RTD revenue, from whatever source, over expenditures, promote
the investigation and possible use of that money for bonding purposes to
finish the FasTracks corridors in an expeditious manner; and
5. Urging RTD staff to investigate the creation of "bus bridges" or other nonpermanent, alternative transportation services to the proposed corridors, as
temporary compensation for commuters in unfinished FasTrack corridor
areas; and
6. Confirming that completing the FasTracks corridors is a priority for RTD,
create and annually fund in appropriate amounts, a FasTracks escrow
account with monies intended to be saved and used for the purpose of
completing FasTracks corridors
7. Requiring RTD staff to annually report to the Board pro-active steps taken
pursuant to this Resolution to support expeditious completion of the
FasTracks corridors.
Committee Chair Lubow said that this would show RTD is serious and is taking the
steps needed to complete FasTracks. She added that Director Tisdale had already
provided her with constructive feedback, and Director Folska suggested that 2% of
the operating budget be saved annually. She explained that the purpose of the
resolution at this time is to open it up for discussion and to get a sense on how to
move forward. She noted that this was not going to be voted on this evening, but
was being presented for discussion.
Director Anderson commented that she understands the desire to finish FasTracks.
She noted that it was a law voted upon by the people of the district and RTD is
obligated to the citizens of the region to use those tax payer funds in the way that
the citizens wanted. She added that Directors take an oath of office to ensure they
take care of the responsibilities to their constituents. She stated that Committee
Chair Lubow is sincere with her concerns, but at the same time, RTD has a robust
budget process that goes out six years. She said that is resolution implies that
RTD’s budgeting system is not any good, and this will fix all of the problems, which
isn’t true. She further added that this is not a good way to do public policy. She
explained that there is a law which requires RTD to take care of all of the FasTracks
corridors and this resolution, while well intended, would undermine any future

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jul 11, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

3. Urging RTD staff to research cost-saving ideas for unfinished FasTracks
corridor construction and operation and creative funding mechanisms for the
same; and

6.C

Board’s ability to make decisions based on need within the region. She said that
she would not be in favor of any resolution like this.

Director Broom stated that he did not see the proposed resolution until today and
suggested that is be put on the next meeting’s agenda. He added that the Board
should not tie its hands, and by stating a firm amount, the Board could be tying its
hands and deferring maintenance in order to comply with the resolution.
Director Folska agreed with Director Tisdale and said that the public needs to hear
that the Board is committed to finishing FasTracks. She inquired as to the status of
sales tax revenue that RTD receives from the sale of marijuana.
Mr. Asphaug said that he nothing to report at this time. He noted that staff is
continuing to meet to determine what options are available and that if any Director
wanted to discuss this item further, he would be happy to set up a call with them.
Director Sisk noted that while statutory requirements are in place, it would be nice
to have a statement from the Board reaffirming their commitment to FasTracks. He
said that this is not just a Boulder County or Longmont issue, it is about finishing all
of FasTracks.
Committee Chair Lubow thanked everyone for their comments. She said that one
of the items of most importance to her was the escrow account. She noted that it
was worthy of discussion, and she does not presume that this Board would bind
future Boards, but she sees this as an annual discussion. She said that it is very
important to discuss a fiscally sustainable annual contribution of a decent amount
each year. She noted that item six seems to have the biggest contention, but the
Board is discussing a commitment to people in regions that do not have their rail.
Chair Hoy said that item six was important to him, but for a different reason. He
said that it is a direct conflict with FISA and RTD would run into problems if staff
needed to access that money and were not able to. He noted that the Board hears
comments that they need to make a commitment to the public, and he said that
however RTD needs to do it, it needs to be done. He commented that he would
change the entire resolution to say that the Board is committed to finishing
FasTracks. He further noted that the Annual Program Evaluation (APE) would be
Packet Pg. 37

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jul 11, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Tisdale said that he had an opportunity to review the resolution in advance
and said at some point, this is a topic that deserves more than a one off
conversation because it is important to be able to demonstrate to RTD’s
constituency that RTD is taking steps to move forward. He noted that the would
revise the resolution as to not tie anyone’s hands, but noted that the resolution
needs to be framed in a way that works under the law, and within the reality that
RTD is operating in. He added that he would be in favor of a resolution because
the public needs to hear the Board say they are committed to FasTracks.

6.C

presented soon and the Board should see what that document has before
committing to the language in this resolution.
Director Walker said that RTD offers other services such as the Flatiron Flyer and
the Bolt. He added that locking money away in order to finish a project does not
accomplish the goal of moving people efficiently and providing riders with options.

Committee Chair Lubow remarked that the escrow account in item six was
intended to be used as a leverage fund. She said that her hope was that it would
be used to leverage funds from private sources to fund the unfunded corridors.
Committee Chair Lubow said that more work needed to be done on this, and she
asked Director Tisdale to assist her in drafting a more palatable resolution.

Director Anderson stated that Chair Hoy brought up an important part of the budget

General Manager presents his 2018 Core and Task Goal Plan
General Manager Genova said the committee had asked for goals in memo format
with bullet points. He said his memo is different from the Excel spreadsheets used
in years past and is organized by five core goals and three strategic goals that were
approved at the retreat. He described the layout of each goal would be the same
throughout the document and began speaking to the core goals, which are derived

from the job description for the General Manager position. He delineated the metrics
of each of the three performance categories: Needs improvement, achieved goal,
and exceeds expectations.
General Manager Genova presented his first core goal regarding the successful
delivery of transit services to the district.

General Manager Genova said that hitting that 79% mark would put his
performance in the “achieved goal” category. He said the Board has the flexibility
to judge his performance against the performance benchmarks but noted that the
agency hit 89% of KPI’s in 2016.
Chair Hoy asked for clarification about the performance metrics.
General Manager Genova said that the agency uses 42 KPI’s and said that meeting
37 of the 42 goals would yield a performance of 88%. He noted that meeting 29 of
42 goals would place his performance in the “needs improvement” category.
Chair Hoy noted that a performance of 80% would be in the “exceeds
expectations” category, 70-79% would be in the “met expectations” category”,
and below 70% would mean the General Manager “needs improvement”.
General Manager Genova noted that there are factors not necessarily under the
direct control of the General Manager, such as the budget.
Director Anderson said the agency has never been below 80% on KPI’s.
Barbara McManus, Executive Manager of the Board Office, noted that performance
elements had been added to the General Manager’s goals.
General Manager Genova concurred that three or four elements had been added.
Director Walker said that the 80% number is not a low threshold but rather a
number that shows achievement. He added that there are things beyond the
General Manager’s control and said that the General Manager cannot achieve a goal
he cannot control.
Director Sisk offered that the Board may direct the General Manager to reduce
service levels and said he does not think the General Manager should be penalized
for something beyond his control. He said the General Manager’s task was to
present a plan to maintain acceptable service levels, though the agency may not be
able to meet those levels. He said he did not think the performance measure was
fair to the General Manager.
Packet Pg. 40

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jul 18, 2017 3:00 PM (Committee Reports)

Committee Chair Francone asked how the General Manager would be scored if he
the agency met 79% of key performance indicators (KPI’s).

6.D

Director Walker said the General Manager needs only to present a plan to maintain
service levels, even though the Board may not follow it.
Director Sisk questioned what would happen if the General Manager proposed a
plan to keep service levels steady, despite knowing that that level of service could
not be maintained due to budgetary reasons.

General Manager Genova responded that the performance goals include indicators
regarding a balanced budget as well as a balanced Strategic Business Plan (SBP)
and Annual Performance Evaluation (APE).
Director Anderson likened the service levels to the “achieved goal” category for
PTI’s, in that the goal gives the Board room to determine the General Manager’s
performance. She said not every goal can be quantitative and the Board itself has
to use good judgement.
Committee Chair Francone said that there must be some flexibility in the process
because there is subjectivity in the General Manager’s performance review.
Ms. McManus confirmed the committee’s consensus on the goal.
With regard to the agency’s response to special events, Committee Chair Francone
said that there’s vague language and room for interpretation regarding what makes
an event “outstanding” and “noteworthy”. She said it would be the General
Manager’s task to demonstrate that something is noteworthy.
General Manager Genova said there are several events not planned for every year,
such as the Women’s March in 2017, as well as a large contingency from US36.
Committee Chair Francone asked what would be considered an “outstanding” or
“noteworthy” event as described in the goal.
Director Sisk said he is interested in the General Manager amplifying those events,
such as the aforementioned Women’s March and the Bolder Boulder race.
Chair Hoy said that some special services, such as Broncos Ride, are just a part of
the regular service provided by RTD.
General Manager Genova said that, with certain services such as the Broncos Ride,
the difficulty of providing service depends on the schedule.

Packet Pg. 41

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jul 18, 2017 3:00 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Anderson said the General Manager must also present a plan to preserve
the integrity of the budget, otherwise the agency would be in trouble.

6.D

Chair Hoy agreed and noted in 2017 the Broncos would play a home game on
Thursday after schools start.

Director Anderson noted that the “outstanding and noteworthy events” criterion
was added to the General Manager’s last year to account for events such as the
Broncos parade following their Super Bowl win and other such events that quickly
require a large volume of bus service.
Ms. McManus noted the agency is also involved in providing emergency services.
Director Sisk said that those events are certainly unexpected, such as the flood in
northern Colorado in 2013.
Director Anderson also mentioned the Aurora theater shooting. She said that the
description could be changed to “unscheduled” events.
Chair Hoy suggested the language could read “reacting to special community
events”.
Director Anderson suggested that the General Manager’s performance on certain
events alone could qualify him for the “exceeds expectation” performance
category, because some events are so spectacular as to stand on their own.
Chair Hoy asked whether that would mean negative points could be assigned to the
General Manager’s performance if does not respond to such circumstances.
General Manager Genova suggested that the agency would always react to
extraordinary circumstances and would reflect positively rather than negatively.
Chair Hoy agreed.
Committee Chair Francone reiterated that the General Manager would be adding
language to his performance goal, and General Manager Genova said he would be
adding “unscheduled” events.
Director Walker said that evaluating the General Manager’s performance for all
scheduled events is appropriate.
General Manager Genova described his “communication” core goal and its review
criteria.
Packet Pg. 42

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jul 18, 2017 3:00 PM (Committee Reports)

General Manager Genova said that the BroncosRide for that Thursday game is an
example of a regularly scheduled service with incredibly challenging days. He noted
that RTD also experiences clumps of events, when the agency provides peak
service, plus BroncosRide, plus RockiesRide.

6.D

Director Sisk asked how the Board would know if the General Manager
communicates with the Senior Leadership Team (SLT).
General Manager Genova said that he conducts weekly meetings and sends out his
Monday Morning Dispatch.
Director Sisk asked whether SLT still conducts FasTracks meetings on Fridays.

Committee Chair Francone said the onus is on the General Manager to articulate to
the Board what he has been communicating with SLT.
General Manager Genova said he would describe his efforts in his upcoming
document and report on such things as employee forums, visits to different
divisions, and annual employee awards.
Ms. McManus asked whether the committee was in consensus, and there was no
other discussion.
General Manager Genova then spoke about the “strong financial leadership” core
goal and its performance criteria.
Committee Chair Francone said the “exceeded expectation” performance category
does not have very detailed language. She said the use of the words “substantial”
and “aggressive” give the General Manager an opportunity to promote himself.
Director Broom said that RTD’s financial health is an area that the General Manager
does not have much control over. He said RTD needs projects on the shelf in order
to qualify for certain grant funds. He stated that the transportation funding bill is
rolled over year to year and is eventually replaced, leading to changes in the grant
programs available.
General Manager Genova mentioned a current bus grant with a short application
window that recently became available. He said RTD has a nimble team to respond
to such opportunities and that the agency has to look at the SBP and know how to
shuffle things around.
Committee Chair Francone said she was impressed by how nimble the agency has
been over the last few years.
Director Sisk said one of the things he would like to see the committee consider is
the ability to work with other agencies such as CDOT. He said the committee
Packet Pg. 43

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jul 18, 2017 3:00 PM (Committee Reports)

General Manager Genova said that the FasTracks meetings had been rolled into the
Wednesday SLT meetings, because there were fewer day-to-day tasks for
FasTracks.

6.D

should include in the goal an item about working with communities where doing so
would achieve savings for both the municipalities and RTD.
Committee Chair Francone asked whether such an item was in the task goals.
General Manager Genova said the fiscal sustainability task goal contained a similar
item.

Chair Hoy reiterated that the type of partnerships would be ones that take a
creative, out of the box, form.
Director Anderson asked how much outside money had been contributed to the
Southeast Rail Extension (SERE).
General Manager Genova said RTD’s local partners raised 14% of the cost to
complete the project.
Ms. McManus asked the General Manager to summarize the amended language.
General Manager Genova said the language would read: “Partners with another
organization to realize funding or savings above what RTD could have achieved
independently”.
Director Broom said that a local match shows the municipalities have skin in the
game.
General Manager Genova noted that local matching funds make a difference to
grantors.
Director Walker said he understood the aim of the goal and said that the new
language may be too close to another goal, making it redundant. He suggested that
one goal could be for private funding and one goal for public funding but said that
goal could become confusing due to creative financing.
Ms. McManus noted that the agency is embarking on a period of operations and
maintenance and offered that funding could be realized outside of capital programs.
General Manager Genova said that was a good example. He said the agency may
be able to leverage other local dollars to do more in local jurisdictions. He
mentioned that Bruce Abel, Acting Chief Operating Officer and Assistant General
Manager of Bus Operations, was invited to talk to Denver City Council
transportation committee about partnering to purchase buying routes, similar to
what Boulder has done.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jul 18, 2017 3:00 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Anderson said that US36 or the TREX project would be good examples.

6.D

General Manager Genova said there will be a lot of conversation about regional
transportation authorities (RTA’s). He said the spirit of RTA’s is that they should
not conflict with RTD. He said that he has been hearing from staff in the Mayor’s
office that they do not want to compete against RTD or provide transit but rather
fill in gaps in transportation. He noted that Denver’s potential general obligation
(GO) bond issue did not contain any provisions about transit and were mostly
concerned with things such as improvements and connections.

Director Anderson said that RTD provides service in locations of highest ridership,
such as the Route 15L corridor.
Director Broom said that things change and used Stapleton and Lowry as examples.
Committee Chair Francone asked if the committee had come to consensus, and
there were no objections.
General Manager Genova presented his fourth core goal regarding equal opportunity
(EEO), affirmative action (AA), small business enterprise (SBE), and disadvantaged
business enterprise (DBE).
Committee Chair Francone asked whether the agency’s federal triennial review was
successful.
General Manager Genova said RTD had performed well. He said he would be
reporting the results to the Board.
Director Broom inquired whether FasTracks is winding down.
General Manager Genova said that FasTracks was comprised of $5.6 billion in
issued contracts. He said the agency has done great things with DBE and SBE.
Director Broom then asked whether the percentage DBE and SBE performance goals
for agency contracts would relate to the percentage of the contract, rather than for
dollar amount.
General Manager Genova confirmed. He said that the agency has hit its percentage
goals every year and that the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) recognizes that.
He said the goal is challenging because the agency sets the bar high for SBE and
DBE participation and continues to raise that. He said the agency will have fewer
construction opportunities going forward but is looking into operations and
maintenance opportunities for SBE and DBE, such as snow removal and custodial
services.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jul 18, 2017 3:00 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Broom said that Denver is taking a risk, because knowing where the city
invests its money could cause RTD to spend its funds elsewhere.

6.D

Director Anderson asked whether companies have graduated out of that program.
General Manager Genova confirmed and said that one company in the program
started as 10-person firm and has grown to a staff of over 100. He said that
another area the agency actively pursues is making DBE’s and SBE’s the primaries
on contracts and noted that Triunity Hill is a DBE firm that uses a larger, non-DBE
firm as a subcontractor. He said that firms are like people in that some want to
expand and some want to stay as they are.

Chair Hoy noted that this final core goal only contained one criterion in the
“exceeds expectations” category.
General Manager Genova said that the “one of the following” language preceding
the single item could be deleted.
Committee Chair Francone said she struggle with the communications goal because
it is difficult to measure.
General Manager Genova offered an example of being able to describe services
available in a given district. He said it was his task to be able to describe why
communications are effective. He said that, with respect to service change
meetings, the agency has discussed ways of increasing participation. He said the
agency almost always makes changes after community input.
Director Anderson said that service change meetings were attended by hundreds
when routes were cut. She said it is hard to gauge what peaks the community’s
interest.
Director Walker said a negative impact always gets more reaction and said that the
success of the communication effort does not depend on the turnout.
Director Sisk asked whether the General Manager speaks to groups in each
Director’s district.
General Manager Genova said that he tries to get to all places by participating with
stakeholder groups and does district-by-district outreach through Communications.
Director Sisk said there are ample opportunities for outreach.
General Manager Genova said that one of his objectives for Nate Currey, Senior
Manager of Public Relations and Public Information, both for education and
exposure, which he said can be effective.
Director Sisk said he would see such efforts as exceeding goals.
Packet Pg. 46

General Manager Genova presented his final core goal regarding communication.

6.D

Director Broom said that when he and Director Tisdale were running for office, they
had public debates that were recorded in one district and broadcast elsewhere. He
suggested the General Manager could talk about new pass programs with a
municipality, and they could then share the footage.
Ms. McManus confirmed that the committee did not have any changes to the goal.

Committee Chair Francone asked whether the request for proposals (RFP) for digital
advertising had been released.
General Manager Genova said that his goal was to install latest technology public
information displays (PID’s) that have information and alternate with ads and could
be installed either as a cost-neutral project or even as a revenue generator. He said
he the agency would be looking for a tech company to work with an advertising
firm to be able to roll this out at no cost to RTD, and the displays would need to be
refreshed every few years. He suggested that, under this contract, Park-n-Ride
displays could be dynamic. He noted that different groups have express interest
and noted that the “exceeded expectation” criterion would result from a contract
award for the project. He said that a balance must be maintained between
passenger information and commerce. He said there are many internal technology
questions, and the agency does not want people to get behind our firewall.
Director Broom said there is driverless vehicle used in industrial parks that goes
from stop to stop. He said there may be applications for such a vehicle in the
district, such as in DTC and Lakewood and along US36.
General Manager Genova said the agency is engaged in conversations with various
groups, one being Commuting Solutions, about running an autonomous vehicle on
the University of Colorado Boulder campus. He said Panasonic is interested in
running a shuttle in their smart city between campus and one of RTD’s stops.
Ms. McManus confirmed the committee had reached consensus on the item.
General Manager Genova address his second strategic goal, workforce human
capital. He clarified the Board controls salaried pension plans but cannot make
recommendations on union health and welfare and union pension. He spoke about
education programs and the employee recognition event that took place at Elitch
Gardens on July 15, 2017. He thanked the Board for supporting that event and said
the agency had not held a similar employee event since 2001. He also mentioned
that the Board had approved a $1.00 per hour wage increase for operators. He said
the agency is working out language with the union and would let employees know
soon.

General Manager Genova then spoke to his task goals, starting with fiscal
sustainability. He said the task goals for 2018 were similar to 2017’s goals.

6.D

Director Broom said he had heard from an operator that $21.50 is the top of the
pay scale for operators.
Director Anderson said the operators’ benefits are good.

General Manager Genova said that, given the economy, the employees face
challenges. He said RTD starts operators at $16.11, and that the agency is going to
be challenged in 2018 to have a competitive package. He mentioned that in 2016
the agency put in place measures to increase hiring and retention. He said retention
is the key, noting that the hours are hard on employees and it takes them a while to
get used to the lifestyle adjustment of working to reduce splits. He questioned
whether the time frame for operators to reach maximum pay should be shorter.
Director Broom said that there is no career there for operators.
General Manager Genova said that prospective employees do not need a lot of skills
to work in RTD, only need clean driving record and a drug screen. He said they
receive a commercial driver’s license (CDL) from RTD along with six-week training
program. He said employees do move from operator to dispatcher, to assistant
manager, to street supervisor, etc. He said there is opportunity and that the agency
works to try to develop them. He said that, for bus and rail operators, the agency is
currently at 90% of total headcount and that a 5% increase would yield an
“exceeds expectation” assessment for the goal.
Director Williams asked whether the hiring goal accounted for the unemployment
rate.
General Manager Genova said that he wanted to give the agency something to
shoot for and that meeting any one of the goals would be very challenging. He said
those goals are important as an agency and so the agency has to reach.
Director Broom said that people are being burned out and driven away.
Chair Hoy said he would like to challenge people to talk to bus operators about
what they do and do not like about their jobs.
Director Williams asked if other RTD employees could be made temporary
operators.
General Manager Genova said that the agency has looked at that concept and it
was decided that many issues could arise.

Packet Pg. 48

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jul 18, 2017 3:00 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Broom said that people the agency is trying to hire do not look at benefits.

6.D

Ms. McManus asked whether there might be problems with the union, and General
Manager Genova said yes.
Committee Chair Francone asked what happens if the agency does not complete
union negotiations before the expiration of the collective bargaining agreement
(CBA).

General Manager Genova said that, during the last negotiation, RTD and the union
focused on the top four or five items of discussion and would try that approach
again.
Director Broom said that the union may be reluctant to sign another five-year CBA.
Director Anderson agreed and said that five years ago was a totally different
economic time. She said the last negotiation was excellent.
General Manager Genova said that that the agency is contemplating whether to
enter into another five-year CBA as well. He then discussed the third strategic goal,
achieving a state of good repair. He said that a state of good repair has been
federally mandated and that RTD is in good shape because the agency started to
address the issue years ago. He noted that safety and asset management are
tightly intertwined. He discussed what it means for an asset to be in backlog and
how the agency would determine whether an asset can continue to operate.
Director Broom said he was still concerned with union pension plan. He said that
the RTD cannot say that the insolvent pension fund is solely the union’s problem.
He said that, in reality, insolvency impacts employees, which will impact district.
He said the district will not go into bankruptcy but stated there is no federal
pension insurance that would ensure the union pension fund would be saved. He
asked whether two-tiered employee pension plans had been contemplated.
General Manager Genova said the trust that oversees the union pension and health
and welfare plan is made up of three union and three management representatives.
He said they meet once or twice each month and have been talking about creative
solutions, such as a two-tiered pension system. He said that the union’s position is
that the insolvency is RTD’s issue to fix.
Director Broom said that, even if the pension is not RTD’s problem, RTD will be
impacted.
General Manager Genova said he struggled with the problem. He said the
employees work hard. He noted that a change to the union pension plan in 2011
Packet Pg. 49

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jul 18, 2017 3:00 PM (Committee Reports)

General Manager Genova said that, in his time with RTD, the CBA has only been
finalized once prior to the expiration.

6.D

made it so that new employees get less of a multiplier for years of service than
existing employees.
Chair Hoy said the vesting period for employees had been five years.

General Manager Genova said he would look into it. He said that one model the
pension trust considered placed new employees to into a defined contribution (DC)
plan. He said right now RTD contributes 13% to the employee’s pension plan, and
the trust looked into splitting that contribution, in which case 9% would go into the
newer employees’ DC plans, and 4% would go into existing employees defined
benefit (DB) plans. He said the agency is also considering making lump sum
contributions and has done so previously to bolster the health and welfare fund.
Director Broom asked whether retirees were given employee-sponsored medical
plans.
General Manager Genova said that retirees are not offered medical plans and that
the health & welfare plan only applies for working employees. He said Director
Broom’s point about solvency is a good one, because whether or not maintaining
the solvency of the fund is a legal obligation, it is a moral obligation.
Chair Hoy noted that the represented pension underperformed compared to the
salaried pension fund. He said the agency appointed new representation to the
agency’s side of the pension trust. He said that decisions made by the union
pension trust had not been as good as those made by the salaried pension trust.
Director Broom said the sooner the problem is addressed, the better.
Director Williams said she would abstain from the vote because she had not been
present for enough of the meeting.

B. Introduction of Thor, RTD K-9 Officer (No Backup)
Committee Chair Anderson said that the Board had a special treat tonight as Thor,
RTD’s newest K-9 transit police officer, would be introduced.
Bruce Abel, Acting Chief Operations Officer/Assistant General Manager of Bus
Operations, said asked Chief Bob Grado, Sergeant Amy Homyak and Thor, the
wonder dog, to come forward to be introduced.
Bob Grado, Transit Police Chief, said that Thor, RTD’s newest member of the
transit police force, is with us tonight. He stated RTD was able to adopt Thor
through a grant from the Department of Homeland Security and that Sergeant
Homyak and Thor had just completed twelve weeks of training together.
Committee Chair Anderson said that Thor was one of the cuddliest police officers
that RTD has ever had.
Director Walker inquired about Thor’s specialties and asked what he had been
trained to do.
Sergeant Homyak said that Thor was a detection dog, and he spends a great deal
of his time at Union Station. She added that she and Thor also devote as much
time as they can throughout the district.
Committee Chair Anderson said that she was excited and looks forward to seeing
Thor around the district.

C. Recommended Actions

• Enter into a Contract with RouteMatch for MDT and On-Board Software for
Access-a-Ride
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the
Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to
execute all documents necessary to award a contract for computerized
Packet Pg. 53

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jul 18, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Deadwyler participated via phone. Director Folska was absent.

6.E

Mobile Data Terminals (MDTs) and onboard software with RouteMatch
Software, Inc. (RouteMatch) (Contract Number 17DH025) for an amount
not to exceed $1,800,000.
The price includes MDTs, software,
implementation and three years of extended support.
Motion:

Director Tisdale made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the July 25, 2017
Board Meeting.

Discussion:

Mr. Abel said that in 2008 RTD went live with the
RouteMatch software and in 2009 went live with the Mobile
Data Terminals (MDTs). He stated that the current MDTs
have reached the end of their useful life and staff is unable to
make upgrades to the devices. He stated that staff is working
with RouteMatch to make necessary updates as needed, but
the current devices have high failure rates and are difficult to
procure. He explained that it was imperative that the MDTs
be replaced so that staff can have an up-to-date solution to
react to real time changes, and staff appreciated the
committee referring this action item to the full Board for
approval.
Director Menten noted that the current MDTs were purchased
in 2009 and the end of useful life was reached years ago. She
asked what guarantees RTD has to ensure the new devices
will last longer than three years and inquired if there was a
warranty.
Eric Farrington, Senior Project Manager, explained that RTD
got a good five to six years out of the original devices. He
said that the current MDTs are requiring additional service and
there are no replacements available. He noted that the new
devices chosen by staff are a second generation of the original
devices currently in use, and the extended support will cover
the devices for three years.
Director Lubow commented that this was a sole source
contract. She asked what criteria was met in order to have
this as a sole source, and asked that Board Reports include the
supplementary information for sole source criteria.
Mr. Farrington explained that RouteMatch software handles
scheduling and manifests for the agency. He said the
Packet Pg. 54

Director Williams seconded the motion.

6.E

software on other vehicles must match the software on buses,
and this contract accomplishes that requirement.

Director Solano stated that this was great, and if it made the
system work better, he would support this 100 percent.
Director Deadwyler asked if this software would improve the
GPS on buses.
Mr. Farrington stated that the software will include GPS on the
buses. He added that there will be an external antenna added
to improve the signal, and it will use live maps to ensure they
are always up to date.
Committee Chair Anderson remarked that this was fantastic
and will allow RTD to be much more efficient and to meet
ADA passengers needs easier and quicker.
Director Deadwyler commented that she would be voting in
favor of this item.

• Enter into a Contract with INIT for Automatic Passenger Counters for Light
Rail Vehicles
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that
the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to
execute all documents necessary to award a contract for purchase,
installation and maintenance of Automatic Passenger Counters (APCs) with
INIT Innovations in Transportation, Inc. (INIT) (Contract Number 17DH026)
Packet Pg. 55

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jul 18, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Mr. Abel remarked that in 2008 RTD used Trapeze software.
He stated that it is desirable to have an integrated system, and
if there are two separate vendors, there will always be a
disconnect between the two programs. He noted that RTD’s
strategy is to have a single point of software to make sure
that it works.

for an amount not to exceed $2,400,000 and transfer up to $950,000 from
project 10444 (Mobile Data Terminals) to project 10345 (New Automatic
Passenger Counter).
Motion:

Director Tisdale made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the July 25, 2017
Board Meeting.

Discussion:

Mr. Abel stated that in some respects, this action is a partner
to the previous item. He commented that currently, RTD uses
Automatic Passenger Counters (APCs) to monitor passenger
boardings as well as on-time performance. He said that the
goal was to use the same APCs that are used on the fixed
route system, and it was determined that it would be more
beneficial and cost efficient to have RouteMatch update the
APCs. He noted that currently, only 42 light rail vehicles, or
24%, had passenger counters and that presented quite a
challenge in providing correct passenger totals. He explained
that with approval of this item, staff will be able to acquire
and supplement an APC project that is already on the books to
improve passenger counting and on-time performance of light
rail. He further added that staff wants to enter a sole source
contract so that it is identical to existing bus and rail light
counters.
Director Broom asked if this device can distinguish between
someone getting on or off a vehicle.
Mr. Farrington said yes.
Director Broom asked if on-time performance was scaled to
the number of passengers per vehicle.
Mr. Abel commented that RTD measures on-time performance
by vehicle on-time performance only.
Director Francone remarked that the Board just approved $1.8
million for the MDTs. She asked if there were left over funds
that were applied to this contract.
Mr. Abel said yes, there were funds left over from the original
contract.

Packet Pg. 56

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jul 18, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Solano seconded the motion.

6.E

Director Francone inquired how staff accurately calculates ontime performance for light rail since only a small percentage of
light rail vehicles have passenger counters.
Mr. Abel explained that there is a lot of math involved. He
remarked that information is communicated from service and
planning to light rail and collected to form a sample for on-time
performance.

Chair Hoy asked if the new devices would be more accurate,
and if so, would that make performance numbers increase or
decrease.
Mr. Abel stated that the new devices would allow staff to
measure on-time performance more accurately. He noted that
staff expects a change as they will have a more accurate
picture, but he could not say if it would go up or down.
Director Solano asked if staff would be able to compare
revenue per train with the new devices.
Mr. Abel commented that this hardware itself will do not do
that, as revenue comes in at the Ticket Vending Machines
(TVMs), but he said that staff would have a better
understanding of the ridership of each line.
Director Lubow inquired if every vehicle at RTD would be
equipped with this technology.
Mr. Abel stated that it is a desirable goal, but it will take time.
Director Tisdale asked if the $2.4 million for the project budget
will be offset by other funds.
Mr. Farrington noted that the total budget will not exceed
$2.4 million. He noted that there are different sources of
funds, and some will be used to maintain the equipment over
time.
Director Deadwyler inquired if this software could be used to
measure and compare boardings with the fares that are
collected.
Packet Pg. 57

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jul 18, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Francone stated that it was an incredible amount of
work, and this purchase will improve that process.

6.E

Mr. Abel said that better passenger count information would
provide the finance department with better information to
allocate funds to the various lines.
Director Deadwyler asked if RTD could count boardings to see
that everyone on board had paid.

Director Deadwyler commented that she would be voting in
favor of this item.
Director Walker added that this technology is not new to RTD,
it is just more of what is already out there.
Mr. Abel remarked that Director Walker was correct, and said
that this is an expansion of a current project.

D. Updates

 16th Street Mall Update (No Backup)
Mr. Abel stated that Jessie Carter and Susan Wood would assist with this
update.
Susan Wood, Planning Project Manager, stated that it is staffs goal to
provide the Board with periodic updates about the 16th street mall. She said
that the project kicked off on May 2nd, and the first of three workshops have
been held. She noted that General Manager Genova was at the kick-off
meeting and his opening remarks were well received. She stated that the
first workshop was a broad study that included the history of the mall and
tours of the mall. She noted that staff’s goal at this time is to be able to
utilize grant money that is being held until the project details are finalized.
She remarked that the next workshop will be September 6th – 8th, 2017 and

Mr. Abel stated that fare checks are performed through fare
inspections in Chief Grado’s group. He noted that over the
years, RTD has developed a more robust fare inspection
system as part of the smart card project.

6.E

will focus on options and preferred alternatives and the third workshop will
delve into the preferred alternatives. She added that the goal is to finish the
environmental assessment by the end of 2017. She further noted that
upcoming public outreach events are scheduled for July 22nd, 2017, from
12:00-4:00 p.m. during the Denver Meet in the Street event, and on July
27th, 2017, RTD will host a public open house at 12:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m.
in order to get additional public feedback.

Mr. Abel explained that the purpose of the first workshop was to determine
what common elements existed. He said that the second workshop will
focus on the common elements as it is important to collectively understand
the agreed upon guiding principles, such as the 16th Street MallRide staying
on 16th Street.
Director Menten asked if it will be clear at the open house on the 27th that
maintenance costs are extreme and part of the mall is unsafe.
Ms. Wood said that the purpose being articulated concerns the very specific
maintenance that has to be performed.
Mr. Abel said that including maintenance costs in the purpose and needs
statement is an excellent recognition of what is important.
General Manager Genova commented that maintenance costs are a point he
makes every time he discusses the mall as granite pavers are not a material
that would be installed in contemporary designs. He added that he met with
the Denver Post and thought the conversation was very informative.
Director Francone said that she did not want granite pavers included in the
updated design and wanted to make sure that RTD only pays for the
roadway as that is what RTD is contractually obligated to do. She added
that there are a lot of pretty designs out there, but there are no costs
attributed to them. She further stated that if there is a cost consideration
with those designs, the public should know what it will cost, as well as the
maintenance costs.
Director Broom asked if this process examines the current public use of the
mall, and if it would also estimate its future use.
Mr. Abel said yes. He noted that part of the conversation staff has had
concerns the critical role the mall plays in RTD’s network. He stated that
utilization will continue, and mall shuttle services will be expanded. He
Packet Pg. 59

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jul 18, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Jessie Carter, Service Planning and Scheduling Manager, commented that
this process has a lot of different viewpoints to sort through and
communicate to the public.

6.E

added that as rail services grow, staff will need to adjust service in order to
carry the expected number of people projected to use the mall.
Chair Hoy remarked that the Board will not approve the use of expensive
pavers in the future. He added that earlier in the day, he observed a heavy
garbage truck travel down 16th Street and said that RTD should not pay to
repair roadways that heavy garbage trucks are using.

Mr. Abel said that staff is anticipating that the Civic Center Station will be
completed by the first of November. He stated that staff is evaluating the
need to do a run-board change because RTD’s scheduling systems contain
all of the downstream public information systems. He added that staff will
need to change all of the internal systems to address the re-opening of Civic
Center Station and are hopeful that they can do it with a simple back-end IT
change without having a new run-board.

• Lost Service Hours Update 7 18 17
Mr. Abel stated that the lost service hours update was included in the
Operations & Customer Service Committee packet. He said that in the
month of June, 203 hours were lost compared to 117 hours from June of
2016. He noted that year to date, 1,400 hours have been lost compared to
2,400 last year. He remarked that RTD is still showing improvement, but
the downside is that staff is still having to mandate operators. He
commented that RTD is 130 operators shy, but there has been improvement
from the customer perspective, and staff can demonstrate improvement
efforts.
Committee Chair Anderson asked staff to thank all of the operators who are
mandated and working so many overtime hours.
Mr. Abel added that staff would communicate the thanks and appreciation
from the Board for all of the operators who are working extra hours to
maintain service.

E. Other Matters
There were no other matters.

B. Recommended Actions

• Resolution to Approve Refinancing for Interest Savings
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the
“Resolution”), authorizing the execution and delivery by the RTD of a lease
purchase agreement and related documents in connection with the partial
refinancing of the 2010A and 2015A Certificates of Participation.
Motion:

Director Anderson made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the July 25, 2017
Board Meeting.
Director Tisdale seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Brenden Morgan, Senior Manager of Debt and Investments,
said that staff is planning to refund portions of series 10A and
2015A Certificates of Participation (COPs). He noted that
current low interest rates will allow RTD to refinance the COPs
for significant savings. He said that RTD will be refinancing
with JP Morgan Chase, and the proposal was also reviewed by
RTD’s investment advisor. He commented that the
transaction was deemed to be competitive and it also has
benefits such as not having to pay the credit rating agencies
for their fee. He said that over the next eight years, to 2025,
the savings would be $13 million. He added that the cost of
the issueance would be $200,000, but that is a minimal cost
when looking at the overall savings. He further noted that the
savings would be split between the Base system and
FasTracks.

Director Deadwyler participated via phone. Director Folska was absent.

6.F

Director Broom asked if there would be a substantial loss of
escrow.
Mr. Morgan said yes, and RTD will have to continue to pay
arbitrage, but the yield curve is pretty flat. He remarked that
the cost was netted out with the savings.

Mr. Morgan said, that since banks are in the business of
loaning money, their benefit is the same as anyone else that
would participate in COPs, and they would earn interest
income of 2.5%.
Director Lubow further inquired as to why more banks were
not offering this or being competitive.
Mr. Morgan explained that in 2013, RTD found that most
banks would not be very competitive or interested. He said
that in 2016 JP Morgan Chase provided RTD a proposal they
felt would be a good fit for both entities. He added that it is
not always a good fit, but in this case, it did work out well.
Heather McKillop, Chief Financial Officer/Assistant General
Manager of Finance and Administration, commented that not
all banks have the same portfolio. She stated that RTD had
received proposals in the past that did not work for RTD, but
this one just happened to be a match for both RTD and JP
Morgan Chase at this time.
Director Deadwyler remarked that she did not have any
questions, but she would vote in the affirmative for this item.

C. Updates

• SB17-267 Retail Marijuana Taxes (no backup)

Mr. Asphaug, stated that the title of SB267 was “Concerning the
Sustainability of Rural Colorado” and said that it was a 58-page long bill that
had a lot of moving parts. He explained that it has taken funds away from
RTD, the Scientific and Cultural Facilities District (SCFD), and hundreds of
other tier three organizations. He noted that directly, this has affected RTD
to the amount of $500,000 a month. He stated that there is a large number
of agencies that are being impacted and from a legislative standpoint, and it
looks as if the move will be to address this at the next session, though there
is discussion of a special session. He remarked that, from a legal
standpoint, RTD had met with attorneys from SCFD to see if there is
anything that can be done, but at this time, the agency is keeping all of its
options open. He noted that the best option at this time is to encourage the
legislature to have a special session.
Chair Hoy said that it was his understanding that if an organization asked
the Governor to call a special session, there may be a financial burden to the
legislature. He said that he would be in favor of paying for the special
session if that were to happen.
Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager of Communications, commented that
RTD has been in discussion with other special districts and there is no
consensus at this point.
Chair Hoy asked if consensus was needed. He said that $500,000 a month
is worth the cost of a special session and added that, if the rest of the
special districts do not want to go along, RTD can lead the effort without
them.
Director Lubow asked if there was any pushback on making the correction.
Ms. McKillop stated that most people are in favor of making the correction,
but staff anticipates there will be some pushback.
Director Tisdale said that if RTD waits until January or later to address this
problem, by then it will be a $3 million plus problem, and if the legislature
does not act, it will be another $1 million every two months. He remarked
that RTD had an expectation that this funding would continue, especially
since there was no discussion that it would be discontinued. He echoed

Ms. McKillop stated that Rolf Asphaug, General Counsel, would start off the
conversation and she would answer any budget questions.

6.F

Chair Hoy’s sentiment to bring this up and said that it is the Governor’s role
to step up and have the legislature take care of this. He added that RTD
should not have to ask for a special session and he hoped everyone is called
and that they show up to fix this.

Committee Chair Menten commented that she had read the entire bill and it
contains a lot of parts. She noted that the bill was very controversial and it
would be even more so when it is opened back up for discussion. She
added that she was interested to know what the regulations on calling a
special session were in regards to deadlines.
Ms. McKillop said that the Senate has to have at least three days to pass a
bill, and it would cost $20,000 to $30,000 per day. She added that there
are rules around the title, and how it would be set up. She further noted
that the special session should only cover one issue, but at this point in time
she could not be sure that would happen.
Mr. Asphaug added that RTD had not made any statement for or against the
special session.
Director Williams said that RTD recently joint a conglomeration by joining
Mobility Choice. She asked if RTD could ask them to pull their leverage to
get a special session called.
Director Broom remarked that RTD pays a lobbying firm for their services
and RTD should ask them for their advice. He said that in some sense it
would be like opening Pandora’s box, but the agency will still run into the
same issue if the matter is discussed in January. He said that, if a special
session is called, the microscope would be on the legislature to correct the
problem and nothing else.
Director Francone commented that the Board had the discretion to hire
outside counsel for matters of the Board. She asked if there was any
comment from Sherry Ellebracht, RTD’s Government Relations Officer, and
possible solutions.
General Manager Genova stated that Ms. Ellebracht was out this week to
visit Colorado’s delegation in Washington, D.C.
Mr. Reed said that the media had reported an entire litany of possible
outcomes. He stated that administrative fixes seem to be off the table, but
there have been discussions about the possibility of the special districts
Packet Pg. 66

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jul 18, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Solano stated for reference that the Illinois Legislature’s special
session cost $48,000 a day. He stated that, even if the special session took
three days, RTD would still be ahead.

asking for a special session. He added RTD does not have good info or intel
at this time, and this would be better served during an off-line conversation.

General Manager Genova stated that he has daily conversations with BBMK,
but there are more issues to discuss. He said that he would prepare a
briefing with them for the Board.
Director Tisdale said his strong stated need of a special session is subject to
advice received from RTD’s lobbyists. He noted that the only two
possibilities are either it was a mistake, or someone had a sinister motive,
and in either case, no one will fess up. He stated that this is and will be
challenging, so counsel and RTD’s lobbyists should inform the Board on how
best to proceed.
Director Deadwyler commented that she agrees with everything that has
been said and she is going to sit back and see what happens.

• SBP Update
Ms. McKillop stated that she would hand out larger versions of the charts so
that the Board would be able to read them better.
Jannette Scarpino, Senior Manager of Budget & Financial Analysis, remarked
that in the June Financial Administration and Audit Committee, staff
presented the first draft and initial assumptions of the Strategic Budget Plan
(SBP). She noted that the approach in this second draft was to identify the
minimum must have needs, minimum fleet needs, and any remaining
projects permitted.
Ms. Scarpino stated that the SPB:
•

•

Includes only service and projects funded from the Base
System 0.6% sales and use tax, and operating activity from
FasTracks Operations funded by 0.4% tax
FasTracks future expense and projects are included separately
in the FasTracks Annual Program Evaluation (APE) financial
plan

Packet Pg. 67

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jul 18, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Francone inquired if that was something that Brandeberry-McKenna
(BBMK) could be tasked with, and if they could explore options. She added
that Chair Hoy was right and the thought that the bill would be fixed come
January is presumptuous. She further noted that it will not be a quick and
easy solution.

Ms. McKillop remarked that this update was different from last month, and
staff pushed out the adoption of the SPB until September.
Director Broom noted that staff estimated gas at $2.69 a gallon, and asked
if RTD pays gas taxes.
Mr. Abel commented that it depended on what was being reviewed. He said
that for contracted services RTD pays federal and state taxes for gasoline
because in some cases they are buying at the pump. He stated that fuel
that RTD purchases directly does not have taxes.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jul 18, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Ms. Scarpino said that the SBP cash flow in lines 11 and 19 carry the
minimum must have projects and feet needs to date. She noted that
graphically, the 2018 Base sources of funds include $697.7 million and the
use of funds equate to $694.4 million.

6.F

Director Lubow said that the SBP revenue assumptions showed that the
actual revenue percentage collected was 5.4%, whereas the baseline was
4%. She asked if it would be correct to say that, if RTD is having financial
issues, it is from expenses and not from the collection of sales and use
taxes.
Ms. McKillop said that assumption was incorrect. She reminded the Board
that $30 million was cut out of the budget during the amended budget
process and while staff can examine all of the operating costs, sales and use
taxes are the largest factor.

Ms. McKillop commented that Susan Cohen would begin the presentation,
and Bruce Abel would answer any questions the Board may have with
regards to service.
Susan Cohen, Senior Manager of Finance, stated that the program overview
contains:
•
•
•

$5.6 billion and there is also an additional $700,000 for a Federal Transit
Administration (FTA) after study.
Ms. Cohen said that changes for the 2017 Annual Program Evaluation (APE)

•

•

Project budget savings

Director Anderson commented that on the miscellaneous FasTracks slide,
there is a line item titled Program-wide Railroad Right of Way (ROW), and
inquired what that was for.
Ms. Cohen stated that RTD had to acquire ROW beyond the terminus to
which RTD was building the Gold Line, and those costs were attributed so
the FasTracks ROW.
Director Lubow said that one of the potential service reductions is for the N
Line, which has not started yet.
Mr. Abel explained that staff had reviewed all of the alternatives, and
wanted to share everything that was explored to see what makes the most
sense.
Committee Chair Menten said that considerations to reduce the shortfall are
only being discussed as potential solutions at this time and that nothing had
been identified as definite changes.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jul 18, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Considerations to Reduce Shortfall are:

6.F

Mr. Abel added that construction costs are one-time costs and operating
costs are ongoing. He stated that staff is evaluating every alternative to
review cost saving measures.

Mr. Abel stated that staff does maintain ridership numbers for the vital lines
because it is important for internal information. He said that information and
analysis would be provided to the Board.

• May 2017 Monthly Financial Status Report
Doug MacLeod, Controller, stated that these were the financials for May.
He noted that these figures were being compared to the amended budget
that the Board adopted in June. He further noted that, before the amended
budget, the approved budget was showing a lot of red. He stated that year
to date, sales and use taxes are up 2.5% and in comparison to 2016, RTD is
up $14.2 million, 6.5%. He remarked that 2016 compared to 2015, RTD is
up 4%. He explained that staff had budgeted a 4% increase for 2017 and
the numbers are running close to that figure. He noted that ridership is flat
compared to budget, however, the numbers are up 2.1% since last year. He
remarked that fare revenue is better than expected.
Director Anderson said that at a recent meeting, a well-known transportation
guru from Lakewood was in attendance and he wanted to know why it cost
him $9.00 to get to the airport from the closest station.
Mr. Abel said that the airport is a hard fare zone, and the trip from any
station to the airport is $9.00.
General Manager Genova said that, no matter how far someone rides, $9.00
is the airport fare. He noted that if someone is on the University of Colorado
A Line and they are not going to the airport, the zone structures apply.
Committee Chair Menten said that some people think that $9.00 is a deal,
since the original fare was $13.00.
Director Walker noted that he was in Chicago last month and the fare for
their train was $3.00 each way. He stated that the sight-seeing and people
watching was unbelievable, but it took forever to get to and from the
airport. He said that the value for the University of Colorado A Line is not
necessarily the length, but the time.

Packet Pg. 73

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jul 18, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Committee Chair Menten remarked that previously ridership for individual rail
lines were separated and she asked for that to be separated again so that
the Board can know how each line is performing.

6.F

General Manager Genova said that RTD went through a significant process
to establish the new fare rates in 2015. He noted that one of those rates
was the airport rate and there was a lot of discussion to determine the fare
type and rate. He noted that the Board collectively settled on a flat fare and
during that fare structure study, staff also considered getting rid of the
zones, but the public did not feel that was equitable. In addition to reducing
the rail zones by one, the bus fares were reduced to local and regional. He
said that staff will instruct security to make sure they understand how the
fare zones work and staff will perform additional outreach efforts. He added
that all of RTD’s maps and information explains the zone structure.
Director Solano asked if the airport fee was good for 24 hours.
General Manager Genova stated that the ticket would be good for the
service day, and is not a 24-hour pass.
Director Williams said that there are some advantages to the ticket, and her
friends think it is a great way to see the sights and the city.
Director Tisdale noted that sooner or later RTD will need to add a club car to
the University of Colorado A Line.

• SmartCard Project Update
Tonya Anderson, Manager of Electronic Fare Operations, said that the
MyRide portal sales are holding steady and in June there were 1,000
reloads, and for July, so far there have been 900. She noted that the retail
point of sales expansion went live on July 21, 2017, at King Soopers and
they are only reloading cards at this time. She stated that the platform
validator screen tests are underway and they are being tested with either a
fan, UV film, or both. She said that 15 of the 18 have had no issues, but
three of them are faulty. She stated that Conduent is investigating the three
validators, but they are considering modifying them for airflow and replacing
the screens.
Director Francone thanked the entire team and said that she has heard
nothing but enthusiastic and positive comments for the MyRide card.
Ms. McKillop remarked that RTD is getting more and more interest with the
cards. The said that the City and County of Denver purchased cards and
loaded funds for students, and they have issued over 1,500 cards to date.
Packet Pg. 74

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jul 18, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Deadwyler commented that she gets a lot of comments from people
that have a difficult time trying to figure out the zones and the fare
structure. She asked what RTD was doing as an agency to make it easier
for people to catch the train. She said that a lot of complaints she receives
are from people that ride from the Peoria Station to the airport.

6.F

She added that they are working through RTD’s existing system and they
are not benefiting from additional discounts, but they are excited about this
program as is staff.
Committee Chair Menten noted that the Board was asked to provide more
discounts to Denver’s students and the solution with the MyRide cards does
not require any additional work.

Ms. McKillop said that staff has informed people that, if they are in instant
need, they have options to load fund to their cards immediately.
General Manager Genova stated that the delay is only when people reload
their cards using the online portal.
Director Deadwyler said that people who have MyRide cards seem to like
them.

• Quarterly Audit Update
Ann Marie Isaac-Heslop, Internal & IT Audit Manager, said that she and
Kevin Parker, Senior Auditor would present information on areas that needed
explanation. She noted that Mr. Parker would discuss the MyRide card
implementation as he had been auditing that for a number of years.
Mr. Parker noted that the main concern was Payment Card Industry
Compliance (PCI) and disaster recovery testing. He said that those along
with a few other items are scheduled for 2017.
Ms. Isaac-Heslop stated that the overtime and extra shift report was
completed and a full copy will be provided to the Board. She noted that
Audit has worked tirelessly to come to an agreement on different actions
that management would time, and timelines for implementation. She added
that the FasTracks staffing audit is underway and it is very complex and
detail oriented.
Ms. Isaac-Heslop stated that, in regards to cyber security, RTD has come a
long way, but there is still a lot of work that needs to be done to be cyberresilient in order to fully address the inevitable cyber security incident.
Director Deadwyler asked about the status of the Access-a-Ride audit.
Ms. Isaac-Heslop said that Access-a-Ride and Call-n-Ride audits will begin in
August. She said that Audit will review the original objectives, and as of
now, Audit is preparing for the planning portion.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jul 18, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Committee Chair Menten asked if staff received negative feedback on the
24-48 hour reload period.

6.F

Director Broom asked if someone could shut down RTD’s rail lines by
hacking RTD’s system.

Director Anderson thanked staff for the hard job that they do. She stated
that, at the risk of being politically incorrect, she thought internal audits
were always a great management tool and it helps the General Manager and
all department heads do a better job managing their departments. She
stated that, as a Board member, she wants to know if someone made a
mistake and wants to know if Audit finds anything. She added that she was
concerned with cybersecurity, and it was also concerning to discuss it in an
open meeting, and said that she would speak off-line.

D. Other Matters
Director Francone said that the General Manager Oversight and Performance
Management Committee met earlier in the day and finalized the tasks and goals for
2018. She said that the information would be included in the Board packet on
Friday and noted that the survey would be emailed soon as well. She asked
everyone to complete the survey and to be prepared on Tuesday with any
questions they might have.
Director Walker commented that he serves on the Leadership APTA Committee. He
noted that Lacey Bell was chosen for 2018 and offered his congratulations.
General Manager Genova thanked the Board for the employee appreciation event on
Saturday, July 15th and said that it was incredible for all the employees.

every attack.

July Board Meeting Agenda Review
Chair Hoy asked for the committee’s any input on the July board agenda.
General Manager Genova said that the few recommended actions were on the
unanimous consent agenda.
Barbara McManus, Executive Manager of the Board Office, said the only added item
on the agenda was the approval of the General Manager’s performance goals for
2018 that was approved unanimously at the General Manager’s Oversight and
Performance Management Committee on July 18, 2017.
Motion: Chair Hoy made the motion to approve
moving the July 25th Board agenda to the full

Vote on
Motion: The motion passed with 4 in favor (Hoy,
Deadwyler, Walker, Menten) and 1 absent
(Francone).
Other Matters
Ms. McManus said that the General Manager’s revised memo to the Board, along
with the redlined version, would be in the Board packet that would be sent out the
following day.
Director Menten said that Anne Marie Isaac-Heslop, Internal Audit Manager,
recommended that the agency’s audit reports from the last three years be posted
online. Director Menten said that, as the chair of the Financial Administration and
Audit Committee, she did not see the need for a formal action, and Director Mihalik
had also approved of the recommendation.
Chair Hoy said that posting reports online was an administrative matter to be
determined by General Manager Genova and Ms. Isaac-Heslop.
Ms. McManus said that IT may need to be consulted on the matter because space
may be a concern.
Chair Hoy said that he could not believe space is expensive anymore and that the
issue should be checked out.
General Manager Genova replied that he would check into it.
Chair Hoy said the idea was a good one and that, if anyone in RTD should be
transparent, it is the auditor.
Director Deadwyler asked whether items posted to the agency’s website should be
prioritized.
Chair Hoy agreed and said, if there is not sufficient space, the most important items
should be prioritized.
Director Francone said that posting audits online is a wonderful idea as long as
space is not an issue and that she would like the Board to be notified when items
are posted.

General Manager Genova updated the committee on the potential for the Colorado
General Assembly to conduct a special session. He said that Rolf Asphaug, spoke
with Jenifer Brandeberry of Brandeberry McKenna (BBMK), who said she would be
happy to brief the next Government Relations Committee meeting. General Manager
Genova said he understands the earliest a special session could happen is in
September and that the agency cannot pay for it. He said that, following their
preliminary discussion, Mr. Asphaug and Ms. Brandeberry would not suggest
requesting a special session, because RTD would the focus and the agency may not
like the outcome. He said that Heather McKillop, Chief Financial Officer and
Assistant General Manager of Finance and Administration, had volunteered to put
together a timeline on the bill. He said the timeline would show at what point the
change to the bill occurred that affected RTD’s ability to collect marijuana taxes.
Director Deadwyler asked how long RTD would have to pay $500,000 per month.
General Manager Genova said that the agency does not pay but rather is unable to
collect a portion of sales tax.
Director Deadwyler asked whether the change was indefinite.
General Manager Genova said it would be indefinite unless changed.
Chair Hoy said the change affects RTD’s budget.
General Manager Genova agreed and said the change affects the revenue projected
part of the budget. He said the next Government Relations meeting would be held
on August 1, 2017. He mentioned that a new fiscal note had been generated on
SB17-267, this time, including RTD, which he said is a step in the right direction.
Director Francone said she had spoken with state legislators the previous weekend.
She said that some legislators would willingly reopen SB267 because they do not
like the bill. She said those individuals would not just fix the clerical error but rather
kill the bill. She said she wants to hear legal briefing on what the agency should do.
Director Deadwyler asked how the bill could be reopened.
General Manager Genova said RTD could ask the Governor to call a special session
and the agency would want to work with the Scientific and Cultural Facilities
District (SCFD) to avoid being the lone agency.
Chair Hoy said that it may take an agency like RTD to stand up.

Director Walker said that, during the last Executive Committee Meeting, he
mentioned he was looking into an issue with expense reports. He said his questions
and discussions dealt with the amount of certain expenses and the purpose of
those expense. He said he did some research and had asked Mr. Asphaug for
guidance. He said the provisions that cover expense reporting describe what
Directors can receive as gifts, and that those provisions were mostly from the
federal Internal Revenue Service (IRS), because some private sector expenses are
deductible. He said there is not a lot of guidance for elected officials. He noted that
a recurring phrase used to discuss expense says that expenses should be “ordinary
and necessary to the course of business” and “directly related or associated” to the
business. He said the expense report in question has been revised but is
uncharacteristically large compared to other reports the Director has submitted. He
said the fact that that the report is unusually high is what gives the Chair the ability
to bring it before the Executive Committee. He said that individually the expenses
are justifiable, but the sum total of the expenses is unusually high. He identified a
particularly large expense for a meal with one other person and one for an event
put on by a political organization.
Chair Hoy said that expense reports are typically around a certain amount per
month, but the one in question was much higher. He noted that the submitter of
that report had revised it.
Director Walker said that typically expenses as used in the ordinary course of
business require that the meeting should have the expectation of a contract given
or a step to a contract given. He said that Directors do not sign contracts on their
own and said he felt that food expenses informational meetings may be okay. He
said it was the high number of the expenses on the expense report in question that
caught his eye. He said other reports have minor corrections and he was not
singling out one person.
Director Deadwyler said that former Directors have expensed meals at costly
establishments. She said she as glad that Director Walker was looking at the
expensive. She said that in the past a political group wanted to acknowledge her
and others as recipients of a community award. She said that Directors should
consider the purpose of an activity.

General Manager Genova said that RTD is by far the big person in the room.

6.G

Director Walker said he had infrequently seen expensive meals in the past but the
report in question contained a particularly large meal expense, which also caught
his eye.

Director Walker said that the justification was not descriptive enough and that he
told the Director to revise his expense report or find someone else to sign it. He
noted the Director removed that large meal expense and one other item as well. He
said he felt the meal expense to be substantial enough to bring to the Chair’s
attention, and the Chair wanted to discuss the expense in front of the Executive
Committee.
Director Deadwyler asked whether there is a limit for an expense to be reasonable.
Ms. McManus responded that she reviews all expenses that come into the Board
Office and reviews the reports with Directors as necessary. She said that, if they
insist an expense was a proper business expense, she does not argue with them
but refers any really extraordinary items to the Chair.
Director Walker said he did not want the expense report in question to be a
reflection on staff, because they did their job, but stated he has the ability to go
beyond. He said he would sign the report in question it if the executive committee
agrees.
Chair Hoy said that it is the prerogative of the Chair to bring expense reports to the
Executive Committee so the members can discuss them and set the tone and pace
for Directors. He said there is a lot of gray in expense reports and applauded
Director Walker for finding the demarcation line. He said one of the purposes of
bring the matter before the committee was to let the other members of the Board
knows they are looking. He said each Director feels what is appropriate. He said the
Directors have a limit on travel and local expenses and asked how closely to watch
individual expenses.
Director Deadwyler said the Chair approves changes in policy and that the next
Chair could set a different policy. She said unless firm limits were established, the
committee should leave expenses alone and question exceptions as they come.
Chair Hoy said it is difficult to find guidance and for Directors to let their
conscience be their guide.

Chair Hoy said he wondered about the purpose of that expense.

6.G

Ms. McManus said that the Board Office transfers funds between each Director’s
travel and local expense budgets and that IT expenses cannot be commingled.
Director Walker said that he had exceeded his travel due to his involvement with
the American Public Transportation Association (APTA) and would need to transfer
funds from his local account.

Ms. McManus said that any travel beyond the first two sanctioned trips must first
be approved by the Chair.
Chair Hoy asked whether he would be asked to approve of transfers for someone
who runs out of local funds early in the year or whether that transfer is automatic.
Ms. McManus said that, based on the Director needs, the Board Office would make
the transfer automatically. She said that the transfer is done automatically at the
end of the year and that she would soon be sending out an email stating that. She
noted that the Board Office has always had difficulty getting expenses in without
rolling over to the next year. She said all annual expenses in arrears should be
turned in by November so that only expenses occurring in December would be
processed in December, which allows the end-of-year budget process be clean.
Director Walker noted that travel expense moneys transfer to the local account
automatically but not from local to travel.
Ms. McManus said that Directors cannot travel without prior permission.
Director Deadwyler noted one previous trip when a former Chair used discretionary
funds to pay for Directors who had exhausted their expense accounts.
Director Walker noted that Directors are restricted from traveling in the last three
months of their terms if they are not up for re-election.
Director Menten said she agreed with the limits in place and that one of the
advantages of being Chair is the ability to keep an eye on Directors’ expenses. She
asked Director Walker if he would sign the report in question.
Director Walker said he was hesitant to sign.

Packet Pg. 82

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jul 20, 2017 12:00 PM (Committee Reports)

Chair Hoy asked whether such transfers were merely clerical or if he would need to
approve them.

6.G

Chair Hoy asked how much control the committee has over high dollar expenses.

Director Francone said that the Directors are elected officials who need common
sense to understand what is right and wrong, because they are responsible for
taxpayer dollars. Having said that, she said there are legitimate purposes and
reasons for entertaining constituents or business leaders to further the business of
RTD. She said there is a difference between a high dollar meal and an inexpensive
one and that there may be a reason to take someone to the expensive one. She
said the purpose of expense should be within reason.
Chair Hoy summarized that he and the Executive Committee are in agreement and
that there will be times to make exceptions. He said he does not want to redefine
expenses because they are not defined for a reason. He said that the Board is on
the same wavelength.
Director Francone said she did not have an opinion because she did not know the
nature or purpose of the expenses in question.
Chair Hoy reiterated he did not intend to ask the committee to approve the expense
but rather wanted to gather the member’s thoughts. He said the report in question
has been vetted and, though the total of the expenses is large, there is no reason to
challenge individual expenses on the report. He said that the expenses can be
justified individually.
Director Francone said she appreciated the explanation but did not know how
beneficial this discussion has been without further detail.
Director Walker said the typical reason to bring such an item to a larger body is to
ask questions of others about the submitter. He said that a person experiencing
financial problems, for example, could ramp up their expenses.
Director Deadwyler said that, unless a dollar limit is established, the committee
needed to leave the expenses alone.
Director Walker said that, if no one has concern, he would approve the expense.
Chair Hoy said that the matter of the discussion would not be secret in two weeks’
time.

Director Menten said there are reasonable expenses and the Board should not
blindly accept expenses. She said the public would want to see the expenses and,
in the case of partisan politics, there are definite rules.

6.G

Director Deadwyler said that the discussion would make others aware that
expenses would be questioned in the future.

attendance: John Davis, Brian Harpole, Jerome Hernandez, and Oscar Lee.
Bruce Abel, Chief Operating Officer/Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations said that
this is indeed the best part of every meeting when staff and the Board can recognize the
people that have contributed so much to the organization.
Mr. Abel noted that John Davis was retiring after 39 years of service. He said that Mr.
Davis started at RTD on the shop floor as a mechanic, and for a number of years, he was
the budget analyst for the Bus Ops group. He noted that Mr. Davis’ hobbies were classic
cars and motorcycles, and he shared that passion with many people. Mr. Abel added that
Mr. Davis has two children, six grandchildren, and he will definitely be missed.

John Davis commented that he had been at RTD a long time, and he started out at the
Platte garage. He remarked that the Boulder garage was being operated out of an old Ford
dealership, and the heartbeat of RTD was the old Alameda facility. He said that that place
really made everyone felt like a team, and having everyone in that little two story building
made a huge difference. He noted that there was a manager who came from Chicago
transit whose management style was managing by walking around, which lets a manager
know what is really going on and he incorporated that philosophy into his own work. He
thanked everyone at RTD that he had worked with and stated that he never felt like he
worked for anyone, but he worked with everyone. He said thank you, and it had been a
fun ride.
Mr. Abel said that Brian Harpole was retiring after 19 years of service. He remarked that
Mr. Harpole began as a repair mechanic and his plans are to visit Delaware and New
Jersey to finish seeing all 50 states. He added that in retirement Mr. Harpole will do
housework and help his friends and neighbors with their projects.
Mr. Harpole thanked RTD for the ability to work with such a great organization and
fantastic talent.
Mr. Abel commented that Jerome Hernandez was retiring after 23 years of service. He
stated that currently, Mr. Hernandez was a driver out of the Platte division, and he had
been an operator for his entire career at RTD.
Jerome Hernandez stated that being a bus driver was very interesting. He said that the
first five years was on-the-job training, and it took him a few years to get to know the
people riding the bus. He added that it took time to get familiar with driving and handling
people, but when he looks back it was fun and he was happy that he became a bus driver.
He thanked everyone again for the opportunity.
Mr. Abel stated that the last retiree present was Oscar Lee, who was retiring after 34
years of service. He noted that Mr. Lee was an operator and instructor out of the Platte
garage. He said that Mr. Lee’s plans for retirement will include travelling and thanked him
for his years of service.
Oscar Lee said that working for RTD was challenging, but the rewards were fantastic. He
stated that he had built a relationship with his passengers, and as things progressed he
changed his personality to be happy. He added that he was going to miss driving and the
realization that he will never dive a bus again hit him harder than he had expected. He
asked if management could make is possible for him to drive a bus now and again, but he

Chair Hoy thanked the other retirees, M. Charles Armstrong, Robert Medina, and Alice
Osner for their years of service since they were unable to attend the Board Meeting.
Special Recognition – APTA 2017 International Bus & Paratransit Roadeo
Bus International Participant
John Deschner (RTD – 8th Place)
Chair Hoy noted that John Deschner was unable to attend the May Board meeting where
the other APTA Bus & Paratransit Roadeo winners were recognized, so he would be
recognized at this meeting.
Mr. Abel commented that Mr. Deschner was working during May’s Board meeting, so he
was unable to accept his plaque. He stated that Mr. Deschner took 8th place out of 60
nationally and he has won the RTD competition a number of times over the past couple of
years as well.
John Deschner stated that his father, who also worked for RTD, always told him to treat
passengers like they were family and friends. He said that he would be at RTD for a few
more years, and he thanked the Board for acknowledging him.

V.

Public Participation
Chair Hoy stated public participation was open to anyone who wanted to address the
Board. He reminded the audience that each speaker is allowed three minutes.
John Torres, Boulder, stated that he was the Executive Director for the Golden West
retirement home that houses 400 seniors. He noted that he was in attendance to speak
about the Route 209/209G, which comes before the Board every few years for
elimination. He remarked that, while the usage is low, the severity of the cut would be
high. He noted that the community currently uses VIA Mobility and Access-a-Ride, but
the down side of those services is that they must be scheduled in advance. He added that
the community chose to support VIA Mobility because it cannot afford to purchase its
own bus for transportation and asked the Board to reconsider cutting off that line.
Dan Burke, Centennial, commented that he was the President of the National Federation of
the Blind in Denver. He noted that there were a lot of people in the audience because of
the new electric 16th Street Mallride buses. He remarked that since the buses were quiet,
they were a safety concern for the blind. He added that a pedestrian safety bill requires
electric vehicles to make sounds so that blind people can distinguish them. He noted that

Packet Pg. 88

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2017 5:30 PM (Approval of Board Meeting Minutes of June 27, 2017)

noted that he and his wife were leaving for Vietnam the next day so he and his wife could
not rest just yet.

8.A

Joe Triplett, Aurora, remarked that he was a Board member for the National Federation of
the Blind. He noted that he was downtown earlier in the day and was unable to hear the
new shuttle bus. He asked staff for a timeline of when the audible devices would be
installed on the bus motors and added that shuttle drivers are not ringing the bells like they
should. He further added that the older buses were not ringing their bells either.
Steve Patton, Centennial, also expressed his concerns with the new electric shuttle buses.
He stated that he is a travel instructor with the Colorado Center for the Blind and his
students use alternative techniques for everyday life. He explained that having a very
large vehicle such as a shuttle bus with no sounds is very frightening and disturbing and
stated that it makes him feel unsafe and that he cannot do his job. He added that he too
would like a timeline for the installation of the noise devices and added that it would be a
great marketing tool for the School of the Blind.
Bruce Abel, Acting Chief Operations Officer and Assistant General Manager of Bus
Operations, stated that given the commentary he wanted to address the Board by saying
that the mall shuttles will be updated with the noisemakers by the end of July. He added
that staff has issued several bulletins to the driving corps regarding ringing bells and also
the need to ring bells at street corners so that individuals with vision impairments can
know that buses are at corners. He added that the concerns articulated will also be
addressed with the driving corps.
Monique Melton, Englewood, stated that she was the President of the Mile High Chapter
of the National Federation of the Blind. She commented that not only are the mall shuttles
a hazard, but the light rail trains are becoming a hazard, too. She remarked that recently
there have been two incidents at the Englewood Station where the northbound train did
not ring its bell. She asked that light rail operators ring their bells as they pull into and
leave a station.
Peter Chan, Woodland, CA, indicated that he was a student of the Colorado Center for the
Blind. He commented that out of the six training centers in the United States, he chose
the Colorado Center for the Blind because it has the best facilities. He said that in
Sacramento the transit agency has audio and visual signs for pedestrians, as well as a loud
PA system for everyone to hear. He encouraged the Board to implement these tools.

Packet Pg. 89

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2017 5:30 PM (Approval of Board Meeting Minutes of June 27, 2017)

while the regulation does not take effect for two years, it is important that the new 16th
Street Mallride busses are safe for the blind community. He further added that one person
in the audience was hit by one of the new buses and reported the incident but they have
yet to hear back from RTD staff.

Gary Van Dorn, Denver, also spoke about the quiet shuttles. He said that he used the
Mallride to get to the Board meeting and the driver did not ring the bells. He added that he
had a video that he would like to share with staff and the General Manager and that he
would take videos throughout the week to document the improvement. He added that he
recognized RTD’s need for a new mall shuttle fleet, but he thought that staff would have
delayed putting them into service until the noisemakers had been installed.
Jamie Perkins, Denver, stated that she was the Program Manager with Transit Alliance.
She explained that Transit Alliance was a nonprofit organization with a 20-year history of
partnering with RTD and advancing public transportation in the metro region. On behalf of
Transit Alliance, she was addressing the Board to provide comments of support for
improvements coming to the Broadway and Lincoln Corridor. She added that Transit
Alliance firmly believes that the future of transportation in this region will be major
investments and improvements to RTD’s bus network. While you might think that
Broadway and Lincoln are a Denver-specific project, we see huge benefits for the entire
RTD district. Like much of the metro region, Broadway is changing. RTD and the City &
County of Denver are wise to get ahead of the curve by ensuring that more people will be
able to travel to and through this corridor. Providing even better bus service on Broadway
and Lincoln will leverage the transit-oriented development happening at Broadway and
Alameda Stations, while helping to connect existing neighborhoods and businesses. The
cooperation and collaboration between RTD and the City sets an example region wide.
Transit Alliance strongly believes that the future of transit in this region is providing
exemplary bus service that is frequent, reliable, and serves all district residents. This is
possible only with the cooperation of municipalities to develop smart land use policies that
prioritize transit riders. Most importantly, these are improvements that elevate the
importance of transit service for all people, not just those people commuting in and out of
Denver during peak hours. Transit Alliance envisions a future where transit is a first choice
for affordable living and not just for commuting.
We are leading a coalition of
organizations that support a “Better Broadway” and will activate our citizen leaders
throughout the district to support these efforts to better serve people who ride the bus.
Thank you for your leadership and dedication to all of the region, but especially for those
of us in the region that make the bus a top choice.
Helen Bushnell, Denver, said she wanted to comment on the proposed service changes.
She said that historically one of the stops closest to Civic Center has been the most used.
She added that the stop at Denver Health is a good option to eliminate, but when
removing a popular stop with others, it becomes difficult to evaluate what RTD is doing or
trying to accomplish. She stated that RTD needs to do a better job with outreach for both
the community and its drivers. In regards to the Route 209, she stated that there is a lack
of service for working-class people and the Route 206 used to provide that service. She
urged the Board to keep the Route 209 and to look at the populations not being served.

Charlie Busch, Denver, said she bought her house as close to a bus stop and light rail as
she could, while still living on a quiet street. She commented that her drivers are excellent
but noted that they need more outreach efforts. She remarked that the changes to the
Route 0 are needed but explained that ridership would not increase by moving the stop to
Exposition. She added that people will use transit if they have a way to get to their
destinations safely, and she asked the Board to consider people when making service
changes.

Subject:

Construction Award for IFB 37-DH 001.
Customer Care Call Center and Treasury Repair
Facility.

General

Board Meeting Date: July 25, 2017

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to award a contract to AD Miller Services in the amount
not-to-exceed of $5,627,730 for the New Customer Care Call Center and Treasury Repair Facility
project. Funding for this contract is included in the 2017 Amended Budget. It is further recommended
that the General Manager or his designee be authorized to issue contract amendments in the total
amount not-to-exceed the remaining approved project budget of $845,393 as needed.
BACKGROUND
The Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) operating facility at 711 W. 31st Avenue in Denver was
acquired by FasTracks in 2010 for the construction of the Electrified Segment of Northwest Rail. A
section of the building was in the path of the commuter rail flyover bridge for the corridor. The building
originally had four bays and an additional office/crew rooms section. The eastern bay was removed
along with the offices/crew rooms to accommodate the flyover. The building was originally built in the
1940’s by the Rocky Mountain Motor Company which maintained and stored buses. After that, it was
acquired by the BNSF and used as an operating facility and repair shop.
With the growing demand for space across RTD’s operating facilities, a facilities space planning study
was conducted. Based on location, size, and access to the DUS Transit Hub, it was recommended to
relocated the Customer Care Call Center and the Treasury facility to this location. Both groups needed
additional space for their operations. Also, this freed up additional space for the Bus Operations Group at
District Shops.
Additional requirements/space for the Customer Care Division, Treasury Division and Bus Operations has
been a direct impact from RTD’s FasTracks expansion.
DISCUSSION
The three bays total approximately 45,000 square feet. Customer Care will take the eastern most bay.
Their space will be made up of offices and the telephone information call center. This will allow for
current space requirements and future expansion. The Treasury will be in the center bay. Their space will

Enter into a Contract with RouteMatch for
MDT and On-Board Software for Access-a-Ride

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to award a contract
for computerized Mobile Data Terminals (MDTs) and onboard software with RouteMatch Software, Inc.
(RouteMatch) (Contract Number 17DH025) for an amount not to exceed $1,800,000. The price
includes MDTs, software, implementation and three years of extended support.
BACKGROUND
RTD’s Access-a-Ride paratransit service provides transportation in the Denver metro area for people
whose disabilities prevent them from using lift-equipped fixed-route bus service. Access-a-Ride service
uses vehicles equipped with RouteMatch software and iPilot 8000 computerized Mobile Data Terminals
(MDTs) and associated onboard equipment that enables dispatching and communications via the
RouteMatch paratransit scheduling and central dispatch software (‘RouteMatch central software’). The
current MDTs entered service in 2009 and reached end of useful life several years ago. The current
MDT’s have very high failure rates and are hard to procure. Consequently, it is imperative that the MDTs
be replaced with modern equipment in order to provide Access-a-Ride drivers with the necessary tools to
provide this important service.
DISCUSSION
RTD currently utilizes paratransit scheduling software produced by “RouteMatch.” It is necessary that
the on-board software loaded on the MDT’s integrate with the backend RouteMatch software in order to
allow Access-a-ride drivers to receive accurate information to perform their duties. Onboard software
that integrates with the RouteMatch central software is already developed.
RTD conducted an evaluation of the various options to replace the existing Access-a-Ride Mobile Data
Terminals. The option with the quickest deployment, least risk and lowest cost is to have RouteMatch
deploy new modern versions of the computerized MDTs with onboard software. Requiring RouteMatch
to provide the updated hardware and software, perform the integration and thus provide the complete
solution to modernize the Access-a-Ride MDT’s will speed the process by providing fewer procurements
and result in a single point of contact for RTD to have one vendor responsible for all of the functionality
associated with the upgrade of the Access-a-Ride MDT’s.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for this project is included in the adopted RTD budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute a contract with RouteMatch to provide
computerized MDTs and onboard software. This is the recommended alternative.

Packet Pg. 106

11.B

2. Continue to t r y t o provide remedial repairs to extend the system life. This is not a sustainable
option and does not provide the upgrades necessary for Access-a-Ride drivers to perform their duties.
This is not recommended.
3. Proceed with an entirely new procurement for a new paratransit scheduling software package and
integrated MDT’s. This would take well over a year to procure and deploy the chosen system and is
not budgeted. This is not recommended.

Enter into a Contract with INIT for Automatic
Passenger Counters for Light Rail Vehicles

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to award a contract
for purchase, installation and maintenance of Automatic Passenger Counters (APCs) with INIT
Innovations in Transportation, Inc. (INIT) (Contract Number 17DH026) for an amount not to exceed
$2,400,000 and transfer up to $950,000 from project 10444 (Mobile Data Terminals) to project 10345
(New Automatic Passenger Counter).
BACKGROUND
RTD uses APC’s on light rail vehicles to monitor on-time performance and to gather ridership
information. The data collected by the APCs is ingested into the INIT Computer Aided Dispatch/
Automatic Vehicle Location (CAD/AVL) system for compilation, presentation, and analysis of ridership
numbers and on-time performance calculations. This data is key for required federal reporting,
operational considerations and planning. Currently, only 42 of the 201 vehicle LRV fleet (24%) are
equipped with APC’s making it very difficult to provide statistically valid information.
DISCUSSION
RTD recently purchased hardware for the Access-a-Ride Mobile Data Terminal (MDT) Replacement
project. Staff subsequently determined that the equipment could be better utilized on the LRV fleet to
expand the number of APC equipped light rail cars to help with passenger count and on-time
performance measurement. A less expensive alternative for the Access-a-Ride MDT Replacement Project
has been identified and pursued, freeing up some funds that can be transferred to purchase additional
APCs for light rail.
RTD currently has an authorized and budgeted project (Project 10345 -New Auto Passenger Counters) to
begin to upgrade and expand the number of APC’s on the LRV fleet. Utilizing some of the hardware that
had already been purchased for the Access-a-Ride MDT project and transferring the remaining funds
from the MDT project will allow RTD to expand the scope of the currently budgeted LRV APC project
and further increase the number of Light Rail Vehicles that can be equipped with new APC equipment.
By using some of this equipment and transferring these additional funds, the APC coverage on the LRV
fleet can be increased to over 70%. This will allow for easier and more timely compilation of
statistically valid data for monitoring on-time performance and for gathering ridership data for internal
and external reporting. This equipment will be upgraded for both reliability and for security of data
transmissions over Wi-Fi. This will be a sole source contract to INIT in order to expand the number of
APC equipped light rail vehicles with technology similar to and compatible with the technology that is
utilized on the existing LRV fleet.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for this project (Project 10345- New Automatic Passenger Counters) is included in the adopted RTD
budget. The transfer of up to $950,000 from project 10444- Mobile Data Terminals, also included in the
adopted RTD budget, to project 10345 will fund the requested expansion of this effort.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to award a
contract for purchase, installation and maintenance of Automatic Passenger Counters (APCs) with INIT
Innovations in Transportation, Inc. (INIT) (Contract Number 17DH026) for an amount not to exceed
$2,400,000 and transfer up to $950,000 from project 10444 (Mobile Data Terminals) to project 10345
(New Automatic Passenger Counter). This is the recommended alternative.
2. Continue to try to utilize existing resources and provide minimal expansion and upgrade to the
existing APC’s. This does not leverage the existing hardware purchase and minimizes improvements in
data collection and service monitoring and is not the recommended alternative.

Resolution to Approve Refinancing for Interest
Savings

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: July 13, 2017
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: July 25, 2017

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Resolution”), authorizing the execution and delivery by
the RTD of a lease purchase agreement and related documents in connection with the partial refinancing
of the 2010A and 2015A Certificates of Participation.
In 2010, RTD issued its Series 2010A certificates of participation (COPs) to finance 55 new Siemens
light rail vehicles, 95 access-a-Ride vehicles, 32 Call-n-Ride vehicles, fare boxes and CAD/AVL
equipment. The 2010A COPs also refinanced the 1998A and 2001A COPs for interest expense savings.
The 2010A COPs were originally issued in the amount of $312, 900,000. The COPs are callable at par
on November 1, 2020 and final payment is scheduled to occur in 2040 and the interest rate being paid
ranges from 5.0% - 5.5%.
In 2015, RTD issued its Series 2015A certificates of participation (COPs) to finance 29 new Siemens
light rail vehicles, 179 40’ transit buses, 18 60’ articulated buses, and 7 mall shuttle buses. The 2015A
COPs were originally issued in the amount of $193,915,000. The COPs are partially ($65,000,000)
callable at par on June 1, 2020 and partially ($258,915,000) callable at par on June 1, 2025. Final
payment is scheduled to occur in 2040 and the interest rate being paid ranges from 3.25% - 5.0%.
The approaching call dates and current low interest rate environment have created an opportunity to
refinance portions of the 2010A and 2015A COPs to realize a reduction in interest expense while
keeping the 2020 call date.
DISCUSSION:
RTD has the potential to advance-refund a portion of remaining outstanding Series 2010A and 2015A
COPs to realize, subject to market movement, a savings of approximately $13.6 million (4.35% of
principal of refunded COPs) between 2018 and 2025. RTD Board Policy and the Resolution require a
minimum of 3% savings which allows some flexibility in regards to changes in interest rates between
now and the date the new interest rate is locked.
While the potential refunding savings are significant, it is important to note that such savings are net of
a cost resulting from (a) the inability to invest proceeds of the new financing at a return equal to the
interest expense of the new financing, and (b) the length of time between the execution of the new
financing and the November 1, 2020 and June 1, 2020 call dates of the 2010A and 2015A COPs

Packet Pg. 110

11.D

(negative arbitrage). Absent a change in interest rates, the savings to RTD improves with the passage
of time, due to a reduction in time proceeds of the new financing must be invested prior to redeeming
the 2010A and 2015A COPs. Despite the cost associated with the negative arbitrage, the potential
savings from a refunding of the 2010A and 2015A COPs exceeds the typical threshold for a refunding
by RTD. Consequently, staff has assembled a financing team and commenced documentation to be in a
position to take advantage of the opportunity for RTD to reduce its interest expense.
RTD typically uses COPs to finance vehicles when the budget cannot accommodate the use of cash to
acquire the necessary vehicles, as was the case in 2010 and 2015. In this case, staff received an
attractive proposal from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. who is in the pre-selected investment bank pool for
the use of lease financing to refinance the Series 2010A and 2015A Certificates of Participation. As a
response to this proposal, staff engaged RTD’s financial advisor to determine if the proposal was a
better value to RTD than issuing certificates of participation. It was determined that the JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. proposal offered the most value to RTD.
Benefits of the JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. proposal include interest rates competitive with a COP
refinancing of the 2010A and 2015A COPs, the ability to keep the call option for RTD in 2020 as is
currently the case with the 2015A COPs and the ability to avoid the cost of obtaining credit ratings.
The Board is being requested through the Resolution to authorize the partial refinancing of the Series
2010A and 2015A COPs through an annually appropriated capital lease through JP Morgan Chase Bank
N.A.
Drafts of documents including the Lease Purchase Agreement, Escrow Agreement, Purchase and
Assignment Agreement are available for review in the Board Office.
RTD is receiving the advice of First Southwest Company as independent financial advisors and Butler
Snow LLP as Bond Counsel, in regard to the transaction. The lender in this transaction will be JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Costs associated with the refunding are considered “costs of issuance” and will be funded out of
proceeds. These costs include financial advisory, attorney and miscellaneous costs. The final payment
year of the new financing will not exceed 2025, the final payment year of the existing Series 2010A and
2015A COPs that are being refinanced.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the execution of documents, including the attached Resolution No.__, Series of 2017,
authorizing the execution and delivery by the RTD of a lease purchase agreement and related
documents in connection with the refinancing of the 2010A and 2015A certificates of
participation. This is the recommended action.
2. Do not authorize the execution of documents; including the attached Resolution No.__, Series of
2017 authorizing the execution and delivery by the RTD of a lease purchase agreement and
related documents in connection with the refinancing of the 2010A and 2015A certificates of
participation. This is not the recommended action as it would not take advantage of the interest
expense savings currently available to the district.

Approval of General Manager's 2018 Goals

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee that the
Board of Directors approves the General Manager’s goals for 2018 as defined in the attached General
Manager’s Performance Evaluation document.
BACKGROUND
The General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee works with the General
Manager to enhance its oversight responsibilities for the General Manager’s performance and to develop
processes that are approved by the full Board and are transparent to the public.
On July 20, 2010, the Board formalized and approved the goal setting process for the General Manager.
That process defines the steps the Board will follow in establishing the annual goals for the General
Manager. Beginning in 2011, these goals include core and task goals. Core goals are based on the
General Manager’s job description and are generally considered part of the ongoing responsibilities of the
General Manager. The task goals are a compilation of the priorities from the annual Joint Board and Staff
Advance Planning Session that occurs in the first quarter of the year.
One of the steps in the process is to formalize the General Manager’s annual goals utilizing the RTD
employee performance evaluation form consistent to all salaried RTD employees. This action item is to
formalize that process.
The General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee Chair and the full committee
have reviewed the 2018 core and task goals with the General Manager and approved the goals as
amended at the July 18, 2017 committee meeting to move to the full Board for approval.
DISCUSSION
Please refer to the attached General Manager Performance Evaluation form which identifies the five core
goals for 2018 and the three task goals for 2018. The attached General Manager Tactical Plan for 2018
is submitted as a supplement to this document.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
No financial impact in approving the 2018 Goals.

ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept this recommended action for approval of the General Manager’s 2018 goals. This
approval completes the formalized process as approved by the Board members for goal setting.
2. Do not accept this recommended action. Work with the General Manager Oversight and
Performance Management Committee and the General Manager to amend the 2018 goals. This
will significantly delay the schedule established for the approval of the goals.
3. Do nothing. Accept the risk and consequences of not complying with the State Auditor’s
recommendation for a clear, documented and timely process.
