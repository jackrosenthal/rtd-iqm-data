BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Customer-Facing Signage and Schedule Information

May 15, 2024

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Stuart Summers, Chief Communications and Engagement Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
DISCUSSION
RTD utilizes a combination of static and digital signs to provide customers with regulatory, safety, and
service-related information. RTD’s customer-facing signage displays a combination of service schedules,
disruptions, fare information and discounts, wayfinding, agency promotions, and accessibility and safetyrelated content. RTD has recently undertaken a number of projects to enhance its customer-facing
signage and make much-needed updates to improve the accuracy of information displayed.
The agency has four primary goals for customer-facing signage: (1) Wayfinding and Navigation, (2)
Service Information, (3) Personal Safety and Security, and (4) Promotions and Marketing. These goals
directly align with RTD’s Strategic Priorities of Customer Excellence and Community Value, as well as
the agency’s Strategic Initiative to create a Welcoming Transit Environment.
Static Signs
RTD has thousands of fixed signs across its entire system to identify rail stations and bus stops, provide
wayfinding directions, communicate accessibility options, and share safety and Customer Code of
Conduct guidelines. Agency staff are responsible for creating and maintaining all static signs at RTD
stops, stations, and facilities.
Shelter Boards
RTD’s system has approximately 1,050 shelter boards installed at all rail stations and select bus stops
and park-n-rides. The shelter boards are updated three times each year as part of RTD’s service changes.
Shelter boards display service schedules and system maps, communicate fares and discount programs,
provide language-access information, and include contact information for the Customer Care and Civil
Rights divisions and the Transit Police Department. Staff are responsible for creating, printing, and
placing the content in shelter boards.
Digital Signs
RTD’s public information system uses three types of digital signs to communicate information to
customers. The first category is Variable Message Signs (VMS), which display one to three lines of text.
VMS are original to RTD’s rail system and primarily installed at light rail and commuter rail platforms.

Packet Pg. 3

1.E.1

The second category of digital signs is public information displays (PIDs). PIDs are the screens installed
at RTD’s transit centers and facilities, as well as select bus stops. RTD has approximately 130 PIDs
across its system to display schedule information and other must-know content. The third category of
digital signs is universal advertising totems (UAT). UATs refer to the large, freestanding, walk-up screens
recently installed at light rail and commuter rail platforms. The first UAT was installed on March 9,
2023, and by the end of 2024, 130 total UATs will be in operation. All costs associated with installing,
operating, and maintaining the UATs rest with RTD’s advertising contractor as part of a 10-year
agreement with the agency. The agency maintains a 50% share-of-voice for content on UATs, meaning
half of the screentime is reserved for agency information and promotions. The share-of-voice is achieved
through 10-second rotations that alternate between schedules and promotions.
Improvement Projects Underway
Many of RTD’s variable message signs are beyond their expected useful life of 10 to 15 years, and the
signs are often out of service. Sourcing replacement parts to make the necessary repairs is difficult. In
March 2024, RTD received the first shipment of 30 new VMS to begin a process to replace all nonworking signs. RTD has prioritized installing the new signs along light rail lines impacted by the
upcoming summer maintenance projects. Additional digital signs have been ordered, and staff estimates
that all non-working VMS across the entire system will be replaced in the next six to 12 months.
In October 2023, RTD implemented a software upgrade to display service alerts on VMS. Additionally,
VMS currently show predicted departure times on light rail through the use of track sensors. Predicted
times are less reliable and will revert to scheduled times as a backup option. A project is underway to
install global positioning system (GPS) components on all rail vehicles, with a goal of incorporating realtime information in summer 2024. The same real-time feed will also display on UATs and in RTD’s trip
planner application.
Stations and Stops Assessments
RTD has three different station and stop assessments currently underway to establish a comprehensive
set of data, review existing customer amenities, and identify opportunities for potential improvement. In
March 2024, staff launched a light rail station review process to assess the agency’s 25 light rail
stations with the highest customer boardings. Following the review’s initial phase, staff will conduct a
similar assessment at all remaining light rail stations. Additionally, with consultant support, staff will
assess wayfinding signage at Denver Union Station. This project is an update to an assessment
conducted in 2016 and will align with future infrastructure enhancements. An active solicitation is
underway for the agency’s Bus Stop Infrastructure Accessibility Assessment. The assessment will
review the approximately 9,750 active and inactive bus stops in RTD’s service area and establish a
comprehensive data set.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
“Group 33” Fixed-Route Service Contract

May 15, 2024

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Fred Worthen, Assistant General Manager, Bus Operations
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
DISCUSSION
Pursuant to § 32-9-119.5 (2)(a), C.R.S., RTD operates a system under which up to 58% of the agency’s
vehicular service is provided by qualified private businesses, nonprofit organizations, or local
governments pursuant to competitively negotiated contracts. The agency currently contracts
approximately 45% of fixed-route service, 100% of complementary paratransit service (Access-a-Ride),
and 100% of FlexRide service, for a total amount of contracted transit service of approximately 56%.
The first contract for the provision of contracted fixed-route services was referred to as the “Group 1”
contract, and each subsequent contract was given a higher number. The service contract referred to as
“Group 33” replaces the Group 29 service contract.
The last option year of the current Group 29 service contract is set to expire January 11, 2025. A
Request for Proposals (RFP) to replace this service package was issued February 5, 2024, with
proposals due March 18, 2024, to allow adequate time for a comprehensive procurement process. The
term for the Group 33 contract will be for three years, with two one-year options, for a total of five
years.
The service package consists of 109 buses providing approximately 284,861 revenue hours per year.
The routes provide service to the cities of Arvada, Aurora, Brighton, Commerce City, Englewood,
Glendale, Highlands Ranch, Lakewood, Littleton, Lone Tree, Parker, Thornton, Westminster, and Wheat
Ridge, the City and County of Broomfield, and the City and County of Denver.
Based on the recommendation of the evaluation panel, during the June 2024 meeting cycle, staff will
bring for the Board’s consideration a recommended action to enter into a contract for the provision of
Group 33 fixed-route services in support of the agency Strategic Priorities of Community Value and
Financial Success.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
September 2024 Service Changes

May 15, 2024

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Fred Worthen, Assistant General Manager, Bus Operations
Jessie Carter, Senior Manager, Service Development
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 minutes
BACKGROUND
In alignment with the service change and work shift selection process detailed in the Collective
Bargaining Agreement (CBA) between RTD and the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1001 (ATU), the
September 2024 Service Change proposal facilitates both an opportunity for RTD bus and rail operators
to select new assignments and for Service Development staff to adjust the operations plan for RTD’s
transit network.
Many service change recommendations proposed for September 2024 restore rail service levels and
patterns to the Central and Southeast Corridors, with the coping panel replacement project and Phase
One of the Downtown Rail Reconstruction Project anticipated to be completed. Changes made to bus
service to maintain access to the Central Business District are also contained herein.
DISCUSSION
These proposals include a mix of service improvements, reductions, and adjustments aimed at
addressing the system network reliability, increasing seasonal school-related capacity, and restoring
service to the Central and Southeast Corridors with the conclusion of current rail reconstruction efforts.
Notable recommendations include proposals that return service levels on the E and H Lines upon the
coping panel project’s completion and discontinue suspensions and detours on the Central Corridor. Rail
services on the D and H Lines are to resume the regular pattern on the Central Corridor’s Downtown
Loop, and L Line service, which was suspended with Phase One of the Downtown Rail Reconstruction
Project, is to be restored. Additionally, bus service on the Free MetroRide is to be discontinued as fiveminute service frequency returns on the Free MallRide. Finally, the removal of bus detours downtown
and the restoration of Central Corridor rail services enable Route 0 Limited midday service to be
discontinued.
Following RTD’s 2021-2026 Strategic Plan, relating directly to the strategic priority of Customer
Excellence, and recognizing the agency’s people power constraints, the proposals in the September
2024 Service Change are directed at improving on-time performance, maintaining compliance with
RTD’s CBA with ATU, and adjusting service levels to match summer ridership demand.

The Board-adopted guidance for proposed service changes continues to be:
• Service performance evaluation based on RTD Service Standards
• The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit-dependent markets
• The availability of alternative services to affected riders
• Cost-effective distribution throughout the district and family of services, and the ability to
enhance service when possible
• Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also there is no disparate impact on a minority population nor a disproportionate
burden on a low-income population
• Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
A summary of the service proposals, provided below, are detailed in Attachment A.
