BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
System Advertising Contract

Committee Meeting Date:
June 8, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
June 8, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO, or her authorized designee, to
execute all documents necessary to negotiate and enter into a contract with Lamar Transit for the
System Advertising Program agreement, in an amount not to exceed $63 million during the base tenyear term and a 70% revenue share to RTD above the minimum annual guarantee with two five-year
options.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Pauletta Tonilas, AGM, Communications
Adrian Mabry, Manager, Projects & Contracts, Communications
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD has an on-vehicle advertising program to generate advertising revenue for the agency. On-vehicle
advertising includes bus and rail exterior and interior ads. RTD has received between $3.1 million to
$3.4 million in a minimum annual guarantee (MAG) of revenue over the past several years. In addition to
the MAG, RTD receives a revenue share with the advertising vendor that pays RTD 60% of revenue over
and above the MAG.
In 2017, staff began discussing the opportunity to add digital displays to leverage the advertising
program to enhance the customer experience and generate additional revenue. Digital displays have the
ability to share real-time digital customer information and messages as well as advertising. Staff has
actively pursued an enhanced approach to system advertising that would include a digital advertising
solution. Those actions include:
•

2018 – RTD released a Request for Proposals (RFP) for digital advertising only. The RFP was
retracted in order for RTD to pursue a more enhanced and unified system advertising program.

•

2019 – Staff performed additional research on digital signage and digital advertising to inform a
combined System Advertising Program RFP.

•

March 2020 – RTD published a Request for Information (RFI) addressing several aspects of a future
digital advertising program. Responses received informed the System Advertising Program RFP.

•

November 2020 – RTD released the System Advertising Program RFP.

DISCUSSION
The System Advertising RFP is designed to enhance the existing on-vehicle advertising program to
include a digital advertising program as well. This approach has three main goals:

Packet Pg. 4

1.C.1

1. Enhance the customer experience by providing real-time, relevant customer information and
messages on digital displays at stations and major transfer centers and stops.
2. Unify RTD’s existing public information displays (PIDs) system with the new digital displays under
a single content management system (CMS).
3. Generate additional advertising revenue for RTD.
In February 2021, four proposals were received from Banner, Vector, Intersection, and Lamar. One
proposal (Banner) was declared non-responsive as it included simply a pricing sheet for vehicle wraps. A
cross-functional internal team evaluated the three remaining proposals, of which two were deemed
technically viable (Intersection and Lamar). The evaluation team conducted a comprehensive evaluation
of the two proposals which included several rounds of questions and presentations from the two
proposers.
The evaluation team unanimously recommends the selection of Lamar Transit. Taking into consideration
the technical aspects of the proposal along with the revenue proposal, Lamar emerged as the strongest
overall solution.
Lamar’s proposal emphasized over 20 years of on-vehicle advertising experience with RTD as well as
extensive knowledge of the Denver market. Lamar also presented a clearly defined plan for planning and
implementation of digital displays across the RTD system. In addition, Lamar proposed a clear plan for
how the contractor would integrate with RTD’s existing legacy system of digital displays under a new
content management system (CMS) and how the firm will handle service and maintenance on the legacy
displays as well as the new displays.
Lamar proposed 585 new screen deployments in the following combination of digital displays to
augment the customer experience and deliver digital advertising over the life of the agreement.
•

(450) 55” Outdoor LCD displays

•

(90) 75” Free-standing, interactive, double-sided LCD kiosks

•

(45) LED displays/walls

From L to R: Examples of LCD displays, interactive LCD kiosks, and LED walls
These digital deployments are scheduled to be installed in a phased approach.

Packet Pg. 5

1.C.1

In the first three years (2022, 2023 and 2024), 300 displays, 60 kiosks and 30 LED walls are scheduled
for deployment totaling 390 digital signs.
An additional 50 displays, 10 kiosks and 5 LED walls are scheduled for deployment in 2032, 2034 and
2037 respectively, bringing the overall total to 585 digital signs across RTD’s system.

For each digital deployment, Lamar will propose locations for displays, which RTD staff will review and
approve, deny or suggest alternative solutions for each installation on a case-by-case basis.
RTD will have space on the digital displays to share real-time customer information and messages on an
ongoing basis. This space is up to 10% of the digital display rotation available for RTD use
(approximately 2.4 hours/day).
RTD will retain up to 20% reserve space on all vehicle exteriors, 50% of bus interior cards and 25% rail
card interiors [transfluxes] for RTD’s exclusive messaging use.
RTD will also have up to four static billboards available for its own messaging for the entire term of the
agreement.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The proposed agreement is a 10-year base contract with two, five-year options. Revenue for the base
term of the contract will total $63 million. The revenue share percentage is 70% to RTD over and
beyond the MAG.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Government Relations Report

Committee Meeting Date:
June 8, 2021

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Davies, Government Relations Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 Minutes
BACKGROUND
The Regional Transportation District (RTD) has a Government Relations Program facilitated and overseen
by the agency’s Government Relations Officer. Part of the role of the Government Relations Officer is to
coordinate and develop strategic communications to advance the agency’s legislative priorities and serve
as a point of contact for elected officials in the Denver metro region.
DISCUSSION
Below are the notable Government Relations highlights at the federal, state and local levels since the last
Communications and Government Relations Committee meeting held on April 6, 2021. This report was
prepared on May 27, 2021 and will be updated verbally as needed during the Committee meeting.
Federal
Original bill sponsors Senator Hickenlooper, Senator Bennet, and Representative Perlmutter have
introduced the Railroad Rehabilitation and Innovative Financing Equity Act (RRIF Equity Act) - the standalone bill to ensure the return of RTD’s RRIF Credit Risk Premium. The RRIF Equity Act will accompany
the appropriation funding request as well. The legislation was also co-sponsored by Representative
DeGette, Crow, and Buck. RTD appreciates the support from its Congressional delegation on this
important matter.
Since the April Communications and Government Relations Committee, the Administration and Congress
have been working to find agreement on a long-term infrastructure package. Congressional leaders have
met with President Biden and White House staff. The meetings have resulted in a decrease in the size of
the President’s proposal from $2.25T to $1.7T. This compares to the Senate minority members’ offer of
$568B originally and was recently increased to $1T. Much of the disagreement remains on the scope of
what the package will cover – the definition of infrastructure.
In the meantime, Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee leaders introduced a bipartisan
five-year, $303B bill that covers spending and policy for highways and bridges. The Committee markedup this bill on May 26, 2021 and was passed unanimously. The other Senate Committees have not
signaled a mark-up of their sections of the bill – Banking Committee’s transit title and the Commerce
Committee’s Rail/Safety title. On the House side, Transportation and Infrastructure Committee
Chairman, Peter DeFazio, has not announced a mark-up of the House version of the surface

Packet Pg. 24

1.D.2

transportation bill, but it is expected that there will be a mark-up scheduled in early June. An initial
analysis of the Senate EPW proposal does highlight a shift to support transit related expenditures using
highway formula funding. For example, changes are made to the Congestion, Mitigation and Air Quality
Improvement Program (CMAQ) that support continuous operations funding for certain transit projects
including state-supported Amtrak passenger rail projects. Additionally, funding provided to Colorado
Department of Transportation (CDOT) through the Surface Transportation Block Grant Program and the
newly created Carbon Reduction Program are made eligible for capital expenses on Bus Rapid Transit
projects.
Government Relations is working to seek support for funding to complete the replacement of bus
maintenance pits located at the East Metro Division through the Federal Transit Administration’s Low
and No Emissions Grant Program. This project will help facilitate the operations of future battery-electric
buses currently in the procurement process.
State
On May 24, 2021, Governor Polis signed HB21-1186 – Regional Transportation District Operations. RTD
appreciates the work of the Accountability Committee to recommend the legislative provisions included
in HB 1186.
HB21-260 – Sustainability of the Transportation System – is the statewide transportation funding bill.
As of the writing of this report, the bill has passed the Senate and is being heard in the House Finance
Committee. As reported to the Board, the bill has seen a shift in funding to increase allocations to
multimodal and air quality improvement programs. Also reported to the Board is the inclusion of
language that allows for a Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) to create a new Regional
Transportation Authority (RTA). RTD would have the ability to comment on a new RTA being created
inside the boundaries of RTD and enter into an intergovernmental agreement to resolve operational
issues. Existing RTAs would be required to approve the creation of a new RTA inside the existing RTA’s
boundary and has a similar intergovernmental agreement process as RTD. Lastly, an amendment was
accepted in the House Finance Committee that allowed funding from the Clean Transit Enterprise to be
used on natural gas fleet replacement if battery electric option were not available or feasible.
SB21-238 – Create Front Range Passenger Rail District – continues to be considered by the General
Assembly. The bill has passed the Senate and is currently in the House. Several amendments have been
adopted. A notable amendment states that pending a National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) analysis,
the Rail District should prioritize the Northwest Corridor as the preferred alternative. Another amendment
states that a Board Director for the newly created District must be from an area where an unfinished
FasTracks project is located.
Lastly, Government Relations is closely tracking efforts by the Colorado Department of Public Health and
Environment, and the Air Quality Control Commission (AQCC). On May 20, 2021, the AQCC voted
unanimously to schedule a rulemaking on a widely reported proposal – the Employee Traffic Reduction
Program. The hearing to take next steps on approving the ETRP is expected in August.

Local
The focus for most Mayors and County Commissioners over the last two months has been on the
statewide transportation funding bill – SB21-260. Metro Mayors Caucus and the Metro Area County
Commissioners both supported SB21-260. Additionally, DRCOG’s Board also took a support position on
SB21-260.
Lastly, two Mayors from the region have resigned recently. Mayor Herb Atchison of Westminster
resigned on May 4, 2021 whose term was up after the November elections. Mayor Atchison was also
term limited. Additionally, Mayor Pat Quinn of Broomfield resigned effective May 23, 2021. Mayor
Quinn had stated that he would not run for re-election previously.
