#### 1. Denver Union Station Project Authority Update

Committee Chair James introduced Bill Mosher, Denver Union Station Project Authority.  Bill Mosher reviewed a Power Point presentation on Denver Union Station (DUS) that is available in the September 3, 2013 Planning and Development Committee Meeting Agenda Packet.  He stated that he had good news to report; the construction project is all moving along nicely.

Mr. Mosher walked everyone through the presentation showing the various stages and phases of construction.  He specifically commented on the Regional Bus Facility and the yellow tile, stating how reflective the tile is which provides great light.  Mr. Mosher commented that it does not feel like you are underground because of the great lighting.  Most of the remaining work is related to finish work.   Mr. Mosher was also really pleased to report on Kiewit’s project safety record, citing that Kiewit has been on this project for over 2 years without any significant on the job accidents.

Mr. Mosher finished his presentation and asked if there were any questions.

Director Folska thanked Mr. Mosher for a great presentation.  Director Folska asked if the Board could spend the night at the Grand Opening.  Bill Mosher said he’d be happy to arrange for a tour of the building along with a big party.

Director Rivera-Malpiede commented that the DUSPA project has been absolutely spectacular; it was amazing to be able to witness the project coming to life.  Director Rivera-Malpiede had just been at the train station on this past Monday.  She stated that it is really enjoyable commuting in and seeing how much work has been done.  Director Rivera-Malpiede mentioned that she walks around the DUS area regularly and sees many different people taking pictures of the project; people notice it is quite a historical moment and very exciting to watch.

Mr. Mosher offered congratulations to the Board because he stated that the Board are the ones that did all the preliminary work making it possible.  He stated that the DUS will become a signature of Downtown Denver in the same way that DIA has become a signature for the City of Denver.

Director Tobiassen agreed that congratulations are in order. He commended Mr. Mosher for providing a wonderful presentation. He commented that the progress on DUS is staggering.

Director Tobiassen stated that he did have a question from a constituent regarding the project regarding whether or not there would be a bike station located at DUS.   He also commented about the great team and how everyone is involved.  Director Tobiassen stated that everyone takes responsibility for DUS because ultimately, everyone has responsibility for the success of DUS. Mr. Mosher stated that the bike facility will be on the triangle parcel. That is on City land that had train tracks that needed to be removed.  Underneath the parcel there will be a parking garage and a plaza above.  We are paying for $1M for that plaza and Central Platte Valley Metro District will then be contributing to moving the bike facility along.  The design is fairly fixed.  Mr. Mosher committed to bring in new pictures with the next update.  The planned completion timeline is in the 2015-2016 time-frame.

Director Deadwyler commented that the picture of the public restroom fixture installation   caught her eye.   She asked how many public restrooms were in DUS.   Bill Mosher stated that he did not have the exact number Rick Clarke stated that staff presented those numbers about 6 months ago so he would get her the information.  She questioned how many stalls are in each restroom.   Director Deadwyler also wondered about wheel chair and scooter access.  She wants to know how high the counters are to make sure everyone has access.  Bill Mosher stated that he will get this information for the Board, and he extended an invite to Director Deadwyler to come for a visit of the facilities so she can see these areas first hand.

Director Daly commented that staff had received an email from the team with pictures from Jerry Nery, and the young lady that recently joined the team.   He stated they all climbed the ladder that was higher than DUS.  Director Daly noted that he didn’t see Mr. Mosher in the picture and wondered why.  Mr. Mosher stated that the picture was from the top of the cranes.  He shared that he has climbed before; he climbed a ladder for a project that was 37 stories high. He also shared that the ladders sway badly when they are up that high and that he doesn’t  need to climb a ladder again but agreed that the pictures are great.

Committee Chair James inquired about the status of the model train operations.  Bill Mosher commented that in anticipation of this meeting, he had talked with one of our people at Union Station Alliance (USA).  He said that one has been relocated and one is on hold.  USA has a public process that they are working through to find a new location.

#### 2. Olde Town Arvada TOD Update

Bill Van Meter stated that Bill Mosher and Bill Sirois would present an update on the Olde Town Arvada Transit Oriented Development (TOD).

Bill Sirois explained that RTD issued a Request for Proposal (RFP) and went through a formal selection process.  Trammell Crow was selected as the developer.  He said Bill Mosher will provide some background on the process and information about where we are at to date.

Bill Mosher stated that he really likes Olde Town Arvada.  Mr. Mosher commented that RTD, the Arvada Urban Renewal Authority and the City of Arvada worked very well together.  A third party was hired to prepare the Request for Quote (RFQ) and then the RFP was issued.  He advised that there were 10 responses.  Mr. Mosher shared that Trammell Crow went through the interview process and Trammell was selected.   He continued that the committee had only made their selection in July and that the project was moving very quickly since the selection.  Mr. Mosher stated that all the agencies really had their acts together; they had done their research well and knew what they wanted.

Bill Mosher reviewed how they had put a plan and a team together to create a healthy, vibrant project that would truly support the City of Arvada and Olde Town Arvada.  There are two options that Trammell Crow submitted.  The first option, Option A, is the base option that they do not intend to pursue.  It is a 9-acre site owned by the Arvada Urban Renewal Authority, RTD, or the City of Arvada.  This option created a 400 commuter car parking facility as a stand-alone facility with housing, hotel and retail being built in and around the development.  This option met the initial objectives, but one of the designers came up with an option that was not really what all the parties had asked for; however, Trammell Crow felt it was a strong option and submitted it for evaluation.  That was the option that was selected.

Mr. Mosher explained that Option B calls for making the parking facility larger.  The City of Arvada is looking to put 200 to 300 additional parking spaces in the facility for Olde Town; to do this the facility would come further south and the garage would go deeper.  He stated that the challenge with this option is that it costs more money.

Mr. Mosher stated that in either option the goal is to merge the Bus Facility with commuter parking while doing it in a way that maintains the view that the people desire.   Mr. Mosher feels that Trammell Crow have a viable plan and he stated that at a meeting a week ago Monday the Arvada Urban Renewal Authority and the City of Arvada approved the plan for a larger garage at this location.  Trammell Crow are looking at some retail and apartment projects they think they can move forward with fairly quickly. He stated that Trammell Crow would like to stage the opening similar to the grand opening of Denver Union Station where it coincides with the opening of the transit facility.

Director Tobiassen questioned if the properties will be owner-occupied or if they will be rentals.   Mr. Mosher stated that they have just proposed there be residential properties with the option to go either way.  He believes there are some great locations for condos but is concerned about building them in this environment; the current legislation in Colorado is not conducive to building Condos.  He stated that the good thing is that you can build fewer units to keep the properties smaller and more affordable. He said the goal is to have some home ownership in the area.

Director Tobiassen commented that Micro Residential is an interesting concept.  He also wonders if the plan is to decouple parking from housing.  Mr. Mosher shared that Trammell Crow did some research on the apartment market in Arvada, taking into account the Water Tower apartments which has larger units.  Trammell Crow is planning to build smaller units that are more affordable.  Micro housing around the world means 150 square feet; Trammell Crow is not interested in that definition, but is interested in somewhere between 350-750 square feet units.  Mr. Mosher stated that Trammell Crow does prefer to have parking associated with each of these projects but it will likely not be on a 1 to 1 ratio.  Another thing Trammell Crow are looking at is to have 3-5 zip/go cars onsite for people who don’t have cars.

Chair Anderson questioned if this action would take care of the parking needs of Olde Town Arvada. Mr. Mosher answered that the City of Arvada has been looking at a variety of potential parking sites.  Initially there was some concern about putting all the parking here, but as this plan has come together the idea is gaining popularity.

Chair Anderson stated that she is very excited to see this growth in Arvada, but stated that Trammell Crow cannot take the movie theatre.  This is the first movie theatre Arvada has had in 30 years.   Mr. Mosher feels that this plan actually compliments the movie theatre and should provide additional adjacent parking.

Chair Anderson is excited about the plan and about doing something with the hill the structure will be built against.  She feels this plan is a great way to achieve the goal of getting people into Olde Town.   She is very pleased with plan.  She thinks there is a lot of chatter going on out in the public that is indicative of people not really realizing how great this project is.  Chair Anderson wondered if this might become an issue in the future. Mr. Mosher stated that so far there has been great public support.  He noted there have been some controversial issues in Arvada recently but his team will work through it.  Chair Anderson expressed her excitement and hopes that our state makes it possible for people to own condos in Olde Town Arvada.

Director Menten inquired about the definition of a multi-family development.  Mr. Mosher commented that there would be multiple units within one structure.

Director Menten asked if there has been some recent legislation regarding construction liability. Mr. Mosher stated that Colorado is one of the most stringent states with regard to developer liability.  Bill Mosher stated that there has been legislation that would allow for arbitration, developers being able to fix the issue, etc., but this legislation has not passed as of yet.  The per-unit insurance cost is over $30K.Now, developers have to document everything.  Developers use third parties to document and video everything.  Mr. Mosher explained that all of these added costs are passed on to the purchaser.  He stated it is very tough for lenders to want to make loans for Condos.

Director Solano inquired about the hotel that was mentioned that would run along Vance Street. He wonders if there are any existing hotels in the area.  He also wondered who would fund construction of the hotel.  Bill Mosher commented that the feasibility studies have shown that hotels in Arvada are not really feasible; however, Arvada is interested in trying to figure out how to get a hotel in the area so Trammell Crow is trying to make that happen.  He said that funding would involve some private funding and some additional public support through the Arvada Urban Renewal Authority and the City.

#### 3. Transit-Oriented Development:  Board Update

Bill Sirois gave a brief presentation on the Transit-Oriented Development walking through the slides with an overview on:

o        Alameda Pilot

o        Welton Pilot

o        Federal Center Pilot

o        DU Station

o        Depot Square

o        I-225 Corridor

Director Lubow commented that she needs a little refresher course on the TOD process; she stated that Mr. Sirois had mentioned that this is an expanded role for RTD to assist with the TOD process.  Director Lubow wondered what resources RTDs put in to the TODs.  She asked if there was a cost/benefit analysis completed on the project.  Bill Sirois shared that the Board had previously wanted to look at an expanded view of TOD versus just looking at dollars and cents.  Things like affordable housing, increased ridership and improved station amenities will all be results of TOD.  He said that while RTD will not be making a lot of money from the project, the improved amenities add value.  Director Lubow questioned if there was any analysis of public money going to private developers.  Marla Lien explained that RTD does not directly fund housing development, retail development, etc.  RTD can share infrastructure, lighting, parking, etc. but we do not directly subsidize private development.

General Manager Washington stated that in 2009, staff brought a policy recommendation to the Board for approval.  RTD talked about doing what we can do as an agency to create vibrancy around our stations.  This action is directly tied to growing our ridership.  He believes if we have vibrancy around our stations, we are more likely to grow ridership.

Director Menten inquired about the 40 parking spaces on the north and the 60 parking spaces on the south side of Alameda Station.  She wondered why we received these spaces at no cost to RTD and if we were working with one or two developers. Bill Sirois advised that this is all the same developer.  He explained that as part of our negotiation with the developer we said that they needed to allow us these 100  parking spaces; this is a way for us to transition from a traditional Park-n-Ride facility to something that is more of a neighborhood walk up.  D4 is the developer.

Director Folska inquired about some of the other projects that had been worked on previously such as 10th & Osage and Yale Station and wondered if we are still working on those projects.  Bill Sirois replied that those projects are not part of the Pilot program.  He noted that there has been some interest by a private developer but nothing formal has happened at this time.

Chair Anderson provided a brief synopsis of how Arvada got to where they are today.  She explained that Arvada City Council decided many years ago that Olde Town should be a transit center so they changed their zoning and put a transit overlay on their comprehensive plan.  At the time, Olde Town was a suburban area allowing approximately 4 units per acre.  There has been an ongoing effort to make Olde Town Arvada into a transit oriented area, and Chair Anderson thinks it’s great that RTD was able to do a partnership with the City of Arvada and the Arvada Urban Renewal Authority.

Chair Anderson advised that she specifically did not go to the Arvada City Council meeting because she wanted the Arvada City Council to make any type of remarks they wanted without a RTD representative being present.  Chair Anderson feels that it works well to have these partnerships and also to have private investment support.

Director Sisk commented that this is an extraordinary opportunity.  He mentioned that at a future time, he would like to have a better understanding of TOD, what the partnership is about, and how it really works.  He thought it might be helpful to see a case study of a specific project so the Board can see what the public does, what the private sector does and how the economics really work. Bill Sirois suggested that Denver Union Station is the best example.  Bill Sirois indicated that staff is planning to provide a “Lessons Learned” report in 2014.

Director Solano commented that this is all great pie in the sky, future stuff, but that RTD needs to get 4 corridors done and complete the light rail.  General Manager Washington stated that these projects are happening right now.  He reiterated that these projects offer integral real benefits that could translate to value for other parts of the region.  He thinks Director Sisk’s idea of really breaking down one project is a great idea. Director Walker reiterated that these projects do create a lot of value; there are far reaching effects of these projects that can be seen everywhere, even right outside the map boundaries presented by Mr. Sirois.

Committee Chair James inquired about the Federal Center site.  He wonders how many acres there are available. Bill Sirois advised that there are around 40-45 acres.  Committee Chair James noted that this is a new format for getting value for land.  He stated that this is an efficient use of resources, both public and private, and that it is good to get things happening. He stated that some things can’t be measured quantitatively; some things can only be measured qualitatively which is sometimes difficult to measure but still has value.  Director James stated that our main mission is mobility, but this development is very important.

Director Folska expressed that she would like to see a quality of life element added to the pilot program going forward.  Bill Sirois stated that we do a quality of life report for all of FasTracks that goes beyond just TOD.  He said that staff would do a microcosm look as well.

##### a. TOD Board Update 9-3-13Final

### C. Other Matters

General Manager Washington reminded the Board that RTD’s Human Resource Department was recognized by the SHRM Colorado State Council with an award.   General Manager Washington advised that this diversity award is a testament to our strategic leadership and is a great honor.  He congratulated the RTD staff.

Director Hoy stated that a few weeks ago the Board had talked about pilot programs for creative ways to dispose of excess property.  He requested that the Board get an update sometime soon.

### E. Adjourn

Committee Chair James adjourned the meeting at 6:59 p.m.
