C. Updates

• Local Update - CRL Associates
Roger Sherman, CRL Associates, indicated that ten RTD candidates were
deemed sufficient for November’s election. He noted that four of the
districts (D, F, G and H) are uncontested and the ballot placement for
districts A, E, I and M occurred last week. He stated that District A’s
candidates are: Regan Byrd, Kate Williams, Aaron Goldhamer and Mike
Cerbo. District E’s candidates are Director Folska and JM Fay. District I’s
candidates are Véronique Marie Bellamy, Lee Kemp and Director Lubow. Lee
Kemp is a provisional candidate as he is protesting his signatures. His
appeal should be resolved this week and if he is still deemed insufficient, he
will be removed from the ballot. District M’s candidates are Dave Ruchman
and Director Menten. He added that there were several candidates across
the district who were deemed insufficient, but they did not follow up with
the proper paperwork to ensure their placement on the ballot.
Roger Sherman remarked that Mobility Choice is partnering with RTD, CDOT
and DRCOG to complete a 2030 Blueprint. He stated all of their funding is
in place which totals $1.5 million. He commented that it will be interesting
to see what comes out of the study and what will be the next major idea.
Previously, RTD participated in the MPACT 64 analysis, which was a twoyear study.
Director Lubow inquired if Jim Gunning, former Mayor of Lone Tree, was
going to be the Chair for the study. Roger Sherman indicated yes, he was.
Director Lubow asked if RTD had provided any funds towards the $1.5
million. General Manager Genova stated staff will be bringing an action item

to the Board in a few weeks to contribute a total of $500,000 to the study.
He added that CDOT and DRCOG have already funded their portions.
Director Lubow asked if the Mobility Choice Blueprint is for new technology.
Roger Sherman stated it is an issue that they are interested in, but transit is
a critical piece as is general funding.

Director Lubow commented that she thought this was previously completed
without the $1.5 million price tag. Roger Sherman stated that the MPACT
64 Study was done by the Metro Mayor’s Caucus and they used their staff
to complete the analysis.
Director James asked if initiatives such as this were being developed in
other metro areas across the county, and if so, what could be learned from
them. Roger Sherman said he was not sure if there were other studies
similar to this one, but the goal is to see what new ideas may develop
locally.
Director Menten stated there is a non-profit being formed which is funded by
three government agencies, and RTD is reducing its oversight by funding a
portion of the study. She asked if RTD pushed for an initiative or
referendum to the voters, how could RTD show transparency.
General Manager Genova remarked that the funds RTD, CDOT and DRCOG
are contributing will go towards the Mobility Choice Blueprint. He indicated
that there will be an agreement which will determine how the money is to be
used, and establish the scope. He added that there will be a Board of
Directors, and RTD will have a seat on that Board. He stated that nothing is
binding for future action, and it will be up to each entity to determine how
they wish to move forward.
Director Anderson commented that she is not enthusiastic about this study,
especially since RTD is strapped financially, and added that she does not see
this study going anywhere.
Chair Tobiassen stated that he was at the Denver Regional Council of
Governments (DRCOG) meeting when this came up. He remarked that Don
Hunt presented the study to DRCOG and commented that it will include all
aspects of transit, including transit for the transit dependent along the
Colfax corridor. He commented that it is unknown what transit will look like
in 20 to 30 years, and if we do not participate in this new study, RTD will
be putting its constituents in jeopardy.

Jenifer Brandeberry, Brandeberry ~ McKenna (BBMK), stated that they
along with General Manager Genova, Chair Tobiassen and Director Folska
met with the Legislative Audit Committee while they were in session. She
added that the Audit Committee appreciates all that the Board has done.
She remarked that in the past, it was rare for a Board member to attend and
for the current Directors to make time to attend shows the Board’s
dedication. She noted that BBMK anticipates a competitive election this
year, and there are feverishly targeted races. The conventional wisdom is
that the House will remain Democratic control, but the Senate is a tossup.
She commented that there are three races in the metro area whose
outcomes will determine the Colorado Senate.
Megan Wagner, BBMK, added that they attended a tour of the B line with
Sherry Ellebracht and the Legislative Legal Services Committee. She noted
that the tour went well and everyone was impressed with the B line.

• Federal Update - Squire Patton Boggs
Mike Dino, Squire Patton Boggs, stated that Congress went back into
session today and will be out by the end of the month. He commented that
they have 17 days to pass a continuing resolution that will allow the Federal
Government to continue working past October 1st. He noted that there will
be a lot of debate for the next three weeks as the Freedom Caucus would
like the resolution to extend the date six months from October 1st, but the
Senate Majority Leader, Harry Reid, indicated that would not happen.
Mike Dino added that Jeff Denham, the Chairman of the Federal Railroad
Sub Committee, visited last Wednesday. He commented that Chairman
Denham was on a railroad tour of the west and he wanted to see Union
Station while he was in Denver. Chairman Denham was impressed with
Union Station and the surrounding area, and was very interested in the P3
concept. He added that Chair Tobiassen and Director Folska were able to
meet with Chairman Denham and it was nice to have him here since he has
such an important role.

D. Other Matters
Director Anderson commented that she has received several phone calls from
constituents who are treated poorly by RTD’s Access-a-Ride. She added that there
needs to be some sort of triage to resolve this issue.

C. Updates

• Discussion of the 2016 Annual Program Evaluation (APE) and FasTracks
Financial Plan
General Manager Genova reminded the Board that the Annual Program
Evaluation (APE) was reviewed at the Financial Administration and Audit
Committee last month. He stated that Heather Copp would review staffs
rational behind their recommendation as well as other scenarios that were
considered and the reasons why they were not chosen by staff.
Heather Copp, Chief Financial Officer and Assistant General Manager of
Finance and Administration, stated that the August 6, 2016 Financial
Administration and Audit Committee Agenda Packet contained background
information for how staff established their forecasts. She noted that staff
compared the Baseline scenario with three other scenarios: Backfill from
Base, Backfill from FasTracks Reserves and from Base and Backfill from
FasTracks Operations and Reserves.
Heather Copp remarked that the Baseline scenario encompassed the
following:
 Moving a total of $130.8 from the Base in 2024-2030 to balance
FasTracks
 Issue Certificates of Participation (COPs) in Base in 2023 for $59.2
million for bus purchases
 Build Board appropriated and operating reserves in the Base System
to maintain equivalent of 3 months of operating reserves consistently
through 2040
 FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) is utilized to balance
FasTracks in years 2021-2024



Keep FasTracks reserves equivalent to 3 months Operations and
Maintenance (O&M)
By the end of 2040, Base System unrestricted fund balance will be
$1,352.2 million, FISA $0 and FasTracks unrestricted fund balance of
$539.6 million for a total available balance of $1,891.8 million

Heather Copp indicated that the first alternative scenario, Backfill from Base
Reserves, required the following actions:
 Moving a total of $336 million vs $130.8 from the Base System
 Increase COP issuance in base from $59.2 million to $239.6 million
 Reduce Board appropriated and operating reserves in Base System
significantly
 Keep FISA allocation going for a cumulative amount at 2040 of
$518.1 million
 Keep FasTracks reserves equivalent to 3 months O&M
 By the end of 2040, Base System unrestricted fund balance will be
$973.9 million, FISA balance of $518.1 million, and FasTracks
unrestricted fund balance of $356.8 million for a total available
balance of $1,848.8 million
She added that this option backfills from the Base to fill up the shortfall on
FasTracks and leaves the FISA account alone. She noted that since more
money would be needed than is available, staff would have to begin issuing
debt for bus purchases after 2032 to free up cash to fund FasTracks.
Heather Copp noted that the second alternative scenario, Backfill from
FasTracks Reserves first and then Backill from Base included the following
actions:
 Moving $305.6 million vs $130.8 from the base





Increase COP issuance in Base from $59.2 million to $239.6 million
Reduce Board appropriated and operating reserves in Base systems
Keep FISA allocation going for a cumulative amount at 2040 of
$518.1 million
Reduce FasTracks reserves from 3 months to 1 month O&M
By the end of 2040, Base System unrestricted fund balance of
$1,025.4 million, FISA balance of$518.1 million, and FasTracks
unrestricted balance of $304.1 million for a total available balance of
$1,844.6 million

She stated that with this scenario, there will still be a need to issue the
same amount of debt as the first alternative. While the reserves are a bit
higher, there is only one month of O&M instead of three.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Sep 6, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)



Heather Copp noted that the third and final alternative was to Backfill from
FasTracks Reserves and FasTracks Operations and Maintenance:
 No base funding used for FasTracks
 Keep FISA allocation going for a cumulative amount at 2040 of
$518.1 million
 Reduce FasTracks reserves from 3 months to 1 month O&M
 Reduce service on W Line, R Line, University of Colorado A Line, G
Line, B Line, N Line, Flatiron Flyer, and eliminate Free MetroRide for
total savings of $352.9 million
 By the end of 2040, Base System unrestricted fund balance of
$1,545.8 million, FISA balance of $518.1 million, and FasTracks
unrestricted balance of $304.1 million for a total available balance of
$2,368.0
She added that while this scenario does not issue additional debt, staff had
to reduce service on every line in the FasTracks system and eliminate the
Free MetroRide. This option provides the greatest amount of savings but it
decimates the operating service in FasTracks.
Heather Copp remarked that staff’s thought process was that it was prudent
not to issue additional debt or cut service, therefore, the Baseline scenario
was the best option for the Agency.
Director Anderson indicated she spent the afternoon reviewing the charts
and noted that the Baseline scenario was the most appropriate option. She
commented that the alternative scenarios are very risky and RTD should
have more than three months of O&M reserves. She remarked that when
RTD gets to the other side of this, it will have the same amount of money as
the other scenarios. She added that arguing over a reserve account does
not make sense, but it is important to be fiscally responsible to all of RTD’s
constituents to ensure that RTD does not have to quadruple its debt.
Director Solano stated that there is still a lot of North Metro that needs to be
done and asked staff to set up meetings with the local jurisdictions to
discuss the APE, FiSA and RAM.
Committee Chair Hoy asked that staff set up meetings before the September
27th Board Meeting with any local jurisdictions that were interested.
Director Lasater asked if staff had factored in population growth for the
various scenarios. He stated that RTD needs to adequately and sufficiently
factor this in. Heather Copp stated that there were no growth projections
factored into any of the scenarios, but taking money from the Base system
does not reduce service. She commented that it would take away some
ability to potentially allow for increased service, but funds could always be
moved back to the Base system at a future time.

Director Lubow said whatever scenario the Board adopts, Base money will
need to go to FasTracks. She remarked that RTD has been building
FasTracks on the backs of the northern taxpayers and they have continued
to contribute, but got nothing in return. She stated that what is happening
to FISA is not fair to the northern constituents. She indicated that the
people in the north want to get to 144th, not 124th, and she thinks this can
be solved with a small tax increase.
Director Bagley stated that one of the things the Board needs to consider is
when will the next recession hit. He commented that the Board needs to be
financially prudent and have substantial reserves instead of a marginal
amount of money. He stated that it is not just about the Northwest Rail or
the North Metro continuation. It is about every corridor and a lot of people
across the District feel that they paid and got nothing from FasTracks. He
added that to go out and spend more money and have more debt issued is a
concern. He remarked that staff works prudently to examine the best
options for the Agency and he trusts their recommendations.
Director Sisk indicated that there are a number of contrary points being
examined. He remarked that the FISA account was set up as a contract
with the voters that had not received their corridors. He noted that the
concern now is that by doing away with the FISA, RTD’s commitment in
2012 did not mean anything. He stated the other paradigm is that RTD is in
a financial crisis and the FISA money would allow RTD to borrow less. He
remarked that he would like to see staff review naming rights and other
revenue streams and added that RTD needs to examine the contracts it has
made with its constituents.
Director Anderson said that Director Sisk is correct and there has to be some
other ways to finance FISA, or as least look at other options. She stated
that the packet showed that some of the expected financing did not
materialize and the Board needs to be aware of that. She believes that the
most responsible way to get through the next few years is using the
Baseline option, but the Board will still have the same obligation in 2040 to

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Sep 6, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Lubow stated that she had asked Heather Copp to run an additional
scenario which returned funds to the FISA as they became availible.
Heather Copp indicated she had run additional scenarios which examined
reestablishing the FISA in 2030. She commented that staff could look at
refunding the FISA in 2030 up to $224.6 million, but that it would take all
of RTD’s unrestricted funds and money from the Base to get there. She said
that while there is a way of doing it, RTD would end up in the same exact
position as the Baseline scenario. She remarked it is financially feasible to
get there, but the political decision today would be moving Base money into
FISA and making that commitment.

build the Northwest rail and the North Metro line. She added that she is
happy that the Eagle P3 Project worked, but the Board is arguing over
something that it should be proud of.

Director Lubow stated that there is an agreement to finish FastTracks. She
added that right now, it is the obligation of RTD and the Board to get it
done.
Committee Chair Hoy encouraged staff to sit down with representatives
from Adams County and US 36. General Manager Genova stated that staff
will have a variety of meetings with stakeholders from across the district.

D. Other Matters
Director Lubow stated that she saw a lot of letters to the editor in the Boulder Daily
Camera about the transit center at Denver International Airport (DIA). The
complaints stated that the escalators are far away and the signage is bad. She
indicated that while the transit center at DIA is not necessarily RTD’s responsibility
in many aspects, we need to answer to our ridership.
Committee Chair Hoy stated that RTD is working with the airport to address all of
those concerns.
Director Lubow asked if RTD could use the money from the Denver Transit
Partner’s (DDP) penalties to reimburse people who have missed their flights.
General Manger Genova stated that use of the penalty money would be at the
discretion of the Board. He remarked that there have only been two deductions,
but the majority of that share is $250,000 a month that began in June. That
deduction will continue to occur until all of the grate crossings on the University of
Colorado A line pass their inspection. He added that similarly, on the B line, if that
singular crossing is not approved in September, $100,000 will be withheld until it
passes. Right now, there is a design time for how long the gates stay down at
each crossing and half of the crossings do not meet that criteria.
Director Lubow stated that she would like to see that money be used for
constituent concerns at DIA.
Director Lasater said he rode the University of Colorado A line to DIA and he would
concur that the signage is minimal, but the ticket booths are convenient. He
indicated there is a walking distance to get to the train, but the platforms are well
marked. He suggested that the train operators inform passengers that the train has
to stop for an oncoming train since part of the track is single track. He stated that
when the train momentarily stopped, people had assumed that the train broke
Packet Pg. 14

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Sep 6, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director James thanked staff for exploring the various alternatives, and
clearly what they have showed the Board is that there are several routes to
get to the same place, but the Baseline option provides the least amount of
risk. He noted that staff is projecting what will occur in 20 to 30 years, but
those projections will be wrong. He stated that staff cannot accurately
predict the future because of the ever changing economy.

down. He commented that if the train is stopping as planned, it would be nice to
let people know it will only be for a minute or two.
Director Solano stated that he travelled on the bus and train all last week from
Parker and he was only asked for proof of fare once. He stated that fare
inspections need to be consistent.

General Manager Genova stated that there is a security officer on the University of
Colorado A line to satisfy the Federal Railroad Commission’s’ requirement of two
employees on each train. He said the reason that those inspectors check fares
twice is so that they may capture additional boarding’s at various stops. He stated
that on light rail, having an officer on each train would require additional funds.
General Manager Genova introduced Mike Meader, the new Chief Safety Officer
(CSO) and Assistant General Manager of Safety, Security and Asset Management.

E. Next Meeting Date - October 04, 2016
F. Motion to Move into Executive Session
Rolf Asphaug, General Counsel, stated that an Executive Session is being held and
only the Board and necessary staff may attend. He remarked that the Sunshine Act
requires that the Board identify the session in as much detail, and there must be an
affirmative vote of 2/3.
Motion:

C. Updates

• Proposed Winter 2016/2017 Service Change
Gina Callahan, Acting Deputy Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations,
noted that the proposed Winter 2016-2017 Service Changes were outlined
in the September 20, 2016 Operations and Customer Service Committee
Agenda Packet. She reminded the Board that these were not for approval.
Staff wanted the Board to be aware of the proposed changes prior to the
public hearings. She said Jessie Carter, Manager of Service Planning and
Scheduling, was with her to answer any questions.
Director Francone pointed out that there are recommendations for service
reductions in Jefferson County. She asked staff to provide further details
about the proposed changes. Jessie Carter stated one of the changes was
the proposed W Line service reduction. He explained the reduction would
establish 15 minute headways similar to the other light rail lines. He said
boarding per hour for the W Line average around 72 while our other light rail
lines are in the 120 to 130 range so the current headways are not justified.
Director Francone indicated she was specifically concerned about the
cancellation of Route 116L. Jessie Carter explained that in 2013 with the
launch of the W Line certain bus service was cancelled; however, it was
determined that there were a number of trips that then took much longer
than anticipated so Route 116L was introduced. Jessie Carter pointed out

Director Anderson participated by phone.

6.C

Director Lubow asked if the changes would go into effect in January. She
thought that Route L was supposed to be having some changes but
commented that they were not included in these recommendations. Jessie
Carter indicated staff anticipates the proposed Winter 2016-2017 service
changes going into effect in December or January. He said the Route L
changes Director Lubow was referencing were actually part of the fall
runboard that has not yet occurred, but staff would notify the Board before
they take effect.
Director Bagley wondered why the W Line originally had 7.5 minute
headways when compared to the other lines that were at 15 minutes.
Jessie Carter stated that Lakewood and the other municipalities were
originally promised that there would be 5 minute headways; however, he
reiterated that ridership does not support the current headways which is
why staff is recommending the change.
Director Bagley commented that with the current budget shortfalls, he is
pleased to see staff being prudent and recommending service changes that
result in a $1.6 million savings.
Director Sisk said he agrees with Director Bagley’s comments and really
applauds the savings. He asked staff to make sure they are proactive in
communicating with our constituents about alternative service options,
especially with the changes to the RockiesRide services.
Director Menten inquired if discontinuing Route 89 would impact anyone’s
access to Access-a-Ride. Jessie Carter stated staff had not done an analysis
but would get back to the Board with that information. He pointed out that
this route has a very high subsidy per boarding. Director Menten recognized
that it might have a high subsidy but it would be an issue if cancelling the
route impacted someone’s ability to use Access-a-Ride.
Director Solano shared that he had been traveling between Commerce City
and Parker recently and pointed out that Route 483 only had service during
the a.m. peak hours. He stated getting to Parker is like pulling teeth. Jessie
Carter indicated that Route 483 is a new route that has service during a.m.
and p.m. peak hours. He shared that the route is performing better than
expected but ridership does not currently justify mid-day or weekend
service. He said this is something staff hopes the route will grow into.

Packet Pg. 19

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Sep 20, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

that Route 116L is duplicated by several services, thus the ridership for
those routes is being cannibalized. He noted ridership on Route 116L is very
low. Director Francone asked to discuss the cancellation offline.

• ADA Expert First Annual Report
Gina Callahan reminded the Board that this report was required as part of
the settlement agreement that was reached with the Colorado Cross
Disability Coalition as it related to individuals with mobility aids having equal
access to fixed-route buses. She noted the report was included in the
September 20, 2016 Operations and Customer Service Committee Agenda
Packet. She thanked Carolyn Conover, Senior Manager of Contracted
Service, and Alice Osner, General Superintendent of Transportation, for the
tremendous amount of work they did in helping with this report.

• 2016 2nd Quarter Contracted Fixed Route Report
Gina Callahan indicated the report was included in the September 20, 2016
Operations and Customer Service Committee Agenda Packet. She stated this
item will be discussed further in the Financial Administration and Audit
Committee.
There were no questions from the Board.

• 2016 2nd Quarter Access-a-Ride/Cab Report
Gina Callahan indicted the report was included in the September 20, 2016
Operations and Customer Service Committee Agenda Packet.
Director Anderson expressed that one issue facing Access-a-Ride users is
how trips are handled when the driver does not show up and the trip is
rescheduled. Specifically, she received a complaint from a woman who
needed to get to work. When another driver was sent, Access-a-Ride drove
right past her place of employment to take another passenger to adult
daycare. She believes priority should be given to passengers trying to get to
work. Carolyn Conover stated it was difficult to understand how the
scheduling software works when a trip needs to be fit in to something
already scheduled.
Director Deadwyler stated that a lot of our passengers with disabilities do
not call to report issues with their drivers because staff does not log the
issues. She said that an elderly couple was left all day with no one to pick
them up. She asked that the Dispatch Center’s process be reviewed and
updated. She remarked that she too uses Access-a-Ride and has had the
same issues.
Director Folska said she appreciates the challenge to provide this type of
door to door service, but stated this might be a more appropriate relationship
to have with Uber or Lyft. She agreed that the system for Dispatch and
Planning are not good and asked Auditing to review those processes for
improvement or streamlining.

Director Solano said the call center should be monitored for accuracy and
efficiency. He stated that the hold time gap should be closed so that the
riders can get their ride and get going.

• Special Services 2nd Qtr Report
Gina Callahan indicated the report was included in the September 20, 2016
Operations and Customer Service Committee Agenda Packet. She stated
this item will be discussed further in the Financial Administration and Audit
Committee.
There were no questions from the Board.

• 2016 2nd Quarter Drug & Alcohol Compliance Monitoring
Carolyn Conover indicated the report was included in the September 20,
2016 Operations and Customer Service Committee Agenda Packet. She
stated this is a new report that will be included in the quarterly updates and
it includes statistics through the second quarter of 2016.
There were no questions from the Board.

• 2016 2nd Quarter Customer Complaint Analysis
Gina Callahan commented that this report broke down the various customer
experiences and included complaint analysis. She indicated some of the
data from the video tapes has not been as good, but staff hopes with
improvements they can be used for coaching and training. Carolyn Conover
noted the results still show the impact of the operator shortages with a high
number of complaints related to buses not showing up, being late, someone
got passed up, etc. She indicated these issues were improving but it is still
a challenge to get operators.
Director Francone asked if there was a way to identify complaints by
District, specifically for District N. Carolyn Conover said she would work
with customer care to determine the best way to organize the information.
She stated the complaints could be sorted by route but she was unsure if it
could be pulled by location.

Packet Pg. 21

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Sep 20, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager of Communications, stated there are
two different systems involved. The Telephone Information Center (TIC)
accepts all type of customer calls, the other call center is for Access-a-Ride.
As Gina Callahan previously mentioned, Customer Care records and monitors
all calls.

• 2nd Quarter 2016 Security Statistics & Fare Inspection Summary
Director Solano commented that fare evasion is listed as 1.6% on this
report, but he feels it is much higher. He said he is never asked for his pass
on the light rail and thinks RTD is losing money.

Director Walker said in his experience on light rail, almost everyone has a
ticket. He stated that the fare inspectors often go from one end of the train
to the other checking fares without stopping to write a ticket.
Director Deadwyler noted the complaints against security were not listed in
the report. She asked for the number of constituents who complain about
how they are treated by RTD Security as she thinks the complaints are
numerous. She added that the contractor who provides security services on
the rail lines are not getting the same training that the RTD officers are
receiving which needs to be addressed.
Director Anderson remarked it was astonishing that 700,000 patrons were
checked for fares. She said statistically, RTD is doing well and she is okay
with the system as it is because there are undercover officers who ride the
rails.

D. Other Matters
Director Folska indicated she attended the APTA Annual Conference in Los Angeles
last week and it was the first time she was able to ride the train from downtown to
Santa Monica. She said the train had a recording which reminded passengers to
tap on and tap off and recommended that RTD provide the same type of
announcements.
Director Solano added he too attended the APTA Annual Conference and the L.A.
Metro system has a turn style at each exit which also forced people to tap their
cards. He said L.A. is doing things right and RTD should learn from them.
Director Francone commented that the APTA Annual Conference had sessions
devoted to transit Board Directors. She said most sessions are fairly technical, but
she was happy that there were sessions of interest to her as a Director which
covered ADA compliance as well as first and last mile issues.
Director Anderson agreed that RTD could use the recorded reminder on the trains
for the local college students so that staff can gather accurate ridership figures.

Packet Pg. 22

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Sep 20, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

General Manager Genova stated the information in the report is based on
fare inspectors and plain clothes officers. Staff is using current resources to
increase peak service inspections.

6.C

Committee Vice-Chair Walker said the APTA Conference theme this year was how
to integrate technology with transportation. He added that one of the liveliest
sessions at the conference covered affordable housing and overall, it was a very
interesting convention.

B. Recommended Actions

• Enter into Contracts/Agreements to Contribute Funding Towards the Mobility
Choice Blueprint
It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee
that the RTD Board of Directors approve a budget transfer and authorize
the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into any and all contracts or
agreements required to provide $500,000 in Regional Transportation District
funding in support of the Mobility Choice Blueprint as articulated in this
Board Report.
Motion:

Director Sisk made the motion to move this item
to the full Board at the September 27, 2016
Board Meeting.
Director Bagley seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager of Planning, stated
that the Mobility Choice Blueprint is a collaborative effort. He
remarked that three public agencies have been requested to
each contribute $500,000 and that all public agency dollars
are for the purpose of funding the study. He added that the
Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) and the
Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) have already
funded their portion of the study and that the focus of the
study is to understand the future of transportation technology
trends. He stated that in terms of governance, RTD, CDOT
Packet Pg. 25

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Sep 20, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Anderson participated by phone. Directors Anderson, Archuleta, Deadwyler,
Lasater, Sisk and Solano left the meeting early.

6.D

Director Bagley stated that RTD has partnered with CDOT and
DRCOG on many things in the past and it is imperative that
RTD participate in this effort. He said if not, RTD will be
missing a great opportunity. He added that first and last mile
issues as well as Uber and Lyft are all topics that need to be
discussed and addressed and this study will accomplish that.
Director Solano asked if there was anyone in the audience
from Mobility Choice that could speak to the Board.
Don Hunt, Executive Director of Mobility Choice Blueprint,
stated that he was pleased to be able to address the Board.
He noted that he was the former CDOT Director and had
worked with RTD for the Union Station project and US36
express lanes. He said that technology has impacted so many
aspects of our lives, and he has addressed various entities for
the past year and half discussing how technology will change
our futures.
Kelly Brough, Denver Metro Chamber President and CEO,
commented that the chamber has had a long history working
with RTD. She noted that the chamber wants to continue that
relationship and plan for the future to build a system to benefit
employees, families and children. She added that it would be
an honor to work with RTD to create that vision together.
Director Solano stated that RTD has not had a good track
record with studies in the past. He asked what this study
would offer RTD that the previous studies have not.
Director Lubow commented that this is an issue of great
importance, but she has concerns about the path being
proposed. She said RTD is going through a financial crisis, but
the Board is being asked to fund a third of the study costs.
She added that she does not think it is necessary to create a
separate non-profit entity and remarked that the Mobility
Choice Board would not be representative of RTD’s ridership.

Packet Pg. 26

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Sep 20, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

and DRCOG will all have a leadership role. There will be a four
(4) person oversight committee and RTD will have one
Mobility Choice Board Member appointee. He added that none
of Mobility Choices’ recommendations will be binding and the
RTD Board can choose to accept or reject the
recommendations.

6.D

Director Francone remarked that one of the reasons she voted
no on this item at the DRCOG RTC meeting was that the
composition of the Mobility Choice Board is primarily Denver
and Boulder. She stated that there is no representation from
many counties, low income, ADA, or elderly communities.
She added that RTD would only have one vote on that Board
and our voice could be silenced. She stated that the study
duplicates previous efforts by RTD, CDOT and DRCOG and
she would be voting no on this item.
Director Lasater stated that he too has a concern with the
make-up of the Mobility Choice Board. He said if the study is
going to discuss how to make transportation better through
technology, there will be problems if people do not know the
right questions to ask. He added that spending a lot of money
with people whose understanding of technology is limited, is
not good.
Director Sisk commented that these are people who have
stepped up to serve. He said RTD’s choice here is to be a part
of something for the future, or allow the $500,000 price tag
to thwart us. He said that RTD should be respectful of the
people who have come forward to be a part of this team, and
if RTD wants to be leaders in transportation, we need to get
together and move forward. He said that for RTD to not be a
part of this partnership would be unfathomable.
Director Folska said that the Denver metro area has some of
the brightest minds in transportation. She added that she
would like to see the collaboration continue, but without the
$500,000 price tag.
Director Anderson remarked that she has a deep concern
about spending money but then putting the plans on shelves,
but recognized that RTD needs to make sure that it is building
for the future.
Packet Pg. 27

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Sep 20, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director James stated that he has been watching new
technologies come along. He said that joining this study is a
strategic move that RTD needs to make. He added that
society is on the threshold of change and RTD can be
fundamental to that change. He remarked that RTD needs to
partner with our peers to see what types of services we have
today that are in danger of being cannibalized by the new
types of services available.

6.D

Director Hoy stated that he struggles with this, but he
understands that RTD needs to look at the future. He said
that he grapples with the general concept of studies and RTD
needs to focus on how it is going to maintain and sustain our
operations. He added that he will not be supporting this item
as money is tight and those funds should be used elsewhere in
the Agency.

Director Bagley suggested that the Mobility Choice Study
should have a citizen advisory committee to provide feedback
to the appointed Board to better address the diversity
concerns expressed by the RTD Board Members.
Director James indicted that the metro area and RTD will
suffer if RTD is not a participant in this study.
Director Walker commented that the purpose of this study is
to examine technological options to bring forth efficiencies for
mobility. He added that this study is to further the mission of
moving people and goods faster and easier, and he will be
supporting this item.
Director Anderson said that the Board needs to embrace this
study and look to the future. She added that the $500,000
price tag is a small price to pay to be a part of the future.
Director Folska voiced concerns that the study was not ready
for prime time. She recommended that staff speak to Google
and Tesla to use Denver as an experiment, and have them pay
for the study.
General Manager Genova stated that there has been a lot of
dialogue about creating a project advisory committee to
discuss items important to various communities and ensure
diverse, broad representation. He said as it relates to
deliverables, he has stressed that the deliverables need to be
actionable. He added that this study is a great opportunity to
collaborate with our peers.

Basic Engineering
It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee
that the RTD Board of Directors approve a transfer of $3.5 million from
the Planning expense grant project budget to a new capital project for the
SH 119 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Corridor, which will permit staff to seek
consultant services for assistance in the preparation of National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review and Advanced Basic Engineering
services. A total of $1.5 million in funding for this project was approved
in the 2016 Amended Budget in the Planning expense grant budget, and
the remaining funds are planned for 2017 and 2018 in the 2017-2022
Strategic Budget Plan (SBP).
Motion:

Director Deadwyler made the motion to move
this item to the full Board at the September 27,
2016 Board Meeting.
Director Lubow seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Heather Copp, Chief Financial Officer and Assistant General
Manager of Finance and Administration, stated that staff is
requesting advance funding for this project. She said that the
original plan was to have the funding available over a threeyear period, but in order to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP)
all of the funds need to be available at one time. She noted
that it will mean additional dollars are available in 2017 and
2018. She stressed that this did not change the project as
originally approved but just consolidated the funding into one
year.
Director Hoy stated that the Board is being asked to spend
more money while tightening our belt. He said that he would
not be supporting this item.
Director Solano said that he would support this to advance the
northwest corridor.

• Enter Contract to Purchase Cybersecurity Consulting Services
It is recommended by the Financial, Administration and Audit Committee
that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee
to enter into contract negotiations with Parsons Corporation to retain this
firm for work order-based cybersecurity consulting services to support
RTD’s cybersecurity program. The estimated cost of the Cybersecurity
Services Work Order Contract of $1,818,700 includes security risk
assessment, technical testing, control design, and control implementation
activities and will be funded from the cybersecurity operations and
maintenance budget approved for 2016 forward. Actual expenditures
will be based on work orders constructed and issued by the
cybersecurity project team, but are not to exceed the total budgeted for
this contract.
Motion:

Chair Tobiassen made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the September 27,
2016 Board Meeting.
Director Solano seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Heather Copp remarked that the cyber security funds have
already been budgeted for 2016. She indicated that staff
followed RTD’s procurement process and a selection
committee evaluated and identified the best candidate,
Parsons Corporation, to meet RTD’s needs. She stated that

She stated that she would not be supporting this item.

staff would like to award a two-year contract to Parsons, with
three one-year options.
Director Folska asked if this contract would have any type of
integration with the Xerox contract and the Smart Card
program.

Director Solano inquired as to the last time RTD had a
significant cyber security impact or breach. Sheri Le stated
that RTD has not had a significant breach that we know of.
She remarked that RTD needs to improve its capabilities to
detect if there is a breach and to be proactive to stay ahead of
the curve.
Chair Tobiassen stated that he has been pushing RTD to
become aggressive in the Information Technology and Cyber
Security realm. He pointed out that this is work order based
and only the money that needs to be spent is spent.
Director Francone remarked that she was impressed with the
information presented during the executive session and agreed
that there is a definite need for this.
Director Anderson stated she would be supporting this as she
is in favor of anything that protects our customers.
Director Solano inquired if this was even necessary as RTD
received federal funds. He thought that would mean RTD falls
within the prevue of Homeland Security. Sheri Le explained
that while Homeland Security is great at finding areas for
improvement, they do not provide the resources to make those
improvements a reality.

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors adopts the 2017-2022 Strategic Budget Plan
(SBP).
Motion:

Director Bagley made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the September 27,
2016 Board Meeting.
Director Deadwyler seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Heather Copp stated that the Board has seen the Strategic
Budget Plan (SBP) for the past three months. She added that
Jannette Scarpino will discuss the one update to the SBP.
Jannette Scarpino, Senior Manager of Budget and Financial
Analysis, commented that the final draft of the SBP was
presented to the Board in August. She stated that it was
necessary to update the August version of the SBP for
accelerated fleet purchases. She remarked that the fleet
purchase was moved from 2021 to 2018, with the fleet
arriving in 2019. She commented that the 2018 fleet
purchase will be done by available cash flow, grants, and the
Capital Replacement fund. She reminded the Board that the
SBP is balanced over the six (6) year period, but there are
factors outside of RTD’s control such as: sales tax revenue,
cost of fuel, economic conditions, etc. She stated there may
be additional expenses or reductions, but staff will be
challenged by the unpredictability of consumer spending
behaviors.

• Discussion and Action of the 2016 Annual Program Evaluation (APE) and
Financial Plan
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee
that the RTD Board of Directors adopts the 2016 Annual Program
Evaluation (APE) and Financial Plan as outlined below.
Motion:

Director Deadwyler made the motion to move
this item to the full Board at the September 27,
2016 Board Meeting.
Chair Tobiassen seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Heather Copp stated that the September 20, 2016 Financial
Administration and Audit Committee Packet included a new
option that it is a modified Baseline scenario. She commented
that one of the main concerns from RTD’s stakeholders was
that the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) was being
eliminated. She stated that the additional scenario provides
some assurances that RTD is trying to fill up the FISA and that
it will not be eliminated.
Director Bagley noted the only difference for the modified
Baseline scenario is that money was moved from one account
to another, and it was called something different. He asked
staff to display the Baseline scenario with the modified
Baseline scenario side by side for the Board Packet.
Director Solano stated that the FISA was promised to the
unfunded corridors and RTD needs to use those funds for
what they were originally intended to be used for.
Director Sisk indicated that he is concerned about the money
in the FISA account going away. He stated that these funds
were supposed to be set aside for FasTracks projects and he is
worried about the perception the public will have with the

Board. He said that staff has done a good job to try and
account for financial shortfalls, but he is not satisfied.

Director Hoy thanked staff for their meetings with the
stakeholders and sees this as a step in the right direction. He
added that he will vote no on this item tonight as he feels that
there is room for more dialogueue.

C. Updates

• 2017 Requested Budget
Jannette Scarpino stated that this is the first draft of the 2017 Requested
Budget. She commented that RTD must post the 2017 budget for public
review and comment by October 15, 2016 to meet Colorado legal
requirements. She added that an update will be provided at the October 18,
2016 Financial Administration and Audit (FAA) committee meeting, and the
final budget will be presented at the November 15, 2016 FAA committee
meeting with staff requesting adoption at the November 22, 2015 Board
Meeting. She remarked that the Base System and FasTracks budgets are
still fluid. The funding sources include: fare revenue estimates, sales taxes,
grant revenue, and capital expenditures for both new capital and capital
carry forward amounts. She stated that Operating expense will likely be
revised for specific items that were not included in the SBP.

• Second Quarter 2016 Performance Report
Jannette Scarpino indicated the report was included in the September 20,
2016 Financial Administration and Audit Committee Agenda Packet so she
would just speak to some of the areas where we did not meet goal. She
commented that through the second quarter, there was a small increase in
the passenger accidents of which three were preventable. She stated that
customer complaints were 4.2% and overall, the system complaints met the

goal, but three independent carriers did not. This is attributed to the
dropped runs due to lack of bus operators.
Director Francone asked if there are consequences for failure to comply with
RTD’s service goals. Carolyn Conover, Senior Manager of Contracted
Services, said yes, and added that RTD has liquidated damages in our
contracts with our contractors.

• Smart Media Technology (SMT) Monthly Update
Heather Copp stated that staff received the report from the independent
auditor regarding cyber security. She said that the reason the portal has not
gone live was because of concerns about cyber security and she remarked
that the report was not good. She stated that in response to the report,
staff has provided Xerox with a Notice to Cure. She commented that Xerox
has until Friday, September 23rd to respond. She explained that until staff
hears back from Xerox they do not know what action will be taken next.
She said it is serious, but it forces Xerox to respond to staff’s list of
concerns.
Director Lubow asked if there is a new timeline for the portal going live.
Heather Copp said no, there was no timeline until the cyber security issues
are fixed.
Committee Chair Menten asked if Xerox was providing any other services to
RTD. Heather Copp stated that Xerox is only working with RTD on the
Smart Card project.
Director Sisk inquired how staff was communicating to the public that the
Smart Card is not going live. Heather Copp remarked that staff did not
publicize the July 1st go live date. She added that the pilot program users
have inquired about a web portal, but staff never made a public
announcement. Director Sisk stated that staff should be proactive and let
the public know that this project is in the works, but there are issues that
need to be resolved.
Chair Tobiassen said that another matter is the King Soopers/AlbertsonsSafeway program. Heather Copp indicated that RTD is ready to go into the
pilot stores. Tonya Anderson, Manager of Electronic Fare Operations,
remarked that there are three stores that will enter the pilot program. She
stated that King Soopers is not willing to open the program to the rest of
their stores until the web portal is live.

• July 2016 Monthly Financial Status Report
Doug MacLeod, Controller, indicated that the Monthly Financial Status
Report still shows a lot of red, but the variances are smaller. He stated
there were sales tax refunds in February and July which negatively impacted
our sales and use tax revenues. He remarked that ridership was 11.9%
short, but the fare revenue aligned with the Amended Budget for the month.
He added that CU Leeds will attend the October 18, 2016 Financial
Administration and Audit Committee to provide the Board with their
September forecast.

Ann Marie Isaac-Heslop, Manager of Internal Audit, stated that staff had
included the Quarterly Audit Update in the September 20, 2016 Financial
Administration and Audit Committee packet.
Chair Tobiassen commented on the earlier Cyber Security briefing and noted
that most assessments are done independently and added that staff should
have a cyber-security auditor in the audit department.

D. Other Matters
Director Bagley said that even though the Board voted against the Mobility Choice
action item, he still wants General Manager Genova to serve in the best way he can
on the Mobility Choice Board. He asked that the General Manager provide updates
as they are available so that the RTD Board can stay informed. He added that
because the Board did not vote in favor of that item, it did not mean that he should
not participate on the Mobility Choice Board.
Director James concurred with Director Bagley and stated that General Manager
Genova should continue his work with Mobility Choice.
Chair Tobiassen stated that his tenure on the RTD Board will be ending in a few
months, but he hopes that he too can participate with the Mobility Choice Board in
some capacity. He said technology is rapidly changing and he fully supports
General Manager Genova being involved and staying in touch with technology as
we move forward.
Director Bagley added that he spoke to Don Hunt prior to the committee meeting
and stated that he too would like to be involved in any way to assist the Mobility
Choice Board. He recommended that Directors James and Walker do the same.
Director Walker shared in Director Bagley and Director James’ statements.

Bylaws/Procedures Discussion
Barbara McManus reminded the executive committee that they had been provided with an
opportunity to review the Bylaws and Expense Policy and request changes. She said
those edits had been made and provided each executive committee member with an
updated red-lined copy. She shared that before the Bylaws can be brought forward for
approval the full Board must review them for 10 working days. She asked the executive
committee to review the revised Bylaws and provide her with any comments by Thursday,
September 29th. She said once the final approval has been given by Chair Tobiassen she
would send them to the full Board with the plan of bringing the Bylaws forward for
approval at the October 25th Board Meeting. Barbara McManus said this would allow for
changing the FasTracks Monitoring and Planning and Development committee meeting
structure by December, as requested by the committee chairs.

Chair Tobiassen suggested if there were any questions that the Directors should contact
Rolf Asphaug, General Counsel, or Jennifer Ross-Amato, Acting Deputy General Counsel,
as they can explain any technical aspects of the changes.
September Board Meeting Agenda Review
Chair Tobiassen provided an overview of the agenda and indicated that overall there were
not many action items.
Director Hoy inquired if it would be appropriate to review the new FasTracks Monitoring
and Planning and Development committee structure during the Committee Reports. Chair
Tobiassen indicated that would really be new business but does not think it should be
presented until the Bylaws are approved.
Director Francone shared that her GM Oversight and Performance Management update
would just be a review of the timeline as General Manager Genova would not be
presenting his Goal Attainment memo until the October 18th GM Oversight and
Performance Management committee meeting.
Director Hoy said that he expected comments from the north regarding the FasTracks
Annual Program Evaluation. He shared that he and General Manager Genova recently
attended a Northwest Area Transportation Association (NATA) meeting. It seemed they
were more receptive to the new scenario prepared by Heather Copp, CFO and Assistant
General Manager of Finance and Administration, but thought they might ask for some little
tweaks.
General Manager Genova explained that NATA was asking RTD to commit any funds we
receive over our projections to the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA). He
commented that RTD will have the revenues we have and if those are over projections the
funds would go into the FasTracks bucket. Director Hoy stated General Manager Genova
hit on a key point. He pointed out that the reason this is an issue is because of how the
funds were classified to begin with. If different wording had been used it might have
looked more palatable to everyone. He suggested this be a lesson learned going forward.
Chair Tobiassen agreed it was more semantics than mathematics.
Chair Tobiassen asked for a motion to move the September Board meeting agenda
forward.
Motion:

Director Francone made the motion to approve
moving the September 27th Board meeting
agenda to the full Board.

Enter Contract to Purchase Cybersecurity Consulting Services

It is recommended by the Financial, Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to enter
into contract negotiations with Parsons Corporation to retain this firm for work
order-based cybersecurity consulting services to support RTD’s cybersecurity
program. The estimated cost of the Cybersecurity Services Work Order Contract
of $1,818,700 includes security risk assessment, technical testing, control
design, and control implementation activities and will be funded from the
cybersecurity operations and maintenance budget approved for 2016 forward.
Actual expenditures will be based on work orders constructed and issued by the
cybersecurity project team, but are not to exceed the total budgeted for this
contract.

Other Matters
Director Solano shared he was speaking with Ashland Vaughn, North Metro Project
Manager, about some issues they were having getting BNSF to agree to some design
changes that need to occur for the North Metro Rail Line. He expressed concern this
might impact the completion date and wondered if legal needed to be involved. General
Manager Genova said he was not aware of the specific issue mentioned by Director Solano
but he would check into it.
Director Solano stated he attended the APTA Annual Conference in L.A. and indicated he
had some reservations about if the money RTD is spending with APTA and on these
conferences it worth it. He believes the Agency needs to do a cost/benefit analysis to see
if what is being spent is a worthwhile investment. He believes the Board members should
be able to attend any conference related to transportation. Director Francone pointed out
that Board members could already do that as long as the Chair of the Board approved their
attendance.
Director Solano inquired how much RTD pays to be a member of APTA. General Manager
Genova said he did not know the exact number but it was around $80-90K. He explained
that it was a tiered approach based on the agency’s size. Director Francone asked what
RTD gets in return for that money. General Manager Genova stated the primary benefit is
the representation APTA does at the Federal level influencing regulations, funding, etc. He
said the other benefits include industry reports, peer reviews, and professional
development programs.
Director Solano believes it would be beneficial to be in contact with people from New York
to learn why they left APTA. General Manager Genova shared that he has heard they will
probably be returning.
Director Solano expressed concern that APTA was not acting as a non-partisan
organization. He feels if they are influencing people in D.C. they are only influencing one
side.

expense grant project budget to a new capital project for the SH 119 Bus Rapid
Transit (BRT) Corridor, which will permit staff to seek consultant services for
assistance in the preparation of National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review
and Advanced Basic Engineering services. A total of $1.5 million in funding for
this project was approved in the 2016 Amended Budget in the Planning expense
grant budget, and the remaining funds are planned for 2017 and 2018 in the
2017-2022 Strategic Budget Plan (SBP).

6.F

General Manager Genova expressed that the APTA committees are also incredibly
valuable, not only from a learning perspective but also in influencing APTA leadership.
Director Francone indicated she had signed up for several committees the previous year
and had never heard from anyone. General Manager Genova said he would look into it.
Director Hoy believes if we were to look at other industry associations the cost would be
in line with what RTD is paying to be a member of APTA. He stated what Director Solano
and Francone are talking about really needs to be divided into two issues: (1) what RTD
gets from APTA as an agency and (2) discussing how Directors are spending their own
resources.
Director Francone commented that while the Agency may benefit from APTA
representation on a Federal level, RTD also has our own federal lobbyists. She said it may
be a stronger message with the two advancing our causes but it is important to have a
good, hard look at all RTD’s expenditures since we are asking the Agency to tighten its
belt.

Director Francone shared that she too is questioning the value of the APTA conferences.
She thinks there are other places for Board training that could be better suited for the
Directors; however, she believes APTA is very beneficial for staff development and
professional growth. She stated RTD has training plans for staff but there do not seem to
be any for the Board. Chair Tobiassen suggested having the new Executive Manager do
some research into Board development programs around the metro area.

General Manager Genova stated he reviewed a report earlier in the day that showed daily
on-time performance is at 88%. He commented that there have been incidences in the
last week involving the overhead system which has caused delays, and DTP has taken
corrective action and is proactively reviewing the entire overhead system. He added that
there is a draft report that will summarize the significant delays DTP has had.
Director Folska explained that the University of Colorado A Line is concerning because it is
something that the District has been promoting in the state and the country as an example
of a successful public-private partnership (P3). She stated the risk of bad public relations,
whether or not on-time performance is 88%, is bad for RTD and the entire notion of P3
projects. She asserted that RTD needs to have emergency communications with
constituents.
Director Anderson stated she was very concerned as she is constantly receiving emails
about the unreliability of the University of Colorado A Line. She said that an 88% on-time
rate is good, unless you are on the 89th train that cannot make it to the airport on time.
She reiterated that it is incumbent on the Board and staff to make sure that people get to
their destinations on time. She thinks that RTD needs to address the public to do
something to change the entire paradigm.
Director Solano commented that he was on the University of Colorado A Line that got
stuck at the 38th and Blake station. He stated that another train was brought in and the
entire delay took 15 minutes or less. He noted that RTD and DTP need to have a
contingency plan in place for these issues.
Director Deadwyler stated that 88% sounds good, but it does not feel good. She added
that Security needs additional training, and commented that people flying in from other
places need to have a good experience on the train. She agreed with the other Directors
and said that there seems to be more and more down time with each delay.
Director Archuleta said a project of this magnitude is going to have problems. He brought
up the issues with DIA’s baggage carousel and noted it took time and money and it still
does not work. He stated that people are going to complain and he understands, but this
project will move forward and the issues will be fixed.

Director Folska thanked General Manager Genova for his report. She added that the Board
needs a frank conversation with staff regarding the University of Colorado A Line’s
challenges and how RTD is going to rescue its public relations.

8.A

General Manager Genova noted he has been with RTD for every line that has opened. He
stated that each line has had its own start up issues, such as the Southeast line’s weather
issues which required a few adjustments. He stated that he is not satisfied with the
current performance of the University of Colorado A Line, but it is a good project that
needs to be fine-tuned. He said that as issues are resolved, performance will improve.
Director Solano commented that in an election year, an issue as big as this can affect the
outcome. He said that RTD needs to be proactive and explain to the constituents what
the General Manager just stated. He remarked that the Board does not want the Directors
that have been doing a good job here to fall through the cracks in November.

XI.

Public Hearing for Amendment to 2016 Amended Budget
Chair Tobiassen called to order the Public Hearing for RTD’s Proposed Amendment to
Amended Budget for the year 2016. He indicated that in accordance with RTD's
requirements, notice of the public hearing was duly posted by the office of the Executive
Director to the Board of Directors at the Board approved notice location of 1600 Blake
Street. He added that a copy of the Proposed Amendment to Amended Budget for the
year 2016 is available for the public on request from the Board Office.
Chair Tobiassen noted that there were no speakers or questions relating to the Proposed
Amendment to Amended Budget for the year 2016 and asked for a motion to approve the
action item.
A.
Amendment to 2016 Amended Budget
It is recommended that the Board of Directors adopt Resolution No. ____, Series of
2016 to amend the 2016 Amended Budget for the Base System for the inclusion of
1) de-appropriation of debt, 2) reduction of estimated interest expense, 3) use of the
Board-Appropriated Fund, 4) use of the Capital Replacement Fund, 5) reduction to the
estimated unrestricted year-end fund balance; and amend the 2016 Amended Budget
for FasTracks Project for the inclusion of 1) reduction of budgeted operating expense,
2) reduction to the Board-Appropriated Fund, Capital Replacement Fund, and
estimated unrestricted year-end fund balance.
Revisions to appropriations in the Amended Budget that will affect the Base System
only are detailed as follows:

Director Lasater asked staff for a comparative analysis of the University of Colorado A Line
and B Line against the W Line so that the Board can get a better assessment of the current
failures.

8.A

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Aug 16, 2016 5:30 PM (Approval of Board Meeting Minutes of August 16, 2016)

1) De-appropriation of new financing proceeds of $50.0 million.
Originally appropriated in the 2016 Amended Budget, the
planned debt issuance for fleet purchases is rescinded to be
replaced by use of the Board-Appropriated Fund and Capital
Replacement Fund.
2) Reduction to estimated interest expense of $0.45 million. As a
result of #1 above, estimated interest expense will be reduced in
2016.
3) Reduction to Board-Appropriated Fund of $14.8 million. In place
of new financing proceeds, it is proposed that the BoardAppropriated Fund be reduced by $14.8 million to support
planned fleet purchases in 2016. Use of fund balances instead
of debt is necessary to preserve on-going debt service coverage.
Net of a previously scheduled contribution of $3.0 million to this
fund at year-end, the actual fund usage is $11.8 million.
4) Reduction to Capital Replacement Fund of $18.0 million. In
place of new financing proceeds, it is proposed that the Capital
Replacement Fund be reduced by $18.0 million to support
planned fleet purchases in 2016 in combination with #3 above.
Use of fund balances instead of debt is necessary to preserve ongoing debt service coverage. Net of a previously scheduled
contribution of $3.0 million to this fund at year-end, the actual
fund usage is $15.0 million.
5) Reduction to unrestricted fund balance of $1.4 million. As a
result of the above changes, the unrestricted fund balance is
projected to decline $1.4 million to $2.1 million at year-end
2016.
Other estimated (not appropriated) revisions to the 2016 Amended Budget affecting
the Base System include:
1) Increase to other income of $9.0 million. It is proposed that TABOR
reserves in the amount of $9.0 million be released in exchange for
providing the Blake building as collateral.
2) Increase to investment income of $0.39 million. A revision to estimated
investment income is made due to higher market interest rates.
Revisions to appropriations in the Amended Budget that will affect FasTracks Project
only are detailed as follows:

Packet Pg. 54

8.A

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Aug 16, 2016 5:30 PM (Approval of Board Meeting Minutes of August 16, 2016)

1) Reduction of $8.8 million in budgeted operating expense in Capital Programs.
This revision is necessary to correct a request made in the Amended Budget in
error which resulted in overstatement of budgeted operating expense in Capital
Programs of $8.8 million.
2) Reduction to Board-Appropriated Fund, Capital Replacement Fund, and
unrestricted fund balance of $0.5 million each. The reduction to each of these
funds is a direct result of the reduction to operating expense and is not a use
of these fund balances.
The result of these revisions is a decrease in the District-wide appropriation of $45.0
million to $2.299 million as summarized below from the attached Exhibit I.

Director Hoy noted that he had questions last week about the

are going in the future. He commented that he is not sure if
that means an IGA, but Westminster is interested in exploring
their options.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial, Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to enter into contract negotiations with Parsons
Corporation to retain this firm for work order-based cybersecurity consulting services to support
RTD’s cybersecurity program. The estimated cost of the Cybersecurity Services Work Order Contract
of $1,818,700 includes security risk assessment, technical testing, control design, and control
implementation activities and will be funded from the cybersecurity operations and maintenance
budget approved for 2016 forward. Actual expenditures will be based on work orders constructed
and issued by the cybersecurity project team, but are not to exceed the total budgeted for this
contract.
BACKGROUND
The Cybersecurity Manager and IT leadership require the support of a qualified subcontracting firm to
uncover and address security deficiencies and improve the sustainability of security controls within
RTD’s technology environment. RTD has identified cybersecurity as a priority for 2016 and onward,
and with good reason: assessments from 2014, 2015, and 2016 revealed that some of RTD’s
critical systems require some level of retrofit in order to secure them to the latest industry standards.
Designing and implementing ongoing, sustainable security controls that keep RTD’s technology
secure and well-monitored reduces the risk of operational disruptions that could result in loss of
service to our customers, reduces the risk of a breach of confidential information, and enhances the
overall safety and reliability of our system.
This work order contract will allow RTD to retain the services of a single security firm and their team
of technical consultants to assist with the implementation of RTD-defined cybersecurity projects.
Service categories included in the scope of the contract include:
 Security Risk Assessment
 Security Technical Testing (Vulnerability Testing or Penetration Testing)
 Security Control Design
 Security Control Implementation
Despite the best efforts of the onboard cybersecurity staff, RTD requires external assistance to fully
and effectively address control and compliance gaps that were identified in past years’ assessments
as well as continue to mature the cybersecurity program. The primary areas targeted for continued
assessment and enhancement, such as control systems and fare collection systems, employ
specialized technologies and/or are subject to regulatory compliance requirements. Security
assessment and control design in these areas requires the involvement of personnel with specific
certifications and expertise that RTD does not presently have on staff. Security control
implementation furthermore requires a full-time dedicated project team to make reasonable progress
in retrofitting security controls to our existing environments as well as to develop self-sustaining
systems and processes to ensure systems do not fall into disrepair.

Packet Pg. 65

11.A

Parsons can not only provide the required certified expertise, but also bring to bear the necessary
volume of technical resources needed to plan and implement security improvements in a timely
manner. Parsons’ staff will work in conjunction with and at the direction of RTD’s Cybersecurity
Manager and Senior IT Security Analyst to ensure their efforts align with RTD’s agency-wide, IT, and
cybersecurity objectives and that resulting processes and maintenance recommendations are
realistically executable by RTD’s current and future staff following the project closure.
DISCUSSION
The intent of the Cybersecurity Services Work Order Contract is to provide a vehicle to engage
skilled cybersecurity resources using an abbreviated procurement process (work orders) in order to
maintain the necessary engagement agility to meet the District’s needs with a firm with whom we
can build a consistent, sustained relationship anchored by our cybersecurity program objectives. Past
major assessments and security retrofits within the RTD technology environment, such as the
assessment and improvements to the fare collection environments, were individually contracted on a
project-by-project basis to outside firms. It was discovered through this experience that the general
Request for Proposal process was neither agile enough, nor was contractor engagement consistent
and sustained enough, for RTD to react in a timely manner to urgent security needs driven by
business problems or incidents, or to benefit holistically from security program improvements. The
work order process will allow us to collapse wait times and sustain program development efforts by
working with one pre-approved retained firm.
Following RTD’s Procurement process, the Information Technology department issued a Request for
Proposal to identify a qualified cybersecurity firm. A selection committee evaluated and identified the
best candidate, Parsons Corporation, to meet RTD’s needs. The proposed partnership would allow
RTD to retain Parsons for an initial period of two (2) years with an option to extend services for three
(3) individual years, for a total potential contract period of five (5) years. Given that this is a work
order contract, it will be RTD’s responsibility construct, issue, and negotiate individual work orders
with Parsons for specific security services over the course the engagement period.
The requested funds include tiered consultant staff hours (i.e. project manager, senior, specialist,
intermediate, and junior) that were estimated by RTD as needed to support RTD projects among the
aforementioned service categories at the time the proposal was drafted. Actual expenditures for the
engagement will be determined by the type, scope, and number of work orders issued by RTD and
vetted by Parsons, though they shall not exceed RTD’s total budgeted amounts.
It is worth noting that the current RTD cybersecurity team consists of the Cybersecurity Manager
and the recently added Senior IT Security Analyst, both reporting the Information Technology
department. This team will provide direction and leadership to the contracted consultants. It is
expected that as RTD’s internal cybersecurity resources increase, reliance on the external contracting
firm will decrease over time.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The total estimated cost of the Cybersecurity Services Work Order Contract, with options, is
$1,818,700. This amount bridges the five (5) year potential contract period. For 2016 and 2017,
$758,200 of the total amount (the base cost) was budgeted and approved for this purpose via the
Strategic Budget Planning process. Future years’ operating expenses will be reflected in future
years’ Strategic Budget Plan.

Packet Pg. 66

11.A

Any additional funding planned or anticipated to implement hardware or software improvements
recommended by the consultant technical team to improve security are separately budgeted in the
appropriate category (capital or expense) for 2017 forward.
ALTERNATIVES
The available alternatives include:
 Approve the work order contract with Parsons Corporation. This is the recommended action
to ensure that RTD has the immediately available and consistent support of a qualified
cybersecurity contractor to meet current and future needs.
 Increase internal cybersecurity staffing. At least five (5) immediate full time employees will be
required to fulfill the service and skill requirements that would otherwise be fulfilled by the
work order contract. While it is recommended that we augment the internal cybersecurity
team over time, foregoing services in favor of staffing is not the recommended action because
current employment market conditions may make it difficult to find qualified staff in the near
term, and our security improvement efforts will consequently be indefinitely delayed.
 Do not approve the contract with Parsons Corporation and do not increase cybersecurity
staffing (do nothing). This is not the recommended action because the onboard staff does not
currently have the human capacity to perform the identified security improvement work in a
timely, effective manner, and RTD requires specialized skill sets to complete some of the
necessary work.

Budget Transfer for SH 119 Bus Rapid Transit
Environmental Clearance and Basic Engineering

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: September 13, 2016
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: September 27, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors approve a transfer of $3.5 million from the Planning expense grant project budget to a new
capital project for the SH 119 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Corridor, which will permit staff to seek
consultant services for assistance in the preparation of National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)
review and Advanced Basic Engineering services. A total of $1.5 million in funding for this project
was approved in the 2016 Amended Budget in the Planning expense grant budget, and the remaining
funds are planned for 2017 and 2018 in the 2017-2022 Strategic Budget Plan (SBP).
BACKGROUND
RTD initiated the Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS), in April 2013. The purpose of the study
was to develop consensus among RTD, the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) and the
Northwest-area stakeholders, including local jurisdictions and businesses, on cost effective and
efficient mobility improvements to serve the Northwest area. On June 24, 2014, the Board approved
a resolution which accepted the Final Consensus Statement as developed by the NAMS stakeholders
for priorities within the Northwest Study Area. One of the highest priorities, as described in the
Final Consensus Statement, was to proceed into advanced planning, environmental clearance and
preliminary engineering to establish Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) in the SH 119 Corridor from Longmont
to Boulder.
As part of the 2040 Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) process, the Denver Regional Council of
Governments (DRCOG) included the SH 119 BRT Corridor in the Fiscally Constrained 2040 RTP.
Inclusion of the corridor in the RTP is required before National Environmental Planning Act (NEPA)
clearance can be completed.
In order to advance this effort, DRCOG awarded RTD $1 million in Congestion Mitigation / Air
Quality grant funds for Fiscal Year 2016 to further environmental planning and engineering efforts in
the corridor. RTD would need to obligate these funds by September 2017 or risk losing the funding
to another project.
The cost to establish BRT in the corridor is estimated to be approximately $57 million in 2013
dollars. Staff assumes that grants will provide funding for approximately half of this cost. The
Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) includes $60 million in Base System funds (with $30 million assumed to
be from grant sources) for construction of the corridor beginning in 2022.
This action fits within the General Manager Goal to Improve Service Delivery, specifically the sub
goal of enhancing or expanding operations, as the eventual completion of BRT in the SH 119 corridor
will increase service reliability, ridership and cost effectiveness of the service.

Packet Pg. 68

12.B

DISCUSSION
RTD will require extensive consultant services to complete the NEPA environmental clearances and
basic engineering prior to BRT construction in the SH 119 Corridor. Staff estimates those consultant
services to cost $3.5 million. RTD has received $1 million in DRCOG grant funds for Fiscal Year
2016 for this effort, with RTD providing the remainder of the project cost. Staff expects the effort
to span approximately 2.5 years, and these funds were programmed in the 2016 expense budget
and in the years 2017 and 2018 in the 2017-2022 SBP to match the anticipated project schedule.
However, the full contract amount must be appropriated up front in order to issue a Request for
Proposals (RFP) because the project is a capital project. The budget transfer will allow staff to issue
an RFP for consultant services in November 2016 and award the contract in February, 2017. Based
on the 2.5 year schedule described above, the environmental clearances and basic engineering would
be completed by July 2019.
Should RTD pursue BRT construction in this corridor, as prioritized by the NAMS Final Consensus
Statement, the SH 119 BRT project would be subject to approval by a two-thirds vote of the RTD
Board. In addition, DRCOG SB 208 approval would be required as this project would be defined as a
rapid transit corridor project. The expectation is that the funding breakdown for future BRT
construction in the corridor would be as follows:



50 percent from RTD Base System Funds; and
50 percent from grant sources, such as DRCOG Transportation Improvement Program (TIP)
funds, and/or Federal Transit Administration (FTA) Small Starts funding.

Project construction would occur within the 2022 to 2025 timeframe. And, as noted, future Board
action would be required to approve construction of BRT in this corridor.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The funding that will be used for this project is available from projects funds rolled forward from 2015 to
2016 that are no longer required for that purpose and are available for this priority. Because these funds
were programmed in 2017 and 2018 SBP, funds will be made available in those years by funding the
project now.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit
Committee that the RTD Board of Directors approve a transfer of $3.5 million from the
Planning expense grant project budget to a new capital project for the SH 119 Bus Rapid
Transit (BRT) Corridor, which will permit staff to seek consultant services for assistance in
the preparation of National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review and Advanced Basic
Engineering services. A total of $1.5 million in funding for this project was approved in the
2016 Amended Budget in the Planning expense grant budget, and the remaining funds are
planned for 2017 and 2018 in the 2017-2022 Strategic Budget Plan (SBP).
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not approve the requested budget transfer at
this time. Instead, include this request as part of the 2017 Recommended Budget. This
action is not recommended since it will delay the procurement of consultant services for the
SH 119 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) corridor by at least two months.
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not approve the requested budget transfer;
instead wait until the full $3.5 million for consultant services is available in 2018 on the
schedule included in the SBP. This action is not recommended since it would delay

Packet Pg. 69

12.B

procurement of consultant services for the SH 119 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) corridor until early
2018 and would likely delay future construction of the corridor, thereby subjecting
construction to cost escalation. This action would likely cause the forfeiture of the $1 million
in DRCOG TIP funds, which were awarded to advance the NEPA / Basic Engineering effort in
the corridor, which would increase RTD’s local funding required to advance the project.
4. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not approve the requested budget transfer and
do not proceed forward with procuring consultant services to assist staff in the preparation of
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review and Advanced Basic Engineering services for
the SH 119 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) corridor. This action is not recommended given the
considerable commitment on the part of RTD and the Northwest Area stakeholders to reach
the consensus prioritizing SH 119 as the highest-priority BRT corridor in the Northwest Area.
Furthermore, this action would require RTD to forfeit $1 million in DRCOG TIP funds, which
were awarded to advance the NEPA / Basic Engineering effort in the corridor.

2017-2022 Strategic Budget Plan (SBP)

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: September 13, 2016
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: September 27, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
adopts the 2017-2022 Strategic Budget Plan (SBP).
This action item meets policy requirements and the General Manager’s goals of Fiscal
Sustainability/Financial Plan by effecting current and long-range budgeting in a timely manner.
POLICY REFERENCE
Fiscal Policy Statement – Capital Improvement Policies 1, Budget Policies 13 and 14
BACKGROUND
Capital Improvement Policy 1 of RTD’s Fiscal Policy Statement states that “On an annual basis, RTD will
prepare and update annually a six-year Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) including projected capital
construction and improvements, service levels and operating costs, and revenues to fund the capital and
operating programs.”
The SBP is RTD’s six year financial plan. Updated annually, it provides important cash flow planning
information used to determine the District’s operating, investing and financing activity as well as
services that the District can provide using projected financial resources. The first year of the SBP
serves as the basis for the preparation of the annual budget.
Each year during the SBP process, operating costs are estimated and capital projects are developed to
support the goals and objectives of the District. Estimates of other expenditures, such as principal and
interest payments on long-term debt, are also developed as part of the overall costs to the District. The
other major component of the SBP is the estimate of available revenues during the six-year time period.
These estimates of costs and revenues are brought together to insure that RTD will have adequate
resources to meet cash flow needs.
Per RTD Fiscal Policy Statement, RTD will contract with a qualified third party to provide sales and use
tax forecasting containing projections for the short term (one year), medium term (SBP) and long term
(FasTracks APE). RTD has contracted with the University of Colorado-Leeds School of Business for this
service. See “sales and use tax” in Discussion below.
Capital and operating/maintenance projects are evaluated based on their relative costs and benefits,
relative need, and to what extent they meet the RTD mission statement; projects are constrained to
operate within the forecast of revenues and funding sources available for their completion and operation.

Packet Pg. 71

12.C

The SBP also provides the basis for the District’s application for federal transit funding through the
Transportation Improvement Program (TIP), prepared by the Denver Regional Council of Governments.
The TIP is a list of all roadway and transit projects in the region that receive federal funding. RTD
cannot receive federal funds for projects unless the qualifying SBP projects are included in the TIP.
The 2017-2022 SBP includes service and projects funded from the Base System 0.6% sales and use
taxes. Projected FasTracks future expense and projects for the period 2017-2022 are presented
separately in the FasTracks financial plan.
DISCUSSION
The attached SBP incorporates the 2016 amended budget and includes all known adjustments and best
estimates at this time. The SBP was presented to the Financial Administration and Audit Committee on
August 9th for discussion; final presentation follows on September 20th with staff recommendation for
Board adoption on September 27th.
Exhibit I
Exhibit I (attached) summarizes the 2017-2022 projected cash flow through the extension of the
2016 Amended Budget.
The column titled “Adjusted Amended Budget 2016” in Exhibit I
incorporates revenue and expense adjustments approved in the Amended Budget and by amendment
to the Amended Budget, and subsequent known items.
The SBP is balanced through the six year period after incorporating into the projections 1) the March
sales/use tax forecast from CU-Leeds School of Business, 2) minimum/must-have SBP requested
projects including minimum fleet requirements, 3) reductions, eliminations or deferrals of non-critical
SBP requested projects, 4) use of the Capital Acquisition reserve fund to support planned fleet
purchases, 5) restoration of reserve funds, and 6) no new debt issued. No service reductions are
proposed in the SBP through this period.
Exhibit I summarizes the 2017-2022 projected cash flow activity based on the staff recommendation
incorporating the following:
 Revenue estimates:
 Fare revenue of $117.5 million in 2017 is projected to be unchanged from 2016. The
year 2016 is budgeted to have an 8% fare revenue increase due to the fare rate
restructure and increase. Future fare revenue increases are planned for 2019 and 2022
per the Board policy of consideration of a 10% fare rate increase every 3 years. After
2016, which contains a 1.5% ridership increase, the SBP conservatively assumes no
increase in ridership through 2022. (Line 1)
 Sales and use tax incorporates the March semi-annual update from the CU-Leeds School of
Business for the years 2016-2022. The year 2016 is budgeted using the low growth
Below-Trend forecast and years 2017-2022 is projected using the medium growth
Baseline forecast. (Line 2)
o CU-Leeds presents probabilistic high and low forecast bounds in their forecasts that
incorporate possible errors, computed as 67% confidence bounds, meaning that a
0.67 probability exists that the interval between low and high forecast values will
contain the actual value of the variable being predicted. The upper bound estimate
is 6.8% higher than the medium baseline forecast. This shows that it is not
impossible or unrealistic that revenue could grow somewhat strongly over the next
2 years. Likewise, economic threats pose downside risk to the forecast with a
6.8% lower bound.

Packet Pg. 72

12.C



Grant revenue estimates are based upon past trends, formula allocations, known proceeds,
and recent congressional actions. Amounts are escalated at the area Consumer Price
Index (CPI) (obtained from Moody’s) or as identified. (Line 3)
 Other income consists of on-going advertising revenue, joint venture revenue, and IGA and
miscellaneous rental income, escalated at the CPI beginning in 2017. (Line 4)
 Operating expenses (excluding depreciation):
 Operating expenses are increased at area CPI rates and then adjusted for known items and
necessary reductions. The area CPI rates follow: (Line 6)
2017:
3.0%
2018:
3.1%
2019:
3.0%
2020:
2.7%
2021:
2.7%
2022:
2.7%
 Service increase consists of the cost of new CMAQ-funded service projects to be operated
by RTD in years 2016-2019 to include service enhancements on Routes L and 324, Route
73 extension, Superior and Broomfield call-n-Ride services, and Anschutz Medical Campus
Shuttle. These services are included in the DRCOG TIP. RTD costs will be reimbursed in
full by CMAQ grant funds and contributed funds from the applicable municipalities.
Determination will be made in future years whether to continue such service at RTD’s
cost. (Line 7)
 Costs of operating the West Line, DUS Bus Concourse, Free MetroRide I-225, the H-Line
extension and SERE are allocated from Base to FasTracks based on resource drivers on a
full-allocation basis in years 2017-2022, and thus, Base total expenses are reduced by the
amount of the allocation. In years prior to 2017, the allocation was made on an
incremental basis, to be changed to full allocation including administrative and support
costs beginning in 2017. (Line 8)
 Expenses include the Collective Bargaining Agreement at a negotiated amount through
2017 plus an adjustment at the CPI in to capture current higher costs, and then escalated
at the CPI rate for 2018-2022. (Line 9)
 Diesel fuel is forecast at an estimated lock price of $2.00/gallon in 2017 and then
escalated at the national CPI rates as follows: (Line 10)
2018:
3.0%
2019:
2.8%
2020:
2.5%
2021:
2.3%
2022:
2.3%
 Gasoline is forecast at $2.65/gallon in 2017 based on recent average prices plus an
upward adjustment, and then escalated at the national CPI rates above. (Line 10)
 In the line item for expense projects (O&M), the following are included: 1) specifically
identified minimum/must-have operating and maintenance projects (also termed “expense
projects”), detailed in Exhibit III, 2) an amount for new operating projects brought into the
SBP based on available cash flow; specific projects will be determined from the deferred
project list in Exhibit IV. (Line 11)
 The FasTracks service increase, or “rubber tire” service based on the 2004 FasTracks
Financial Plan whereby FasTracks will fund enhanced bus service on the Base System,
increases by the CPI rate serially each year. (Line 12)
 Interest income is based on current yields adjusted for expected changes in investable
balances and forecasted interest rates per forward rate curves. (Line 15)

Packet Pg. 73

12.C

 Interest expense is calculated by individual debt instruments outstanding during each year (for
current debt and future debt as applicable) by using debt amortization schedules. Interest
expense is forecast only on existing debt balances because the plan assumes no new debt
issued through 2022. (Line 16)
 In the line item for capital expenditures, the following are included: 1) specifically identified
minimum/must-have capital projects plus the minimum required new fleet, detailed in Exhibit
II; dollar amounts of the new fleet will be determined so as not to exceed cash flow
constraints determined in the SBP model, 2) an amount for new capital projects brought into
the SBP based on available cash flow; specific projects will be determined from the deferred
project list in Exhibit IV, and 3) COP- or bond-funded carry-forward capital expenditures. (Line
19)
 The Fiscal Policy Statement establishes a Board-appropriated fund and capital replacement
fund.
 Staff recommends that funding of the Board-appropriated fund be maintained at a
minimum of $3 million each year until the fund reaches a balance of $35 million, projected
to occur in 2021. (Lines 20 and 33)
 Staff recommends that the capital replacement fund be refunded nominally to $2.7 million
in 2017 per available cash flow, used in years 2018-2020 for fleet purchases, then
replenished to $20 million in 2021 and the entire balance used to support fleet
expenditures in 2022. Per the 2016 Amended Budget, the capital replacement fund was
used in its entirety in 2016 for fleet acquisition. (Lines 21 and 34)
 The Fiscal Policy Statement in Fund Balance Policy 4 allows for the designation of an
unrestricted operating fund used to respond to unanticipated events, including revenue
shortfalls. The unrestricted operating reserve is established in 2017 and funded with available
cash flow. The plan will apply available dollars toward the operating fund so it reaches a
minimum $25 million in 2020, and reaches $46.4 million in 2022. (Lines 22 and 35)
 The Board-appropriated fund and unrestricted operating reserve fund (and not the capital
acquisition fund) in total are projected to reach $81.4 million in 2022.
 A placeholder is established for Transfer to FasTracks for Base System support of FasTracks
operations. Any transfer to FasTracks is not expected to occur until after 2022. (Line 23)
 Financing proceeds represent COPs issued for bus and light rail vehicle acquisition in
accordance with fleet schedules, net of grant funding and use of capital acquisition fund. No
new debt is issued during the SBP term in order to maintain required debt service coverage.
(Line 25)
 Principal payments on debt are derived from individual debt instruments outstanding during
each year (for current debt and future debt as applicable) by using debt amortization
schedules. Principal payments are forecast only on existing debt balances. (Line 26)
 Other line items consist of the roll-over of the unrestricted fund ending balance at 12/31/15,
estimated changes to restricted reserves, and the use of previously-issued COP-bond proceeds
for future year capital expenditures. (Lines 29, 30, and 31)
 The SBP is balanced during the six-year period as shown by the positive unrestricted year-end
fund balance. The objective is to maintain a nominal unrestricted year-end fund balance of $2
million each year through 2022 while supporting a minimum critical level of capital and
expense projects and building reserve fund balances. (Line 32)

As required by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), RTD must review its SBP for any Title VI
impacts (disproportionate impacts on minority and low income communities). Any service changes
specified in the SBP will be reviewed for Title VI impacts during the service planning process prior to
final recommendations on service changes. For the capital component of the SBP, Title VI impacts are
reviewed on improvements that are over and above the state-of-good-repair elements (repairs,
replacements and rehabilitations) of the capital program. The Title VI review will be provided and a
statement from the Planning Department to this effect is attached.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The staff-recommended SBP provides RTD with a plan for maintaining a positive unrestricted year-end
fund balance in each year of the SBP while substantially growing reserve fund balances. However,
uncontrollable economic factors, such as sales tax revenue, cost of fuel, materials, and supplies, as well

12.C

1. Adoption of the 2017-2022 SBP, incorporating all items currently in the recommendation by staff and
the other items identified above. This is the recommended action.
2. Defer the adoption of a 2017-2022 SBP to a later date. This is not recommended because the SBP
identifies the capital programs, expenditures, and service guidelines for the 2017 budget process and
adoption of the SBP serves as a confirmation of the Board of Directors' vision for the 2017 Budget.
3. Provide staff additional direction in the selection of assumptions for the projected 2017-2022 SBP.
This is not the desired action and will result in delay of the SBP adoption and possible delay in the
2017 budget process.

In 2013, Rail Operations and the Planning Department
Districtwide
determined that eighteen (18) Light Rail Vehicles (LRVs)
would need to be purchased in order to meet the demands of
the existing LRT system and accommodate the opening of the
I-225 line in 2016. This analysis led to the current
procurement of twelve (12) vehicles that was included in the
2015-2017 capital budget plan. In order to bring the spare
ratio to a desired 20% minimum and meet the anticipated
growth in ridership, we need to purchase seventeen (17)
additional vehicles by 2020 (2 will be purchased by
FasTracks). This will increase the fleet from 184 to 201. The
order for these vehicles was placed in 2015.

In the years of 2016 and 2017, RTD will receive a FASTER
grant stipend from CDOT for State of Good Repair type
projects. These funds will be used to fund RTD projects that
would otherwise have been funded by RTD Base system
funds. However, as part of this stipend, CDOT expects RTD to
provide an additional $150,000 of grants to local governments
for transit projects. The funds from this SBP request will be
added to the SBP Local Government pool so that RTD can
meet the terms of the FASTER stipend and have a meaningful
pool of funds to respond to local government requests.

Computer data storage, often called storage or memory, is a
technology consisting of computer components and recording
media used to retain digital information. It is a core function
and fundamental component of computers. The central
processing unit (CPU) of a computer is what manipulates raw
information by performing computations. In practice, almost
all computers use a storage hierarchy, which puts fast but
expensive and small storage options close to the CPU and
slower but larger and cheaper options farther away.
In computing, a portfolio of storage products, including online
storage, near-online (nearline) storage, storage networking,
archiving, de-duplication, storage and backup software are
required to run the Enterprise.

Office
our riders in timely manner. The system will include a webbased interface that allows staff to create and manage the
thousands of service alerts that are sent out each year. The
Alert System will be intuitive and fast to use, allowing simple
alerts to be created in seconds. At the same time, the system
will offer fine-grained control over selecting the specific route,
branch, trip, or stop an alert applies to, when an alert is in
effect, and by what channels (like emails, text messages,
electronic signs, agency website, General Transit Feed
Specification real-time feeds and third party apps) the alerts
should be disseminated. The system will use templates to
automatically generate appropriate messages for all the
dissemination channels.

Mobile Ticketing

This project is a GM initiative to enhance fare products by
Blake Street
offering a mobile application for the purchase and use of fare Office
and parking products. Mobile ticketing applications are
available from many third parties and can be used on any
mobile device. There is very little need for infrastructure or
customization of software. A user simply downloads the
mobile ticketing application to their device and purchases and
manages any of RTD's fare products or pays for parking. The
user purchases the product needed with a credit card and
receives the value of their payment on their mobile device for
immediate use. The user then activates (validates) each ride
by simply selecting the fare product to be used each time a
boarding occurs. The mobile application vendor maintains the
software and is the administrator of payments thereby
meeting PCI compliance. Any of RTD's fare products may be
used with mobile ticketing which offers a single, convenient
source and use of products. The vendor manages the data
and payments and sends a single payment for all transactions
during a given time period to RTD. Vendors also provide data
and analytical tools regarding the transactions on the
application. Industry standards for cost structure are an initial
small set-up fee then a % of mobile ticketing sales.

CCTV Retrofit on LRV

This project is requested to replace 189 LRV CCTV recorders Districtwide
and cameras that have surpassed their useful lives and install
new system configuration. This retrofit has been designed to
match CCTV systems that are currently specified within the
new bus orders for standardization. These modern systems
also provide the ability to remotely retrieve video from the
Security Command Center. Installation includes a complete
removal of old analog systems and re-wiring to work with new
digital technology. This includes new mobile network video
server/recorder, high definition cameras, mobile network
switches, and mobile routers. In addition, the LRVs are to be
outfitted with forward facing and cab operation cameras to aid
in the investigations of accidents. Forward facing cameras will
assist by providing information as to the status of signals,
switches and crossings as vehicles move along the rail
system. This request is to provide funding to complete the
upgrades over a period of 5 years.

This project will include all of the downtown track and
Central Rail Line
infrastructure from 7th street to 30th and Downing. This
alignment is 22 years old and has been in service since
inception. For the most part this infrastructure has reached its
potential lifespan. There are several projects in place to make
repairs and replace the worst of the defects but an overall
plan is needed to replace all track, turnout switches, street
crossings, concrete flat work, etc. Please see the attached
report from MOW and SGR, highlighting the condition of the
infrastructure in the area. This is a six year plan. The
alignment will be divided into segments that can be
completely refurbished within the span of one construction
season. Our estimates are at a cost of $2,000,000 per year
for 6 years.
Many of the existing metal halide, glow top, pole light fixtures Southwest Rail
in the pedestrian areas on 12’ poles have been damaged from Line
hail over the past 3 to 4 years. The fixture is obsolete and the
lenses are not made any longer. Replacement will be made
with LED fixtures.

Request is to proceed with the Colfax Avenue Transit Priority Colfax - East Project. RTD has received a Federal Ladders of Opportunity ITS
grant to fund a capital project to reduce travel time and
increase security and ridership for 15L bus route. The project
includes: stop amenity improvements (repair and replace
existing amenities, lighting, shelters, security cameras), bus
bulbs at a few locations, transit signal priority (TSP), and
bypass lanes/queue jumps. The project includes East Colfax
from Broadway east to Potomac (near I-225). It is important to
note that from Yosemite to Potomac, the project will only
include improved stop amenities. RTD's remaining local

Bus Rapid Transit @ SH Project is to construct approximately 18 miles of Bus Rapid
Transit (BRT) in the SH 119 Corridor to connect Boulder and Line
119
Longmont in accordance with the recommendation of the
Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS). It is anticipated that
approximately half of the total costs for this project would be
grant-funded. The establishment of BRT in the corridor would
raise ridership from approximately 1,900 to approximately
5,000 daily weekday riders in 2035. Detailed cost estimates
and design will be established through the upcoming
environmental clearance study and preliminary engineering,
previously approved in the SBP. The project is anticipated to
take two years to construct.

Property Survey
Records System-Wide

Currently whenever RTD acquires or disposes off any
Districtwide
property right (fee simple, easement, or license agreement), it
utilizes an external survey firm (Jacobs) to establish the
location of that property right on the ground, and prepare
Right-of-Way maps, legal descriptions and exhibits. The
contract with Jacobs will expire at the end of 2016. Jacobs
has surveys, Computer Aided Design (CAD) files, information
on adjoining properties, subdivision plats, ALTA surveys, legal
descriptions, and other electronic and paper records
regarding RTD properties going back to 1997. The extent of
this information is estimated to be 2 to 4 terabytes, which
could be equated to 76,000 to 152,000 bankers boxes of
information. These documents also include information on
utilities that cross or service RTD stations, rail lines, Park-nRides, and other properties.

This project is to sort through Jacobs property survey records,
bring this information within RTD, and organize it on an
engineering GIS platform. Initially, the system will house
information on properties, utilities, track, pnRs, crossings, and
structures. The system can be expanded to include other
items such as catenary system. The property survey
information is critical to the system and needs to be brought
within RTD. This project will strengthen the foundation of
many District-wide efforts by obtaining and organizing RTD
property rights, utility, and other information in an easily

Project Description

DRCOG, through the Transportation Improvement Program
Districtwide
(TIP), has allocated $1 million in funding for FY 2017 for this
project. RTD would be required to provide a 25 percent local
match of $250,000. Given the results of the Northwest Area
Mobility Study, which showed substantial bus ridership
increases from modest capital improvements made to arterial
corridors, there has been much interest from other areas of
the District for RTD to make arterial BRT investments in other
corridors. The purpose of this study will be to examine the
potential for arterial BRT investments throughout the entire
District and prioritize for future capital investment those
corridors which perform the highest.

The ADA Manager continues to boost involvement on
accessible design (plan reviews, site visits, and inspections)
District-wide. The need for a perspective on accessible design
has been well received and needs more and continued
attention and support. This proactive approach ensures
compliance and mitigates potential problems. This
effort/involvement has been effective in identifying and
preventing costly and litigious issues from escalating, but
efforts are spread thin and not all projects receive this type of
attention.
Currently whenever RTD acquires or disposes off any property Districtwide
right (fee simple, easement, or license agreement), it utilizes
an external survey firm (Jacobs) to establish the location of
that property right on the ground, and prepare Right-of-Way
maps, legal descriptions and exhibits. The contract with
Jacobs will expire at the end of 2016. Jacobs has surveys,
Computer Aided Design (CAD) files, information on adjoining
properties, subdivision plats, ALTA surveys, legal
descriptions, and other electronic and paper records regarding
RTD properties going back to 1997. The extent of this
information is estimated to be 2 to 4 terabytes, which could be
equated to 76,000 to 152,000 bankers boxes of information.
These documents also include information on utilities that
cross or service RTD stations, rail lines, Park-n-Rides, and
other properties.
Organizations that have assets in various geographic
locations typically utilize Geographic Information Systems
(GIS) to record and analyze their asset base. Utilities and local
municipalities are examples of such organizations. RTD has
been using GIS systems for about 15 years. Currently, these
systems are used mostly used by the Telephone Information
Center (TIC), Scheduling (Transtar), and CAD/AVL. RTD is
also getting started on projects like real-time train arrival
information, which would also need GIS support.

In November 2015, the Board approved a contract with IQBG
to serve as the owner's representative for ECM
implementation. The scope of the IQBG contract starts with
development of the background and requirements for ECM
implementation, including policies and procedures, consistent
taxonomy (named) and metadata structure (data definitions),
and functional and technical requirements and capabilities.
Based on these requirements, IQBG will develop
recommendations for a path forward, which is scheduled to be
approved in September 2016. Procurement of the
recommended alternative would begin in the fourth quarter of
2016.

Information Storage Unit RTD relies heavily on its storage units to house 95% of all
District information and computing services. A wide range of
Replacement
departments and applications use these storage units to store
mission-critical data.
Computer data storage, often called storage or memory, is a
technology consisting of computer components and recording
media used to retain digital information. It is a core function
and fundamental component of computers. The central
processing unit (CPU) of a computer is what manipulates raw
information by performing computations. In practice, almost all
computers use a storage hierarchy, which puts fast but
expensive and small storage options close to the CPU and
slower but larger and cheaper options farther away.
In computing, a portfolio of storage products, including online
storage, near-online (nearline) storage, storage networking,
archiving, de-duplication, storage and backup software are
required to run the Enterprise.

Communications is looking to implement a Rider Alert System Blake Street
in order to communicate up-to-the-minute service alerts for our Office
riders in timely manner. The system will include a web-based
interface that allows staff to create and manage the thousands
of service alerts that are sent out each year. The Alert System
will be intuitive and fast to use, allowing simple alerts to be
created in seconds. At the same time, the system will offer finegrained control over selecting the specific route, branch, trip,
or stop an alert applies to, when an alert is in effect, and by
what channels (like emails, text messages, electronic signs,
agency website, General Transit Feed Specification real-time
feeds and third party apps) the alerts should be disseminated.
The system will use templates to automatically generate
appropriate messages for all the dissemination channels.
The Alert System will include a web-based interface that is
used by staff to create and manage service alerts. Key
features of the interface will include:
● General:
○ Integration with RTD website, email communications, text
communications, etc.
○ Intuitive and fast-to-use interface
○ Differentiation between detour, disruption, emergency,
service change, event detour, etc.
○ Ability to send out stop, route, branch, trip alerts

This project is a GM initiative to enhance fare products by
Blake Street
offering a mobile application for the purchase and use of fare Office
and parking products. Mobile ticketing applications are
available from many third parties and can be used on any
mobile device. There is very little need for infrastructure or
customization of software. A user simply downloads the
mobile ticketing application to their device and purchases and
manages any of RTD's fare products or pays for parking. The
user purchases the product needed with a credit card and
receives the value of their payment on their mobile device for
immediate use. The user then activates (validates) each ride
by simply selecting the fare product to be used each time a
boarding occurs. The mobile application vendor maintains the
software and is the administrator of payments thereby meeting
PCI compliance. Any of RTD's fare products may be used with
mobile ticketing which offers a single, convenient source and
use of products. The vendor manages the data and payments
and sends a single payment for all transactions during a given
time period to RTD. Vendors also provide data and analytical
tools regarding the transactions on the application. Industry
standards for cost structure are an initial small set-up fee then
a % of mobile ticketing sales.

RTD needs technology to operate efficiently and to compete
Civic Center
effectively. But as reliance on IT grows, the resources needed Plaza (CCP)
to support this increasingly complex IT environment may not.
In many areas, IT resources are limited and can be quickly
overwhelmed. We have seen from prior instances that if we
fall behind in keeping up with things such as backups, patches
and security, the odds greatly increase that RTD will face an
IT outage or another problem down the road that will
negatively impact RTD business. For instance, once RTD rolls
out real-time information to the customer and we have an
outage, it will negatively impact customers' view of RTD.
Another example is constantly keeping up to date with security
patches which, if not applied, will leave security vulnerabilities
open in the system. Managed Services support will help IT to
keep current with all these patches on a regular basis.

With the expansion of staff, represented employees, vehicles

hiring new qualified mechanics, a robust training program is
essential. Part of this program needs to incorporate an ELearing system such as what Xpan offers (see attachment)
that is all-encompassing plus specific to the diagnostic details
of the SD160 fleet the we own. It can also aid in filling the gap
between an unqualified mechanic helper to an electromechanic.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

From:

Heather
Copp,

Date:

September 12, 2016

Subject:

Discussion and Action of the 2016 Annual
Program Evaluation (APE) and Financial Plan

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: September 13, 2016
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: September 27, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors adopts the 2016 Annual Program Evaluation (APE) and Financial Plan as outlined below.
BACKGROUND
RTD has been conducting an Annual Program Evaluation since 2007. Given the challenges of managing
a multi-billion dollar capital program, it is desirable to perform a complete analysis of the cost of the
program. The APE captures all project expenditures to date and all planned expenditures through the
year 2019 on a project-by-project basis. It essentially provides a baseline capital budget for boardapproved projects currently underway or planned in the near future.
Since most of the funded FasTracks projects are complete or under construction, the major effort of the
APE has shifted from developing accurate estimates of costs to one of managing the projects within the
Board-approved budgets for those projects and ensuring that RTD will have the future financial capacity
to operate the corridors and meet its debt service obligations. Therefore, the FasTracks financial plan
provides an overall long-term financial plan for RTD, and includes forecasts for both FasTracks and the
base system through 2040. The staff provides the Board with regular updates on the FasTracks projects
throughout the year.
DISCUSSION
The project-by-project cost along with the amount spent through 2015 is shown in the attached
presentation. The total FasTracks budget through 2019 is approximately $5.6 billion, and approximately
$4.3 billion of this total was spent through the end of 2015.
Since most of the funded FasTracks projects are complete or under construction and are being managed
within the Board approved budgets, the project cost changes to this APE are relatively small. The
changes primarily reflect updates to project scope and timing, or work that has been completed under
budget, as shown on the attached presentation (Attachment A).
The project cost changes for the 2016 APE are summarized below:





Changes to the timing and project scope for the US 36 BRT:
o Funding for BRT vehicle enhancements deferred from 2018 until 2030 to coincide with
the replacement of the current bus fleet
o Deferral of the Church Ranch platform relocation
o Addition of additional vertical circulation at the Broomfield station, to be completed by
2018
Increase in unit cost for the additional light rail vehicles
Additional funds required for project closeout staffing

Packet Pg. 102

12.D







Projects with environmental and planning work completed under the 2015 APE budget:
o Northwest Rail Segment 2
o Southwest Corridor Extension
o Central Corridor Extension
Other projects completed under the APE budget:
o Existing Corridor Improvements (Southeast, Central, CPV)
o Railroad ROW
o Communication System Upgrades
o Northeast Area Transportation Evaluation (NATE)
Reduction in program wide capital costs

Future implementation of projects not included in the current APE would require identification of funding
sources for construction and operations, and would require approval of the Board. Therefore, the APE is
a dynamic tool, which is updated as projects move towards completion and any changes approved by
the Board are incorporated.
The FasTracks financial plan incorporates updated revenue forecasts that show a decrease in short and
medium-term revenue forecasts for both FasTracks and the base system. With these updated forecasts,
annual revenues are projected to be lower than the 2015 APE forecasts in each year through 2025. In
addition, the total cumulative revenue forecast is lower than the 2015 APE forecast through 2034.
Between 2035 and 2040, total forecast revenues are projected to be higher than the 2015 forecast.
This reduced revenue forecast is expected to have multiple impacts on the financial plan. RTD’s net
debt service coverage is expected to be close to the 1.20x Board policy limit through 2022. As a result,
once the remaining FasTracks debt approved in May 2016 is issued, RTD will not have the capacity to
issue additional bonds or Certificates of Participation (COPs) until 2023.
In 2012, the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) was established and “all funding identified
through the process will be added to the FISA until enough funding is accumulated to complete and
operate additional projects.” In addition to completing and operating additional projects, the specific
project goals of the FISA were to:
 Complete the US 36 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Project:
 Construct North Metro to at least 72nd;
 Any remaining funds above the $300 million goal could leverage potential grants or private sector
contributions for FasTracks partially funded projects (at the RTD Board’s discretion)
However, in 2021 through 2024 all FISA funds available will be needed to fund FasTracks corridor
operations and maintenance. In 2024 through 2030 base system funding is also needed to fund
FasTracks operations and maintenance. After 2030, FasTracks revenues are projected to cover all
operations and maintenance of the FasTracks corridors. At that time, positive fund balances begin to
accumulate on both the base system and FasTracks, with the larger share accumulating on the base
system.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The project cost changes in the 2016 Annual Program Evaluation are projected to result in a total cost
savings of $14.7 million. Approximately $1.2 million of these savings will be offset by the loss of a
CDOT FASTER grant for the Church Ranch platform relocation. The net savings of $13.5 million will be
restored to the FISA between 2016 and 2018.

After listening to input from the Board and stakeholder, the staff recommended option is the modified
baseline option. It is listed below (See Attachment B).








Need to take a total of $130.8 million from the base system in 2024-2030 to balance FasTracks
Issue COPs in base system in 2023 for $59.2 million for bus purchases. All other base capital
expenditures through 2040 are pay-go
Build Board appropriated and operating reserves in base systems to maintain equivalent of 3
months of operating reserves consistently through 2040
FISA is utilized to fund FasTracks operations and maintenance in years 2021-2024
Keep FasTracks reserves equivalent to 3 months O&M
As FasTracks unrestricted balances start to accumulate in 2031, those balances are transferred
to the FISA. No balances are transferred in years 2038 or 2039 as funds are need to fund
FasTracks EIS commitments
At year-end 2040, Base System unrestricted fund balance is projected to be $1,317.2 million,
FISA is projected to be $518.1 million, and FasTracks unrestricted fund balance is projected to be
$21.5 million for a total projected balance of $1,856.8 million

Funding from the FISA and FasTracks unrestricted fund balances would be used to fund the remaining
unfunded FasTracks corridors which have not been prioritized.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Adoption of the 2016 APE and Financial Plan, incorporating the recommendation by staff.
This is the recommended action.
2. Adoption of the 2016 APE and Financial Plan, incorporating the original baseline
recommendation by staff. This is not the recommendation action.
3. Defer the adoption of the 2016 APE and Financial Plan to a later date. This is not the
recommendation action. The financial plan must be adopted by the Board in September in
order to deliver the financial plan to the rating agencies. The rating agencies require the
financial plan in order to issue bond ratings to RTD. Those ratings are required for our
upcoming bond sale in October. Delaying approval would delay the bond sale, which could
lead to an undesirable cash position.
