## IV. Retiree Awards

## V. Public Participation

Chair Tobiassen stated public participation was open to anyone that wanted to address the Board.  He reminded the audience that each speaker is allowed three minutes.

- George Gerstle, Boulder, indicated he was the Transportation Director for Boulder County.  He said Boulder County appreciates that RTD remains committed to funding of the SH119 BRT; the highest priority BRT corridor agreed to in the RTD Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS) consensus agreement. He added that Boulder County also understands RTD is having the fiscal challenges associated with lower than projected sales tax revenues and higher than projected costs for the FasTracks system.  He added that Boulder County appreciates and supports staff’s recent recommendation to retain the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) in order to demonstrate a commitment to complete the FasTracks program. He remarked that the elimination of the FISA would preclude completion of the remaining unfunded portions of the FasTracks system until 2030 or beyond.  He urged the Board to take a more gradual approach to re-filling depleted reserve accounts in order to mitigate the immediate impact of the proposed redirection of funding and commit to deposit any FasTracks related revenue received over the forecast revenue in the FISA account in order to demonstrate RTD commitment to the completion of FasTracks.  He stated Boulder County was also very concerned with the proposed redirection of the vast majority of any new base system operating revenue to FasTracks operations and maintenance starting in the early 2020’s. He said that such an action would eliminate increases in nonFasTracks service necessary to address the region’s growing population that relies on the base system RTD bus service and it would eliminate the possibility of any significant future growth in bus service for the next decade, or longer and it will have a disproportionate impact on the region’s residents not currently served by FasTracks.  He remarked that zeroing out funding in FISA combined with the proposed use of additional revenue growth in base system funds to subsidize FasTracks operations seems to eliminate any opportunity to complete FasTracks and any opportunity to expand non-FasTracks service necessary to meet the regions’ growing population for more than a decade by the proposed action.  He further stated that our citizens expect us, as leaders of the metro region, to work together to come up with reasonable political and financial solutions to complete the FasTracks system the voters approved in 2004, without sacrificing the base bus system that so many people rely on.  Boulder County does not believe it is acceptable to our residents to wait at least another decade for completion of FasTracks, or to forgo any substantial growth in the base bus system service in order to funds operations of the current FasTracks system.  He added that Boulder County stands committed to work with RTD to resolve this difficult situation.

- Doug Gragg said that it has been two months since he has spoken in front of the Board.  He stated on July 4th, he was riding the H Line south, to the Broadway station.  He remarked that he was hassled by juveniles for money and feeling that he had no other alternatives, he gave them what he had.  He said that the train came to a sudden stop and the train operator came out of the Operator’s cab and demanded that the juveniles return the money they had taken.  Mr. Gragg said that the operator, Lorenzo Johnson did an excellent job of looking out for, and taking care of an older person who felt threatened.

- Véronique Bellamy, Longmont, recommended that RTD develop a customer ticket system to resolve complaints.  She said people call the Call Center with their issues, but they do not know what RTD is doing to address their concerns.  She stated RTD needs to update its IT software to an Application Program Interface (API).  She added that she still has four Colorado Open Records Act (CORA) requests that have yet to be fulfilled and the API could address her requests in a timely manner.  Lastly, she recommended that Director Bagley re-introduce his motion to have the RTD Board and Committee meetings recorded for transparency.

- Wayne Graham, Denver, said that the City of Denver has a noise ordinance which requires lower noise levels from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m.  He said that trains depart Union Station for Denver International Airport (DIA) beginning at 3:15 a.m. and the trains have to cross through multiple streets all the while blowing a loud horn.  He recommended that RTD run busses along the University of Colorado A line from 10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. until the quiet zone certifications are completed.

- Karen Stuart, Broomfield, indicated she was here tonight to represent the North Area Transportation Alliance (NATA).  She said that NATA appreciates staff’s recommendation to retain the FISA under the modified base scenario in order to demonstrate a commitment to FasTracks.  However, she said that the Board needs to seek alternatives that retain the existing funds and increase the FISA for the construction of FasTracks.  She remarked that it was not acceptable to residents to wait two more decades for the completion of FasTracks as it will likely be cost-prohibitive to complete any additional corridors in 2040.  She asked the Board not to approve the 2016 Annual Program Evaluation (APE), but if they did, she asked that they go on the record noting their concerns and desire to complete FasTracks by 2022.  She asked that staff:

1.       Begin working with affected jurisdictions with unfunded FasTracks corridors to develop viable segments along corridors that can be built between now and 2022;

2.       Involve local jurisdictions early to work together on the 2017 APE; and

3.       Commit any FasTracks revenues that exceed the projected forecasts to be put into the FISA account for construction in order to truly demonstrate RTD’s commitment to complete FasTracks.

She said the Board needs to demonstrate to the region that RTD has not given up and asked that the Board vote “no” on the 2016 APE, or “yes” with strong concerns and direct staff to proceed with the three points outlined above.

- Erik Hansen, Adams County, said that he sympathizes with the Board because often people complain, but they do not offer any alternative solutions.  He asked the Board not to approve the APE tonight as RTD made a commitment to the voters to complete FasTracks.  He remarked that RTD should evaluate service levels and examine alternatives.

- Barry Gore, Adams County, asked the Board to vote against the APE and to keep the funds in the FISA account.  He said that the Board made very difficult decisions in 2012, and if RTD were to remove the FISA it would kill off any private partnerships and unsolicited proposals.  He remarked that the metro Denver area is well known internationally, and it would be tragic for FasTracks to get a black eye.  He stated that this decision does not need to be made tonight, and he asked staff to re-evaluate all of the alternatives.

### A. 2016-014 : Enter Contract to Purchase Cybersecurity Consulting Services

It is recommended by the Financial, Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to enter into contract negotiations with Parsons Corporation to retain this firm for work order-based cybersecurity consulting services to support RTD’s cybersecurity program. The estimated cost of the Cybersecurity Services Work Order Contract of $1,818,700 includes security risk assessment, technical testing, control design, and control implementation activities and will be funded from the cybersecurity operations and maintenance budget approved for 2016 forward.  Actual expenditures will be based on work orders constructed and issued by the cybersecurity project team, but are not to exceed the total budgeted for this contract.

### B. Budget Transfer for SH 119 Bus Rapid Transit Environmental Clearance and Basic Engineering

It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors approve a transfer of $3.5 million from the Planning expense grant project budget to a new capital project for the SH 119 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Corridor, which will permit staff to seek consultant services for assistance in the preparation of National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review and Advanced Basic Engineering services.  A total of $1.5 million in funding for this project was approved in the 2016 Amended Budget in the Planning expense grant budget, and the remaining funds are planned for 2017 and 2018 in the 2017-2022 Strategic Budget Plan (SBP).

Motion:               Director Sisk made a motion to approve the Budget Transfer for SH 119 Bus Rapid Transit Environmental Clearance and Basic Engineering

Director Deadwyler seconded the motion.

Director Lubow moved to table this motion.  She said that she would feel more comfortable if the Board knew FasTracks would be constructed.  She said one suggestion would be if any financial overages went into the FISA account.  She asked to move this item to a date certain, to the October, 18th Financial Administration and Audit Committee.

Rolf Asphaug, General Counsel, stated this item cannot go back down to a committee, and must be moved to a future Board Meeting.

Chair Tobiassen called Director Lubow’s motion out of order and asked for a new motion.

### E. Discussion and Action of the 2016 Annual Program Evaluation (APE) and Financial Plan

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors adopts the 2016 Annual Program Evaluation (APE) and Financial Plan as outlined below.

Motion:               Director Deadwyler made the motion to approve the 2016 Annual Program Evaluation (APE) and Financial Plan.

Director Bagley seconded the motion.

Director Hoy stated he would be voting against this item.  He said he still has concerns about this and requested that staff have further discussions with stakeholders in the north.

Director Lubow said she too would be voting against this item.  She remarked that she represents an unfunded corridor and it seems that the unfunded corridors are asked to bear the burden of the financial decisions that benefit the rest of the district.  She added that she appreciated Commissioner Hensen’s suggestions to look for alternative funding.

Chair Tobiassen asked Heather Copp to speak to the Board regarding this item.

Heather Copp, Chief Financial Officer and Assistant General Manager of Finance and Administration, said if the Board did not pass this item tonight, staff will have to cancel the Certificates of Participation (COP’s) next month.  She added that staff will have an issue with being able to issue bonds, and staff would have difficulty paying the bills for the rest of the year.  She noted that all of the current projects be slowed down because she would not be able to pay the bills.

Henry Stopplecamp, Assistant General Manager of Capital Programs and Facilities added that if the APE is not passed, RTD would have to extend all of its contracts, which would cost the Agency more money.

Rolf Asphaug, General Counsel, stated an affirmative vote of 8 is required to pass this item.

Director Bagley said if conversations are to be had, they need to include every corridor.  He added that the FISA account is not just for the north, and everyone needs to understand that.  He remarked that the modified baseline scenario does not close the FISA account, but it utilizes the money.

Director Folska commented that she agrees with Director Bagley.  She appreciates everything she’s heard tonight, but delaying issuing bonds would be a huge setback for the district.  She believes FasTracks can be finished by 2020 and asked the General Manger to provide his assurances that alternative funding will be sought and asked that the passenger/freight relationship be examined further.

Director James commented that it would be unfair to treat any corridor with any priority over the others.  He said he understands staffs concerns about the disruption if this is not passed, so he would be voting yes.

Director Walker said he would be supporting this motion.  He said the entire Board is committed to completing every corridor, but we must support the whole system.  He remarked that maintaining the viability of the system and paying debts is the most important.

Director Deadwyler said if this is voted down, that means we will not be paying our contractors.  She remarked that she cannot support this.

Director Sisk commented that the Board needs to challenge staff to examine alternative funding sources.

Chair Tobiassen said if this item were to be voted down, it would severely impact RTD’s services.  He remarked that this is a business decision because of the potential harm it could cause our riders.  He added that it would be a sad day when RTD cannot pay its bills and finish projects it has committed to.  He asked the Board to approve this item, and to continue to work with our partners to find solutions to complete FasTracks sooner rather than later.

Vote on

The Motion:              The motion passed with 8 in favor (Archuleta, Bagley, Deadwyler, Francone, Folska, James, Tobiassen, Walker) and 6 against (Hoy, Lasater, Lubow, Menten, Sisk, Solano).  Director Anderson was absent.

##### a. 2016 APE Adoption - Attachment A

##### b. Revised Attachment B - 09-21-16

## XIII. Executive Session

There was no Executive Session.

## XIV. Old Business

There was no old business.

## XV. New Business

Director Lasater said with the remodeling of the Civic Center Station, our constituents are standing out in the rain, and soon to be snow.  He stated if any Board members know City Council members, to please tell them that the ridership needs some sort of bus shelter.  He remarked that the previous shelters have been displaced and we cannot leave it up to politics and leave people out in the cold.  He added that Civic Center will be under construction for 12-18 months and this needs to get done sooner, rather than later.

Director Bagley said there was an interesting conversation about the APE, and tabling the BRT for state Hwy 119 tonight.  He remarked that these conversations only demonstrated the pennywise and pound foolish perspective of the Board.  He noted the Mobility Choice effort would relate mobility with RTD’s constituents, but the Board is being foolish about expenditures.  He stated he would like to see the Mobility Choice action item come back to the Board.

Director Francone said she too had received comments from constituents regarding snow at Civic Center and asked for shelter options to be presented.  Secondly, she stated that all of the Directors need to think outside of their districts to see what is best for the region.  She noted it is difficult for staff, but solutions need to be found to fund the unfunded corridors.  She remarked that staff needs to look at revenue streams outside of the Agency.

Director Folska recognized Erin Klass for all of her work during her time in the Board Office.  She said that Erin has always performed in an outstanding and professional manner as working in the Board Office is challenging.  She added that Erin will be greatly missed.

Chair Tobiassen said Erin is the backbone of the Board Office and she has always kept the Board on course.

Director Hoy stated he felt compelled to respond to Director Bagley’s comments.  He said that he did not want to discourage other corridors, but was speaking poignantly to people from the North.  He encouraged every Director to speak with staff to ensure that the entire FasTracks system is completed.

## XVI. Adjourn

Chair Tobiassen adjourned the meeting at 6:55 p.m.
