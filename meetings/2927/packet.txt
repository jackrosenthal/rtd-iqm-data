Subject:

Local Government Liaison Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Communications and Government Relations Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to enter into an agreement for Local
Government Liaison services with CRL Associates, Inc. (CRL) to exercise the first option year (January
1, 2020 through December 31, 2020) to extend Contract No. 16-DO-025, at a cost of $105,000.
Funding for this contract is included in the annual budget.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #5 – Effective Communications & Community Outreach
BACKGROUND
In September 2016, RTD issued a Request for Proposals for Local Government Liaison Services. Eight
potential bidders looked at the RFP, but only one responded to this request. The procurement panel
recommended to the Communications and Government Relations Committee the selection of CRL
Associates, Inc. as RTD’s Local Government Liaison with the elected officials and staff of the cities and
counties of the Denver metropolitan area, as well as the business community and economic development
organizations. This team has broad knowledge of RTD, its history, programs and issues, as well as an
extensive network of relationships with local government entities, elected officials, and key stakeholders
along the Front Range. The proposal was submitted for the period of January 1, 2017 through
December 31, 2019, with the potential for two (2) one-year options. The Communications and
Government Relations Committee will make future annual recommendations to the Board of Directors at
the end of each contract period regarding the exercise of future option periods, and this action relates to
the First Option of this contract.
DISCUSSION
CRL Associates, Inc. as RTD’s Local Government Liaison maintains contact with the elected officials and
staff of the cities and counties of the Denver metropolitan area, as well as the business community and
economic development organizations. This team has a broad knowledge of RTD’s needs and issues, as
well as an extensive network of relationships with local governments, elected officials, and key
stakeholders in the Denver metro region. The CRL team has capably represented RTD’s local
government interests and has been an effective strategic partner in the agency’s local stakeholder
coalition building.
As part of the Local Government Liaison services, frequent contact will be made with RTD staff and
board members to ascertain a coordinated plan to monitor and report on activities at the city and county
levels of government. In addition, as part of the coordinated plan, CRL will provide regular outreach to
the business community and economic development organizations in the Metro area to develop
partnerships and garner feedback on RTD issues. CRL will represent RTD at meetings at the local level
of government and provide professional advice, counsel, and analysis of issues regarding local

government activities as they relate to RTD. CRL will also provide Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC)
liaison services.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for the first option year ($105,000) are included in the annual budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Communications and Government
Relations Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to
enter into an agreement for Local Government Liaison services with CRL Associates, Inc. (CRL) to
exercise the first option year (January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020) to extend Contract
No. 16-DO-25, at a cost of $105,000. Funding for this contract is included in the annual budget.
2.

Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to enter into an
agreement to exercise the first option year on the contract for the Local Government Liaison
services. A new Request for Proposals could be sent to interested parties, and a new Local
Government Liaison firm could be retained. This action is not recommended because CRL
Associates, Inc. has been very effective in assisting RTD with local government matters in the
past, and has extensive knowledge of RTD’s programs, issues and policies and is able to guide
strategy at the local government level.

On-Vehicle Advertising Contract Extension

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Communications & Government Relations Committee that the General
Manager or his designee be authorized to exercise a contract extension with Lamar Advertising of
Denver (Lamar) for the one-year period January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020.
The proposed extension would include one “activation” option.
In the event RTD is unable to select a contractor(s) for a combined On-Vehicle and Digital System
Advertising Contract by July 31, 2020, RTD would extend the period of performance one year, January
1, 2021 through December 31, 2021.
Under the terms of the recommended action, Lamar would remit to RTD either 1) a minimum guarantee
of $3.4 million in 2020 and $3.4 million minimum guarantee for the activation period in 2021; or 2)
sixty percent of net sales, whichever is greater.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Task Goal #1 – Fiscal Sustainability
BACKGROUND
On October 28, 2014, RTD awarded Lamar the On-vehicle Advertising Contract 14DO005. This
contract provided for an initial three-year agreement with a two-year option for 2018 and 2019. RTD
exercised the option years in 2017, to extend the agreement to the end of 2019.
In December of 2018, RTD issued an RFP for Digital Advertising and received two proposals. Following
a thorough evaluation of both proposals received and taking into consideration the numerous questions
received during the procurement, RTD decided to cancel the solicitation for Digital Advertising and
develop a more robust and financially lucrative system advertising approach. This approach would
combine the On-Vehicle Advertising Program with a Digital Public Information and Advertising Program
into one larger comprehensive program. Staff will develop a new advertising RFP to include on-vehicle
advertising and digital public information and advertising as a way to enhance the delivery of customer
information and optimize advertising revenues through RTD’s assets.
In order to continue the On-Vehicle Advertising Program while the new procurement proceeds, staff
recommends extending the current contract utilizing the same terms currently in effect for an additional
year to provide staff the opportunity to combine the On-Vehicle and Digital RFPs and procure a new
contract in 2020. The “activation” option provides both RTD and Lamar with a seamless means to
continue the advertising program during the new advertising RFP process.

Packet Pg. 5

1.B.2

DISCUSSION
Lamar has performed well under the terms of the agreement. Regular operations to sell, produce, install,
maintain and remove on-vehicle advertising are proceeding in an acceptable manner. Consistent
communication between RTD and Lamar occurs to address any questions or challenges. Lamar has
coordinated with RTD and Denver Transit Partners on the implementation of advertising on commuter rail
service initiated during the primary three-year term. Lamar delivers the minimum revenue guarantee to
RTD at the beginning of each contract year.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
In 2020, the minimum revenue will be $3.4M each year. In 2021, the minimum guarantee will be $3.4
million for the “activation”. Lamar has delivered the minimum revenue guarantee each year without
incident.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Award a contract extension to Lamar Advertising of Denver for the exclusive sale of exterior
advertising on RTD buses, light rail and commuter rail vehicles and for the non-exclusive sale of
interior advertising on RTD buses, light rail and commuter rail vehicles, for a one-year period
January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020 to include one “activation” option.
In the event RTD does not select a contractor(s) for a combined On-Vehicle and Digital System
Advertising Agreement before July 31, 2020, the “activation” option would initiate, extending the
performance period for an additional year from January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021.
Under the terms of this recommended action, Lamar would remit to RTD either 1) a minimum
guarantee of $3.4 million in 2020 and $3.4 million minimum guarantee for the activation period in
2021; or 2) sixty percent of net sales, whichever is greater. This is the staff recommendation.
2. Do not award a contract extension to Lamar Advertising of Denver and reissue the RFP. This
alternative is not recommended because 1) there will be a lapse in the agency’s system
advertising program 2) Lamar has performed under the terms of the agreement in the initial threeyears of the agreement and 3) the contract minimum revenue guarantees proposed by Lamar
exceeded the minimum guarantee required in the RFP and would be a lost revenue stream for the
agency.

Revised System Advertising Policy

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Communications and Government Relations Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors approve the revision to the RTD System Advertising Policy. The revisions bring the policy up
to date to reflect current trends and factors that impact advertising policy. The proposed policy
(attached) provides two specific updates from the previous version:
1. Includes stations, buildings, facilities and properties as well as RTD’s electronic
communications channels to expand the assets available for advertising.
2. Formally prohibits the advertising of cannabis and electronic cigarette products on RTD
assets.
The first revision is needed in order to provide the forum for RTD to entertain proposals for digital
advertising. The second revision formally excludes cannabis as a product allowable for advertising on
RTD properties. Despite not being excluded previously, RTD has not entertained any cannabis
advertising to date.
This recommended action supports the General Manager’s 2019 goals – Task Goal #1 – Fiscal
Sustainability
BACKGROUND
In August of 2015, RTD adopted the current System Advertising Policy. At this time, with the proposed
introduction of digital advertising, the Communications and Government Relations Committee is
recommending updating the advertising policy to reflect these changes in advertising media and
locations. This recommendation maintains the current commercial advertising standards adopted in
2015 and applies them to a wider array of advertising options across RTD’s assets. Further, excluding
the advertising of cannabis on the system maintains RTD’s good standing with regard to federal funding.
DISCUSSION
The recommended change to the RTD System Advertising Policy would maintain uniform, reasonable,
and viewpoint-neutral standards for the display of advertising in and on the vehicles, stations, buildings,
facilities and properties of the Regional Transportation District and its affiliated and subsidiary agencies
(together "RTD") and maintain the property as a limited public forum by excluding advertising of a noncommercial nature.
By accepting paid advertising for display in and on RTD property, the RTD is acting in a proprietary
capacity as a provider of public transportation seeking to maximize advertising revenue to support its
transportation operations.

Packet Pg. 7

1.B.3

In furtherance of the RTD's purpose of maximizing advertising revenue, the RTD in its proprietary
capacity would limit advertisements it will accept for display across the agency’s assets to paid
commercial advertising, certain public service announcements and messages that will help build goodwill
for the RTD among its riders and the public, and governmental partners. The RTD would continue to
retain control over the advertising that it will allow to be displayed in and on the system.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Adopt the change to the System Advertising Policy. This alternative is recommended to reflect
important updates to the policy to reflect current trends and factors that impact advertising policy.
Also, the update allows RTD to add digital advertising to the advertising program and provide a
new revenue stream for the agency. This alternative is the staff recommendation.
2. Retain the existing System Advertising Policy. This alternative is not recommended because it
doesn’t align with the agency’s desire to add digital advertising to its advertising program and
generate additional revenues for the agency.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
RTD is preparing a more robust and financially lucrative system advertising approach. This approach
would combine the On-Vehicle Advertising Program with a Digital Public Information and Advertising
Program into one larger comprehensive program. This more comprehensive advertising program will
enhance the delivery of customer information and optimize advertising revenues through RTD’s assets.
Adoption of the Revised System Advertising Policy will allow this RFP to be published and RTD to assess
the value of proposals from prospective vendors. Without this change, RTD will not be able pursue
enhanced digital advertising and will have to forego the increased revenue that is expected through
digital advertising.

Local Government Relations Update

Below is our update for December 2019:
1. Governor’s Transportation Summit on Funding – Governor Polis convened 100 or so
transportation professionals, elected officials and industry leaders on November 5 to a
funding discussion and update on various groups exploring transportation funding strategies
through regional and other approaches. Dave Genova and Director Guissinger were
present from RTD. There were two presentations of interest to RTD: (1) a representative
of the Southwest Chief & Front Range Passenger Rail Commission presented information
regarding the Front Range Passenger Rail Feasibility Study and other multimodal options
linking Pueblo, Colorado Springs and Fort Collins to Denver; (2) Catherine Marinelli
presented an update on the Metro Mayors Caucus’s proposed Enhanced MPO (EMPO).
There were some pointed comments related to RTD from legislators present and concerns
expressed about both the Rail Study and EMPO proposal. A follow up summit is likely to
be held in December, but no date has been announced.
2. Metro Mayors Caucus Transportation and Mobility Committee –The Metro Mayors
Caucus Transportation and Mobility Committee met on November 14. Although RTD
wasn’t on the published agenda, there was considerable discussion about how the MMC
could engage with RTD in a constructive manner to provide input into the ongoing
discussions around structure, capacity and service. The next meeting will be on Friday,
December 13. The agenda will include a discussing a process for engaging with RTD in
2020, as well as updates on possible areas of focus for MobilityNEXT and on their
EMPO proposal which the Board heard about from Jacquie Millet in October. There is
concern both within the region and the state as to the possible implications of the EMPO
and we will continue to monitor the discussion.
3. Metro Mayors Caucus Annual Retreat – The Metro Mayors Caucus Annual Retreat is
scheduled for 9-noon on Saturday, January 11, 2020 at the Opera Colorado Opera Center,
located at 4121 S Navajo St, Englewood, CO 80110, We expect transportation/transit to
be one of the primary discussion items on the agenda. It should be noted that the retreat
will be the first meeting of the Caucus since 10 new mayors were elected.

Re:

End of Year Update

The 2019 interim legislative season has been very busy and given the increased interest in RTD
operations by legislators BBMK has spent much of our time focused on continuing to educate
legislators on issues of importance to the District as well as providing opportunities for RTD’s
staff and Board members to engage with State elected officials.
BBMK has been participating in transportation funding conversations at the Capitol both with
the Governor’s Office and various legislators interested in looking at potential transportation
funding options. BBMK has also monitored multiple legislative interim committees focusing on
draft proposals which could have an operational impact to RTD.
The following is a summary of our work to date:
•

BBMK monitored and provided detailed reports on the work of the following Interim
Committees: The Transportation Legislation Review Committee (TLRC), SB 239,
Impacts of Emerging Technologies stakeholder group meetings, Sales and Use Tax
Simplification Task Force, Family and Medical Leave (FAMLI) Task Force, and the
Tax Expenditure Evaluation Interim Study Committee. Attached at the end of this
report is a list of the bills approved by Legislative Council on November 15 that came
out of interim committees we monitored on the District’s behalf.

•

BBMK organized a call at the request of Speaker KC Becker to discuss her questions
about sales tax collection data kept at RTD within each specific RTD district. General
Manager Dave Genova, CFO Heather McKillop, Sherry Ellebracht and Director
Guissinger participated in this call. RTD staff is preparing a response to the questions
raised by the Speaker and a follow up meeting has been scheduled to present
information from staff to her in December.

•

At the request of the Transportation Legislative Review Committee, BBMK worked
with Senior Staff to arrange a tour of the 61AV project on September 27th. The tour
highlighted the District’s commitment to include innovation in future transportation
planning. Legislators in attendance included Representatives Matt Gray, Monica Duran,
Meg Froelich and Senators Faith Winter, Dennis Hisey and Kevin Priola. Board
Members in attendance included Board Chair Doug Tisdale, Directors Peggy Catlin,
Lynn Guissinger, Angie Malipede, Vince Buzek and Troy Whitmore. General Manager
Dave Genova, Sherry Ellebracht and Bruce Abel were also present.

•

BBMK attended a meeting with Senator Priola and other transportation stakeholders on
October 7th to discuss potential legislation to increase the gas tax in order to raise

BBMK at the request of Rep. Shannon Bird (Westminster) worked with RTD Senior
Staff to coordinate a tour of the B Line as part of the Colorado Competitive Council’s
(C3) October 22-23 legislative trip. This trip included Senator Dennis Hisey, Senator
Rob Woodward, Rep. Marc Snyder, Rep. Colin Larson, and Rep. Kerry Tipper as well
as local elected officials along the North Line. Bill Sirois gave an update to the group
on RTD activities in the area. RTD Directors Shelley Cook, Lynn Guissinger, Angie
Malipede were invited guests of the Colorado Competitive Council (C3).

•

BBMK coordinated RTD’s presentation in front of the TLRC for General Manager
Dave Genova and Board Chair Doug Tisdale. Prior to this presentation, BBMK met
with TLRC Chair Rep. Matt Gray to provide an update on the District’s presentation.
RTD Board Directors Shelley Cook, Lynn Guissinger, Kate Williams, Angie Malipede,
Peggy Catlin and Chair Doug Tisdale attended the meeting.

•

BBMK was invited by House Speaker KC Becker to attend a meeting on transportation
funding solutions. The Speaker challenged stakeholders to look for potential funding
solutions which could generate new revenue and options that could garner bi-partisan
support. CDOT Director Shoshana Lew, Chairs of the Transportation committees,
lobbyists for the business community and Cary Kennedy, Senior Advisor for Fiscal
Policy from the Polis Administration along with invited guests General Manager
Genova and Director Guissinger attended the meeting.

•

RTD Government relations Chair Director Guissinger requested that BBMK invite Joint
Budget Committee Members Senator Dominick Moreno, Senator Rachel Zenzinger,
Rep. Chris Hansen and Rep. Kim Ransom to attend the December 17th RTD Board
meeting. JBC members who represent areas within the RTD district boundaries have
been invited to share an overview of the State budget as well as various proposals that
might be introduced during the 2020 legislative session on transportation funding.

•

BBMK has set up a regular monthly scheduled telephone town hall call where we invite
all 100 State legislators to hear from RTD Senior Staff, RTD Board Chair Doug Tisdale
and Government Relations Chair Director Lynn Guissinger. The goal of the town hall
call is to provide a regular forum for legislators to ask questions of RTD and for the
District to share updates on our most recent activities. The first call was held on
November 7 and the following legislators phoned in: Senator Jeff Bridges, Senator
Faith Winter, Rep. Matt Gray and Rep. Brianna Titone. The next call is schedule for
December 12 at 3pm.

•

BBMK continues to coordinate meetings with Board Members and elected officials.
These are courtesy introductory meetings with the goal of enhancing relationships
between Board Members and State elected officials. To date we have met with the

RTD’s 2019 discretionary grant awards
advance key agency priorities

• Due to partisan gridlock over funding for a southern border wall, impeachment
proceedings, and other issues, none of the 12 spending bills for FY 2020 (which began
October 1) has been passed.
• Federal government is operating under its second Continuing Resolution (CR) of the
fiscal year, funding agencies and programs through midnight on December 20.
• This larger partisan environment has affected normally bipartisan transportation:
• Delayed FY 2020 transit formula apportionments: Making grants to 2,000 recipients
is time-consuming work, so FTA generally will not apportion transit formula funds
under any spending bill shorter than five months.
• Partisan surface transportation legislation: In a major break with Committee

tradition, House T & I Chairman DeFazio is drafting his own surface transportation
authorization bill, without his Republican counterparts.
•

Greatest area of disagreement is over measures to address climate change.

What is the current state of play
on transportation issues in Washington?

Top Priority: Return of $29 million in CRP funds on repaid RRIF loan for Denver
Union Station redevelopment project.
• Headwinds:
• Total breakdown of Congressional appropriations process – the most viable
legislative vehicle for our fix is the Transportation/HUD (THUD)
appropriations bill.
• House appropriators, while sympathetic, view this as the Senate’s problem to

fix.
• Tailwinds:
• Bipartisan Congressional delegation – important with a divided Congress.
• Bicameral support of our delegation.
• Senate FY 2020 THUD bill was gutted to serve as vehicle for the latest CR, so

THUD spending bill may be back in play.

RTD’s Federal Priorities:
Advancing our agenda in a partisan Washington

1.C.5.a

• June: Led by Rep. Perlmutter, House delegation produces a fully-funded, bipartisan
amendment to refund CRPs on repaid Cohort 3 RRIF loans (includes RTD’s), but
objections to the funding source by House Democrats meant the amendment could not
advance on House FY 2020 THUD bill.
• July: Senators Gardner and Bennet introduce legislation, S. 2213, to refund CRPs on all
repaid Cohort 3 RRIF loans.
• September: APTA’s industry-wide reauthorization principles include RTD’s RRIF CRP
fix.
• October: Senators Gardner and Bennet file S. 2213 as an amendment to the FY 2020
THUD bill; amendment not offered (authorizing on an appropriations bill).
• November:
• SPB pursuing introduction of a House companion bill to S. 2213, in preparation
for House action on surface transportation legislation in CY 2020.
• RTD CEO sends letter to Senators Bennet and Gardner making clear that RRIF CRP

fix is our highest Federal legislative priority.
• December: SPB pursuing inclusion of RRIF CRP fix in final conference version of FY
2020 THUD bill, in line with FY 2019 approach for Cohort 1 loans.

Recent Progress on RRIF CRP Fix

1.C.5.a

• Expand BRT eligibility to include proven, performance-based approach to reliable

travel times.
• Allow BRT service operating in mixed traffic to be eligible for New Starts

funding.
• Due to sustained opposition from Senate Banking Committee staff, proposal not

included in FAST Act or in APTA’s 2019 reauthorization principles.
• Strategy to overcome opposition and advance this legislative change:
• Build coalition of support among like-minded transit agencies.
• Leverage RTD’s position as a national leader that knows the challenges and
rewards of advancing major capital projects.
• Encourage site visit by Senate Banking Committee staff.
• Tout our own “proof of concept” in US 36 BRT’s improved travel times while
other roads face growing congestion.

RTD’s Federal Priorities in Next Authorization Bill

1.C.5.a

• Deadline: Congress must pass one or more spending bills before December 20 expiration of the
current short-term Continuing Resolution.
• Aim is to pass omnibus (or multiple mini-buses) to fund all departments and programs of
the Federal government for the remainder of the fiscal year.
• Transit spending levels: House and Senate have each passed their FY 2020 THUD spending
bills, but have not reconciled the two bills.
• Under the CR: Short-term extension of robust FY 2019 levels for transit formula programs
under FAST Act, yet no formula funding apportioned by FTA until full-year bill is in place.
• Under FY 2020 THUD Bills: House and Senate FY 2020 bills both fully fund transit formula

programs at their FY 2020 FAST Act level: $10.15 billion.
• BUILD (TIGER) funding: $1 billion in House and Senate bills, above FY 2019 enacted level

of $900 million.
• New Starts (CIG) funding:
• Trump Administration, Senate, and House all propose funding CIG program at lower
than FY 2019 enacted level of $2.55 billion:
• Administration: $1.50 billion to fund only projects with signed FFGAs.
• House: $2.30 billion.
• Senate: $1.98 billion.

FY 2020 Appropriations

1.C.5.a

• The FAST Act expires September 30, 2020.
• Neither the House nor the Senate has announced a schedule for moving comprehensive
reauthorization legislation by then.
• Senate EPW Committee: Only committee taking action to date – reported out a bipartisan

highway bill in August.
• Robust authorization levels unsupportable by current revenues.
• Largest hurdle, by far, is how to pay for the programs after the end of the FAST Act, as

spending has outpaced Highway Trust Fund revenues since FY 2008.
• Same politically-difficult revenue options remain, made harder in an election year.
• Earmarks would help build support for a revenue increase.
• House Ways and Means and Senate Finance Committees are responsible for

revenues, not the authorizing committees.
• So there is a little/no connection between what will be included in
transportation authorization bills and what can actually be paid for with current
revenues.
• Stakeholders should prepare for short-term extension(s) of the FAST Act, as was the case
at the end of MAP-21.

FAST Act Reauthorization

• One area of common ground?
• Democrats have recently revived efforts to move a large infrastructure bill.

• They are vulnerable to attacks from Republicans that they cannot get anything done

during impeachment, while President Trump has repeatedly stated he can work with
Democrats on infrastructure.
• Both sides proposed $1 trillion-plus funding levels with no viable proposals on how to
fund a bill that large.
• Democrats want to show they can govern:
• Envision a large bill, funding projects across many sectors, from transportation to
schools to broadband.
• Rejected Trump’s earlier infrastructure proposal as lacking new revenues, over reliant
on finance tools and P3s, and undermining transit and environmental protections.
• Republicans expect Trump to find the funds:
• In the Senate, no interest, time, or energy to move a broad bill; Senate committees
focused on individual bills to address surface transportation (highways/transit/rail),
water resources, and autonomous vehicles.
• Congressional Republicans have made clear that the President must lead on this
legislation, particularly on how to fund it.

1.C.5.a

Whatever happened to bipartisan plans for a big
infrastructure package?

•

1.C.5.a

Presidential election:
• Field of Democratic candidates is not clearing.
• Infrastructure not yet meaningfully addressed by any candidate.

•

Senate races in 2020 include Senator Gardner’s reelection:
• First-term Senator is expected to have a tough race.
• His race is one of four in the Senate considered a “toss up” at this time.
• Since his election, Coloradans supported Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump in 2018
by 5 percentage points and Democrats flipped Colorado’s 6th Congressional district
in 2018.
• Senator Gardner is the only member of our delegation serving on a transportation
committee in Congress.
• Impact of Senator Gardner loss could be lessened if Democrats flip the US Senate.
• Republicans will be defending 23 seats in 2020, while Democrats will be defending
just 12.
• Increasingly unlikely to get funding increases needed for FAST Act reauthorization or broad
infrastructure package as elections approach – few Member of Congress want to take a
“tough” vote to raise taxes.
• A FAST Act extension, rather than reauthorization, is more likely.
