• On-Vehicle Advertising Contract Extension

It is recommended by the Communications & Government Relations
Committee that the General Manager or his designee be authorized to exercise
a contract extension with Lamar Advertising of Denver (Lamar) for the oneyear period January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020.
The proposed extension would include one “activation” option.
In the event RTD is unable to select a contractor(s) for a combined On-Vehicle
and Digital System Advertising Contract by July 31, 2020, RTD would extend
the period of performance one year, January 1, 2021 through December 31,
2021.
Under the terms of the recommended action, Lamar would remit to RTD either
1) a minimum guarantee of $3.4 million in 2020 and $3.4 million minimum
guarantee for the activation period in 2021; or 2) sixty percent of net sales,
whichever is greater.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Task Goal #1 – Fiscal Sustainability
Motion:

Director Whitmore made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the December 17, 2019
Board Meeting.

Committee Chair Guissinger declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

• Revised System Advertising Policy
It is recommended by the Communications and Government Relations
Committee that the RTD Board of Directors approve the revision to the RTD
System Advertising Policy. The revisions bring the policy up to date to reflect
current trends and factors that impact advertising policy. The proposed policy
(attached) provides two specific updates from the previous version:
1. Includes stations, buildings, facilities and properties as well as RTD’s
electronic communications channels to expand the assets available for
advertising.

2. Formally prohibits the advertising of cannabis and electronic cigarette
products on RTD assets.
The first revision is needed in order to provide the forum for RTD to entertain
proposals for digital advertising. The second revision formally excludes
cannabis as a product allowable for advertising on RTD properties. Despite
not being excluded previously, RTD has not entertained any cannabis
advertising to date.
This recommended action supports the General Manager’s 2019 goals – Task
Goal #1 – Fiscal Sustainability
Motion:

Director Broom made the motion to move
this item to the full Board at the December
17, 2019 Board Meeting.
Director Folska seconded the motion.
