### B. Recommended Actions

#### 1. Local Government Liaison Services

It is recommended by the Communications and Government Relations Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to enter into an agreement for Local Government Liaison services with CRL Associates, Inc. (CRL) to exercise the first option year (January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020) to extend Contract No. 16-DO-025, at a cost of $105,000.  Funding for this contract is included in the annual budget.

This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:

Core Goal #5 – Effective Communications & Community Outreach

Motion:               Director Buzek made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the December 17, 2019 Board Meeting.

Director Williams seconded the motion.

Committee Chair Guissinger declared the motion PASSED.

#### 2. On-Vehicle Advertising Contract Extension

It is recommended by the Communications & Government Relations Committee that the General Manager or his designee be authorized to exercise a contract extension with Lamar Advertising of Denver (Lamar) for the one-year period January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020.

The proposed extension would include one “activation” option.

In the event RTD is unable to select a contractor(s) for a combined On-Vehicle and Digital System Advertising Contract by July 31, 2020, RTD would extend the period of performance one year, January 1, 2021 through December 31, 2021.

Under the terms of the recommended action, Lamar would remit to RTD either 1) a minimum guarantee of $3.4 million in 2020 and $3.4 million minimum guarantee for the activation period in 2021; or 2) sixty percent of net sales, whichever is greater.

This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:

Task Goal #1 – Fiscal Sustainability

Motion:               Director Whitmore made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the December 17, 2019 Board Meeting.

Director Walker seconded the motion.

Committee Chair Guissinger declared the motion PASSED.

#### 3. Revised System Advertising Policy

It is recommended by the Communications and Government Relations Committee that the RTD Board of Directors approve the revision to the RTD System Advertising Policy.  The revisions bring the policy up to date to reflect current trends and factors that impact advertising policy. The proposed policy (attached) provides two specific updates from the previous version:

1.       Includes stations, buildings, facilities and properties as well as RTD’s electronic communications channels to expand the assets available for advertising.

2.       Formally prohibits the advertising of cannabis and electronic cigarette products on RTD assets.

The first revision is needed in order to provide the forum for RTD to entertain proposals for digital advertising. The second revision formally excludes cannabis as a product allowable for advertising on RTD properties.  Despite not being excluded previously, RTD has not entertained any cannabis advertising to date.

This recommended action supports the General Manager’s 2019 goals – Task Goal #1 – Fiscal Sustainability

Motion:               Director Broom made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the December 17, 2019 Board Meeting.

Director Folska seconded the motion.

Committee Chair Guissinger declared the motion PASSED.
