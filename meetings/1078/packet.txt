Hop Cost Share Agreement

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is Recommended by the by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter
into a Cost Sharing Agreement with the City of Boulder to provide RTD financial support for the
operation of the HOP circulator bus service in the commercial areas of the City of Boulder, the University
of Colorado at Boulder and adjacent business and residential areas. This agreement is for calendar year
2013 and is for an amount not to exceed $1,459,589.00.

BACKGROUND
The City of Boulder has funded and provided circulator bus service, known as the HOP, within the City
of Boulder since October of 1994. This service provides mobility and access to the commercial areas of
the city, the University of Colorado at Boulder, and adjacent business and residential developments.
RTD also provides extensive bus service to/from and within the City of Boulder. RTD and the City of
Boulder have worked together to assure that these services are complementary and work together to
provide attractive and effective transit service for people living, studying and working in the area.
The HOP currently operates from 7:00 AM to 10:00 PM on weekdays, from 9:00 AM to 10:00 PM on
Saturdays, and from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM on Sundays and holidays. In addition, Night HOP service is
provided and funded entirely by the University of Colorado. Currently, the HOP provides approximately
2,764 passenger trips per weekday.
DISCUSSION
RTD shall contribute funding to the City of Boulder to support the operation of the HOP in an amount not
to exceed $1,459,589.00 in 2013.
This Agreement will be for a period of one year. HOP performance will be assessed at the end of the
year to determine if performance expectations have been met and to determine if continuation of the cost
sharing agreement is warranted. Performance will be evaluated in terms of RTD’s service standards. If it
appears that service performance does not warrant continuation, RTD and the City of Boulder will confer
on modifications to the service in order to bring it into conformance. The provision of HOP service
through 3rd Quarter in 2012 resulted in 27.4 passengers per hour and an RTD subsidy per HOP passenger
trip of $1.62. The subsidy per passenger for RTD fixed route service in 2011 ranged from an average of
$2.62 subsidy per passenger for CBD local routes to an average of $7.12 subsidy per passenger for
suburban local service and an average of $4.96 subsidy per passenger for regional service.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for RTD support of the HOP service were included in the approved 2013 RTD budget. Nothing
herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this Agreement.

Packet Pg. 3

2.1

ALTERNATIVES
1.
Approve the cost sharing agreement with the City of Boulder for the HOP circulator bus service
so that the City of Boulder can continue to provide this service to the residents, students and
businesses in the City of Boulder.
2.
Do not approve the cost sharing agreement. This course of action is not recommended as it may
result in a reduction to or elimination of the heavily-used HOP circulator service.

Subject:

DRCOG Vanpool Agreement

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into an
Agreement with the Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) to provide RTD support and
expansion of the DRCOG RideArrangers vanpool program in the Denver metropolitan area. This agreement
is for calendar year 2013 and shall be in an amount not to exceed $730,000.00.

BACKGROUND
Vanpooling is a transportation option in which commuters/employees whose residences are
geographically clustered ride together to and from their work sites in a van that is driven and maintained
by one of the vanpool participants. Typically, the vans carry from six (6) to twelve (12) riders and are
provided by the vanpool program. Vanpools are organized to be sustainable and to render regular, ongoing service to vanpool members on a break-even, cost sharing, fare basis. Vanpools eliminate the costs
associated with dedicated drivers and expensive equipment.
As a transportation mode, vanpools provide personalized transportation at low cost and offer greater
opportunities for increased capacity as compared to carpooling. Vanpools also offer a cost-effective
alternative to conventional transit service in areas of low population density and longer commute
distances.
DISCUSSION
RTD has supported the DRCOG RideArrangers vanpool program since 2001. The vanpool program had
previously experienced limited participation due to perceived high fares, insufficient funding for van
acquisition, difficulties in recruiting drivers, and the lack of funding to support necessary marketing
activities. In order to help overcome these barriers, the RTD and the DRCOG entered into a partnership in
April of 2001 to expand vanpool service in the Denver metropolitan area. In doing so, RTD and DRCOG
believed that the organizations could make meaningful advances toward meeting shared goals of offering
desirable mobility options, reducing traffic congestion, and improving air quality in the Denver
metropolitan area. Benefits for RTD include substantial cost savings from avoidance and/or replacement
on marginal bus routes with vanpools. Benefits to both RTD and DRCOG include complementary
marketing programs and increased commuter transportation alternatives.
RTD financial support is used to help to underwrite the vanpool pricing structure in order to make vanpool
fares more competitive in the transportation marketplace. By subsidizing vanpool fares, vanpools are able
to compete with other transit alternatives and are perceived as a more attractive alternative for area
commuters. In addition, RTD support is used to provide incentives to attract and retain vanpool drivers
and to provide capital funding to acquire necessary rolling stock to provide vanpool services. Since the
advent of RTD support for the vanpool program in late 2001, the number of vans in service grew from 11
to 99 vans.

Packet Pg. 5

2.2

In 2009 the vanpool program became difficult to manage due to a shortage of DRCOG personnel.
DRCOG looked outside their agency at private companies currently operating vanpool services in other
metropolitan areas. After a competitive bid process, DRCOG choose VPSI to operate the vanpool
program. VPSI took over all operating aspects of the vanpool program. Over the next few years, VPSI
will phase out the DRCOG owned vehicles with leased vehicles. Since taking over the program the
number of vanpools has declined. Currently there are 97 active vans. The number of vanpoolers per
vehicle, however, has risen. In 2009, the vanpool program had a 63% capacity; in 2010, 93%; in 2011
and 2012 the number has stabilized to 81%. VPSI has held the vanpoolers more accountable in covering
costs of their individual vanpools. This in turn has resulted in more vanpoolers in each van.
DRCOG vanpool performance through the 3rd Quarter in 2012 resulted in an RTD subsidy per passenger
trip of approximately $1.87. The subsidy per passenger for RTD fixed route service in 2011 ranged from
an average of $2.62 subsidy per passenger for CBD local routes to an average of $7.12 subsidy per
passenger for suburban local service and an average of $4.96 subsidy per passenger for regional service.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for RTD support of the CRCOG Van pool program were budgeted in the approved 2012 budget.
Nothing herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this Agreement.
ALTERNATIVES
1.
Approve the financial support of the DRCOG RideArrangers vanpool service in order to continue
to provide and expand this transportation option for residents of the Denver metropolitan area
who work/commute in the Denver metropolitan area.
2.
Do not approve the cost sharing agreement. This course of action is not recommended as it may
result in a reduction to or elimination of the DRCOG RideArrangers vanpool program which would
result in an increase in single occupant commuting.

North Front Range Vanpool Agreement

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into an
Agreement with the North Front Range Metropolitan Planning Organization (NFRMPO) to provide RTD
support and expansion of the NFR VANGO vanpool program in the Denver metropolitan area. This
agreement is for calendar year 2013 and shall be in an amount not to exceed $425,000.00.

BACKGROUND
Vanpooling is a transportation option in which commuters/employees whose residences are
geographically clustered ride together to and from their work sites in a van that is driven and maintained
by one of the vanpool participants. Typically, the vans carry from six (6) to twelve (12) riders and are
provided by the vanpool program. Vanpools are organized to be sustainable and to render regular, ongoing service to vanpool members on a break-even, cost sharing, fare basis. Vanpools eliminate the costs
associated with dedicated drivers and expensive equipment.
As a transportation mode, vanpools provide personalized transportation at low cost and offer greater
opportunities for increased capacity as compared to carpooling. Vanpools also offer a cost-effective
alternative to conventional transit service in areas of low population density and longer commute
distances.
DISCUSSION
RTD has supported the NFRMPO VANGO vanpool program since 2003. The program targets long
distance commuters who live in Northern Colorado and who travel to the Denver metropolitan area. Of
the vans in operation, 75% provide service in the RTD district. The RTD subsidy is based on vanpool
travel within the RTD district. The vanpool program had been limited by perceived high fares, insufficient
funding for van acquisition, difficulties in recruiting drivers, and the lack of funding to support necessary
marketing activities. In order to help overcome these barriers, the RTD and the NFRMPO entered into a
partnership in 2003 to expand vanpool service coming into the Denver metropolitan area. In doing so,
RTD and NFRMPO believed that the organizations could make meaningful advances toward meeting
shared goals of offering desirable mobility options, reducing traffic congestion, and improving air quality
in the Denver metropolitan area. RTD financial support is used to help to underwrite the vanpool pricing
structure in order to make vanpool fares more competitive in the transportation marketplace. By
subsidizing vanpool fares, vanpools are able to compete with other transit alternatives and are perceived
as a more attractive alternative for area commuters. In addition, RTD’s support is used to provide
incentives to attract and retain vanpool drivers and to provide capital funding to acquire necessary rolling
stock to provide vanpool services. In return for this funding NFRMPO provides RTD with National
Transportation Data. This data is included in the NTD numbers reported by RTD and used by the Federal
Government to determine the amount of federal funding allocated to RTD. Since the advent of RTD
support for the vanpool program in late 2003, the number of vans serving the Denver metropolitan area
has grown from 28 to 58 vans.

Packet Pg. 7

2.3

RTD shall contribute funding to NFRMPO to support the provision of the VANGO vanpool service in an
amount not to exceed $425,000.00 in 2013. NFRMPO vanpool performance through the 3 rd Quarter in
2012 resulted in an RTD subsidy of approximately $3.33 per passenger trip. The subsidy per passenger
for RTD fixed route service in 2011 ranged from an average of $2.62 subsidy per passenger for CBD
local routes to an average of $7.12 subsidy per passenger for suburban local service and an average of
$4.96 subsidy per passenger for regional service.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for RTD support of the NFRMPO VANGO vanpool program were included in the approved 2013
RTD budget. Nothing herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this Agreement.
ALTERNATIVES
1.
Approve the financial support of the NFRMPO VANGO vanpool service in order to continue to
provide and expand this transportation option for residents of Northern Colorado who commute to
and work in the Denver metropolitan area.
2.
Do not approve the cost sharing agreement. This course of action is not recommended as it may
result in a reduction to or elimination of the VANGO vanpool program which would result in an

Art Shuttle Cost Share Agreement

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into a Cost
Sharing Agreement with the City of Englewood to provide RTD financial support for the operation of the
art circulator bus service in the City of Englewood. This agreement is for calendar year 2013 and is for
an amount not to exceed $297,000.00.

BACKGROUND
In 2003 the City of Englewood applied for and received a Congestion Mitigation Air Quality (CMAQ)
Grant for a circular bus service. This grant was approved with funding available 2004-2007. CMAQ
funds were approved for 80% of the cost of the service. RTD contributed 10% of the expense and the
City of Englewood contributed 10%. The art shuttle was a free service. In September 2007, with the
expiration of the CMAQ grant, the RTD took over funding of the art shuttle. The City of Englewood
continues the management and marketing of the art shuttle. The City of Englewood covers all marketing
and related expenses. The art shuttle continues to be a free service that is sponsored by the City of
Englewood. The City of Englewood reimburses RTD for the fares that would have been paid if the art
shuttle charged a RTD fare.
The art shuttle currently operates from 6:30 AM to 6:30 PM on weekdays. There is no service on
Saturdays, Sundays or holidays. The shuttle operates between the Englewood light rail station and
Swedish Medical Center/Craig Hospital. The art shuttle operates as a free shuttle on a fifteen (15)
minute frequency. Ridership has averaged 843 boardings per day or 31.3 passengers per hour.
DISCUSSION
RTD shall contribute funding to the City of Englewood to support the operation of the art shuttle in an
amount not to exceed $297,000 in 2013.
This Agreement will be for a period of one year. The performance of the art shuttle will be assessed at
the end of the year to determine if performance expectations have been met and to determine if
continuation of the cost sharing agreement is warranted. Performance will be evaluated in terms of
RTD’s service standards. If it appears that service performance will not warrant continuation, RTD and
the City of Englewood will confer on modifications to the service in order to bring it into conformance.
The provision of art shuttle service through 3rd Quarter in 2012 resulted in 31.3 passengers per hour and
an RTD subsidy per art shuttle passenger trip of $1.31. The subsidy per passenger for RTD fixed route
service in 2011 ranged from an average of $2.62 subsidy per passenger for CBD local routes to an
average of $7.12 subsidy per passenger for suburban local service and an average of $4.96 subsidy per
passenger for regional service. The City of Englewood will continue to pay for all fares for the art
shuttle.

Cost Share Agreements MAP 21 -5311

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into funding
agreements with Via Mobility of Boulder and the Seniors’ Resource Center to provide RTD financial
support for the provision of FTA Section 5311 (non-urbanized) services for Boulder County, Adams
County and Jefferson County. These Agreements are for calendar year 2013 and for amounts not to
exceed $335,298.00 for Boulder County, $300,000.00 for Adams County and $102,248.00 for
Jefferson County.

BACKGROUND
The Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU),
along with previous transit legislation, provides for the funding of transit services in non-urbanized, or
rural, areas. The section of the Act that addresses the provision of services in non-urbanized areas is
Section 5311 and thus these services are often referred to as “5311 service.” In 2013, SAFETEA-LU
provisions will be administered under the new Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP21). Since 1991, RTD has provided funding to various private, non-profit agencies to assist with the
provision of transit services in non-urbanized areas of the District and to provide local match money for
federal grant funds to support the provision of 5311 services in the District. RTD has provided financial
assistance for the provision of non-urbanized service in Jefferson County since 1991 and has provided
financial assistance for the provision of non-urbanized service in Adams and Boulder Counties since
1993.
DISCUSSION
RTD shall contribute funding to Via Mobility to support the provision of non-urbanized services in Boulder
County in an amount not to exceed $335,298.00 in 2013. RTD shall also contribute funding to Special
Transit to support the provision of non-urbanized services in Adams County in amount not to exceed
$330,000.00 in 2013.
RTD shall contribute funding to Seniors’ Resource Center to support the provision of non-urbanized
services in Jefferson County in an amount not to exceed $102,248.00 in 2013.
This Agreement will be for a period of one year. 5311 performance will be assessed at the end of the
year to determine if performance expectations have been met and to determine if continuation of the
funding agreements is warranted. Performance will be evaluated in terms of RTD’s service standards.
If it appears that service performance will not warrant continuation, RTD and the affected party(s) will
confer on modifications needed to bring it into conformance. The provision of 5311 service in 2012
(current numbers available) resulted in monthly performance that ranged from 1.9 to 2.2 passengers
per hour and an RTD subsidy per passenger boarding ranging from approximately $1.66 to
approximately $3.79 (subsidy reflects only the RTD contribution). RTD Call-n-Ride monthly
performance averaged 4.8 passengers per hour in 2011 while RTD Access-a-Ride service performs at
approximately 1.2 passengers per hour. Call-n-Ride performed at an average subsidy per passenger

boarding of $15.44 in 2011 while access-a-Ride performed at an average subsidy per passenger trip of
approximately $55.87 in 2011.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for RTD support of the 5311 services were included in the approved 2013 RTD budget. This
Agreement will be for a period of one year. Nothing herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this
Agreement.
ALTERNATIVES
1.
Approve the 5311 cost sharing agreements with Via Mobility and Seniors’ Resource Center so
that these organizations can continue to provide transit services to individuals in the nonurbanized, rural areas of Boulder, Adams, and Jefferson counties.
2.
Do not approve the cost sharing agreement. This course of action is not recommended as it may
result in a reduction to or elimination of transit services in the non-urbanized, rural areas of
Boulder, Adams, and Jefferson counties.

Contracted Fixed Route Services 2012 Year
End Budget Transfer

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize a budget transfer from the purchased transportation service and fuel line items of the “Group
21” budget to the “Group 23” budget to cover the variation in costs incurred as a result of adjustments
to service levels associated with runboard service changes in 2012. The total dollar amount of the
budget transfer is $350,000 ($200,000 for service, $150,000 for fuel).

BACKGROUND:
RTD currently contracts with two (2) different service providers, First Transit and Veolia
Transportation, to provide fixed route transit services under four (4) service contracts. First Transit
operates the “Group 20” (Commerce City), “Group 22” (Longmont) and “Group 23” (Denver) service
contracts. Veolia operates the “Group 21” service contract.
DISCUSSION:
Effective with the January 2012 runboard service changes, RTD Service Planning & Scheduling made
adjustments in the number of service hours in all of the private contract fixed-route service contracts
as a result of the District-wide reduction in service. The adjustments that were made to the Group
21 and Group 23 contracts resulted in a higher than expected increase in service hours in the Group
21 contract and a lower than expected decrease in the service hours in the Group 23 contract.
Consequently, Veolia (Group 21) was left scrambling to hire additional drivers and First Transit
(Group 23) was faced with the prospect of laying off drivers. RTD agreed to adjust service hours
with the May runboard to bring both contracts closer to service hours that should have been
implemented based upon the percent of overall service reductions that were made in January. At the
present time, the Group 23 service hours have been increased to a level slightly higher than the
hours used to estimate costs for the 2012 budget and the contract will run short of funding by the
end of the year. Conversely, the Group 21 service hours have been reduced below the level used to
estimate costs for the 2012 budget. Therefore, it is recommended that the excess budget dollars in
Group 21 be transferred to Group 23 to provide the additional funding needed for this service
contract for 2012.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
There is no financial impact. The Group 21 service contract currently has budgeted dollars available
to be transferred into the Group 23 service contract.
ALTERNATIVES:
1)
Approve the recommended action item so that funds will be available to pay invoices for
Group 23 service through the end of 2012.
2)
Do not approve the budget transfer. This course of action is not recommended as it will
require staff to locate additional sources for budget funding to pay invoices for Group 23

Interactive Voice Response (IVR) System for
Paratransit and Fixed-Route Information

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into a contract for the development and
implementation of an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system for paratransit (Access-a-Ride) and fixedroute information with Enghouse Transportation LLC for a contract amount not to exceed $829,393.

BACKGROUND
The introduction of an Interactive Voice Response System (IVR) for both the Telephone Information
Center and Access-a-Ride began in part, to enhance the efficiency of the services provided by
simplifying business process integration, increasing flexibility, and providing efficiency gains in network
hosting. IVR is the technology that enables interaction between a caller and a computer via the
telephone. Callers can interact with IVR systems by pressing numbers on a telephone keypad or by
speaking simple commands to answer the computer's voice prompts. IVR technology is most commonly
found in the call centers of companies seeking to improve their customer service, reduce costs, and
expand their call center operations.
Enabled by the successful Proposer, and tightly monitored by RTD staff, IVR will provide:
Access-a-Ride
Intelligent call routing which will allow passengers to reach the right agent every time
Integration with internal application, RouteMatch, to improve call center operations
Expanded ability to get feedback from passengers with surveys that populate our database from the
proposed IVR solution
Reduce idle time in our call center with outbound campaign management
Automated response to “where’s my ride” inquiries
Next day trip reminders
Vehicle arrival reminders
Public announcements
Access-a-Cab processing
Telephone Information Center
Expand the Telephone Information Center’s ability to serve the Districts Customers by offering a texting
“MyStop” option to answer next bus questions.
Allow Customers to build an individual profile allowing easy access to the information they select.
Add a survey option that will allow RTD to query our Customers.
Comprehensive administrative tools and system reporting tools allowing us to maximize the IVR
functionality and to use the data collected to track system performance.

Packet Pg. 15

2.7

Include an advertising component to each text MyStop message allowing RTD to offer this service at no
cost to the Customer or RTD.
The advertising component could potentially develop into a revenue source for RTD.
The benefits of IVR are endless. RTD cannot remain competitive in terms of providing expected
customer service if we do not possess the tools our riders need. Other than on a case-by-case
exception, Access-a-Ride passengers have been advised that it is their responsibility to be ready for their
vehicle at the commencement of their 30-minute pick up window. One of the key benefits of the IVR
system will be the automated process of contacting passengers and giving them notice of the impending
arrival of their vehicle. This will eliminate the need for passengers to wait, sometimes at an
inconvenient location or outside, for up to 30 minutes for their vehicle to arrive. Not only will this
culminate in improved customer service, but it is highly probable that our on time performance will
benefit. Currently, the Access-a-Ride Call Center reserves, schedules, and dispatches over 2700
passenger trips each day. The telephone communications associated with these passenger trips
consume an extremely high amount of resources. The IVR, integrated with our scheduling software,
RouteMatch, will allow us to proactively manage our daily service delivery. The ability to automate
routine calls such as, “Where’s My Ride” inquiries, next-day trip reminders, vehicle arrival reminders, and
the automated processing of Access-a-Cab trips will provide Call Center personnel more time to deal
with calls requiring more detailed interaction. Conducting automated phone surveys will keep us abreast
of trends which may need modifying, and automated public announcements will help keep customers
better informed about Access-a-Ride service. The introduction of IVR to Access-a-Ride will be a
significant technological improvement to the program and will ultimately improve both efficiency and
customer service.
The Telephone Information Center (TIC) has used technology to assist the Customers of the District
while maintaining a static headcount. In 2002 the TIC received 2,289,535 calls. In 2012 the TIC had
its first 5,000,000 call year and 2013 will also exceed 5,000,000 calls. RTD’s existing IVR technology
has been a major contributor to this increase. The addition of a Texting capability will expand our ability
to provide information to our Customers and allow us to reach a new demographic who have grown up
with texting. It will provide operators more time to assist those Customers who have complex route and
scheduling inquiries by further reducing the next bus inquires received by the TIC.
We will also offer our Customers the ability to customize their IVR interaction by selecting a list of
favorites allowing them to ask for information for a stop that they have preselected or that the IVR has
recorded from their past call history.
Finally, the system will also have the ability to survey our callers giving us the ability to check the quality
of the service that our Customers receive when calling the TIC as well as allow RTD to query our
Customers on subjects that are important to us.
DISCUSSION
Three proposals were received in response to RFP 12FH002 for the Interactive Voice Response System
for Paratransit and Fixed-Route Information. Proposals were received from Enghouse Transportation
LLC, LogicTree Corporation, and Unified Dispatch (UDI). The proposals were reviewed by an evaluation
team that consisted of Joe Berdaus, Sr. Manager, Customer Information; Larry Buter, Manager,
Paratransit Services; Carolyn Conover, Sr. Manager, Contracted Services; Beverly Scott, Program
Manager, Information Technology; and David Terada, ITS Systems Administrator. The evaluative criteria
established for this procurement were 1) experience of the team and experience providing proven, similar
technologies (35%), 2) cost (35%), 3) demonstrated understanding of the project (10%), 4) project

approach, including proposed warranty/system support (10%), and 5) project implementation (10%). It
is the recommendation of the evaluation team that RTD award a contract for the IVR system for
paratransit and fixed-route information to Enghouse Transportation LLC.
The members of the evaluation team individually reviewed the technical proposals submitted by the
three proposers. Each team member evaluated the proposals on how well the proposal met the
evaluative criteria set forth for the procurement and assigned a score for “Experience”, “Understanding
of the Project”, “Project Approach” and for “Project Implementation.” Based on the average of the
individual scores received in these categories, LogicTree was the highest rated technical proposal
followed by Enghouse. UDI was the lowest rated technical proposal. The score for the “Cost” element
of each proposal was calculated by the RTD procurement staff and was then added to the technical
score of each proposal to determine the overall score or rating of each proposal. The total overall scores
resulted in Enghouse being the highest rated proposal followed by LogicTree. UDI was the lowest rated
technical proposal and the highest cost proposal. It was the consensus of the evaluation team that
Enghouse presented the best value for the District in terms of the combination of the technical proposal
and the proposed price.
RTD has required that the IVR system be fully functioning, tested and in operation within 180 days from
notice to proceed. Based on the timeline for approval and contract award, it is anticipated that the IVR
system will be operational no later than August, 2013.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The cost for the IVR system is $829,393, which includes hardware, installation and configuration. The
on-going operational costs, without the ad sharing, are approximately $28,000 (price per text based on
500,000/year). Funds for the IVR system are included in the 2012 capital budget. Future year
expenses will be budgeted as needed for on-going operational and maintenance costs in the Information
Technology budget.
A grant will assist in covering $496,925 of the proposed amount.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Award the contract to Enghouse Transportation LLC, as recommended.
2. Do not award a contract. Return the grant money and defer the project. Opportunity costs for
enhancing the rider experience will be deferred. Implementation costs may need to be fully
funded by RTD if grant money is not available in the future.
3. Develop the technology in house. The cost would be equal to or higher and would defer other
projects currently planned. The implementation would be pushed into 2014 or later.

Board Meeting Date: December 11, 2012

Subject:

Award Contract to Supply Sixty-Five (65)
HVAC Units (Including Spares) to Replace the
Existing Units on the SD100 Light Rail Fleet.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is Recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager to award a sole-source contract to Siemens Industry, Inc. Rail Systems,
based in Sacramento, California to supply sixty-five complete HVAC units. These units will be used to
replace the units currently installed on the SD100 Light Rail Fleet.

BACKGROUND
The RTD currently operates forty-nine SD100 Light Rail Cars. This was the first model of vehicles
purchased in four orders for our light rail service. The refrigerant used in these HVAC units on the first
thirty-one vehicles is being phased out due to EPA regulation changes and will not be available for
purchase within the next few years. These units were built by another vendor and have been a
maintenance problem for quite some time including a fleet failure situation where Siemens stepped in to
honor the warranty that another vendor had rejected. This purchase will make all HVAC units the same
and will offer fleet wide component interchangeability and compatibility. Salt Lake City (UTA) replaced
similar ones within the first two years of operation.
DISCUSSION
We have received a very favorable quote from Siemens for HVAC, Frames and Inverter units, which
includes freight, for all sixty-five (65) not to exceed $4,615,000.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The funding for this contract is part of the 2013 budget.
DBE PARTICIPATION
There is no DBE requirement for this HVAC system procurement.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the General Manager to award a contract to Siemens Industry, Inc. Rail Systems to
build and supply sixty-five (65) HVAC units. This is the recommended alternative.
2. Do not authorize the award of the contract and solicit proposals. This is not desirable as it would
result in a substantial delay in the acquisition of the HVAC equipment may result in substantially
duplicated costs (R & D) since there are no other suppliers for these units.

A-Line Cost Share Agreement

RECOMMENDED ACTION
No action required. This report provides information regarding cost share agreements that are within the
General Manager’s authority of $250,000. This agreement is for calendar year 2013 and shall be in an
amount not to exceed $173,891.00.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board
of
Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter
into an Agreement with
Ride Provide to provide RTD support for the A-Line operations. This agreement
is for calendar year 2013 and shall be in an amount not to exceed $173,891.00.
BACKGROUND
In February of 2003, the RTD Board of Directors approved the discontinuation of service on the skyRide
Route AS beyond the Stapleton transfer station due to low ridership at the Olde Town Arvada and Ward
Road park-n-Rides. As a result of this action, interested parties in the City of Arvada developed a
business plan to implement scheduled shuttle van service to be operated directly between the Olde
Town Arvada park-n-ride and Denver International Airport (DIA). The proposed business plan called for
the provision of scheduled shuttle van service, the A-Line, to be operated between Arvada and DIA. This
service was implemented May 11, 2003 to coincide with the elimination of AS service to Arvada.
DISCUSSION
The A-Line service was specifically created to fill the void left by the Route AS. Ride Provide, the
operator of the A-Line service, has six vans and twenty two employees that provide this service. Ride
Provide has proven to be a reliable, consistent and efficient transportation provider. The A-Line will
operate until the Gold Line and East Line are in place and can provide an airport service to the
community.
FY2009 boardings – 35,350, passengers per hour – 3.1, subsidy per passenger - $4.64.
FY2010 boardings – 37,302, passengers per hour – 3.3, subsidy per passenger - $4.54.
FY2011 boardings – 40,028, passengers per hour – 3.5, subsidy per passenger - $4.22.
FY2012 boardings (thru 3rd Qtr) – 30,655, passengers per hour – 3.8, subsidy per passenger - $4.13.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for RTD support of this agreement was included in the approved 2013 RTD budget. This
Agreement will be for a period of one year. Nothing herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this
Agreement.

Cost Share Agreements Under $250,000

RECOMMENDED ACTION
No action required. This report provides information regarding cost share agreements that are within the
General Manager’s authority of $250,000.

BACKGROUND
These agreements are currently approved by the General Manager. This report has been generated for
informational purposes only.
DISCUSSION
Littleton Shopping Cart $27,823 for 2013. Since January 1992, the RTD has contributed to support
the Littleton Shopping Cart which was originated to serve portions of certain routes previously served by
RTD. The Shopping Cart is a free service available to the residents of Littleton. FY2012 (thru 3 rd Qtr)
boardings = 9,054; passengers per hour = 7.2; subsidy per passenger = $2.24.
Focus Points Family Resource Center (FPFRC) $48,000 for 2013. In January 2004, the RTD
discontinued the Route 47 and as an alternative the RTD entered into an agreement for a local non-profit
to provide a new community based service. In 2011, RTD entered into an agreement with FPFRC for
the provision of this service as the previous provider, Cross Community Coalition, had filed for
bankrupty. FPFRC has long been an advocate and resource for communities in Denver. FY2012
boardings (thru 3rd Qtr) = 4708; passengers per hour = 3.8; subsidy per passenger = $9.88.
Longmont Coordination of Services $15,000 for 2013. In January 2010, Via Mobility, a nonprofit
organization, applied for and received a Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century New Freedom
grant to coordinate transportations services provided by Via Mobility and RTD in the city of Longmont.
Currently Via Mobility and RTD are providing overlapping services in the Longmont community. This
grant will allow both agencies to coordinate services in a more efficient trial program. Local matches of
the grant will be provided by Via Mobility, the City of Longmont and the RTD.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for RTD support of these agreements were included in the approved 2013 RTD budget. These
Agreements will be for a period of one year. Nothing herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend these
Agreements.

CALL-N-RIDE SERVICE
Preventable Accidents:
1st Qtr – 0 Accidents
2nd Qtr – 0 Accidents
3rd Qtr – 0 Accidents
Total YTD at 3rd Quarter = 0 Accidents
Customer Contacts:
Contacts include both positive and negative comments made by customers regarding the operator.
1st Qtr – 155 Contacts (120 associated with S. Jeffco)
2nd Qtr – 39 Contacts
3rd Qtr – 62 Contacts (Increase due to schools starting, customers cannot get their desired ride)
Total YTD at 3rd Quarter = 256 Contacts
Call-n-Ride Comments:
Highlands Ranch - began operating in November 2006. Operates Weekday service. Call-n-Ride replaced
the fixed route RanchRider service which was discontinued due to low ridership. Over the years
Saturday service was discontinued due to low ridership, and weekday service was adjusted to stop
operating at 6:00pm rather than 8:00pm. This 2 hour reduction has the lowest ridership of the day.
Numerous marketing campaigns have taken place in the community. At one of the RTD Public Hearings
in 2010, over 30 Access-a-Ride customers commented that they would start using Access-a-Ride for
local trips if this Call-n-Ride was discontinued. Accordingly, it was determined that continuation of the
Call-n-Ride would result in an overall lower cost to the RTD.
Lone Tree – began operating in January 2004. Operates Weekday service. This Call-n-Ride has always
met the minimum passenger boardings per hour until recently. The Call-n-Ride operators are making a
concentrated effort to increase ridership.
Longmont - began operating in February 2001. Operates Weekday, Saturday & Sunday service. Call-nRide has had numerous changes and marketing attempts to increase ridership over the years. Weekday
ridership has had difficulty staying above the minimum standard of 3 passenger boardings per hour.
Service hours reduced over the years. RTD and City of Longmont Staff have worked together to
increase ridership. In October 2010, RTD, the City of Longmont and VIA Mobility (operator of the Calln-Ride and nonprofit services for seniors/disabled in Boulder County) began a project program to
coordinate services between the Call-n-Ride services and VIA’s non-profit services. The coordination
program has had numerous hurdles to overcome but overall ridership has increased and we continue to
work out the problems of coordinating services between agencies.

Parker – began operating November 2006. Operates Weekday service. In May 2008, Saturday service
was discontinued due to low ridership. Additionally, weekday service was adjusted to stop operating at
6:00pm rather than 8:00pm. This 2 hour reduction has the lowest ridership of the day.
Minor
boundary adjustments have also been made. Extensive marketing has been done for this Call-n-Ride.
RTD and Parker staff have worked on increasing the ridership. The Town of Parker offered free rides
(the Town reimbursed the RTD for all passenger fares) to the community from June 15th through the end
of September, 2012. The boardings did increase during the promotional period.
South Thornton – began operating in January 2004. Operates Weekday service. The Call-n-Ride
operators are making a concentrated effort to increase ridership. Will look at marketing efforts in early
2013.

3'd Quarter 2012 Security Statistics & Fare Inspection Summary

Fare Enforcement Statistics
Fare inspectors, security officers, street supervisors, and police officers, conduct fare
inspection on-board buses and light rail vehicles. RTD's policy is to provide a warning to
first time offenders and then to issue a citation if that person is contacted a second time
without fare. The table below shows the actual number of patrons without fare that
resulted in warnings or citations. The variation in numbers from month to month may be
due to several factors: special events or other security security-related incidents.

Light Rail Station Sweeps and on-Board Enforcement Sweeps
In addition to the regular on-board fare enforcement, G4S Security officers conduct
random, unannounced fare checks at light rail platforms twice a week. Below are the
numbers of patrons contacted during the quarter. Any area that exhibits a higher fare
evasion rate, we go back to that area and conduct an on-board enforcement sweep.

Our mission:
To meet our constituents' present and future public transit needs by offering safe, clean,
reliable, courteous, accessible and cost-effective service throughout the District.

3.4.a

The following tables summarize information for the months of July, August, and
September. These tables lists the number of patron boardings observed, no fare or partial
fares, the estimated fare evasion rate, the number of warnings and citations issued, and
the number of arrests made by police officers. Arrests include citations issued or physical
arrests made for criminal violations other than fare evasion. This is an additional
advantage to the plain clothes police fare inspection program as peace officers have the
authority to check for warrants and take the appropriate law enforcement action. This
quarter the bus routes inspected include the 15, 16, 31 & 0.

The below chart shows the plain clothes police fare enforcement observations for light rail.
There is a slightly higher fare evasion rate observed by the plain clothes program than for
the rail station sweeps and bus enforcement because of the following factors:
• Fare station sweeps are conducted by uniformed security officers; these officers
require all patrons to have fare before boarding vehicles
• Rail operators do not have any interface with patrons, while bus operators do ask
for fare
• Plain clothes police officers do not have a deterrence factor as uniformed officers,
thus they inherently find more violations of fare evasion.

Plain Clothes Police Officer Fare Inspection
Denver Police Officers are placed on bus and rail vehicles that have been identified by
operators, supervisors, dispatch logs and patrons as having a high perception of fare
evasion, fare disputes or other problems.

G4S Security Officer Use of Force Incidents
Use of Force is defined as any hands on touching of a suspect by a security officer to
detain a suspect or make a citizen's arrest. The majority of these issues are minor in
nature. No injuries to any suspect or officer occurred in this reporting quarter. The
following table summarizes the use of force incidents per month.

G4S Overtime Hours
RTD closely monitors the hours of overtime worked by security officers. There were no
occurrences in which security officers worked more than 60 hours in a week. We also
monitor an intermediate category of officers working over 56 hours in a week for tracking
purposes. The average overtime hours reported in the table below represent the average
number of overtime hours per week per security officer based on the total number of
overtime hours and the total number of officers.

Fare Enforcement Statistics
Fare inspectors, security officers, street supervisors, and police officers, conduct fare
inspection on-board buses and light rail vehicles. RTD’s policy is to provide a warning to
first time offenders and then to issue a citation if that person is contacted a second time
without fare. The table below shows the actual number of patrons without fare that
resulted in warnings or citations. The variation in numbers from month to month may be
due to several factors: special events or other security security-related incidents.

Light Rail Station Sweeps and on-Board Enforcement Sweeps
In addition to the regular on-board fare enforcement, G4S Security officers conduct
random, unannounced fare checks at light rail platforms twice a week. Below are the
numbers of patrons contacted during the quarter. Any area that exhibits a higher fare
evasion rate, we go back to that area and conduct an on-board enforcement sweep.

The following tables summarize information for the months of July, August, and
September. These tables lists the number of patron boardings observed, no fare or partial
fares, the estimated fare evasion rate, the number of warnings and citations issued, and
the number of arrests made by police officers. Arrests include citations issued or physical
arrests made for criminal violations other than fare evasion. This is an additional
advantage to the plain clothes police fare inspection program as peace officers have the
authority to check for warrants and take the appropriate law enforcement action. This
quarter the bus routes inspected include the 15, 16, 31 & 0.

The below chart shows the plain clothes police fare enforcement observations for light rail.
There is a slightly higher fare evasion rate observed by the plain clothes program than for
the rail station sweeps and bus enforcement because of the following factors:
 Fare station sweeps are conducted by uniformed security officers; these officers
require all patrons to have fare before boarding vehicles
 Rail operators do not have any interface with patrons, while bus operators do ask
for fare
 Plain clothes police officers do not have a deterrence factor as uniformed officers,
thus they inherently find more violations of fare evasion.

RTD closely monitors the hours of overtime worked by security officers. There were no
occurrences in which security officers worked more than 60 hours in a week. We also
monitor an intermediate category of officers working over 56 hours in a week for tracking
purposes. The average overtime hours reported in the table below represent the average
number of overtime hours per week per security officer based on the total number of
overtime hours and the total number of officers.

Third Quarter Report Paratransit Services

Information

Ridership
Access-a-Ride ridership and revenue hours increased slightly through the 3rd quarter of 2012 as
compared to the same period of 2011. In addition, productivity increased from 1.23 to 1.26 passengers
per hour. During the same period, Access-a-Cab ridership increased by 12%. The increased use of
Access-a-Cab by Access-a-Ride passengers continues to allow RTD to provide increased service without
an increase in resources. Combined Access-a-Ride and Access-a-Cab ridership increased 3% compared
to the same period last year.
Revenue Hours
Revenue hours of service provided on Access-a-Ride increased slightly (approximately 1%) from the 3rd
quarter of 2011 through Q3 2012. Access-a-Ride is approximately 7% under budgeted revenue hours
through the third quarter of 2012.
On-Time Performance
On time performance through the third quarter of 2012 was 96%, which matched the same levels of Q3
2011. Our private contractors continue to address on time performance challenges in order to continue
meeting this standard of performance.
Customer Complaints
Complaints per passenger did not increase through the 3rd quarter of 2012 as compared to the same
period in 2011. Complaints per passenger were maintained at .0010. The highest number of
complaints received related to on-time performance. Staff is continuing to work to address this issue
with the service providers.

An analysis of this report confirms that the highest percentage of complaints relate to our
On Time Performance. There are several steps that staff is continuing to undertake in
order to improve this performance standard. First, we continue to meet with carrier
dispatch personnel and developing policies and procedures that will assist the call center
with driver call offs and trips redistribution. In addition, the enforcement of our 6 minute
boarding policy which asks passengers to board their vehicle within 6 minutes of its arrival
within their pick up window has improved overall on time performance.

The following chart outlines the number and type of complaints filed against the Access-aRide Service per Provider.

3.5.c

Access-a-Ride
This is a listing and description of reviews conducted for the purpose of evaluating the ADA Access-aRide Paratransit Service.
Accident, Incident, Breakdown (AIB) Timeliness
This review is handled via the AIB Tracking form. This is reviewed monthly for timely submittal.
The AIB form is submitted by the Contractor within three business days of event, not including
the date of incident.
Call Center-Conditional Eligibility
This review evaluates whether the First Transit Customer Service Representatives have booked a
trip according to the customer’s given certification eligibility conditions. These conditions are
based on individual needs identified at intake during Certification Eligibility at Easter Seals of
Colorado.
Types of Eligibility Status












Unrestricted – Full service for up to four (4) years.
Conditional – Any conditions applied to service is done on an individual basis depending on the
needs of the passenger. The various conditions used are as follows:
Temperature Sensitive-If, as part of the eligibility process, it has been determined that a customer
may only use Access-a-Ride services during identified weather conditions, Temperature Sensitive
condition shall be applied. Based on the specific temperature range given during the eligibility
process they may only use Access-a-Ride only when the outside temperature falls within the range.
The weather is tracked by www.weather.gov to verify the weather conditions for the day and hours
that are requested. Passengers with “Temperature Sensitive condition may only schedule one (1)
day in advance.
Dawn to Dusk-Service will be available after sunrise and up until sunset.
Dusk to Dawn-Service will be available after sunset and up until sunrise of the following day.
Snow-If snow accumulation is the only factor that prevents a customer from getting to and from a
bus stop, we will offer them Access-a-Ride service on the day it snows and for seven (7) days that
follow. Again, the FTCC call center will use weather reports from www.weather.gov to verify that
there is at least a 30% chance that it will snow on the day you need a ride. Passengers with “Snow”
condition must call one (1) day in advance for all trip requests.
Rain-If the possibility of rain causing damage to a power chair is the issue affecting the customer
getting to and from a bus stop, we will offer them Access-a-Ride during rain. The Access-a-Ride call
center will use weather reports from www.weather.gov to verify that there is at least a 30% chance
that it will rain on the day you need a ride. Passengers with “Rain” condition may only request trips
one (1) day in advance.
Fatigue- These passengers are allowed to use Access-a-Ride services when their fatigue limits their
ability to use the fixed route system. Passengers with “Fatigue” condition must call one (1) day in
advance for all trip requests.

3.5.c

In this review, many of the infractions involve the FTCC Customer Service Representative not booking
correctly for Infrequent Trips. This condition was given to customers requesting service needing to
learn new bus routes. The FTCC CSR was required to review the trip history for the requesting
customer and only offer a trip to a single location no more than four times. This is no longer given
as an eligibility condition as it was found that the customers were unable to learn the bus route while
riding on Access-a-Ride.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: December 6, 2012

From:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

December 4, 2012

Board Meeting Date: December 11, 2012

Subject:

Third Quarter Customer Complaint Analysis

Information

RTD staff, as well as the private contractors, address and monitor customer complaints on a daily basis.
Recapped below is an analysis of the customer complaint trends for the 3nd quarter of 2012. Also
included is a comparison of customer complaint data for the years 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011.
In 2007 and 2008, RTD and the private contractors were consistently meeting the performance goal for
customer complaints of .0002 complaints per passenger boarding. In 2009, RTD began stricter
enforcement of the fare policy and implemented a new stroller policy which advised passengers with
strollers that they would need to move from the priority seating area if those seats were needed for
disabled passengers. In addition, RTD posted notices on all buses and light rail vehicles advising
passengers of the requirement under Title VI of the Civil Rights Law for operators to call out transfer
points. Following the implementation of these policies/procedures, customer complaints increased, but
have held steady in 2009, 2010, and 2011 at a level of .0003 to .0004 complaints per passenger
boarding. In 2012, the performance goal for passenger complaints was adjusted to .0003 complaints
per passenger boarding. As of the 3rd quarter of 2012, RTD and First Transit Longmont are meeting the
goal. First Transit Commerce City, First Transit Denver and Veolia are running between .0004 and
.0005 complaints per passenger boarding.
RTD and the private contractors investigate all customer complaints using a variety of tools, including
CAD/AVL playbacks and video review and address/discipline operators as needed. Many times the
results of the investigation reveal that the complaint is not valid. Some of the reasons for the “Not
Valid” classification include the following:
Bus is on time per playback
Operator followed proper procedure
Passenger presented insufficient fare
Passenger had no proof of eligibility
Passenger presented an expired transfer
Passenger presented a counterfeit pass
All buses running late due to a snow day
There was no video evidence to support the complaint
RTD and the private contractors continue to work collectively in a variety of different areas to address
customer complaints.
 Bus routes with poor on-time performance are monitored by both RTD and private contractor
personnel to determine if the problem is related to the operator or the running time of the route.
 Meetings are held on a monthly basis with contractor and RTD personnel to discuss challenges,
solutions and best practices in the areas of bus maintenance, operations, safety and training.
 Bus operator trainers from RTD and the private contractors meet weekly in an effort to ensure
consistency in training messages and practices.

Packet Pg. 57

3.6



RTD conducts refresher training for all operators on an annual basis that includes a focus on
customer service. The private contractors conduct monthly safety meetings that also include a
segment on improving customer service.
RTD and private contractor trainers spend time at Civic Center Station and Market Street Station
the first week of each runboard to provide assistance to operators who may need some
refreshers on station procedures or have questions on their routes.
RTD has also reached out to the disability community (Colorado School of the Blind, Atlantis) to
get feedback on ways to improve RTD service for disabled passengers.
Operators are recognized for the good customer service they provide. Divisions post
commendations on a bulletin board in the drivers’ room and some provide additional means of
recognition.

Complaint Categories Generating the Highest Number of Complaints
Historically, and in 2012, the following complaint categories generate the highest number of customer
complaints:
Bus Did Not Show
Bus Early
Bus Late
Careless Driving/Operator
Discourtesy/Operator
Improper Procedure By Operator
Passed Up Passenger At Stop
All of these complaint categories are what RTD considers “operator related” and are included in the
complaint numbers that are tracked and reported to the Board of Directors on the Quarterly Performance
Report.
The high complaint categories were reviewed to determine the factors, both internal and external, that
were impacting the number of complaints. The input received from both RTD and private contractor
operations is noted below:
Bus Did Not Show – There was a noticeable increase in this category in the first quarter of 2012 which,
in many cases, can be tied to the service reductions effective with the January runboard changes as
operators attempted to transport the same number of riders on fewer and/or less frequent routes. In
many cases, CAD/AVL playbacks confirm that buses are on route, but running late. However, from the
passenger’s perspective, the bus did not show.
Bus Early – Playbacks for “bus early” complaints often show buses running late. It is possible
passengers see the prior bus running late and assume it is their bus running early. On-time performance
statistics for the 3rd quarter of 2012 show just 3.3% of all time point observations were in the “early”
category.
Bus Late – There was a noticeable increase in this category in the first quarter of 2012 which, in many
cases, can be tied to the service reductions effective with the January runboard changes as operators
attempted to transport the same number of riders on fewer and/or less frequent routes. Improving ontime performance continues to be a challenge for a variety of reasons including construction, traffic and
heavy ridership delays; service reductions, which result in the same number of passengers on fewer
trips; and the inability to fund service improvements to address running-time issues.

Packet Pg. 58

3.6

Careless Driving/Operator – On a regular basis, video recordings are reviewed to determine if operators
are driving in an unsafe or inappropriate manner. In addition, all of the private contractors have “G-force
activated” video recording systems (Drive Cam, Smart Drive) installed on their buses. These incidents
are also reviewed on a daily basis. Operators continue to be counseled and retrained as needed to
improve driving performance.
Discourtesy/Operator – In the majority of cases, the investigation into these complaints proves the
operator not at fault. Video evidence usually confirms that the operator followed proper procedures and
treated the customer with respect. In many cases, operators are shown enforcing policies (fares,
strollers, inappropriate behavior) in a polite and respectful manner and the passengers react in a negative
manner. Operators are counseled and disciplined if video evidence confirms that they treated
passengers in a discourteous or inappropriate manner. Operators are also given suggestions for handling
similar situations in the future.
Discrimination – This category was created in 2009 to track complaints related to Title VI issues. The
3rd quarter 2012 statistics show complaints in this category average 14 per month for RTD and the
private contractors combined. Again, investigation into these complaints usually shows the operator not
at fault.
Fare Dispute – This category showed dramatic increases in 2009 and 2010 following the renewed
enforcement of the RTD fare policy. 2011 numbers were consistent with 2010, and the average
number of complaints in 2012 shows a slight decline from 2011. Many complaints indicate passengers
are simply not happy with the operators’ enforcement of the fare policies.
Improper Procedure/Operator – Some of these complaints are related to the enforcement of the fare
policies. Other complaints relate to the issues that arise when disabled passengers and passengers with
strollers compete for use of the priority seating area. RTD and the private contractors are in the process
of developing a campaign to 1) provide additional customer service tools to help operators handle these
conflicts and 2) to encourage all passengers to share the priority seating area so that everyone has the
opportunity to ride.
Incorrect Info/Operator –This category was tracked to identify possible trends with operators providing
incorrect information to passengers. The total numbers in this category remain small (an average of 12
complaints per month for 2012), which indicates this area is not a problem.
Passed Up Passenger At Stop – Oftentimes, playbacks for these complaints will confirm buses are on
route and on time. It is possible the passenger was not directly at the stop when the bus arrived.
Operators are reminded to stay vigilant and watch for passengers that may not be waiting directly at the
bus stop.

RTD experienced reporting difficulties with its TrapezeCom complaint tracking software in 2011. A
number of complaints for some of the operating divisions could not be captured in the summary reports.
The problem was identified and corrected in 2012. However, some of the complaint data for 2011 was
lost. Consequently, the 2011 statistics reported in the comparison summary below are understated and
do not reflect a true and accurate representation of the total complaints received for the year or the
average number of complaints received per month.

Contracted Fixed-Route Quarterly Report – 3rd Quarter 2012

The following is a discussion of the performance measures for the third quarter of 2012
for the fixed-route services provided by private contractors:


PREVENTABLE VEHICLE ACCIDENTS PER 100,000 MILES
The contractors individually and as a group met the target of ≤ 2.0 Preventable
Vehicle Accidents per 100,000 miles in the 3rd quarter. First Transit and Veolia
Transportation continue to utilize bus operator monitoring technology and postaccident investigations for retraining of operators. The contractors continue to
emphasize safety with all employees at monthly safety meetings, through periodic
campaigns, and with daily reminders at their facilities.



PASSENGER ACCIDENT RATIO PER 100,000 MILES
The contractors as a group did not meet the target of ≤ 0.18 Passenger Accidents
per 100,000 miles in the 3rd quarter. First Transit Commerce City and Veolia
Transportation did not meet this goal for 3rd quarter; however, none of the
passenger accidents during 1st, 2nd and 3rd quarters 2012 were classified as
preventable. First Transit and Veolia Transportation continue to conduct proactive
retraining to increase operator awareness of passenger mobility issues to reduce the
number of passenger accidents per 100,000 miles. Increased passenger awareness
training continues to be a primary focus for all contractors in this area.



ON-TIME PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE INSPECTIONS
The contractors, individually and as a group, met the target of 98% of Preventive
Maintenance Inspections completed as scheduled in the 3rd quarter. The
contractor organizations place a high emphasis on completing preventive
maintenance inspections as required, and as such, the local operations are diligent
about completing these inspections on time.

Attachment: 2012 Qtr 3 CS review (1433 : 3Rd Quarter Report Fixed Route Contracted Services)

Memorandum



ON-TIME PERFORMANCE
The contractors individually and as a group did not meet the target of 88.0% Local
On-Time Service in the 3rd quarter. First Transit Denver, First Transit Longmont
and Veolia did show improvements in OTP during the 3rd quarter. RTD is working
with the private contractors to use the OTP performance report to identify and
campaign routes with on-time performance issues. The contractors report that they
continue to experience route delays due to construction and detours. Increased
passenger loads and associated boarding delays also contribute to running behind
schedule. The contractors continue to address on-time performance issues with
operators, but always tie safety to the discussion. It’s better to be a few minutes
late than to have an accident.



MILES BETWEEN LOST SERVICE ROAD CALLS
The contractors as a group exceeded the target of 26,000 Miles Between Lost
Service Maintenance Road Calls in the 3rd quarter. Veolia did not meet the goal,
but monthly statistics continue to show they are improving in this area. RTD Staff
is closely monitoring Veolia’s improvement to ensure continued progress is made.



OPERATOR COMPLAINTS PER BOARDING
The contractors, individually and as a group, did not meet the target of .0002
Complaints per Boarding. The complaint categories generating the largest number
of complaints include buses running late, improper procedure by operator, careless
driving, discourteous operators and passing up passengers at stops. The “Bus
Early” and “Fare Dispute” categories showed decreases in the third quarter
compared to the second quarter of 2012. The “Discourtesy Operator” category
continued to show an increase in the third quarter. A large number of
“Discourtesy” complaints relate to the operator enforcing the fare policy. The
contractors continue to reinforce the importance of good customer service with all
operators at monthly safety meetings and individually as a part of the complaint
investigation process.

Smart Card Project Status Update

Information

INTRODUCTION
Vehicle installations are underway at all RTD and Private Carrier divisions to complete the last 4% of
buses that have not been started. Installation contractor (Blackfeet Lighting) has been unable to
maintain the planned installation rates to maintain the original schedule primarily due to missing
equipment, understaffed installation crews, and schedule reliability issues. Xerox has brought on an
additional Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) Contractor (Linkmont) to help ensure the installations
are completed by mid-December and minimize the impact on the CAD/AVL project.
Light Rail Validators are installed at all Central Corridor stations and nine other stations. Southeast and
Southwest Corridor station installations are currently underway with an estimated completion date of
December 15th. The RTD Network Team and SCADA Team are working together to connect the
validators to the existing network for the Ticket Vending Machines (TVM) to accept credit cards by 2nd
Quarter 2013. Validators for West Corridor and expansion of existing stations, as needed, have been
ordered and are expected to be delivered in March, 2013.
450,000 cards have been ordered. Printing and distribution of the cards began the week of October 8th.
Ecopass Employers will have the option of printing their own cards (Self-Administration) or submitting
photos to RTD and having the cards produced and mailed back. Employers that have chosen to have
RTD print the cards for them have uploaded their files to RTD and they are currently being processed.
CU Boulder, Auraria Campus, and CU Anchutz submitted their data in October and the passes are in the
process of being printed and are expected to be delivered the first week in December. Although the
schedule will be tight, the distribution of the cards is achievable by December 31st.
Marketing materials are in development and progressing as planned. Over 1,100 shifts of volunteer
ambassadors have been filled and scheduled. Ambassador training is being conducted and the
ambassadors will be out on the stations beginning mid-December to start education riders and be onhand through mid-January to assist customers locating and using the validators at Light Rail Stations.
The web portal and final system configuration have been accepted. Xerox has been directed to dedicate
all resources to completing the portions required for the EcoPass, CollegePass, & Neighborhood Pass
first and then complete the remaining system for the 2013 rollout of Stored Value & Passes. Final
Acceptance Testing for Phase I (EcoPass, Neighborhood Pass, and CollegePass) will occur December
17th, 2012. Daily status calls are conducted with the entire team to ensure everything is in order to golive January 2, 2012.
Xerox and INIT have been working together to finalize a single driver control. The INIT CAD/AVL
interface will contain the screens needed to control the Smart Card Equipment. This integration will
offer the driver a simpler and more streamlined approach to CAD/AVL and Smart Card. This successful

Packet Pg. 69

integration reduces overall operating and maintenance expenses and increases the driver convenience
with the completion of a true “smart bus”.
The Board has previously approved several fare changes and administrative policies regarding the
implementation of Smart Card. The Smart Card Program Team will continue to add policy and
procedures to this list and distribute to The Board as needed (no updates this month)
