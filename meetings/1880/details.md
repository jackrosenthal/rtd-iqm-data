#### 1. Citizens Advisory Committee Update

Committee Chair Hoy recognized Hugh Wilson, Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) Co-Chair.  Hugh Wilson introduced the Board to Cyndi Stovall, the new CAC Co-Chair.  He recognized former Co-Chair David Lewis for his hard work over the past two years.  Hugh Wilson thanked the Board for their attendance at the CAC Meeting in December.

Cyndi Stovall shared that they had their first work session of the year on January 15, 2014.  In addition to electing the new Co-Chair the CAC also welcomed three new members: Tyler Kealy, Vivian Stovall and Darcy Wilson.  She shared that the Committee discussed various topics and tours that they would like to focus on over the coming year and how they might align each meeting topic with appropriate project milestones.  Cyndi Stovall said that the CAC plans to host their quarterly meetings at various locations around the District also to align with project milestones.  She stated that per the Committee’s direction, Roger Sherman is working to schedule two-on-one meetings with the Board to learn how they can best promote the FasTracks objectives while gaining public input.

Committee Chair Hoy thanked Cyndi Stovall for her update.  He thought she did a very good job.  He also recognized the work that David Lewis did during his time as CAC Co-Chair.

#### 2. FasTracks Public Information Update

Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager of Communications, reminded the Board that the Communications Department has been working to change their structure and focus to utilize our resources in the best manner possible as FasTracks moves from construction to operations.  He said that based on this, at the end of last year he did an internal and external recruitment for the new position of Senior Manager of Public Relations and Public Information and Pauletta Tonilas was selected.  He shared that he is excited to have her in an expanded role that will be important as RTD moves forward with the transition of FasTracks.

Pauletta Tonilas reminded the Board that the Communications Department comes to the Board every quarter with an update.  She stated that this evening’s update was focusing on the FasTracks Campaign that staff worked on to integrated RTD’s PI, PR and Marketing divisions.  She said that the goal of the campaign was to connect the base system with FasTracks to show how these will grow together to form RTD’s operations.  The campaign is called “I am FasTracks. I am RTD.”  Pauletta Tonilas believes it is very important to make sure that people know that RTD and FasTracks are really connected as there are people that think FasTracks is a CDOT or City of Denver project.

Pauletta Tonilas recognized Joni Goheen, Steve Reilly, Cheryl Holmes, Kate Wilson and Deborah Menendez-Wilson for their work on the campaign.

Steve Reilly explained that in working on the campaign, Marketing really wanted to create a greater synergy with RTD and FasTracks.  He shared that it was important to personalize the experience by telling real stories about real people and the positive impacts that FasTracks and RTD have had on their lives.

Steve Reilly shared that this campaign is featured in a variety of different media such as on our vehicle, the website, and various local publications.  He said that every few months the campaign will be refreshed with new individuals.

Pauletta Tonilas recognized the campaign participants who were in the audience: Nettie Moore, Karina Sartiaguin, Chanda Hinton, Beverly Grant and Cha Cha Cruz as well as RTD staff members Joe Christie and Jerry Nery.  She also recognized Ed and Maro Dimmer who were unable to attend as they gave all their employees the night off due to weather.  She said that staff is really appreciative of the collaborative nature that occurred during this campaign.

Steve Reilly thanked everyone for being so wonderful and gracious.  He stated that these individuals have a passion, energy and enthusiasm for RTD and public transportation.

Pauletta Tonilas shared that this year’s annual FasTracks video dovetails nicely with the “I am FasTracks. I am RTD” campaign.  She thanked Michelle Brier along with Joni Goheen and Dave Mitchell for their work on this video.  She said that the video would be distributed through YouTube, available on the FasTracks website, and would also be sent to the various local TV media outlets.

Staff played the video for the Board which is available from the FasTracks website.

Committee Chair Hoy said that he has not had the opportunity to meet all of the participants but he did meet Nettie Moore on the W-Line opening day.  He said that she was absolutely delightful and this video really brought a smile to his face.

Director Anderson shared that her first recollection of Edward Dimmer is when he would leave his parents’ bakery to pick up flour, sugar, etc.  She said that after she was elected to the Arvada City Council, she and Mr. Dimmer worked very hard to make Olde Town what it is today.  Director Anderson noted that Olde Town Arvada was home to the first King Soopers started by Lloyd King.  In recognition of him the Arvada Economic Development Council gives the Lloyd King Entrepreneurial Award each year.  She informed the Board that Edward and Maro Dimmer received the award last year.  Director Anderson believes they are great citizens of Arvada and truly represent FasTracks.

Director Folska feels this is a wonderful effort and a very dynamic presentation.  She asked if the intent of this video is to be educational and teach people how to use the base system.  She also asked if the video was multimodal, showing buses and Smart Cards.  Pauletta Tonilas explained that the video is not to teach people how to use the system but to educate them about the tie between RTD and FasTracks.  She said that there were buses in the video but it did not include the Smart Card system.  Director Folska encouraged staff to add that to the video as she believes it is important.  Scott Reed said that staff does plan on including Smart Cards in future videos; the goal of this was to turn the focus to our projects as they come online.  He noted that the video did show numerous components that have been completed to date.

Director Folska wonders if the video really represent the disabled community.  She stated that people with disabilities use our system and should be in all our marketing collateral.  Scott Reed informed her that one of the riders featured in the video is disabled.  Director Folska noted that if a blind individual was listening to this video they would not be able to read about the information Scott Reed mentioned nor would they know a disabled rider was featured because it is not obvious; they cannot see him.  Pauletta Tonilas said that staff will see what they can do; they have discussed compiling a transcript of all the video’s text to include on our website and YouTube.

Director Daly thinks this video is a great candidate for the APTA AdWheel awards.  He believes it was a great video.

Director Rivera-Malpiede shared how pleased she was to see the diversity of the people in this video.  She said that she has to brag about District C’s most famous person, Nettie Moore, who has lived in District C since 1924.  She thanked Nettie Moore for participating.  Director Rivera-Malpiede believes it is such an honor to have her in the video.

Committee Chair Hoy asked where the campaign would be disseminated.  Pauletta Tonilas said that it will be on our website, bus and light rail vehicles, and ads in the local community papers.  She noted that the full stories are featured on our website so we can include more detail.

#### 1. Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) Member Appointment

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors appoint one member to the FasTracks Citizens Advisory Committee of the Regional Transportation District (RTD) to fill a vacancy on the Committee.

Motion:              Director Folska made the motion to move this item to the February 18, 2014 Board meeting.

Director Rivera-Malpiede seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager of Planning, explained that this is a recommendation to fill an upcoming vacancy on the CAC.  He said that member Steve Lawrence submitted his resignation effective February 19, 2014 due to his pending deployment with the Peace Corps.  Bill Van Meter noted that when RTD last did our solicitation for CAC members the nominating committee identified two alternate candidates.  He said staff is recommending that the Board approve the recommendation of Hannah Polow to fill the vacancy through the end of December 31, 2014.

Committee Chair Hoy declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

#### 2. Authorization for Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with the City and County of Denver (CCD) for the Free MetroRide

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with the City and County of Denver (CCD), for the maintenance of roadway and street furniture improvements constructed for the operation of the Free MetroRide, formerly known as the Downtown Denver Circulator (Circulator).

Motion:              Director Lubow made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the February 18, 2014 Board meeting.

Director Rivera-Malpiede seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Henry Stopplecamp, Senior Manager of Engineering, explained that this recommendation is only approving the IGA with CCD; it is not approving the Free MetroRide.

Director Anderson noted that the citizens of her community have helped pay for Denver Union Station (DUS), the 16th Street Mall Shuttle and the Free MetroRide.  She informed the Board that her citizens are going to have their commutes times extended when buses move from Market Street Station.  She expressed that she is in favor of this IGA with CCD but wants to make it clear that her community is expecting bus rides to help with their extended travel time.

Director Deadwyler asked for clarification on what the IGA covers.  Henry Stopplecamp said that as part of the Free MetroRide RTD is installing bus shelters, bus bulbs, etc. on CCD’s property; this IGA includes the right to do so.  He explained that RTD will be subbing our the snow removal, maintenance, etc. to CCD and reimbursing them $10K annually for this work.

Director Folska wondered the cost for the work RTD is doing as part of this IGA.  Henry Stopplecamp explained that the work Director Folska is referencing was approved last year; the construction project is approximately $2.5 million while the buses will cost an additional $8.4.  Director Folska wondered if RTD was able to get a grant to purchase the buses.  Bill Van Meter said RTD received a grant from the State to help fund a portion of the bus purchase.

Director Menten asked why the IGA has a retroactive effective date.  Henry Stopplecamp explained that construction for the Free MetroRide began in late October or November in order for RTD to be ready to begin service when DUS opens in May.

Director Walker noted that the first two years of the IGA are set at 10K.  He wonders what happens if snow removal, maintenance, etc. costs come in lower.  Henry Stopplecamp said that RTD would not be reimbursed; however, the contract allows for prices to be adjusted after the first two years.  He said that RTD also has the opportunity to bring the services back in-house if the costs get to be too expensive.

Committee Chair Hoy declared the motion PASSED.

#### 1. Update on the Southeast Extension Environmental Assessment

Susan Wood, Planning Project Manager, and Andy Mutz, Engineering Project Manager, reviewed a Power Point presentation with the Board that is available in the February 4, 2014 FasTracks Monitoring Committee Agenda Packet.

Director Menten asked how many people attended the December 2013 public meeting.  She also wondered how RTD was advertising the meeting in March.  Susan Wood stated that the meeting was not well attended as only about 5 to 10 people came.  She said it was a very snowy night so they recognize that could affect attendance.  She noted that if staff had heard from people that they wanted to attend but could not make it they would have scheduled another meeting.  Susan Wood said that for the March meeting, a notice would be sent to a list of interested stakeholders as well as in various newspapers, on RTD’s website and on certain stakeholder websites.

Director Menten wondered if any of the proposed alignment would be located in Unincorporated Douglas County.  Susan Wood stated that all of the alignment is within the City of Lone Tree.   Director Menten noted that Lone Tree has a typical Channel 8 public television.  She asked if they were utilizing this channel.  Susan Wood said staff would look into that.

Director Menten commented that the chart on page 12 did not show any impact on public safety.  She wondered where the notice would go out if we do have a safety issue, say an at-grade crossing.  Susan Wood stated that there was no impact on public safety.  She said there is one at-grade crossing and RTD will need to work with the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) because safety is important.

Director Lubow said it was her understanding that surface parking was less expensive than structured parking.  She noted, however, that she is getting the impression that structured parking was less expensive in this case.  She asked if that was accurate.  Andy Mutz stated that she was correct and it really defies logic.  He explained that there are three reasons in this scenario that make structured parking as affordable as surface: (1) the expansive soils and the requirement for RTD to over excavate and replace with adequate soils; (2) the slope of the site requires a lot of walls for surface parking and (3) there is not a significant cost increase for the few extra acres needed for structured parking.  He stated that this case is just not typical because of the site conditions but under normal circumstances surface parking is much more affordable.

Director Deadwyler said it was her understanding that a decision had not been made as to what extension to complete next; however, she wonders, based on the precise details of this presentation, if it has been decided to begin this extension first.  General Manager Washington stated that no decision has been made but RTD does have a Full Funding Grant Agreement (FFGA) application out for this extension.  He noted that there has been a lot of activity in this part of the region to bring some funding to the table.  If there is an ask for funding from RTD, that would be brought to the Board.  He stressed that RTD does not want to forfeit an FFGA.

Chair Sisk stated that while he understands this extension might not be popular in some areas he fully supports it.

Director Daly asked where the at-grade crossing was located as he could not find it on the map.  Susan Wood said it would be near the SkyRidge Station.  Any Mutz explained that the road was just built so that may be why it is not on the map.

Director Deadwyler asked if the FFGA funds could be used for another area.  General Manager Washington explained that RTD specifically applied for the FFGA for the Southeast extension because it met federal criteria for the grant.

General Manager Washington stated that staff plans to present to the Board the criteria for FFGAs, information on MAP21, etc. at the end of February so the Board knows what to ask for during the APTA Legislative Conference and understands why RTD can seek funding in some corridors and not others.

Director Lasater informed the Board that he has had several meetings with Lone Tree in which they have assured him that they will have the local matching funds available.  He said that Terry Howerter is working with Lone Tree to make sure everything is laid out to demonstrate to the Federal Government that we have the matching funds for an FFGA.

Director Bagley shared that he too attended the public meeting in December.  He said that the people in attendance were really interested in gaining more information.  Director Bagley also stated that in looking at the one at-grade crossing, this is really nothing compared to I-225 and Downtown.  He also believes when this extension is done it will be as built-up as the stations in Aurora.

Director Folska noted that the location of the at-grade crossing is not a heavily trafficked area.

Committee Chair Hoy agrees with staff that it would be valuable for the Board to have a general overview of how a corridor or line qualifies for various grants.

Director Lubow asked that the Board also be provided with information as to how acceptability of a line for private funding is determined.

##### a. SE_RTD Board update _2-4-14 v 3

#### 2. Eagle P3 Project Update

Kevin Flynn, Public Information, Brian Middleton, FasTracks Program Management Consultant, and Greg Straight, Project Manager of Engineering and Facilities, reviewed a Power Point presentation with the Board that is available in the February 4, 2014 FasTracks Monitoring Committee Agenda Packet.

Director Daly asked why four bridges needed to be re-designed.  He asked if the bridges needed to be strengthened.  Greg Straight said that the bridges did not necessarily need to be strengthened.  Some just needed reinforcement while one did need strengthening.

Director Bagley congratulated DTP and RTD staff for working on this significant project with over $1 billion in FFGA funding.  He said that he remembers when this project was just a dream but to see it effectively halfway done is absolutely fantastic.  He believes everyone involved is doing a great job.

Director Anderson thanked the team for their good work.  She said this is a project she has had very little heartburn over.  She shared that she has not had one citizen complaint which is very admirable.  Director Anderson asked staff for a discussion about how the Gold Line might be affecting traffic along Grandview offline.

Director Folska stated that the progress is a testament to the effort of the team.  She said this is more than a significant project; it is a national model.  She believes it is easy for the Board to take it for granted because it is all they know but when she is traveling everyone is talking about this project.  She said it is really fantastic to hear.  Director Folska asked how many private financing companies were working on this project.  Greg Amparano, DTP Executive Project Director, said that Lloyds Banking Group, John Laing and Fluor were all involved in the private equity.  He commented that the total subcontractors are in the thousands so he would not be able to list them all.

Director Tobiassen thanked the DTP outreach team for their efforts in Aurora along with the RTD PI team.  He said that they are really willing to show up for everything everywhere.  He appreciates their hard work in responding to any issues.  Director Tobiassen asked when the bus tours would be available again.  Kevin Flynn said the plan was for the tours to resume in April and staff would begin promoting them in March.  He shared that the tours were subscribed to very quickly last year and they expect that will only intensify this year.

Director Deadwyler also thanked the team for their hard work.  She thinks they are doing a fantastic job.  She shared that her constituents are beginning to forgive her for all the construction because they can see that RTD is really making progress.  Director Deadwyler did express concern that it seems we are closing up more at one time than we did in the past and it does make travel difficult in the area.  Greg Straight said that this is the year in which we will be finishing up the part that impacts the community as it relates to detours.  Once construction of the bridges, track, etc. is complete and the project is to a point where staff is working on systems design and testing, the impacts to the community will dramatically decline.

Committee Chair Hoy thanked everyone for the job they are doing.  He believes this is quite an accomplishment and the team is doing a stellar job.  He stated that it helps all of the Board members when RTD is getting a project this big done.
