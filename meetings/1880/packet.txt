Board Meeting Date: February 4, 2014

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors appoint one
member to the FasTracks Citizens Advisory Committee of the Regional Transportation District (RTD) to
fill a vacancy on the Committee.
BACKGROUND
The seventeen-member FasTracks Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) advises the District on matters
relating to the implementation of the voter approved FasTracks program, and performs such additional
duties as requested by RTD. The Committee serves in an advisory capacity through the designated
liaison to the Board of Directors, staff and project consultants
Committee member Steve Lawrence submitted his resignation from the CAC effective February 19,
2014, due to his pending deployment with the Peace Corps.
Recruitment for citizens interested in serving on the CAC was publicly advertised through the RTD Web
site, a news release sent to stakeholders, local publications and electronic broadcast media lists totaling
1,541 recipients, current CAC members for distribution to their networks, and through other distribution
channels. Applicants were asked to submit a one-page letter stating their interest in serving on the CAC
along with specific qualifications, highlights of related experience and expertise and a resume if
available. Forty applications were received by the deadline.
The Nominating Committee, composed of two Board members and two Assistant General Managers,
carefully reviewed each application received in order to fill vacant positions at the end of 2013, and to
identify alternates should a vacancy occur during 2014, considering criteria outlined in the Committee
Structure adopted by the Board in 2005, including:






Broad representation of stakeholder interests
Diversity
Demonstrated interest in public transit and/or the FasTracks program
Previous community service
Professional experience.

The following applicant was identified as the first alternate and is recommended for appointment to fill
the remaining portion of Mr. Lawrence’s term expiring on December 31, 2014:
Hannah Polow is a Transportation Planner at Boulder County Transportation. She has worked on projects
such as bike storage along the BOLT route on the Diagonal Highway; encouraging secondary school
students to travel to school in a sustainable manner; the county's transportation master plan; working
with architects to create a successful transportation plan at a human services building; and responding

Packet Pg. 4

1.C.1

to bicycle issues related to the September 2013 flood. Her personal attention to transportation issues
started as a college student at CU-Boulder—especially how to combine transit with other modes. She
got her Bachelor's from CU-Boulder and holds a Master's in Urban and Regional Planning from UCLA.
She works all over Boulder County and is a resident of Boulder, RTD District O.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no additional financial impact.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee
that the RTD Board of Directors appoint one new member to the FasTracks Citizens Advisory
Committee of the Regional Transportation District (RTD) to fill a vacancy on the Committee.
2. Modify the recommended appointments to the FasTracks Citizens Advisory Committee. This is
not recommended as the identification of an alternate followed an extensive public application
process and is within the parameters of the Committee Structure adopted by the RTD Board of
Directors.
3. Do not adopt the Recommended Action. This is not recommended as this alternative would delay
the appointment process of the FasTracks Citizens Advisory Committee.

Date:

Board Meeting Date: February 4, 2014

Subject:

Authorization for Intergovernmental Agreement
(IGA) with the City and County of Denver
(CCD) for the Free MetroRide

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager, or designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into an
Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with the City and County of Denver (CCD), for the maintenance of
roadway and street furniture improvements constructed for the operation of the Free MetroRide,
formerly known as the Downtown Denver Circulator (Circulator).
BACKGROUND
The Free MetroRide will be a high-frequency bus service that will transport passengers between Denver
Union Station and the Civic Center area. The Monday to Friday, peak rush hours (6-9 a.m. and 3-6
p.m.) headway will be 5 minutes. There are no current plans to provide weekend, mid-day or evening
service, however, this could change depending on ridership and funding availability. Service from
Denver Union Station will travel southeast on 19th Street, turn south onto Broadway and then east onto
16th Avenue at Civic Center. From Civic Center, the route continues east on 16th Avenue, north onto
Lincoln Street, and then northwest onto 18th Street to Denver Union Station. The Free MetroRide will
supplement RTD’s Free Mall Ride, which runs on the 16th Street Mall, and like the Mall shuttle, will be
free and uniquely branded.
DISCUSSION
RTD designed, funded, and is currently constructing 13 uniquely branded Free MetroRide bus stops.
Nine bus stops will be street-side, and four will be at bus islands that will extend beyond existing streetside curbs. Each Free MetroRide stop will have a concrete bus stopping pad, custom route markers and
nine stops will have canopies. The bus islands will also have custom seating bollards and planters. 18 th
Street is a City designated bicycle route. The bicycle lanes, as needed, will be located between the bus
island and existing street-side curbs. The customized elements at the Free MetroRide stops and the
bicycle lanes require a repair and maintenance IGA with CCD that clarifies responsibilities.
The IGA includes the following provisions for constructing and maintaining transit improvements within
CCD’s right-of-way. If approved, it becomes retroactively effective on November 1, 2013. Key
provisions of the IGA include the following:
1. RTD to maintain and repair four bus islands, all shelter canopies, street furnishings at all stops, and
the bicycle lane concrete and pavement markings located between the bus islands and street-side
curbs.
2. Annual payments of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) to CCD for maintenance, snow removal, and
cleaning of bicycle lane segments located at the bus islands.
3. RTD shall repair the bicycle lanes, as needed for the four segments located at bus islands, and shall

Packet Pg. 6

1.C.2

also maintain the bicycle lane pavement markings in those same locations.
4. Major encumbrance permits and fees will be waived by CCD.
5. Any construction moratorium on 19th Street and 16th Avenue will be eliminated by CCD.
6. CCD agrees not to charge RTD for the parking meters.
7. The IGA also addresses provisions for its possible termination and future cost shares.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
1. RTD shall provide an annual amount of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) to CCD for the
maintenance, snow removal, and cleaning of bicycle lane segments located at the bus islands,
commencing in 2014.
2. If CCD’s necessary and reasonable annual expenses for maintenance are greater or less than an
average of Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00) for 2014 and 2015, RTD’s annual payment shall be
adjusted accordingly. Invoices shall be provided by CCD to RTD by April 1, 2016. For each
subsequent two-year period thereafter, while this IGA is in effect, RTD’s annual payment shall be
increased or decreased accordingly to actual costs. RTD’s annual payments shall be due on July 1 of
each year.
3. Roadway and street furniture construction costs were included in a separate on-call FasTracks
contract for the current amount of $2.4M, which includes a 35% DBE goal. In addition, 12 buses
were purchased for this project at a cost of $8,389,343.00.
4. Approximately 15 construction employees are being utilized for the work.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or designee, to execute all documents
necessary to enter into an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with the City and County of Denver
(CCD), for the maintenance of roadway and street furniture improvements constructed for the
operation of the Free MetroRide, formerly known as the Downtown Denver Circulator (Circulator).
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action and do not enter into an IGA. This would impact the
operation of the Free MetroRide , causing inconvenience to the public. The stop improvements are
currently under construction. The Free MetroRide is a component of the FasTracks plan, and is
needed to support the Free MetroRide service that has been established.
3. Delay implementing the Recommended Action. This is not recommended because it would cause
inconvenience to the public. Market Street Station bus operations will move to DUS on May 11,
2014. Moving passengers between DUS and Civic Center provides a significant downtown
connection, which is crucial for RTD’s operations and its patrons.
