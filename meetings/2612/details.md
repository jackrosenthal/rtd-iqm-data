### B. Introduction of Thor, RTD K-9 Officer (No Backup)

Committee Chair Anderson said that the Board had a special treat tonight as Thor, RTD’s newest K-9 transit police officer, would be introduced.

Bruce Abel, Acting Chief Operations Officer/Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, said asked Chief Bob Grado, Sergeant Amy Homyak and Thor, the wonder dog, to come forward to be introduced.

Bob Grado, Transit Police Chief, said that Thor, RTD’s newest member of the transit police force, is with us tonight.  He stated RTD was able to adopt Thor through a grant from the Department of Homeland Security and that Sergeant Homyak and Thor had just completed twelve weeks of training together.

Committee Chair Anderson said that Thor was one of the cuddliest police officers that RTD has ever had.

Director Walker inquired about Thor’s specialties and asked what he had been trained to do.

Sergeant Homyak said that Thor was a detection dog, and he spends a great deal of his time at Union Station.  She added that she and Thor also devote as much time as they can throughout the district.

Committee Chair Anderson said that she was excited and looks forward to seeing Thor around the district.

#### 1. Enter into a Contract with RouteMatch for MDT and On-Board Software for Access-a-Ride

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to award a contract for computerized Mobile Data Terminals (MDTs) and onboard software with RouteMatch Software, Inc. (RouteMatch) (Contract Number 17DH025) for an amount not to exceed $1,800,000.  The price includes MDTs, software, implementation and three years of extended support.

BACKGROUND

RTD’s Access-a-Ride paratransit service provides transportation in the Denver metro area for people whose disabilities prevent them from using lift-equipped fixed-route bus service. Access-a-Ride service uses vehicles equipped with RouteMatch software and iPilot 8000 computerized Mobile Data Terminals (MDTs) and associated onboard equipment that enables dispatching and communications via the RouteMatch paratransit scheduling and central dispatch software (‘RouteMatch central software’). The current MDTs entered service in 2009 and reached end of useful life several years ago. The current MDT’s have very high failure rates and are hard to procure. Consequently, it is imperative that the MDTs be replaced with modern equipment in order to provide Access-a-Ride drivers with the necessary tools to provide this important service.

DISCUSSION

RTD currently utilizes paratransit scheduling software produced by “RouteMatch.” It is necessary that the on-board software loaded on the MDT’s integrate with the backend RouteMatch software in order to allow Access-a-ride drivers to receive accurate information to perform their duties.  Onboard software that integrates with the RouteMatch central software is already developed.

RTD conducted an evaluation of the various options to replace the existing Access-a-Ride Mobile Data Terminals. The option with the quickest deployment, least risk and lowest cost is to have RouteMatch deploy new modern versions of the computerized MDTs with onboard software. Requiring RouteMatch to provide the updated hardware and software, perform the integration and thus provide the complete solution to modernize the Access-a-Ride MDT’s will speed the process by providing fewer procurements and result in a single point of contact for RTD to have one vendor responsible for all of the functionality associated with the upgrade of the Access-a-Ride MDT’s.

FINANCIAL IMPACT

Funding for this project is included in the adopted RTD budget.

ALTERNATIVES

1.  Authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute a contract with RouteMatch to provide computerized MDTs and onboard software.  This is the recommended alternative.

2.  Continue to try to provide remedial repairs to extend the system life.  This is not a sustainable option and does not provide the upgrades necessary for Access-a-Ride drivers to perform their duties. This is not recommended.

3.  Proceed with an entirely new procurement for a new paratransit scheduling software package and integrated MDT’s.  This would take well over a year to procure and deploy the chosen system and is not budgeted. This is not recommended.

Prepared by:  Eric Farrington

Motion:               Director Tisdale made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the July 25, 2017 Board Meeting.

Director Williams seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Mr. Abel said that in 2008 RTD went live with the RouteMatch software and in 2009 went live with the Mobile Data Terminals (MDTs).  He stated that the current MDTs have reached the end of their useful life and staff is unable to make upgrades to the devices.  He stated that staff is working with RouteMatch to make necessary updates as needed, but the current devices have high failure rates and are difficult to procure.  He explained that it was imperative that the MDTs be replaced so that staff can have an up-to-date solution to react to real time changes, and staff appreciated the committee referring this action item to the full Board for approval.

Director Menten noted that the current MDTs were purchased in 2009 and the end of useful life was reached years ago.  She asked what guarantees RTD has to ensure the new devices will last longer than three years and inquired if there was a warranty.

Eric Farrington, Senior Project Manager, explained that RTD got a good five to six years out of the original devices.  He said that the current MDTs are requiring additional service and there are no replacements available.  He noted that the new devices chosen by staff are a second generation of the original devices currently in use, and the extended support will cover the devices for three years.

Director Lubow commented that this was a sole source contract.  She asked what criteria was met in order to have this as a sole source, and asked that Board Reports include the supplementary information for sole source criteria.

Mr. Farrington explained that RouteMatch software handles scheduling and manifests for the agency.  He said the software on other vehicles must match the software on buses, and this contract accomplishes that requirement.

Mr. Abel remarked that in 2008 RTD used Trapeze software.  He stated that it is desirable to have an integrated system, and if there are two separate vendors, there will always be a disconnect between the two programs.  He noted that RTD’s strategy is to have a single point of software to make sure that it works.

Director Solano stated that this was great, and if it made the system work better, he would support this 100 percent.

Director Deadwyler asked if this software would improve the GPS on buses.

Mr. Farrington stated that the software will include GPS on the buses.  He added that there will be an external antenna added to improve the signal, and it will use live maps to ensure they are always up to date.

Committee Chair Anderson remarked that this was fantastic and will allow RTD to be much more efficient and to meet ADA passengers needs easier and quicker.

Director Deadwyler commented that she would be voting in favor of this item.

Committee Chair Anderson declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

#### 2. Enter into a Contract with INIT for Automatic Passenger Counters for Light Rail Vehicles

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to award a contract for purchase, installation and maintenance of Automatic Passenger Counters (APCs) with INIT Innovations in Transportation, Inc. (INIT) (Contract Number 17DH026) for an amount not to exceed $2,400,000 and transfer up to $950,000 from project 10444 (Mobile Data Terminals) to project 10345 (New Automatic Passenger Counter).

BACKGROUND

RTD uses APC’s on light rail vehicles to monitor on-time performance and to gather ridership information. The data collected by the APCs is ingested into the INIT Computer Aided Dispatch/ Automatic Vehicle Location (CAD/AVL) system for compilation, presentation, and analysis of ridership numbers and on-time performance calculations. This data is key for required federal reporting, operational considerations and planning.  Currently, only 42 of the 201 vehicle LRV fleet (24%) are equipped with APC’s making it very difficult to provide statistically valid information.

DISCUSSION

RTD recently purchased hardware for the Access-a-Ride Mobile Data Terminal (MDT) Replacement project.  Staff subsequently determined that the equipment could be better utilized on the LRV fleet to expand the number of APC equipped light rail cars to help with passenger count and on-time performance measurement. A less expensive alternative for the Access-a-Ride MDT Replacement Project has been identified and pursued, freeing up some funds that can be transferred to purchase additional APCs for light rail.

RTD currently has an authorized and budgeted project (Project 10345 -New Auto Passenger Counters) to begin to upgrade and expand the number of APC’s on the LRV fleet.  Utilizing some of the hardware that had already been purchased for the Access-a-Ride MDT project and transferring the remaining funds from the MDT project will allow RTD to expand the scope of the currently budgeted LRV APC project and further increase the number of Light Rail Vehicles that can be equipped with new APC equipment. By using some of this equipment and transferring these additional funds, the APC coverage on the LRV fleet can be increased to over 70%.  This will allow for easier and more timely compilation of statistically valid data for monitoring on-time performance and for gathering ridership data for internal and external reporting. This equipment will be upgraded for both reliability and for security of data transmissions over Wi-Fi.  This will be a sole source contract to INIT in order to expand the number of APC equipped light rail vehicles with technology similar to and compatible with the technology that is utilized on the existing LRV fleet.

FINANCIAL IMPACT

Funding for this project (Project 10345- New Automatic Passenger Counters) is included in the adopted RTD budget. The transfer of up to $950,000 from project 10444- Mobile Data Terminals, also included in the adopted RTD budget, to project 10345 will fund the requested expansion of this effort.

ALTERNATIVES

1.  Authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to award a contract for purchase, installation and maintenance of Automatic Passenger Counters (APCs) with INIT Innovations in Transportation, Inc. (INIT) (Contract Number 17DH026) for an amount not to exceed $2,400,000 and transfer up to $950,000 from project 10444 (Mobile Data Terminals) to project 10345 (New Automatic Passenger Counter).  This is the recommended alternative.

2.  Continue to try to utilize existing resources and provide minimal expansion and upgrade to the existing APC’s. This does not leverage the existing hardware purchase and minimizes improvements in data collection and service monitoring and is not the recommended alternative.

Motion:               Director Tisdale made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the July 25, 2017 Board Meeting.

Director Solano seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Mr. Abel stated that in some respects, this action is a partner to the previous item.  He commented that currently, RTD uses Automatic Passenger Counters (APCs) to monitor passenger boardings as well as on-time performance.  He said that the goal was to use the same APCs that are used on the fixed route system, and it was determined that it would be more beneficial and cost efficient to have RouteMatch update the APCs.  He noted that currently, only 42 light rail vehicles, or 24%, had passenger counters and that presented quite a challenge in providing correct passenger totals.  He explained that with approval of this item, staff will be able to acquire and supplement an APC project that is already on the books to improve passenger counting and on-time performance of light rail.  He further added that staff wants to enter a sole source contract so that it is identical to existing bus and rail light counters.

Director Broom asked if this device can distinguish between someone getting on or off a vehicle.

Mr. Farrington said yes.

Director Broom asked if on-time performance was scaled to the number of passengers per vehicle.

Mr. Abel commented that RTD measures on-time performance by vehicle on-time performance only.

Director Francone remarked that the Board just approved $1.8 million for the MDTs.  She asked if there were left over funds that were applied to this contract.

Mr. Abel said yes, there were funds left over from the original contract.

Director Francone inquired how staff accurately calculates on-time performance for light rail since only a small percentage of light rail vehicles have passenger counters.

Mr. Abel explained that there is a lot of math involved.  He remarked that information is communicated from service and planning to light rail and collected to form a sample for on-time performance.

Director Francone stated that it was an incredible amount of work, and this purchase will improve that process.

Chair Hoy asked if the new devices would be more accurate, and if so, would that make performance numbers increase or decrease.

Mr. Abel stated that the new devices would allow staff to measure on-time performance more accurately.  He noted that staff expects a change as they will have a more accurate picture, but he could not say if it would go up or down.

Director Solano asked if staff would be able to compare revenue per train with the new devices.

Mr. Abel commented that this hardware itself will do not do that, as revenue comes in at the Ticket Vending Machines (TVMs), but he said that staff would have a better understanding of the ridership of each line.

Director Lubow inquired if every vehicle at RTD would be equipped with this technology.

Mr. Abel stated that it is a desirable goal, but it will take time.

Director Tisdale asked if the $2.4 million for the project budget will be offset by other funds.

Mr. Farrington noted that the total budget will not exceed $2.4 million.  He noted that there are different sources of funds, and some will be used to maintain the equipment over time.

Director Deadwyler inquired if this software could be used to measure and compare boardings with the fares that are collected.

Mr. Abel said that better passenger count information would provide the finance department with better information to allocate funds to the various lines.

Director Deadwyler asked if RTD could count boardings to see that everyone on board had paid.

Mr. Abel stated that fare checks are performed through fare inspections in Chief Grado’s group.  He noted that over the years, RTD has developed a more robust fare inspection system as part of the smart card project.

Director Deadwyler commented that she would be voting in favor of this item.

Director Walker added that this technology is not new to RTD, it is just more of what is already out there.

Mr. Abel remarked that Director Walker was correct, and said that this is an expansion of a current project.

Committee Chair Anderson declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

#### 1. 16th Street Mall Update (No Backup)

Mr. Abel stated that Jessie Carter and Susan Wood would assist with this update.

Susan Wood, Planning Project Manager, stated that it is staffs goal to provide the Board with periodic updates about the 16th street mall.  She said that the project kicked off on May 2nd, and the first of three workshops have been held.  She noted that General Manager Genova was at the kick-off meeting and his opening remarks were well received.  She stated that the first workshop was a broad study that included the history of the mall and tours of the mall.  She noted that staff’s goal at this time is to be able to utilize grant money that is being held until the project details are finalized.  She remarked that the next workshop will be September 6th – 8th, 2017 and will focus on options and preferred alternatives and the third workshop will delve into the preferred alternatives.  She added that the goal is to finish the environmental assessment by the end of 2017.  She further noted that upcoming public outreach events are scheduled for July 22nd, 2017, from 12:00-4:00 p.m. during the Denver Meet in the Street event, and on July 27th, 2017, RTD will host a public open house at 12:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m. in order to get additional public feedback.

Jessie Carter, Service Planning and Scheduling Manager, commented that this process has a lot of different viewpoints to sort through and communicate to the public.

Mr. Abel explained that the purpose of the first workshop was to determine what common elements existed.  He said that the second workshop will focus on the common elements as it is important to collectively understand the agreed upon guiding principles, such as the 16th Street MallRide staying on 16th Street.

Director Menten asked if it will be clear at the open house on the 27th that maintenance costs are extreme and part of the mall is unsafe.

Ms. Wood said that the purpose being articulated concerns the very specific maintenance that has to be performed.

Mr. Abel said that including maintenance costs in the purpose and needs statement is an excellent recognition of what is important.

General Manager Genova commented that maintenance costs are a point he makes every time he discusses the mall as granite pavers are not a material that would be installed in contemporary designs.  He added that he met with the Denver Post and thought the conversation was very informative.

Director Francone said that she did not want granite pavers included in the updated design and wanted to make sure that RTD only pays for the roadway as that is what RTD is contractually obligated to do.  She added that there are a lot of pretty designs out there, but there are no costs attributed to them.  She further stated that if there is a cost consideration with those designs, the public should know what it will cost, as well as the maintenance costs.

Director Broom asked if this process examines the current public use of the mall, and if it would also estimate its future use.

Mr. Abel said yes.  He noted that part of the conversation staff has had concerns the critical role the mall plays in RTD’s network.  He stated that utilization will continue, and mall shuttle services will be expanded.  He added that as rail services grow, staff will need to adjust service in order to carry the expected number of people projected to use the mall.

Chair Hoy remarked that the Board will not approve the use of expensive pavers in the future.  He added that earlier in the day, he observed a heavy garbage truck travel down 16th Street and said that RTD should not pay to repair roadways that heavy garbage trucks are using.

#### 2. November 2017 Service Change

Mr. Abel said that staff is anticipating that the Civic Center Station will be completed by the first of November.  He stated that staff is evaluating the need to do a run-board change because RTD’s scheduling systems contain all of the downstream public information systems.  He added that staff will need to change all of the internal systems to address the re-opening of Civic Center Station and are hopeful that they can do it with a simple back-end IT change without having a new run-board.

#### 3. Lost Service Hours Update 7 18 17

Mr. Abel stated that the lost service hours update was included in the Operations & Customer Service Committee packet.  He said that in the month of June, 203 hours were lost compared to 117 hours from June of 2016.  He noted that year to date, 1,400 hours have been lost compared to 2,400 last year.  He remarked that RTD is still showing improvement, but the downside is that staff is still having to mandate operators.  He commented that RTD is 130 operators shy, but there has been improvement from the customer perspective, and staff can demonstrate improvement efforts.

Committee Chair Anderson asked staff to thank all of the operators who are mandated and working so many overtime hours.

Mr. Abel added that staff would communicate the thanks and appreciation from the Board for all of the operators who are working extra hours to maintain service.

##### a. Lost Service Hours Update 7 18 17

### E. Other Matters

There were no other matters.

### G. Adjourn

Committee Chair Anderson adjourned the meeting at 6:26 p.m.
