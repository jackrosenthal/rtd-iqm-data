Director Williams asked if the General Manager had given the information in the State of the District address to the press during a recent tour.

General Manager Genova said that he had not and had focused on the reopening of Civic Center Station but noted that he would make his information widely available.

Director Williams said she did not see where the presentation showed what happened when the agency experienced dropped routes.

General Manager Genova referred Director Williams to a slide that showed, despite dropped routes, the agency provided 99.5% of bus services and 99.9% of rail services.

Director Williams said the agency should tout those figures more often.

Director Anderson congratulated the General Manager and staff and said she was always proud to be associated with RTD. She noted the restructured bus service network as a result of the opening of the G Line. She also congratulated staff on recent refinancing efforts, which would save the agency $192 million.

Director Lubow said she was surprised to see that RTD’s starting salary was lower than average and asked whether companies with higher starting salaries experienced fewer problems.

General Manager Genova said that things other than salary came into play in regards to employee retention. He said that staff had not gathered information on recruiting from the Employers Council but said that RTD was unique because of its split shifts and report times. He said the agency had successfully reduced split shifts through schedule changes.

Bruce Abel, Acting Chief Operating Officer and Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, said that the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) required 55% straight shifts and that, as of the January 2017 run board, the agency was at 57%. He noted that operators were offered monetary incentives to operate split shifts and that, as a result, the agency itself was incentivized to reduce the number of split shifts.

General Manager Genova said that the agency was also trying to reduce the duration of split shifts and noted that RTD realized the importance of wages and wanted to be market-competitive for wages, benefits, and quality of life considerations.

Director Lubow said she was intrigued by the fact that there were bus organizations that did not share RTD’s problems.

General Manager Genova noted that those organizations were not transit agencies and that RTD was in the middle of the pack nationally.

Mr. Abel noted that school systems were scrambling for bus operators in Denver and that, across the industry, drivers and maintainers were in demand.

Director Lubow said that she did not see RTD attempting to increase the proportion of people in the district who used transit as opposed to personal vehicles. She stated that increasing that proportion would keep the agency relevant and would urge to such an initiative be included in future planning.

Director Tisdale said General Manager Genova had given a presentation of the good, the bad, and the ugly and noted there were ugly elements the agency had to face. Regarding the Workplace Initiative Now (WIN) program, he said the driver shortage issue kept coming up and that he had confidence in the community college system to work with RTD to create a workforce pipeline.

Director Archuleta asked the General Manager to explain the problems with the N Line.

General Manager Genova invited Henry Stopplecamp, Assistant General Manager of Capital Programs, to respond.

Mr. Stopplecamp said that the issue was contractual and not financial and had to do with coordination between the contractor and third parties, including Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF), the Stock Show, and the City of Thornton. He said the parties were communicating, sharing plans, and moving forward. He said the line was scheduled to be turned over to RTD in 2019.

Director Archuleta asked whether the agency had devised a way to rescue stranded passengers from the Skyway bridge.

Mr. Stopplecamp said there were stairs to the ground on the bridge itself and noted that the agency worked with nearby property owners to secure emergency services pathways. He said the agency’s preferred method would be to use a rescue train to pull a stranded train off the bridge in the event of a power outage.

Director Archuleta asked when the line would open.

Mr. Stopplecamp said that the line would be handed over in 2019 and that the agency would work as quickly as possible to get it open.

Chair Hoy noted that the Colorado chapter of the American Public Works Association Colorado had awarded Westminster Station the Project of the Year, which he said was a big accolade.

General Manager Genova said he had seen mention of the award but did not have more information.

Chair Hoy stated that he was very pleased with the cost, quick rollout, and operation of the mobile ticketing application and said that people were happy with it.

Director Folska agreed. She noted that the Art-n-Transit program had been featured on a public television program and asked whether a link to the program was posted on the RTD website.

Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager of Communications, said the link was posted and that the agency had sent out social media reminders.

Director Folska thanked staff for their ongoing efforts to hire persons with disabilities, particularly in the Customer Care center. She said she had received positive feedback from people saying they were pleased they were being hired. Regarding the International Train Roadeo in June 2018, she asked whether the agency planned to meet with representatives from Japanese rail agencies. She noted that the Shinkansen bullet train had not experienced an accident in over 50 years of operation.

General Manager Genova noted that rail agencies in southeast Asia had developed proficiencies in operations and safety and noted that the American Public Transportation Association (APTA) had sent a number of missions to the region to learn about their operations.

Mike Meader, Chief Safety Officer and Assistant General Manager of Safety, Security, and Asset Management, agreed that transit agencies in the region were leaders and that many of their safety procedures had been adopted all over the world. He noted that APTA was in the process of adopting the practice of pointing and calling, where operators point to and call out the color of signs, speed limits, etc.

Director Broom noted that Japanese railroads did not have grade crossings, which helped to increase safety. He noted that bus ridership was down and asked whether the decline was leveling off or increasing and what the agency should do to rectify the problem.

General Manager Genova noted that the decline in ridership was a national trend in the industry. He noted that some agencies were down significantly but said that the impact to RTD was low or moderate in comparison. He said that the decline in ridership was one of five areas the new APTA chair was reviewing. He stated that people had choices due to low gasoline prices and a good economy and chose not to ride buses. He said that transportation network companies (TNCs) contributed to the ridership decline but said the agency could not tell how much market share RTD had lost to them.

Heather McKillop, Chief Financial Officer and Assistant General Manager of Finance and Administration, said that the agency had seen movement of passengers from bus to rail, which was accounted for in planning.

General Manager Genova said that the industry nationwide had witnessed a decline in bus ridership to other modes of transportation.

Director Solano said that the agency was not talking about transit-oriented development (TOD).

General Manager Genova said that the agency was still very much involved with TOD and had recently presented information on plans to analyze potential TOD projects going forward.

Director Menten said that TNCs do affect RTD but also fill a need and offer quick, inexpensive service.

Ms. McKillop introduced Andrew Gale, the new Senior Manager of Human Resources.

#### 1. 2017 State of the District

#### 1. 2017-010 : 2018 Audit Charter

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors approves the attached 2018 Audit Charter.

Motion:               Director Anderson made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the December 19th, 2017 Board Meeting.

Director Tisdale seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Ann Marie Isaac-Heslop, Internal Audit Manager, said that the audit charter formalized the purpose, authority, and responsibility of the agency’s auditors. She said that the professional body that governs auditors typically updated only portions of audit best practices guidelines each year. She said that this year the body had sent out a fully updated and standardized guide, which she said she was happy with.

Director Folska said she would support the motion.

Director Menten asked whether the agency would need to approve the charter on an annual basis.

Ms. Isaac-Heslop said that the auditors typically updated the charter annually and that any changes to the audit standards would require Board approval.

Committee Chair Menten declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

##### a. 2018 Audit Charter Proposed final

#### 2. 2017-011 : Annual Audit Plan 2018

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors approves the attached Annual Audit Plan for 2018.

Motion:               Director Broom made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the December 19th, 2017 Board Meeting.

Director Anderson seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Ms. Isaac-Heslop said that audit had received few contributions to the audit list from outside of the auditors’ office in 2017. She said that in previous years the Board, the Senior Leadership Team (SLT), and others had contributed. She noted that additional funding would allow the number of audits to increase and that the auditors would be reviewing purchasing cards, spending, payroll, lobbying contracts, performance measures, travel training, entertainment expenses, workers’ compensation, IT controls and assets, cybersecurity, and disaster recovery.

Director Broom said that 40% of audit hours came from contract audit hours from outside the agency. He asked how many hours would be spent managing the outside auditor and whether the audits assigned to the outside auditor would be simple.

Ms. Isaac-Heslop said that having the outside auditor would allow her to have more time to manage internal auditing. She said that there was more audit work than the auditors could perform and that having the outside auditor meant that she could manage the work the auditors were doing. She noted that she would be able to use the outside auditor for specific tasks, such as IT audits, which would give the internal auditors more time to look at things like the purchasing card audit.

Director Menten asked about the progress of the Access-a-Ride and Call-n-Ride audits.

Ms. Isaac-Heslop said that the planning was completed and that the field work had begun. She said the auditors were doing an analysis of vehicles and the number of passengers per vehicle. She said that there was still a lot of work to do but that it was going well.

Regarding the outside auditor, Director Menten asked whether the person would be an experienced auditor or an intern.

Ms. Isaac-Heslop said that she had one intern currently and expected another to begin in January 2018, with each working 20 hours per week. She said the other auditors added value but also needed managing.

Committee Chair Menten declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

##### a. 2018 Audit Plan Proposed Final

#### 3. 2017-012 : Budget Transfer for Planning Grant Projects

It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors approve a budget transfer of $4.664 million from the Operating Reserve to the Planning base system expense grant project budget, effective January 1, 2018, to allow for the completion of grant-funded projects that will not be completed in 2017.  The Operating Reserve will be replenished in the 2018 Amended Budget with the funds that were not spent on these projects in 2017.

Motion:               Director Anderson made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the December 19th, 2017 Board Meeting.

Director Williams seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Ms. McKillop said that several carryforward projects were missed during the preparation of the budget. She noted the projects would not be completed in 2017 and that funds were available for the projects.

Director Folska asked Ms. McKillop to describe the projects that were overlooked.

Ms. McKillop said that six of projects were related to money from the STAMP program, under which RTD passed funds to local entities, and the others were for the BRT 119 and BRT system study.

Director Folska stated those programs had already been approved.

Ms. McKillop said yes and noted that these programs would have been caught if the budgeting procedure had been done properly.

Committee Chair Menten declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

#### 4. 2017-019 : Update to 2018 Quarterly Performance Measures

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors adopt updated 2018 Quarterly Performance Measures to include measures for ridership, fare revenue, and total operating revenue.

Motion:               Director Tisdale made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the December 19th, 2017 Board Meeting.

Director Anderson seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Ms. McKillop noted that the Board had previously adopted the 2018 performance measures, but she stated that the Board must vote on three additional measures each year following the adoption of the budget.

Jannette Scarpino, Senior Manager of Budget and Financial Analysis, said the performance measures in question were 6.2, regarding overall ridership increase, and 6.3 regarding increased fare revenue and operating revenue.

Director Williams said she had a hard time agreeing with the recommended action, because the Board had just heard a report saying that ridership was decreasing, and she noted that fares would not be increased in 2018.

Ms. Scarpino said the performance measures dealt with revenue ridership, which she said was a difficult number to forecast. She said the performance measures had increased because of the anticipated opening of the G Line and the continued ridership of the G Line. She said that staff was fairly comfortable with their projections and would revisit the performance measures in the amended budget.

Director Folska said she would support the recommended action.

Director Menten shared Director Williams’ concerns. She said that she had seen a decreasing trend in boardings and had expressed her concerns with Ms. McKillop, but she noted the performance measures could be adjusted later on. She noted that people were using alternative means of transportation.

Ms. McKillop reiterated that the performance measures were based upon the G Line opening and said that the measures did not anticipate an increase in Base system ridership.

Director Lubow asked whether the 3.4% increase in ridership was entirely due to increased rail ridership, and Ms. Scarpino responded that was correct.

Director Anderson noted the pent up ridership demand in Arvada and stated her community had already built TOD.

Chair Hoy asked for the estimated ridership of the G Line, and Ms. McKillop said that she would provide those figures to the Board.

Committee Chair Menten declared the motion PASSED.

##### a. 2018 updated final performance measures

#### 1. October 2017 Monthly Financials

Doug MacLeod, Controller, stated that his report was half green, indicating positive numbers, and half red, indicating negative numbers. He said the red numbers were mostly due to declining ridership. He said the agency was doing better than expected in relation to sales and use tax revenues. He stated the agency anticipated lower revenues, largely, due to the loss of marijuana sales tax revenue but in fact the opposite happened. He stated that revenues were 1.8% above budget in June and 2.7% above in October, yielding an additional $13 million. He noted that revenues from hotels and restaurants lead the way in increases, possibly due to low unemployment, and that car sales were flat. He stated that internet tax revenues doubled in October, from a monthly average of $600,000 to $1.3 million in October. He said that revenue bus ridership was down and light rail ridership was up because of the R Line but flat year over year. He said that fare revenue year over year increased 5.4%. He noted revenue at ticket vending machines (TVMs) was up significantly, largely to University of Colorado A Line ridership, and that bus fare box revenue was down slightly. He stated that sales of passes were flat year over year. He stated that revenues from mobile ticketing would show up in the monthly financial statements starting in November 2017.

Director Tisdale asked whether tax revenues would have been even higher if the marijuana sales tax had not been repealed.

Mr. MacLeod agreed but noted that certain retailers were still collecting marijuana taxes. He said that vendors had submitted $114,000 from recreational marijuana sales and $200,000 from medical marijuana sales in October.

Ms. McKillop stated that the budget forecast called for $6 million in marijuana sales tax revenue in 2017, though the projected amount of overall marijuana sales was increasing.

Director Williams said that RTD’s service was made up of 10% rail services and 90% bus services. She said that bus ridership was not increasing and stated that, if the agency wanted to remain in the positive, rail usage would have to increase tenfold to compensate for bus ridership losses.

Ms. McKillop said that people were migrating to rail for regional and airport services, which were more expensive than local service. She said that, assuming the G Line opened in early 2018, the agency would see additional regional fare sales and transfers at Denver Union Station for service to the airport. She said that fare revenue would increase even though ridership would not.

Director Lubow asked Mr. MacLeod to explain year-over-year decline in ridership of 9.3% for the month of October.

Mr. MacLeod said he would look into it but suggested the decline may have to do with projections that were based upon the G Line opening in 2017.

Mr. Abel said that the agency had been following a strategy of removing bus service and replacing it with rail service. He said the agency should participate G Line and overall FasTracks ridership to increase, though a decrease in bus ridership should be expected as well, due to the elimination of bus lanes precipitated by the G Line opening. As for the October decline, he posited the drop could be the result of the agency’s new ridership count methodology.

Director Menten asked whether ridership had increased on the R Line.

Mr. Abel said that the R Line ridership was well below projections and said he would review the boardings per hour.

Director Menten asked whether Aurora had stepped up their advertising of the R Line.

General Manager Genova said that he and Mr. Reed had met with leaders from Aurora to discuss how to message and market the R Line. He said the group put together a list of joint activities.

Director Williams asked whether part of the agency’s problem was basing its actions off of projections.

Ms. McKillop said that the agency needed to rely on projections and stated that some of the agency’s assumptions for 2018 were based on the opening of the G Line. She said that adjustments could be made later on.

Director Williams noted that the agency had made adjustments based on the change in the CU Leeds forecast and that she did not want to see the agency continue to overproject.

Ms. McKillop said that projections are only estimates and that the agency never hits them but would continue to review the ridership model.

Director Tisdale said that he had a conversation with the Director of Communications from Aurora regarding the city’s promotion of the R Line via the city’s public information television channel.

Director Folska asked whether ridership projections should have been reduced once it was known that the G Line would not open on time.

Ms. McKillop said that the agency’s practice has been to adjust numbers during budget time.

Director Folska suggested that this discussion be considered during the future opening of the N Line. She also asked whether City Aurora City Planner Mac Callison was included in the conversation regarding the marketing of the R Line.

General Manager Genova said he was involved in the conversation.

Director Folska asked whether the agency should build a broader coalition, with the Aurora Economic Development Council, the Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG), and others.

General Manager Genova said that the agency was trying to reach out to all stakeholders. He noted that 2,200 residential units were scheduled to open along the R Line and said that communications could go directly to the residents.
