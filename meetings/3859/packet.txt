Our responsibility, as described by professional
standards, is to express an opinion about whether the
financial statements prepared by management with your
oversight are fairly presented, in all material respects, in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.

•

Our audit of the financial statements does not relieve
you or management of your responsibilities.

Audit Plan

We identified the following areas during our brainstorming session related to
significant risks of misstatement:
•

Management override of controls

•

Proper recording of revenue, including accounting treatment for grant funding
received by RTD including accuracy and completeness of the Schedule of
Federal Awards (SEFA)

•

Risk related to management’s process for developing accounting estimates as it
relates to the net pension liability

Attachment: RTD - Pre-Audit Meeting - FYE 2025 (5221 : External Auditor Pre-Audit Communications)

1.C.1.a

Packet Pg. 11

In response to these identified significant risks, we will perform the following:
•

Testing of journal entries recorded in the general ledger and other adjustments
made in the preparation of the financial statements.

•

Review and test that there were no gaps in controls during the year for those
involved in key controls, including reviewing to ensure proper updates to
banking and general ledger system access, due to employee departures during
the year.

•

Review for any significant fluctuations to revenue as well as assess whether
grant funding was spent in accordance with related agreements and that related
transactions are recorded correctly in the general ledger.

•

Test and assess the completeness of the SEFA in conjunction with the Single
Audit of Federal Awards and reconcile grant revenues to amounts recorded in
the financial statements

•

Review and obtain support for the inputs, methods and assumptions used by
management in arriving at the estimate related to the net pension liability

Audit Plan

1.C.1.a

Packet Pg. 12

• We will gain an understanding of accounting processes and key internal controls
through a review of the accounting procedures questionnaires and control
procedures questionnaires prepared by management.
• We will confirm through observation and inspection procedures that accounting
procedures and controls included in the questionnaires have been implemented.
• We will not express an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting; however, we will communicate to you significant deficiencies
and material weaknesses identified in connection with our audit.
• The concept of materiality is inherent in our work. We place greater emphasis
on those items that have, on a relative basis, more importance to the financial
statements and greater possibilities of material error than with those items of
lesser importance or those in which the possibility of material error is remote.

his continued service on the Committee for one year. As such, his eligibility to service on the Committee
expires November 17, 2025.
On September 4, 2025, Board Chair Julien Bouquet put out a call to the Board soliciting interest from

Chris Gutschenritter, Director Michael Guzman, and Director Matt Larsen. The interested Directors
submitted their documents to the Board Office, which then forwarded those documents to the

1.D.1.a

COMPOSITION
The Audit Committee will consist of at least three and no more than five members, all of whom, in the judgment of
the Board of Directors, shall be independent in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations. To qualify as
independent, an audit committee member may not be employed by, or provide any services to, the organization
beyond their duties as a committee member or Board Member. The members should collectively possess sufficient
knowledge of audit, finance, specific industry knowledge, IT, law, governance, risk, and control. Because the
responsibilities of the Audit Committee evolves in response to regulatory, economic, and reporting developments, it
is important to periodically re-evaluate members’ competencies and the overall balance of skills on the committee in
response to emerging needs. At least one member shall be designated as the "financial expert," as defined by
applicable legislation and regulation.
The Board of Directors shall have three members of the Audit Committee, each of whom shall have served on the
Board of Directors for at least one year. Should a Director cease to maintain a position on the Board of Directors,
such a Director can, with the approval of the Board of Directors, continue to serve on the Audit Committee for a
period of up to one year.
The members of the Audit Committee, by a majority vote, will designate a chair and vice chair, for a period of one
year
The term of office for an Audit Committee member is two years for a Board Member, except for two initial one-year
terms upon initial formation of the Audit Committee. Board Members will have a two-year term, staggered with at
least two Board members’ terms overlapping an election year. External members of the Audit Committee will have
two or three-year terms, staggered to overlap election years. Continuance of Audit Committee members will be
reviewed annually. To ensure continuity within the Audit Committee, the appointment of members should be
staggered to avoid full turnover in the Audit Committee.
Each member of the Audit Committee shall serve for such term or terms as the Board may determine or until his or
her earlier resignation, removal or death. Any vacancy on the Committee shall be filled by the Board. No member of
the Audit Committee shall be removed as a member, except upon the affirmative vote of ten Directors.
MEETINGS
The Audit Committee will meet at least four times a year, with authority to convene additional meetings, as
circumstances require. All committee members are expected to attend each meeting, in person or virtually, and are
obligated to prepare for and participate in meetings. The quorum for the Audit Committee will be a majority of its
members.
The Chief Audit Executive (as defined in the internal audit charter) and Chief Financial Officer are required to attend
all Audit Committee meetings. The Chief Audit Executive or designee will facilitate and coordinate meetings as well
as provide ancillary support to the committee, as time and resources permit.
Meeting agendas will be prepared in consultation with Audit Committee members, management, and its auditors, to
be provided in advance to members, along with appropriate briefing materials. Minutes will be prepared and all
documentation related to the Audit Committee and its dealings may be subject to the Colorado Open Records Act,
C.R.S. § 24-72-201 et seq., as amended. The Audit Committee will provide updates to the Board of Directors at least
quarterly.
The Audit Committee will invite members of management or others to attend meetings and provide pertinent
information, as necessary.
Audit Committee members will receive formal orientation training on the purpose and mandate of the committee and
on the organization’s objectives. A process of continuing education will be established.

Report Rating Definitions
Report ratings are utilized to communicate the aggregate compliance or risk observed for the in-scope location,
process, or system.

Satisfactory

The in-scope areas of the project are generally in compliance with applicable policies and procedures. The design and
effectiveness of internal controls appear to be adequate. Exceptions noted were isolated and/or minor, and
departures from leading practices are minimal (as applicable).

Needs Improvement

The in-scope areas of the project, although generally in compliance with policies and procedures, have certain
deficiencies with the design or effectiveness of internal controls which should be improved. Some departures from
leading practices have been identified, creating opportunities for process or efficiency improvement or for improved
financial statement accuracy.

Unsatisfactory

The in-scope areas of the project are in substantial non-compliance with policies and procedures, and the design or
effectiveness of internal controls is not adequate. Multiple and/or significant departures from leading practice may be
present, creating operational inefficiency. If such deficiencies are not corrected, the company can be exposed to loss
or financial misstatement.

1.E.1.a

Risk/Impact: Observation that presents a high risk to the agency and/or is of high importance to business success/achievement of goals. Conditions exist or
situations could occur which could have a significant adverse impact (i.e., financial, reputational, etc.) to the business. Significant audit observations may include
conditions dealing with irregularities, illegal acts, financial reporting errors, inefficiencies, waste, ineffectiveness, conflicts of interest, and control weaknesses. In
addition, an observation is considered High Priority if a finding creates a large exposure that could result in a loss of system control, access, application control,
and/or exposure of data via the compromise of administrative accounts and/or other system functions. It could also create an exposure of confidentiality or
integrity.

High Priority

The relevant risks associated with the observation may be considered high due to one or more of the following conditions:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Significant financial impact for location/site audited
Prevalence of issues or exceptions
Circumvention of controls, Management wrong-doing and/or willful disregard of company policy or regulatory requirements
Non-compliance with US/Local laws or regulations
Disruption to operations and/or significant reputational exposures
Unremediated previously identified control observations or a history of similar issues, although minor, may be considered a high priority
classification.

Urgency of Action Plan: Corrective action is required within three months, or other time period deemed reasonable by both Management and Internal Audit.

Moderate Priority

Low Priority /
Process
Improvement

Risk/Impact: The observation in the report relates to ineffective or insufficient controls to manage key business risks. The risks associated could lead to financial
statement errors and losses, operational inefficiencies (including financial system and IT issues), or result in instances of policy and regulatory non-compliance as
well as potential reputational damages, fines, and penalties.
Urgency of Action Plan: Corrective actions should be implemented within the next six months, or other time period deemed reasonable by both Management and
Internal Audit.
Risk/Impact: Other findings identified during fieldwork that are isolated or minor control gaps for business cycles not in-scope for the audit, observations to
improve financial and/or operational efficiency, or are designed to assist management in improving the operating capacity of the department and/or activity.
These recommendations do not impact the overall rating.
Urgency of Action Plan: While not necessarily a priority, corrective action should occur within the next 12 months.

Internal Audit Observations and Recommendations
Observation 1

PCard Policy and Program Enhancements

Risk Rating:
Moderate Priority

Internal Audit Observation:
The Purchasing Card Procedures (Policy) in effect during the audit period states the last revision was in December 2016.
The current Policy lacks clarity and consistency in the following areas:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Prohibits certain transactions, such as food purchases, yet in practice these are allowed with managerial preauthorization.
Includes undefined terms such as hardware, software, and food, leading to inconsistent interpretations.
Does not provide responsibilities and defined approval timelines for Manager/Approvers and PCard
Administrators.
Does not require attestation for missing receipts.
Does not require PCard holders to include a clear and specific business purpose for each transaction as part of
the reconciliation process.
Does not include a Review or Change Log documenting review dates or revisions made by the Policy owner.

Cause:
The Policy has not been formally updated since December 1, 2016.
Risks:
Failure to maintain an updated Policy could lead to increased risk of misuse or fraud, lack of accountability and
inconsistent practices across the agency.
Without clear definitions and guidance, PCard holders and approvers may unintentionally make unauthorized purchases
and apply inconsistent judgment leading to Policy violations.
Absence of a defined timeline for Manager approval could lead to delays in the monthly PCard reconciliation process.
Failure to submit supporting documentation (receipts) or provide a documented business purpose for transactions may
indicate an attempt to conceal prohibited activity while also reducing transparency and increasing the risk of financial
loss.

1.E.1.b

Report No. 2025-04 Purchase Card (PCard) Program Review
Internal Audit Report
Issued: October 31, 2025
Recommendation:
Management should consider a scheduled periodic review and update of the Policy. Any updates to the Policy should be
communicated to all PCard holders and Approvers and the Policy should be easily accessible to PCard holders and
Approvers for future reference.
•
•

•
•
•

•
•
•

Clarify exceptions to prohibited transactions, as the Policy currently prohibits certain transactions such as food,
yet these purchases are allowed in practice with manager pre-authorization.
Define ambiguous terms referenced in the Policy, such as hardware, software and food. For example, the lack of
clarity creates uncertainty around whether cloud-based services are considered software, whether computer
peripherals (e.g., webcams, mice, printers) fall under hardware, and whether snacks and refreshments qualify as
food.
Define Manager/Approver and PCard Administrator roles and responsibilities.
Include a defined approval timeline related to the Manager’s review and approval of the PCard holder’s
reconciliation, along with the implications for non-compliance.
Require the PCard holder to complete and submit a Missing Receipt Affidavit when transaction supporting
documentation cannot be provided (missing receipt). The Missing Receipt Affidavit should describe the
product(s) or service(s), date purchased or rendered, merchant and summary of actions taken to obtain a
replacement receipt.
Require the reconciler (PCard holder or delegate) to document the business purpose for each transaction in the
Oracle Expense Justification field. The purpose should clearly state the business need for the purchase.
For PCard Statement periods with no activity, require the PCard holder to submit an attestation or confirmation
that follows the review and approval workflow within Oracle.
Include a Review/Change Log section within the Policy to track date of review and revisions, including dates of
changes, description of changes and approval dates.

Management should consider developing a PCard risk matrix by identifying Policy compliance, waste, fraud and abuse
risks and evaluating each risk for impact and likelihood to rate as high, moderate, or low. The mitigating control(s) for
each risk should be identified, along with the absence of mitigating controls (control gaps).
Management Action Plan:
RTD to update current PCard policy and program documents incorporating the above requirements with a change log for
future policy and program version updates by 11/30/25. Incorporate recommended updates into Oracle review platform
to the extent possible; include requirements for above items in upcoming Oracle Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)
update. Develop risk matrix for PCard program by 1/31/26.

Observation 2
Observation Title:
PCard Program Training

Risk Rating:
Moderate Priority

Periodic refresher training is not required or provided for PCard holders. PCard holder training is only provided at the time
of initial card issuance, to address Policy compliance issues, or upon request. Additionally, no training exists for the
PCard Manager/Approvers or PCard Administrators to educate them on the policies, procedures and roles and
responsibilities related to the PCard Program.
Cause:
A formal training program is not in place for PCard holders, Approvers and PCard Administrators.
Risks:
Failure to provide formal training to PCard holders, Manager/Approvers and PCard Administrators could lead to individuals
being unaware of key responsibilities, inappropriate acceptance of non-compliant PCard activity, and increased risk of
misuse and non-compliance with policy and procedures.
Failure to obtain acknowledgement of training completed by key roles could lead to individuals claiming ignorance or
unawareness of responsibilities and/or requirements. Further, inappropriate use of an RTD issued PCard, if publicly
disclosed, could result in reputational harm to the agency.
Recommendation:
Management should consider developing and implementing a formal training program for PCard holders,
Manager/Approvers and PCard Administrators. The training should address roles, responsibilities, and RTD’s PCard
policies and procedures. The specific training programs by role may include:
•
•

•

PCard holder: Focus on appropriate use of the PCard, transaction documentation, utilizing purchase orders
versus PCard, monthly reconciliation requirement and timelines, prohibited purchases and consequences of
misuse.
Manager/Approver: Focus on reviewing and validating transactions and supporting documentation, identifying
red flags, monthly reconciliation requirements and timelines, enforcing policy compliance and escalation
procedures.
PCard Administrator: Focus on program setup, card issuance and user access controls, policy enforcement and
exception handling.

Management should consider conducting periodic refresher training with documented acknowledgement for PCard
holders, Manager/Approvers and PCard Administrators. Training should be conducted at least annually or after Policy
revisions.

Observation 3
Observation Title:
PCard Application Process

Risk Rating:
Moderate Priority

The review of the 25 selected Purchasing Card Applications (Applications) and Cardholder Agreements (Agreements)
resulted in the following:
• Two of 25 (8%) Applications lacked one of the required signatures.
• Two of 25 (8%) Agreements did not maintain the entire agreement; only the signature page was maintained.
The Application does not require the printed name and title of the approving Manager or approving Assistant General
Manager (AGM). During the review, instances were noted where it was difficult to determine the approver based on
signature only.
Applications and agreements are physically stored separately by each PCard Administrator and not stored electronically in
a centralized repository.
Cause:
The required signatures were not obtained due to oversight by the PCard Administrator.
The fully executed PCard Agreements were not maintained or stored in an electronic, centralized repository due to lack of
administrative procedures.
Risks:
Failure to obtain approval by all parties required by the Policy could lead to unapproved PCard issuance and/or lack of
management awareness of the issuance.
Absence of printed name and title of Manager, AGM and PCard Administrator on the Application may result in the inability
to verify the identity and authorization of the approving party.
Failure to retain the complete PCard Agreement could lead to unclear obligations of the PCard holder and RTD.
Inability to access Applications and Agreements electronically may limit accessibility for the PCard department and hinder
the PCard Administrator’s ability to provide proper management and oversight.
Recommendation:
Management should consider reformatting the Application to include the printed name and title of each approver, along
with the signature and date. In instances where the Manager and AGM are the same person, the Application should
provide an indicator (i.e. checkbox) requiring the approver to enter information and sign once or require the approver to
sign for each role.
Management should consider when revisions to the Agreement’s terms and conditions occur, requiring all PCard holders
to execute an updated Agreement. If Agreement revisions are not anticipated in the near-term, it is recommended that
each PCard holder execute a new Agreement, along with the applicable management approval, to reinforce
understanding of and compliance with the Policy.
Management should consider storing the Applications and entire Agreements in a centralized, electronic repository in
compliance with the agency’s IT and document retention policies for accessibility and retention.

Observation 4
Observation Title:
Monthly PCard Statement Reconciliation Process

Risk Rating:
Moderate Priority

The review of the 25 selected PCard Statement reconciliations performed through Oracle Expense Reports resulted in the
following (PCard reconciliations may have multiple exceptions):
•
•

Seven of 25 (28%) Oracle Expense Reports were submitted by the PCard holder and/or approved by the Manager
after the published due date. Late submission by the PCard holder causing delinquent Manager approval was not
deemed an exception, unless the Manager approval occurred more than one day after the submission.
Three of 25 (12%) Oracle Expense Report totals did not agree to the related PCard Statement totals (i.e., not all
transactions from the PCard Statement were reflected in the Oracle Expense Report).

PCard Administrators asserted that 25% of the PCard Statements selected for testing did not have PCard activity for the
period and alternate PCard Statements were selected for testing.
Cause:
The late reconciliation submission by the reconciler (PCard holder or delegate) may be due to lack of prioritization by the
responsible parties. The late Manager approval may be due to the Policy not defining the timing of the Manager approval.
The difference in expense totals between the PCard Statement and Oracle Expense Report may be due to the reconciler
selecting different dates in Oracle compared to the PCard Statement period or not selecting transactions listed in Oracle,
which could result in unreconciled transactions. Additionally, the expense total differences may not be detected due to
lack of verification to ensure the Oracle Expense Report and the PCard Statement totals agree.
Risks:
Failure to provide Oracle general ledger account coding may result in additional administrative effort to ensure the
transaction is recorded correctly for financial reporting.
Absence of transactions on the monthly reconciliation may be avoidance of required responsibility and could potentially
mask errors or fraudulent behavior.
Recommendation:
Management should consider updating the PCard Policy to define the required timing for the Manager’s review and
approval of the PCard holder’s reconciliation, along with the implications for non-compliance.
Management should consider researching to determine if an automated control can be utilized in Oracle to ensure the
PCard Statement and Oracle Expense Report totals agree. Additionally, management should consider educating the
Manager/Approver to verify the PCard Statement and Oracle Expense Report totals agree. If the totals do not agree, the
Manager/Approver should reject the reconciliation and require the PCard holder to resolve and resubmit.

Observation 5
Observation Title:
PCard Transaction Compliance and Documentation

Risk Rating:
Moderate Priority

The review of 340 transactions associated with the 25 selected PCard Statements resulted in the following Policy
violations (PCard transactions may have multiple exceptions):
•

•
•
•

•

33 of 340 (10%) transactions did not include supporting documentation, the documentation detail was
insufficient (such as item description, quantity and unit price), or the documentation total did not agree to the
Oracle Expense Report amount.
o 19 transactions lacked support such as item description, quantity, unit price
o Eight transactions did not include supporting documentation
o Six transactions included supporting documentation that did not match key transaction details such as
amount or transaction date
11 of 340 (3%) transactions included food purchases which are prohibited by Policy. Although current practice
permits such purchases with written management pre-authorization, the Policy does not recognize this approval
as permissible.
10 of 340 (3%) transactions included tax charges. Tax charge dispute support was not included in the Oracle
PCard Packet.
Three of 340 (<1%) transactions did not include pre-authorization documentation as required by the Policy in the
Oracle PCard Packet.
o Two transactions were for hardware and software
o One transaction was for an out-of-town seminar registration
Two (<1%) of 340 transactions included nominal donations to St. Jude Hospital.

Cause:
Lack of PCard holder and Approver awareness or understanding of Policy requirements.
Risks:
Unawareness of issues or lack of remediation by PCard holder may allow continued non-compliance and increase the risk
of misuse or fraudulent activity.
Reliance on transaction summary receipt without underlying transaction detail (itemization) inhibits the reviewer/approver
ability to determine whether the transaction is compliant with the Policy and the business purpose.
The absence of documented business practices may compromise internal controls, increase the risk of information loss
and lead to Policy violation.
Failure to apply the agency’s tax-exempt status may lead to non-compliance with the Policy and result in unrecoverable
financial losses.

Management should consider reinforcing the PCard Policy through mandatory training (see Observation #2).
Management should consider requiring PCard holders to provide documentation for disputed tax charges and include it in
the PCard Packet. Additionally, it is recommended that tax charge disputes be tracked until resolved.
Management should consider reviewing current business practices and revising the Policy where appropriate.

Management Action Plan:
Update the PCard Policy to reflect requirements for PCard holders to provide documentation for disputed tax charges if a
tax is reflected on a PCard purchase. Include tracking tax charge disputes until resolution in PCard Administrator
responsibility document.
Update the PCard Policy to better reflect requirements regarding itemization and detail when submitting approval
requests. Include examples in PCard Holder training documents. Clarify in PCard Policy and training that failure to comply
will be considered a violation of the policy.
Include the above items in the elements for non-compliance by Managers/Approvers that could subject them to
disciplinary implications.

Observation 6
Observation Title:
PCard Administrator Review

Risk Rating:
Moderate Priority

The PCard Administrators do not maintain documented evidence of the monthly review of the PCard activity including
corrective actions required and resolution. The PCard Administrators currently conduct PCard reconciliation reviews using
independently developed approaches, including utilizing different sample size selections and information/reports available
to assist with the review.
One PCard Administrator is also a PCard holder and is responsible for conducting reviews on their own PCard activity;
however, they are not assigned as their own Manager/Approver of the PCard.
Cause:
A standard process was not implemented for performing and documenting the monthly PCard Administrator reviews.
Risks:
Lack of standardized review methodology and maintaining evidence of the review could lead to inconsistency among
reviews over time and be interpreted as the absence of the monthly review being performed.
Absence of a formal tracking function or tool to document PCard Administrator review, along with exceptions noted and
required remediation actions to be taken may lead to continued non-compliance or missed educational/training
opportunities.
Lack of standard review process may lead to increased risk of misuse, fraud and abuse.
Recommendation:
Management should consider developing and implementing a standardized process for documenting the PCard
Administrator’s monthly review of PCard activity. The process should include the following:
•
•
•
•

A monthly review checklist or template identifying reviewer, PCard holder, statement date and key review
attributes.
Retention of annotated statements or logs of reviewed transactions along with clear documentation of any
exceptions, follow-up actions taken and resolution.
Verification of PCard Statement total and Oracle Expense Report total match.
PCard Administrator sign-off confirming completion of the review.

Management should consider prohibiting PCard Administrators from being assigned to review their own PCard activity.

Observation 7
Observation Title:
PCard Transaction Data Analytics

Risk Rating:
Low/Process Improvement

RTD does not utilize data analytics tools or techniques to monitor, analyze or detect patterns in the PCard transaction
data. Transaction oversight is primarily limited to manual, individual review of monthly statements and reconciliations by
approvers and PCard Administrators which may not be sufficient to identify trends, anomalies or potential misuse
effectively.
Cause:
This is due to limited resources to automate the analysis, and personnel may lack the training and processes needed to
implement a data-driven monitoring process.
Risks:
Lack of PCard transaction data analytics could lead to increased risk of undetected fraud, waste or Policy violations. It
could also lead to limited visibility into the overall PCard spending patterns and Policy adherence as well as missed
opportunities to identify high-risk vendors, departments or PCard holders.
Lack of transaction-level data analysis may inhibit the PCard Administration ability to timely detect abnormal and/or noncompliant activity.
Overreliance on manual review could lead to incomplete or inaccurate reconciliation of PCard activity and delays in
identifying policy violations.
Recommendation:
Management should consider implementing a data analytics process as part of the PCard Administrators role to enhance
oversight of PCard activity. Key components of the process would include:
•
•
•
•

Identifying and utilizing a data analysis tool (i.e., Excel, Power BI, Tableau) to analyze transaction data.
Developing standard queries for split transactions, duplicate charges, weekend/holiday purchases, high-risk
Merchant Category Codes (MCCs).
Developing trend analysis reports by vendor, department or PCard holders.
Investigating outliers and flagged transactions regularly with documented outcomes.

Management should consider conducting analysis of historic PCard activity at the transaction level to identify trends,
characteristics and abnormal activity to establish a baseline for monthly analysis.

Observation 8
Observation Title:
PCard Management Tool

Risk Rating:
Low/Process Improvement

RTD currently does not utilize a centralized PCard management tool to facilitate oversight and administration of the PCard
program resulting in manual or fragmented handling of key processes such as application tracking, agreement
management, transaction review and reconciliations, and policy enforcement.
Cause:
A PCard management system has not been implemented to streamline and standardize administrative functions related to
PCard holder activity, approvals, and compliance monitoring.
Risks:
The absence of a centralized PCard tool increases the risk of inadequate oversight, delayed identification of unauthorized
transactions, inconsistent policy enforcement and operational inefficiencies which could increase the likelihood of fraud,
misuse of funds and non-compliance with Policy.
Recommendation:
Management should consider implementing a management tool specifically designed for PCard Programs that imports
transaction data from the PCard issuer/bank and interfaces with RTD’s ERP system. The management tool should be
capable of ensuring all transactions are imported, reconciled and supported, and reviewed by appropriate parties.
Additionally, the tools should track non-compliance issues identified, communication of the issue, and remediation actions
taken to resolve.
Management Action Plan:
RTD to investigate available PCard management tools and related costs, requirements, etc. RTD to include PCard
management for PCard program in the requirements for its upcoming ERP solicitation which provides robust abilities to
capture, reconcile, review, and report transaction data as well as to track compliance issues, communications, training
certification, etc.

Observation 9
Observation Title:
Role-Based Merchant Category Code (MCC) Restrictions

Risk Rating:
Low/Process Improvement

The PCard Program currently utilizes a general set of Merchant Category Code (MCC) restrictions for all PCard holders
regardless of their role or department. While the general restriction helps prevent certain high-risk purchases, it does not
account for specific purchasing needs or risk level of individual PCard holders and could lead to either overly restrictive
access that hinders legitimate business needs or overly permissive access and increased risk.
Cause:
This is due to the use of a default MCC restriction for all PCard holders and the absence of a role-based MCC assignment
framework.
Risks:
Lack of a role-based MCC assignment framework may allow PCard holders to have access to purchase goods and services
outside the scope of their job responsibilities, increasing the risk of unauthorized, non-compliant or fraudulent
transactions.
Recommendation:
Management should consider implementing role-based MCC restrictions framework that aligns purchasing access with
department specific needs. The restrictions should be applied based on PCard holder’s role, responsibility and nature of
goods and services they are authorized to purchase.
Management Action Plan:
RTD to investigate current capabilities for greater MCC restrictions with its current bank. If available, RTD to review each
PCard holder’s role and responsibilities and create role-based MCC assignments for each.
Responsibility:
Dana Steele, Contracting and Procurement

Observation 10
Observation Title:
Procurement Cost Efficiencies

Risk Rating:
Low/Process Improvement

PCard transaction testing identified instances where PCard holders purchased similar products or services—such as office
supplies, IT accessories, and maintenance items—from multiple merchants. These purchases are typically covered under
existing vendor agreements or centralized contracts. The PCard Policy does require PCard holders to consider open
contracts, purchase orders and blanket purchase orders before using the PCard.
Cause:
Lack of awareness or training among PCard holders regarding existing procurement agreements and the requirement to
consult centralized procurement resources prior to making purchases.
Risks:
Use of PCards for regular and/or recurring purchases from merchants could increase the likelihood of taxes being
incurred, loss of volume discounts, and increase of PCard reconciliation and review time.
Recommendation:
Management should consider the implementation of blanket purchase contracts for regular and/or recurring activities to
optimize volume discounts and reduce administrative costs, to achieve the cost-effective use of invoicing compared to
PCard use. Additionally, management should consider training PCard holders on how to identify and utilize existing
contracts and purchase orders prior to initiating purchases on the PCard.
Management Action Plan:
RTD to identify recurring and regular purchases made on PCards and create a schedule to move certain purchases to
blanket purchase order (BPOs) contracts. Once list is compiled, work with project teams for transition to BPOs. Create
goals for number or percentage of contracts to move to BPOs in 2026 based upon number of anticipated BPOs and
complexity of transitions.

Risk/Impact: Observation that presents a high risk to the agency and/or is of high importance to business
success/achievement of goals. Conditions exist or situations could occur which could have a significant adverse
impact (i.e., financial, reputational, etc.) on the business. Significant audit observations may include conditions
dealing with irregularities, illegal acts, financial reporting errors, inefficiencies, waste, ineffectiveness, conflicts
of interest, and control weaknesses. In addition, an observation is considered High Priority if a finding creates
a large exposure that could result in a loss of system control, access, application control, and/or exposure of
data via the compromise of administrative accounts and/or other system functions. It could also create an
exposure of confidentiality or integrity.

High Priority

The relevant risks associated with the observation may be considered high due to one or more of the following
conditions:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Significant financial impact for location/site audited
Prevalence of issues or exceptions
Circumvention of controls, Management wrong-doing and/or willful disregard of company policy or
regulatory requirements
Non-compliance with US/Local laws or regulations
Disruption to operations and/or significant reputational exposures
Unremediated previously identified control observations or a history of similar issues, although minor,
may be considered a high priority classification.

Urgency of Action Plan: Corrective action is required within three months, or other time period deemed
reasonable by both Management and Internal Audit.

Moderate
Priority

Risk/Impact: The observation in the report relates to ineffective or insufficient controls to manage key
business risks. The risks associated could lead to financial statement errors and losses, operational
inefficiencies (including financial system and IT issues) or result in instances of policy and regulatory
non-compliance as well as potential reputational damages, fines, and penalties.
Urgency of Action Plan: Corrective actions should be implemented within the next six months, or other time
period deemed reasonable by both Management and Internal Audit.

Low Priority/
Process
Improvement

Risk/Impact: Other findings were identified during fieldwork that are isolated or minor control gaps for
business cycles not in-scope for the audit, observations to improve financial and/or operational efficiency, or
are designed to assist management in improving the operating capacity of the department and/or activity.
These recommendations do not impact on the overall rating.
Urgency of Action Plan: While not necessarily a priority, corrective action should occur within the next
12 months.

Background

Overall Summary/Highlights

In 2022, RTD contracted with RubinBrown LLP to serve as its
Internal Audit provider to perform internal audits and other
consultative functions.

The audit team rated two audit observations as Moderate
Priority, and three audit observations as Low/Process
Improvement. As a result, an overall report rating of
‘Satisfactory’ was assigned.

This Board of Directors Expense Reimbursement review is a
Board-approved Internal Audit Plan project.
RubinBrown LLP and Dietrich Partners prepared the report for
use by the Board of Directors, Audit Committee, and RTD
management.
Recommendations for improvement are presented for
management’s consideration, and management is responsible
for the effective implementation of corrective action plans.

Observation 1
Observation Title:
RTD Board of Directors Expense and Reimbursement Policy Enhancements

Risk Rating:
Moderate Priority

Internal Audit Observation:
The RTD Board of Directors Expense and Reimbursement Policy (Policy) does not include provisions for delegation of
authority to prepare and submit expense reports on behalf of other individuals. Currently, many expense reports are
prepared by Board Office personnel and an image of the Director’s signature is applied. Additionally, the Policy lacks
defined timelines for approvers to review and approve submitted reports. The acceptable methods of approval such as
signature on the expense form or by email are not clearly specified.
Cause:
The Policy has not been updated to reflect operational practices.
Risks:
Lack of formal delegation may result in expense reports being prepared and submitted by individuals without proper
authority, increasing the risk of unauthorized or inaccurate submissions and diminished accountability.
The absence of defined timelines for approvers to review and approve expense reports may result in delays in
processing, which can affect timely reimbursements and financial reporting.
Lack of clear guidance on acceptable approval methods may lead to unauthorized or unverifiable approvals.
Recommendation:
Management should consider revising the Policy to formally define delegation of authority, including the requirement for
the Director or authorized delegate to sign the expense report on behalf of the Director. The Policy should also require
all delegations be documented, clearly identifying authorized individuals, the duration of their delegated authority and
maintaining a record of delegations.
Management should revise the Policy to define specific timelines for approvers to review and approve submitted expense
reports. Additionally, the Policy should clarify acceptable methods of approvals, such as physical signatures on the
expense form or documented emails approvals. When email approval is used, the approving email should be retained
and attached to the expense report to ensure proper documentation and accountability.

Internal Audit Report
Issued: October 31, 2025

Management Action Plan:
The Board Office will work with the Executive Committee and full Board to revise the Board’s Expense and
Reimbursement Policy to:
1. Delegate authority to the Board Office staff to prepare expense reports on behalf of Directors
2. Clearly define what specific documentation will support the approval of an expense report (i.e. email from
approver and/or approval of expense form submission)
3. Define the timeline for approval of an expense report following submission (i.e. 5-10 business days)
Additionally, the Board Office will create a new expense reimbursement request form utilizing available solutions through
Microsoft 365. This expense form can be accessed only by a Director logged into their RTD account and will include a
required authorization box Directors will check authorizing Board Office staff to submit expenses for approval based on
the information provided in the form. That form will then also be routed to the appropriate approval authority for
approval via a similar method.

Internal Audit Report
Issued: October 31, 2025

Observation Title:
Non-Compliance with Board of Directors Expense and Reimbursement Policy

Risk Rating:
Moderate Priority

Internal Audit Observation:
The review of 233 Board of Director’s Local and Travel Expense Reports identified the following non-compliance with
the Policy (expense reports may have multiple exceptions):
•
•
•
•
•
•

•

124 (53%) Local and Travel Expense Reports either lacked a submission date or were not submitted in the
required timelines.
20 of the 34 (59%) Zero Expense Reports were not submitted as required by the Policy.
34 of the 46 (74%) Local and Travel Expense Reports with mileage reimbursement did not properly allocate
the first 30 miles to the Director’s account and the remaining mileage to the Board Office account when
entered into Oracle.
18 (8%) Local and Travel Expense Reports were missing the Director signature or included a signature that did
not match the authorized signature on file.
11 (5%) Local and Travel Expense Reports lacked required itemized support or explanation of business
purpose.
Four (2%) Local and Travel Expense Reports contained inaccurate or incomplete information.
 Two Local Expense Reports included receipts that were not listed on the Expense Report.
 One Local Expense Report included gratuity exceeding the 20% policy limit.
 One Travel Expense Report applied an incorrect Per Diem rate, resulting in overpayment.
Four (2%) of the Local and Travel Expense Reports expenses were coded to the incorrect Oracle General
Ledger account.

Cause:
Although submission timelines are outlined in the Policy, Directors frequently submit expense documentation late,
contributing to reporting errors and compounding operational inefficiencies.
Lack of refresher training on Policy requirements for Directors and Board Office personnel.
Limited Policy awareness or understanding of Policy requirements among Board members.
Lack of a standardized process in place for conducting expense report reviews.
Risks:
Delinquent submission of Expense reports could lead to inaccurate and untimely financial reporting from
misclassification errors (e.g., reimbursements are deemed non-accountable and treated as taxable wages).
Delays in submitting expense reports may hinder operational efficiency and cause delays in both reimbursements and
Board-related activities.
Absence of submission dates may impair the ability to trace and verify timely approvals.
Incorrect mileage allocations distort expense reporting between the Director’s and agency’s accounts.
Incomplete documentation, such as missing receipts or business purpose details, may limit the ability to substantiate
the appropriateness of an expense.
Misclassified expenses in the general ledger may affect the accuracy of financial records and lead to potential
misrepresentation of spending categories.

Observation 2

1.E.1.c

Report No. 2025-05 Board of Directors Expense Reimbursement Review
Internal Audit Report
Issued: October 31, 2025

Recommendation:
Management should consider implementing periodic refresher training for Directors to reinforce awareness of
submission deadlines and reimbursement requirements.
Management and the Board should consider enforcing existing submission deadlines by establishing consequences for
delinquent expense report submission, including the potential denial of reimbursement for reports submitted beyond
the allowable timeframe.
Management should consider developing and implementing standardized review procedures for both the expense
reports and the input into Oracle Expense Reports to ensure expenses are properly supported, amounts are accurate,
and data entry errors are minimized. The review should be conducted by Board Office personnel and not be performed
by delegated Board Office preparer or data entry personnel to ensure segregation of duties.
Management should consider coordinating with IT and Accounting to assess the availability and feasibility of using
Oracle’s import functionality for uploading reviewed and approved expense reports into Oracle to minimize data entry,
the potential for errors and decrease administrative burden.
Management Action Plan:
The Board Office will offer a voluntary refresher training annually for Directors to review existing “how to” materials for
submitting expenses. The Board Office will update training materials regularly to ensure those materials match existing
practices.
The Board Office will work with the Executive Committee and full Board to revise the Board’s Expense and
Reimbursement Policy to:
1. Require explicit approval by the Chief Financial Officer or their designee for expenses submitted more than 30
days after the stated quarterly deadline to ensure compliance with federal tax law, internal control standards,
and sound governance practices.
The Board Office will also add a layer of review of submitted expenses ensuring that all submitted expenses are
reviewed by the Board Operations Manager prior to being reviewed by the Board Office Executive Manager.
The Board Office will coordinate with RTD’s Accounting and Oracle database teams to explore ways to increase
automation in the tracking and approval of expense reimbursements.

Internal Audit Report
Issued: October 31, 2025

Observation Title:
Inconsistent Tracking and Monitoring of Board Expenses

Risk Rating:
Low/Process Improvement

Internal Audit Observation:
The Board Expense Spending Summary excel spreadsheet used to track and monitor Directors’ annual expenditures
limits does not consistently classify expenses in the correct category. In a review of 16 Directors for the 2024 calendar
year, five had inaccurate annual expenditures due to miscategorized expenses. Although no Director exceeded their
annual limit, the manual data entry process has resulted in inconsistent classification, making it difficult to determine
whether individual Directors are remaining within their designated spending thresholds.

Note: Internal Audit did not review or assess the accuracy or completeness of RTD paid expenses noted on the Board
Expense Spending Summary.
Cause:
Spreadsheet relies on manual entry of expenses.
Risks:
Inaccurate tracking and categorization of Director’s expenses may result in incorrect assessment of spending activity
which could lead to the approval or disapproval of expenses or misrepresent whether a Director has remained within
their annual spending limit.
Recommendation:
Management should consider optimizing the use of Oracle by implementing additional accounts to support more
detailed reporting and analysis of Directors’ expenditures. Developing automated Oracle reports to track Director
expenditures would enable more efficient monitoring of annual limits, reduce manual data entry errors and improve
data consistency.
Management Action Plan:
The Board Office will coordinate with RTD’s Accounting and Oracle database teams to explore ways to increase
automation in the tracking and approval of expense reimbursements. Additionally, Board Office staff will work with the
aforementioned teams to ensure appropriate system privileges for Board Office staff.

Observation 3

1.E.1.c

Report No. 2025-05 Board of Directors Expense Reimbursement Review
Internal Audit Report
Issued: October 31, 2025

Observation Title:
Enhance Guidance on Issued and Reimbursed Assets

Risk Rating:
Low/Process Improvement

Internal Audit Observation:
Although the RTD Board of Directors Expense and Reimbursement Policy outlines the allowance and ownership of
equipment issued to or reimbursed for Directors, there is not a formalized process in place to track these assets or
ensure their recovery at the conclusion of a Director’s term. This includes both RTD-owned equipment and items
purchased by Directors and reimbursed by RTD, which are considered RTD property.
Cause:
The process for managing assets reimbursed to Directors is not integrated with RTD’s IT department limiting
oversight and reducing visibility into equipment assigned to Directors.
Risks:
The absence of a consistent and standardized process may lead to inconsistencies in how assets are issued, tracked
and recovered across Directors, potentially resulting in unequal treatment and unclear expectations regarding assetrelated ownership and responsibility.
Inadequate asset tracking may lead to RTD-owned or reimbursed assets not being returned at the end of the
Director’s term, potentially resulting in loss of public property and reputational damage to the agency.
Recommendation:
Management should consider enhancing the Director on-boarding documentation to include a comprehensive listing
of RTD issued assets, along with a mechanism for updating the list throughout the Director’s term to reflect any
reimbursed or newly issued assets. Additionally, the off-boarding process, potentially utilizing the same document,
should include a final review of all assets issued and reimbursed during the Director’s tenure as well as
documentation confirming the return of all RTD property.
Management should consider establishing clear guidelines within the Policy prohibiting the reimbursement for certain
Director purchases (i.e., laptop, monitor(s), mobile device) and clarify which assets that must be returned to RTD at
the end of the Director’s term versus those that may be retained (i.e., webcam, keyboard, mouse).
Management Action Plan:
The Board Office will work with the Executive Committee and full Board to revise the Board’s Expense and
Reimbursement Policy to:
1.
2.
3.
4.

Further clarify the need to return certain RTD purchased IT assets to RTD
Clarify that assets issued by RTD may not be purchased by Directors
Clarify which types of assets do not need to be returned (i.e. mice, keyboards, etc.)
Set the timeline for return of assets and the consequences for failing to return the assets

The Board Office will partner with RTD IT staff to develop a system for logging and tracking auxiliary/peripheral IT
equipment issued to Directors that builds upon the system already in place for tracking phones and laptops issued to
Directors. The goal for which will be to create a standardized form for each Director that lists the assets issued, which
assets need to returned at the end of the Director’s term, and logs the return date of those assets.

Internal Audit Report
Issued: October 31, 2025

Observation Title:
Non-Verifiable Signature Use

Risk Rating:
Low/Process Improvement

Internal Audit Observation:
Signatures on Local and Travel Expense Reports are primarily image files inserted by the Board Office staff, rather than
authenticated electronic or handwritten signatures by the Board member. The image-based signature lacks identifying
information necessary to authenticate the signing party, whether preparer or approver.
Cause:
Board Office personnel applied Director’s signature images when preparing expense reports for the Director.
The Expense report approvals may be obtained by email and the signature image applied to the Expense report by the
Board Office personnel.
Risks:
Image-based signatures limit the ability to verify the identity of the signer, increasing the risk of unauthorized
approvals and lack of accountability.
Unverified signature images may be easily replicated or misused, increasing the potential for fraudulent expense
submission and approvals.
The absence of authenticated signatures limits the reliability of the audit trail, making it challenging to validate the
legitimacy of approvals.
Recommendation:
Management should consider requiring Directors to apply formal electronic signatures to expense reports whether
prepared by Director or the Board Office personnel. The electronic signature tool should generate a unique, verifiable
signature with a timestamp to confirm the timing of submission or approval.
Management should consider updating the Policy to require either original handwritten or authenticated digital
signatures for all submissions and approvals.
Management Action Plan:
The Board Office will create a new expense reimbursement request form utilizing available solutions through Microsoft
365. This expense form can be accessed only by a Director logged into their RTD account and will include a required
authorization box Directors will check authorizing Board Office staff to submit expenses for approval based on the
information provided in the form. That form will then also be routed to the appropriate approval authority for approval
via a similar method.

Report ratings are utilized to communicate the aggregate compliance or risk observed for the in-scope location, process, or system.

Satisfactory

The in-scope areas of the project are generally in compliance with applicable policies and procedures.
The design and effectiveness of internal controls appear to be adequate. Exceptions noted were
isolated and/or minor, and departures from leading practices are minimal (as applicable).

Needs Improvement

The in-scope areas of the project, although generally in compliance with policies and procedures, have
certain deficiencies with the design or effectiveness of internal controls, which should be improved.
Some departures from leading practices have been identified, creating opportunities for process or
efficiency improvement or for improved financial statement accuracy.

Unsatisfactory

The in-scope areas of the project are in substantial non-compliance with policies and procedures, and
the design or effectiveness of internal controls is not adequate. Multiple and/or significant departures
from leading practice may be present, creating operational inefficiency. If such deficiencies are not
corrected, the company can be exposed to loss or financial misstatement.

1.E.1.c

Report No. 2025-05 Board of Directors Expense Reimbursement Review
Internal Audit Report
Issued: October 31, 2025

Risk/Impact: Observation that presents a high risk to the agency and/or is of high importance to business
success/achievement of goals. Conditions exist or situations could occur which could have a significant adverse
impact (i.e., financial, reputational, etc.) on the business. Significant audit observations may include conditions
dealing with irregularities, illegal acts, financial reporting errors, inefficiencies, waste, ineffectiveness, conflicts
of interest, and control weaknesses. In addition, an observation is considered High Priority if a finding creates
a large exposure that could result in a loss of system control, access, application control, and/or exposure of
data via the compromise of administrative accounts and/or other system functions. It could also create an
exposure of confidentiality or integrity.

High Priority

The relevant risks associated with the observation may be considered high due to one or more of the following
conditions:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Significant financial impact for location/site audited
Prevalence of issues or exceptions
Circumvention of controls, Management wrong-doing and/or willful disregard of company policy or
regulatory requirements
Non-compliance with US/Local laws or regulations
Disruption to operations and/or significant reputational exposures
Unremediated previously identified control observations or a history of similar issues, although minor,
may be considered a high priority classification.

Urgency of Action Plan: Corrective action is required within three months, or other time period deemed
reasonable by both Management and Internal Audit.

Moderate
Priority

Risk/Impact: The observation in the report relates to ineffective or insufficient controls to manage key
business risks. The risks associated could lead to financial statement errors and losses, operational
inefficiencies (including financial system and IT issues) or result in instances of policy and regulatory
non-compliance as well as potential reputational damages, fines, and penalties.
Urgency of Action Plan: Corrective actions should be implemented within the next six months, or other time
period deemed reasonable by both Management and Internal Audit.

Low Priority/
Process
Improvement

Risk/Impact: Other findings were identified during fieldwork that are isolated or minor control gaps for
business cycles not in-scope for the audit, observations to improve financial and/or operational efficiency, or
are designed to assist management in improving the operating capacity of the department and/or activity.
These recommendations do not impact on the overall rating.
Urgency of Action Plan: While not necessarily a priority, corrective action should occur within the next
12 months.
