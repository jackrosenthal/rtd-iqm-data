Chair Hoy stated public participation was open to anyone who wanted to address the Board.  He said speakers would be be called in the order that they signed up. He reminded the audience that each speaker is allowed three minutes.

Kevin Flynn, Denver City Council, 4981 South Garland Street Denver, stated that he appreciates the work and the challenges that the Board and RTD faces.  Mr. Flynn stated that he came to address a service change with the C and D Line.  He commented that he routinely uses transit and addresses the D Line ridership has decreased almost 20%, though there are still more D Line riders than the C line and this service change may erode the D Line ridership.  He asked that the Board consider this impact with the decision to make this change.

Joan Peck, City of Longmont, provided two letters one from the Longmont Economic Development Partnership and from the Longmont Chamber of Commerce, that support the State Highway 119 (SH 119) Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) project. She stated it was encouraging that CU Leeds offered better revenue predictions for RTD, but frustrating that the Board has decided to push the timeline for the SH 119 project back one year.  As an elected official representing Longmont she said she worked to receive Volkswagen settlement funds for electric busses along the SH 119 in order to save RTD dollars in the project, and was concerned that the 16th Street Mall and its new buses would be the recipient of those funds. She stated that Longmont was advocating heavily that the timeline of 2022 for the SH 119 BRT project to be put back on the agenda with a revote by the RTD Board.  She noted that Longmont was experiencing rapid growth and that she believed maintaining the timeline would help leverage over $100 million in CDOT funding currently planned for the corridor.  Ms. Peck stated that Longmont officials and citizens feel that the RTD Board of Directors continued to push this project back because the directors lived in the southern parts of the district.  Ms. Peck respectfully requested that the RTD Board rethink priorities and to be the board that would finish the FasTracks program within the next 12-15 years.

Mac Callison, Planning Supervisor, City of Aurora, spoke on behalf of Mayor Hogan regarding the modification to the R Line and bus routes proposed on October 17, 2017. Mr. Callison explained that Aurora had a number of developments progressing along the R Line and requested RTD to draw riders through marketing, rather than cut service. Mr. Callison stated that RTD needed to add creative marketing, convenient schedules, and other innovative measures to increase ridership, and that Aurora was ready to support these measures.  He concluded that in order to realize the full potential of the R Line, Aurora and RTD needed to work together.

George Gerstle, Commuting Solutions Chairperson, offered thanks and acknowledgment from Boulder County, the US 36 Mayors and Commissioners Coalition, and Commuting Solutions for keeping the SH 119 BRT in the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP). Mr. Gerstle commented that by keeping the funding for this project, which is a high priority in the Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS), allows partnering with CDOT and utilizing federal funds to leverage the RTD funds.

Chris Sorauf, 6127 Holmes St., Arvada, stated that the line is 46 weeks behind schedule and without a date for opening.  Mr. Sorauf questioned if the wireless technology is the issue, and if it was too late to change to a more conventional system. He voiced concern about tax dollars that are spent and hopes to hear a date for testing in the near future.

David Rothenberger, 1310 Garrison St., Denver, expressed concerns regarding the graffiti issues along the W Line. He noted that there was a policy that stated that graffiti would be cleaned up within 24 hours after being reported and that policy is not being adhered to.

JM Fay, no address given, questioned why there is a lock being placed on electrical outlets, why there are still busses being used when there are trains to use in the same routes, why are the connections so poor from the R Line to other trains, what are you doing with the R Line and the service to it, and lastly has a parking fee been considered rather than raising local fares.

Paul Sorazano, 84B Nome Way, Aurora, expressed concerns regarding the deterioration and unreliability of RTD service. Mr. Sorazano stated that customer service responses are not providing any assistance as to tracking routes or planning a route. In regards to fares he requested that RTD make it available to pay up for a day pass as welfare programs provide.  Lastly, Mr. Sorazano commented that there are not enough accommodations for bikes.

Rosemary Paolillo, 3347 S. Helena St., Aurora, and a former RTD Director District F stated her concern about the R Line schedule revision, and said that the time that it had been operating had not been long enough to determine ridership.

October 11th the FRA granted permission to complete testing on the G Line.  The PUC process is still being worked through, RTD was on the September 27th docket to have the PUC approve the three A Line crossings, B Line crossings and all crossings along the G Line these requests were verbally denied.  General Manager Genova stated that RTD is waiting for written orders from the PUC to move through certifying the crossings, and until we know this process we are unable to resume testing on the G Line and determine a time frame on testing or opening.

Director Francone commented on the PUC delayed too long to issue a written report and that RTD and the City of Arvada deserved a response.

Director Archuleta asked what the union is asking for in their agreement.

General Manager Genova explained that he could not legally discuss specific requests in a public and open forum.  He offered that there are a variety of items that include wages, hours, percentages of split shift, recovery time, better use of restrooms, and quality of life issues.  He said RTD proposed some incentives and wage increases that address many of these issues.

##### a. Exhibit I - 2017 Long Range Plan Cash Flow

Motion:               Director Anderson made the motion to approve the January 2018 Service Change.

Director Folska seconded the motion.

Discussion:               Director Menten will be voting no to support the original recommendations from staff for the reduction in service for both the R and the W Line, rather than this revised proposal.

Director Solano stated that he would vote no because the R Line has not been given enough time to determine ridership and for our venerable population that rely on this transit.

Director Folska stated she would vote yes to support the changes which will increase the ridership. Director Folska commended the staff on taking in consideration stakeholders and the community to amend the service change, and giving the area a chance to grow the ridership. She reminded those present that all of our districts and all need to work together in order to grow our ridership.

Director Mihalik commented that the R Line should not be exempt to the next service change review.

Director Francone thanked the staff for their work however, she cannot support this motion because we cannot run empty trains waiting for future ridership to increase. The service should change according to ridership and can always be adjusted based on the four times a year that ridership is analyzed.

Director Walker will vote yes because it appears the constituents are attempting to improve the ridership. He offered thanks to Flynn for comments and acknowledges that there will be riders impacted from the service change.

Director Tisdale seconds. Director Mihalik’s comments regarding continued review and calls upon the City of Aurora to promote the R line and collaborate with RTD.  He addresses the letter provided by Mayor Hogan which suggested that the burden of improving ridership is placed on RTD, and that it is far more effective for the city to market the ridership.

Director Anderson agreed with Directors Tisdale and Mihalik, to give the Lines a chance.

Director Sisk suggested that a no vote could put this agency in peril as it would continue the current service, and this agency cannot afford to run this line as it is. He is therefore voting yes, and recommends others to think about there no vote.

Director Lubow will vote yes, regardless of the reduction of service quickly but agrees that this will protect the agencies financial investments.

Director Williams reminded all present that we are in the business of moving people, not trains or busses or vehicles.

Director Broom voting no because this has not been enough time to gage the effectiveness of a line before making changes to the service.

Director Deadwyler explained that she will vote yes because this line is important.  She stated that the amended proposal is a good compromise and that it gives the line time to improve until the next evaluation.

Chair Hoy encouraged anyone to add comments now.

Chair Hoy states that this is a perplexing vote as some directors don’t believe it is enough of a cut, a cut is a cut, to not pass this, is surprising because those that want to cut the service should cut the service. Chair Hoy addresses the City of Aurora, referring to the letter that states that RTD needs to improve marketing and take the lead in attracting riders. Chair states that Aurora should take the lead and RTD will stand behind them, he invites the mayor to contact him directly.

Vote on
