Light

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorizes the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into a contract with Siemens to purchase an
additional seventeen (17) Light Rail Vehicles and spare parts, at a cost not too exceed $64.5 million.
BACKGROUND
At the November 25, 2014 board meeting, the RTD Board authorized staff to begin negotiations with
Siemens to purchase twelve (12) expansion Light Rail Vehicles at a cost not too exceed $48million.
The vehicle specification was being reviewed and updated in the spring of 2015. The number of
additional LRV’s has increased by seventeen (17) due to the increased level of ridership demands
(cars added to existing consists) and the additional I-225/SE corridor extensions. Based on ongoing
correspondence with Siemens, we are negotiating a price for twenty-nine (29) vehicles at less than
$4million per vehicle which is much better than the original price point at twelve (12) vehicles. RTD
can realize a significant savings which would be in the best interest of the District.
DISCUSSION
The RTD Capitol Planning Team has analyzed and re-evaluated the current and future projections of
the Light Rail fleet demand. The evaluation has determined a reduction in the spare ratio to 5% in Q4
of 2017 with the existing fleet and initial vehicle deliveries. The requested additional vehicles will
return the fleet to a 17% spare ratio by Q4 of 2018. This is short of the industry standard spare ratio
of 20%. In support of the Board adopted strategic goal of Innovative and Fiscally Sustainable Service
Delivery, including Asset Management/State of Good Repair, Rail Operations requests to purchase a
total of twenty-nine (29) expansion Light Rail Vehicles in order to continue to provide the proper level
of service. Furthermore, adding these cars will provide the required number of spare vehicles needed
to properly maintain the existing fleet as it ages and preserves our service within the board-approved
service standards. Without the additional vehicles, RTD may be forced to open the new extensions
with lower service than has been projected. Each vehicle takes two (2) years to manufacture.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
This acquisition is part of the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) that was recently approved by the RTD
Board on August 18th, 2015. Funds are budgeted in years 2015 thru 2018. The funding for the
vehicles will be financed through the issuance of Certificates of Participation (COPS) that was
approved by the RTD Board in the July 28th, 2015 meeting. The COPS funding has been secured on
August 20th, 2015. Two (2) vehicles will be funded through Fastracks that has been recently
approved in the Annual Program Evaluations (APE). The remaining vehicles are funded through the
base system. Based on ongoing correspondence with Siemens, we are negotiating a price for twentynine (29) vehicles at less than $4million for each vehicle. RTD has included in this request the related
expenses, spare parts and a “Buy- America” audit, with on-site factory inspections during the vehicle
construction.

1.B.1

DBE PARTICIPATION
There is no DBE requirement for transit vehicle purchases. Each vehicle manufacturer is required by the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to submit a DBE plan for FTA approval. As part of the required
proposal submittal documents, Siemens has submitted a certificate attesting to FTA’s approval of its
DBE plan.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to finalize negotiations with Siemens to
execute a contract to purchase an additional seventeen (17) Light Rail vehicles in an amount
not to exceed the amount programmed in the SBP which is $64.5 million. This is the
recommended alternative.
2. Do not allow the General Manager to finalize negotiations with Siemens for the purchase of an
additional seventeen (17) Light Rail vehicles. This will delay the procurement process and
present a challenge to maintain the fleet, which is not in the best interest of the District.

Recommended EcoPass Pricing for 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
approves an 18.3 percent price increase for Business EcoPass and a 13.3 percent price increase for
Neighborhood EcoPass. These price increases are for 2016 contracts. In addition, it is recommended
that the current $2.50 DIA surcharge be eliminated for both the Business EcoPass and Neighborhood
EcoPass programs.
BACKGROUND
RTD staff has been working on an extensive Fare Study for the past year. The objective of the Fare
Study was to determine how to simplify RTD’s fare policies in an equitable and cost-effective manner to
better meet the needs of the District and its customers moving forward. In May 2015, the RTD Board of
Directors approved new fare policies that will go into effect on January 1, 2016. The new fare policies
adopted by the Board did not include any changes for pass program pricing.
The results of the Title VI equity analysis conducted as part of the May actions indicated that there were
Title VI concerns with the Business EcoPass program. Increases to Business and Neighborhood EcoPass
programs were not included in the recommendations that were adopted by the Board in May but staff
did communicate that commensurate price increases in the pass programs were assumed in the financial
projections and additional recommendations would be forthcoming.
Key members of the RTD Fare Study Task Force including several members of the Senior Leadership
Team began working closely with the Title VI Manager and General Counsel in May to better understand
the Title VI concerns related to the Business EcoPass program. This equity analysis suggested that
Business EcoPass riders are more likely to be non-minority or non-low income individuals than the RTD
ridership as a whole. In addition, the average per trip fare revenue generated from Business EcoPass was
less than the average fare paid by RTD passengers in general.
Therefore, the working group established the goal of developing a recommendation for Business EcoPass
pricing that would equalize the average fare paid among EcoPass riders and general RTD riders.
DISCUSSION
Staff described their current thinking to the Board in August which included a recommendation to
increase 2016 Business EcoPass contracts by 18.3 percent and Neighborhood EcoPass contracts by
14.4 percent. These price increases would result in EcoPass passengers having an average fare revenue
that was in line with the overall system average fare.
In addition, staff indicated that per the approach used to arrive at those increase levels it would make
sense to update the 2009 Board Policy for utilization based pricing of EcoPass with smart card data. The
2009 Board Policy is included as Attachment A. Per the methodology used to determine the percent

Packet Pg. 6

1.B.2

increase necessary to arrive at an average fare for EcoPass equal to the overall average fare, staff was
thinking that the 40 percent discount in the 2009 policy should be updated to 30 percent.
Staff then shared their thinking with stakeholders in advance of developing these final recommendations.
Many of the comments were focused on stakeholders feeling left out of the process. In addition, several
comments were provided that indicated there were other methods for analyzing pass program pricing
and how the increases should be related to the general fare increase.
Stakeholder feedback was considered in developing this final recommendation that includes an 18.3
percent price increase for Business EcoPass for 2016 contract and a 13.3 percent price increase for
neighborhood EcoPass. These increases will result in a projected average fare for Business EcoPass trips
that is equal to the average fare for all RTD passengers and will increase Neighborhood EcoPass pricing
in line with the overall fare increase adopted by the Board in May as Neighborhood EcoPass pricing was
not identified as having a current Title VI concern.
This recommendation does not include any changes to the 2009 Board Policy for future utilization based
pricing as staff is recommending that a 2016 Pass Program Working group be established. This working
group will include RTD staff as well as stakeholders from across the District. The working group will
define goals for pass programs as well as reevaluate the 2009 Board policy for utilization based pricing
to incorporate the new fare structure and average fare analysis once smart card tap data is available. In
addition, it is recommended that this group work closely with the Affordable Fares Task Force to better
understand the relationship between pass programs and the desire for more affordable income based
fares.
One of the concerns that we heard from stakeholders was that an 18.3 percent increase is a large
increase when the contracts are paid in full at the beginning of the year. To help alleviate these concerns
staff will introduce two new contract payment options that will give the businesses flexibility for making
payments over the course of the year. Businesses will be able to pay quarterly with the addition of a 1
percent administrative fee or pay semiannually with no additional fees.
Stakeholders also expressed concerns about the Neighborhood EcoPass prices increasing more than the
general fare increase. As noted above, since the original equity analysis did not identify concerns with
the Neighborhood EcoPass program, staff is recommending that the Neighborhood EcoPass contracts for
2016 be increased by the same percent as the general fare increase (13.3 percent). The new contract
payment options will also apply to Neighborhood EcoPass contracts.
As required by FTA for all fare changes, a Title VI equity analysis has been completed for the
recommendations included in this Board report. With the 18.3 percent increase for Business EcoPass and
the 13.3 percent increase for Neighborhood EcoPass, no Title VI equity concerns were found with the
recommended changes per the RTD Board adopted Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden Policy.
The equity analysis will be submitted to FTA.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The fare policies adopted in May were forecast to generate enough revenue to meet the $131.3 million
revenue target identified for 2016 in the Board adopted Strategic Budget Plan (SBP). Those revenue
forecasts included price increases for both the Business and Neighborhood EcoPass programs consistent
with the general fare increase. The current recommendation for Business EcoPass is to increase 2016
contracts by 18.3 percent instead of 13.3 percent. This additional increase in EcoPass pricing is
anticipated to generate approximately $1 million in additional farebox revenue.

ALTERNATIVES
1) Adopt an 18.3 percent price increase for Business EcoPass and a 13.3 percent price increase for
Neighborhood EcoPass for 2016 contracts. Eliminate the current $2.50 DIA surcharge from both the
Business and Neighborhood EcoPass programs. This is the recommended alternative.
2) Adopt an 18.3 percent price increase for Business EcoPass but phase it in over two years with a
13.3 percent price increase for 2016 contracts and an additional 4.4 percent price increase for 2017
contracts. Adopt a 13.3 percent price increase for Neighborhood EcoPass contracts all to be applied
in 2016. Eliminate the current $2.50 DIA surcharge from both the Business and Neighborhood
EcoPass programs. This is not recommended because it does not immediately address the Title VI
concerns regarding Business EcoPass passengers being more heavily subsidized than RTD riders in
general.
3) Adopt a 13.3 percent price increase for both Business and Neighborhood EcoPass for 2016
contracts. Eliminate the current $2.50 DIA surcharge from both the Business and Neighborhood
EcoPass programs. This is not recommended because it does not address the Title VI concerns
regarding Business EcoPass passengers being more heavily subsidized than RTD riders in general.

DISCUSSION

INFO

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that the RTD Board accept the
recommendations of the RTD Pass Committee for pricing of the Eco Pass and Neighborhood Pass
programs as outlined in Attachments A and B, to be implemented following the availability of
utilization data from smart cards. In addition, lift the current moratorium on new and expanded
contracts in the Neighborhood Pass program as described in Attachment B.
BACKGROUND
The RTD Pass Program Committee began meeting in May 2009. The purpose of the committee was
to develop viable pricing formulas for RTD Eco Pass and Neighborhood pass programs to be used at
such time as smart card data is available to provide actual utilization data. The committee was
comprised of four members of the RTD Board and four external representatives. The committee
met six times, with the last meeting held on September 30.
A joint staff working group, comprised of representatives from RTD, the city of Boulder, Boulder
County and the University of Colorado, was charged with developing a proposed pricing structure
for the business Eco Pass and the Neighborhood Pass programs that could be forwarded to the
Pass Program Committee for consideration.
DISCUSSION
The joint staff working group met a number of times to discuss the factors that should be
considered in pricing unlimited access pass programs as well as the appropriate level of discount
within RTD’s overall fare structure. After considerable discussion, the group developed a set of
recommendations for both the business Eco Pass and the Neighborhood Pass. Those
recommendations were forwarded to the Pass Program Committee and were endorsed by that
committee. The key recommendations for each program are outlined in Attachments A and B, along
with summaries of the key similarities and differences from the current pricing structure.

The financial impact of the proposed changes to pricing formulas for Eco Pass and Neighborhood
Pass will not be known until such time as utilization data from smart cards are available and used
for pricing the programs. In general, the pricing formulas as proposed will for the first time be
based on the value of service used by pass holders.

1.B.2.a

This proposed pricing structure as recommended by the RTD Pass Program Committee is consistent with
the two primary philosophies of the Eco Pass Program established by the committee: 1) that it is
financially sustainable to RTD, and 2) that it serves to increase transit ridership.
The pricing model proposed is a revenue based approach that used RTD’s existing fare structure and the
levels of discounts available through various fare media as the basis upon which the unlimited access
pass programs could be priced. The availability of ridership data through the use of smart cards will, for
the first time, give RTD the opportunity to price the Eco Pass Program based on actual ridership data.
A summary of the key recommendations and a broad overview of the primary similarities and
differences of the existing and proposed Eco Pass pricing structures are outlined below.
Key Recommendations
•
•
•

•

•

•
•

No changes to the Eco Pass pricing structure would be implemented until after adequate smart
card ridership data are available, unless there is a general RTD fare increase.
Continue to use the four current services level areas (SLA’s) as part of the pricing structure, but
use four levels of employer size (1-24, 25-99, 100-499 and 500+).
Continue to use a matrix of employer size and SLA to determine price. The value of trips taken
by all companies within a cell of the matrix will be used to determine the price for that cell. A 40
percent discount will be applied to the cash value of those trips which will be divided by the
total number of employees within that cell to determine a per employee price. This pricing
approach will be revisited for possible adjustments after three full years of smart card data are
available.
During the first two years of the new pricing structure, no company’s contract amount will
increase by more than 10 percent, unless there is a general fare increase. This limit does not
apply to contract minimums.
Contract minimums will use a blended rate that will use actual ridership data by service type
within an SLA to compute the cost of a hypothetical annual pass that reflects the actual
proportions of local, express and regional use. The contract minimum would be twice that
blended cost.
The $5 surcharge for trips to DIA will be eliminated when the new pricing structure is
implemented.
When the new pricing structure is implemented, call-n-Ride service areas will revert to SLA A,
except in cases where the 25+ trip threshold is met.

1.B.2.a

Differences
• The existing pricing structure was developed in 1990 and was based on company location,
company size and estimated ridership. The proposed pricing structure will still use company
location and size, but will use smart card data to determine actual ridership and the value of
trips taken.
• The existing structure uses a pricing matrix that has 20 cells, representing four SLA’s and five
different ranges of company size. The proposed structure will still use four SLAs but will have
only four different ranges of company size.
• The proposed structure will use actual utilization data to determine the value of trips taken by
all employees of companies within a pricing cell. A 40% discount would then be applied to the
cash fare value of those trips. The result will then be divided by the total number of employees
in that pricing cell to determine the following year’s per employee rate. The 40% discount rate is
in line with discounts offered through other RTD pass products and reflects the benefits that
accrue to RTD from the Eco Pass Program.
• The current contract minimums are approximately the cost of one annual pass for local, express
or regional fares, depending on SLA. The proposed contract minimum will use a blended rate
that will use actual ridership data by service type within an SLA to compute the cost of a
hypothetical annual pass that reflects the actual proportions of local, express and regional use.
The contract minimum would be twice that blended cost.

Packet Pg. 12

Attachment: RTD Pass Program Attachment A (2523 : Recommended EcoPass Pricing for 2016)

Similarities
• Both the existing and proposed pricing structures use the underlying premise that all employees
within a company are paid for and all are eligible to receive an Eco Pass.
• Both pricing structures use the size of the employer and the employer’s location (called Service
Level Areas or SLAs) to determine pricing level.
• Both pricing structures have contract minimums.

This proposed pricing structure as recommended by the RTD Pass Program Committee is consistent with
the two primary philosophies of the Neighborhood Eco Pass Program established by the committee: 1)
that it is financially sustainable to RTD, and 2) that it serves to increase transit ridership.
The pricing model proposed is a revenue based approach that used RTD’s existing fare structure and the
levels of discounts available through various fare media as the basis upon which the unlimited access
pass programs could be priced. The availability of ridership data through the use of smart cards will, for
the first time, give RTD the opportunity to price the Neighborhood Eco Pass Program based on actual
ridership data.
A summary of the key recommendations and a broad overview of the primary similarities and
differences of the existing and proposed Neighborhood Eco Pass pricing structures are outlined below.
Key Recommendations
•

•
•

•

•

•
•
•

For neighborhoods currently participating in the program, no changes to the Neighborhood Eco
Pass pricing structure would be implemented until after adequate smart card ridership data are
available, unless there is a general RTD fare increase.
Neighborhoods will continue to be defined by contiguous blocks as the basis for pricing.
The value of trips taken by all residents within a contractually defined neighborhood will be
used as the basis to determine the following year’s price for that neighborhood. A 40 percent
discount will be applied to the cash value of those trips which will be divided by the total
number of households within that neighborhood to determine the per household price. This
pricing approach will be revisited for possible adjustments after three full years of smart card
data are available.
During the first two years of the new pricing structure, any increase to a neighborhood’s
contract price will be by no more than 33 percent of the difference between the smart card
calculated price and the pre smart card price, unless there is a general fare increase.
Contract minimums for each neighborhood will be set at $5,000 and a minimum of 40
households. Any existing neighborhood with less than 40 households will be grandfathered from
this requirement.
The $5 surcharge for trips to DIA will be eliminated when the new pricing structure is
implemented.
Prices for new neighborhood wishing to enter the program will be based a survey of existing
ridership patterns. The survey may be calibrated over time as smart card data are available.
Lift the moratorium on new or expanding neighborhoods in recognition of a $10,000 financial
contribution from the city of Boulder and the fact that smart card data will be available in future

Similarities
• Both the existing and proposed pricing structures use the underlying premise that all residences
within a geographically defined neighborhood are paid for and all are eligible to receive a
Neighborhood Eco Pass.
• Under both the existing and proposed pricing structures, survey results will be used to establish
the first year price for a new neighborhood joining the program.
• Both pricing structures have contract minimums.
Differences
• The existing pricing structure within the city of Boulder was developed in 1999 and was based
on travel diary information. The proposed pricing structure will use smart card data to
determine actual ridership and the value of trips taken, apply a 40 percent discount to that
amount, then divide by the number of households in the neighborhood to determine the per
household rate. The 40% discount rate is in line with discounts offered through other RTD pass
products and reflects the benefits that accrue to RTD from the Eco Pass Program.
• The current contract minimums are $5,600 per neighborhood. The new contract minimums for
each neighborhood will be set at $5,000 and a minimum of 40 households. Any existing
neighborhood with less than 40 households will be grandfathered from this requirement.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, Interim General Manager and
CEO

Date: September 3, 2015

From:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

September 3, 2015

Board Meeting Date: September 8, 2015

Subject:

January 2016 Service Changes

RECOMMENDED ACTION
No action required, for information only.
DISCUSSION
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. We will continue adjusting services in
response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. It is also
our responsibility to identify services that are underperforming and recommend modifications,
curtailment or cancellation of service as warranted. The proposals herein include a mix of service
enhancements, system maintenance actions and several service reductions. The proposals are offered in
parallel with the Board approved US 36 BRT Service Plan and would be implemented on the same date.
We will monitor customer response to the implementation of these service changes and propose
adjustments as appropriate in future service change recommendation.
The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
 Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
 Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
SUMMARY OF PROPOSED SERVICE CHANGES

Route 3 – Alameda Avenue
This proposal discontinues the deviation into the Havana & Alameda Park-n-Ride.
Passengers may instead use stops on Alameda, approximately 300 feet away. Saves 3-4
minutes in each direction for through passengers. It is also proposed to provide more direct
routing through Cherry Creek by operating on Bayaud Avenue between Steele Street and
Colorado Blvd., instead of the indirect routing via Ellsworth, Madison, and Bayaud. This
routing provides convenient access for neighborhood residents, as well as more direct and
faster service for through passengers. No cost impacts are anticipated.
Route 3L – East Alameda Limited
Schedule adjustments. No cost impacts are anticipated
Route 8 – North Broadway/Huron
It is proposed to extend this route to 144th and Huron at 60 min frequency, all day in
order to provide fixed route service to the Orchards Mall development. In addition, it is
proposed to remove the current ‘selected trips’ from the 124thand Peoria loop and to
operate all trips after Wagon Road Park-n-Ride on Huron. Trips would no longer enter the
Park-n-Ride, but provide connections on-street at Huron and 120th Avenue. Cost impacts
anticipated to be an estimated $165,000 annualized.
Route 11 – Mississippi Avenue
Discontinue deviation via Cherry Street and Cherry Creek Drive South, north of Mississippi
in Glendale. Most passengers boardings are within 500 feet of Mississippi, others may
use Route 46. Saves approximately 3 minutes in each direction for through passengers.
Reroute via Blackhawk Street instead of Abilene between Mississippi and Exposition
Avenues in Aurora. More conveniently serves the overall residential and commercial
development in this area.
Route 15 – East Colfax
New recovery location at 11th/Larimer requires revision to the exit from the Auraria
Campus. New routing will be 11th Street, R-Auraria Pkwy, C-Market St, R-17th St, to
regular route. No cost impacts are anticipated.
Route 16 – West Colfax
It is proposed to discontinue evening and late night short-turn trips between Civic Center
Station and Decatur-Federal Station. Anticipated cost savings is estimated to be $63,000
annualized.
Route 20 – 20th Avenue
New eastbound time point at 17th/Larimer. No cost impacts are anticipated.
Route 21 – Evans Avenue
Late evening schedule adjustments for recovery distribution. No cost impacts are
anticipated.

Route 31 – Federal Boulevard & Route 30 – South Federal
To improve on time performance on weekends, it is proposed to add an additional bus to
the cycle on both Saturday and Sunday. Minor schedule adjustments are also proposed for
weekday. Anticipated cost is $44,000 annualized.
Route 32 – 32nd Avenue
Extend Saturday/Sunday/holiday service from downtown Denver, east to Colorado Blvd.
with new recovery location facing westbound at 22nd Ave./Colorado. Reestablishes
weekend service to the Denver Zoo. No cost impacts are anticipated, due to using present
recovery time at Civic Center Station.
Route 33 – Platte Valley
Minor schedule adjustments are proposed. No cost impacts are anticipated.
Route 38 – 38th Avenue
Minor schedules adjustments are proposed. No cost impacts are anticipated.
Route 44 – 44th Avenue
Minor schedules adjustments are proposed. No cost impacts are anticipated.
Route 51 – Sheridan Boulevard
Minor schedule adjustments are proposed to improve on-time performance. No cost
impacts are anticipated.
Route 79Ltd – South Quebec Way Limited, becomes Route 83D
Rename Route 79L as Route 83D, and fully integrate schedule with Route 83L.
The following changes are designed to extend the period of 15 minute frequency along
Leetsdale and through Cherry Creek by one hour at the end of the AM peak, and by one
hour eastbound at the beginning of the PM peak.
- Convert existing westbound Route 83L trip at 8:39am to a Route 83D (79L) trip.
- Add late AM peak westbound trips from Nine Mile Station at 9:09am and 9:39am.
- Add new midafternoon eastbound trips from Civic Center Station at 1:16pm and
1:46pm.
With these additions the 15 minute trunk frequency on Leetsdale/1st/Speer would then
operate until 10:45am westbound arriving Civic Center Station, and would begin at
1:00pm eastbound departing Civic Center Station. Current Route 83L midday productivity
is 65.0 boardings/hour. .
On Saturdays during the period of 15 minute frequency on Route 83L, approximately
10:00am to 6:00pm, reroute one trip per hour as Route 83D, providing Saturday service

Reroute Route 28 onto 26th Avenue between Lowell Blvd and Clay St. Reroute Route 28B
to remain on 26th Avenue between Quitman St and Lowell Blvd. Route 28B to continue
service on Lowell Blvd and 29th Ave. Minor schedule adjustments are proposed.
No cost impacts are anticipated.

1.C.1.a

Route 83L – Parker/Leetsdale
Add 7:40am westbound trip on Saturday/Sunday/holidays, relieving overloads on existing
7:25am westbound trip.
Cost impacts are anticipated to be an estimated $6,000 annualized.
Route 92 – 92nd Ave Crosstown
Schedule adjustments to improve on-time performance. No cost impacts are anticipated.
Route 100 – Kipling Street
Weekday minor schedule adjustments are proposed to improve on-time performance. No
cost impacts are anticipated.
Route 104X – Commerce City/Denver Express
Grant funding for this route expires as of January 16, 2016. It is proposed to incorporate
this route into the regular RTD services since ridership warrants its continuation, as per
RTD Service Standards. Hourly ridership for this service averages 24 passengers per inservice hour. However, the last trip in the northbound direction averages 5 passengers per
trip and so it is recommended that this trip be discontinued. Cost impacts are estimated to
be $140,700 annualized.
145X – Brighton/DIA Express
It is proposed to shift the current 2:45pm northbound trip to 3:00pm, from Denver
International Airport, in order to better match work shift end times for DIA employees. No
cost impacts are anticipated.
Route 169L – Buckley/Tower/DIA
Running time adjustments. No cost impacts are anticipated.
Route 206 – Pearl/ Manhattan/Fairview High School
Discontinue the route segment between Boulder Junction at Depot Square (BJDS) and
Boulder Transit Center due to low ridership averaging 8 passengers per service hour or
1.5 passengers per trip and duplicative service provided by Routes 205 and HOP.
Increase the frequency between BJDS and Flatiron Business Park to 15 minutes in the
peaks with a timed connection with Route BJCC. Boulder Junction at Depot Square will
be the new western terminal for this route. This is part of the recently revised Boulder
Transportation Master Plan. No cost impacts are anticipated.
Route 323 – Skyline Crosstown
Due to the reconstruction and re-opening of Twin Peaks Mall, it is proposed to adjust
Route 323 to serve the location along Hover, between Nelson Rd and Diagonal Highway
119, similar to its former routing. This would result in the discontinuation of routing along
Diagonal Highway 119 between Hover and Nelson Rd, as well as along Nelson Rd
between Diagonal Highway 119 and Hover. This re-route comes at the request of the City
of Longmont in order for the route to better serve the reconstructed Mall directly. Average

along South Quebec Way and South Dayton. Cost impacts are anticipated to be an
estimated $60,000 annualized.

1.C.1.a

Route AB – Boulder/Denver Airport (DIA)
Add one AM eastbound trip at 5:30am to address current overloads. Anticipated cost is
estimated to be $23,000 annualized.
Route BOLT – Boulder/Longmont
It is proposed to discontinue the Monarch Business Park loop due to ridership averaging 56 boardings per day, or 0.75 boardings per trip serving this location. No cost savings
realized, due to current buy up agreement; saved running time on Monarch Loop will allow
for better on-time performance and balanced layover/recovery
Route DASH – Boulder/Lafayette Via Louisville
This proposal discontinues the Sunday interline to the Route JUMP in an effort to improve
on-time performance. Cost impacts anticipated to be $39,000 annualized.
Route J – Longmont/Gunbarrel/Boulder
It is proposed to discontinue route J south of Euclid/18th Street due to ridership on this
segment of the route averaging 15 boardings per day and duplication of local service via
Routes DASH, SKIP and 204. It is also proposed to discontinue the current 6:03pm
northbound trip due to ridership averaging only 9 passengers. Cost savings are estimated
to be $11,000 annualized.
Route L – Longmont/Denver
Boulder County and City of Longmont have been awarded grant funding for additional
weekday mid-day service, as well as Saturday service and new Sunday/Holiday service. It
is proposed to increase the weekday mid-day service to hourly frequency and extend the
service span to 10pm, northbound. In addition, Saturday hourly service frequency span is
proposed to be extended from approximately 9am to 10pm and Sunday hourly service
frequency to be added from 9am to 10pm, matching Saturday service levels and
frequency. The anticipated cost impact is $140,000 annualized funded through a CMAQ
grant sponsored by Boulder County.

daily Ridership affected: 26 passenger or 2 passengers per trip. No cost impacts are
anticipated.

1.C.1.a

E Line
It is proposed to add one train in the operations (total of seven trains) to complete the transition
to a full 15-minute headway in the AM and PM peak periods. Southbound trips from Denver
Union Station would be added at 6:58 AM, 8:13 AM, 3:58 PM, 5:28 PM, and 5:58 PM.
Northbound trips from Lincoln Station would be added at 6:24 AM, 7:54 AM, 3:39 PM, and 4:39
PM. This increase in service will help with transfers to/from the new Flatiron Flyer and new
commuter rail lines opening later in the year in addition to transfers to/from existing routes such
as the W Line. Additionally, it helps increase capacity on RTD’s fastest-growing light rail line
(11% ridership increase between 2013-2014) and provides an alternative service to the F Line
and H Line, the latter which is near capacity during the peak hour. Additionally, it is proposed to
adjust evening trips (between 6-8 PM) by 15 minutes southbound from Denver Union Station to
create a more balanced schedule along with the C Line, similar to the midday schedule.
Total hours required: 9:23 hours daily (Mondays-Thursdays and Fridays), 2,391 annual hours.
Cost impacts are anticipated to be approximately $283,000 annualized.
W Line
It is proposed to adjust times slightly to space trains better at Denver Union Station (most
westbound trains would depart one minute earlier) and adjust the time by about one minute for
eastbound trains arriving at Auraria West Station. No cost impacts anticipated.

Call-nRide
Golden Call-n-Ride
The Golden Call-n-Ride began operating in April 2013 with the opening of the West Line
under a Congestion Mitigation Air Quality Improvement Grant (CMAQ) sponsored by the
City of Golden, the Colorado School of Mines and the RTD. The RTD contributes 50% of
the local match contributed towards the grant. The Call-n-Ride operates one vehicle as a
Flex Route and two vehicles as a non-flex route Call-n-Ride on weekdays. The Call-n-Ride
operates Monday-Friday 5:30am – 8:00pm and Saturdays 8:00am – 7:00pm. On
Saturday, the Call-n-Ride operates one vehicle as a Call-n-Ride. This recommendation is to
add an additional 3.5 hours service on the weekday service. Weekday service is currently
at 7.4 boardings per hour. This additional service will provide additional am service to the
Call-n-Ride to meet customer’s service demand. Cost impact is anticipated to be an
estimated $28,789 annualized.

ADA Expert Mid-Year Report

As required by the Settlement Agreement between RTD and the Colorado Cross Disability Coalition
(CCDC), RTD retained the services of an “ADA Expert” to “review, audit, and prepare a written report
(“Initial Expert Report”) to ensure that RTD implements and enforces the policy required by the
Agreement.” This policy, Boarding Individuals with Disabilities Who Use Mobility Aids to Ensure Access
and referred to as the Policy, was designed to ensure that individuals with disabilities who use mobility
aids have equal access to fixed-route buses. The “Initial Expert Report” was shared with the Board of
Directors in November, 2014.
The Settlement Agreement further required that the ADA Expert return to RTD “to review, audit and
prepare a written follow-up report to ensure that RTD has taken the actions identified in the Initial Expert
Report (“Mid-Year Report”)”. The “Initial Expert Report” did not identify any formal deficiencies
regarding RTD’s efforts in implementing the Policy. However, the ADA Expert did identify actions that
RTD could take to better implement the Policy and ensure that passengers with disabilities who use
mobility aids have equal access to the securement area. The “Mid-Year Report” provides an assessment
of RTD’s current progress with those recommended actions. A copy of the “Mid-Year Report” is
attached for review.
In June 2015, KFH Group, Inc., of Bethesda, Maryland, (the “ADA Expert”) returned to Denver and
conducted interviews with RTD staff personnel and members of the disability community, along with
riding several RTD buses. A review was also conducted on the current pass-up incident data and ADArelated customer complaints for fixed-route bus service.
The conclusions presented by KFH Group, Inc., stated that significant improvement had been made
regarding passengers boarding with strollers and occupying the securement area, however, additional
improvement could be made regarding passengers boarding with large items. The ADA Expert also
acknowledged the benefit of providing two dedicated staff positions to document and respond to ADArelated customer complaints. One recommendation was for RTD “to include additional information to
riders and the larger community about meeting the needs of riders with disabilities.”
Per the Settlement Agreement, the ADA Expert is to return to RTD on an annual basis for the next three
consecutive years to “review, audit and prepare a written report to ensure that individuals with
disabilities who use mobility aids have equal access to fixed-route buses (“Annual Report”).
Accordingly, KFH Group, Inc. is scheduled to return to RTD in June of 2016.

Mid-Year Report

In keeping with the Settlement Agreement (Agreement) between the Colorado Cross-Disability
Coalition (CCDC) and the Regional Transportation District (RTD) of Denver dated February 19, 2014,
this report is the required Mid-Year Report.
According to the Agreement, RTD was to retain a consultant that is experienced with Americans with
Disabilities (ADA) compliance with fixed route bus service and otherwise unaffiliated with the RTD to
review and audit RTD’s implementation and enforcement of the Policy required through the Agreement
and to prepare specified reports. The Policy, titled Boarding Individuals with Disabilities Who Use
Mobility Aids to Ensure Access, is included in Appendix A to this report. The purpose of the Policy as
set out in the Agreement is: “RTD will ensure individuals who use Mobility Aids, including Wheelchairs,
have equal access to its buses and to the Securement Areas.”
The first report specified by the Agreement, Initial Expert Report, was submitted in September 2014.
That report reviewed and assessed RTD’s early efforts with implementation and enforcement of the
Policy. This Mid-Year Report is the second report specified in the Agreement and, according to the
Agreement, the consultant is “to review, audit, and prepare a written follow-up report to ensure that
RTD has taken the actions identified in the Initial Expert Report.”
To prepare the Mid-Year Report, we reviewed the follow-up actions identified in the Initial Expert
Report through a number of efforts. These included reviewing the data reports required by the
Agreement, obtaining input from riders with disabilities, and interviewing a number of staff members of
RTD and its fixed route bus contractors regarding implementation and enforcement of the Policy.
While on-site for our work in early June 2015, we also rode fixed route buses for first hand observations.
The Mid-Year Report is organized with the following sections:

Findings and Conclusions of the Initial Expert Report
Assessment of Follow-Up Actions Identified in the Initial Expert Report
Input from Riders with Disabilities
Summary and Further Follow-Up

FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS OF THE INITIAL EXPERT REPORT
The Initial Expert Report had a number of findings, though these did not lead to any formal deficiencies
regarding RTD’s efforts in implementing the Policy and therefore no formal remedial actions were
required.
Among the findings of the Report, we documented concerns about the transition period that preceded
RTD’s full implementation of the Policy on September 1, 2014, a time period that caused some confusion
for bus operators and riders. As another example, the Report detailed the data collection and reporting

requirements stipulated in the Agreement and provided suggestions for improving RTD’s efforts in
complying with those requirements.

ASSESSMENT OF FOLLOW-UP ACTIONS IDENTIFIED IN THE INITIAL EXPERT
REPORT
1. ADA Refresher Training
The Agreement requires that bus operators and other operating staff as well as customer service
representatives participate in an annual “ADA Refresher Training” course. This training is to last for no
less than three hours total, with up to 45 minutes to cover the Policy. After the training, attendees are
to pass a test demonstrating an understanding of the material.
RTD has required annual refresher training for its bus operators for many years. For the RTD bus
operators, refresher training is a nine-hour day of training (the training had been eight hours but has
now been increased to nine), which includes three hours on the ADA and its requirements for transit
service. The ADA portion of the training includes specific material on the Policy.
The contractors are also required to provide annual ADA Refresher Training, according to the
Agreement, for its operators and other operating staff. The manager at the base location of one of the
contractors provides this training in one complete session; at the other locations, the contractors spread
the ADA training over three safety meetings, which is permitted by the Agreement.
RTD has indicated that, in addition to its operators, the other operating staff, including dispatchers and
street supervisors, also take the ADA refresher training, as required by the Agreement, though they do
not participate in the driving exercise. RTD’s customer service staff has not yet taken the ADA refresher
training.
As required by the Agreement, CCDC reviewed the training materials developed by RTD for the ADA
Refresher Training. The organization had several comments to the training, and RTD made suggested
revisions. These revised materials, including the PowerPoint slides, presenter’s notes, and the test at the
conclusion of the training, are now used for the annual refresher training by RTD as well as by the
contractors. After the training, the operators and other training attendees take a test and completion of
the test is documented in each individual’s personnel file.
The refresher training materials include several “what if” scenarios related to enforcement of the Policy,
with specific instructions on what the operator should do towards resolution. These slides seem
particularly effective, as they address situations that happen in day-to-day operations. We encourage
RTD to continue to include such materials and to ensure there is time in the training session for

While we did not find any formal deficiencies through our work for the Initial Expert Report, we did
identify four actions that the transit agency should pursue in its continued efforts to implement the
Policy and ensure equal access to RTD’s fixed route buses and to the securement areas for riders with
disabilities who use mobility aids. Our assessment of RTD’s progress in addressing those four actions
is provided below.

operators to bring up issues or situations they have personally faced when enforcing the Policy. This
would give the instructor the opportunity to discuss the recommended response.

We note that appropriate use of the extra space area in the buses is included in the training materials.
This is an area created by the removal of one of the bus seats behind the securement area, with the
objective of creating some room for riders to put larger items such as a folded stroller, suitcase, etc.
RTD reports that this space has been helpful in dealing with the larger items that riders bring on-b0ard.
Creation of this space began as a pilot during the summer of 2014 and now all RTD-operated buses have
an extra space area. RTD indicated that, as of June 2015, it has directed its two contractors to begin
removing the specified seat to create the extra space area on the buses that the contractors operate.
RTD expects that this work should be completed by the end of this August 2015.

2. Ensure Monitoring of Fixed Route Bus Service to Ensure Bus
Operators’ Compliance with the Policy.
The Agreement requires monitoring of bus operators’ compliance with the Policy in two ways: (1)
completion of the “CCDC Settlement Agreement Securement Area Issues Report” (Securement Area
Report), and (2) through a “Complaint Process” concerning the Policy. RTD also monitors its ongoing
bus service through deployment of Street Supervisors and its Undercover Ride Check Program.

CCDC Settlement Agreement Securement Area Issues Report (Securement Area
Report)
The Securement Area Report documents each incident that occurs when a bus operator presses the
ADA PAX PASS-UP button and each incident when a passenger complains that an operator has violated
the Policy.
The first Securement Area Report included data from March 22, 2014 (when the Policy was adopted)
through April 30, 2014. This was referred to as the “Initial Report” in the Agreement; it was submitted
on May 21, 2014 within the Agreement-specified timeline. This first Securement Area Report provides
data for just under six weeks. This first report and the efforts required for completion were reviewed in
detail in our Initial Expert Report.
In addition to the first Securement Area Report, the Agreement requires an annual Securement Area
Report beginning in 2015. RTD submitted this second Securement Area Report in January 2015, with
data from May 1, 2014 through the end of the calendar year 2014. This Report, due on January 15, 2015
according to the Agreement, was provided on January 26, a week and one-half after the specified date.
RTD notified CCDC in advance that the Report submission would be slightly delayed.

Consideration might be given to including staff from dispatch and street supervision with the operators
for the ADA Refresher Training sessions. This would provide the opportunity for broader discussion
about experiences faced by the operators in enforcing the Policy and shared discussion among the
different staff about enforcing the Policy. It was reported that operators have commented that
dispatchers and supervisors are not always consistent in the ways they support operators when issues
arise regarding the Policy.

1.C.2.a

Data from the first Securement Area Report can be compared to data from the second Report, as shown
in Table 1. Calculating the number of PASS-UPs on a weekly basis, there was approximately one fewer
PASS-UP per week in the second time period compared to the first. For both time periods, 65% – nearly
two-thirds – of the PASS-UP incidents occurred because there were two passengers with wheelchairs
occupying the two wheelchair securement areas. For both time periods, about 75% of the PASS-UP
incidents occurred because the securement areas were occupied by one rider using a wheelchair and a
second rider using another mobility aid.

Preparation of the Securement Area Report, as explained in the Initial Expert Report, is time-consuming,
requiring considerable staff resources and collection of numerous data elements from multiple sources
across different departments and organizations (RTD and the two contractors). We had suggested in

the Initial Expert Report that RTD consider using a relational database, such as Microsoft Access,
instead of Excel to collect and prepare the report. This would facilitate data collection, preparation of
the report, and particularly analysis.

Complaint Process Concerning the Policy
The Agreement required that RTD implement a process to receive, track, investigate, and resolve
complaints related to the Policy. RTD has an existing customer service function, which handles all
complaints, and complaints related to the Policy were folded into this function. Complaints related to
the Policy are a subset of complaints that are categorized as ADA complaints.
ADA complaints including those related to the Policy are investigated by either the designated staff at
RTD or customer service staff at the two contractors, as appropriate, with findings documented in a
detailed monthly Customer Service Report. The complaints related to the Policy are also documented
in the Securement Area Report, as required by the Agreement.
These Policy related complaints in the initial Securement Area Report and those in the second
Securement Area Report can be compared; see Table 2. Complaints related to the Policy for the initial
time period totaled nine, which computes to 6 complaints per month; for the second time period, there
were a total of 29 Policy-related complaints, or 3.6 per month, a decrease from the early time period. By
point of comparison, the average number of operator-related complaints for RTD and contractor
operated bus service received in 2014 is 1,844 per month.
While the number of Policy-related complaints is declining (and is also small in proportion to all bus
service complaints), the Policy complaints show that issues remain. Based on complaint frequency, it
appears that the more frequent problem related to the Policy is that riders place large items in the
securement area. This corresponds to feedback received from riders with disabilities who indicated to
us – during our on-site efforts for the Initial Expert Report as well as for this Mid-Year Report – that
riders still sometimes put their larger items in the securement area. In some cases, the bus operator has
not told the rider to move behind the securement area and, in at least one case documented by the
Customer Service Report investigation, the rider refused to move the items when asked to do so by the
operator. Incidents involving large items also correspond to feedback we received regarding Policyrelated work by RTD’s street supervisors and one of the contractors.
As shown in Table 2, there are also several complaints that the operator has not asked riders to fold
their strollers before boarding. And there are a few complaints resulting when a rider indicates to the
bus operator that a disability precludes folding the stroller.
Regarding strollers, it is noted that during our on-site work for this Mid-Year Report in early June, we
did not hear the automated announcement concerning strollers, based on bus trips on four different
routes (83L, 15L, 40, and 0). When the Policy was introduced in March 2014, RTD implemented an
automated announcement triggered when the bus door opened that said, “Strollers must be collapsed
prior to boarding.” When queried about the automated stroller announcement for this report, RTD

RTD has reported that efforts began in November 2014 to migrate the data to Access, with data from
May 1, 2014 through January 9, 2015 moved into an Access database. This effort, however, was
discontinued when the staff member working on the data was promoted to a new position and no
longer available to complete the task.

1.C.2.a

A review of some of the documented complaints shows that there is still some confusion among
operators as well as riders about the Policy. For example, one operator told a rider with a walker to fold
the walker before boarding, and in another complaint incident, the complainant said the operator did
not ask a rider with a walker sitting in the securement area to move from the securement area when it
was needed by a rider with a wheelchair. RTD’s policy on walkers is that riders do not have to fold
walkers before boarding, and such riders are allowed to sit in the securement area with their walker and
are not required to move if the securement area is needed by another rider with a mobility aid including
a wheelchair.

Street Supervisors
Street supervisors for RTD and the contractors have a role in enforcing the Policy, among their other
duties and responsibilities. We queried both RTD and the contractors for feedback regarding their
street supervisors’ experience related to the Policy.
RTD indicated that, from the perspective of supporting operators in Policy enforcement, the street
supervisors have seen particular improvement in riders’ compliance with the Policy. Reportedly, this is
particularly the case with strollers, and operators have noted that often riders with strollers have
already taken their children out of the stroller and have the stroller collapsed by the time the bus arrives
at the stop.
Also, it was reported that the existence of the extra space area on the buses has helped operators deal
with the issue of larger items brought aboard the bus. This has provided a legitimate area for riders to
place grocery caddies, luggage, folded strollers, and other such items.
One area of concern noted by RTD is an apparent increase in the number of riders who claim their cart,
dolly or other such wheeled item is their mobility device. This is a difficult situation for operators who
have been instructed to accept a rider’s claim of a disability. Yet these items are not being used for
personal mobility, as one typically uses a wheelchair or scooter, for which the securement area is
designed. RTD has further noted that operators are more often now seeking assistance and answers
from the street supervisors and managers about these difficult situations which often result in conflict
with the rider. In one such case, RTD worked with CCDC to resolve the issue and determine the
appropriate response. This involved a rider who has used a wheelchair – not as a personal mobility
device – but as a cart to transport a large item. Similarly, one of the contractors noted that there have
been instances when a rider boards with a wheelchair that is used to carry groceries and not for
personal mobility.
RTD has also reported that the more frequent Policy-related issue that street supervisors are called to
resolve involves riders who claim a disability for sitting in the securement area but do have not a
mobility device and who refuse to move when asked to do so by the operator. Reportedly, by the time
the supervisor arrives to assist, the rider has usually left the scene. Although, if the supervisor arrives
and the situation is still unfolding, RTD reports the supervisor is normally able to ensure compliance
with the Policy.

reports no official change from implementation of the announcements and that the announcement is
still programmed to operate.

1.C.2.a

One further comment by RTD is the fact that Denver’s rainy weather this past spring resulted in riders
who are homeless more frequently bringing their belongings onto the bus. This has resulted in some
conflicts as the belongings may not always fit behind the securement area or they may spill into the bus
aisle.

RTD’s Undercover Ride Check program uses part-time employees to provide unobserved checks of bus
operators’ compliance with specific duties and responsibilities related to ADA service, such as
announcing connecting transfer points, and includes a check of customer service to riders with
disabilities. Individuals hired for the position specifically include seniors and those with varying
disabilities. This program can be effective in ensuring that bus operators comply with ADA
requirements and provide effective customer service to riders with disabilities.
The form that the Ride Checkers complete for each bus trip observed in shown in Exhibit 1. While the
form asks the checker to observe whether the operator attempts to make room for a rider with a
mobility device, the form could be more specific regarding access specifically to the securement area,
for example, asking if the operator ensures that a rider with a wheelchair can get to and use the
wheelchair securement area.

3. ADA Complaints Related to the Policy for Contractor-Operated Service
At the time the Policy was adopted in March 2014, RTD augmented its complaint process to include
specific procedures to investigate and resolve complaints related to the Policy. These complaints are a
subset of riders’ complaints categorized as “ADA complaints.” Information about each Policy-related
complaint and the investigation procedures is included, as required, in the Securement Area Report.
Those riders with an ADA related complaint for RTD operated service who requested a response to their
complaint are called back by an RTD staff person. However, as discussed in the Initial Expert Report,
riders with a complaint about contractor-operated service who requested a response did not receive a
response. RTD’s contracts with its two private contractors had not required that the contractors reply
to complainants, though the contracts have required the contractors to investigate complaints and
follow through with operators as needed.
Our Initial Expert Report recommended that RTD ensure that riders with ADA complaints about
contractor-operated service who requested a response would receive a response. RTD had indicated
that new contract terms would require each of the two contractors to have a dedicated customer service
staff position with responsibilities to include responding to customers about ADA related complaints.
Since the submission of our Initial Expert Report, RTD has created and staffed two positions to assist
with meeting the reporting requirements stipulated in the Agreement, which includes support with the
customer service function. One of the positions is responsible for investigating ADA complaints,
including those related to the Policy, regarding RTD service and calling back complainants who ask for
a response. The second person has the same responsibility for contractor-operated service, and began
calling back riders with ADA and Policy complaints in April 2015. While RTD had initially considered
having the contractors take responsibility for calling back riders with ADA and Policy related

complaints, the transit agency decided to keep the function within RTD, which gives the agency more
control over the response provided to complainants. We support that decision as the preferred
approach over having the contractors respond to riders about Policy and other ADA related complaints.

The Initial Expert Report suggested that RTD consider adding additional information to its website and
other public information materials about the Policy. Information on the website under How to Ride the
Bus and then under Frequently Asked Questions now includes mention of the extra space area on the
buses. As noted earlier, this space was created to provide room for riders to place grocery caddies,
luggage, folded strollers and other large items that some riders had previously placed in the wheelchair
securement area.
RTD has reported that all of the RTD operated buses now have this designated area and signage has
been added in both English and Spanish (see Exhibit 2). As noted earlier, as of June 2015, RTD has
directed the contractors to create the extra space area on the buses they operate by removing the
designated seat. As the contractors complete this task on the buses they operate, RTD should ensure
that the space is signed. RTD should also ensure that its contractors are specifically instructed to inform
their operators about the new area and its purpose. We note that in our use of RTD buses while on-site,
we observed two buses (on routes #83L and #15L) that lacked signage for the extra space area. RTD
should check to ensure that signage is provided for the extra space area on all its buses
Once all the buses have the extra space area, RTD could consider adding more emphasis to the
availability of this area on its website and through other outreach media. While the extra space is
mentioned under the question “Can I bring large items, such as strollers or grocery caddies, on the
bus?” it might be given more emphasis and perhaps with a graphic showing, for example, the extra
space area with a folded stroller.

4. Information for Riders and the Public Related to the Policy

1.C.2.a

INPUT FROM RIDERS WITH DISABILITIES
During the on-site portion of efforts to prepare the Mid-Year Report in early June 2015, we met with the
Transit and Accessibility Task Force of the Denver Regional Mobility and Access Council (DRMAC) as
well as a CCDC representative. Input and comments received in these meeting with riders with
disabilities that are related to the Policy are summarized below.


There was general agreement that access to the wheelchair securement area has improved. In
particular, strollers which used to be a major challenge impacting access to the securement area
are reportedly no longer the problem they used to be.

Some of the specific comments made by riders include:
o
o
o
o
o

“A great deal of progress has been made.”
“Things are better.”
[Access to the securement area] is “less of an issue.”
“Usually passengers collapse strollers when asked.”
“Hostility has decreased.”



Despite general improvement, there are occasions when there are problems or issues. Several
specific occasions were described in the meetings when it was difficult to access the securement
area or the bus operator did not follow the Policy. There seemed to be agreement that these
were “exceptions.” Moreover, there appeared to be agreement that there would continue to be
“exceptions,” despite overall progress in enforcing the Policy. For example, it was noted that,
particularly on certain routes, there may be riders who are homeless and who bring various
belongings on board that spill out into the aisle. Or, as reported, a bus operator once allowed a
parent traveling alone with a baby in a stroller as well as a very young child and a three- or fouryear old to board without collapsing the stroller first—apparently because it would have been
difficult and probably unsafe for the rider to take the baby out of the stroller and collapse it
before boarding while also trying to hold the baby and handle the other two children. According
to one rider with a disability, such exceptions, if prompted by safety concerns, may be
understandable.



Enforcement of the Policy is uneven. It was mentioned that when an operator is new to a
specific route (e.g., after the three-times-per-year scheduled “votes” when operators choose
routes to operate), the operator will be unfamiliar with the regular riders and not attuned to
what is specifically needed to ensure full compliance with the Policy. It was also said that the
11

Mid-Year Report l KFH Group

Packet Pg. 50

Attachment: ADA Expert Mid Year Report_PDF (2518 : ADA Expert Mid-Year Report)

We continue to suggest that the website material with information on how to ride the bus under Rider
Tools and specifically the six steps for using the bus should include some information pertaining to
riders using mobility devices. For example, Step #4,Verify Your Route and Board The Bus, might include
a sentence that informs riders that, if there is a rider with a wheelchair or other mobility device at your
stop also waiting to board, be courteous and allow that rider to board first. This practice is included in
the Policy: “It is not acceptable to allow the able-bodied passengers to board first, leaving insufficient
space for the Individual with a Disability with a Mobility Aid. You should attempt to board individuals
with a Mobility Aid prior to boarding others waiting at the bus stop to ensure access to the Securement
Areas.”

1.C.2.a



Access for riders with walkers can be challenging. It was reported that riders using walkers or
with larger grocery caddies have difficulty getting down the aisle and behind the securement
area on RTD’s newer buses. This is not directly related to the Policy but it is a problem for such
riders. The newer buses have two panels in front of the seats directly behind the securement
area, and the size and configuration of the panels result in a narrowing of the aisle. RTD reports
that the transit agency has ordered new panels for these buses to address this issue, and the
buses will be retrofitted once the new panels arrive. This process will likely take several months.
RTD also reports that the bus manufacturer is now installing the new panels on the remaining
buses being built for RTD.



There were questions about the complaint process and RTD response to complaints. Members
of the Task Force noted that they do not always receive a call back when they submit a
complaint to RTD. One rider was frustrated by this, and others were unsure about RTD’s policy
for calling back riders who have complained. RTD staff explained that its Customer Care
Department, which receives riders’ complaints, does not automatically ask riders if they would
like a response or call back when submitting their complaint by telephone. We note, however,
that the “Customer Comment Form” on the RTD website, which allows a rider to submit a
complaint (or question, comment, etc.) electronically, does ask the individual if a response is
desired after the investigation is complete. If a rider is submitting a complaint through this
method, it is perhaps this option that has contributed to the riders’ questions about RTD’s
policy. We note, however, that RTD reports that its staff does respond to riders’ whose
complaints are categorized as ADA (which includes complaints about the Policy) and who
request a response.
Complaints that are categorized as ADA related including those related to the Policy are sent to
the two RTD staff members who have responsibility for investigating and following up on ADA
complaints. For those complainants who request a call back, the two staff members will
respond. The complainant may provide a telephone number or email address for the response,
which is then provided once the complaint investigation is completed. For those who request a
response via telephone, RTD makes three attempts to reach the rider. RTD reports that if the
individual is not reached, a message will be left on an answering machine. We note, as described
in detail in the Initial Expert Report, that the complaint investigation is time-consuming, with
information and data required from multiple sources and with various forms to complete. It is
possible that this time lag between the incident that triggered the complaint and a response
weeks later contributes to some riders’ confusion or misunderstanding about RTD’s complaint
response practice.

12
Mid-Year Report l KFH Group

Packet Pg. 51

Attachment: ADA Expert Mid Year Report_PDF (2518 : ADA Expert Mid-Year Report)

contractors’ operators are less likely than RTD operators to enforce the Policy as well as enforce
other policies, for example, reprimanding unruly passengers on the bus. Reportedly, the
contractors’ drivers in general seem “less empowered” to enforce policies governing rider
behavior.

1.C.2.a

SUMMARY AND FURTHER FOLLOW-UP

Input from riders with disabilities and feedback from operating staff at RTD and its contractors indicate
significant improvement regarding strollers, which previously had been a major problem impeding
access to the securement areas. There has been some improvement regarding large items but it appears
less progress with large items than with strollers. The latter is reportedly impacted by at least two
factors: riders who bring large items onto the bus and claim the item is a mobility device when it is
functioning not as a personal mobility device but as a way to transport smaller items (and there have
been occasions when the large item is actually a wheelchair used to carry groceries or other things); and
riders who are homeless and bring their belongings onto the bus which do not necessarily fit behind the
securement area and may extend out into the aisle.
While there were no formal remedial actions required in the Initial Expert Report as we found no formal
deficiencies, we did identify four actions that RTD should pursue to ensure compliance with the Policy.
Reviewing these actions for the Mid-Year Report has found the following:








RTD should ensure that its customer service staff takes the ADA Refresher Training. This is
required by the Agreement.
Efforts should continue to enforce the Policy and to specifically focus on outreach to educate
riders about large items. Consistent enforcement of the Policy by the contractors should also be
a focus.
RTD completed and submitted the required Securement Area Report in January 2015. Efforts
had begun to move the Report’s database from Excel into Access. We suggest that these efforts
be completed since an effective relational database is expected to facilitate RTD’s preparation of
future reports and subsequent analysis of the data.
RTD has now provided and filled the two staff positions that had been requested to support the
requirements of the Policy. One of the positions is responsible for responding to ADA-related
complaints for contractor-operated service. As documented in the Initial Expert Report, such
response for the contractors’ service was not previously provided, and RTD was considering
having the contractors responsible for this function. Instead, RTD has decided to handle the
responses, which we believe is the preferred option.
We continue to suggest that RTD include additional information to riders and the larger
community about meeting the needs of riders with disabilities. Some new material has been
added, specifically the extra space area is identified. Opportunities remain to add to website and
other public information materials about meeting the needs of riders with disabilities and
particularly those who use wheelchairs.

RTD and its two contractors continue their efforts in enforcing the Policy so that riders using
wheelchairs and other mobility aids who need access to the wheelchair securement areas on the fixed
route buses can actually get to and use the securement areas. The data reports required by the
Agreement show that in the large majority of the cases when there are PASS-UPs, the reason is because
both wheelchair securement areas are filled – either with two riders using wheelchairs or with a rider
using a wheelchair and a second rider using a different mobility aid.

Call-n-Ride Comments:
Evergreen CnR – A strong Call-n-Ride over the years, there are two major factors in the decline of
ridership: a school closed whose students rode CnR and the Extension program for the disabled
moved and acquired their own bus. We have met with the Seniors’ Resources Center (SRC) and
they have been actively working with the senior living communities and the schools to increase
ridership. A Transportation Advisory Committee (TAC) has been formed to evaluate the service and
make recommendations for change. The TAC has made some recommendations that should be
implemented this fall.
Federal Heights – This CnR was started in January 2012 with a CMAQ grant with the local share
funded by Federal Heights (no RTD funds). RTD recommended discontinuance of the CnR in January
2015; however, the community and RTD agreed to keep the CnR for 1 year at a 50% cost share to
each party. In 2014 an advocate started teaching seniors how to use the CnR. This has worked and
ridership began rising later in 2014. RTD worked with the communities and Water World in providing
service for employees.

Highlands Ranch - This CnR opened with the Southeast Corridor in November 2006. Highlands
Ranch CnR replaced the poorly performing Rte 426 Ranch Rider. Over the years RTD has tried
numerous adjustments to the service area and marketing. It has been recommended to be
discontinued twice. Highlands Ranch has carried a high percentage of Access-a-Ride qualified users.
While the subsidy is high for the CnR, if CnR were to be discontinued, this ridership would move to
Access-a-Ride where the subsidy would be much higher. Douglas County has contributed financially
to the CnR in the past. In 2015 Douglas County and Highlands Ranch will cost share with the RTD
for 50% of the subsidy. A TAC was formed to reevaluate service and marketing to increase
ridership. The TAC has come up with some ideas that are in the process of being implemented in the
August 2015 runboard.
Parker – This CnR opened with the Southeast Corridor in November 2006. Over the years RTD has
made adjustments to the service area and marketing. It has been recommended to be discontinued
twice. In 2015 Douglas County and the Town of Parker will cost share with the RTD for 50% of the
subsidy. A TAC was formed to reevaluate service and marketing to increase ridership. The TAC has
come up with some ideas that are in the process of being implemented in the August 2015 runboard.
South Jeffco – In the August 2015 runboard, the S. Jeffco Call-n-Ride will go through a major
change in the operations of the Call-n-Ride. A new service plan was implemented in August that
will help to ensure a more reliable service to the customer.
Note: All Call-n-Rides operate with a computer and scheduling software. The current computers in
use are old and this effects our Call-n-Ride operations. New computers have been ordered and
should be in use in the next 2-3 months.

Access-a-Ride/Cab 2nd Quarter 2015 Report

Ridership
Access-a-Ride ridership increased by 2% through the 2nd quarter of 2015 compared to the same period
of 2014. Productivity decreased from 1.25 to 1.19 passengers per hour. During the same period,
Access-a-Cab ridership increased by 1%. The increased use of Access-a-Cab by Access-a-Ride
passengers allows RTD to accommodate increased total program ridership while limiting the need to
increase resources devoted to Access-a-Ride. Combined Access-a-Ride and Access-a-Cab ridership
increased by 2% compared to 2014. Total boardings increased from 449,781 total boardings thru Q2
of 2014 to 457,560 total boardings thru Q2 of 2015.
Revenue Hours
Revenue hours of service provided on Access-a-Ride increased by 7% during the 2nd quarter of 2015 as
compared to the same period of 2014. Access-a-Ride is approximately 3% under budgeted revenue
hours through the second quarter of 2015.
On-Time Performance
Carrier on-time performance through the 2nd quarter of 2015 was 95.60% a slight increase as compared
to the same period of 2014. Our private contractors continue to address on-time performance
challenges. Several of the carriers are utilizing the radio and billboards as a means of attracting potential
operators.
Passenger on-time performance through the 2nd quarter of 2015 was 84.27% an increase as compared
to the same period in 2014 (83.45).
Customer Complaints
Complaints per passenger increased through the 2nd quarter of 2015 as compared to the same period in
2014 as complaints increased from .0009 complaints per passenger boarding to .0011 complaints per
passenger boarding. Staff continues to work with our carriers and passengers to improve overall
customer satisfaction.

Contracted Fixed-Route Quarterly Report – 2nd
Quarter 2015

Information

The following is a discussion of the performance measures for the second quarter of 2015 for the fixedroute services provided by private contractors:


PREVENTABLE VEHICLE ACCIDENTS PER 100,000 MILES
The contractors, individually and as a group, met the target of ≤ 2.0 Preventable Vehicle
Accidents per 100,000 miles in the 2nd quarter. First Transit and Transdev (formerly known as
Veolia Transportation) continue to utilize bus operator monitoring technology and post-accident
investigations for retraining of operators. The contractors continue to emphasize safety with all
employees at monthly safety meetings, through periodic campaigns, and with daily reminders at
their facilities.



PASSENGER ACCIDENT RATIO PER 100,000 MILES
The contractors, individually and as a group, met the target of ≤ 0.18 Passenger Accidents per
100,000 miles in the 2nd quarter. All of the four passenger accidents that occurred in the 2nd
quarter were classified as non-preventable. First Transit and Transdev continue to raise
awareness of passenger safety to reduce the number of passenger accidents per 100,000 miles.



ON-TIME PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE INSPECTIONS
The contractors, individually and as a group, met the target of 98% of Preventive Maintenance
Inspections completed as scheduled in the 2nd quarter. RTD and the contractor organizations
place a high emphasis on completing preventive maintenance inspections as required, and as
such, the local operations are diligent about completing these inspections on time.



ON-TIME PERFORMANCE
Transdev, First Transit Denver, and First Transit Longmont met the target of 88% Local On-Time
Service with 88.8% and 88.4% and 88.8% on-time performance respectively in the 2nd quarter.
First Transit Commerce City improved on time performance during 2nd quarter from 83.1% to
83.6%. RTD and the private contractors continue to campaign routes and operators with low on
time performance with a strong focus on first time point departures. On a monthly basis
contractors review the OTP report and meet with operators of low performing routes to discuss
factors that are impacting their ability to reach 88% on time performance. Running time issues
are forwarded to RTD Service Planning and Scheduling for review.
The contractors will continue to address on-time performance issues with operators, but always
tie safety to the discussion. It’s better to be a few minutes late than to have an accident.



MILES BETWEEN LOST SERVICE ROAD CALLS

Packet Pg. 71

1.C.6

The contractors, individually and as a group, exceeded the target of 26,000 Miles Between Lost
Service Maintenance Road Calls in the 2nd quarter. The contractors continue to improve in this
area by completing preventive maintenance inspections on time, working off defects in a timely
manner, monitoring repeat issues, providing additional training for mechanics, and taking a proactive approach to maintaining the buses in their fleets.


OPERATOR COMPLAINTS PER BOARDING
First Transit Longmont met the target of .0004 Complaints per Boarding with .0003 complaints
per boarding in the 2nd quarter. The contractors continue to investigate and address customer
complaints with operators. The contractors utilize onboard video surveillance as a coaching tool
to assist operators in improving customer interactions. In addition, the steps noted above
regarding on-time performance should help address some customer complaints. The contractors
also continue to address complaint trends with all operators at monthly safety meetings.

Customer Complaint Analysis 2nd Quarter
2015

Recapped below is an analysis of the customer complaint trends for the 2nd Quarter of 2015. Also
included is a comparison of customer complaint data for the same period in 2014.
As noted in previous reports, in 2007 and 2008, RTD and the private contractors were meeting the
performance goal for customer complaints of .0002 complaints per passenger boarding. In 2009, RTD
began stricter enforcement of the fare policy and the priority seating area policy which advised
passengers with strollers or other large items that they would need to move from the priority seating
area if those seats were needed for disabled passengers. In addition, RTD posted notices on all buses
and light rail vehicles advising passengers of the requirement under Title VI of the Civil Rights Law for
operators to call out transfer points. Following the implementation of these policies/procedures,
customer complaints increased, but for 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 RTD and the private contractors
performed, for the most part, at a level of .0003 to .0004 complaints per passenger boarding. In 2012,
the performance goal for passenger complaints was adjusted to .0003 complaints per passenger
boarding. The goal for 2014 was again adjusted to account for the static higher level of complaints due
to the securement area/priority seating issues, the fare enforcement campaigns, TIC availability,
introduction of SmartCards, and the new West Line service. The goal for 2015 remains at .0004
complaints per passenger boarding.
For the 2nd Quarter of 2015, RTD and First Transit Longmont met the goal of .0004 complaints per
passenger boarding. First Transit Commerce City, First Transit Denver and Transdev (formerly Veolia)
had .0005 complaints per passenger boarding. The combined performance for all of the private
contractors was .0005 complaints per passenger boarding. The combined performance for RTD and the
private contractors was .0004 complaints per passenger boarding.
RTD staff, as well as the private contractors, monitor and address customer complaints on a daily basis.
RTD and the private contractors investigate all customer complaints using a variety of tools, including
CAD/AVL “flashbacks” and video review and address/discipline operators as needed. Many times the
results of the investigation reveal that the complaint is not valid. Some of the reasons for the “Not
Valid” classification include the following:
Bus was on time (between 1 min early to 5 min late) per “flashback”
Operator followed proper procedure
Passenger presented insufficient fare
Passenger had no proof of eligibility for a discounted fare
Passenger presented an expired transfer
Passenger presented a counterfeit pass
Buses were running late District-wide due to weather
There was no video evidence to support the complaint

Packet Pg. 74

1.C.7

RTD and the private contractors continue to work collectively in a variety of different areas to address
customer complaints.
 Bus routes with poor on-time performance are monitored by both RTD and private contractor
personnel to determine if the problem is related to the operator or the running time of the route.
 Meetings are held on a monthly basis with contractor and RTD personnel to discuss challenges,
solutions and best practices in the areas of bus maintenance, operations, safety and training.
 Bus operator trainers from RTD and the private contractors meet weekly in an effort to ensure
consistency in training messages and practices and produce a quarterly newsletter which is
shared with operations personnel.
 RTD is conducting refresher training for all operators on an annual basis, and a component of the
training is customer service. The private contractors conduct mandatory monthly safety meetings
wherein they discuss customer service issues and provide suggestions for improving passenger
interactions.
 RTD and private contractor trainers spend time at Civic Center Station and Denver Union Station
the first week of each runboard to provide assistance to operators who may need some
refreshers on station procedures or have questions on their routes.
 RTD has also reached out to the disability community (Colorado School of the Blind, Atlantis,
DRMAC Transit Accessibility Task Force) to get feedback on ways to improve RTD service for
passengers with disabilities.
 Operators are recognized for the good customer service they provide. Divisions post
commendations on a bulletin board in the drivers’ room and some provide additional means of
recognition.
Historically, and in 2015, the following complaint categories generated the highest number of customer
complaints:
Bus Did Not Show
Bus Early
Bus Late
Careless Driving/Operator
Discourtesy/Operator
Improper Procedure by Operator
Passed Up Passenger at Stop
All of these complaint categories are what RTD considers “operator related” and are included in the
complaint numbers that are tracked and reported to the Board of Directors on the Quarterly Performance
Report.
The high complaint categories are routinely reviewed to determine the factors, both internal and
external, that are impacting the number of complaints. The input received from both RTD and private
contractor operations is noted below:
Bus Did Not Show – 2nd Quarter 2015: the complaints in this category decreased 1.9% compared to
the same period in 2014. In many cases, CAD/AVL “flashbacks” confirm that buses are on route, but
running late. However, from the passenger’s perspective, the bus did not show. The YTD average in
this category for 2015 is 4.5 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2014 was 4.6 complaints
per day.
Bus Early – 2nd Quarter 2015: complaints in this category increased 4.0% compared to the same period
in 2014. “Flashbacks” for “bus early” complaints often show buses running late. It is possible
passengers see the prior bus running late and will assume it is their bus running early. Operators are

Packet Pg. 75

1.C.7

addressed whenever the CAD/AVL playback confirms that the bus was running ahead of schedule. The
YTD average in this category for 2015 is 5.3 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2014
was 5.1 complaints per day.
Bus Late – 2nd Quarter 2015: complaints in this category increased 2.7 % compared to the same period
in 2014. Improving on-time performance continues to be a challenge for a variety of reasons including
construction, traffic and heavy ridership delays; service reductions, which result in the same number of
passengers on fewer trips; and the inability to fund service improvements to address running-time
issues. The YTD average in this category for 2015 is 11.4 complaints per day. The comparable number
for 2014 was 11.1 complaints per day.
Careless Driving/Operator – 2nd Quarter 2015: complaints in this category increased 12.3% compared
to the same period in 2014. On a regular basis, video recordings are reviewed and undercover ride
checks are performed to determine if operators are driving in an unsafe or inappropriate manner. In
addition, RTD and the private contractors have “G-force activated” event-recording systems (Drive Cam,
Smart Drive) installed on the buses. These incidents are also reviewed on a daily basis. Operators
continue to be counseled and retrained as needed to improve driving performance. Also, periodic safety
campaigns are conducted to reinforce safe driving habits. The YTD average in this category for 2015 is
5.1 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2014 was 4.5 complaints per day.
Discourtesy/Operator – 2nd Quarter 2015: complaints in this category increased 4.2% compared to the
same period in 2014. In the majority of cases, video evidence confirms that the operator followed
proper procedures and treated the customer with respect. In many cases, operators are shown
enforcing or explaining policies (requesting proper fare payment, requesting space in the priority seating
area, addressing inappropriate behavior) in a polite and respectful manner and the passengers react in a
negative manner. Operators are counseled and disciplined if video evidence confirms that they treated
passengers in a discourteous or inappropriate manner. Operators are also given suggestions for handling
similar situations in the future. The YTD average in this category for 2015 is 11.4 complaints per day.
The comparable number for 2014 was 10.9 complaints per day.
Discrimination – 2nd Quarter 2015: complaints in this category decreased 18.6% compared to the same
period in 2014. Investigation into discrimination-related complaints usually shows the operator not at
fault. The YTD average in this category for 2015 is 0.27 complaints per day. The comparable number
for 2014 was 0.33 complaints per day.
Fare Dispute – 2nd Quarter 2015: complaints in this category decreased 18.9% compared to the same
period in 2014. It appears passengers have come to accept the fact that operators are expecting fares
to be paid upon boarding. Investigations into “fare dispute” complaints often show that passengers
presented an improper/incomplete fare and are not happy with the operators’ enforcement of the fare
policies. The YTD average in this category for 2015 is 0.95 complaints per day. The comparable
number for 2014 was 1.17 complaints per day.
Improper Procedure/Operator – 2nd Quarter 2015: complaints in this category decreased 2.5%
compared to the same period in 2014. RTD and private contractor training and operations personnel
meet on a regular basis to ensure all operators are receiving consistent and up-to-date information. In
addition, the on-going refresher training provided to RTD operators and the monthly safety meetings held
at the private contractor divisions provide operators with information about accommodating the needs of
RTD passengers to the best of their abilities. In cases where video evidence shows operators are not
following proper procedures, appropriate action is taken. The YTD average in this category for 2015 is
8.1 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2014 was 8.3 complaints per day.

Incorrect Info/Operator – 2nd Quarter 2015: complaints in this category decreased 19.3% compared to
the same period in 2014. The combined efforts of the General Superintendent of Transportation, the
Bus Operator Training Newsletter Team, Street Supervisors and Dispatchers are providing operators with
up-to-date information to answer customer questions and address customer concerns. The YTD average
in the category for 2015 is 0.39 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2014 was 0.49
complaints per day.
Passed Up Passenger At Stop – 2nd Quarter 2015: complaints in this category increased 9.0%
compared to the same period in 2014. In many cases, “flashbacks” for these complaints will confirm
buses are on route and either on time or running late. It is possible the passenger was not directly at the
stop when the bus arrived. Many complaint comments indicate the passenger was running to the stop
as the bus passed. Operators are reminded to stay vigilant and watch for passengers that may not be
waiting directly at the bus stop. In addition, operators are directed to contact RTD Dispatch whenever a
passenger is passed up due to the bus being full. The number of “Pass Up” complaints from passengers
with disabilities and/or those using mobility aids represents a small number of the total “Pass Up”
complaints (70 of the total 1,996 = 3.5%). Information regarding overcrowded routes is forwarded to
the Service Planning & Scheduling Department for review and adjustment as needed and as resources
will allow. The YTD average in this category for 2015 is 11.0 complaints per day. The comparable
number for 2014 was 10.1 complaints per day.

Customer Satisfaction Survey
Although customer complaints help identify those areas in which RTD and the private contractors can
continue to improve the quality of service provided, the results of the 2011 Customer Satisfaction
Survey indicate that the majority of RTD passengers are satisfied with RTD services. On a scale of 1
(poor) to 5 (excellent), over 80% of bus, light rail, Call-n-Ride, and SkyRide passengers rated RTD either
a 4 or a 5.
Specific driver related areas that received ratings of 4.0 or higher were as follows:
Courtesy of bus driver
Driving skills
Drivers’ knowledge of their specific route
Drivers’ ability to answer your questions about bus service
Drivers announcing transfer stops

Inspection Summary

Information

DISCUSSION:
Fare Enforcement Statistics
Fare inspectors, security officers, street supervisors, and police officers, conduct fare inspection onboard buses and light rail vehicles. RTD’s policy is to provide a warning to first time offenders and then
to issue a citation if that person is contacted a second time without fare. The table below shows the
actual number of patrons without fare that resulted in warnings or citations. The variation in numbers
from month to month may be due to several factors: special events or other security security-related
incidents.

Light Rail Station Sweeps and on-Board Enforcement Sweeps
In addition to the regular on-board fare enforcement, security officers conduct random, unannounced
fare checks at light rail platforms twice a week. Below are the numbers of patrons contacted during the
quarter. Any area that exhibits a higher fare evasion rate, we go back to that area and conduct an onboard enforcement sweep.

Plain Clothes Police Officer Fare Inspection
Police Officers are placed on bus and rail vehicles that have been identified by operators, supervisors,
dispatch logs and patrons as having a high perception of fare evasion, fare disputes or other problems.
The following tables summarize information for the months of April, May, and June. These tables lists
the number of patron boardings observed, no fare or partial fares, the estimated fare evasion rate, the
number of warnings and citations issued, and the number of arrests made by police officers. Arrests

include citations issued or physical arrests made for criminal violations other than fare evasion. This is
an additional advantage to the plain clothes police fare inspection program as peace officers have the
authority to check for warrants and take the appropriate law enforcement action. This quarter the bus
routes inspected include the 15, 16, 31 & 0.

The below chart shows the plain clothes police fare enforcement observations for light rail. There is a
slightly higher fare evasion rate observed by the plain clothes program than for the rail station sweeps
and bus enforcement because of the following factors:
 Fare station sweeps are conducted by uniformed security officers; these officers require all
patrons to have fare before boarding vehicles
 Rail operators do not have any interface with patrons, while bus operators do ask for fare
 Plain clothes police officers do not have a deterrence factor as uniformed officers, thus they
inherently find more violations of fare evasion.

Security Officer Use of Force Incidents
Use of Force is defined as any hands on touching of a suspect by a security officer to detain a suspect
or make a citizen’s arrest. The majority of these issues are minor in nature. No injuries to any suspect
or officer occurred in this reporting quarter. The following table summarizes the use of force incidents
per month.
