#### 1. Purchase Additional Seventeen (17) Light    Rail Vehicles

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorizes the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into a contract with Siemens to purchase an additional seventeen (17) Light Rail Vehicles and spare parts, at a cost not too exceed $64.5 million.

Motion:              Director Folska made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the September 15, 2015 Board Meeting.

Director Solano seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Terry Emmons, Assistant General Manager for Light Rail Operations, stated that due to increased ridership, and based on the ridership projections for the Southeast Extension and I-225 corridor, staff is requesting seventeen (17) additional light rail vehicles.  He explained that this will give staff the ability to maintain our aging fleet and maintain service levels as outlined in the Board approved Service Standards.  He said that funding is programmed in the Strategic Budget Plan and will be secured through Certificates of Participation (COPs).  He noted it takes two years to build a light rail vehicle so it is important that staff is proactive in looking towards the future.

Phil Eberl, General Superintendent of Light Rail Maintenance, reminded the Board that in 2014, when staff made their initial request for twelve (12) additional light rail vehicles, it was requested that the seating arrangement be changed from knee-to-knee to knee-to-back.  At that time there had also been discussion about changing the exterior of the vehicle so it looked more modern; however, it would be for only a small portion of our vehicles, and require additional parts for maintenance, so staff feels it is in RTD’s best interest to keep the exterior the same.

Director Hoy wondered if RTD had ever ordered trains with a different body style.  Phil Eberl stated that we had not.  He said in 2014 RTD was told by the manufacturer that they no longer built our body style; however, Siemens has decided that since RTD is one of their best customers they are willing to open the old assembly line to help us maintain fleet consistency.

Director Hoy inquired if the vehicles would have the same seating capacity with the new configuration.  Phil Eberl explained that the seating configuration does not change the number of passenger seats.  The new vehicles will be maximizing the ADA capacity which will reduce the number of passenger seats.

Director Francone asked for clarification if staff was requesting to purchase twelve light rail vehicles or seventeen.  Terry Emmons said that the purchase of twelve vehicles was approved by the Board in November, 2015.  Staff is requesting the purchase of an additional seventeen vehicles for a total of twenty-nine new light rail vehicles.

Director Lubow expressed concern as it appears the spare ratio will get very low.  She wondered how this happened.  Phil Eberl noted that Director Lubow was referring to the Maintenance Spares graph included in the Board Report.  He explained that the spare ratio would be at 5% in 2017 due to the addition of four cars to service as well as the projections for the Southeast Rail Extension and I-225 Corridor.  This action will return the fleet to a 17% spare ratio by 2018.

Director Lubow pointed out that two of the vehicles will be funded through FasTracks while the remaining vehicles are funded through the base system.  She wondered how the division of funding was being determined.  She wondered if that meant that 15 of the trains would run only on the existing T-Rex lines.  Interim General Manager Genova explained that for light rail operations there is a cost allocation with FasTracks because the vehicles can run anywhere on the system.  Certain vehicles are not dedicated to certain lines.

Director Lasater stated that when he first became a Board member he was told that the light rail vehicles for the Southeast Rail Extension were already paid for and in service.  He wondered why staff is saying there is a need for more vehicles when light rail ridership is below original projections and RTD already has the vehicles for the Southeast Rail Extension.  Terry Emmons explained that we are increasingly running four-car trains, which was not anticipated when the original fifty-five vehicles were purchased, as well as having higher ridership projections for the Southeast Rail Extension and I-225 Corridor.  Director Lasater asked how much ridership is projected to increase for the Southeast Rail Line.  Eric Miller, Senior Rail Service Planner and Scheduler, stated that there will be about a 10% increase in Southeast Rail Line ridership over initial projections.

Director Menten asked if there are any light rail vehicles that are not in-service as they are waiting to be rebuilt and what the cost is to rebuild a vehicle.   Phil Eberl stated that there was one vehicle out-of-service.  It would cost approximately $300-$400K to repair a vehicle.  Director Menten indicated she had additional questions she would take offline.

Committee Chair Anderson declared the motion PASSED.

#### 2. Recommended EcoPass Pricing for 2016

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors approves an 18.3 percent price increase for Business EcoPass and a 13.3 percent price increase for Neighborhood EcoPass. These price increases are for 2016 contracts. In addition, it is recommended that the current $2.50 DIA surcharge be eliminated for both the Business EcoPass and Neighborhood EcoPass programs.

Prior to the Board having the opportunity to move the recommended action read into the record by Committee Chair Anderson, Director Bagley made the motion to approve Alternative 2.

Motion to

Approve

Substitute

Main Motion:              Director Bagley made the motion to approve Alternative 2, which reads:

“Adopt an 18.3 percent price increase for Business EcoPass but phase it in over two years with a 13.3 percent price increase for 2016 contracts and an additional 4.4 percent price increase for 2017 contracts.  Adopt a 13.3 percent increase for Neighborhood EcoPass contracts to be applied in 2016.  Eliminate the current $2.50 DIA surcharge from both the Business and Neighborhood EcoPass programs.”

Chair Sisk seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Director Hoy inquired if the Board should be given the opportunity to move the motion read into the record by Committee Chair Anderson before other motions were made.  Marla Lien, General Counsel, stated that there was not a motion made on the recommended action read by Committee Chair Anderson.  She explained that protocol would have required Director Bagley to be recognized by the Chair of the Committee, which did not happen; however, right now the motion made by Director Bagley is on the table.

Director Lasater noted that the math is not correct in determining the percentage increase as 13.3 and 4.4 do not equal 18.3.  Interim General Manager Genova explained that it is a compounded effect, not a cumulative increase.

Director Bagley explained that the reason for his motion is that in reading the packet he sensed there was some trepidation on the part of some of the businesses.  He thought this was an opportunity to provide an alternative to the straight 18.3 percent increase.  He stated that Committee Chair Anderson never read a motion, she read a recommended action.  He said he made a motion and it was appropriate.

Chair Sisk said he very much appreciates Director Bagley making the motion to approve Alternative 2, as he thinks this is an option that bares a great deal of thought.   He noted that there were a number of statistics used in determining the 13.3% fare increase, which is imbedded in Director Bagley’s motion; however, RTD is asking the businesses to take on an 18.3% increase immediately.  He expressed concern that RTD has not yet made the case for an 18.3% increase.  He understands the need for compliance with Title VI but feels there is more work to be done.  He said Director Bagley’s motion allows RTD to spend the next year to really focus on SmartCard data that will really show what the actual increase should be.

Director Lasater requested that the meeting go back to normal process and allow staff to do their presentation.  He feels that for those that were not at the Study Session it would be nice to hear the presentation.  He also thinks it might answer additional questions that other Directors may have.

Committee Chair Anderson indicated that she would allow Director Lubow to speak first.

Director Lubow said she had the same concern as Director Lasater.  She would like to hear staff’s presentation as well as the opinion of Marla Lien as RTD’s General Counsel.

Lacy Bell, Planning Project Manager, reviewed a Power Point presentation with the Board that is available in the September 8, 2015 Operations and Customer Service Committee Agenda Packet.  She outlined the Fare study Process, Stakeholder Outreach Groups, Stakeholder Feedback, Staff Recommendations for 2016 Contract Pricing, Title VI Equity Analysis, Revenue Impacts and Next Steps.

Marla Lien said that she does not make decisions, the Board does; all she does is give advice.  She stated that if there are any repercussions from a decision made by the Board, they will fall solely to the board, not Boulder County or the business community.  Staff has done their work and is giving the Board their best recommendations.  The Board is free to make policy choices that staff does not recommend based on Title VI because they have other concerns; however, if FTA has an issue with what RTD is doing that will be up to the Board to address with FTA.

Marla Lien explained that she has not been involved in the EcoPass program because there have not been serious Title VI issues; however, Michael Washington, Manager of Title VI, came to her with concerns.  In reviewing the program, staff found out there was over a 30% difference between the number of low-income riders who had access to Business EcoPasses and non-low-income riders.   Staff found out that there was over a 10% difference of minority riders who had access to Business EcoPasses and non-minority riders.  Finally, staff found that the weighted average fare paid by EcoPass riders was lower than the weighted average fare for of the rest of the riders.  She said that ultimately means RTD is giving a higher subsidy per boarding to non-low-income, non-minority riders than to low-income, minority riders, which was a concern.  She explained that based on this staff developed a recommendation that equalized the subsidies.

Marla Lien reiterated that the Board can choose to do something else; however, if there is an FTA issue or investigation it will fall on the Board.

Director Folska made a point of order and asked to make a motion to go back to the original motion made by staff.  Marla Lien explained that Director Folska would be making a motion to amend Director Bagley’s motion.  Director Solano seconded the motion.

Committee Chair Anderson expressed that she was going to take the opportunity to speak as the Chair of the Committee.  Director Folska pointed out that she had made a motion.  Committee Chair Anderson said that she did not hear Director Folska make a motion and was going to take the opportunity to speak as Chair of the Committee.

Committee Chair Anderson stated that she would be voting against this motion because it is an issue of equity.  She believes Director Bagley’s motion should be voted down so that there can be another motion and the Board can vote on staff’s original recommendation.

Director Folska again made a point of order stating that she previously made a motion to go back to the original recommended action that was seconded.  She stated that her motion is now on the floor and requires a vote.  Marla Lien reiterated that the motion made by Director Folska was a motion to amend Director Bagley’s motion.  She asked Director Solano to read the amendment as proposed by Director Folska so everyone was clear.

Motion to

Amend Substitute

Main Motion:              Director Folska made the motion to amend the substitute main motion back to the original Board Action language.

Director Solano read the amendment as follows:

“It is recommended by the operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors approves an 18.3 percent price increase for Business EcoPass and a 13.3 percent price increase for Neighborhood EcoPass.  These price increases are for 2016 contracts.  In addition, it is recommended that the current $2.50 DIA surcharge be eliminated for both Business EcoPass and Neighborhood EcoPass programs.”

Director Solano seconded the motion.

Marla Lien stressed that this was an amendment to the motion to approve Alternative 2 (substitute main motion).  If the Board votes yes they are voting to amend the motion to approve Alternative 2 (substitute main motion) and will then have to vote again on the motion to as amended.

Committee Chair Anderson suggested that the cleanest way to go back to staff’s recommendation would be to vote down Director Bagley’s motion and then make a new motion.  Director Folska pointed out that would not be correct protocol.  Director Folska already had a motion to amend Director Bagley’s motion that had been seconded, so the Board must vote on her motion to amend.

Director Menten inquired if more SmartCard tap data became available and it was determined that EcoPasses should really have a 25 percent increase, would the Board have any future options to adjust the pricing.  Bruce Abel explained that there is always the option for the Board to amend the pricing in any given year.  Marla Lien stated that the Board is not adopting a policy but the pricing for the EcoPasses for the 2016 year.  Once the contracts were signed the Board could not change the pricing for 2016 but would have the opportunity to do so in subsequent years.

Vote on Amendment to Substitute Main Motion:

Discussion:              Director Lubow believes this is about basic equity.  She does not want to see a Title VI issue and does not want to see EcoPass users get a larger subsidy than low-income riders; however, she is very concerned that the process used has not involved the stakeholders as much as it should.  She recognized that this was a thankless task for staff.

Director Francone agrees that there has not been enough time given to the community for their concerns to be heard.  She recognized the desire to have any Title VI inequities resolved quickly but she just does not believe there has been enough time to involve the community.  She requested the results of the survey that was sent to the EcoPass businesses prior to the Board Meeting.

Director Menten expressed concern that there was not enough time for the businesses to respond as they were sent out last Friday.

Director James believes that the Title VI concerns are great enough to warrant this vote but he too had heard concerns about the compressed process.

Director Bagley inquired if a vote on the EcoPass pricing could be delayed.  Interim General Manager Genova explained that if a vote was delayed it would be very difficult to get the 2016 EcoPass contracts out and executed.

Chair Sisk implored staff and the Board to review the EcoPass pricing over the next year as more SmartCard data became available and make any necessary changes based on the data.  He also hopes that the process can really involve the stakeholders.  He said he can assure everyone that an 18.3 percent increase will really take many businesses by surprised.  Bruce Abel stated that staff’s expectation is to continue the evaluation process and work with stakeholders through next years.

Director Hoy noted that one of the reasons RTD is in this situation is because we waited five years for a fare increase.  He suggested addressing this more frequently so increases would be easier to assimilate into budgets.

There was some discussion about the correct mover and seconder for the vote on this motion.  Marla Lien stated that since Director Folska amended the motion made by Director Bagley, Director Bagley was the mover.

Vote on Substitute Main Motion as Amended Back to Original Board Action Language:

##### a. RTD Pass Program Attachment A

##### b. Fare Study EcoPass Sept Ops Committee FINAL 090215

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors approves an 18.3 percent price increase for Business EcoPass and a 13.3 percent price increase for Neighborhood EcoPass. These price increases are for 2016 contracts. In addition, it is recommended that the current $2.50 DIA surcharge be eliminated for both the Business EcoPass and Neighborhood EcoPass programs.

#### 1. January 2016 Service Changes

Bruce Abel reminded the Board that RTD has three service changes per year.  He stressed that no action is being requested of the Board this evening.  Staff wants to ensure that the Board is briefed on the draft service changes that will be taken out to public comment.  He said that the Board will be presented with a final recommendation next month for approval.

Jessie Carter, Manager of Service Planning and Scheduling, noted that these changes would be happening in conjunction with the US 36 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Service Plan approved by the Board in July.  He highlighted the following more significant changes:

- Route L – add weekday mid-day service as well as Saturday service, which is grant funded

- Route 8 – extended to 114th and Huron due to growth in the area

- Route 79Ltd – renamed to Route 83D to better reflect its final destination in Downtown Denver

- Route 104X – as grant funding expires as of January. 2016 staff is proposing to incorporate this route into regular RTD services since it meets RTD Service Standards with the exception of the last northbound trip, which will be discontinued

Director Francone recognized that there had been many back-and-forth conversations about the Lockheed Martin Call-n-Ride being cancelled.  She asked for an update on the service.  Brian Matthews, Manager of Special Services, said that with the August service changes it was decided that RTD would keep one Call-n-Ride trip to, and one from, Lockheed Martin.  He indicated that it was too early for ridership data as the change has only been in effect for about three weeks.  Director Francone inquired if there had been significant conversations with Lockheed Martin about the need to increase ridership for this service to continue.  Brian Matthews stated that conversations had been taking place for about eight years.  Lockheed believes that there will be enough riders to warrant the service based on several new programs that just started such as an intern program.  Director Francone asked staff to analyze the ridership data for this Call-n-Ride very carefully.  She pointed out that while it is in her District, if ridership does not support the service then it should be cancelled.

Director Bagley supported the comments made by Director Francone.  He has been on the Board seven years and the Lockheed Martin Call-n-Ride has been a constant issue.  He feels that RTD has bent over backwards for this service but it has never achieved the ridership levels needed.

Director Solano asked for confirmation that Route 104X was being acclimated into regular service.  He also wondered if ridership was increasing for Route 145X.  Jessie Carter confirmed that staff is proposing Route 104X continues.  The route is doing very well and meeting RTD service standards with the exception of the last northbound route that staff is proposing be eliminated.  He stated that Route 145X’s ridership has not increased.  It is the lowest performing of all RTD’s express routes.  He said the market just is not there to support the service.  The current ridership is just above what we would expect to see for a suburban local route.

Chair Sisk asked why discontinuing the interline for the Sunday Route DASH would increase the cost.  Jessie carter explained that interlining is where a bus from one route that is finished is then turned into another route.  By discontinuing the interline it creates two bus pullouts from the garage instead of one, thereby increasing the cost.

Director Hoy pointed out that the route Director Solano inquired about, Route 145X, only runs twice a day.  He wonders if that is why ridership is so low.  Jessie Carter explained that the Route was not initially started as having only two trips; however, the other trips performed worse so it has been paired down.  The Route is not targeted toward peak airport times for airport employees.

Director Menten inquired as to the specific time when staff was proposing to discontinue evening and late night short-turn trips on Route 16.  Jessie Carter said it would start around 10:20 p.m.  He noted that it was not the entire Route that would be discontinued but the short-turn trips between Civic Center Station and Decatur-Federal Station.

##### a. Attachment A January 2016 Service Change revised

#### 2. ADA Expert Mid-Year Report

Bruce Abel commented that as the Board may recall, last year RTD entered into a settlement agreement with the Colorado Cross Disability Coalition (CCDC).  One of the requirements of the settlement was that RTD hire an ADA expert to review our performance in conforming to the obligations and commitments made in the settlement agreement.  He said that overall the report indicated that RTD is complying with the settlement agreement but did make some suggestions of best practices we should implement.

There were no questions from the Board.

#### 3. Mall Shuttle Vehicle Update (no back-up)

Bruce Abel thanked the Board again for their approval of the purchase of the new Mall Shuttles.  He said a pre-production meeting was scheduled for the last week of September.

Bruce Abel noted that there had been discussion regarding if RTD could apply for a grant through the Regional Air Quality Council (RAQC).  Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager for Planning, had a meeting with RAQC that was very positive.  Bruce Abel shared that while there were no commitments, it does appear the purchase of the Mall Shuttles would qualify.  He said that staff will continue to work to secure this funding.

Director James inquired as to when staff expected to have the new Mall Shuttles on the street.  Bruce Abel said that a pilot bus was expected in April or May with delivery of the entire fleet in October of 2016.

#### 4. Special Services 2nd Qtr 2015 Report

Director Hoy expressed his frustration that the data included in the Special Services report is not current enough.  It is already September and the data is from June.  Bruce Abel noted that it was the 2nd Quarter Report that covered April, May and June.

Director Francone asked for an update on the Evergreen Call-n-Ride.  Brian Matthews, Manager of Special Services, shared that Evergreen has formed a Transportation Advisory Committee (TAC).  The TAC has decided to focus on schools in the area and two senior living facilities to get ridership up.  He said he is waiting to hear back from drivers on their thoughts so far.  At this time it is too early to tell if there has been an increase in ridership as school just started.

### D. Other Matters

Director Lasater thanked everyone that had been involved with the Parker Call-n-Ride.  Parker has implemented a Transportation Advisory Committee that has been working on ideas to promote and bring awareness to the Call-n-Ride.  He thought it was very beneficial having the vehicles at the Parker Days Festival.  He pointed out that boardings have gone from about 2.7 per hour to 4.  He thinks it is great to see that things happen when you bring the community together.  He believes this is also what happened with the Federal Heights Call-n-Ride.  Director Lasater said this type of community engagement is what we need to do for our other Call-n-Rides.

Director James shared that recently the Rocky Mountain Institute held a competition related to driverless cars that the Directors should hear about in the news shortly.  He hopes RTD can take advantage of opportunities to be involved as this technological evolution takes place.

Director Menten remembered many years ago there being an experimental Personal Rapid Transit Track east of Denver.  She wondered if RTD ever owned that property and if so, does RTD still own it.  Interim General Manager Genova said he was familiar with the project but did not know if RTD had any involvement.  Director Bagley shared that he visited the facility when he was part of the Aurora Planning staff.  He does not believe RTD was involved.

### F. Adjourn

Committee Chair Anderson adjourned the meeting at 6:57 p.m.
