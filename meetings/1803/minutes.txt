Recommended Action
 Approval of a Contract for Construction for Centerpoint & Sable Bus Transfer
Center
Liz Rao, Assistant General Manager, Planning & Development, presented this
item. This project has been in the works for close to 20 years. This contract
meets the DBE goal of 18%.
It is recommended by the Planning & Development Committee that the RTD
Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or designee, to execute all
documents necessary to award a construction contract to Paramount
Construction in the amount of $1,498,708.24 for the Centrepoint & Sable Bus
Transfer Center in Aurora. Funds are currently programmed in the 2008 RTD
budget.

approval before the Board at the June 17,
2008 Board Meeting.

Second:

Director Martinez seconded the motion.

Vote on
Motion:

The Motion passed unanimously.

Approval of the Sale of 3,043 Square Feet of RTD Property at Colorado
Station
Susan Altes, Manager, Real Property spoke to this action. The recommended
action is to sell 3, 043 square feet of property that was acquired during the
TREX project. The developer is getting ready to construct a six story parking
structure and they need this parcel of property to complete the construction.
The developer is paying in cash and RTD will retain a permanent transit
easement on this property for a bus stop and passenger waiting area. The
development will enliven the area as there will be retail on the first floor of
the parking structure. Also, the developer will be responsible for the
maintenance of the bus stop and waiting area.
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board
of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to negotiate and
execute all documents necessary to sell 3,043 square feet of real property
located generally on Colorado Center Drive, City and County of Denver to
Lincoln ASB Colorado Center, LLC subject to RTD’s retention of a permanent
non-exclusive easement for transit purposes including a bus stop, pedestrian
access, and passenger boarding area. It is further recommended that the Board
of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to negotiate and
execute all documents that may be necessary for the cooperative design,
development and maintenance of the arcade design with parking above and
below the bus drop off area.

Motion:

Director Mcmullen made a motion for full
approval before the Board at the June 17,
2008 Board Meeting.

Second:

Director Brohl seconded the motion.

Discussion: Director Martinez asked if the parking at Colorado Station was

Summary of the Planning and Development Committee meeting held on Tuesday, June 10,

affected by this. Ms. Altes responded that it would not affect that as the
development is on the other side of the street. Director Daly asked where the
surplus money goes. Susan Altes responded that the money goes into the
general fund. Director Yamrick asked why the District was selling the
property when the market is so low. Ms. Altes responded that the developer
needs the property now. Cal Marsella said that this is a win-win situation for
the District in that they will maintain the site and actually improve the
experience for our transit riders.
Vote on
Motion:



The Motion passed unanimously.

Release of Rail Passenger Service Easement at Mississippi and Broadway,
City and County of Denver
Susan Altes spoke to this action. When the southwest corridor was built,
RTD acquired an operating easement from the Burlington Northern railroad.
With the redevelopment of the Gates site, the developer is putting in a new
Acoma street. The area where the street would be built is encumbered by
RTD’s operating easement. The street will not affect RTD’s rail operations in
any way. The developer is going to build security and access gates to the
District’s light rail line.
Director Chacon asked if there was a value in the easement; we paid
Burlington Northern for it so why are we releasing it? Cal Marsella said that
we did pay for it and used most of it and the rest of it is an uneconomic
remnant. The developer is making investments in the corridor which adds
value to the deal. This is supported by the City of Denver. Marla Lien added
that the easement granted to the District was just for rail operations. The
District could not build on this property, Burlington Northern did not give the
District any commercial rights in the easement.
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the
Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to
negotiate and execute all documents necessary to release a portion of the
Rail Passenger Service Easement on a parcel of vacant land near Mississippi
and Broadway, City and County of Denver containing an area of
approximately 48,479 square feet or 1.113 acres.
Motion:

Director Brohl made a motion for full
approval before the Board at the June 17,
2008 Board Meeting.

Second:

Director McMullen seconded the motion.

Motion:



The Motion passed unanimously.

Approval of the DUS Preliminary Design Intergovernmental Agreement
between RTD and CDOT
Liz Rao introduced this item. When SAFTEY-LU was passed a few years
ago, it included an earmark for Denver Union Station of $50 million on the
Federal Highway side. The District needs access to $5 million of that money
for preliminary engineering. The District can access the money through an
IGA with CDOT.
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the
RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to enter into an
Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) between the Colorado Department of
Transportation (CDOT) and the Regional Transportation District (RTD) for the
purpose of securing the first increment of the Federal Projects of National
and Regional Significance (PNRS) grant for Denver Union Station. The total
amount of the IGA is $5 million and includes both federal and RTD local
match for the Denver Union Station (DUS) preliminary engineering phase.
The 2008 funding plan for DUS assumes the receipt of the funds.



Motion:

Director Pulliam for full approval before the
Board at the June 17, 2008 Board Meeting.

Second:

Director Chacon seconded the motion.

Vote on
Motion:

The Motion passed unanimously.

Approval of West Corridor Budget Modification and Limited Notice to Proceed
Construction Contracts
Liz Rao spoke to this item and distributed a revised Board report. The revised
Board report is included in the Planning and Development Meeting Minute
Notebook for review. Cal Marsella gave an overview of the action. Staff is
requesting the Board’s authority to enter into a contract with the CMGC
(Construction Manager General Contractor) with a “not to exceed” price.
The price is $338.7 million. The total cost of the project does not change
but staff had to move $5 million out of the big contract to other
subcontractors.
The project cost is at $707.6 which is different than originally scoped. A
large amount of this increase is due to third party enhancements (paid for by
the requesting parties), monies already spent (required by the Federal

Summary of the Planning and Development Committee meeting held on Tuesday, June 10,
2008

Government), and an increase cost in materials. FTA is about to give the
District 18 million to the project to compensate for the rise in material cost.
The corridor is getting some money back from the cost savings of doing the
light rail maintenance facility at Elati instead of building a separate facility.
The savings is distributed among the corridors. The West corridor gets $12
million. A grade separation has been eliminated at 13th Street, and there
have been numerous deferments made in the contract to help with cost
containment.
This action:
- authorizes the District to enter into a contract and preliminary
engineering with the design team.
- Sets a guaranteed maximum price with the contractor of $338.7 million
- Establishes a budget of $707.6 million for the West Corridor Project
- Protects the “hold harmless” agreement for the other corridors.
Liz Rao clarified that at this time a full contract award would not be made.
Once the Federal Full Funding Grant agreement is received, a full contract
award will be given. Right now the District will give a limited notice to
proceed with task orders.
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the RTD
Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to take the following actions
in regard to the West Corridor cost, budget and scope and also provide the
General Manager or his designee with the authority to enter into a contract with
Denver Transit Construction Group (DTCG) (the Civil Contractor) and Balfour
Beatty (the LRT Systems Contractor) for the West Corridor Construction
contracts. Specifically the General Manger is authorized to:


Revise the West Corridor cost and funding from $634.7 million to $707.6
million due to additional dramatic cost spikes to the construction industry for
steel, concrete, copper, labor and fuel that are affecting bid prices for major
construction projects worldwide and creating a challenging cost climate
including the recommended reallocations as specified in the Financial Impact
section of the report.



Scope Changes- Proceed with scope deferments of approximately $ 28
million and prioritize restoring these items in the future in the event that
contingency funds are available prior to the completion of the West Corridor.
This is similar to the process we used for the Southwest and Southeast
Corridors. The current contingency line item budget is $ 39 million. This list
of scope reductions and deferments would meet our cost challenges while
maintaining essential elements of the transit project (See below).



Provide the General Manager or his designee with the authority to enter into
a contract with Denver Transit Construction Group (DTCG) (the Civil
Contractor) and Balfour Beatty (the LRT Systems Contractor) for the West

Summary of the Planning and Development Committee meeting held on Tuesday, June 10,

Corridor Construction contracts with a “Limited Notice-to-Proceed”. The
Limited Notice-to-Proceed will allow the DTCG GMP to be locked at $338.7
million and the Balfour Beatty GMP to be set at $62.6 million and shifts the
risk on future cost escalation to the contractors and up to approximately $5
million to the contingency and will allow initiation of limited performance
based on task orders to be issued by staff and paid out of currently
budgeted, authorized on appropriated West Corridor funds. Notice-toProceed under the full scope of the GMP for both contractors will be made
contingent upon the receipt and approval of the Full Funding Grant
Agreement (FFGA) by the RTD Board of Directors and will require a
subsequent Board action and contract amendment. Task orders will be
issued to keep this project on schedule.
Director Yamrick asked why she should approve this contract because she
felt cost cutting measures have not been fully studied. Cal Marsella
responded that David Evans and Associates and Stacey Whitback and
Associates/Herzog have been meeting for quite a while to work on cost
mitigation. Many items have been moved out of the contract and into
contingencies.
Director Martinez reminded the Committee that the West Corridor comes out
of the FasTracks budget and not RTD’s general budget.
Director Tayer wanted to know what constitutes fair distribution or savings.

passed.



Approval of Federal Center Transit Oriented Development Agreement – Liz
Rao, Bill Sirois, Susan Altes spoke to the recommended action.
The District went out for a RFP and has been in discussion with Aardex to
negotiate conceptual design. 15.5 acres are owned by the district, the
District is selling 10 acres to Aardex for $3.3 million dollars and they will

Summary of the Planning and Development Committee meeting held on Tuesday, June 10,

build the 1,000 car parking facility and 16 bus bay transfer facility. RTD will
have input on the design and construction. This agreement will save RTD
$2.5 million on construction of the parking facility and street improvements.
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board
of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to negotiate and
execute all documents necessary for the development of a minimum 1000
space parking structure, a 16 bay bus transfer facility, pedestrian connections
and plazas, and various street, access and infrastructure improvements to be
designed and built by Aardex LLC with a financial contribution from RTD in the
amount of $12.609 million, the successful proposer on RFP #17-FH-004 and to
transfer the ownership of approximately 10 acres of vacant land owned by RTD
to Aardex, LLC. It is further recommended that the Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager or his designee to negotiate and execute all documents
that may be necessary for the cooperative design, development and
maintenance of the parking structure. Funds to cover these costs are included in
the 2008 Adopted Budget and the FasTracks Financial Plan.
Director Daly asked if the bus pull in would be covered. The response was yes.
Director Daly asked about exhaust. The parking structure will be designed for
ventilation per building codes.

Board Meeting.

Second:

Director Martinez seconded the motion.

Vote on
Motion:

The Motion passed unanimously.

Approval of Contract Amendment with David Evans and Associates – Liz Rao
spoke to this action. This is to take the construction documents from 90%
to the conformed set for issue for construction. The Board report listed Front
Range systems in the title but Ms. Rao said that was erroneous and the
action was for David Evans and Associates only.
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the RTD
Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designees to execute all
documents necessary to award and implement a contract amendment to David
Evans and Associates (DEA) for $7.6 million for services needed to bring the
construction documents from 90% to a conformed set for issue to the
contractor and for design services during construction. The total DEA contract
value after this amendment will be $29 million. Funds are included in the 2008
budget for the West Corridor.
