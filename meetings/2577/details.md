##### a. 2017 Resolution - 001 Appointment of Pension Trustees

#### A. Salaried Employee DB Pension Plan

Wendy Londa of Rael and Letson reported on the state of the salaried employee pension plan.

She presented the following information:

- The total participant count decreased by 14 (from 701 to 687)

- The plan closed to new participants on January 1, 2008

- The active population decreased from 361 to 327

- The plan’s actuarial accrued liability increased by $11.3M (from $146.5M to $157.8M)

- The actuarial value of assets increased by $2.7M (from $120.9M to $123.6M)

- The unfunded actuarial accrued liability increased by $8.6M (from $25.6M to $34.2M)

- The funded ratio based on the actuarial value of assets decreased from 82.5% to 78.3%

- The funded ratio based on the market value of assets decreased from 88.7% to 77.8%

- The recommended contribution increased by $0.8M from $6.8M to $7.6M

Wendy Londa stated that, effective in 2016, the Board’s funding policy changed from recommending a set contribution amount to an amount that was “actuarially sound” based on recommendations of the actuary and RTD’s Chief Financial Officer. Based on the investment return of -.5% in 2015, and with a funding assumption of $4.1 million and assuming all funding assumptions were met each year, she stated the fund would be 100% funded by 2043. She noted that the higher contribution in 2016 offset the plan losses in 2015. She commented that, due to the plan being closed to new participants and decreasing in size, future investment returns have a significant impact on the plan’s projected liabilities.

She said that her firm would continue to monitor funding levels, recommended contribution amounts, methodologies, and the policies of other public pension systems and continue to report to the Board annually.

##### a. RTD 2017 Salaried Penion Plan Report 02-14-17

#### B. Represented Employee DB Plan

Leslie Thompson, Gabriel Roeder Smith & Company, reported that the pension plan for represented employees is in funding peril. She said that contributions were not sufficient to offset liabilities and that fully funding the plan going forward would require a 29% total payroll contribution, up from the 18% currently contributed, and that the amount needed is increasing each year. She said that, at current funding levels, the fund is expected to be out of money by 2035, whereas last year the fund was projected to run out in 2039. She said that the current assumption for returns on investment is at 7% annually; at a realized 6% annual rate of return, the fund would be depleted by 2033. She said that the accrued liability of the fund increased $9 million to a total of $436 million and the annual rate of asset returns was 4.77%, short of the 7% assumed annual rate. She said that paying off the plan immediately would require a lump-sum payment of $224 million. She noted that the benefits offered to new hires are not as generous as those granted to previous hires and that the costs associated with new plan members were much less expensive.

Leslie Thompson stated that the last time the plan was fully funded was in 2002 and that the funded ratio degraded over time, to a low of 48.5% in 2016. She said that in 2002 over 100% of the required contribution was made and since then the ratio has dropped and currently hovers around 50%; in comparison, she said the average percentage in the public sector is in the 70s. She noted that reforms were made to the bargaining agreement, such as Amendment 22, which significantly reduced benefits and changed the vesting requirements, retirement age, and maximum years of service of those hired after January 2011. She said that the unfunded liability accrued for employees hired before that date is significant. She said that, at the current rate, $40 million in annual benefit payments are required if all benefits are to continue to be paid. She mentioned that she did not know if it is legally possible to decrease benefits to retirees. She stated that the only way to save the plan would be through additional contributions.

Director Broom asked whether employees pay social security, and Leslie Thompson confirmed that they do.

Director Tisdale stated that the salaried pension plan annual rate of return for 2016 was 9.4% and asked for the rate of return for the represented plan.

Leslie Thompson said the she was not aware of the rate for 2016, but for 2015 it was -.86%, a rate similar to that of the salaried pension plan over the same year.

Director Lubow asked who was responsible for making up the shortfall.

Leslie Thompson said the answer to that question was not within her purview.

Director Lubow then asked why the funding levels decreased after 2002.

Leslie Thompson stated that the funding contributions were negotiated and the liabilities increased due to pension plan improvements.

Heather McKillop stated that the benefits increased after 2002 and that contributions did not keep pace, which meant that the funding gap widened.

General Manager Genova said the trust increased their multiplier at that time as well, which improved the benefit, but the contributions remained the same.

Leslie Thompson said financial meltdowns in 2008 and 2009 were also a factor. She said it is difficult for negotiated pension trusts to respond quickly to financial meltdowns.

Director Sisk asked whether the union was aware of the situation, to which General Manager Genova said yes. Director Sisk went on to say that the Board had heard the same presentation last year and the outlook had not improved. He said that RTD owes it to the union to help correct this drastic situation, as the employees are the agency’s most valuable asset. He said it would be hard to say to the newer employees that the vested employees need to be taken care of when the contract is renegotiated in 2018. He asked whether the prior pension had better return on investments.

Heather McKillop stated that the annual rate of return for 2015 was -.5%, with the rate of return for the salaried plan running about the same. She said that the salaried employee plan investment pool is quite different from the represented pool. She said that investment returns were not good in 2015. She stated that RTD has a systemically different plan from the represented plan structure and that RTD took a different approach from the union by putting new employees on the defined contribution plan, which was created in 2008. She said that the two plans need to be dealt with in different ways.

General Manager Genova said a different trust manages the represented employee plan, with three trustees from the union and three from RTD management, and their decisions are based on consensus.

Director Deadwyler asked if the contract could be opened to amendment prior to the five-year renegotiation period.

General Manager Genova said RTD and the union are getting ready to renegotiate next year.

Director Deadwyler asked whether the represented pension plan would be renegotiated at that time.

General Manager Genova said that the pension plan would be one of the primary discussion points.

Director Deadwyler asked whether the union also makes contributions to the pension plan

General Manager Genova said that the union employees do contribute an agreed upon amount.

Director Deadwyler asked why RTD was not asking for more contributions from the union since the plan is in jeopardy.

General Manager Genova said the contributions come from employees or from RTD and that the union does not contribute directly.

Director Solano inquired as to the average age of an RTD pensioner, which Leslie Thompson said she could not immediately recall. Director Solano said that the situation looks bad for new hires, which Ms. Thompson.

Heather McKillop said the benefit multiplier had been reduced to 1%, down from 2.5%, which was needed to stabilize the plan.

Leslie Thompson, answering Director Solano’s earlier question, said that there are currently 1221 union pensioners, their average age is 75, and that their average benefit payout is $1,500 per month.

Director Williams asked if any recommended Board action would result from the presentation.

General Manager Genova said that the represented employee trust manages the fund and that, unlike the salaried pension fund, the recommendations do not come before the Board.

Director Williams said that the Board can see what is going on but cannot act.

General Manager Genova responded that, other than through participation of RTD management employees on the pension trust board, the Board could not intervene.

Heather McKillop said that the pension fund would be discussed during the collective bargaining agreement negotiation cycle. She said that there is no opportunity to make changes to the plan during the five-year contract window.

General Manager Genova said that the trustees could make certain plan changes.

Director Williams asked whether the same presentation would be given to the represented plan trustees, and General Manager Genova said that it would and at a much deeper level.

Chair Hoy said that the vesting period had been adjusted from five years to ten and said that doing so seemed like a prudent move. He asked whether there is a typical vesting period.

Leslie Thompson said that she had never seen a vesting period longer than ten years and that the length of a vesting period depends on how much peril the given plan is in. She said that the most common vesting period is five years and specified that any contributions made by employees are always entirely theirs.

Director Broom said that RTD issues debt and that the debt carries an assigned rating. He asked what rating agencies say about the debt rating for the pension funding for the District.

Heather McKillop said the ratings agencies ask a lot of questions because RTD is liable for the salaried plans and the numbers are included in the RTD’s ledgers as mandatory financial disclosures. She said that, for the represented pension plans, RTD is only liable for the 13% agency contribution, even though the $244 million liability appears on the books.

Director Anderson asked whether the represented employee pension fund is tied to their health and welfare plan. She recalled that there was a recent issue with the Represented employees’ health benefits.

Leslie Thompson said that the health and welfare plan is entirely separate from the pension plan.

Heather McKillop said that there were some issues with the health and welfare plan. She said that RTD upped contributions in 2016 and that the plan seems to be doing well at this time. She confirmed that the health and welfare plan is an entirely separate plan even though it has the same trustees.

Director Anderson said that RTD needs employees and that the contract negotiators would have to consider the taxpayers’ ability to pay for pension plans. She said that pension plans have changed drastically throughout the business of the business world and that currently companies offer IRA’s or other similar plans. She concluded by saying the funding gap is serious though it is nothing the Board can fix.

Director Deadwyler recalled that the union employees did not receive a raise for three years and asked whether the employee contribution amount of 5% would be the increased following a salary increase.

General Manager Genova said that the employees did not see a wage increase in 2013 or 2014 though they were paid a bonus that was nearly equal to the amount the wages would have increased. He said they did receive pay increases in 2015, 2016, and 2017.

Director Deadwyler asked whether higher salaries would result in larger pension fund contributions.

General Manager Genova said that both RTD and employee contribution amounts would increase slightly as a result of a pay raise.

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, said that the previous pay increase did result in an in the contributions by both RTD and the covered employees.

Director Lubow questioned whether, considering the drastic reduction in plan valuation after 2002 because of a variety of factors, the renegotiated contract could include a provision to trigger a pension plan renegotiation in light of financial emergencies.

General Manager Genova said renegotiating in the middle of a contract would be complicated because of both the collective bargaining agreement and the trust. He said the trust controls the plan and any changes to the plan. He stated that the idea could be discussed though the trust would have the final say.

Director Lubow said that it would be good to have the flexibility to adapt to changing circumstances.

General Manager Genova said the trust meets frequently and that many people are involved but stated that the trust has not come to an agreement since the change to the plan structure in 2010 or 2011.

Bruce Abel said that he and Doug MacLeod, RTD’s Controller, were two of the plan trustees and that trust receives a lot of conversation. He said that the trust was one of the top issues at the bargaining table during the last collective bargaining agreement discussions. He said that, with quarterly meetings and other frequent ad hoc meetings, the trust is discussed regularly.

Committee Chair Menten said it was her impression that the union is unaware of the funding situation and asked Bruce Abel to confirm whether that impression was accurate.

Bruce Abel said that, with 2700 union employees, there will be a wide variance people’s understanding of the state of the trust. He said it would not be appropriate for RTD to communicate directly with those employees regarding the trust.

Director Menten concurred with Chair Hoy that private sector pensions are rare. She clarified that the Directors should not attend represented employee pension trust meetings, and Bruce Abel and Rolf Asphaug both agreed.

##### a. ATU_RTD BigBoard Presentation 2016

#### C. General Manager Contract Review

Cheryl Wallace, audit partner with Rubin Brown, presented an independent review of the General Manager’s contract agreement. She said the estimated salary in 2016 was $336,000 and $332,000 was actually paid. She said the difference between those amounts was due to the budgeted reimbursement of legal fees which were not requested. She said that the revised salary estimate for 2017 is $344,000 and that one column had been added to the contract review regarding discretionary bonus payments.

##### a. RTD 2017 Report on Cost of GM Contract FINAL

#### D. December 2016 Monthly Financial Status Report

Doug MacLeod, Controller, presented the December 2016 financial review. He said that the final numbers were undergoing an audit with Ruben Brown. He stated that the final audited figures would be available in May, though the sales and use tax accrual, ridership numbers, and fare revenue were final as of the presentation. He said that December is typically a good revenue month and that this December’s sales and use tax month returns were RTD’s highest ever at $55 million, though that figure was .9% below projections. He said that, while the total revenue for 2016 was $6.166 million below projections, the total revenue figure was much higher than any year before, $22 million more than in 2015. He said that RTD was subject to two fairly large tax refunds during the year totaling $3.2 million, which accounts for more than half of the $6 million projection shortfall. He also said that ridership decreased by 1.7 million last year to a total of 101.3 million riders using both revenue and non-revenue services. He said that some of the decline in ridership could be accounted for in the opening of the University of Colorado A Line. He further stated that annual fare revenue increased by $4 million despite the decline in ridership.

Doug MacLeod reminded the Board of the 12% fare increase in 2016 and noted that there was an 11% increase year-over-year in dollars collected, some of which increase may be attributable to the $9 cost of a ticket on the University of Colorado A Line. He noted there has been a shift purchasing, as more day passes and fewer 10-ride passes have been sold. He said that with so many factors to take into consideration it is difficult to pinpoint the reason for the ridership decline. He said that increased fare revenue helped to offset ridership drop.

Heather McKillop said that 2017 would be a volatile year and that she was pleased that the actual revenues came within $2 million of the projected figures of $700 million especially with so many changes overall. She said that she hoped to see lower annual expenditures for the past year once the books were closed and will report on the final numbers once the audit is completed.

General Manager Genova said ridership was a topic of discussion at the recent APTA CEO conference. He learned that there had been a decrease in ridership across the nation last year, with an increase only in certain types of services. He said that the attendees offered no solutions or guesses as to why that trend is happening but stated that RTD’s ridership decline seems average among the other transit agencies.

Director Deadwyler asked for more information on the refunds mentioned by Doug MacLeod.

Doug MacLeod said that he would not be able to disclose certain things but mentioned that a telecom company won a dispute over $2 million in tax payments and that the other refund was over $700,000. He said that RTD receives tax assessments from the Department of Revenue automatically and frequently and that these adjustments were larger than usual.

Director Lubow asked whether the fare increase had placed the fare at a point beyond which riders were willing to pay.

Heather McKillop said that it would be easier to determine whether the fare increases were causing the ridership decline if it had been the only systemic change. However, she said that, with three new lines and changes in fare structures, pinning the reason behind the decline to a single cause would be difficult. She said that some information could possibly be gained by correlating statistical information with fare increase and would report back to the Board.

General Manager Genova pointed out that changes in zone structure could also be a factor.

Director Lubow asked whether a rider survey had been conducted.

General Manager Genova said yes and noted that, when the economy is good and gas is reasonably priced, people make convenience choices.

Director Broom said he had read that an increase in fares results in a 5% loss of ridership and that previous level of ridership takes time to restore.

Doug MacLeod said that RTD adjust fares once every 3 years. He said that, in reviewing a number of previous fare increase years, RTD experienced a ridership increase in every year except one. He said there may be a point of elasticity at which people will not pay more but offered to look into the question.

Director Solano said a newspaper article stated Denver has a larger immigrant population than other major cities and asked whether staff had taken into consideration the impact of an immigrant ban.

General Manager Genova said RTD would not be getting involved in those politics. He said that some agencies, like Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) and other agencies that service sanctuary cities are discussing the potential impacts.

Director Solano said he has heard from civil rights attorneys that sting operations are already underway in Denver and suggested that RTD adopt a proactive contingency plan for the agency.

Director Tisdale said that, with fare increase of 10% and a drop in gas prices of 10% on a month-to-month basis year over year, a 1.6% drop in ridership does not sound like a shocking number. He suggested that RTD might have budgeted aggressively but suggested the 1.6% decline could be attributable to the price of gas.

Chair Hoy said that reviewing fare increases and reduced ridership would render a picture of what is happening in Denver but noted that ridership is down nationwide and that not every transit agency had a fare increase last year. He said he suspects the ridership decline to be a national issue and suggested that gas prices, the economy, employment levels may play a role not necessarily related to the 2016 fare increase. He said that RTD changed so many things last year system-wide that there has been a dynamic change in how the agency collect fares.

Director Deadwyler said that her constituents are saying they are not using RTD services because of cost of parking. She said that, when adding the cost of parking into consideration, RTD services are not cost effective for them.

##### a. 123116 MFS

#### E. Quarterly Investment Report

Brenden Morgan, Manager of Debt and Investments, gave the quarterly investment report. He said the fourth quarter was interesting because federal reserve increased rates by .25% and that, as interest rates rise, the value of bonds goes down. He said that the value of RTD’s assets experienced a slight decrease and that the fund performance is reflected in the balance sheet. He stated that RTD’s investment goal is to mimic the performance of certain benchmarks and that the agency continues to be in line with those trends.

##### a. INVESTMENT REPORT DEC 2016

#### F. SmartCard Project Update

Tonya Anderson, Electronic Fare Operations Manager, reported that the Retail Point of Sale system located at King Soopers and Safeway stores underwent the first live test on February 1. She said that pilot participants made nine transactions totaling $325 during a two-week period. She said that King Soopers’ kiosk went live first and that Safeway would go live any day. She said that RTD is working on training the store manager at a second store and that three stores will be participating by next month.

She stated that Conduent, the SmartCard project contractor, had completed remediation on two of the three issues identified during the nine-week testing period. She said her team was verifying Conduent’s proposed fixes.

Heather McKillop said May 10, 2017, would be the go live date for the stored value cards in the pilot King Soopers store. She said that 2,000 pilot users would be participating in the trial and that the pilot program would go live to the public on May 24, 2017. She stated the project team has been testing and that Conduent has been cooperating in order to fix any problems before the go live date.

Director Menten said that the King Soopers store is located at Colfax Speer and asked the location of the others.

Heather McKillop said the other locations were both Safeway stores and that one was at Alameda and Broadway and the other at Colfax and Garrison.

Chair Hoy asked whether the changeover from Xerox to Conduent was the reason for the recent progress.

Heather McKillop said she was not sure of the reason but speculated the new project manager may have had an impact. She said that the project now had momentum and was happy for the progress regardless of the cause.

Director Broom asked whether the SmartCards could be loaded with credit or cash and whether the stores are compensated on a per transaction basis.

Heather McKillop said that the cards could be loaded either by cash or credit and that eventually vendors would receive 1.25% of the total amount of the transactions. She said that currently the participating stores do not receive any fee.

Director Williams asked whether any data collection was being performed with respect to the users of the SmartCards.

Heather McKillop said yes but noted that one of the areas where RTD could not regularly collect information was on trains. She said bus riders could not board a bus without tapping and that commuter rail passengers are checked regularly. She said RTD is working on new and improved ways of checking SmartCards as well as Eco and College Passes.

Director Williams stated that RTD should partner with the firm that posts seatbelt advertisements to raise awareness.

General Manager Genova said a fare enforcement report would be presented at the next meeting. He said that San Diego started its own SmartCard project in 2003 and that the city still does not have a stored value product. He stated that San Diego uses a different provider, Cubic, which is big player in the market.

Director Deadwyler said her constituents have complained about the location of validators and asked whether they could be moved to a different location.

Heather McKillop said she assumed the validators were located close to electrical conduits but offered to find out more.

General Manager Genova said that certain places on the platforms have a natural flow and that platform areas are so large that the location of validators might not be convenient for everyone.

Director Deadwyler said that the Dallas and Portland transit agencies have the validators on the platforms themselves.

Director Solano asked whether fare evasion was factored into the budget.

General Manager Genova said that fare evasion numbers would be given in the next presentation but that fare evasion was not factored into budgeting.

#### G. NextRide and Trip Planner Demonstration

Tiffany Angel, Manager of Digital Communications, and Rahul Sood, Manager of Software Architecture and Development, spoke about the RTD-created NextRide and Trip Planner transit applications.

Tiffany Angel said that RTD publically released transit data for use by third parties and that doing so was a good way to push out RTD-related information at no cost to the agency. She said that eight third-party applications currently use RTD data and that her team works closely with the creators of TransitApp, an application used by 20,000 riders each month. She said that RTD had recently launched location data for buses and that the IT staff was working to do the same for light rail. She said the location data for commuter rail service could not go forward without negotiations with Denver Transit Partners (DTP).

Tiffany Angel said that the NextRide application launched December 21, 2016, on the RTD website. She said the RTD website itself received 16.5 million hits and 40 million page views annually, with 70% of traffic coming from mobile devices. She said that Next Ride offered real time information on bus location. She said a multifaceted marketing campaign would be rolling out in March to promote Next Ride. She said the other product launched recently was Trip Planner, which now gives both RTD customer care agents and customers a similar interface, thereby improving customer service. She said Trip Planner features real-time arrival and departure times for buses.

Director Williams asked if RTD would be demonstrating the applications in colleges and schools.

Tiffany Angel said she had not considered doing so but would take the idea back to her team. She said the team had provided demonstrations via GoToMeeting and would be able to tape those demonstrations and make them available online.

Director Williams said that local transportation organizations are always seeking presenters.

Tiffany Angel said her team has been in touch with the City of Boulder, which just received a relevant grant for $70,000 and wants to help promote the applications using that money.

Director Williams said that many of the organizations she works with outside of RTD would want to promote these products and asked to speak to her offline.

Director Walker mentioned that one of the applications he uses shows bike share locations.

Tiffany Angel said that bike share information was not yet available on the NextRide and Trip Planner applications.

Rahul Sood said that his team was working with the Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) to add a layer to the applications for bike share locations.

Director Walker asked whether Zipcar locations were also displayed.

Rahul Sood said that information was not incorporated yet.

Tiffany Angel said that bike travel information would be included, as well as special event services, following a second wave of funding that would allow her team to expand the offerings in 2018.

Director Walker said that Uber had been collecting transit information, though the company does not share it readily.

Rahul Sood said he recently attended an OpenTripPlanner meeting, which is an open-source platform for multi-modal and multi-agency journey planning. He said that RTD has access through that platform to data gathered by third parties.

Director Tisdale asked whether standalone mobile applications would be released for NextRide and Trip Planner

Tiffany Angel said her team was looking into mobile applications. She said spending money is difficult to justify when third parties create applications for free.

Chair Hoy asked for an explanation as to whether a mobile application would be preferable to browser-based application.

Tifanny Angel said the decision is about packaging. She said people like to download apps and to have home screen icons. She stated that using NextRide and Trip Planner via browser on a mobile device would give the user the same experience as though they were launched via a mobile application. She further stated that an application could deliver push notifications, which would not be available on a browser.

Rahul Hood said that one of the benefits of a browser-based application is that multiple phone versions need not be developed.

### D. Other Matters

Committee Chair Menten mentioned the fare changes implemented in 2016 were not all increases and that certain changes in fare resulted in cheaper passes.

### F. Adjourn

Committee Chair Menten adjourned the meeting at 7:30 p.m.
