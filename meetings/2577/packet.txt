RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the attached Resolution No. ______ appointing Directors Bob Broom, and reappointing Director
Judy Lubow and employees Luong (Lou) Ha and Sylvia Francis, to terms expiring 12/31/2018 as
trustees for the Salaried Employee Defined Benefit (i.e., Pension) Plan and Salaried Employee Defined
Contribution Plan.
BACKGROUND
On August 16, 2016, the Board approved amendments to the above Plans to provide for appointment of
the same four employee trustees for each of the plans, with two trustees being employee participants in
the Pension Plan, and two being employee participants in the Defined Contribution Plan, with termination
dates to provide for staggered terms. The terms of former Director Tom Tobiassen, current Director Judy
Lubow, and the above employees have expired 12/31/16. Reappointment of the above existing trustees
and appointment of Director Bob Broom to replace Mr. Tobiassen for terms ending 12/31/18 is
recommended.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action and approve Bob Broom, Judy Lubow, Luong (Lou) Ha and
Sylvia Francis to serve as trustees on the Plans in accordance with the attached resolution. This
is recommended because the vacant positions need to be filled. In accordance with prior Board
resolutions, the two employees were previously screened for the positions and have served
capably.
2. Reject the Recommended Action and the attached resolution, and require a revised
recommendation. This is not recommended since the positions are currently vacant.

January 1, 2016 Valuation Highlights

1.C.A.a

 Effective with the 2016 Fiscal Year, the Board’s funding policy was changed from
contributing the recommended contribution (up to an annual maximum of $3.1 million) to

contributing an amount to keep the Trust “actuarially sound” based on the
recommendations of the Actuary and RTD’s Chief Financial Officer

 The change in funding policy was considered a more prudent approach towards achieving the
Plan’s 100% funding target over a reasonable period

 Last year, based on January 1, 2015 actuarial valuation results and a 2015 net
investment return of -0.5%, the Plan was projected to reach 100% funding in 2043 with a
$4.1M contribution each year assuming all assumptions were met in the future

 Based on the January 1, 2016 actuarial valuation results and a 2015 net investment
return of -0.5%, the Plan was not projected to reach 100% funding assuming a $4.1M
contribution each year and all assumptions were met in the future

Long-Term Funding

1.C.A.a

 What changed since last year?
 The Plan experienced a $4.5M salary loss in 2015 (10.2% average salary increase for
continuing actives compared to an expected weighted average increase of 5.0%)

 The investment return in 2016 exceeded the 7.50% assumption – the investment consultant
estimates a net return of 9.4% for 2016

 The Board approved a $4.6M contribution for the 2017 Fiscal Year; the actuary’s recommended
contribution was $7.6M

 Reflecting January 1, 2016 valuation results, a 9.4% net return on assets for 2016, and a
$4.6M contribution for 2017, if all actuarial assumptions are met each year, including a
net investment return of 7.5% per year beginning in 2017:

 If future contributions are equal to $4.6M, the funding level will remain fairly stable near 80%
with recommended contributions steadily rising as the amortization period declines; the Plan is
projected to achieve 100% funding in 2043 (same as last year)

 If the recommended contribution is made beginning in 2018, the recommended amount will
continue to drop with 100% funding achieved in 2031 and the recommended amount dropping
below $4.6M by the 2029 Fiscal Year

 The recommended contribution ranges from $7.3M in 2018 down to $3.4M in 2031

Long-Term Funding (Continued)

1.C.A.a

 Due to the Plan’s size and nature, future investment returns have a significant impact on
projected liabilities – we will keep the Board apprised of the impact of the Plan’s
investment performance on future costs

• Reflects a $4.1 million contribution in 2016
and a $4.6 million contribution in 2017.
• Assets reflect an estimated market rate of
return of 9.40%, net of investment expenses,
in 2016, and assumes a market rate of return
of 7.50%, net of investment expenses, in
each future year thereafter.
• Assumes all other assumptions are met in
2016 and each future year.

prior year was 2036

► Assuming 6% earnings the depletion date is 2033

 The ADC as a dollar amount stayed about the same
► There were gains due to anticipated lower benefits than expected and due to new hires

having a lower normal cost;

► There were losses due to contributions less than the ADC and investment earnings less than

assumed

► These two sources offset each other

RTD/ATU Summary
 Pension reform (Amendment #22) is decreasing the normal cost but the

unfunded is “outrunning” the solution
► Decrease in the normal cost while UAL payments grow faster
► Trust depletion date moved from 2039 to 2035 (4 years closer)
• This is a highly volatile calculation; one year of poor returns could bring that number much closer to
today
• At depletion in 2035, benefit payments are estimated at $40 million per year which is approximately
30% of projected payroll
► Asset losses (investments not meeting the assumed 7%) continue to increase the unfunded

accrued liability
•

There are $9.2 million in deferred market losses still to be recognized

► Contribution shortfalls also continue to increase the unfunded accrued liability

Attachment: RTD 2017 Report on Cost of GM Contract FINAL (3053 : General Manager Contract Review)

Assumptions used in calculating the estimated cost of the Contract:

1.C.C.a

Board of Directors
Regional Transportation District
Page 3

1. Salary and benefit costs were agreed to payroll records.
2. Benefit costs under this Contract are the same as those provided for all salaried
employees under the benefit plans.
The 2016 actual paid amounts were below the original estimate. This is primarily due
to $4,000 of planned legal reimbursements that were not paid.
The revised estimated annual amounts for 2017 through 2021 were adjusted for the
following:
1. Updated for Social Security and Medicare tax rates for 2017, with estimated
annual increases of $500 per year through 2020
2. Updated wage limits (Section 401(a)(17)) related to pension contributions for
2017, with estimated annual increases of $5,000 per year, which translates into
estimated additional pension contributions of $450 per year through 2020
3. A payment of a potential discretionary performance payment of $31,500 (10% of
prior-year’s base salary) that would be paid in 2021 for performance in 2020 was
not included in the original estimate and has been added to both the original and
revised estimates above.
We were not engaged to, and did not, conduct an examination, the objective of which
would be the expression of an opinion on the specified elements, accounts or items.
Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. Had we performed additional
procedures, other matters might have come to our attention that would have been
reported to you.
This report is intended solely for the information and use of the specified users listed
above and is not intended to be, and should not be, used by anyone other than these
specified parties.

INFORMATION
Please find the District’s investment report for the fourth quarter of 2016 attached.
On December 15, 2016, the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee announced that it would increase
short term interest rates by 0.25%, into the range of 0.50% to 0.75% from the range of 0.25% to
0.50%. The committee recently noted that “the labor market has continued to strengthen and that
economic activity has continued to expand at a moderate pace” and that “inflation increased in recent
quarters but is still below the Committee’s 2 percent objective.” Consistent with its statutory mandate,
the Committee seeks to maintain maximum employment and price stability.
The impact to the bond market was as expected in that as interest rates rose, the value of existing
bonds fell because newly issued bonds now have higher interest rates. This relationship between bond
yield and bond price is demonstrated in the following graphic:

The decrease in value of existing bonds will be reflected in RTD’s financial statements as of
12/31/2016, however since RTD generally holds bonds that it owns until maturity, actual losses are not
expected to be realized. The decrease in value is also reflected in the total return (yield plus change in
value) performance of RTD’s investments and their correlating benchmarks.
The District’s Investment Policy (the “Policy”) is conservative in nature and seeks to satisfy the three
primary objectives of: safety, liquidity and yield, in that order of importance.
The Policy specifies that:
“Quarterly reports shall outline the District’s total investment return and compare the portfolio’s
performance to a publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics
to the portfolio or sub-portfolio being measured. For the liquidity tier of the portfolio (cash and cash
equivalents), the specified index shall be the 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index as published by Bank of
America Merrill Lynch for the period being measured. For the enhanced cash portion of the portfolio

Packet Pg. 40

1.C.E

(securities maturing between 90 days and 5 years and with a target duration of 1 year), the designated
performance benchmark will be the Merrill Lynch 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.”
The total return on the liquidity and enhanced cash tiers of the District’s unrestricted portfolio and
investment benchmarks were as follows:

The yield of the District’s unrestricted portfolio through 2016 was 0.80% which produced earnings of
$1,550,837. The current yield for the month of December was 0.87% which would produce annualized
earnings of $1,453,796. Historical performance of RTD investments relative to the Investment Policy
benchmarks is reflected in the following graphs:

Board Meeting Date: February 14, 2017
Information

The Smart Card Program is an Electronic Fare Collection and Payment System designed to increase fare
payment convenience for our customers, reduce and optimize fare collection costs for the agency and
reduce fraud associated with paper based fare media. The contract was signed with Xerox Transport
Solutions, Inc. in mid-2010.
The Smart Card Program launched to EcoPass, CollegePass and Neighborhood EcoPass customers on
January 1, 2013. There are approximately 475,000 active cards in circulation. During the month of
January 2017, 1.27M taps were recorded.
Starting the morning of Monday January 4, 2016 MyRide Stored Value cards were dispersed to the
public pilot program participants at the RTD retail outlets. As of January 1, 2017, approximately 1,950
cards were issued, of which 1,540 (79%) were full fare cards and 410 (21%) were discount cards.
The average stored value loaded (initial purchases and reloads) was $48, with a total value loaded of
$362,000. There were 134,000 boardings using these MyRide cards with a fare payment value of
$296,000. Of these boardings; 70% were local, 28% regional and 2% airport.
The Stored Value MyRide Card is a product that can be purchased by the general public currently
enrolled in the public pilot program to pay for transit fares on fixed route buses and rail platforms. Stored
Value is provided on reloadable plastic cards. These cards can be loaded with certain dollar amounts and
used much like a gift card. Once the card is loaded, it can be used to board bus or rail until the dollar
amount on the card is less than the fare needed. Additional value can be loaded onto the card at RTD
sales outlets.
All bus installations are complete for operational service. Additional validators will be installed as buses
are purchased.
Additional platform validators were installed for the University of Colorado A Line and the B Line to
Westminster. More platform validators will be installed on the G Line to Wheat Ridge and the R Line to
Aurora. 191 Light and Commuter Rail platform validators have been installed and are operational.
As of January 1, 2017, Xerox Transport Solutions, Inc. separated its Business Process Services Unit into
an independent public company called Conduent. Xerox will be referred to as Conduent.

some of these cards in March 2016
which yielded positive results.
Challenges continue to remain and for
this reason, the status is shown as
yellow.
