FFGA Funding for the EAGLE P3
• FTA’s FY2014 New Starts / Small Starts budget
includes $2.1 billion in project commitments
• Absent a budget deal that replaces
sequestration, the FY2014 funding level will
be approximately $1.86 billion
• This means FTA is $240 million short of its
commitments
Packet Pg. 12

1.C.1.a

Attachment: RTD PPT Accessible 12-13 Patton Boggs (1779 : Government Relations Update)

FFGA Funding for the EAGLE P3
• FTA is proposing to use $151 million from
various pools of unobligated and recovered
funding to help close this gap
– At least part of this requires Congressional action

• Even with these funds, there would still be a
gap of almost $100 million

Packet Pg. 13

1.C.1.a

Attachment: RTD PPT Accessible 12-13 Patton Boggs (1779 : Government Relations Update)

FFGA Funding for the EAGLE P3
• The House and Senate are currently negotiating on the
budget through a conference committee
• These negotiations were set up in the legislation that
ended the government shutdown/debt ceiling standoff
• There will not be a “grand bargain.” The hope is for a
small deal that offsets sequestration for at least FY2014
• Key Deadlines:
– December 13th: Deadline for the conference committee
to reach an agreement
– January 15th: Deadline to enact spending legislation for
the rest of FY2014 before government funding expires
Packet Pg. 14

FFGA Funding for the EAGLE P3
• Our Agenda:

– Press for increased funding for New Starts if there is a
budget deal that replaces sequestration
– Work with our delegation to support FTA’s request to
utilize unobligated funds
– Fight for RTD to receive full funding (including prior
shortfalls) before new projects are funded
• Especially new Core Capacity Improvement projects for
which FTA reserves $120 million
• There will be a natural coalition of similarly situated agencies
with this position

MAP-21 Reauthorization
• The current transportation authorization law (MAP-21) expires
September 30, 2014 and will have to be extended or
reauthorized
• The fundamental question: how do we pay for it?
– As cars have become more fuel efficient, gas tax receipts into
the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) have continued to decline
– At the same time, costs for building transportation projects
have increased
– Approximately $15 billion in new revenue per year is needed
beginning in FY2015 to maintain current spending levels

Highway Trust Fund Shortfall

These charts show the substantial annual shortfall in the Highway Trust Fund
beginning in FY2015 – a total deficit of approximately $15 billion per year.
Packet Pg. 18

1.C.1.a

• The Optimistic Take
– Congressional transportation
leaders, Democratic and Republican,
are committed to putting the HTF
on sound footing and are actively
discussing the need for revenue
– Chairman Boxer (D-CA) and
Chairman Shuster (R-PA) have
proven their desire to work in a bipartisan way
– Infrastructure has been a lone
bright spot where this Congress has
been getting things done

MAP-21 Reauthorization

Chairman Barbara Boxer

Chairman Bill Shuster

Packet Pg. 19

MAP-21 Reauthorization
• The Reality Check
– Solving the revenue question is extremely challenging
– Congress has not increased the gas tax since 1993 – over
20 years ago

Congress increased the gas tax in 1983, 1990, and 1993 – but not since then. It
remains at 18.4 cents per gallon, where it has been for 20 years.

Financing Options
• Raise New Long-Term Revenue
– Move towards Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) tax?
• Not on the table as deep privacy, technological and
implementation concerns remain

– Raise money from new energy exploration?
• Could be part of an eventual deal, but CBO does not score it
as raising much revenue

– Increase /index the gas tax, switch to sales tax on
gasoline, or raise non-transportation revenue?
• Very hard to see in the short-term. Greater potential as part
of larger budget deal, but no such deal is in sight
• However, if anything is going to happen, lame duck session
in late 2014 is a potential time for a deal

Attachment: RTD PPT Accessible 12-13 Patton Boggs (1779 : Government Relations Update)

1.C.1.a

Financing Options
• Cut The Program
– Extremely deep cuts would be required
– Proponents of devolution remain
– While cuts are always on the table, Congress has
repeatedly shown it is not willing to cut the surface
transportation program
• Another Short-term Patch
– Since 2008, Congress has kept the program at current
levels through short-term patches and $54 billion in
General Fund transfers into the HTF
– Remains the likeliest scenario at this point
– However, any transfers will almost certainly have to be
offset, making even a short-term patch a challenging issue

1.C.1.a

MAP-21 Reauthorization
• Hearings will ramp up quickly in 2014 as we move into
the reauthorization cycle
– Primary focus will be on financing, especially given recent
policy overhaul in MAP-21
– Will also focus on how MAP-21 changes are being
implemented

• Other key reauthorization issues for RTD:

– Ensure RTD continues to get its fair share of federal transit
funding
– Maintain flexibility in the definition of BRT projects eligible
for New Starts funding
– Consider addressing emergent New Starts policy issues
such as FTA’s use of the horizon year for project benefits

Keeping Federal Stakeholders
Informed and On-Board
• One of our key focus areas is making sure that
RTD’s stakeholders in Washington, DC are
informed and up to date.
– We believe it is critical that Congressional offices
receive regular briefings on the Northwest Area
Mobility Study, North Metro proposal, US 36 BRT
progress, Southeast Corridor Extension, etc.

Memo
To:

RTD Board of Directors

Date:

December 3, 2013

Re:

Update

The following is a brief update on the interim work we have accomplished on behalf of the
District.
Interim Committees
Transportation Legislative Review Committee (TLRC)
The Legislative Council Committee reviewed and approved the five bills submitted by the TLRC
for the 2014 legislative session. Bill 1 Disabled Parking License Plates Placards is an overhaul
of the disability parking laws. Bill 2 Divisible Load Overweight Vehicle Permits authorizes that
an overweight permit for vehicles that haul sludge for wastewater purposes or other loads that
the Colorado Department of Transportation deems a public hazard. Bill 3 Plug-in Electric Motor
Vehicle Definition contains clarification of the definition of a plug-in electric motor vehicle. Bill
4 Highway Restriction Violation Penalties raises the fine for the operator of a commercial
vehicle who violates a road closure or road restriction when the violation of a restriction results
in the closure of a travel lane. Bill 5 Nonconsensual Tow Motor Vehicle concerns the weight of
motor vehicles that are subject to rate regulation when being towed without the owner’s consent.
Flood Disaster Relief Committee
To coordinate and spearhead flood response activities, the Governor appointed Jerre Stead, Chief
Recovery Officer. His office created the Colorado United Website to serve as the central point
of information regarding flood recovery efforts and information resources. In addition, the
Colorado General Assembly established the Flood Disaster Study Committee which has met on
three occasions with their last meeting scheduled for December 20th. To date, over $680 million
has been used for flood recovery efforts.
Transportation
Approximately 485 miles of roadway were damaged or destroyed by the flood. 411 bridges have
been inspected and 120 of those were in need of repairs. The Governor established a goal of
December 1st to have all state highways open and the goal was achieved ahead of schedule at a
cost of $450 million. CDOT credited the Colorado contracting community with their ability to
mobilize quickly. Three major contractors were selected in a competitive process.
The Colorado Congressional Delegation was successful in increasing the cap per disaster from
$100 million to $450 million.

1.C.1.b

2014 Potential Legislation

Statutory Changes
I.
Define and clarify what constitutes an emergency or how an emergency may
be declared under TABOR
II.
Clarify that the state grants of federal monies remain federal funds for
purposes of local fiscal year spending and that such grants are not state grants
for purposes of the enterprise test
III.
Define state grants given to a local government for aid or mitigation of
damages as a consequence of a disaster as gifts or damage awards that are
excluded from the definition of local fiscal year spending
IV.
Clarify that emergency reserves need not be immediately restored and specify
the number of years permitted for restoration
V.
In a state-declared emergency, allow counties to transfer general fund dollars
to the county road and bridge fund, subject to “no substitution” language
stipulating that the county road and bridge mill levy, of which cities receive
50%, is not reduced in such times.
Constitutional Changes
I.
In the event of an emergency, allow a government to have a TABOR election
on any date for purposes of obtaining additional resources to address any need
caused by the emergency
II.
Exclude emergency state aid from local fiscal year spending
III.
Exclude state grants for emergency response and recovery from the enterprise
compliance test
IV.
Eliminate the exclusion of property taxes from permitted emergency taxes.
Legislative Tours
During October and November BBMK held three tours of Denver Union Station to update
legislators on RTD’s progress. Senate Transportation Chair Nancy Todd, House Transportation
Chair Max Tyler, Former Senate Transportation Chair Evie Hudak, Rep. Frank McNulty,
Senator Schwartz’s legislative aide and three Legislative Council Staff of the TLRC Committee
attended the tours.
Meetings with Leadership
BBMK in preparation for the 2014 legislative session has met with Senate President Morgan
Carroll, Speaker Mark Ferrandino, Majority Leader Hullinghorst, Vice Chair of Transportation
Rep. Dominick Moreno, Rep. Elect KC Becker, Rep. Mike Foote, Senator Health’s Legislative
Aide, Westminster Mayor Herb Hutchinson and Jim Gunning. We have been actively
participating in discussions with the Metro Mayors on Impact 64 and any potential legislation on
construction defects.
Packet Pg. 32

Attachment: Brandeberry McKenna Memo (1779 : Government Relations Update)

A number of TABOR reform suggestions have been made by the Colorado Municipal League
(CML); the Colorado Association of School Boards (CASB); Colorado Counties Inc. (CCI); and
the Colorado Special District Association (SDA) to reduce the ambiguities and restrictions that
have hindered the efforts of local governments to implement flood relief efforts. These statutory
and constitutional changes are:

1.C.1.b

Update on Recall

Attachment: Brandeberry McKenna Memo (1779 : Government Relations Update)

Senator Evie Hudak announced her resignation on November 27th, therefore cannot be subject of
a recall. This allows Democrats to appoint a new member to that seat and not face a recall or
potentially losing Democratic control of the Senate. There are several names being touted as
possible appointees to the vacancy including former Representative Sara Gagliardi and Arvada
City Council Member Rachel Zenzinger.
