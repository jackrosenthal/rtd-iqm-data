It is recommended by the Finance, Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD
Board of Directors approve the proposed schedule of internal audits to be performed in
2011.
Approval of Increase to Ciber, Inc, IT Contingency Work Order Contract
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager to execute all documents necessary to increase
the contract value not-to-exceed limit for an existing contract with Ciber for IT Technical
and Management Support Services (Contract 15DK008). This contract was originally
awarded in 2006 to Ciber through the competitive bid process. The contract allowed for
an initial-year plus four (4) one-year options to be renewed based on positive performance
by the vendor. The final option has been executed and the period of performance
extended to April 24, 2011. The proposed action increases the current contract not-toexceed limit of $3,050,000.00 by $300,000.00 to a new total contract not-to-exceed
limit of $3,350,000.00 as well as to extend the contract period of performance to August
31, 2011.
Approval of Increase to Dataman USA, IT Contingency Work Order Contract
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager to execute all documents necessary to increase
the contract value not-to-exceed limit for an existing contract with Dataman USA for IT
Technical and Management Support Services $300,000 to extend the current work order
contract IT Technical and Management Support for General Software Development LifeCycle Services and Migration of Legacy Software (17DK001). This contract was originally
awarded May 1st, 2007 to Dataman USA, LLC (a DBE/SBE company) through the
competitive bid process. The contract allowed for an initial year plus four one year options
to renew based on positive performance by the vendor. In order to continue the fourth
and final option year additional funding must be added to the contract not to exceed. The
proposed action increases the current contract not-to-exceed limit of $915,000 by
$300,000 to a new total contract not-to-exceed limit of $1,215,000.

II.

November 2010 Financial Status Report
Jannette Scarpino provided a quick review of this item. Director Brohl expressed concern
over why the planned grant revenue for 2010 of $319,830 was drastically different than
the actual of $169,099. CFO Howerter explained we had hoped to see more construction
that could have been used to draw down the grants. We are expecting to use all the
funds and will draw down as the construction occurs. This should not be a problem for
future funding opportunities.
Additional questions were asked about the miscellaneous income line as to what this
includes. Terry Howerter will provide more definition.
Director Bagley asked about the estimate on sales tax. CFO Howerter indicated they did
not expect to receive until 1/9/11. They are hopeful that the vendor allowance that is
being considered for extension until June 2011 will include RTD.
General Manager Washington indicated the sales tax information would be included in the
GM report.
