ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. At RTD, safety's our core value. And I'd like to begin
this meeting with the short safety briefing.
If we have a medical emergency that necessitates calling 911, I will ask our RTD Legal Counsel
to make that telephone call. Any medically-trained individuals in the room are respectfully
requested to assist. If needed, an automatic emergency defibrillator, an AED, is in the glass case
located just outside of this room on the wall and to the right.
In the event that we must evacuate the building due to an emergency, please calmly exit out the
door you came in. At the back of the room, go up the stairs, and on the first floor around the
security desk, and exit through the front door. Police and security officers will be there to direct
you to a safe meet-up area. Anyone needing special assistance in the event of an evacuation will
be assisted by RTD staff as necessary.
On a related safety note, RTD takes every reasonable precaution to ensure that security of its
passengers, vehicles, and facilities. That said, the agency relies on both staff and general public to

be aware of, and alert to, any suspicious or dangerous activity on buses and trains, and around the
station stops and platforms. As such, we encourage all of our RTD employees and patrons to
download the RTD Transit Watch app, which allows users to report suspicious or dangerous
activity, and communicate directly with RTD Transit security personnel on a real-time basis, in
fact.
And in the event of an emergency situation, you can contact them immediately. The Transit Watch
app is available via Google Play and the Apple App Store. OK, at this time I want to entertain a
motion to proceed into executive session for the purpose of a discussion of personnel matters
pursuant to CRF 24-6-402(4)(f)(l)
LYNN GUISSINGER: So moved.
TROY WHITMORE: Second.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK, I will-- it's been moved by Director Guissinger and seconded
by Director Whitmore. Do I have everybody-- hm? A show of hands? All in favor?
All right, let the record show that we have everybody in favor of this. I'll note for the record, and
for interested members of the public and the media, that immediately upon the conclusion of our
deliberative process tonight, we will come back to order to address additional board business as
noted on the agenda. Those of you who are not entitled to remain in this room during the executive
session are welcome to wait in the area outside of the boardroom. The meeting is now adjourned
to proceed into executive session.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Do we have to remove bags and coats?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes, please take your bags and jackets, and any other personal
items you have with you. Thank you.
[SIDE CONVERSATIONS]
Directors, this special board meeting will now come back to order. We have one recommended
action for this evening-- approval of the interim general manager contract.
KATE WILLIAMS: Move approval.
BOB BROOM: Second.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK, we have a mover and a second. And-[SIDE CONVERSATIONS]
Yes. The recommended action is, the selection committee of the whole for the interim general
manager selection committee presents to the board a motion to approve the employment agreement
for the interim general manager contract, with certain ministerial changes as previously discussed

and noted by Mr. Painter. May I have a motion to approve the recommended action? That would
be-- OK.
[SIDE CONVERSATIONS]
It was Broom, Bob. OK, let the record reflect that the movement is Director Williams, and the
second is Director Broom. Is there any discussion? All right.
[SIDE CONVERSATIONS]
Director Folska.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Thank you, Chair Rivera-Malpiede. As I've stated before, and for the record
tonight, unfortunately I'm unable to support this motion. I do not think that it is in the best interests
of our fiduciary responsibility to the taxpayers of the regional transportation district. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, Director Folska. Anybody else? Seeing none, I'll ask
the movant, Director Williams, and Director Broom to vote. And then everybody else vote. Did it
work?
The approval of the Interim General Manager's contract is approved, 10 to 5. 10 yeses and five
no's. The no's being Director Lewis, Director Walker, Director Menten, Director Folska, and
Director Mihalik.
Congratulations are now in order for our new Interim General Manager, Mr. Paul Ballard. Paul, if
you're listening, we are looking forward to working with you closely in the coming weeks and
months. Are there any other matters to come before this Special Board meeting? Seeing none, we
are now adjourned.
[SIDE CONVERSATIONS]
Do you want to take a five-minute break? OK.
