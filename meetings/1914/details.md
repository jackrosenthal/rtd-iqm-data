#### 1. Resolution No.___, Series of 2014 Related to the Issuance of RTD Certificates of Participation

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Resolution”), authorizing the issuance of Regional Transportation District Certificates of Participation, Series 2014A.

Motion:              Director Bagley made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the May 27, 2014 Board meeting.

Director Anderson seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Brenden Morgan, Manager of Debt and Investments, introduced Dee Wisor with RTD’s Bond Counsel Butler Snow and Mike Newman with RTD’s Financial Advisor First Southwest Company.  He asked Dee Wisor to discuss the Certificates of Participation (COPs) financing that RTD is preparing to issue.

Dee Wisor explained that this is a lease-purchase financing agreement that is subject to annual appropriation by the Board.  He stated this is similar to what the Board has done in prior transactions, principally for the purchase of rolling stock; this is distinguished from what the Board has done in that this will be financing the North Metro Line itself including the acquisition of right-of-way, installation of other parts of line, etc. and not the rolling stock.  Dee Wisor noted that the COPs have been a challenge to put together but he believes RTD is where we need to be to go to market soon.

Dee Wisor noted that the project being financed is the portion of the Line from Denver Union Station to 104th as RTD has other resources to fund the line north of 104th.  He explained that RTD does not want to have too much in the way of District equity invested into the project for legal reasons under Colorado Law.

Dee Wisor informed the Board that this resolution would authorize the General Manager, or the Chief Financial Officer, to make final pricing determinations when the issue is put into the market.  He pointed out that section three of the resolution establishes parameters limiting the scope of that delegation to a maximum principal amount of $515 and maximum annual repayment cost of $44 million.

Brenden Morgan added that the parameters in the resolution also set a maximum effective interest rate of 6.5%.  He stated that the maximum interest rate is much higher than the rates that staff is currently seeing in the market.  Brenden Morgan said that staff would expect to see rates below 5% if RTD issued today.  He explained that the higher rate of 6.5% gives staff room to navigate should the interest rate market change by the time RTD locks in the rates.

Brenden Morgan commented that another area of interest is the credit ratings.  He shared that staff has had conversations with the three rating agencies: Standard and Poor’s, Moody’s, and Fitch.  Brenden Morgan said that RTD has received a rating from Fitch, affirming their A rating with a negative outlook.  He stated that staff expects to hear from the other two within the next week.

Director Folska inquired if there was a difference in the credit rating for COPs versus a bond.  She wondered what RTD’s credit rating is for bonds at this time as well as what the rating was for the TREX project.  Brenden Morgan stated that there is a difference in the ratings; RTD has two different liens of bonds, the Base System and FasTracks bonds.  He said the ratings for the Base System, or TREX project bonds, are AAA for Standard and Poor’s, Aa2 for Moody’s, and AA+ for Fitch.

Committee Chair Walker requested that Director Folska take the remainder of her bond questions offline as the issue at hand is the North Metro COPs.

Director Solano expressed confusion about the other funds available to build the Line between 104th and 124th such as previously issued FasTracks Sales Tax Revenue Bond proceeds.  He asked for further information about this funding.  Marla Lien, General Counsel, stated that in 2006 RTD issued our first series of FasTracks bonds.   In 2009 RTD bought the right-of-way from Union Pacific Rail Road for $117 million, using proceeds from the 2006 bonds, that is now part of the North Metro project.  She explained that those previous issued bonds bought some of the land that we will now build the North Metro Line on.

Director Bagley shared with the Board that he and Brenden Morgan has been discussing this item earlier.  He pointed out that the Fitch rating being negative is not dissimilar from some of RTD’s ratings on other COPs.  He also noted that out of the three rating agencies, Fitch is the most conservative.  Director Bagley said that one of the things they discussed specifically was the issue of risk; since COPs get paid off on a yearly basis RTD must always have the necessary revenues to pay it off.  He reiterated that while there is this risk it is not dissimilar to the risk, previously assessed to our COPs.  Brenden Morgan stated that is correct.  He explained that Fitch does see a risk that RTD will continue to issue more debt as we build out FasTracks.  Brenden Morgan said that in reference to the annual nature of COPs, they are structured just like a lease.  The RTD Board has the option to appropriate the annual payment on that lease or not appropriate and walk away from that asset.

Director Bagley stated that this negative outlook tells him that our TABOR capacity and the ability to build other corridors or major FasTracks pieces will be limited at this time without other financing methods.  Brenden Morgan stated that if RTD continues to issue COPs to build projects our credit ratings will continue to lower which will lead to higher interest rates.  He noted that as Dee Wisor mentioned, RTD also uses COPs to purchase our buses so this could lead to higher costs for the District.

Director Lubow noted that this COP is for $515 million while the contract the Board approved with Regional Rail Partners (RRP) was for a different amount.  She wondered what the $515 million covers.  Marla Lien explained that the contract that was approved with RRP only funds what RTD is paying for the Design-Build contract.  She stated that RTD has many other costs such as additional right-of-way, purchase of property for stations, RTD staff, system tie-in work to DTP, etc.  She reiterated that what RTD pays to the Design-Build contractor is just a portion of what it costs RTD to build that portion of a line.

Director Lubow asked if $515 million was the maximum amount staff expects RTD would pay to build the North Metro Line to 104th.  Marla Lien stated that $515 million was not the expected maximum cost.  She explained that the Board is authorizing the issuance of these COPs to use proceeds that will all be spent on the project to 104th; RTD has spent some additional funds and will spend additional funds from 104th to 124th.

Director Lubow wondered if COPs are an expensive way for RTD to get funding because of the negative credit ratings.  Brenden Morgan stated that our lowest rating is from Fitch, which is an A rating.  He explained that in the broad pictures this is really in the middle of the investing grade categories.  He said that is the lowest lien that RTD has issued to date so from that perspective it is the more expensive option; however, it is not subject to the constraints of TABOR.  He stated that this is a very valuable tool to RTD.

Chair Sisk said that he was having difficulty reconciling what the Board approved previously, Approval of Contract Award for Design and Construction of the North Metro Rail Line Project, with what was being presented tonight.  He stated this is a deviation from that approval, which needs to be made clear.  Chair Sisk noted that based on this recommendation from staff there is a need for other augmented financing sources; he stated that the Board was not anticipating that need when the original recommendation passed.  He noted that there was an internal decision made by staff not to seek COP funding all the way to 124th. He asked for an explanation of that decision by staff.  Marla Lien stated that Chair Sisk was correct.  She shared that there were a variety of considerations as to why there was a limitation on the use of COPs to 104th.  She said staff and our advisors considered:

- whether or not to include cars

- that there is already tax-exempt bond financing on the Union Pacific right-of-way

- there is a contract with Denver Transit Partners that must be managed around in terms of private use

Marla Lien explained that based on these considerations the decision was made to cut off the use of COPs at 104th and excluded the purchase of rolling stock to limit exposure to certain tax considerations or fleet management issues that would have been problematic.

Chair Sisk asked if there would be additional financing needed to build to 104th for the reasons set forth.  Marla Lien stated that any money needed outside the COPs has already been spent from previously allocated debt; staff is not planning on coming back to the Board for additional funding for the segment to 104th.

Director Hoy asked why the RTD Board and staff had not elected to finance more of FasTracks through COPs since they do not affect our TABOR capacity.  Marla Lien explained that interest rates and TABOR capacity are not the only considerations when determining if RTD should use COPs; there are many considerations that are difficult issues to evaluate.

Director Folska informed the Board that when she was asking about bonds earlier, her questions really had to do with freeing up TABOR capacity so we could continue building the Line.  She asked staff to confirm that we would not be doing any additional financing, whether bonds or COPs to build the Line to 124th.  Marla Lien stated that was correct.

Committee Chair Walker declared the motion PASSED.

##### a. RTD Resolution - 2014A COPs

#### 2. Acceptance of 2013 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors accept and enter into the record the District’s audited financial reports relating to the year ended December 31, 2013 as prepared by Staff and  audited by the District's independent auditor, RubinBrown, LLP.

Motion:              Director Anderson made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the May 27, 2014 Board meeting.

Director Solano seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Doug MacLeod, Manager of Financial Reporting, explained that RTD is required by State statute, federal agencies, and our lenders to complete an annual audit of our financial statements as well as an A-133 audit in addition to the CAFR that is being presented.  He introduced Cheryl Wallace and Matt Marino from RubinBrown, RTD’s independent auditor.  They presented the ViewPoints summary that is available for review in the RTD Board Office.

Director Tobiassen noted that the report discussed RTD’s need for testing of data recovery procedures.  He stated that data recovery and testing on live systems is very risky.  He asked if RubinBrown recommended a detailed testing procedure or if we should get an independent, third-party for testing.  Matt Marino stated that this was something RTD’s IT department was aware of and working on.  He stated that RubinBrown leaves the decision of how to address a recommendation up to RTD’s management.  Cheryl Wallace commented that RubinBrown does have a niche department that works with companies on IT controls.  She shared that one of those team members participated in the RTD audit to add value.

Director Menten expressed concern over RubinBrown’s findings on federal grant compliance.  She wondered if these findings might be that RTD could become ineligible to receive a grant.  She asked for examples of their findings.  Cheryl Wallace said that this is just a follow-up on a prior year’s finding.  She explained that this was related to Davis-Bacon compliance and ensuring the DBE Department was consistent in their required documentation and retention.

Director Folska wondered if accessibility and RTD’s employment of people with disabilities was audited.  Cheryl Wallace stated that was not something that came up in this year’s audit.  Director Folska said she would speak with RubinBrown about this offline as she believes there is a new requirement for organizations receiving federal funding to have a certain percentage of their workforce be people with disabilities.  Staff indicated they would further investigate this requirement.

Cheryl Wallace said that one of the things RubinBrown wants to highlight are any new standards that might affect the District.  She said that the upcoming Governmental Accounting Standards Board’s (GASB) requirements would impact how RTD does its pension accounting.  She explained that currently RTD only has to report a pension liability to the extent it is behind on its annual pension contributions; under the new requirements RTD must report a pension liability for the entire underfunded status of the plans.  Doug MacLeod reminded the Board that this was discussed with the actuaries during a previous meeting.

Director Menten noted that the ViewPoints document stated that it was for Board of Directors and Management use only.  She wondered if she could share this document as she believes it is public record.  Marla Lien explained that certain documents are prepared for the Board for their deliberation that are considered confidential.  She said once the Board adopts the material it will become a public document.

Chair Sisk wondered if staff was running trail balances for our financial statements with the new GASB requirements.  Doug MacLeod said that due to the changes that can happen with the pensions, staff is not currently reporting with the new requirements; however, they do know that if staff had to report with these requirements today there would be an additional $160 million in liabilities.

Director Anderson thanked staff for working with her prior to the meeting so she could get her questions answered.  She feels that the information presented by staff and the auditors was very well done.

Committee Chair Walker declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

#### 1. First Quarter 2014 Investment Report

Brenden Morgan pointed out the benchmarks for the liquidity and enhanced cash tier:

- Liquidity Tier:                                                                                    1st Quarter              Y-T-D

RTD cash and cash equivalents:                                           0.025%              0.025%

B of A/Merrill Lynch 3-month U.S. T-Bill Index              0.012%              0.012%

- Enhanced Cash Tier:                                                         1st Quarter              Y-T-D

RTD cash and cash equivalents:                                           0.078%              0.078%

B of A/Merrill Lynch 3-month U.S. T-Bill Index              0.052%              0.052%

Director Bagley asked if it was standard to use Bank of America and Merrill Lynch for these benchmarks.  Brenden Morgan stated that those are two of many available benchmarks; these are the two prescribed by RTD’s policy.

##### a. ROI MAR 2014

##### b. QUT MAR 2014

##### c. RFM MAR 2014

#### 2. March 2014 Monthly Financial Status Report

Director Bagley noted that for the actual vs. budget ridership numbers we were lower by 1% and for fare revenue we were lower by almost 6%.  He wondered if we were off for fare revenue because of people using different methodologies to pay for fare than staff anticipated (i.e. using a pass instead of a single ticket).  Doug MacLeod explained that the biggest culprit is due to variances in selling passes through King Soopers and Safeway.  He said that staff tries to anticipate what they will sell out of what we have provided but it is a very difficult process.  Doug MacLeod noted that Eco and College Passes can also be difficult as fare revenue has to be spread out over the life of the pass; RTD receives the money up front but it has not been earned.

##### a. 033114 RTD MFS

#### 3. First Quarter 2014 Internal Audit Report

Anne Marie Isaac-Heslop, Manager for Internal Audit, and Kevin Parker, Senior Internal Auditor, referred the Directors to the First Quarter 2014 Internal Audit Report starting on page 62 of the Operations & Customer Service/Financial Administration & Audit Committee Meetings Packet for May 20, 2014.  There were no questions from the Directors on the update.

##### a. Attachments

##### b. Internal Audit Follow up Report

### D. Other Matters

Director Hoy asked for a quick update on our procedures with the Colorado Department of Revenue for assisting them with their auditing activities.  Doug MacLeod stated that RTD has currently engaged Revenue Recovery Group to conduct our audits.  He said they sent letters to six companies requesting documentation on March 31st with an additional 14 going out in May.  He informed the Board that they would be coming back with a more thorough update as the process gets further.

### F. Adjourn

Committee Chair Walker adjourned the meeting at 7:46 p.m.
