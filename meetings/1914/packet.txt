Terry L. Howerter, Chief Financial Officer

Board Meeting Date: May 20, 2014

Subject:

Resolution No.___, Series of 2014 Related to
the Issuance of RTD Certificates of
Participation

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Resolution”), authorizing the issuance of Regional
Transportation District Certificates of Participation, Series 2014A.
BACKGROUND:
The Board adopted Resolution No. 1744 (Series of 2013) on November 26, 2013 expressing its
intent to raise capital to finance the North Metro Rail Line to 124th Avenue through the issuance of
Certificates of Participation (COPs).
DISSCUSSION:
This action item discusses the financing of the North Metro Rail Line project and provides a
Resolution authorizing staff to proceed with issuing COPs to fund the portion of the project between
Denver Union Station and 104th Avenue. The portion of the North Metro Rail Line project between
104th and 124th Avenues is being funded with other funds available to the District including
previously issued FasTracks Sales Tax Revenue Bond proceeds, local government in kind
contributions and RTD unrestricted cash.
The Resolution provides for (a) a principal amount of the Base Rentals payable by the District
pursuant to the Lease of up to $515,000,000 (b) maximum annual amount of Base Rentals payable
in any Fiscal Year of up to $44,000,000 and (c) a maximum net effective interest rate of 6.5%. The
District intends to reimburse itself for certain prior expenditures related to the project with the
proceeds from these COPs as outlined in the Reimbursement Resolution adopted by the Board in
December 2013.
The resolution authorizes staff to determine if obtaining municipal bond insurance for all or a portion
of the 2014A COPs is in the best interests of the District and if so, to select a bond insurer to issue
a municipal bond insurance policy and execute any related documents or agreements required to
obtain the insurance.
The Chief Financial Officer has taken preliminary actions to arrange for the issuance and sale of the
COPs, including assembling financial information related to the District and drafting a Preliminary
Official Statement, Ground Lease, Lease, Continuing Disclosure Agreement, Certificate Purchase
Agreement, Indenture and the Certificate Resolution. The Board is being requested, through the
Certificate Resolution to authorize the issuance, to establish the parameters and to approve
agreements required in connection with the issuance of the COPs.

1.B.1

Drafts of documents in substantially final form referenced in the Certificate Resolution including the
Preliminary Official Statement, Ground Lease, Lease, Continuing Disclosure Agreement, Certificate
Purchase Agreement and Indenture are available for review in the Board Office.
The Chief Financial Officer has also hosted meetings with Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s and Fitch to
provide an overview of the plan of finance for the North Metro Rail Line. A credit rating has been
requested from each of the three rating agency for these COPs.
RTD is receiving the advice of First Southwest Company, as independent financial advisor, Butler
Snow LLP as Bond Counsel and Hogan Lovells and Bookhardt & O’Toole as Co-Disclosure Counsel in
regard to the COPs. The COPs will be underwritten by a team including J.P. Morgan (55%), Piper
Jaffray (15%), BMO Capital Markets (15%), Loop Capital Markets (10%) and Harvestons Securities
(5%).
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Costs associated with the financing are considered “costs of issuance” and will be funded out of
proceeds. These costs include underwriter, rating agency, financial advisory, attorney and
miscellaneous costs. Total costs of issuance are expected to be approximately $2.7 million.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the execution of documents, including the attached Resolution No.__, Series of
2014, authorizing the issuance of the District’s Certificates of Participation, Series 2014A.
This is the recommended action.
2. Do not authorize the execution of documents, including the attached Resolution No.__, Series
of 2014, authorizing the issuance of the District’s Certificates of Participation, Series 2014A.
This is not the recommended action.

Section 7.
No General Obligation Debt. No provision of this Resolution, the

or constituting a general obligation or other indebtedness or multiple fiscal year financial

current fiscal year. The District shall have no obligation to make any payment with respect to
the 2014A Certificates except in connection with the payment of the Base Rentals (as defined in
the Lease) and certain other payments under the Lease, which payments may be terminated by
the District in accordance with the provisions of the Lease. Neither the Ground Lease, the Lease
nor the 2014A Certificates shall constitute a mandatory charge or requirement of the District in
any ensuing fiscal year beyond the then current fiscal year or constitute or give rise to a general
obligation or other indebtedness or multiple fiscal year financial obligation of the District within
the meaning of any constitutional or statutory debt limitation and shall not constitute a multiple
fiscal year direct or indirect District debt or other financial obligation whatsoever. No provision

credit of the District within the meaning of Sections 1 or 2 of Article XI of the Colorado
Constitution. Neither the Ground Lease, the Lease nor the 2014A Certificates shall directly or
indirectly obligate the District to make any payments beyond those budgeted and appropriated
for the District’s then current fiscal year.
Section 8.
Reasonableness of Rentals. The Board hereby determines and
declares that the Base Rentals due under the Lease, in the maximum amounts authorized
pursuant to Section 3 hereof, constitute the fair rental value of the Leased Property and do not
exceed a reasonable amount so as to place the District under an economic compulsion to renew
the Lease or to exercise its option to purchase the Corporation’s interest in the Leased Property

pursuant to the Lease. The Board hereby determines and declares that the period during which
the District has an option to purchase the Corporation’s interest in the Leased Property (i.e., the
entire maximum term of the Lease) does not exceed the useful life of the Leased Property.
Section 9.
No Recourse against Officers and Agents. Pursuant to Section 1157-209 of the Supplemental Act, if a member of the Board, or any officer or agent of the District
acts in good faith, no civil recourse shall be available against such member, officer, or agent for
payment of the principal, interest or prior redemption premiums on the 2014A Certificates. Such
recourse shall not be available either directly or indirectly through the Board or the District, or
otherwise, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute, rule of law, enforcement of penalty, or
otherwise. By the acceptance of the 2014A Certificates and as a part of the consideration of their
sale or purchase, any person purchasing or selling such certificate specifically waives any such
recourse.
Section 10.
Repealer. All bylaws, orders and resolutions of the District, or
parts thereof, inconsistent with this Resolution or with any of the documents hereby approved are
hereby repealed to the extent only of such inconsistency. This repealer shall not be construed as
reviving any bylaw, order or resolution of the District, or part thereof, heretofore repealed.
Section 12.
Severability. If any section, subsection, paragraph, clause or
provision of this Resolution or the documents hereby authorized and approved (other than
provisions as to the payment of Base Rentals by the District during the Lease Term, provisions
for the quiet enjoyment of the Leased Property by the District during the Lease Term and
provisions for the conveyance of the Leased Property to the District under the conditions
provided in the Lease) shall for any reason be held to be invalid or unenforceable, the invalidity
or unenforceability of such section, subsection, paragraph, clause or provision shall not affect
any of the remaining provisions of this Resolution or such documents, the intent being that the
same are severable.
Section 13.
Effective Date. This Resolution shall be in full force and effect
immediately upon its passage and adoption.

Date:

Subject:

Acceptance of 2013 Comprehensive Annual
Financial Report

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
accept and enter into the record the District’s audited financial reports relating to the year ended
December 31, 2013 as prepared by Staff and audited by the District's independent auditor,
RubinBrown, LLP.
BACKGROUND
State statutes require an annual audit by independent certified public accountants. The District is also
required to provide annual audited financial statements to external entities and other government
organizations to be in full compliance with legal covenants, debt agreements, and other contractual
documents. The accounting firm of RubinBrown, LLP performed the 2013 audit. In addition to the
requirements set forth in state statutes, the audit also was designed to fulfill the requirements of the
federal Single Audit Act of 1984 and related OMB circular A-133.
DISCUSSION
A confidential electronic copy of the 2013 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) has been
included in MinuteTraq. Bound copies will be provided at the meeting on May 20. We have been
advised by the auditor’s that the financial statements in the enclosed CAFR present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of the District as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the results of its
operations and its cash flow for the 2013 and 2012 fiscal years in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept and enter into the record the District’s audited financial reports relating to the year ended
December 31, 2013 as prepared by Staff and audited by the District's independent auditor,
RubinBrown, LLP. This is the recommended action, state statutes and other sources, such as
rating agencies and other legal covenants, require the District to enter annual audited financial
statements into the record.
2. Do not accept and enter into the record the audited financial reports relating to the year ended
December 31, 2013 as prepared by Staff and audited by the District’s independent auditor,
RubinBrown, LLP. This is not the recommended action, since state statutes and other sources,
such as rating agencies and other legal covenants, require the District to enter annual audited
financial statements into the record.

First Quarter 2014 Investment Report

INFORMATION
Please find the District’s investment report for the first quarter of 2014 attached.
The U.S. economy expanded modestly (0.1 percent) during the first quarter of 2014. The unemployment
rate declined modestly over the period to 6.7% but still remains elevated and general inflationary
pressures remain tame.
In order to promote economic recovery, the Federal Reserve chose to continue with its accommodative
monetary policy and leave the federal funds target rate range (0.0% - 0.25%) unchanged during the first
quarter noting that this level will continue to be appropriate “for a considerable time after the asset
purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee's 2
percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored.”
The District’s Investment Policy (the “Policy”) is conservative in nature and seeks to satisfy the three
primary objectives of: safety, liquidity and yield, in that order of importance.
The Policy specifies that:
“Quarterly reports shall outline the District’s total investment return and compare the portfolio’s
performance to a publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics
to the portfolio or sub-portfolio being measured. For the liquidity tier of the portfolio (cash and cash
equivalents), the specified index shall be the 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index as published by Bank of
America Merrill Lynch for the period being measured. For the enhanced cash portion of the portfolio
(securities maturing between 90 days and 5 years and with a target duration of 1 year), the designated
performance benchmark will be the Merrill Lynch 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.”

The total return on the liquidity and enhanced cash tiers of the District’s unrestricted portfolio and
investment benchmarks were as follows:
Liquidity Tier:

would produce annualized earnings of $573,719 million. The current return for the month of March was
0.21%.

IN-KIND IGAs
REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
AUDIT REPORT # 13-12-09

IGAs are a common method used by neighboring jurisdictions to cooperate with one
another. The most common form of IGA involves a formal contract for services. One
government agrees to provide a service to another for some form of return including
cash or service exchange without any payment. In addition governments may also enter
into various types of service exchanges under which participating partners agree to lend
services to one another, generally without any payment being required. This Audit was
selected by the Auditors.
SCOPE
The Audit will include review of a sample of In-Kind IGAs in which RTD takes the lead
as well as IGAs in which RTD is a participant or partner.
OBJECTIVES
The objectives of the audit were to:






Determine whether In-Kind services provided by various IGAs were appropriate.
Determine whether In-Kind services were provided.
Determine whether the In-Kind services were fairly valued.
Ensure that the participants are complying with the terms of the agreements.
Ensure that the agreements are formally signed by all participants.
CONCLUSION

The process for In-Kind IGAs is very complicated. Staff at RTD and FasTracks does an
excellent job of preparation and negotiation to ensure that the benefit is mutual. The
policies and procedures should be updated to include, in full detail, how the final IGA is
determined. The conduct of the meetings should also be documented including a list of
those whose presence is necessary.
Management committed to having the Manual updated this year by December 31.

BACKGROUND SUMMARY

1.C.3.a

REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
2014 MANSFIELD FUEL CONTRACT
AUDIT REPORT # 14-02-01

RTD contracted with Mansfield Oil Company of Gainesville, Inc. to supply three types of
diesel fuel for RTD buses. The contract was signed in December 2012 with prices that
would be in effect for calendar year 2013. The document includes a ‘not to exceed’
amount of $17 million for the twelve month period.
Fuel is delivered by local transport companies to various RTD sites and deposited into
designed storage tanks. Deliveries are generally between 7,000 and 7,500 gallons each
and are ordered by RTD supply clerks who also monitor storage tanks to ensure that
RTD does not run out of fuel.
AUDIT SCOPE

Our review included the process to develop an RFP within RTD, obtain and evaluate
proposals from firms expressing an interest in bidding, and selecting the winning
contractor. We also reviewed the controls over RTD fuel ordering, receiving, and
invoice processing during the second half of 2013.
CONCLUSION

The contract award process was appropriately followed as an RFP was prepared,
newspaper advertisement was provided, and numerous companies were individually
contacted by RTD Procurement. The selection of Mansfield Oil was properly justified.
Our testing of paid invoices indicated that fuel charges were in agreement with contract
pricing and invoices were appropriately approved at RTD before issuing payment.
However, we have suggested that the present process to review, approve, and pay
invoices be analyzed in an effort to improve efficiency and timeliness of payment.
CURRENT STATUS

Mutually agreed upon corrective action is underway and will be subject to our normal
Audit follow-up review.




