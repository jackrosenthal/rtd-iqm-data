B. Recommended Actions
Committee Chair Walker stated that there were no recommended actions.

C. Updates

• Local Update - CRL Associates
Roger Sherman, CRL Associates, stated that there were three items on his
report: the Metro Mayors Caucus Transportation Advisory Committee, local
elections, and the Denver GO Bond.
He said that the Metro Mayors Caucus (MMC) remain committed to a 2018
statewide initiative for transportation funding. He said that everyone is
trying to figure out if there is a path forward in the legislature during 2018,
but no decisions have been made yet. He added that the Regional
Transportation Association (RTA) option mentioned in the report is a very
complicated process that would require a signed intergovernmental
agreement (IGA) with every jurisdiction in RTD’s boundaries. He noted
however, that if there was a larger regional RTA, it would include both local
and regional projects. He remarked that if the voters were to approve an
RTA for the front range, it would be difficult to get them to support a state
wide funding option.

Packet Pg. 4

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Aug 1, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Committee Chair Walker asked Barbara McManus to call roll. There were 12 Directors
present at roll call. Director Folska participated via phone, and Directors Deadwyler and
Sisk were absent.

6.A

Mr. Sherman said that, in regards to local elections, the deadline for filing
nominating petitions is August 28, 2017. He stated that some jurisdictions
have candidates announced, while others have no filings to date. He added
that once the ballots are certified, CRL would provide RTD with a complete
list of the candidates within RTD’s service area.

Director Lubow asked if there had been any discussion about approaching
the legislature to make the RTD process less complicated.
Mr. Sherman said that the discussion was about amending or creating a
parallel process that only the metro area would qualify for. He noted that
there was no incentive for rural legislatures to support that, and the
assessment had been that it was a heavy lift because of rural vs. urban
interests.
Director Francone stated that there was a robust discussion earlier in the day
at a Jefferson County (Jeffco) staff briefing. She said that Commissioner
Tighe indicated several times that an RTA would solve all of Jeffco’s
transportation problems. She noted that it is never clear to her when
laymen discuss transportation or what that means, and she said that the
funds they hope to receive would be devoted to fixing potholes and gutters.
Mr. Sherman said that RTA’s fit better when in a single county and noted
the success of El Paso County. He said that the challenge occurs when
there are multiple counties and jurisdictions, and it is even more complicated
with a wider footprint.
Director Anderson said that she was the co-chair of the Statewide
Transportation Advisory Committee (STAC) when El Paso County passed
their RTA and they took a lot of heat from Pueblo County. She commented
that all of the roads in Colorado are connected and they do not end at the
county or city lines. She stated that the best solution would be a state-wide
solution, and if that cannot be done it would be devastating to the entire
state.

• State Update - Brandeberry McKenna
Jenifer Brandeberry, Brandeberry-McKenna (BBMK), said that things have
been busy since the end of June when the Colorado Department of Revenue
contacted RTD about the drafting error in SB 267 which impacted RTD and
other districts’ ability to collect on the 2.9% sales tax on retail marijuana.
Packet Pg. 5

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Aug 1, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Mr. Sherman remarked that, Mayor Hancock submitted his project
recommendations to the Denver City Council on July 12, 2017, and the final
list included additional projects and was larger than the committee had
expected. He noted that the committee will deliberate and refer a final list
to the November ballot.

6.A

She noted that the good news is that the parties involved in drafting the bill
have publicly stated that the drafting error was not their intent, and they
have committed to correcting the issue.

Ms. Brandeberry noted that three topics dominated the last legislative
session: transportation, construction defects reform, and the hospital
provider fee.
Director Lubow asked if there was a list of projects for SB 267.
Ms. Brandeberry said no but said that the Colorado Department of
Transportation (CDOT) had released a white paper explaining the
transportation funds that were identified and how the funding for
transportation would flow.
Director Lubow asked how RTD fit into that discussion.
Ms. Brandeberry explained that the bill allows for $1.8 billion to be bonded
and there is a 10% requirement that CDOT spend those proceeds for transit
projects, with a way for the funds to flow through CDOT.

• Federal Update - Squire Patton Boggs
Mike Dino, Squire Patton Boggs, stated that the federal government is trying
to get some of the spending bills through the process. He noted that the
House Appropriations Committee has marked up and favorably reported out
its fiscal year 2018 Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development
appropriations bill on July 17, 2017. He noted that the House bill makes
some reductions to transportation funding levels compared to fiscal year
2017, and all amendments to increase funding for programs including the
Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) and New
Starts grants were defeated. He noted that in the Senate they had hoped to
have the health care issue taken care of first, but the dominoes were not
falling in the way they had anticipated. He stated that, when they return
from recess, it will be apparent if they have the energy to get things on the
line. He added that the President created a 15-member Infrastructure
Council on July 19, 2017, and the members will represent various interests,
but there have not been any appointments made to date. He further added
that the President is trying to pass tax reform by the end of the year, but
that would be extremely challenging.

Packet Pg. 6

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Aug 1, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Ms. Brandeberry added that the Transportation Legislative Review
Committee (TLRC) has meetings scheduled for September 20, 2017, and
November 2, 2017. She said that BBMK would keep the Board apprised of
dates and times so that they, along with RTD staff, could attend.

6.A

Director Francone asked if the four unfunded corridors would be funded
since they were identified as New Starts.

Director Francone inquired about RTD’s $29 million credit and the status of
those funds.
Mr. Dino said that most likely, it will take a policy change by the Office of
Budget Management as well as some legislation. He said that the issue lies
in that no one has ever paid off their loans or was able to request to get
their money back. He added that he would continue to work towards
finding a solution.
Director Anderson said that Arvada is tired of waiting for the G Line. She
said that her community has been very patient, but they are beginning to get
angry. She said that the University of Colorado A Line runs every day, and
the G Line has the same tracks, crossings, and crossing guards, but no train.
She said that it is time that Arvada went to Washington to voice and
publicize their resentment and they will take the steps to make it happen.

D. Other Matters
Director Francone extended an invitation to the Board to join her for a bike tour of
the light rail system with Bike Jeffco on August 9, 2017. She said that the tour
would begin at the Jefferson County Courts Building at 9:15 a.m. where the tour
will board the W Line. She noted that anyone that wanted to join was welcome,
and to please let her know.
Director Anderson commented that there was not enough room on light rail vehicles
for electric bikes. She added that Bike Jeffco should contact RTD to bar any issues
for the August 9th event.
Committee Chair Walker noted that last week, he attended the APTA Transit Board
Members and Board Support Seminar in Chicago, then participated in the APTA
Leadership Committee in Vancouver, British Columbia. He said that safety is a big
concern and was on everyone’s mind. He also noted that building a culture of
safety starts at the top, and in Vancouver, they were preparing for their
presentations at the APTA Annual Conference in October. He also congratulated
General Manager Genova on his nomination to the APTA Executive Committee.
Packet Pg. 7

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Aug 1, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Mr. Dino explained that the House scaled back on New and Small Starts and
this may be one of the last years that they try to fund what exists. He
noted that the Senate was different in how they approached things, and
they have consistently funded their New Starts program. He commented
that if the government continues to work under a continuing resolution, the
funding levels would revert back to 2017, and there would be money for
those programs, but the eligibility requirements would not change.

6.A

Director Anderson stated that the property in question has always been in public
use. She said that years ago, it was a baseball field, then it became the Boyds
Crossing Park-n-Ride which then became the Olde Town Arvada Park-n-Ride. She
remarked that a piece of that property was transferred back to the city and there
was a lot of remediation for that property. She added that Mr. Dave Chandler who
often discusses the $30.00 land exchange had an opportunity to submit a proposal,
but instead he likes to take issues and boil them down to thirty second soundbites.
She further added that there was plenty of information available about the topic
and recommended that if Director Menten was very interested in the subject, she
should try to get involved with Arvada politics.

B. Recommended Actions

• Recommendation for Contract Award to HNTB for FasTracks Systems
Engineering Consultant Services
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee
that the RTD Board of Directors authorize award of a five-year contract with
an option for a one-year extension with HNTB Corporation in the not-toexceed amount of $22,368,708 for Systems Engineering consulting work.
Motion:

Director Tisdale made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the Month August 15,
2017 Board Meeting.
Director Anderson seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Henry Stopplecamp, Assistant General Manager of Capital
Programs and Facilities, reminded the Board that RTD has used
FRSC as technical consultants for the last twelve years, and
seeing as FasTracks is going to last for an additional few
years, staff went out and put out a new Request for Proposal
(RFP) for a scope of projects currently underway. He stated
that the funds for this item are for a work order contract for
specific tasks as needed. He noted that staff received one bid
from HNTB, and added that a lot of their subs work for RTD
under different contracts. He remarked that their proposal and
processes were reasonable, and staff is requesting to use
HNTB and their subs for five years, with a one year add on to
support RTD and the Base system. He stated that all of the
funding is tied to other projects and this is just a mechanism

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Aug 1, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Folska participated via phone, and Directors Deadwyler and Sisk were absent.

6.B

to have the extension of staff as there is a need for the North
Metro Line and the South East Extension (SERE).

Mr. Stopplecamp explained that this action item was for
HNTB. He noted that the item for FRSC was for a one-year
add-on, which included a continuation of key staff. He added
that the continuation did not award FRSC more work, but
provided the ability to continue legacy projects.
Director Tisdale said that it would be helpful if the record
clearly articulated who RTD had, how long the agency had
them, and why RTD is not going to have them anymore. He
said that most cities have a process that every three to five
years they will re-bid positions to keep everyone focused on
their job, and some of that explanation could be added to the
board report for further consideration. He added that, since
there was only one bid, that was a bit worrisome, and asked if
there was a particular reason as to why RTD only received one
response.
Mr. Stopplecamp stated that the list of subs includes the same
entities that RTD has already been using. He said that there
are not a lot of guarantees moving forward, and with the
market and RTD’s current financial constraints, he did not
know what additional problems RTD might have. He remarked
that staff’s evaluation was harder on HNTB since they were
the only bid to ensure it was the right decision.
Mr. Stopplecamp asked if the Board would need more
information added to the Board Report or if everyone was
satisfied with this explanation.
Director Tisdale commented that he was satisfied, and Mr.
Stopplecamp gave him the exact information he was looking
for.
Committee Chair Lubow inquired about the not-to-exceed
amount referenced in the Board Report and how that worked
in relation to the budget.

Packet Pg. 11

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Aug 1, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Menten said that it was concerning that there was
only one response to the RFP. She then asked why this was
in front of the Board as the Board approved a contract
extension with FRSC and Triunity Hill a few months ago.

6.B

Mr. Stopplecamp remarked that this is a work order contract.
He explained that, if a project is approved, this would provide
the funding source. He noted that staff would still identify the
scope of work, set a project budget, and then create a work
order. He added that this would only be applied to Board
approved projects throughout the district.

C. Updates

• 2015 Quality of Life Report
Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager of Planning, stated that Lacy Bell,
Corridor Planning Manager, and Paul DesRocher, Planning Coordination
Manager, would be presenting the Quality of Life Report to the Board.
Ms. Bell said that the Quality of Life (QoL) study was set up to track how
the FasTracks program was meeting the three core goals outlined in the
2004 Board Adopted FasTracks plan. She stated that the intent was a
quantitative approach to see how the program was meeting those defined
goals. She stated that the three core goals were: balance transit needs with
regional growth, increase transit mode share, and improve transportation
choices and options. She commented that, at the time FasTracks was
passed, the Board and General Manager thought it would be beneficial to
track the progress of the program, and its achievement of the outlined goals.
She noted that staff tracked 60 to 70 available data measures to track
progress and commented that some of the measures are regional, at the
corridor level, and some are stationary. She added that the way staff had
set up the report is that a full measure report will be done every three to five
years and a high level, 12-metric report, will be created annually. She stated
that this report is the first time staff has provided a full report since a
FasTracks project has been opened, and this report is for 2015. In addition,
staff has also produced a video to demonstrate to RTD’s stakeholders what
staff has learned.

Packet Pg. 12

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Aug 1, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Folska stated that she would be voting in favor of this
item.

Mr. DesRocher stated that he would discuss the infographic and noted that
it had a similar format to the Downtown Denver Partnership’s (DDP) annual
commuter survey. He said that the first page was a 2015 retrospective
progress map and explained that it takes staff a year to collect the data and
another year to analyze it. He commented that the study examined 70
different measures that fit into the three primary goals, and in 2015 there
were three projects that were online, the W Line, Denver Union Station, and
the Free Metro Ride. He stated that over a five-year period from 20102015, staff observed 7,600 new passengers per day into the W Line
corridor. He added that Denver Union Station had significant development
around the area which included 2,700 multi-family units, 130 new hotel
rooms, and hundreds of thousands of new square footage in development.
Also, the Free Metro Ride was opened in conjunction with Denver Union
Station and staff saw great boarding numbers with that service as well.
Mr. DesRocher said that in reviewing the first goal in 2015, there was:
 10% population growth
 17% job growth
 230% increase in housing starts
 24% increase in areas served by high frequency transit
 22% more rapid transit infrastructure
 6% increase in Access-a-Ride service
 3% increase in transit service
He said that for goal two, the numbers were as follows:
 12% increase in daily vehicle miles driven in the region
 84 more miles driven per person each year
 2% increase in vehicle ownership
 13 days that exceeded the air quality standard
 15% increase in vehicle emissions
 3x more likely to die travelling in a car than on a bus
 27% more expensive for regional commuters to drive vs using public
transit
He noted that goal three had the following data points:
 Auto commute travel times got longer and less predictable
 8 minutes per day average additional time people sat in their cars
 14% increase in time spent in congestion each day
 24% of roadways experienced congestion for longer than 3 hours
each weekday
He commented that staff is continuing to make this data more accessible but
said that there is still quite a bit of lag between getting this data out to the
public. He noted that staff wants to put this information online so that it is
electronically accessible, and also staff wants to adjust the data points so

6.B

that the report is more flexible and can be reported on much faster. He said
that staff will be pursuing those changes for the 2016 report.

Director Menten said that the 7,600 transit riders each weekday seemed
really high and almost impossible.
Ms. Bell said that staff reviewed bus ridership in the corridor before the W
Line opened and then examined ridership on the bus routes in conjunction
with the 12,000 riders each day on the W Line, and that equated to 7,600.
Director Menten commented that the routes that were coming out of the
Federal Center were eliminated and shuffled over, and those riders would
not have been new. She added that she would like to see the background
data for those numbers.
Director Francone stated that the infographic was beautiful and the video
was also very interesting. She asked about the information presented in the
info graph and what data sources were used to compile the report.
Ms. Bell explained that staff used several different data sources such as the
census, in-house work, and information from Denver Regional Council of
Governments (DRCOG).
Director Francone added that she did not understand the 5% increase in
annual boardings and the 4% decrease in boardings per capita.
Mr. DesRocher explained that the 5% increase in annual boardings was the
total number of annual boardings from 2010-2015.
Ms. Bell added that the boardings per capita actually decreased because
transit ridership had not kept pace with regional growth.
Director Francone asked how, if people have more access to public transit,
that translated into RTD’s interest in creating ridership.
Mr. DesRocher stated that staff has a detailed report that explains each data
point and that document might help with a lot of questions the Board may
have.

Director Williams said that while this report is really great, it is 2017 and this
is totally passé. She noted that the report should have a disclaimer on the
front to apologize for the two-year delay. She added that unfortunately this
is an era in which everyone can get immediate information and this report
for 2015 is almost embarrassing. She recognized that data collection takes
time, but it should also have a disclaimer.

6.B

Director Walker remarked that this is a quick snapshot of what has
happened, and for those that want to look deeper, there are resources
available. He added that Chicago has a post rider survey and inquired if RTD
did something similar.

Director Walker commented that in a post rider survey, 30% listed safety as
the main reason as to why they stopped riding. He added that when he was
in Vancouver, he felt extremely safe and that city is the same size as
Denver, though Vancouver only had 12 homicides and 15 traffic fatalities in
2016.
Director Walker added that there was a big announcement yesterday that
two large engineering firms would be consolidating. He asked what affect
that would have on RTD’s capital projects.
Mr. Van Meter explained that there was enough competition and capacity
that it would have a minimal impact to RTD. He added that overall, it would
create good competition and capacity to deliver on projects in the region.
Director Tisdale commented that this should actually be labeled as the 2017
report, which provides the latest information available, for 2010-2015. He
said that the since the infographic and video are accessible, the full report
should be, too.
Ms. Bell said that, when the report is finalized, it will be online as well.
Director Broom inquired as to who was the intended recipient for the report.
He asked whether it was for the tax payer or for a transplant into the metro
area.
Mr. Van Meter said that a broad range of audiences have expressed interest
in the report, including a number of stakeholders, chambers of commerce,
transportation professionals, economic development professionals and local
staff. He added that this has been presented nationally at APTA, and a lot
of agencies are interested in how RTD tracked the metrics and which
metrics were used.
Director Broom agreed with Director Tisdale and said that the report should
be renamed to the 2017 report.
Director Folska inquired if staff had considered distributing this to the state
legislature.

Mr. Van Meter stated that RTD had not done one recently.

Mr. Van Meter noted that it was not something he had considered but said
that it would be a good idea.

Mr. Van Meter explained that staff endeavored to present both the good and
the bad. He said that the report is data driven with facts and there are some
continuing challenges. He noted that staff is aware of the ridership plateau
and it shows in the numbers metric.
Director Anderson remarked that this report shows that metro Denver is
growing and people are driving cars more. She added that what this report
does not show is where metro Denver is growing, which is Windsor, Fort
Collins, Firestone, Castle Rock, Douglas County, etc. She said that metro
Denver is growing in all of the wrong places, but the population growth has
kept up with DRCOG’s projections.
Director Williams added that she would like this report more if it said 2017
instead of 2015 and further added that there should be a question on the
back asking how RTD did with an option for people to complete a survey or
provide feedback.

D. Other Matters
Chair Hoy said that in the recent past Committee Chair Lubow had discussed a
resolution that she would like the Board to entertain regarding FasTracks. He said
that he would like to see as staff and the Board go through the Annual Program
Evaluation (APE) process to see if there is a best way to move forward. He
suggested that the Board wait for the APE and after that time he would consider
creating an ad hoc committee to discuss the matter and come up with an
appropriate resolution, or not, depending on the circumstances.
Committee Chair Lubow commented that she and Director Tisdale had an
appointment to review the wording of the resolution to make it more inclusive and
more viable. She added that this was a parallel track and will be continuing.

E. Next Meeting Date - September 5, 2017

Committee Chair Lubow said that in her opinion, RTD is not doing very well.
She said that RTD has spent a lot of money but at best, the agency is just
running in place. She said that there is a problem here and not talking about
it is not the best way to handle things.

B. Recommended Actions

• Approval of Bank Signature Authorization
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors approve the attached Bank Account Signature
Authorization Agreement (the “Agreement”).
Motion:

Director Tisdale made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the August 15, 2017
Board Meeting.
Director Anderson seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Heather McKillop, Chief Financial Officer/Assistant General
Manager of Finance & Administration, said that Brenden
Morgan, Senior Manager of Debts & Investments, would
provide a brief overview of this action item to the Board.
Mr. Morgan stated that this action item was for an update to
RTD’s bank account signature authorizations. He said that the
change this time is in relation to the winding down of the
Denver Union Station Project Authority (DUSPA). He noted
that DUSPA and RTD are creating an agreement so that the
remaining payments will be made through RTD and that $1.5
million will be deposited into a commercial checking account
to pay the remaining obligations. He added that this account
will help staff track the remaining outstanding obligations.
Ms. McKillop noted that there is a predetermined list of
obligations which will require the signature of the CEO on the
Packet Pg. 19

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Aug 8, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Directors Archuleta, Deadwyler, and Folska were absent.

6.C

invoices. She added that this account is only the mechanism
to make the necessary payments.

Mr. Morgan commented that staff had not yet received an
expenditure schedule from DUSPA for the remaining
payments. He said that once the schedule was received, staff
can determine if any of the funds can be invested. He
remarked that the funds would not be in the account long, as
they will most likely be spent within a year, but staff will try
to make prudent investments with the money if possible.
Committee Chair Menten asked if street improvements would
be paid for with these funds.
Ms. McKillop explained that there are a variety of things that
need to be paid out but the bulk of the money will be applied
to a project that RTD will be administering on behalf of DUSPA
and the project will last one to two years. She noted that the
remaining funds will be applied to several other smaller
projects.

C. Updates

• Quarterly Investment Report
Mr. Morgan commented that the District’s investment report for the second
quarter was included in the packet. He stated that page 11 of the packet
had the two line graphs for Cash & Equivalents Performance and Enhanced
Cash Performance. He added that the lower graph is the actual performance
compared to the benchmark, and there was nothing too exciting to report at
this time.

• Strategic Budget Plan (SBP)
Ms. McKillop stated that, staff would provide an update on both the
Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) and the Annual Program Evaluation (APE). She
explained that most of the information to be presented the Board has already
Packet Pg. 20

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Aug 8, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Broom asked if the funds would be invested.

6.C

Jannette Scarpino, Senior Manager of Budget and Financial Analysis,
commented that she would discuss the SBP outside of the PowerPoint. She
noted that staff had prepared two previous drafts and this is the third. She
explained that staff had gathered more information, sharpened their
assumptions, and have continued to analyze the project requests in the SBP.
Ms. Scarpino commented that staff had further reduced project requests to
minimum must have projects for both Expense and Capital. Staff had also
reduced operating expenses by $5 million annually, diesel fuel pricing was
added to the plan with an estimate of $1.80 per gallon, and this combination
represents a higher difference of $17 million over the SBP term. She noted
that the fleet will be acquired with previously issued Certificates of
Participation (COP) proceeds and the use of the Capital Acquisition Fund.
She added that the fleet replacement had been reduced in size by $40
million and the Board Appropriated fund and Operating Reserve will continue
to be funded at $3 million and $5 million annually, respectively. In this third
version, staff has reduced the gap to $160 million, but the SBP is still far
from being balanced. She explained that, in terms of cash flow, RTD had
exhausted all of the usual options and what RTD was facing was not a
pretty picture. She noted that projects identified to proceed in this SBP
version were a small fraction of RTD’s total needs and the list of the
minimum must have projects identified so far may change as the SBP is
balanced. She noted that staff included the deferred projects list, and those
appeared on pages 30-32 of the packet. She remarked that the deferred
projects total $400 million between operating and capital expenses over the
six-year term of the SBP and the deferral list may change as staff still needs
to close the funding gap. She added that many of the deferred projects are
becoming critical and staff will likely need to review the same projects again
for next year’s SBP. She commented that, staff expects the Base system to
fund FasTracks as early as 2023, and although it does not appear in the
cash-flow at the moment, the need may arise.
Ms. McKillop stated that staff will be back again at the Study Session on
August 22, 2017, to walk the Board through the six-year SBP and the long
range financial plan.
Director Broom asked if the projections included salary increases for
upcoming years.
Packet Pg. 21

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Aug 8, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

seen before, but staff wanted to update the Board on a few changes. She
commented that staff hopes to have the APE and the SBP as close to being
balanced as possible by next month, and staff will also introduce the long
range financial plan for the first time in 2017, which will not be balanced.
She added that staff has some systemic problems in the long range plan,
and that will be discussed further at the Study Session on August 22, 2017.

6.C

Ms. Scarpino stated that salary increases were not broken down, but were
included as a whole.

Ms. McKillop stated that there were multiple reasons, but they were all very
similar. She said that from the revenue side there were two issues: sales
and use taxes as well as grant revenues were down. She added that when
revenue goes down and expenditures go up, those compound each year.
Director Lubow inquired if these things were foreseeable or if staff was
surprised.
Ms. McKillop said that she was not surprised. She commented that staff
made adjustments to the model and informed the Board last year that this
year would be difficult.
Director Lubow remarked that this year was not an economically bad year.
Ms. McKillop explained that in previous years, to some degree, RTD lived
beyond its means. She said that this should not be a surprise, but RTD
needs to get to a point where it can maintain what it has and not expand
beyond that threshold.
Ms. Scarpino added that RTD has been struggling on the FasTracks side and
said that the Base system has had to assume some of the FasTracks costs.
Director Williams asked about the bond proceeds used for capital
expenditures on line 31. She inquired if they had been paid off, or if RTD
was out of bond proceeds.
Ms. McKillop said that RTD is out of bond proceeds. She said that the
Transportation Expansion Project (T-REX) bonds will be paid off in 2025,
which creates another problem that is a Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TABOR)
issue. She added that the majority of the bonds will be paid off in 2024.
Director Williams commented that there are 100,000 people a year moving
to the Denver metro area. She asked if those people were not using transit.
Director Sisk said that given the continued sobering effect of the budget,
staff needs to get this information out to the public. He said that they will
not want to be surprised, and there are not enough funds to put into the
FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) reserve. He added that RTD is
Packet Pg. 22

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Aug 8, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Lubow said that this projection seemed more difficult than
projections from previous years. She noted that there were higher expenses
on the N Line but asked staff if they could articulate what exactly was going
on.

6.C

General Manager Genova stated that staff has been presenting information
in a variety of forums. He noted that last week he presented at the full
Metro Mayors Caucus and Ms. McKillop presented at the North Area
Transportation Alliance (NATA) group. He commented that this week he
would present at the North Metro Elected Officials meeting, and staff is
trying to inform all of RTD’s stakeholders about where the agency is
financially.
Director Williams added that this information should be presented to the
Pass Program Working Group.
Director Sisk commented that this information runs concurrently with both
staff and the Board talking about this. He added that the Directors should
not make promises that the agency cannot deliver.
Director Francone stated that the agency is expanding and is not able to
take care of what it has. She said that she hopes staff would address some
of those concerns at the Study Session and, as Directors, they need to
know as much information as possible so that they can tell their constituents
the truth. She noted that the Directors are held accountable and are
responsible for both the Board and the agency. She added that first and
foremost, Directors need up-to-date information about the projects currently
under construction, such as the South East Rail Extension (SERE), the G
Line, and the N Line.
Chair Hoy said that in regards to Director Williams comment about 100,000
people per year, that number is a bit deceiving because 30,000 of those are
babies born here. He added that many years ago, there was a Sustainability
Task Force Committee and a lot of good things came out of that series of
meetings. He noted that one of the hardest things he has gone through was
the service cuts, and RTD will either have to increase revenue or decrease
its expenditures. He commented that he has been informing his constituents
about RTD’s fiscal health and encouraged others to do the same. He then
inquired if staff had locked in fuel for 2018.
Ms. Scarpino said that staff expects the fuel lock to be higher in 2018 than
it was in 2017. She noted that, at present, it is steady at $1.80 per gallon.
Director Anderson said that she agreed with Director Sisk that the issue is
serious and that RTD needs to let people know. She remarked that she is
Packet Pg. 23

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Aug 8, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

building up the expectations of its constituents and RTD needs to tell them
that we are down to $0 and will be making hard cuts. He further added that
he would rather be the agency that said here is what happened versus
having people speculate. He noted that it is not a great thing, but it is
manageable.

6.C

Director Lubow stated that she agrees that it is important to be real, honest,
and transparent about RTD’s fiscal health. However, she commented that
her constituents are going to say that they will not get their project and
there are going to be a lot of angry people in her district and that discussion
will need to be dealt with.
Director Solano commented that a couple of years ago RTD was initiating
projects but now the agency is running out of money and telling people that
the projects will not be completed. He said that he had gotten a call at 4
a.m. that morning from a constituent who said that their bus did not show
up. He said that, in order for this agency to run properly, operators need to
be paid a living wage.
Director Broom explained that RTD is dependent on sales and use tax, but
one major trend underway is that people are spending less on goods and
more on services. He noted that sales taxes are not collected from services,
which RTD should examine, and added that other cities and transit agencies
are all experiencing the same type of problem.
Director Tisdale remarked that the one thing that would really benefit RTD,
along with others, is the passage of the federal Main Street Marketplace
Fairness Act so that RTD could get the sales taxes from all internet sales.
He noted that people are buying goods, if not more so, but they are doing it
online. He commented that RTD does not receive all of the taxes it deserves
and the agency needs to see that this bill is passed and implemented. He
added that there is a hiccup in the state law right now and RTD is losing
revenue for the rest of the year, and hopefully, that will be returned once the
legislature returns to session next year, as there are tax dollars that RTD is
entitled to but not receiving.
Director Francone commented that the solution to RTD’s problem is not to
receive additional tax funds but to examine how the agency is spending the
funding it receives. She asked if RTD was spending money to further
transportation or if it was being spent elsewhere. She remarked that staff
and the Board need to figure out what RTD is spending its money on and
determine if it is for RTD’s mission.
Committee Chair Menten asked if staff could explain the Corporate
Rebranding, Imaging, and Education line item.
Packet Pg. 24

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Aug 8, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

concerned with using Base system funds for FasTracks and added that the G
Line needs to be opened and put into revenue service. She further added
that the G Line should be a priority for the agency and getting that line up
and running could help make a difference in RTD’s finances. She explained
that it is imperative that the agency provide service to everyone, but noted
that tax money can and does run out.

6.C

General Manager Genova explained that it is to improve marketing materials
in a more strategic manner in order to increase ridership. He added that it is
only under consideration at this time.

o Future operating and maintenance costs
Financial Plan
o FISA balance drawn down by 2022 to replenish unrestricted
fund balance
o Capital Acquisition Reserve balance drawn down in 2020
o Funding shortfall remains after reserves are drawn down

Ms. Cohen noted that the summary cash flow side had not changed, but the
only difference was that the negative fund balance was highlighted in red.
She added that staff has examined alternatives to reduce the funding
shortfall by possible revisions to FasTracks corridors, completing an internal
budget review on all FasTracks projects, and using Base funds for FasTracks
to cover the deficit. She noted that an updated cash flow chart would be
available at the Study Session on August 22, 2017.

• June 2017 Monthly Financial Status Report
Doug MacLeod, Controller, remarked that the report is for the June financial
results. He noted that, halfway through the fiscal year, RTD is in the green
and the budget is positive on a year-to-date basis. He noted that, because
of their late release date, the exact sales and use tax figures were not
included in the packet, but they came out better than staff had estimated.
He commented that July’s report will demonstrate the negative figures from
the loss in sales and use taxes, and if things continue, RTD should be on
budget by the end of the year. He explained that fare revenue is over
budget by 2.8% and on a year-to-date basis the agency is up 10%. He
noted that all of the expenses are under budget, but there are still six more
months to go.
Committee Chair Menten inquired about the changes to the marijuana tax
retention and where the difference in taxes are going.
Ms. McKillop stated that as of July 1, 2017, marijuana retailers are no
longer collecting the 2.9% tax, or RTD’s tax. She added that they were

She noted that the issues were:

notified to change their point of sale machines to no longer collect it and
stated that RTD found out when the state began to produce information to
notify the vendors of the change in tax collection.

• SmartCard Project Update

Committee Chair Menten said that changing the report update to quarterly
should not be a problem and, if an update is needed, it could be fit in.
Tonya Anderson, Electronic Fare Operations Manager, stated that the King
Soopers and Safeway expansion had been fully live for a month. She said
that during the testing phase in the first quarter, King Soopers averaged
$700 per store. She noted that Safeway did well in the first and second
quarter and the average load at that store was $36.00. She noted that, in
terms of stabilization, there will always be issues with technology, and staff
has been working through those issues through a ticket system with
Conduent. She stated that Conduent is very responsive and is working
alongside staff to mitigate any issues. She said that, for the MyRide Portal,
staff is working on the Payment Card Industry (PCI) remediation and plans
on a December release date. She added that staff is also working on the
auto re-load ability so that customers can have a scheduled re-load applied
to their cards so that they would not have to visit the web portal each time.
She further added that the platform validator screen tests continue and so
far the weather has been slightly cooler, so staff has not documented as
many issues. She noted that staff is still waiting for Conduent to provide
remediation to determine why certain screens are not working.
Director Broom commented that, for both King Soopers and Safeway, they
participate in this program because it will bring people in the door. He asked
if there was a vendor fee associated with the program.
Ms. McKillop said yes, and indicated that RTD pays them 1.5%.
Director Francone stated that she continues to receive accolades for the
MyRide program but noted that when she hears complaints about the
validators, it is usually when the temperatures are high. She congratulated
Conduent for a job well done and inquired about the Notice to Cure that was
sent to Xerox.

Packet Pg. 26

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Aug 8, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Ms. McKillop commented that this chart is dwindling away because the main
portions are going away. She said that in September there will not be a lot
to discuss, so she asked the Board if the SmartCard Project Update could be
provided quarterly instead of monthly. She added that after the disaster
recovery in September, not much of the report will change except for routine
upgrades and maintenance.

6.C

Ms. McKillop said that they are still under a Notice to Cure as there are still
two outstanding items: PCI compliance and the platform validators. She
added that they still have outstanding obligations under that notice that RTD
is holding them to. She added that the weekly calls are going well and
things have improved dramatically but noted that it does take constant
communication from both sides.

Ms. Anderson remarked that at this time it is based on value. She said,
once the balance of the card falls below a certain dollar amount, it would
automatically reload.
Chair Hoy inquired if the sales at the grocery outlets were new sales or if
they were from the old standard media.
Ms. McKillop said that staff did not have enough information to make that
determination. She stated that staff would observe the trends to determine
if there was a shift from paper products to the MyRide Cards and mobile
ticketing.
Chair Hoy commented that over time it would be advantageous to have
people use smart media products in order to reduce the costs of the paper
media products.
Ms. McKillop stated that staff is considering ways to encourage people to
use the new ticket options.
Director Tisdale explained that the Directors, from time to time, are given
tickets to pass out to people. He said that the Directors are not using
MyRide Cards yet but asked if in time the Board would use them, too.
Ms. McKillop indicated that the cards would have to be registered in order to
track their use. She said that staff is currently discussing options and
determining what Board distributed MyRide cards would entail.
Director Anderson commented that it may not behoove the Board to pass
out stored value cards, especially since there are different values for
different types of service.
Ms. McKillop stated that staff would have to review the logistics. She
explained that, if someone lost their card without registering it, the value
would be gone. She noted that staff is trying to figure out how to
accommodate people within the system, and so far, they have been able to
make several of the requests work.
Packet Pg. 27

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Aug 8, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Walker asked if the auto re-load would be based on a monthly or
weekly schedule.

6.C

Director Williams asked whether there would be motivation for King Soopers
and Safeway to steer people to the MyRide Cards if staff removed some of
the constraints off of the system. She then stated that RTD should look at
partnering with someone else if Conduent is not helping the agency get to
where it wants to be.

Director Walker said that one of the benefits of attending various APTA meetings is
hearing from other agencies that are having the same issues as RTD with regards to
ridership and finances. He said that in general people are spending less on luxury
items and fun stuff, so society is in the same position it was in when the recession
hit. He added that RTD will tighten its belt to meet the current demands in order to
get people where they need to be.
Director Francone noted that she appreciated staff’s and the General Manager’s
ability to walk through and discuss issues with the Board and she encouraged them
to bring everything forward, both good and bad, so that everyone is on the same
page. Lastly, she noted that four Directors had not completed their General
Manager survey and she asked that the remaining surveys be completed as soon as
possible.

B. Recommended Actions
Committee Chair Anderson stated that there were no recommended actions.

C. Updates

• January 2018 Service Change
Bruce Abel, Acting Chief Operations Officer and Assistant General Manager
of Bus Operations, said that the first update item is the 2018 January
service changes. He said the first draft of the service changes are the
proposal to Board in an informal setting. He noted that staff is not asking
for any action but rather to communicate to the Board the draft proposal
that will be taken out to the community for RTD to solicit input, feedback,
etc., to help staff craft a final service change recommendation.
He stated that the January 2018 service changes are about living within
means, about how RTD, as stewards of the taxpayers’ dollars, has an
obligation to make sure that the agency’s services match ridership levels. He
stated that the agency is not about operating vehicles, it is about moving
people. He further added that it is also RTD’s obligation to make sure it is a
financially sustainable organization.
He stated that recommendations in the proposal are revisions to FasTracks
funded services because the organization has integrated financially between
the Base system and FasTracks. He said that he heard the comment earlier
that the Base system will begin cross-subsidizing FasTracks through 2023.
He added that the question is whether it happens in 2021, 2022, or 2023.
It is not a question of whether the Base system will cross-subsidize
FasTracks, but when and to what extent. He said the agency’s view of
whether FasTracks funded services and projects are appropriately sized has
a direct impact, because if the agency lessens the FasTracks service pitfalls,

Directors Archuleta, Deadwyler, and Folska were absent.

6.D

RTD will have less of a cross subsidy from the Base system that has to go
support FasTracks. He added that the smaller the hole is in FasTracks, the
smaller the subsidy is from the Base system to fund that hole in FasTracks.

Jessie Carter, Manager of Service Planning and Scheduling, stated that as
Mr. Abel alluded, this proposal contains a mix of service efficiencies and
observations, which included reduction of service on Route 42 and 45. He
said that Route 42 is a new route that was just introduced in April 2017,
but because of the level of services needing to meet the agency’s ridership
expectations, staff is proposing turning it down. He added that the agency
is proposing to eliminate Route 89 which is something the agency has
revisited before in the past, back in 2012, and is now reviewing it again
because, it only carries 115 boardings per day, which is well below the
standard for a route in its category. He further added that there are a
number of changes to FasTracks routes, which include the R Line, the W
Line, and also late night services.
Mr. Carter noted that the change that is the most striking is the R Line,
given that that it is RTD’s newest line. He said that he can imagine the
questions that may come up as to why the agency is looking at cutting the
services of something so new. He stated that is simply answered by looking
at its ridership performance. He said the current performance on the R Line
sits at about 41 boardings per hour and noted that the F Line sits at about
173 boardings per hour in comparison. He said that the proposed cuts to
the W Line would yield 141 boardings per hour. He added that, when the
agency made the decision on the W Line to reduce its services to increase
its productivity, it was sitting at 72 boardings per hour. He said that looking
at the R Line relative for where the agency started with the W, the R is right
below that.
He stated the proposal on the R Line is to reduce the off-peak service and
weekend service, and it will also not operate south of Florida station. He
said the current service operates every 15 minutes, all day, from Peoria and
Smith station, all the way down to Lincoln station at Lone Tree. He said the
agency is proposing to revise the off-peak mid-day service to only operate
between Peoria and Smith and Florida Station. He added that the agency
hopes to cut the number of hours by 15,000 annually, and this will bring the
line’s productivity up. He said the agency is hoping to double the number of
boardings to 80 per hour, which would be more sustainable.
Packet Pg. 31

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Aug 8, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

He stated that part of the underlying theme of the conversation is that
operating changes generate more positive financial impacts faster than
capital reductions. He said a $4-million savings in each year for six years is
far better than saving $4 million by not doing capital projects in 2018
because that is an ongoing savings that builds upon itself or compounds
over time.

6.D

Mr. Carter stated the W Line proposal is simpler because the agency has
done a lot of the work through pervious service cuts. The projected ridership
on the W line started out at 19,000, boardings, and RTD is seeing about
13,000-15,000 boardings per day. He added that ridership is actually good
at this point but noted the line started out with a 7.5-minute peak
frequency. He further added, that now RTD is down a bit and the ridership
went from 72 boardings per hour up to 141 boardings per hour. He added
that the midday service does not meet the standard for operating every 15
minutes and the agency is considering reducing that frequency to every 30
minutes during the midday and on the weekends. He explained that the
weakest point of ridership is between Federal Center Station and the
Jefferson County Government Station, which is where the agency is
proposing the lesser frequencies.
Mr. Carter stated that, looking at the late night issues, the agency is trying
to create a larger Maintenance of Way (MOW) period. He said that, for
maintenance to be done on the systems, the agency is proposing to cut the
last trips off of the E, F, and D Line services. He added that all of these
actually accommodate a cost savings of $3.9 million on the rail side by itself
and added to the $500,000 savings the agency is looking at on the bus
side, for a $4.4 million savings overall. He said the agency is planning on
providing eight public hearings to go over the proposed service cuts:







Golden to talk about the W Line
Aurora to talk about the R line
Northeast Denver to talk about Routes 42, 45 and 89
Boulder to talk about changes on the JUMP
Two in Denver
Curtis Park to talk about the L line.

Mr. Abel explained that Maintenance of Way (MOW) work occurs every
evening for track inspection. He added that currently, the last train comes in
a little after 1:00 a.m. and the first train goes out at 3:30 a.m., which gives
Packet Pg. 32

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Aug 8, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Mr. Carter stated that staff is trying to maintain the frequency to every 15
minutes. He said it is important because the way the bus service works is
based on a 15-minute increment. He noted that reducing the services down
to every 30 minutes, would sustain a better chance of getting better
ridership on the line. He said on the weekends, service would run from
Peoria down to Florida again, then the R Line would become the H Line. He
added it would interline with the H Line, then continue on. He said this
would protect some of the connections and allow for one train connection to
the corridor on the Southeast, and peak hour would remain as is, which is
every 15 minutes, all the way from Peoria and Smith, down to Lone Tree.

6.D

RTD workers 2.5 hours to go out to do State of Good Repair work. He
further added that providing additional time improves the agency’s ability to
perform track inspections for long-term sustainability of safety.

Mr. Carter remarked that the agency has to pay attention to the impact on
the airport workers. He added that the University of Colorado A Line itself is
not being effected, however, connecting to it from the W Line would be
affected. He said that there might be some other slight adjustments the
agency makes to the schedule.
Director Lubow asked about the JUMP changes.
Mr. Abel explained that the City of Boulder pays RTD to run service more
frequently than service standards would generally allow. He added that RTD
has done this over the years, perhaps in a more behind the scenes way. He
said the agency is just making it more visible to the Board. He added that
the City of Boulder comes to RTD and says the City of Boulder would like
services to run every 10 minutes, not every 15 minutes. He said that RTD
agrees to provide the service at a fixed cost. He further added that all
communication with the City of Boulder has been that they wish to continue
this program.
Director Lubow asked about the JUMP that goes to Lafayette. She asked if
Lafayette was piggybacking on Boulder’s service improvements.
Mr. Carter remarked that the route is primary in Boulder and drops down to
the lower frequency when it serves Lafayette.
Mr. Abel said that there have also been times when Boulder county has
supplemented the City of Boulder funding when they want buy ups into
county portions of services.
Director Lubow asked if that has been happening recently.
Mr. Carter replied no.
Director Tisdale asked about the R Line changes. He added that he has not
had a chance to digest exactly how that works. He stated that this is the
first he has heard about the rebranding of the R Line into the H Line. He
noted that none of the public hearings is in the Southeast area and they
would be the people most impacted by the R Line change. He said that
Director Mihalik’s constituents and his constituents might be well served if a
public hearing were held there. He added that it is a big change and people

Director Menten inquired how many airport workers will be affected by the
changes and if there is some kind of special communication required.

6.D

will ask questions. He further added that Denver City Councilman, Kevin
Flynn, wanted to know about C and D Line changes.

Mr. Carter mentioned that the agency is still working with the Five Points
Business Association. He further added that the agency is working with the
association to incorporate some of their ideas to make changes to the plan.
Director Broom stated that there has been no positive input that has come
back but that several things have been pointed out to him. He said that the
R Line has only been in operation a short period of time and started in the
middle of winter. He said multiple projects have broken ground on the line
and reducing services would be a bait and switch.
Mr. Carter said the agency is looking to maintain the 15-minute frequency
on the line, not just during the peak periods. He stated that, within the City
of Aurora, the frequency stays the same. He added that, if a developer
planned his/her development on the level of service being provided by the R
Line, that still remains. He further added that the line does not go down to
an area that is not using it, which is the Denver Tech Center. He said the
change affects how long trains are on the line going down to Lone Tree, and
even in the peak period with the highest demand, service for the Tech
Center area is still maintained at the current level.
Director Walker commented that he noticed the changes to C and D Line and
did not get a call from any of the councils that are in District D. He said that
it shows that there is still some demand for a central downtown service in
the Southwest.
Mr. Carter remarked that there is demand and the change is complex. He
explained that the L Line actually changes the frequency on the D line as
well. He said that, instead of having a 10-minute frequency during the peak
period, that gets turned down to 15 minutes, which is offset by the fact that
the agency will be able to add all four car trains to the D line. He added,
capacity wise, the agency is still good on the D Line in that respect. He
further added that the agency is also offering the L Line which should
improve the on time performance of the D Line as well.
Packet Pg. 34

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Aug 8, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Mr. Carter said he would provide the information. He added that one of the
changes made to the C and D Line proposal as it related to the L Line was
Saturday service into downtown Denver, which has been modified in this
current plan. He further added that although staff looks forward to using the
C Line in later evening periods, because a lot of special events occur
throughout the year that are better served by C Line than the D Line, the
agency is still looking at the idea of having the D Line still come up on
Saturday and Sunday.

6.D

Director Francone asked for more detail about the Conifer and the Evergreen
routes.
Mr. Carter said that the agency is trying to go a little earlier to make better
meets at Federal Center Station with the W Line.

Mr. Carter stated that the discontinuance is due to not utilizing RTD services
and provides a safer turn for drivers. He said he would contact Director
Francone regarding the EV ridership the following day.
Director Francone noted that RTD does service changes three times a year.
Mr. Carter added that they are typically done in January, May, and August
to work out with school schedules.
Director Francone said that she has been spending a lot of time in Evergreen
and Conifer and they have a lot to say. She said that RTD never holds
meetings there and that she would follow up with staff to set aside some
time.
Chair Hoy asked to define some terms for him. He asked what the bus stop
consolidation means.
Mr. Carter stated that the concept was introduced in May when the agency
talked about service on Colorado Boulevard and on Broadway. He said the
agency did an analysis on ridership on each of the stops and decided to
consolidate. He added that the agency is aiming to speed up the service. He
further added that RTD has routes that have stops that are less than 200
feet apart which is counterproductive when trying to move a route down the
road.
Mr. Abel stated that over the years the agency often gets request for new
bus stops and RTD grants them, then over time the agency sees stops on
every block.
Chair Hoy asked whether the key thing is bus stop consolation is eliminating
certain stops that are not available.
Director Williams stated District A has no trains but a lot of bus services.
She said that the changes and consolations have been a very good thing.
She further added that this proposal leads to our pervious discussion which
is trying to live within the agency’s budget. She said the five councils that
she deals with are aware of what is going on and are okay with it.

Director Francone asked about the discontinuance of the service from Front
Range and the ridership on the EV.

6.D

Director Solano asked how the consolidation of bus stops would affect the
ADA community.
Mr. Carter stated that that is why the agency has the public hearing process
and that the ADA community did contribute to the process.

Mr. Carter remarked that he will look more into it.
Director Walker asked how long the original G Line was in service.
Mr. Carter said about a year.
Director Walker asked if the demand is there and if it will ever come back.
Mr. Carter stated that the R Line covers a lot of what G Line did.
Director Walker asked if RTD has enough buses to cover that route.
Mr. Abel said yes, but probably not enough branded buses at the moment.
Director asked how much time would be added to a person’s trip under the
proposed changes when transferring from the R Line to the H Line.
Mr. Carter said 5-7 minutes between Lines R and H and 5-7 between Lines E
and F.
Committee Chair Anderson stated that she received a call that day regarding
Routes 89 and understands that people in that area are trying to come
together and retain that service.
Mr. Carter said that there are a couple of things that are going on in the
area. He explained that the Stapleton Transportation Management
Association is trying to provide a shuttle service between Northfield and the
Stapleton property. He added that at the same time there is service in
Anschutz and the agency is trying to speak to the people that provide the
Anschutz shuttle to see if they might take over some of the responsibilities.
He said that 115 boardings per day is extremely low ridership from an area
that is going from suburban to urban.

Salud clinic. They say the Route 62 is great but they have to walk too far.

• Lost Service Hours Update 8 8 17

He stated that, in terms of year-to-date, the agency experienced 1,700
hours of lost services compared to 2,500 hours for last year, which is a
positive note. He said that the agency will continue working both internally
as well as with the agency’s contract partners to do everything that the
agency can to enhance the recruitment and retention efforts, so that the
agency finds itself in a better position in terms of head count and can lessen
the lost service. He said that the agency will continue to monitor and report
back each month.
He stated that he spoke last month about a possible November service
change in conjunction with opening up Civic Center. He said that the agency
will not be implementing the change in the way the staff is used to, that the
background in all of our computer system and get the information necessary
to communicate downstream to our customers. He said minor changes will
take place with accessing egress to Civic Center and new gate assignments.
He added further that the agency will be making some internal adjustments
in computer system.
Mr. Abel stated that there is a BYD noise update. He said that the agency
did communicate last month that RTD would have noise makers on board of
all of the new BYD shuttles, and all shuttles by the end of July. He said that
the agency did do that. He added that the agency has 33 of the new BYD
mall shuttles updated.
He added that he wanted to share that the agency has finalized plans for an
autonomous vehicle demonstration. On Wednesday August 16, 2017, at
Pepsi Center. He said that it will take place between 10am-3pm. He added
that the agency is doing this in conjunction with TransDev, one of the
agency’s contractors that working with EZ Ride Taxis, an autonomous
vehicle manufacturer.
Director Lubow asked about Director Solano’s the irate call from a
constituent regrading one of the buses that did not show late at night and
asked if there are standard operating procedures for such an event.
Mr. Abel said there are procedures and that he would speak with Director
Solano about details on that.

Packet Pg. 37

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Aug 8, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Mr. Abel said that the monthly review is somewhat disappointing, because
the agency is trending upward again. He added that there were 315 lost
service hours in July 2017 compared to 103 last year. He added the trend is
not one the agency likes to see.

6.D

Director Walker asked if there have been any comments about the sound of
electric buses from individuals in the blind community.
Mr. Abel said he received comments after the previous meeting from Gary
Van Dorn, who sent an email thanking the agency for making this change.

He stated that there is a New York Times article about the Lexington Line in
New York containing a chart that shows the number of trips dropped per
day. He said the line must operate millions of passenger hours and
recommended that Mr. Abel read the article.
Director Solano asked about the lost service hours. He said he thinks there
should be a calculation of lost services hours due to driver no show.
Mr. Abel explained that the report does show that on the missed runs and
pull out delay items. He said that both of those indicate either an operator
not showing at all or showing late.
Director Solano asked whether the number gone down.
Mr. Abel remarked that the year-to-date total has gone down, but year-overyear the number has gone up.

D. Other Matters
Committee Chair Anderson noted there were no other matters.

Barbara McManus, Executive Manager of the Board Office, responded that Gerald
Stoll, Lead Service Desk Technical Specialist, was the only retiree who had
committed to attend.
Chair Hoy noted the agenda contained only two unanimous consent items, one
regarding a contract with HTNB and the other for bank signature authorizations,
and no recommended actions. He said both items should be straightforward and no
executive session was scheduled.

Chair Hoy asked which RTD representatives would be required to sign off on the
bank signature authorization resolution.

General Manager Genova confirmed that the authority would still rest under the
committee and noted that the account would be used to take care of remaining
commitments and would fall in line with rest of the agency’s financial reporting.
Chair Hoy likened the account to an escrow account used in the purchase of a
house.
Director Menten asked for confirmation that RTD had no other unexpected
obligations for the maintenance of Denver Union Station other than what had
previously been stated.
General Manager Genova confirmed that the account would be used for normal
upkeep of the property.
Director Menten asked for confirmation that the City and County of Denver would
take care of the roads in front of and behind Union Station.
Chair Hoy said that RTD does not pay for road maintenance unless the agency
owns the road.
General Manager Genova confirmed but noted that RTD does maintenance on the
16th Street Mall and performs snow removal in certain areas.

moving the August 15th Board agenda to the full

instructing his team to look at consolidating obligations in order to get away from
convening for 15-minute meetings. He said that is the focus and that the calendar
is being built for next year.

Chair Hoy agreed. He said that the Board would try to make meetings more
efficient and that the committee could meet on any off Tuesday if issues arise
requiring a meeting.
General Manager Genova said that he had looked at the following year and asked all
of the Assistant General Managers to be strategic. He said they know when items
will come up and has asked them to look 18 months out to avoid having overly
large agendas. He said that the Operations and Customer Service (Ops) and
Financial Administration and Audit (Finance) meetings should be regular monthly
meetings, because there are always items to report. He said the thinking is that the
Government Relations (GR) and Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee
(PCP FT) Meetings could be moved to every other month and that Civil Rights
Meetings could be held on the nights those two committees are scheduled to meet.
Chair Hoy said the agency would be organizing its meetings better. He said the
Board does not want to meet if staff has nothing to talk about.
Director Deadwyler asked whether all recommended actions are critical.
General Manager Genova said it depends on the timing and that staff would try to
be conscientious. He said that, for example, the September 5 meeting had already
been canceled due to lack of discussion topics.
Ms. McManus said that September looked to be a light month even after the
cancellation of the September 5th meeting and said that the following meetings
would not be overburdened. She mentioned that the FasTracks project is gearing
down and there is not as much new material to be presented.
Chair Hoy said the agency probably would not talk about starting up new lines.
Director Menten asked when the agency would next look at N Line.
General Manager Genova said that nothing was planned for September and that a
presentation could be given in October. He said that RTD has been in talks and

Packet Pg. 41

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Aug 10, 2017 12:00 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Deadwyler said she hoped that doing so would not create a pile-up on the
next month’s meeting agenda, causing the meeting to last half the night.

6.E

Director Deadwyler said that General Manager Genova had spoken about the
University of Colorado A Line at the previous meeting. She said that his
presentation had been positive, but she learned that the agency would have to file
for another waiver extension. She asked whether there would ever be an end to the
project. She stated that the people in her district are saying that the University of
Colorado A line should be shut down and that they cannot get any rest. She added
that she had personally heard the piercing sound of the train horns up close.
General Manager Genova replied that he had mentioned to the Board the need for a
waiver extension. He said that previous talks with the Federal Railroad
Administration (FRA) had led RTD to believe that the design documents the agency
had submitted would be sufficient to satisfy the FRA’s demands. He said that,
following that meeting, the agency received a call from the FRA stating that they
needed time to review the documents and that they suggested filing for the waiver
extension. He noted that the University of Colorado A Line and the B and G Lines
are the top priorities.
Director Deadwyler asked whether the delay was driven by paperwork.
General Manager Genova responded that the FRA had approved RTD’s crossing
designs but still needed to know how to measure whether the agency met those
designs. He said that piece is what needs to be approved. He said that RTD has
also been in conversation with the Colorado Public Utilities Commission (CPUC)
regarding the next filing process. He said that RTD is in a 30-day waiting period
from the date of the previous filing, which will expire after Labor Day. He said that
the CPUC would also decide on how the agency is performing and that it is unclear
whether the CPUC will make a ruling right away or convene a hearing. He said that
RTD wants to have a conversation with the CPUC to attempt to have the G Line
approved for crossing testing. He also noted that more than one person at the FRA
would need to grant approval.

back-and-forth legal proceedings with contractor, though he noted that everyone
involved wants to find the best way to move forward and discuss a reasonable
solution. He said he had reached out to the CEOs of the contractors involved and
stated another person at Balfour, one of the companies involved, had reached out
to him, which is a good sign. He said the agency did not have anything new in
terms of schedule or of RTD delays that would cause the agency to pay more
money to the contractors. He said a decision has not been made regarding the
entity that will operate and run the N Line but noted that options would be
presented to the Board in October.

6.E

Director Deadwyler asked whether RTD can give the FRA a deadline.
General Manager Genova said the agency is pushing hard and is in contact with the
person who signs the waivers. He said that person is aware and is doing what he
can, but he noted there are other forces in the FRA to manage.

Director Deadwyler said that the Board knows that but the people in the affected
areas do not and no longer believe the agency.
Chair Hoy said that would not believe it until they see it.
Director Menten, referring back to the meeting streamlining proposal, asked
whether the GR and Civil Rights (CR) Committees would meet as needed
General Manager Genova said that CR would meet twice each year or as needed
and that GR would meet every other month. He said the legislative reports would
still be included in the packet.
Ms. McManus noted that legislative reports are included weekly during the
legislative session.
Director Menten asked for confirmation that the Ops and Finance meetings would
still take place monthly.
Chair Hoy said that those committees would need to meet every month because
they are important and their topics cover what the agency does every day.
Ms. McManus noted that, in order to get timely information, Ops and Finance
Meetings would need to continue to take place during the second week of the
month.
Director Menten said that, as the Board heard in previous Finance meeting, the
agency has lean times ahead. She said she wanted to voice her concerns regarding
the Board’s direction to staff on where to go and how they should interpret that.
She also noted that questions arose when she was signing checks two weeks
earlier and asked for confirmation that the agency receives a discount by paying the
credit card statement before a certain date, which Ms. McManus confirmed.

Chair Hoy said he felt Director Deadwyler’s pain but noted that the project has
progressed quite a bit in the last 60 days.

Director Menten continued by saying that the agency pays credit expenditures prior
to the time the employees fill out their backup documentation. She said that, in
reviewing the credit statement, certain things stuck out. Specifically, she
mentioned an expenditure for a teambuilding exercise as part of the MAX Program
and the purchase of memberships in local chambers of commerce. She said that
RTD should not be putting forth any funding that goes toward campaign issues and
stated that chambers of commerce are notorious for giving money to ballot issues
and candidates. She said that the Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce (DMCC)
has donated to many campaign issues and causes. She asked how the agency
could guarantee that its contributions to chambers were not used for campaigns.
Chair Hoy said that, generally speaking, if a chamber endorses a candidate,
position, or ballot issue, that contribution comes from a separate collection of funds
from partner entities.
Director Deadwyler said that, when she worked with the A. Phillip Randolph
Institute, fundraising was accounted for in a different part of the institute’s ledger
and did not go into the general fund.
General Manager Genova said that he would check with DMCC to see how they
handle political contributions.
Chair Hoy said that chambers use the same model.
Director Menten asked how the agency would check with the rest of the chambers
to which it belongs.
Chair Hoy said that he was a member of the Adams County Political Action
Committee, which was loosely affiliated with North Metro Chamber. He said that
membership dues did not go toward campaigns.
Director Deadwyler said that the chambers are responsible for their own federal
reporting.
General Manager Genova said he would ask DMCC whether their practices are
typical among chambers.
Director Menten asked how many Directors attend chamber meetings.
Director Deadwyler said she personally did not attend.

Chair Hoy said that the agency is involved in the Aurora Chamber.

Chair Hoy agreed with Director Menten but said that there are bigger things to go
after. He said that fees paid to the Arvada Chamber would not make or break the
agency. He said he would like us to focus on things that would really make a
difference.
Director Deadwyler said she does not think the agency should be checking with
chambers on how they do their accounting.
Chair Hoy said he did not see anything wrong with checking.
Director Menten said that she was uncomfortable signing the check for the
teambuilding exercise.
General Manager Genova reiterated that the event is part of MAX week and
mentioned that every credit card statement is reviewed by an Assistant General
Manager.
Ms. McManus stated that adjustments to statements are made and purchases are
questioned on a monthly basis.
General Manager Genova added that audits are continually performed.
Ms. McManus stated that Procurement is involved as well and that they question
documentation line by line.
Chair Hoy said that the agency probably spends $50,000 each month auditing the
bill.
Director Francone reminded the Executive Committee members that four or five
Directors had not yet filled out the General Manager’s performance evaluation
survey and would need to do so by the morning of Friday, August 11, 2017. She
said that those who did not respond would be getting a phone call.

Director Menten said she did not want to drag out the issue but is concerned,
especially as the agency tightens its belt. She suggested she would like to see a
fiscal note drafted for any direction given to staff that would describe the cost of
the item in which the Board has shown interest.

Chair Hoy asked how Director Francone would know who responded if the survey
is anonymous.

General Manager Genova said that the next meeting of the Mobility Choice
Blueprint Initiative would be held on Wednesday, August 23 from 3:00 - 4:30 p.m.
at Arrow Electronics. He asked for any attendees to RSVP and stated that the
meeting would be followed by a presentation on technology. He said he would send

Chair Hoy said that one of the best parts of the evening is when the Board recognizes
retires. He noted that there were no retirees for the month of July, but stated that there
was an APTA International Rail Rodeo winner that would be recognized.
Terry Emmons, Assistant General Manager of Rail Operations, thanked the Board for the
opportunity to recognize RTD’s APTA International Rail Rodeo winners. He said that it
was an extremely tight race as always, and while RTD did not get the top award, the
participants did extremely well. He added that the operators were in an unfamiliar vehicle,
so they had to learn how to use it before the rodeo. He noted that the four members from
RTD, both the operator team and maintenance team, attended. He remarked that George
Sweeney from the maintenance team, was in attendance that evening, and they did an
amazing job, finishing in 8th place.
Phil Eberl, General Superintendent, said that Mr. Sweeney had been to the APTA
International Rodeo thirteen times, winning first place and overall in Miami, and winning
overall in Vancouver. He commented that getting to the rodeo is an accomplishment in of
itself and he was very proud of Mr. Sweeney.
Mr. Emmons commented that next year RTD will have the home field advantage, and staff
is looking forward to hosting the APTA International Rail Rodeo next year.

General Manager Genova remarked that RTD is still operating under a waiver from the
FRA, which expires on Sunday, July 30, 2017. He said that on Monday, staff submitted a
petition to have the B Line removed from the waiver since the B Line has one private
crossing that is not under the purview of the FRA. He noted that seemed to be a
reasonable approach, and staff expects to hear back from the FRA by the end of the
week. He explained that the University of Colorado A Line waiver is currently being
developed by staff, and if the FRA approves the changes made to the technical document,
DTP believes that they will be in compliance with federal requirements. He added that
there is also the CPUC order, and they have asked that the at-grade attendants remain in
place until RTD gets through the final CPUC process. He noted that currently, there is a
lot of momentum, and staff is eager to hear with the FRA has to say.
General Manager Genova remarked that the $1.00 hourly wage increase for rail and bus
operators had been implemented and will go into effect on July 30, 2017, and the
increase would show up on their August paychecks.
General Manager Genova added that Lacy Bell, Corridor Planning Manager, had been
accepted as RTD’s nominee for Leadership APTA and said that she would represent RTD
well.
Director Folska said that it was encouraging to hear that RTD is making great strides with
the University of Colorado A Line and B Line. She noted that the people she meets are
excited for the G Line and asked what the plan was for when things do not go right.
General Manager Genova said that things will go well. He remarked that staff needs to
get through this week first to see what the FRA’s response will be. He commented that, if
staff needs to do something else based on the FRA’s recommendations, they will work on
that.
Director Deadwyler asked about the quiet zones along the University of Colorado A Line,
and inquired when they would be implemented. She said that constituents in her district
are miserable and asked if the horn decibels could be lowered.
General Manager Genova remarked that the goal is to get the University of Colorado A
Line certified for quiet zones. He stated that, once RTD is certified through the FRA and
CPUC, the quiet zones can be implemented. He noted that the decibel level is a regulatory

General Manager Genova thanked the Board for the Employee Appreciation Event. He said
that, as employees spread out to other divisions, they do not get an opportunity to see
their friends and this event allowed them to do that.

8.A

Chair Hoy stated that he lives five miles from the B Line and he can hear the train from his
house.
Director Lubow discussed the Mobility Choice Board meeting and reminded the General
Manager that the RTD Board had asked for copies of the minutes from that meeting. She
added that she would also like to see the legal documents regarding Mobility Choice’s
policies and priorities.
Director Francone noted that she had asked staff for a list of the participants on the
Mobility Choice Board and she had not received it yet. She then inquired about the
University of Colorado A Line waivers and how they affected the G Line.
General Manager Genova said that staff has regular conversations with the CPUC to
advance the G Line testing. He noted that RTD had received limited testing permissions
from the FRA and CPUC and all of those tests had been completed. He stated that the
only remaining testing that requires approval is for the crossings and the wireless
crossings. He commented that once the FRA approves the criteria document on the
timing, RTD will request permission to complete the remaining testing for the G Line. He
noted that the CPUC wants to address the University of Colorado A Line amendments first
then work on the G Line, whereas staff would like them to be done in parallel.
Director Francone remarked that Director Anderson gave a stunning presentation at a
meeting with the City of Arvada and everyone was interested to hear about what was
going on in their community. She said that the presentation, along with comments from
the General Manager, will reassure the public that RTD is not sitting back and doing
nothing.
Director Williams asked if the Mobility Choice Board meetings were open to the public.
General Manager Genova said yes and added that the Mobility Choice Board is still
working through the draft bylaws that will memorialize open meetings.
Director Williams asked that the RTD Board be notified beforehand so that they could
attend.
Rolf Asphaug, General Counsel, remarked that the Memorandum of Understanding says
that they will operate in the spirit of the Colorado Open Meetings Law.

requirement, and the horns are in the 90 decibel range. He remarked that other methods
could possibly be used, such as wayside horns, which do not have as big of an impact.

Director Folska commented that Arvada cannot wait for their commuter rail service to

Unanimous Consent
Chair Hoy suggested that if there were any questions or need for discussion of an agenda
item, a Director should request it be removed from the unanimous consent agenda.
Director Folska asked that the Contract with INIT for Automatic Passenger Counters for
Light Rail Vehicles be moved to Recommended Actions.
Director Menten said that she would like the Approval of General Manager's 2018 Goals

Passenger Counters (APCs) with INIT Innovations in Transportation, Inc. (INIT) (Contract

Counter).
Motion:

Director Anderson made the motion to approve
the Contract with INIT for Automatic Passenger
Counters for Light Rail Vehicles.
Director Deadwyler seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Director Folska said that to her this passenger counter seems
like redundant technology and asked why RTD needed this
service.

in the 2017 Amended Budget. It is further recommended that the General Manager or his
designee be authorized to issue contract amendments in the total amount not-to-exceed
the remaining approved project budget of $845,393 as needed.

Bruce Abel, Acting Chief Operations Officer/Assistant General
Manager of Bus Operations, said that the answer lies in the
fact that in terms of rail the fare purchase process is separate
and apart from the boarding process. He said that the purpose
of the Automatic Passenger Counters (APCs) is to be able to
count the number of boardings assigned to the various routes.
He added that the APCs will allow staff to better understand
what services people are using.
Director Folska commented that she would be a no vote for
this item. She said that there is other technology available
that would generate income instead of spending it.
Mr. Abel added that in addition, the APCs will also monitor the
on-time performance of rail.

Discussion:

Director Menten said that in the past, as a member of the
committee, she tried to set a higher level for exceeds
expectations. She stated that in reality, nothing has changed
in this proposal from previous years and at the end of the day,
this is gauged to decide how much of a performance bonus
the General Manager will be awarded. She stated that since
this evaluation is tied to a monetary gift, the expectations
should be set to a higher bar, so she would be a no vote for
this item.
Director Francone stated that she was disappointed to hear
that Director Menten’s concerns were not addressed
beforehand. She added that the entire Board was welcome to
attend the General Manager Performance and Oversight
Committee, and if a Director wanted to speak with her, her
phone was always on. She added that she was disappointed
to know that Director Menten was not pleased with the
recommendation.
Director Menten stated that in the past she did not see enough
change in the committee and added that she did not know
what else could have been done.

There was no Executive Session.

Director Folska asked for someone to explain to her how much money in reimbursements
the District receives from Medicaid.
General Manager Genova stated that there were zero reimbursements.
Mr. Abel added that, while there were no reimbursements, Medicaid has purchased fare
media from RTD for their clientele.
General Manager Genova said that staff would have to research those figures.
Director Folska asked that those numbers be sent to the Board.
Director Anderson remarked that Arvada has a vibrant Olde Town that is full of business
and has been a Transit Oriented Development (TOD) even before RTD had transit. She
stated that it is a great community and it has one of the lowest crime rates in the metro
area.

Director Menten asked when the Board would receive a list of all of RTD’s property
holdings as she wanted to know everything that RTD had.
General Manager Genova said that the surplus properties list would include all properties
with no transit plan. He then inquired if Director Menten wanted a list of all RTD owned
properties, not just surplus.
Director Menten said yes. She added that she wanted to know about everything and said
that the Board could go through the list to determine what properties could be sold.
General Manager Genova said that staff would research the available format of the
information and will inform the Board as to what kind of effort would be required to
compile a list.
Chair Hoy said that the list Director Menten is requesting actually exists because there is a
list of over 500 properties.
Director Francone commented that the Board received an update from the General
Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee with the core and task goals

Subject:

Recommendation for Contract Award to HNTB
for FasTracks Systems Engineering Consultant
Services

General

Board Meeting Date: August 15, 2017

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize award of a five-year contract with an option for a one-year extension with HNTB
Corporation in the not-to-exceed amount of $22,368,708 for Systems Engineering consulting work.
BACKGROUND
In May of 2017, RTD advertised a Request for Proposals for professional services for a Systems
Engineering Consultant for FasTracks and Base system capital programs and state of good repair
projects for RTD. This contract will award work and authorize budget based on a work order system.
On 6/27/17 RTD received one proposal from the HNTB Corporation.
RTD put together a team with representation from Purchasing, Civil Rights, Quality Assurance, Systems
Engineering and Program Management to evaluate the proposal submitted by HNTB according to the
following evaluation criteria:
Proposals were evaluated according to the following criteria, listed in descending order of
importance:

The evaluation team rated and scored the HNTB proposal and found them to be fully compliant with all
of the evaluation criteria. Based on the proven performance by HNTB in the proposal on RTD and similar
transit systems nationwide, the evaluation team recommended that RTD move forward with award of
the contract to HNTB for Systems Engineering Consulting services.
DISCUSSION
RTD has used a single Systems Engineering Consultant for FasTracks and Base systems for consistency
and standardization of design. This approach has saved RTD cost and has facilitated the operation and
maintenance of the system. The incumbent Systems Engineering Consultant six-year contract has been
extended once and will have been in place for 12 years by December of 2017. For this reason, RTD
reexamined our needs and advertised for these services in order to secure a Systems Engineering
consultant to complete the FasTracks capital construction program and continue to support RTD’s Base
systems operations and maintenance.

ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks
Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize award of a five-year contract with an option for
a one-year extension with HNTB Corporation in the not-to-exceed amount of $22,368,708 for
Systems Engineering consulting work.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Reconsider the System Engineering approach to project
management and design. This is not recommended as RTD does not currently have the specialized
staff to meet the System Engineering needs of the FasTracks Program and Base System. Selection of
alternative two could delay implementation of the FasTracks Program and state of good repair on the
Base system.

Board Meeting Date: August 15, 2017

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the attached Bank Account Signature Authorization Agreement (the “Agreement”).
BACKGROUND
Wells Fargo, as the District’s commercial bank, requires prompt notification of all modifications in the
authorized signatories on the District’s various bank accounts. In order to reflect any changes in District
personnel and the election of new Board officers, the Agreement is updated at least annually and
periodically as otherwise required.
DISCUSSION
The attached recommended Agreement has been modified from the previously approved Agreement only
to reflect the addition of a new checking account which will be used solely for paying invoices related to
the winding down of the Denver Union Station Project Authority (DUSPA). Funds deposited in this
account will be transferred to RTD from the DUSPA. The creation and use of this account will enable
RTD to clearly account for the remaining DUSPA funds as DUSPA’s remaining obligations are paid over
time.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
This recommended Board action poses no financial impact to the District.
ALTERNATIVES:
1.
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors approve the attached Bank Account Signature Authorization Agreement (the
“Agreement”).
2.
Modify the attached Agreement.
Do not adopt the attached Agreement.
