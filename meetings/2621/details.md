## IV. Retiree Awards

Chair Hoy noted there were four retirees of the month of August, and one was in attendance: Gerald A. Stoll.

Brett Feddersen, Manager of Shared Technical Services, stated that Gerald Stoll, Lead Service Desk Analyst, worked for him as lead at the service desk. He explained that the position included answering phone calls, making sure the computers worked, helping people, and being the first responder. He stated that last fall, when he was in the lobby, bragging about Colerain High School, Mr. Stoll overheard him and told him he went there, too. He stated that they concluded that Mr. Stoll went to the same high school at the same time as his father. Mr. Feddersen said it was an amazing coincidence that 1,500 miles apart, 50 years later, he got the pleasure of working with someone who went to school with his father. He stated that Mr. Stoll has devoted his life to RTD. He explained that Mr. Stoll worked as a bus driver, in accounting, and with IT. He said he basically built the foundations for the agency’s service desk, help desk, and the customer service ethic that agency has now. Mr. Fedderson added that Mr. Stoll had been a mentor to the other members of the RTD service desk, and that he was honored to have gotten to know him and work with him.

Mr. Stoll stated that he enjoyed working at RTD. He said he started out as a bus driver and enjoyed it very much until, after a couple of years, his wife pointed out that she only saw him 14 hours a week, including hours of sleep. He stated that was when he got interested in accounts payable. He noted that, as a bus driver, seniority counted and that was what got employees everywhere in the company. He added that RTD had been really good to him and he hoped he had been just as good to RTD in the long term as well.

Chair Hoy thanked Mr. Stoll and added that retiree awards were always the highlight of the Board Meetings. He further added that it was great to see such dedicated hard working employees.

## V. Public Participation

Chair Hoy stated that public participation was open to anyone who wanted to address the Board. He reminded the audience that each speaker was allowed three minutes. Saoirse Charis-Graves, City of Golden, stated that she was a Council Member from the City of Golden and she knew Director Tisdale from Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) and Director Anderson from Jefferson County Transportation Advisory Group (JEFFTAG). She added that she appreciated that Director Menten attended the most recent City Council Meeting to advise them of the proposed changes related to the W Line service. She further added that she knew the agency was not voting on the W Line changes at that time but that it might not be too early to share some of her thoughts. Ms. Charis-Graves stated that Golden City Council, along with the Mayor, the City Manager, and the city staff, were extremely dismayed by the proposed changes. She added that Golden had been an active promoter of the W Line from the day it opened. She said that every year the City Council approves funds to expand their support of transit options and education for citizens and visitors on how they can access the public transit. She stated that she personally advocates to her neighbors and to her constituents that taking the light rail is a significant way to support their community, both the immediate Golden community and the greater Front Range community, in reducing vehicle congestion and different kinds of pollution. She further added that the Golden Call-n-Ride system had been, by all reports, one of the most successful, if not the most successful in RTD from the very beginning. She noted that Golden continues to invest more money into the local Call-n-Ride Route to and from the station and said that the expansion of their Call-N-Ride system is based on the input from their residents and businesses as to what can be done to make it easier to use. She stated that the City of Golden had increased their funding for alternative ways to get to and from the light rail station in Golden, such as eventually installing a bike share station.  Ms. Charis-Graves stated that cuts to the W Line would impact not just Golden residents and visitors, but also those more vulnerable populations who need access to the VA clinic, Human Services, and to the County Government Building. She noted that those were critical centers in their county and the City of Golden should not be throwing up more barriers to access them if it can be avoided. She said at the very least she would ask the agency to consider a reduction to services after peak service hours and weekends. She explained that, if the agency must consider reducing service time, it is important to keep the day time service at 15-minute intervals. She further added that RTD could monitor the performance for one year and then have another discussion. She thanked the Board for listening and stated that hopefully the Board could consider her comments tonight.

## VII. General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Update

Director Francone stated that the General Manager mid-year survey process has been completed and that 12 out of the 15 Directors completed their surveys and returned them. She stated that she understood there were some problems returning the surveys for a couple of the Directors. She noted that there will be one more survey in October 2017. She added that the Board Office is ready, willing, and able to assist Directors as needed in completing the surveys. She further added that she will keep reminding the Directors about the survey as the time gets closer. Director Francone noted that the agency has a contract negotiation coming up for General Manager Genova. She said that his contract expires in December 2018 and that the agency is looking at the possibility of a contract negotiation for next year. She added that the committee will be working in 2018 towards that goal. Chair Hoy remarked that, for clarification, those Directors who had not filled out the latest survey will not be able to because it has closed, but in the future Directors can go to the Board Office and get assistance if they need to.

Director Lubow asked for a recap of the CDOT presentation.

General Manager Genvoa stated that Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) presented a summary of a couple of different options that they have looked at, going from Fort Collins down to Pueblo. He said that the presentation reviewed two or three different routes, but the one he was really intrigued with was the route that would come right to the middle of Denver but would share the agency’s infrastructure. He said that an example is the North Metro Line and on the light rail. He stated that DRCOG presented some pros and cons of the different options and added that all options were in the $10,000,000,000 - $11,000,000,000 range. He further added that there is no real plan to move anything ahead just yet, given those funding requirements. He said that CDOT also presented Bustang information and explained how bussing was done this year and last year. He said that CDOT had actually increased their ridership and revenue and discussed possibly adding some other stops on their Fort Collins to Denver route, as well as their Colorado Springs to Denver route. He stated that he would see if he could get the presentation to the Board.

Director Tisdale stated that CDOT did not talk about how they ran Bustang from Denver International Airport to an Eagle Regional Airport in Eagle, Colorado. He added that CDOT has an east west connection along I-70. He further added that he thought the Board would enjoy seeing the statistics relative to Bustang and then relative to the cost on various fixed rail and bus for the north south corridor.

Director Menten stated that she had conversations with some of the staff that dealt with the Bustang program at CDOT and she was curious whether this report included subsidies. She added that when she talked to people from CDOT their statement was that they do not include capital, because if CDOT did that it would just look horrible. She further added that she knew it was outside of what the committee had to focus on at the moment, but she was interested to know.

General Manager Genova stated that CDOT did not share that kind of information but said he would check in with them to see what he could find out.

Director Francone remarked to Director Lubow that the presentation was part of the DRCOG package that the committee received. She added that she would be happy to share that with Director Lubow.

Director Francone asked Mr.Van Meter for a copy of the Inter Regional Connectivity  (ICS) study for 2016-2017.

## XI. Unanimous Consent

Chair Hoy stated that there were two items on the unanimous consent agenda. He commented that if any Director had a change, or questions, they should request that action item be pulled from the Unanimous Consent agenda and moved to Recommended Actions.

Motion:               Director Tisdale made the motion to approve items A and B on the unanimous consent agenda.

Director Anderson seconded the motion.

### A. Recommendation for Contract Award to HNTB  for FasTracks Systems Engineering Consultant Services

It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize award of a five-year contract with an option for a one-year extension with HNTB Corporation in the not-to-exceed amount of $22,368,708 for Systems Engineering consulting work.

It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize award of a five-year contract with an option for a one-year extension with HNTB Corporation in the not-to-exceed amount of $22,368,708 for Systems Engineering consulting work.

### B. 2017-005 : Approval of Bank Signature Authorization

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors approve the attached Bank Account Signature Authorization Agreement (the “Agreement”).

BACKGROUND

Wells Fargo, as the District’s commercial bank, requires prompt notification of all modifications in the authorized signatories on the District’s various bank accounts.  In order to reflect any changes in District personnel and the election of new Board officers, the Agreement is updated at least annually and periodically as otherwise required.

DISCUSSION

The attached recommended Agreement has been modified from the previously approved Agreement only to reflect the addition of a new checking account which will be used solely for paying invoices related to the winding down of the Denver Union Station Project Authority (DUSPA).  Funds deposited in this account will be transferred to RTD from the DUSPA.  The creation and use of this account will enable RTD to clearly account for the remaining DUSPA funds as DUSPA’s remaining obligations are paid over time.

FINANCIAL IMPACT

This recommended Board action poses no financial impact to the District.

ALTERNATIVES:

1.                   It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors approve the attached Bank Account Signature Authorization Agreement (the “Agreement”).

2.                   Modify the attached Agreement.

Do not adopt the attached Agreement.

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors approve the attached Bank Account Signature Authorization Agreement (the “Agreement”).

##### a. 2017 Resolution - 005 Bank Account Signature Authorization Agreement

## XII. Recommended Action

There was no recommended action.

## XIII. Executive Session

There was no executive session.

## XIV. Old Business

Director Lubow stated she had submitted a General Manager’s Response (GMR) request and instead received a notice about a non-GMR (NGMR). She added that the agency had different request processes and she just wanted to make sure the General Manager got to see citizens’ concerns. She further added that she did not know how was determined which GMR’s made it to the General Manager and which did not.

General Manager Genova stated that he was familiar with all of the GMRs, whether was a NGMR or GMR. He explained that the difference was that a NGMR does not have his signature and it would be up to an Assistant General Manager (AGM) level. He added that, when an NGMR comes in, it might be received through the Board Office or via email that a Board Member sent directly to him. He further added that he would make a determination based of the breadth and scope of what the issue was, whether it lends itself to a narrower response, or whether it was a broader response that he would need to forward to others. He stated that, in the Board Office, Executive Manager Barbara McManus and her team made those decisions as well.

Director Lubow asked if he would see the NGMRs anyway.

General Manager Genova said yes, and that the NGMRs were tracked every week. He explained that every week in the agency’s senior leadership team (SLT) meetings the agency had a tracking sheet of all of the GMRs and NGRMs, their status when they came in, and who they were assigned to.

## XV. New Business

Director Francone stated that, in the spirit of former Director Kent Bagley, she wanted to report out two of the field trips that she went on. She stated that on August 4th she joined the Employer Supporting Guard and Reserve (ESGR) organization. She explained that ESGR is a liaison group between employers and members of the National Guard and Reserve that are employed with them. She stated that she got to ride on a C130 out of Peterson Air Force Base and that it was stunning. She added that the take away from that experience was that she used to think that, when people were on Reserve or Guard duty leave they just goof around, but the truth of it was that those people were actually training. She said they were active and up to date with whatever the security protocols were and were ready to go. She gave a big thank you to the agency and all employers who retain Reserve and Guard employees and allow them to be there for our country in case they need to deploy. She stated that her second field trip was with Bike JEFFCO on August 9th. She gave thanks to Mike Meader, the Allied Barton staff that came along with her, and Assistant General Manager of Rail Operations Terry Emmons for loaning her Phil Eberle, General Superintendent of Light Rail Vehicle Maintenance. She added that the comments from the Bike JEFFCO group were very appreciative and that they told her they were overwhelmed with support that RTD showed. She added that Bike JEFFCO expressed they were very appreciative of the opportunity to highlight some of the issues with taking a bike on the public transportation systems.
