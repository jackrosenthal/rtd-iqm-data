In adopting this recommended action, the agency demonstrates its commitment to meet the Strategic
Priority of Financial Success.
RTD is contracted with Hilltop to provide municipal advisory services. Hilltop has provided required
advisory services for myriad bond and certificate of participation (COP) issuances and refinancings for
the agency, coordinated with RTD’s credit rating agencies, and performed several ancillary advisory
services such as financial evaluation of unsolicited proposals.
The current contract with Hilltop expires in March 2022. By adopting this recommended action, the
Board authorizes a one-year extension of the contract that would allow Hilltop to assist with a timesensitive refinancing of 2013 and 2014 series COPs to realize significant interest savings. This
refinancing is time-sensitive due to call provisions as well as the potential for reduced interest savings
from a refinancing delay with the anticipated rise in long-term interest rates in 2022.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Insurance Payment Budget Transfer

Committee Meeting Date:
February 8, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
February 22, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve a budget transfer of $795,857 from the Unrestricted Fund balance
to insurance expense for insurance premiums paid to insurers.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD entered insurance contracts with Zurich Insurance (Zurich) to provide an Owner Controlled
Insurance Program (OCIP) during construction of the N Line to provide insurance coverage for the
agency’s contractors. Providing OCIP during construction is a common practice.
DISCUSSION
In adopting this recommended action, the agency demonstrates its commitment to meet the Strategic
Priority of Financial Success.
Insurance contract premiums are quoted and priced based on certain assumptions at the beginning of the
insurance contract period. Insurers will often perform an audit of the coverages at a later time to ensure
the premiums are adequate for the insurance being provided.
Zurich performed an audit of the N Line OCIP coverages and determined in late 2021 that the premiums
paid by RTD needed to be increased by $795,857. It was also determined that Zurich and Marsh USA
(Marsh), the agency’s insurance broker, collectively owed a refund to RTD of $639,824 and $300,825,
respectively, for a total refund of $940,649 for certain coverages that were overcharged.
The combined financial impact to RTD is a net return of premiums of $144,792; however, Zurich and
Marsh must first receive the $795,857 in underpaid premiums before refunding the $940,649 to RTD.
In order to adhere to RTD’s budgetary controls to appropriate the $795,857 payment to Zurich, a budget
transfer must be completed. Following payment by RTD of the $795,857, Zurich and Marsh will then
send payment of $940,649 to RTD.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The financial impact of this action item will be a net return of premiums to RTD of $144,792.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Salaried Trustee Appointments

Committee Meeting Date:
February 8, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
February 22, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve Resolution No. ______, Series of 2022, reappointing Bill Van Meter,
Assistant General Manager, Planning, to a term expiring December 31, 2023, appointing Leah Riley,
Chief Administration Officer, to a term expiring December 31, 2023, and appointing Kent Enwright,
Manager, Labor Relations, to a term beginning April 1, 2022 and expiring December 31, 2022, as
Trustees for the Salaried Employee Defined Benefit Pension Plan (pension plan) and Salaried Employee
Defined Contribution Retirement Plan (DC plan).
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 min
BACKGROUND
On January 8, 2008, the Board of Directors adopted Resolution No. 001, Series of 2008 (Resolution No.
001), which established a committee composed of the Board Chair, the Chair of the Salaried Employee
Pension Trust Fund, and the Finance Chair (i.e., the Chair of the Finance Administration and Audit
Committee as it existed at that time) to screen applications from prospective pension and DC plan
trustees from among “the middle management salaried employee class and the senior management
salaried employee class and…[to] bring recommendations back to the Board.”
As a revision to the process established in Resolution No. 001, the Board adopted Resolution No. 27,
Series of 2010, which stated that, “for reappointment of Trustees who have served satisfactorily and in
whose education the Trusts have made substantial investments, it is not necessary to seek applications
for renewal, and instead the application process established by the Board in 2008 would be used on
those occasions when the Board finds it necessary or appropriate to appoint new salaried Trustees to
the Trusts.”
On May 31, 2016, in Resolution No. 008, Series of 2016 (Resolution No. 008), the RTD Board of
Directors amended the Defined Benefit Pension Trust and the Defined Contribution Retirement Trust
(Trusts, collectively) to remove the “senior” and “middle” management distinction established in
Resolution No. 001. Instead, Resolution No. 008 authorized the Board to appoint two employee trustees
who participate in the pension plan and two who participate in the DC plan, as well as two Directors
appointed to the Trusts and the Chief Financial Officer who is a permanent member of the Trusts, to
serve as the same trustees on both trusts.
DISCUSSION
In adopting this recommended action, the agency demonstrates its commitment to meet the Strategic
Priorities of Financial Success and Employee Ownership.
The appointments and reappointment are as follows:

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
House Bill 22-1026 Board Position

Committee Meeting Date:
February 17, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
February 22, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt a support position on House Bill 22-1026, “Concerning the
replacement of the income tax deduction for amounts spent by an employer to provide alternative
transportation options to employees with an income tax credit for amounts spent by an employer for
that purpose,” as the bill was introduced.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Davies, Government Relations Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
Pursuant to the Board-adopted 2022 Legislative Program, the agency developed a Legislative Program
that serves as a guiding document for staff to pursue goals related to legislative and policy matters. A
Legislative Program serves as a living document that can be adjusted throughout a legislative session to
provide an avenue for Board adopted policy positions to be communicated and pursued by agency staff.
DISCUSSION
In adopting this recommended action, the agency demonstrates a commitment to meet the Strategic
Priority of Financial Success.
HB22-1026 replaces an existing state tax credit that was underutilized with a new refundable tax credit
for 50% of the expenses incurred by employers who purchase alternative transportation for employees.
Transit passes, such as EcoPass, are included among expenses eligible for the tax credit. Businesses that
qualify for this proposed tax credit include corporations, partnerships, joint ventures, common trust
funds, limited associations, pool or working agreements, or limited liability companies. Additionally,
included in this bill are reporting requirements for businesses that utilize the proposed tax credit to
ensure accountability that the funds are being used to actually benefit employees commuting to work as
intended.
Tax credit programs have been utilized around the nation both at the national and state level. HB221026, if enacted, would offer one of the largest incentives at the state level anywhere in the nation.
RTD staff, in consultation with the agency’s state lobbyist, has determined that the bill would further
encourage employers throughout the Denver metro region to offer transit passes to employees, thereby
increasing agency revenues.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no direct agency financial impact associated with the Board’s adoption of this recommended
action.
