Board Meeting Date:

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
accept and enter into the record the District’s audited financial reports relating to the year ended
December 31, 2018 as prepared by staff and audited by RTD's independent auditor, RubinBrown, LLP.
GM CORE AND TASK GOALS MET
Core Goal #3: Strong Financial Management
Task Goal #3: Ensure Fiscal Sustainability
BACKGROUND
State statutes require an annual audit by independent certified public accountants. RTD is also required
to provide annual audited financial statements to external entities and other government organizations to
be in full compliance with legal covenants, debt agreements, and other contractual documents. The
accounting firm of RubinBrown, LLP performed the 2018 audit. In addition to the requirements set forth
in state statutes, the audit also was designed to fulfill the requirements of the federal Single Audit Act of
1984 and related OMB circular A-133.
DISCUSSION
As stated in the auditor’s unmodified opinion, the financial statements in the enclosed Comprehensive
Annual Financial Report (CAFR) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of RTD as of
December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flow for the 2018 and
2017 fiscal years in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors accept and enter into the record the District’s audited financial reports relating to the
year ended December 31, 2018 as prepared by staff and audited by RTD's independent auditor,
RubinBrown, LLP.
2. Do not accept and enter into the record the audited financial reports relating to the year ended
December 31, 2018 as prepared by staff and audited by RTD’s independent auditor, RubinBrown,
LLP. This is not the recommended action, since state statutes and other sources, such as rating
agencies and other legal covenants, require RTD to enter annual audited financial statements into
the record.

Regional Transportation District

Board of Directors
Regional Transportation District
Denver, Colorado
In accordance with Colorado statutes and Regional Transportation District (RTD) bylaws, the enclosed Comprehensive Annual Financial
Report of the Regional Transportation District as of December 31, 2018, has been compiled. Responsibility for the accuracy of the
presented data and the completeness and fairness of the presentation, including all disclosures, rests with RTD. Management believes
the data, as presented, fairly sets forth the financial position and operating results of RTD. Disclosures necessary to enable the reader
to gain the maximum understanding of the financial affairs of RTD have been included.
In developing and evaluating RTD’s accounting system, consideration has been given to the adequacy of internal accounting controls.
These controls are discussed by the Chief Financial Officer in the Letter of Transmittal. Within that framework, we believe RTD’s
internal accounting controls adequately safeguard assets and provide reasonable assurance of the proper recording of financial
transactions.
This report has been prepared according to the guidelines recommended by the Government Finance Officers Association of the United
States and Canada. In accordance with these guidelines, the accompanying report is presented in three parts:
1.

Introductory Section, including the Chief Financial Officer’s Letter of Transmittal.

2.

Financial Section containing the independent auditor’s report, Management’s Discussion and Analysis, the financial
statements, notes thereto and supplemental information.

3.

Statistical Section, including selected tables of unaudited data depicting the financial history of RTD, demographics, and
other miscellaneous information.

Colorado law requires the governing bodies of local governments to have an independent audit of RTD’s financial statements
performed. RTD has complied with this requirement and has included the report of the independent auditors in the Financial Section
of this report.
Preparation of this Comprehensive Annual Financial Report could not have been accomplished without the dedicated efforts of the
entire financial staff. Should you have any questions or comments, please contact Heather McKillop, Chief Financial Officer.
Respectfully submitted,
Doug Tisdale
Chair, Executive Committee

April 29, 2019
Mr. Doug Tisdale
Chair, Executive Committee
Regional Transportation District
State law requires that all general-purpose local governments publish within seven months of the close of each fiscal year a
complete set of financial statements presented in conformance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and
audited in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards by a firm of licensed certified public accountants. Pursuant
to that requirement, we hereby issue the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report of the Regional Transportation District (RTD)
for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.
This report consists of management’s representations concerning the finances of RTD. Consequently, management assumes
full responsibility for the completeness and reliability of all of the information presented in this report. To provide a reasonable
basis for making these representations, management of RTD has established a comprehensive internal control framework that
is designed both to protect the government’s assets from loss, theft, or misuse and to compile sufficient, reliable information
for the preparation of RTD’s financial statements in conformity with GAAP. Because the cost of internal controls should not
outweigh their benefits, RTD’s comprehensive framework of internal controls has been designed to provide reasonable rather
than absolute assurance that the financial statements will be free from material misstatement. As management, we assert that,
to the best of our knowledge and belief, this financial report is complete and reliable in all material respects.
RTD’s financial statements have been audited by RubinBrown, LLP, a firm of licensed certified public accountants. The goal of
the independent audit was to provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements of RTD for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2018, are free of material misstatement. The independent audit involved examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements; assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management; and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. The independent auditor
concluded, based upon the audit, that there was a reasonable basis for rendering an unmodified opinion that RTD’s financial
statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, are fairly presented in conformity with GAAP. The independent
auditor’s report is presented as the first component of the Financial Section of this report.
The independent audit of the financial statements of RTD was part of a broader, federally mandated “Single Audit” designed to
meet the special needs of federal grantor agencies. The standards governing Single Audit engagements require the independent
auditor to report not only on the fair presentation of the financial statements, but also on the audited government’s internal
controls and compliance with legal requirements, with special emphasis on internal controls and legal requirements involving
the administration of federal awards. These reports are in RTD’s separately issued Single Audit Report.
GAAP requires that management provide a narrative introduction, overview, and analysis to accompany the basic financial
statements in the form of Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A). This letter of transmittal is designed to complement
the MD&A and should be read in conjunction with it. RTD’s MD&A can be found immediately following the report of the
independent auditors.
REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT (RTD)
RTD provides public mass transit service to the Denver metropolitan area. In 1969, the Colorado General Assembly (Assembly)
found that public transit was a necessary part of the growing Denver Metropolitan Region. The Assembly found that public

7

Regional Transportation District

1.B.1.a

sector involvement was the best method to ensure the continuation of this vital component. Thus, the Regional Transportation
District was created as a political subdivision of the State effective July 1969 “to develop, maintain, and operate a public
mass transportation system for the benefit of the District.”

Since 1983, RTD has had a fifteen-member Board of Directors that are elected by their constituents to serve four-year terms
to govern RTD. There are approximately 200,000 residents per director district. The RTD Board of Directors is responsible for
setting policy, overseeing the agency’s annual budget, and establishing short and long-range transit goals and plans in concert
with local, state, and federal agencies.
RTD employs over 2,779 men and women, making it one of the largest employers in the eight county areas. In addition, RTD
contracts with private carriers to provide access-a-ride, fixed route and commuter rail services employing over 2,058 men and
women. Besides its administrative headquarters in Denver, RTD has seven operating facilities (excluding purchased
transportation services), including four in Denver, one in Aurora, one in Englewood, and one in Boulder.
The financial reporting entity includes all of the financial activities of RTD, as well as those activities of its component unit,
the Asset Acquisition Authority, Inc. (the Authority), a nonprofit corporation established to facilitate RTD’s use of
lease/purchase financing.
RTD also maintains budgetary controls. These controls ensure compliance with legal provisions embodied in the annual
appropriated budget approved by RTD’s Board of Directors. The budget sets forth proposed outlays for operations, planning,
administration, development, debt service, and capital assets. The level of budgetary control (that is, the level at which
expenditures cannot legally exceed the appropriated amount) is established at the project level.
The annual budget serves as the foundation for RTD’s financial planning and control. All departments of RTD are required to
submit requests for appropriation to the General Manager on or before August 1st of each year. The General Manager uses
these requests as the starting point for developing a proposed budget. The General Manager then presents this proposed budget
to the Board of Directors for review prior to October 15th. The Board of Directors is required to hold a public hearing on the
proposed budget and to adopt a final budget no later than December 31st.
Unused appropriations lapse at year-end, except that the Board of Directors has the authority, as stated in the adopted
appropriation resolution, to carry-over the unused portion of the funds for capital projects not completed, for a period not to
exceed three years.
RTD’s policy also authorizes the General Manager to approve certain line-item transfers within the budget. Budget-to-actual
comparisons are provided in the Supplemental Information Section of this report.
Factors Affecting Financial Condition
The information presented in the financial statements is perhaps best understood when it is considered in the broader
perspective of the specific environment within which RTD operates.
RTD serves the eight-county region considered the Denver metropolitan area. It is the most populated area of the state and
the economic barometer of Colorado. Employment in the Denver Metro area is dominated by small businesses. These companies
represent a diverse mix of industries and are located throughout the Denver metropolitan area, providing a geographic balance
in employment centers.

RTD boundaries now include Jefferson, Boulder, and Denver counties, most of the City and County of Broomfield, and portions
of Adams, Douglas, Weld, and Arapahoe counties. Over 3.08 million people reside within RTD’s 2,342 square mile area.

On November 3, 1992, the voters of Colorado approved a Constitutional Amendment (the “Amendment”) that limits taxes,
revenue, and spending for state and local governments effective December 31, 1992. On November 7, 1995, the voters of the
District exempted RTD from the revenue and spending limitations concerning the Amendment through December 31, 2005. On
November 2, 1999, the voters of the District further exempted RTD from the revenue and spending limitations outlined in the
Amendment for the purpose of paying any debt incurred to finance the construction of the Southeast and Southwest light rail
lines or to operate such for as long as any debt remains outstanding, but in no event beyond December 31, 2026.
On November 2, 2004, the voters of the District authorized an increase in the District’s sales and use tax rate from 0.6% to
1.0%, effective January 1, 2005, to finance the FasTracks transit improvement program. This authorization also exempted
the District from any revenue and spending limitations on the additional tax and on any investment income generated by the
increased tax revenue, and allowed RTD to incur debt to finance the capital improvements included in the FasTracks program.
At the time that all FasTracks debt is repaid, the District’s sales and use tax rate will be reduced to a rate sufficient to operate
the transit system financed through FasTracks.
Long-term Financial Planning
Each year the Board of Directors adopts a financially balanced Mid-Term Financial Plan (MTFP), which is the six-year operating
and capital improvement plan for RTD including both the Base System and FasTracks. This plan was previously made up of
two separate components known as the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) for the Base System and the Annual Program Evaluation
(APE) for FasTracks. The MTFP is a component of the long-term transportation planning program for the Denver metropolitan
area evaluated by the Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG). While the MTFP is developed separately for the Base
System and FasTracks, RTD integrates both plans into a single medium and long-term Financial Plan which includes the entirety
of RTD in a single report. This financial information forms the basis for the development of RTD’s annual budget.
Long-term financial planning seeks to allocate resources among related and, at times, competing activities and to optimize
those resources in a manner consistent with defined organizational goals and objectives.
FINANCIAL INFORMATION
RTD management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an internal control structure designed to ensure that assets
are protected from loss, theft, or misuse and that adequate accounting data are compiled to allow for the preparation of
financial statements in conformity with GAAP. RTD has designed its internal control structure to provide reasonable, but not
absolute, assurance that these objectives are met. The concept of reasonable assurance recognizes that: (1) the costs of a
control should not exceed the benefits likely to be derived and (2) the valuation of costs and benefits requires estimates and
judgment by management.
Single Audit: As a recipient of federal assistance, RTD is responsible for ensuring that an adequate internal control structure
is instituted to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations related to those programs. This internal control
structure is subject to periodic evaluation by management and the RTD internal audit staff.

The Colorado Legislative Council (CLC) in its March 2019 report forecasts that the economy is expected to grow at a more
moderate pace; demographic change, growing inflationary pressures and rising interest rates will slow consumer spending.
Economists for CLC reported the following key economic indicators:

1.B.1.a

Fiscal Policy: RTD follows a fiscal policy approved by the Board of Directors annually or as necessary due to modification.
The fiscal policy contains policies for revenue, investments, expenditures, capital improvements, fund balance, debt, budgeting,
accounting and grants.
Debt Administration: RTD formulates its debt policy to protect its credit ratings and soundly manage its assets and liabilities.
Included in this policy is a requirement that debt will not be used to finance current operations. Another requirement precludes
financing capital projects beyond the useful life of the project. Additional policies go beyond these essential guidelines and
result in further protection. RTD has a dual rating for its 1.0% sales tax credit. Moody’s Investors Service rates the sales tax
credit as “Aa1”, Standard and Poor’s Corporation rates the sales tax credit “AAA” and Fitch Ratings rates the sales tax credit
“AA” that are secured by the 0.6% sales tax. Moody’s Investors Service rates the sales tax credit as “Aa2”, Standard and
Poor’s Corporation rates the sales tax credit “AA+” and Fitch Ratings rates the sales tax credit “AA” that are secured by the
0.4% sales tax.
Cash Management: The main objective of RTD’s cash management program is the protection of investment principal while
providing optimal levels of cash throughout the year. The RTD investment policy is modified periodically to adapt to changes
in eligible investments, benchmarks, and specific objectives.
During the year, RTD invested its cash in various investment vehicles including money market funds, U.S. Treasury securities,
agency securities, discount notes, commercial paper, repurchase agreements, and variable and fixed rate mortgage-backed
securities. The total average return on investments for the year was 1.4%.
Risk Management: RTD employs a combination of self-insurance and purchased insurance in its efforts to protect assets and
control and prevent losses.
The areas of self-insurance are worker’s compensation, automobile and general liability. RTD is self-insured for liability, the
limits of which are $387,000 per person and $1,093,000 per occurrence as specified under the Colorado Governmental
Immunity statute. The self-insured retention for worker’s compensation claims is $2,000,000 per claim, with any amounts
above this covered by purchased insurance up to the legal limits of liability under the Colorado worker’s compensation statute.
Commercial insurance policies provide property coverage up to $500,000,000 for buildings, their contents, and rolling stock
(other than collision); a Commercial Crime Policy with a limit of $10,000,000; a $5,000 bond for CDL Testing Performance
Bond; $2,600,000 Workers’ Compensation Bond; Felonious Assault Policy; travel insurance for employees on RTD business;
fiduciary coverage on the Trustees of the Union Pension Trust, Salaried Pension Trust, Represented Health and Welfare Union
Trust, Legal Trust, and the employees administering the health benefits program for salaried employees with a limit of
$8,000,000; Cyber Liability policy with a limit of $10,000,000; Drone policy with a limit of $10,000,000. With the growth of
Light Rail Transit (LRT) services, and Commuter Rail Transit (CRT) services. RTD has added Railroad Protective and Railroad
Liability commercial insurance policies that provide coverage when required under operational needs.
OTHER INFORMATION
Independent Audit: State statutes require an annual audit by independent certified public accountants. The accounting firm
of RubinBrown LLP was selected to perform the 2018 audit. This audit also was designated to meet the requirements of the
Federal Single Audit 2 CFR 200.501, Uniform Grant Guidance and related 2 CFR 200, Uniform Grant Guidance – Uniform
Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles and Audit Requirements. The auditor’s report on the financial statements and

As part of RTD’s single audit, tests are made to determine the adequacy of the internal control structure, including that portion
related to federal financial assistance programs, as well as to evaluate RTD’s compliance. RTD’s single audit for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2018 found no instances of material weakness in the internal control structures or significant
violations of applicable laws and regulations. A separate report was prepared for this purpose.

1.B.1.a

schedules are included in the Financial Section of this report. The auditor’s report related specifically to the single audit is
included in a separate report.

In order to receive the Certificate of Achievement for Excellence in Financial Reporting, RTD must publish an easily readable
and efficiently organized Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the contents of which must conform to program standards.
This report must also satisfy both GAAP and applicable legal requirements.
The Certificate of Achievement is valid for one year only. We believe our current Comprehensive Annual Financial Report meets
the program’s requirements and will be submitting it to the GFOA to determine its eligibility for another certificate.
Acknowledgements: Preparation of the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report on a timely basis was made possible by the
dedicated services of the entire staff of the Finance Division. Each member of the division has our sincere appreciation for the
contributions made in the preparation of this report.
Finally, without the leadership and support of the members of the RTD’s Board of Directors, preparation of this report would
not have been possible.
Sincerely,
Heather McKillop
Chief Financial Officer

Financial Reporting to RTD for its Comprehensive Annual Financial Report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. This

Report On The Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the Regional Transportation
District (RTD) as of and for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 and the related
notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise RTD’s basic financial
statements as listed in the table of contents.
Management’s Responsibility For The Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial
statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America; this includes the design, implementation and maintenance of internal
control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditors’ Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our
audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits
contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the
United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material
misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditors’
judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial
statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor
considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the
financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of
the entity’s internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also
includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

1.B.1.a

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to
provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Opinion
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of RTD as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the changes
in its financial position and its cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Other Matters
Required Supplementary Information
Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that
the management’s discussion and analysis and pension plan summary information on
pages 23 through 35 and 87 through 90, respectively, be presented to supplement the
basic financial statements. Such information, although not a part of the basic financial
statements, is required by Governmental Accounting Standards Board, which considers
it to be an essential part of financial reporting for placing the basic financial statements
in an appropriate operational, economic or historical context. We have applied certain
limited procedures to the required supplementary information in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which consisted
of inquiries of management about the methods of preparing the information and
comparing the information for consistency with management’s responses to our inquiries,
the basic financial statements and other knowledge we obtained during our audit of the
basic financial statements. We do not express an opinion or provide any assurance on the
information because the limited procedures do not provide us with sufficient evidence to
express an opinion or provide any assurance.
Supplementary And Other Information
Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the financial
statements that collectively comprise RTD’s basic financial statements. The
accompanying budgetary information, introductory section and statistical section are
presented for purposes of additional analysis and are not a required part of the basic
financial statements.

1.B.1.a

The budgetary information is the responsibility of management and was derived from
and relates directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the
basic financial statements. Such information has been subjected to the auditing
procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements and certain additional
procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the
underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements
or to the basic financial statements themselves, and other additional procedures in
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America.
In our opinion, the budgetary information is fairly stated, in all material respects, in
relation to the financial statements as a whole.
The introductory and statistical sections have not been subjected to the auditing
procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements, and accordingly, we do
not express an opinion or provide any assurance on them.
Other Reporting Required By Government Auditing Standards
In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report dated
April 29, 2019 on our consideration of RTD’s internal control over financial reporting and
on our tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts and
grant agreements and other matters. The purpose of that report is to describe the scope
of our testing of internal control over financial reporting and compliance and the results
of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on internal control over financial reporting
or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with
Government Auditing Standards in considering RTD’s internal control over financial
reporting and compliance.

The management of the Regional Transportation District (RTD) offers users of our financial statements this narrative overview and analysis
of the financial activities for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. This discussion and analysis is designed to assist the reader
to focus on significant financial activities and identify any significant changes in the financial position of RTD. It should be read in conjunction
with the financial statements that follow this section. All amounts, unless otherwise indicated, are expressed in thousands of dollars.
Key Reporting Implementations
In fiscal year 2016 RTD implemented the provisions of Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Statement No. 72, Fair Value
Measurement and Application, which would generally require state and local governments to measure investments at fair value. GASB's
goal is to enhance the comparability of governmental financial statements by requiring fair value measurement for certain assets and
liabilities using a consistent definition and accepted valuation techniques. This standard expands fair value disclosures to provide
comprehensive information for financial statement users about the impact of fair value measurements on a government's financial position.
Financial Highlights
As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, total assets and deferred outflows of resources of RTD exceeded total liabilities and deferred inflows
of resources by $3,463,506 and $3,413,509 respectively. The amount of unrestricted net position as of December 31, 2018 was
$(207,306) compared to $(223,204) in 2017. RTD’s unrestricted net position was negatively impacted by the implementation of GASB
Statement No. 68, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions (GASB 68). GASB 68 required RTD to record the amount of unfunded
pension liabilities. More information on the pension plans is available in the Notes.
The net position of RTD increased by $49,997 during the current year compared to an increase of $91,157 in the previous year. The
increase for 2018 and 2017 was due to higher operating revenues, sales and use tax and grant revenues, net of increases in operating
expenses and non-operating expenses which resulted from an improving economy combined with revenue enhancement and expense
reduction initiatives undertaken by RTD.
RTD’s sales and use tax revenues are its largest single source of revenues. These tax revenues increased $36,005 (6.0%) in 2018 and
increased $34,589 (6.1%) in the previous year. In 2018 and 2017, The District experienced growth in tax revenues due to increased
consumer and business-spending activity as the District continues to experience population growth in both years of 1.4%, low unemployment
of 3.3% and 2.7% as well as growth in personal income of 5.4% and 5.8%, respectively.
For 2018, total operating expenses exceeded total revenues resulting in a loss before non-operating revenue and expenses of $713,392
compared to a loss of $683,158 for 2017. The increase in operating loss for 2018 and 2017 was mostly due to FasTracks launch of A
and B line depreciating assets for a full year and betterments for the North Metro and Southeast Corridor Extension build-outs. RTD
anticipates operating losses, as these losses are subsidized by non-operating sales and use tax, grant revenues and other miscellaneous
income.
RTD’s total debt decreased $68,788 (2.0%) and decreased $93,317 (2.6%) in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Debt decreased in 2018 due
to payment of principal and 2017 due to the refunding and partial extinguishment of the DUSPA bonds.
Capital grants and local contributions decreased $5,393 (6.2%) in 2018 and decreased 115,840 (57.3%) in the previous year. The decrease
in 2018 was a result of South East Rail Extension being in final phase of completion. The decrease in 2017 occurred as a result of Eagle P3
project construction being in the final phase of completion.
RTD’s capital assets, excluding depreciation, increased $312,270 (3.6%) in 2018 and increased $420,558 (5.2%) in 2017. The increase in
both 2018 and 2017 was primarily due to the build-out of the FasTracks project.

1.B.1.a

1.B.1.a

Management’s Discussion and Analysis serves as an introduction to RTD’s basic financial statements. RTD’s financial statements are
prepared using proprietary fund (enterprise fund) accounting that uses the same basis of accounting as private-sector business enterprises.
Under this method of accounting, an economic resources measurement focus and an accrual basis of accounting is used. Revenue is recorded
when earned and expenses are recorded when incurred.
The basic financial statements are comprised of four components: statements of net position; statements of revenues, expenses and
changes in net position; statements of cash flows; and notes to the financial statements.
The statements of net position presents information on assets and deferred outflows of resources and liabilities and deferred inflows of
resources, with the difference between the two reported as the net position. Over time, increases or decreases in net position may serve
as a useful indicator of whether the financial position of RTD is improving or deteriorating. The statements of revenues, expenses, and
changes in net position presents information on operating revenues and expenses and non-operating revenues and expenses of RTD for the
fiscal year with the difference, the net income or loss, combined with any capital grants and local contributions to determine the change in
net position for the year. That change combined with the previous year-end total net position reconciles to the net position total at the end
of the current fiscal year. All changes in net position are reported as soon as the underlying event giving rise to the changes occurs,
regardless of the timing of the related cash flows.
The statements of cash flows reports cash and cash equivalent activities for the fiscal year resulting from operating activities, capital, and
related financing activities, noncapital and related financing activities and investing activities. The result of these activities added to the
beginning of the year cash balance reconciles to the cash and cash equivalents balance at the end of the current fiscal year. The statements
of cash flows, along with the related notes and information in other financial statements, can be used to assess the following: RTD’s ability
to generate positive cash flows and pay its debt as the debt matures; the reasons for differences between RTD’s operating cash flows and
operating income (loss); and the effect of investing, capital, and financing activities on RTD’s financial position.
The notes to the financial statements provide additional information that is essential to fully understand the data provided in the statements
of net position, statements of revenues, expenses, and changes in net position, and statements of cash flows.
RTD provides bus, paratransit, and light rail service in a 2,342 square mile area in and around Denver, Colorado. The activities of RTD are
supported by a 0.6% and 0.4% sales and use tax collected within the District. The 0.6% sales and use tax is used to fund the Base System
operations of RTD. The Base System operations provide the bus and the majority of current light rail services in the Denver area. The 0.4%
sales and use tax funds the FasTracks build-out program and operation and maintenance of those program elements as well as providing for
enhanced transit services in the District. Additional revenue sources include fare collections, federal, state, and local financial assistance,
investment income, and other income such as advertising and rental income.
Financial Analysis
Condensed Financial Information - Condensed financial information from the statements of net position and statements of revenues,
expenses, and changes in net position is presented below.
Statements of Net Position – As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, total assets and deferred outflows of resources of RTD exceeded
total liabilities and deferred inflows of resources by $3,463,506 and $3,413,509, respectively. The largest portion of this excess, in 2018
and in 2017, was invested in capital assets, net of related debt. RTD uses these capital assets to provide public transportation services to
customers; consequently, these assets are not available for future spending. Although RTD’s investment in capital assets is reported net of
related debt, it should be noted that funding required to repay this debt will be obtained from other sources such as sales and use tax, since
the capital assets themselves cannot be used to pay the related debt. The amount of unrestricted net position as of December 31, 2018
was $(207,306) compared to $(223,204) in 2017. Substantially all of the unrestricted net position, although not legally restricted, has
been appropriated or reserved by the RTD Board for future capital acquisition and reserve policy requirements, and debt liquidation during

the budget process. The deficit balance in Unrestricted Net Position includes an allowance for a Net Pension Liability of $303,435 in 2018
for the represented employee defined benefit pension plan (see Note I). RTD has recognized this liability in its financial statements in
accordance with GASB Statement 68; however, RTD is current in making all required contributions under the collective bargaining
agreement.

In 2018, capital assets net of accumulated depreciation increased $47,169 (0.7%) for acquisition of revenue equipment, buildings, land,
and construction in progress for the projects in the FasTracks program.
Current liabilities decreased $5,284 (2.1%) in 2018 primarily due to lower volume of Ecopass 2019 contracts processed and reduction of
construction contract retention.
Noncurrent liabilities and deferred inflows decreased $85,552 (2.0%) in 2018 primarily due to change in the Net Pension Liability recognition
of deferred resources as require by GASB Statement No. 68, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions, and GASB Statement 71,
Pension Transition for Contributions Made Subsequent to the Measurement Date.
The net position of RTD increased by $49,997 (1.5%) during the current year compared to an increase of $91,157 (2.7%) in the previous
year. The increase in 2018 and 2017 was due to higher operating revenues, sales and use tax collection increases a one-time gain recognized
for a bond refunding, net of increases in operating expenses and non-operating expenses.

Passenger fares – Passenger fares provided 14.6% and 14.2% of total revenues in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Farebox receipts, monthly
and annual pass revenue, and special event fares for bus and rail services are included in passenger fares. Passenger fares increased by
$3,014 (2.1%) in 2018 compared to an increase of $5,595 (4.2%) in 2017. Passenger fares changes in 2018 and 2017 were minimal.
Advertising and other – Advertising and other revenue provided 0.8% and 0.7% of total revenues in 2018 and 2017; this includes revenues
from advertisements primarily on RTD’s buses and external wraps on light rail vehicles. Advertising and other income increased $376 (5.3%)
in 2018 compared to an increase of $1,356 (23.4%) in 2017. The increase in 2018 was minimal. The increase in 2017 was due to an
increase in advertising revenue related to a stronger economy, new rail lines and revenue for lease and naming rights.
Sales and Use Tax – Sales and use tax provided 64.8% and 60.4% of RTD’s total revenues in 2018 and 2017 respectively. Sales and use
tax is a dedicated 1.0% tax imposed on certain sales within the service area. Sales and use tax increased $36,005 (6.0%) in 2018 compared
to an increase of $34,589 (6.1%) in 2017. In 2018 and 2017, the District experienced growth in tax revenues due to increased consumer
and business-spending activity as the District continues to experience population growth of 1.4% and 1.4%, low unemployment of 3.3%
and 2.7% as well as growth in personal income of 5.4% and 5.8%, respectively.
Grant operating assistance – Grant operating assistance provided 8.8% and 8.1% of total revenues in 2018 and 2017. Grant operating
assistance increased $5,991 (7.5%) in 2018 compared to an increase of $3,077 (4.0%) in 2017. The operating assistance is a federal grant
revenue program used to perform capital maintenance and maintain RTD’s revenue fleet of bus, paratransit, and rail vehicles. The increase
in both 2018 and 2017 is the result of grant funding sources being available during the year.
Investment Income – Investment income provided 1.4% and 6.4% of total revenues in 2018 and 2017. Investment income decreased
$49,621 (78.7%) in 2018 compared to an increase of $56,659 (889.3%) in 2017. The decrease in 2018 was due to the 2017 gain from
extinguishment of debt. The increase in 2017 was due to the gain from extinguishment of DUSPA Bonds.
Other Income/Gain on sale of Assets – Other income provided 1.3% and 1.5% of total revenues in 2018 and 2017. Other income
decreased $2,000 (13.7%) in 2018 compared to a decrease of $973 (6.2%) in 2017. Other income includes interest subsidy income, rental
income from retail space, parking, and miscellaneous other items. The decrease in 2018 was due to a onetime gain on asset disposals in
2017. The decrease in 2017 was due to reduction of asset sales, which was primarily attributable to the sale of three Fort Lupton parcels
sold in 2016.

Salaries and wages–Salary and wage expense is the largest expense category accounting for 19.8% and 19.2% of the total RTD expenses
in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Salary and wage expenses increased by $11,364 (6.6%) in 2018 compared to an increase of $8,885
(5.4%) in 2017. Increases in both years occurred from salary and wage performance (result based) and progression increases, and additional
service provided with the openings of new rail lines.
Benefits – Fringe benefits accounted for 5.7% and 10.2% of total expenses in 2018 and 2017. Fringe benefits decreased by $38,449
(42.0%) in 2018 compared to a decrease of $4,947 (5.1%) in 2017. The fluctuations for both 2018 and 2017 is primarily due to
implementation GASB Statement Nos. 68 and 71 establish standards for measuring and recognizing net pension liabilities.
Materials and supplies – The materials and supplies expense category accounted for 5.5% and 5.0% of the total expenses in 2018 and
2017 respectively. Materials and supplies expenses increased $6,649 (14.9%) in 2018 compared to a decrease of $7,494 (14.4%) in 2017.
The increase in 2018 is primarily due to higher diesel fuel and gas prices. The decrease in 2017 is primarily due to a decrease in
diesel/gasoline fuel prices.
Services – Services expense accounted for 8.7% and 8.6% of total expenses in 2018 and 2017. Services expense includes contracted
services such as security services; vehicle, equipment and right of way maintenance services; advertising and marketing services, and legal
services. Services expense increased $3,866 (5.0%) in 2018 compared to an increase of $18,763 (32.0%) in 2017. The increase in 2018
contractual increases and additional security services. The increase in 2017 was primarily due to contract services for betterments for
North Metro Rail and South East Extension projects.
Utilities – Utilities accounted for 1.8% of total expenses for both years 2018 and 2017. Utilities expense includes electric,
telecommunications, water and sewer, and natural gas for facilities. Utilities expense decreased $84 (0.5%) in 2018 compared to an increase
of $2,283 (16.1%) in 2017. The decrease in 2018 was negligible. The increase in 2017 occurred primarily due to traction power costs due
to the opening of the University of Colorado A line and the B Line commuter rail.
Insurance – Insurance accounted for 1.1% and 1.5% of total expenses in 2018 and 2017. Insurance expense includes RTD’s self-insured
cost for general liability and worker’s compensation claims. In addition, RTD purchased insurance in its efforts to protect assets. Insurance
expense decreased $3,378 (25.4%) in 2018 compared to an increase of $2,937 (28.3%). The variation in both years 2018 and 2017 was
due fluctuating frequency and severity of claims.

1.B.1.a

Purchased transportation – The purchased transportation expense category accounted for 19.0% and 17.7% of the total expenses in
2018 and 2017. Purchased transportation represents the costs of contracted transportation services for bus, commuter rail, access-a-Ride,
and FlexRide services. Purchased transportation costs increased $17,365 (10.9%) in 2018 compared to an increase of $2,446 (1.6%) in
2017. The increase in 2018 was due to a higher scheduled payments to DTP included TABOR as well as contractual increases. The increase
in 2017 was due to contractual increases.
Leases and rentals – Leases and rentals include lease expense for office space, office equipment, park-n-Ride facilities, and use of
communication towers. Leases and rentals expense decreased $833 (29.4%) in 2018 compared to a decrease of $459 (14.0%) in 2017.
The decrease in 2018 and 2017 was primarily due to RTD’s reduction of office space due to completion of FastTracks projects.
Miscellaneous – Miscellaneous expense includes other incidental operating expenses not included in other defined categories.
Miscellaneous expenses increased $104 (2.5%) in 2018 compared to a decrease of $30 (0.7%) in 2017. This category includes additional
one-time project expenses creating fluctuations between years.
Depreciation – The depreciation expense category accounted for 30.8% and 27.7% of the total expenses in 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Depreciation expense is a non-cash systematic allocation of the cost of capital assets over the estimated useful life of the assets.
Depreciation expense increased $37,020 (14.9%) in 2018 compared to an increase of $26,479 (11.9%) in 2017. The increase in both 2018
and 2017 occurred primarily due to the FasTracks assets that were placed in revenue service.
Interest expense – The interest expense category accounted for 6.8% and 7.3% of the total expenses in 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Interest expense decreased $2,576 (3.9%) in 2018 compared to a decrease of $11,926 (15.4%) in 2017. The decrease in 2018 is due to
reduced principal resulting in decrease in interest expense. The decrease in 2017 interest expense is due to partial refunding of Sale Tax
Bonds, Certificates of Participation and partial extinguishment and refunding of DUSPA bonds.
Other expense – Other expense includes miscellaneous non-operating expenses not classified in other expense categories. Other expense
decreased $1,516 (50.9%) in 2018 compared to an increase of $1,723 (137.0%) in 2017. The increase in 2017 was primarily due to
issuance costs for 2017A/2017B Sales Tax FasTracks Revenue Bonds while there were no issuance costs in 2018.
Capital Assets – Investments in capital assets include: land and rights-of-way; buildings and improvements; leasehold improvements;
revenue and non-revenue vehicles; shop and service equipment; security and surveillance equipment; computer equipment; and furniture.
RTD’s investment in capital assets, net of accumulated depreciation, in 2018 was $6,851,205 compared to $6,804,036 in 2017. The
increase in capital assets in 2018 was $47,169 (0.7%) compared to an increase of $202,106 (3.1%) in 2017. RTD acquires its assets with
sales and use tax revenues, farebox revenue, federal capital grants, and proceeds from the sale of revenue bonds and certificates of
participation. The increases during 2018 and 2017 were primarily due to the cost of planning, design and construction of FasTracks projects
and fleet acquisition.

Major capital asset events during the 2018 fiscal year included the following:
FasTracks North Metro Corridor - The North Metro Corridor is an 18-mile rail transit corridor between Denver Union Station and 162nd
Avenue, passing through Denver, Commerce City, Thornton, Northglenn and unincorporated Adams County. A construction contract was
entered to complete the commuter rail line from DUS north to 124th Avenue by 2019 with an option to extend construction to 162nd Avenue
if additional funding is identified. In 2018, expenditures related to the North Metro Corridor were approximately $100,582.
East and Gold Line Public-Private Partnership (Eagle P3) RTD was selected for inclusion in the FTA Public-Private Partnership Pilot Program (Penta-P). In 2010, RTD entered into a public-private
partnership to design, build, finance, operate and maintain several of the transit improvements contemplated under the FasTracks program.
The Eagle P3 project is a $2,185,000 project that includes a Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility, the East and Gold Line Corridors as well
as the Northwest Rail Electrified Segment. The Eagle P3 partnership was awarded to a concessionaire, Denver Transit Partners (DTP),
through a competitive bid process culminating in a contract price that was $305,000 below internal estimates. The project is expected to
be fully in revenue service in 2019.
The Eagle P3 project will be completed in two phases. Phase I includes the East Corridor, Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility and design
work for Phase II. Phase II includes the Gold Line Corridor and the Northwest Electrified Rail Segment. The Eagle P3 Project elements are
described below:
FasTracks East Corridor - The East Corridor is a 23.6-mile commuter rail transit corridor between Denver Union Station and Denver
International Airport. The East Corridor opened for revenue service in April 2016.

Certificates of participation - Certificates of participation relate to financial obligations issued by the Asset Acquisition Authority, Inc.
(Authority), a nonprofit corporation. The Authority issued Certificates of Participation (Certificates) with the proceeds being used to
acquire certain equipment and facilities to be used by RTD. RTD leases the equipment acquired with the proceeds from the Certificates
under separate Master Lease Purchase Agreements. For financial reporting purposes, RTD accounts for the Certificates as its own
debt. Certificates outstanding were $1,137,932 and $1,176,397 as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Certificates
outstanding decreased $38,465 (3.3%) in 2018 compared to a decrease of $22,878 (1.9%) in 2017. The decrease in 2018 and 2017 is
due to principal payment reducing debt.
RTD maintains credit ratings from Standard & Poor Corporation, Moody’s Investor Services, and Fitch Ratings. Credit ratings vary based
on the type of debt and the source of funds used for repayment.

Economic Factors and Subsequent Events after adoption of the 2018 Budget
RTD is dependent on sales and use taxes, which are the largest single source of revenue for RTD, representing 64.9% and 60.4% of the
total revenues in 2018 and 2017respectively. Sales and use tax revenues are affected by the local economy in which changes will affect
the level of funding available to RTD during its fiscal year.
RTD is dependent on passenger fares collected for transit services provided. Passenger fares accounted for 14.7% and 14.2% of total
revenues in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Passenger fare collections may be affected by fare levels charged by RTD.
RTD is dependent on federal and local grant funding as well as local capital contributions for both operations and capital expenditures.
Grants and local contributions provided 17.1% and 16.8% of total revenues in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Grant funding and local
capital contributions are only available for use by RTD for qualifying expenditures after appropriation is made by the awarding agency.
Each year, RTD proposes an Amended Budget at mid-year to the Board of Directors for appropriation in order to adjust revenue and
expenditures for the remainder of the fiscal year according to existing economic conditions and fiscal results. RTD may also present
budget amendments to the Board of Directors for approval at any time during the fiscal year to accommodate economic factors.
In June 2018, the Board of Directors approved the 2018 Amended Budget in which the primary changes driven by economic factors were
an increase in fuel prices and wage and contracted services that were driven higher due to the tight labor market and the rising cost of
living in the District.

RTD is in various phases of construction and testing on the Southeast Rail Extension (SERE), the North Metro rail line and the Gold Line.
Each of these FasTracks projects is expected to open for revenue service during the next few years. Additional funding for other capital
projects within the FasTracks project scope have been deferred due to a lack of funding.

1.B.1.a

NOTE A – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The Regional Transportation District (RTD) was created as a transportation planning agency, a political subdivision of
the State of Colorado, by an Act of the Colorado General Assembly (the Act), effective July 1969 (Title 32, Article 9,
C.R.S., 1973, as amended). In 1974, the Act was amended and RTD became an operating entity charged with the
responsibility for development, operation and maintenance of a public mass transportation system for the benefit of
the citizens of the District. The District is comprised of 15 separate districts located in Denver, Boulder, Broomfield
and Jefferson counties, and certain portions of Adams, Arapahoe, Douglas, and Weld counties.
RTD is governed by a publicly elected board of directors consisting of 15 members. Each board member is elected to
serve a term of four years by the constituents of the district in which the board member resides. As required by Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), these financial statements present RTD and its component unit. The
component unit discussed in note A.2 is included in the RTD’s reporting entity because of the significance of its
operational or financial relationship with the District.
In 1988, a Senate Bill was enacted (privatization legislation) requiring RTD to implement by March 31, 1989, a plan to
competitively bid contracts for the provision of at least 20% of RTD’s bus service by private contractors. In 1999, the
Bill was amended requiring RTD to increase this provision to at least 35% of fixed route bus service. In 2003, the Bill
was amended to require that at least 50% of RTD’s vehicular service be operated by private transit companies. In May
of 2007, the legislation was amended to provide for “a system under which up to 58% of the District’s service” is
provided by private contractors.
2. Financial Reporting Entity – Blended Component Unit
The Asset Acquisition Authority, Inc. (the Authority) was formed in 1987 as a nonprofit corporation on behalf of RTD
for the purpose of issuing certificates of participation in a public offering collateralized by an installment purchase
agreement with RTD. RTD’s General Manager appoints the Board of Directors of the Authority. The Authority serves
as a financing mechanism for various financing arrangements for RTD. RTD follows pronouncements 14 and 61 issued
by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board which provides guidance regarding the inclusion of component units
in the primary government’s financial statement presentation. The activity related to the underlying financial obligations
of the Authority has been included as a blended component unit in RTD’s financial statements for the years ended
December 31, 2018 and 2017. No separately audited financial statements are prepared for the Authority.
3. Basis of Accounting
The accounts of RTD are reported as a Proprietary Fund. Proprietary funds are accounted for on the flow of economic
resources measurement focus and use the accrual basis of accounting which reports all assets, deferred outflows of
resources, liabilities, deferred inflows of resources, revenues, expenses, gains and losses. Revenue is recognized when
earned and expenses are recorded at the time liabilities are incurred. Proprietary funds distinguish operating revenues
and expenses from non-operating items. Operating revenues and expenses generally result from providing services and
producing and delivering goods in connection with a proprietary fund’s principal ongoing operations. The principal
operating revenues of RTD are charges to customers for services. Operating expenses include the cost of services,
administrative expenses and asset depreciation. All revenues and expenses not meeting this definition are reported as
non-operating revenues and expenses.
It is RTD’s policy to apply GAAP in its presentation of financial statements. When both restricted and unrestricted
resources are available for use, it is RTD’s policy to use restricted resources first, then unrestricted resources as they
are needed.

1. Organization

1.B.1.a

RTD considers all highly liquid investments, both restricted and unrestricted, with an original maturity of three months
or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
5. Interest Bearing Investments
Investments with a maturity date, when purchased, of less than one year are carried at cost or amortized cost which
approximates fair value. Investments with a maturity date of more than one year from the date of purchase are carried
at fair value.
6. Inventories
Inventories consist primarily of materials and supplies used in the ordinary course of operations. Materials and supplies
are stated at cost using the FIFO (first-in, first-out) method.
7. Other Current Assets
Certain payments to vendors reflect costs applicable to future accounting periods and are recorded as prepaid items.
Escrows are deposits held in escrow during the period of construction. At the time projects are completed, escrows
are generally applied toward the cost of the project or may be forfeited by RTD upon breach of contract.
8. Receivables
Accounts receivable are stated at the amount management expects to collect from outstanding balances. Management
provides for probable uncollected amounts through a charge to earnings and a credit to a valuation allowance based on
its assessment of the current status of individual accounts. Balances that are still outstanding after management has
used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the valuation allowance and a credit to accounts
receivable. Changes in the valuation allowance have not been material to the consolidated financial statements.
9. Restricted Assets
Restricted assets are assets restricted by the covenants of long-term financial arrangements.
10. Capital Assets
Property and equipment are stated at historical cost. Capital assets are defined by RTD as assets with an initial,
individual cost of more than $5 and an estimated useful life in excess of one year. Maintenance and repairs are charged
to current period operating expenses and improvements are capitalized. Upon retirement or other disposition of property
and equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts and any gains
or losses are included in non-operating revenue and expense. A pro rata share of proceeds from the sale of property and
equipment, which were acquired with federal funds, is required to be invested in a similar asset.
Interest is capitalized on assets financed with debt or certificates of participation from the date of the borrowing until
completion of the project. The amount of tax-exempt and taxable debt and certificates of participation (externally
restricted) interest to be capitalized is the difference between the interest expense and interest earnings on issuance
proceeds. The amount of other interest to be capitalized is calculated by weighted average construction expenditures
multiplied by the weighted average interest rate of the outstanding obligations.

11. Depreciation
Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of
the assets, which are as follows:
Land improvements
Buildings
Revenue earning equipment
Shop, maintenance and other equipment

10–20 years
30 years
8–25 years
3–10 years

Fully depreciated assets, which are still in use, are included in the asset balances in the accompanying financial
statements. The cost of fully depreciated assets was approximately $378,780 and $350,394 at December 31, 2018
and 2017, respectively.
12. Deferred Outflows/Inflows of Resources
In addition to assets, the statement of financial position will sometimes report a separate section for deferred outflow
of resources. This separate financial statement element, deferred outflows of resources, represents a consumption of
net position that applies to a future period(s) and thus, will not be recognized as an outflow of resources
(expense/expenditure) until then.
In addition to liabilities, the statement of financial position will sometimes report a separate section for deferred inflows
of resources. This separate financial statement element, deferred inflows of resources, represents an acquisition of net
position that applies to a future period(s) and so will not be recognized as an inflow of resources (revenue) until that
time.
13. Compensated Absences
RTD employees receive compensation for vacations, holidays, illness, and certain other qualifying absences. The
number of days compensated in the various categories of absence is based generally on length of service. Compensated
absences, which have been earned but not paid, have been accrued in the accompanying financial statements.
14. Self-Insurance
Liabilities for property damage and personal injury are recognized as incurred on the basis of the estimated cost to RTD.
In addition, RTD offers a self-insured health benefit option as part of its employee benefits program in which costs are
recognized as they are incurred.

1.B.1.a

15. Revenue Recognition
Passenger fares are recorded as revenue at the time services are performed and revenue is collected from the farebox.
Sales of monthly passes are recorded initially as unearned revenue and recognized as income at the end of the month
for which the pass is used. Sale of MyRide stored value, Mobile ticketing products, ten ride and day pass tickets are
recorded as income at the time of sale. Sales of college based passes, which are valid for a specific academic semester,
are recorded initially as unearned revenue. Sales are recognized as income at the end of each month, with the amount
recognized in each month determined by prorating the total contract amount over the semesters/quarters covered. Sales
of Eco Pass and Neighborhood Pass, which are valid through December 31 of a given year, are recorded initially as
unearned revenue. Sales are recognized as income at the end of each month, with the total contract amount prorated
evenly over the number of months of the contract.
Sales and Use Taxes
Under the provisions of the Act, as amended, RTD levies a sales tax of 1.0% on net taxable sales made within the
District and a use tax of 1.0% on items purchased for use inside the District. As described in Note E, under the terms
of the Sales Tax Revenue Bonds, Series 2007A, Series 2010A, Series 2010B, Series 2012A, Series 2013A, 2016A,
2017A and 2017 B bond resolutions, and TIFIA Sales Tax Loan and Series 2016A, sales and use tax revenue is pledged
for payment of debt service. Sales and use taxes are collected by the State of Colorado, Department of Revenue and
are remitted to a trustee who satisfies debt service from the collections, as required under RTD’s bond resolutions, and
remits the balance to RTD.
Sales and use taxes are recorded as revenue by RTD in the month collected by the merchant. Sales and Use Tax Bonds
debt service will be paid from the collateralized sales and use tax revenues in the amount of approximately $3,839,274
through 2050. Principal and interest paid for the current year and pledged revenues received were $112,777.
Grants and Local Contributions
RTD receives grants from the federal government, through the Federal Transit Administration (FTA). Grants are also
awarded to RTD by state of Colorado through the Colorado Department of Transportation. The federal and state
governments issue grants to RTD for operations and acquisition of property and equipment.
The amount recorded as capital grant revenue was $52,229 and $75,500 in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Operating
assistance grant revenue was $86,403 and $80,412 in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Other contribution revenue was
$28,773 and $10,895 in 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Grants and local contributions are recorded as revenue by RTD once all applicable eligibility requirements are met.
16. Use of Estimates
The financial statements contained herein have been prepared in accordance with US Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles (GAAP). GAAP are uniform minimum standards of and guidelines to financial accounting and reporting. GAAP
establishes appropriate measurement and classification criteria for financial reporting. Adherence to GAAP provides a
reasonable degree of comparability among the financial reports of state and local governmental units. The preparation
of financial statements in accordance with GAAP involves the use of management’s estimates. These estimates are
based upon management’s best judgments, after considering past and current events and assumptions about future
events. Actual results may differ from estimates.
17. Pensions
For purposes of measuring the net pension liability, deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of resources
related to pensions, and pension expense, information about the pension plan’s fiduciary net position and additions

18. TABOR (Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights) – Reserve Composition
Restricted net position represents amounts constrained by external parties or legislation. In 1992, Colorado voters
approved an amendment to the state constitution referred to as the TABOR (Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights) Amendment in
which certain annual limitations were placed on the growth of government revenues. The Amendment also requires
that an Emergency Reserve, referred to as Restricted TABOR, of 3.0% of fiscal year spending excluding debt service
be maintained for all years subsequent to 1994 for declared emergencies.

to/deductions from the plan’s fiduciary net position have been determined on the same basis as they are reported by
the plan. For this purpose, benefit payments (including refunds of employee contributions) are recognized when due and
payable in accordance with the benefit terms. Investments are reported at fair value.

1.B.1.a

NOTE B – DEPOSITS AND INVESTMENTS
RTD’s deposits are subject to the State of Colorado’s Public Deposit Protection Act (PDPA). Under this act, all uninsured
public deposits at qualified institutions are fully collateralized with pledged collateral which is held in custody by any Federal
Reserve Bank or branch thereof, or held in escrow by some other bank in a manner as the banking Commissioner shall
prescribe by rule and regulation, or may be segregated from the other assets of the eligible public depository and held in its
own trust department. Colorado’s PDPA requires that pledged collateral to be held is clearly identified as being security
maintained or pledged for the aggregate amount of public deposits accepted and held on deposit by the eligible public
depository. The depository has the right at any time to make substitutions of eligible collateral maintained or pledged and is
at all times entitled to collect and retain all income derived from those investments without restrictions.
As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, RTD had bank deposits of $33,514 and $5,191 collateralized with
securities held by the pledging financial institutions’ trust department or agent but not in RTD’s name.

Concentration of Credit Risk, it is the policy of RTD to diversify its investment portfolio. Assets held in the investment
funds shall be diversified to eliminate the risk of loss resulting from over-concentration of assets in a specific maturity, a
specific issue or a specific class of securities. The asset allocation in the portfolio should, however, be flexible, depending
upon the outlook for the economy and the securities markets.
RTD’s investment policy outlines the following maximum exposure limits for unrestricted investments. As of December 31,
2018, RTD was in compliance with these limits. As of December 31, 2017, RTD was in compliance with limitations set

In the event that one or more nationally recognized statistical rating agency rates such Agency obligations below the highest rating category, but no
lower than one of the two highest rating categories, RTD’s funds may continue to be invested in Agencies if such investments satisfy the requirements
of CRS 24.75.601.1 (m) which limits the maturity from the date of settlement to three years, provided that the book value limits of CRS 24.75.601.1
(m) (II) shall not apply. Rather, the diversification limit shall be set as follows: no more than 75% of the portfolio may be invested in Agencies, with any
more than 25% being invested in any one Agency.

Proceeds from the issuance of RTD’s obligations are invested in accordance with legal documentation governing the
transaction, notwithstanding any provisions of RTD’s investment policy to the contrary, and do not fall within the maximum
exposure limits listed above.
At December 31, 2018 and 2017, RTD had $307,779 and $396,604 of cash and investments that were restricted under the
provisions of bond agreements.
Fair Value Measurements
In March 2015, the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) released Statement No. 72, Fair Value Measurement
and Application, which would generally require state and local governments to measure investments at fair value. GASB's
goal is enhance comparability of governmental financial statements by requiring fair value measurement for certain assets
and liabilities using a consistent definition and accepted valuation techniques. This standard expands fair value disclosures
to provide comprehensive information for financial statement users about the impact of fair value measurements on a
government's financial position.
Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in an active market for identical assets or liabilities that the District has the ability to
access at the measurement date. Examples derived from NYSE, NASDAQ, Chicage Board of Trade, Pink Sheets.
Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices under Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly
on the measurement date. Examples include Matrix pricing, market corroborated pricing; inputs such as yield curves and
indices.
Level 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability used to measure fair value that rely on the reporting entity's reasonably
available information concerning the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability, including

retired the day before death with a 50% Joint and Survivor Benefit. If death occurs before age 55, payment is deferred until
the participant would have reached age 55 and is reduced for early commencement. Survivors of married participants may
elect to receive an annuity or a lump sum distribution. Survivors of unmarried participants will receive a lump sum distribution
if death occurs while the participant is actively employed with RTD. The lump sum is the present value of the survivor’s pension
above but determined as if the participant was married and the spouse was the same age as the participant.
Termination eligibility is five years of credited service; monthly benefit if not eligible to retire normal retirement benefit, early
retirement benefit, or if elected within six months, a lump sum equal to the present value of the age 65 accrued benefits,
payable in lieu of all other benefits in the Plan. Employee monthly benefit if eligible to retire normal retirement benefit, early
retirement benefit, or a lump sum equal to the present value of an immediate accrued benefit, payable in lieu of all other
benefits in the Plan.

Credited service is one year for each calendar year of 1,000 hours of service (except years and completed months in the year
of transfer). Credited service applies to vesting and service for retirement benefit eligibility. Average final compensation is
average of participant's highest consecutive 36 months of compensation in the last 120 months of credited service immediately
preceding the calendar month in which retirement occurs. Compensation excludes bonuses, severance pay, long-term disability

Actuarial Assumptions
The total pension liability was determined by an actuarial valuation with date of January 1, 2017, using the following actuarial
assumptions applied to all periods included in the measurement with a liability roll forward to December 31, 2017 for
disclosure purposes for the Fiscal Year Ending December 31, 2018:
Inflation
Salary Increases
Investment Rate of Return

3.00%
4.75% - 9.75%, based on age
7.50%, net of investment expenses

The long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments was determined using a building-block method in
which best- estimate ranges of expected future real rates of return (expected returns, net of pension plan investment expense
and inflation) are developed for each major asset class. These ranges are combined to produce the long-term expected rate
of return by weighting the expected future real rates of return by the target asset allocation percentage including expected
inflation.
Best estimates of arithmetic real rates of return for each major asset class included in the pension plan’s target asset
allocation as of the December 31, 2017 (for disclosure purposes for the Fiscal Year Ending December 31, 2018) are
summarized in the following data and reflect assumed long-term expected real rate of return over a 30-year horizon upon
which the disclosure is based:

The actuarial assumptions used in the January 1, 2017 evaluation were based on the results of an actuarial experience study
covering the period January 1, 2009 – December 31, 2013.
Single Discount Rate
The discount rate used to measure the total pension liability was 7.50%. The projection of cash flows used to determine
the discount rate assumed that RTD contributions would be equal to the actuarially determined contribution rate for the
applicable fiscal years. Based on those assumptions, the pension plan’s fiduciary net position was projected to be available
to make all projected future benefit payments of current plan members. Therefore, the long-term expected rate of return on
pension plan investments was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine the total pension liability.
The discount rate does not incorporate nor require a 20-year tax-exempt general obligation municipal bond rate (with an
average rating of AA/As or higher).

RTD Plan – Defined Contribution

The RTD defined contribution plan represents full-time salaried employees hired after January 1, 2008. The RTD Board adopted
amendment No. 8, effective January 1, 2008. RTD contributes 9% of the employee’s qualifying wage. Contributions totaled
$4,246 and $3,981 in 2018 and 2017, respectively. RTD employees cannot contribute to the Plan. Membership was 624 and
596 active employees in 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Amalgamated Transit Union Division 1001 Health and Welfare Trust
The Amalgamated Transit Union Division 1001 Health and Welfare Trust was formed pursuant to a Trust Agreement effective
July 1, 1971, between Amalgamated Transit Union Division 1001 (ATU 1001) and an agent of a transit enterprise owned by
the City and County of Denver, through July 3, 1974, and the Regional Transportation District (RTD) thereafter. In addition
to the original Denver Metro Division, employees of other RTD divisions have been approved for participation in the Trust
benefits. The Trust agreement shall continue in full force and effect in all its terms and provisions so long as there continues
to be a collective bargaining agreement between the Union and RTD.
The Trust provides health benefits (hospital, medical, dental, vision, life and short-term disability) for represented employees
of RTD and certain officers of ATU 1001 and health care benefits for retired employees actively working 600 hours or more
per quarter. The Trust is funded through contribution by the employer and employee, the share of benefit plan contributions is
set by the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA). RTD’s contribution was $19,797 and $19,065 the years ended
December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Trust also provides insurance coverage for felonious assault for each
employee and funds the Amalgamated Transit Union Division 1001 Legal Services Trust. The Trust self-insures part of its
health benefits, life insurance coverage and short-term disability. The plan issues audited financial statements, which include
financial information for the plan. The financial statements may be obtained from the plan: RTD ATU 1001 Health and Welfare
Trust, 2821 S. Parker Road, Suite 215 Aurora, Colorado 80014-2602.
Unearned Compensation Plan
RTD offers its employees an unearned compensation plan (the Plan), created in accordance with Internal Revenue Code
Section 457, which is available to substantially all employees and permits them to defer a portion of their compensation to
future years. Under the terms of the Plan, the unearned compensation is available to participants upon termination, retirement,
death or in the event of an unforeseeable emergency or other financial hardship.
Compensated Absences
RTD considers all accrued compensated absences as due within one year. Employees accrue paid time off (PTO), vacation, and
sick leave based on time in service; employees are not allowed to accumulate more than twice their annual PTO or vacation
accrual and sick leave based on years of service. Employees are paid any outstanding compensated absence balances upon
leaving RTD. RTD records these accrued compensated absences as current liabilities under the principle of conservatism by
assuming these amounts are the most RTD would be obligated to pay in the near-term.

Union Station Alliance (USA) Lease

1.B.1.a

RTD has entered into a number of transactions in which certain of its light rail vehicles have been leased to and subleased
back from certain U.S. and foreign companies and has entered into a transaction in which its maintenance facilities have been
leased to and subleased back. As part of these transactions, RTD irrevocably set aside certain monies (which were received
from each counter party as payment for its leasing of light rail vehicles and real property) with a third party trustee.
The monies held by such trustees will be utilized to make the lease payments owed by the RTD under the transactions and are
therefore considered fully funded and economically defeased.
Capital Projects
As of December 31, 2018, RTD has contracts for the construction of various capital projects and the purchase of buses and
light rail vehicles. The costs to complete these projects and the purchase of buses/light rail vehicles total $254,961 and
$291,877 in 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Grant Match Requirements
Under the provisions of current grants, RTD is obligated to satisfy certain matching requirements of these grants. At
December 31, 2018, RTD had a commitment to provide $33,443 in matching funds in order to receive $84,802 in future
federal and state grant funds.
Privatization Contracts
In response to the privatization legislation (Note A), RTD has awarded contracts for specific groups of routes, not to exceed
58% as required by law for vehicular services. As of January 2018, 54.83% of RTD’s non-rail transit services are delivered
by private contractors operating under the auspices and direction of RTD.
ADA Paratransit Service
With the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), RTD was mandated to provide paratransit service to
the disabled individuals unable to use RTD’s fixed route buses, operating the same days and hours of service as the fixed route
service. This service, called Access-a-Ride, is a curb-to-curb (with door-to-door assistance upon special request) transportation
system offered to disabled individuals who cannot functionally use RTD’s regular fixed route system. Passengers eligible for
Access-a-Ride service must originate their trip within 3/4 of a mile of an RTD non-commuter fixed route. Since September
1996, RTD has been in full compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 requirement to provide paratransit
service to the disabled individuals unable to use fixed route buses.
Future Commitments under Construction Contracts
In 2010, RTD entered into a public-private partnership to design, build, finance and operate several of the transit improvements
contemplated under the FasTracks program, including the Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility, the East Rail Corridor, the Gold
Line Rail Corridor and the electrified segment of the Northwest Rail Corridor (together, the “Eagle P3 Project). The Eagle P3
Project is being delivered and operated under a concession agreement that RTD has entered with a concessionaire that has
been selected through a competitive proposal process. The selected concessionaire is known as Denver Transit Partners (DTP),
a special purpose company owned by Fluor Enterprises, Uberior Investments and Laing Investments.
The Eagle P3 Project construction was completed in two phases with Phase I completed in 2016 and Phase II completed in
2019. Under the terms of the Eagle P3 Project agreement, RTD made scheduled construction payments to DTP from 2011
through 2017 for completed project elements. RTD began commuter rail services on the University of Colorado A Line and the
B Line in 2016 with testing and revenue service of the final corridor, the G Line, expected to occur in 2019. RTD will assume
ownership of the entire project once certain contractual criteria and final completion occurs. Under the terms of the

80

Packet Pg. 85

Attachment: RTD 2018 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (3813 : 2018 CAFR and Report to Governance)

Operating Lease – Purchased Transportation

concessionaire agreement, RTD will make scheduled secured principal and interest payments to DTP from 2017 through 2044
in addition to service payments for the provision of operations and maintenance services by DTP. The principal and interest
payments are fixed amounts for the term of the agreement while the service payments are indexed each year according to
certain inflation measurements. In addition, the service payments may also be adjusted for schedule changes, special services
and certain availability factors.
In 2013, RTD entered a contract with Regional Rail Partners to construct the North Metro Rail Line. The North Metro Rail
Line is an 18.5-mile electric commuter rail line that will run from Denver Union Station through Commerce City, Thornton and
Northglenn to Highway 7 at 162nd Avenue in North Adams County. The North Metro Rail Line is expected to open within the
next few years.
In 2014, RTD entered a contract with Balfour Beatty Infrastructure, Inc. to design and construct the Southeast Rail Extension
Project. The Southeast Rail Extension includes 2.3 miles extending of the existing Southeast Light rail Line from Lincoln Station
through the City of Lone Tree to RidgeGate Parkway Station featuring a new Park-n-Ride with a structure of 1,300 parking
spaces. The Southeast Rail Extension is scheduled to open in 2019.

1.B.1.a

1.B.1.a

RTD contracts with Mansfield Oil Co of Gainesville, Inc. for diesel fuel. The contract is structured as a single year contract.
The estimated (no locked-in price) commitment under the Mansfield contract in 2019 is $20,700. RTD estimates usage of 9.0
million gallons at unit cost of $2.30 per gallon: 5.0 million gallons of RTD’s usage and 4.0 million gallons of RTD private
carrier’s usage.
Contingencies
Federal Grants
RTD receives federal grants for capital projects and operating assistance, which are subject to audit by FTA. Although the
outcome of any such audit cannot be predicted, it is management’s opinion these audits will not result in liabilities to such an
extent that they would materially affect RTD’s financial position.
Self-Insurance
RTD is self-insured for general liability and Workers’ Compensation claims. Liabilities are reported when it is probable that a
loss has occurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In addition, RTD offers a self-insured health benefit
option as part of its employee benefits program in which costs are recognized as they are incurred.
RTD does not carry excess liability insurance for personal injury and property damage. Under the provisions of the Colorado
Government Immunity Act, the maximum liability, with certain exceptions as defined in the Act, to RTD for claims involving
personal injury and property damage is $387 per individual and $1,093 per incident.
For Workers’ Compensation, an excess coverage insurance policy covers individual claims in excess of $2,000. The amount
of settlements has not exceeded insurance coverage in any of the past three years.
RTD’s liability for unpaid claims includes an amount for claims that have been incurred but not reported (IBNR). RTD’s Risk
Management determines incurred claims by investigating the accident and establishing a reserve. Reserves are established on
the day of assignment, reviewed at 30 days and again at 90 days. Reserves are reviewed every 90 days thereafter and based
on ultimate exposure. This amount is included in other accrued expenses in the statement of net assets. Changes in the
balances of claims liabilities for both general liability and Worker’s Compensation during the past year are as follows:

1.B.1.a

RTD is party to a number of pending or threatened tort lawsuits, workers’ compensation claims, or labor/employment claims
under which it may be required to pay certain amounts upon final disposition of these matters. RTD also has certain contract
disputes being considered in contractual dispute resolution proceedings. RTD’s legal counsel estimates that the ultimate
outcome of these matters is sufficiently covered by RTD’s general liability or workers’ compensation reserves, project
contingencies, or insurance, or would not otherwise materially affect the financial statements of RTD.
RTD’s prime contractor for the North Metro Line has asserted claims primarily seeking compensation for delays on the
project. These claims are scheduled for arbitration in late 2018. RTD is contesting these claims and believes it is likely to
prevail.
RTD’s concessionaire has asserted a series of change in law and force majeure claims which, if successful, could entitle the
Concessionaire to monetary relief. RTD is contesting these claims and believes it is likely to prevail.

RTD’s annual budget is prepared on the same basis as that used for accounting except that the budget also includes proceeds
of long-term debt and capital grants as revenue and expenditures include capital outlays and bond principal payments, and
excludes TABOR rebates under Amendment One, extraordinary loss and depreciation on, as well as gains and losses on
disposition of, property and equipment. The budget sets forth all proposed outlays for operations, planning, administration,
development, debt service, and capital outlays for the fiscal year. Prior to October 15, the General Manager submits to the
Board of Directors a proposed operating and capital budget for the fiscal year commencing the following January 1, which is
made available for public inspection and comment. On or before December 31, the budget is adopted in conjunction with an
appropriation resolution by the Board of Directors, who must also approve subsequent amendments thereto. In the absence
of such adoption, RTD has authority to begin making expenditures limited to 90% of the prior year’s approved appropriation.
RTD’s policy on budget transfers authorizes the General Manager to approve certain transfers within the budget.
A reconciliation for the years ended December 31 of the annual budget, as amended, to actual revenue and expenses is as

NOTE J – BUDGETARY DATA

1.B.1.a

In November 1992, Colorado voters passed an amendment (Amendment 1) to the State Constitution (Article X, Section 20)
that limits the revenue raising and spending abilities of state and local governments known as the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights
(TABOR). The limits on property taxes, revenue, and “fiscal year spending” include allowable annual increases tied to inflation
and local growth in construction valuation. Fiscal year spending as defined by the amendment excludes spending from certain
revenue and financing sources such as federal funds, gifts, property sales, fund transfers, damage awards, and fund reserves
(balances). The amendment requires voter approval for any increase in mill levy tax rates, new taxes, or creation of multi-year
debt. Revenue earned in excess of the “spending limit” must be refunded to the taxpayers unless voters approve retention of
these revenues. In addition, the amendment mandates that reserves equal 3% of fiscal spending be established for declared
emergencies.
On November 7, 1995, the voters of the District exempted the Regional Transportation District from the revenue and spending
limitations concerning the Amendment through December 31, 2005. On November 2, 1999, the voters of the District further
exempted RTD from the revenue and spending limitations outlined in the Amendment for the purpose of paying any debt
incurred to finance the Southeast Corridor light rail project or to operate such project for as long as any debt remains
outstanding, but in no event beyond December 31, 2026.
On November 2, 2004, the voters of the District authorized an increase in RTD’s sales and use tax rate from 0.6% to 1.0%,
effective January 1, 2005, to finance the FasTracks transit improvement program. This authorization also exempted RTD
from any revenue and spending limitations on the additional tax and on any investment income generated by the increased tax
revenue, and allowed RTD to incur debt to finance the capital improvements included in the FasTracks program. At the time
that all FasTracks debt is repaid, RTD’s sales and use tax rate will be reduced to a rate sufficient to operate the rapid transit
system financed through FasTracks. RTD has $3.477 billion in authorized debt, subject to the Amendments’ limitations. This
debt was authorized by the voters of the District in 2004 to pay for the FasTracks rapid transit improvement program. Based
on estimated fiscal year spending for 2018, $24,079 of year-end net position has been reserved for emergencies. The
Amendment is complex and subject to judicial interpretation. RTD believes it is in compliance with the requirements of the
Amendment based on the interpretations of the Amendment’s language available at year-end.
NOTE L – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
On April 26, 2019, the FastTracks Gold Line opened for revenue service. Opening this 11.2 mile commuter rail line marks the
final major milestone of the Eagle P3 project resulting in the design and build portion of this public private partnership being
considered substantially complete.

See accompanying independent auditors' opinion.

* Fiscal year 2015 was the 1st year of implementation, therefore only three years are shown.

Assumption changes for the Fiscal Year Ending December 31, 2018 (December 31, 2017 measurement date, January 1, 2017 acuarial valuaiton date): No changes in actuarial assumptions
were mde since the prior valuation.

Assumption changes for the Fiscal Year Ending December 31, 2017 (December 31, 2016 measurement date, January 1, 2016 actuarial valuation date): the administrative expense assumption
was updated from $165,000 per year, payable monthly, to $150,000 per year, payable monthly. The updated administrative expense assumption is expected to be more reflective of future
administrative expenses for the Plan. The administrative expense assumption is used for determining the actuarially determined contribution and does not impact Total Pension Liability.

Assumption changes for the Fiscal Year Ending December 31, 2016 (December 31, 2015 measurement date, January 1, 2015 actuarial valuation date): the amount reported as Assumption
Changes resulted from a change in the salary increase assumption (average weighted salary increase changed from 4.00% to 5.00%). This change is expected to be more reflective of future
plan experience.

Subject:

Approval of the Denver
Contract for LiVE Program

Board Meeting Date:

Human

Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to execute a
contract to validate income and provide customer service to help manage LiVE Program eligibility
applications through the State PEAK software system for an amount not to exceed $2,000,000. The
contract is for five (5) years of application processing and customer service.
GENERAL MANAGER’S GOALS
Core Goal #3: Strong Financial Management
Task Goal #3: Ensure Fiscal Sustainability
BACKGROUND
RTD commits to reviewing its Fare Structure and Fare Programs every three years to determine if any
additions or changes are required to provide the best options for RTD ridership and meet RTD’s revenue
targets. As part of this process, the RTD Board of Directors approved a new Low-Income Fare Program
(now branded LiVE Program) in mid-September 2018.
RTD is working with the Colorado Governor’s Office of Information Technology (OIT) to implement a
program for evaluating RTD riders’ eligibility for the LiVE program using the State’s public benefits
application system, PEAK.
For applicants who are not categorically income-eligible for the LiVE card through current enrollment in a
qualifying public assistance program, their application will be subject to income validation. Denver
Human Services (DHS) has agreed to assist RTD with this income validation process.
DISCUSSION
RTD needs to execute a contract with DHS to implement income validation and customer service for the
LiVE Program. The contract includes the following items:
 DHS shall conduct the LiVE income validation process for applicants who are not categorically
income-eligible through certain public assistance programs
 DHS shall provide customer service through their call center to applicants for the LiVE program
 DHS shall provide data confidentiality, privacy and security management
 DHS shall participate in audits requested by RTD, not more than annually
 DHS shall provide reporting on the applications processed
The services shall be performed by DHS for a fee. Members of DHS have generously donated their time
to provide guidance to support implementation of RTD’s LiVE Program.

Packet Pg. 139

1.B.2

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The contract authority shall not exceed $2,000,000. Funding for this project is included in the 2019
Budget. These funds will support up to 4-6 FTE for up to 5 years.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to
execute a contract to validate income and provide customer service to help manage LiVE Program
eligibility applications through the State PEAK software system for an amount not to exceed
$2,000,000. The contract is for five (5) years of application processing and customer service.
2. RTD can independently, or through a contractor, develop capacity and procedures to evaluate
income of applicants and provide customer support for LiVE program applicants. RTD does not
have the resources to provide such services. Development of such capacity would take more than
a year to implement.. Building such a department at RTD would be significantly more expensive
because RTD does not have the advantages of existing expertise, procedures and structures,
economies of scale, and capacity to cover fluctuations in application volume. This would put
implementation of the LiVE Program at significant risk.

Contract Award for the Transportation
Transformation Comprehensive Plan

CFO/AGM,

GM
Board Meeting Date:

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager to approve a professional services contract award to Felsburg Holt &
Ullevig to serve as the contractor for assistance in the preparation of the Transportation Transformation
(T2) Comprehensive (Comp) Plan for an amount not to exceed $3,999,511. Funding for this contract is
included in the 2019 Adopted Budget for the T2 Comp Plan.
This action addresses four of the General Manager’s goals for 2019:





Task Goal #4 – Address Future Transportation Needs and Methods
Task Goal #3 – Ensure Fiscal Sustainability
Core Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services
Core Goal #3 - Strong Financial Management

BACKGROUND
Preparation of a systems optimization plan/comprehensive operations analysis is one important element
of the Board adopted 2019 Task Goal #4 (Address Future Transportation Needs and Methods.) The
Board-directed effort will be an integral component of RTD’s Transportation Transformation initiative, as
the District evolves as both a mobility integrator and public transit provider. The Transportation
Transformation Comprehensive Plan (T2 Comp Plan) is anticipated to provide guidance on future RTD
services, to complement FasTracks, and to chart a course that optimizes existing and future FasTracks
infrastructure and determines what other future investments are needed. The plan is intended to provide
a vision for RTD’s existing rail system, focus on ancillary services such as multi-modal first/last mile
connections, maximize FasTracks investments, address staffing-related challenges, evaluate long-term
parking needs, determine the location and nature of future bus and rail maintenance facilities, consider
fleet electrification, and review RTD’s boundaries. The effort also will include a re-examination of RTD’s
financial planning processes to determine how RTD can enhance them to meet the changing service and
infrastructure needs of the District in a fiscally sustainable manner.
In February 2019, the Board approved a transfer to appropriate all the programmed funds in 2019 for a
total budget of $4,317,000, which includes the $1,420,000 for the T2 Comp Plan that RTD received
through a federal grant competitively awarded by DRCOG. The grant funds will be available to RTD in
October 2019.
DISCUSSION
RTD issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) in March 2019 for consultant services to assist with the
preparation of the T2 Comp Plan. The RFP included an 18 percent Disadvantaged Business Enterprise
(DBE) goal. A committee comprised of representatives from RTD and DRCOG staffs reviewed proposals
submitted by consultant teams in a qualifications-based selection process. The evaluation considered
each team’s technical proposal in the following areas:

Fiscal/Financial Stability Plan;
Engagement/Communications/Outreach;
Comprehensive Assessment of RTD Services-System Optimization Plan;
Mobility Plan for the Future;
Qualifications of the Firm (Similar Projects); and
Qualifications of the Project Manager with Similar Projects.

Cost and Person Hours were also evaluated, following the completion of technical scoring.
RTD received two submittals in response to the RFP: Felsburg Holt & Ullevig and HDR Engineering.
The committee found that the Felsburg Holt & Ullevig team had the most thorough understanding of the
work, including innovative approaches to the overall work effort and an extensive understanding of key
District opportunities and challenges. Notable aspects of the Felsburg Holt & Ullevig approach include
the following:








Recognition of the Board’s role in defining key policy guidance to lead the plan, as well as the
Board’s direct engagement and involvement during Plan preparation;
Commitment to the District’s schedule, which calls for submittal of the System Optimization Plan
component approximately 12 months after notice to proceed;
A holistic approach to weaving together the distinct, yet interconnected Plan components;
Strong local project management supplemented by recognized national experts;
A non-proprietary financial planning approach that builds upon existing District models and
practices;
Exceeding the 18 percent DBE goal with 22 percent DBE participation; and
Creative and extensive strategies to incorporate Board, customer, stakeholder, and staff input to
inform and guide the Plan.

Staff is requesting that the Board approve this recommendation and authorize the General Manager to
negotiate a contract not to exceed $3,999,511. Upon successful negotiations, the Plan effort will begin
immediately and is expected to be complete within 24 months from notice-to-proceed. The System
Optimization Plan component, which would include potential recommendations for bus and rail changes,
would be completed within approximately 12 months. As noted above, the RFP established an 18
percent DBE goal, and Felsburg Holt & Ullevig has committed to exceeding this with a DBE commitment
of 22 percent.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for this contract is included in the 2019 Adopted Budget for the T2 Comp Plan.
ALTERNATIVES
 Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit
Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to approve a
professional services contract award to Felsburg Holt & Ullevig to serve as the Contractor for
assistance in the preparation of the T2 Comp Plan for an amount not to exceed $3,999,511.
Funding for this contract is included in the 2019 Adopted Budget for the T2 Comp Plan.


Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to approve a
professional services contract award to Felsburg Holt & Ullevig to serve as the Contractor for
assistance in the preparation of the T2 Comp Plan for an amount not to exceed $3,999,511. This
action is not recommended since it will delay the procurement of consultant services for the T2
Comp Plan, and will jeopardize the $1.42 million in DRCOG TIP grant funding for the project.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

Date: May 2, 2019

From:

Doug Tisdale, Director, District H

GM

Date:

May 2, 2019

Board Meeting Date:

Subject:

Revised Governance Manual

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Chair of the Board of Directors and the Executive Committee that the Board of
Directors approve the revised RTD Board of Directors Governance Manual (Governance Manual), as
presented to the Finance, Administration, & Audit Committee.
The Chair further recommends that, should additional changes be made going forward to any of the
documents contained as appendices to the Governance Manual, which changes would necessitate nonsubstantive administrative or ministerial changes to the Manual itself, Board Office staff be permitted to
incorporate those corresponding changes to the Governance Manual without the need for further Board
approval.
This recommendation is consistent with the General Manager’s 2019 Core Goal #2 – Strong & Ethical
Leadership.
BACKGROUND
The Governance Manual is a Board-approved document that was created in response to a
recommendation contained in a 2010 state performance audit. The audit recommendation was to
develop such a document in order “to facilitate the organized, efficient, and cohesive functioning of the
Board in fulfilling its responsibilities”. The audit further recommended that the Board review and update
its Governance Manual annually. The Governance Manual itself was last reviewed and approved by the
Board in August 2012, though several changes to the manual’s appendices were approved by the Board
in early 2019.
DISCUSSION
The proposed revisions to the Governance Manual are an effort to:
 Employ a uniform system of punctuation, capitalization, and wording;
 Eliminate obsolete, inaccurate, or redundant references;
 Correct obvious errors and inconsistencies;
 Clarify existing policy and modernize terminology.
In adopting this recommended action, the Board acknowledges its intent that subsequent changes to the
any of the Governance Manual’s appendices need not necessitate a corresponding Board-driven
recommended action to change the Governance Manual itself, so long as the changes to the Governance
Manual are merely administrative or ministerial in nature.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with the adoption of the revised Governance Manual.

Packet Pg. 144

ALTERNATIVES
1. To adopt the proposed revisions to the Governance Manual.
2. To reject by way of amendment some of the proposed revisions.
3. To reject all revisions. This is not the preferred alternative.

district. Members of the Board of Ddirectors are elected to represent the people in the district based on
population size as determined by the US Census. Following the federal census, the bBoard of dDirectors
shall apportion the composition of the boardBoard into compact and contiguous director districts so
that, to the extent practical, each district size will represent equal population.
The RTD Board is subject to several major laws and policies that defines define and affects affect its
power and authority to act:
1) The Regional Transportation District Act (RTD Act)—provides the statutory enabling legislation by
with which the RTD Board of Directors and the agency must comply. Key components of this act
include:








1.3 Organization and Composition of RTD Board
Elected Official Board
The RTD Board of Directors is an elected Board with each district representing a constituency base of
approximately 180,000 based on the 2010 census. The In the second year following each census, a
redistricting process occurs to apportion the composition of the Board into compact and contiguous
Director districts so that the fifteen directors will represent to the extent practical the people of the
district on the basis of population. If the apportionment is not complete before March 15 of the second
year following the census, the lLegislative cCouncil created in C.R.S. 2-3-301, with the assistance of the
Director of Research of the Legislative Council and the Director of the Office of Legislative Legal Services
created in C.R.S. 2-3-501, shall apportion the composition of the Board district.
Board Member Composition
The Board is comprised of 15 non-partisan, publicly elected Board members representing the 15 districts
of the RTD district. While it is desirable that Board members are diverse, knowledgeable and supportive
of public transit, anyone can run for office as long as he/she is a qualified elector of the Director District
from which he/she intends to run; is at least 18 years of age and a citizen of the United States, and a
resident of the Director District in which he/she is running for at least 32 days prior to filing a petition to
run with the Secretary of State. Board members are elected in the general election and any candidate
who qualifies through the petition process will be on the general election ballot.

Board members are elected for a term of four years and can serve for a maximum of 2two terms. Terms
are generally staggered so that not all Board members are up for election/re-election at the same time.
If a Board member terminates before his term is over, section 32-9-112 of the RTD Act defines the
process for filling or appointing someone else to complete the term of that Board member. Board
members who have been appointed to fill a vacancy will serve until the next regular election, at which
time the vacancy shall be filled by election for any remaining unexpired portion of the term.
1.4 Structure and Practice of RTD Board
Difference between Governance and Management Board
The question of whether the RTD Board is a governance Bboard or a management Bboard often comes
up in the discussion of duties and functions of the RTD Board. While it is clear that, as part of the
legislative enabling act, the RTD Board was created as a policy- making Bboard (i.e. governance) to
represent the public interest, boundaries for the execution of the functions and powers afforded to the
Board in the RTD Act are complex and affect management as well. Generally, the creation of policy and
establishing strategic direction is a Board function whereas the implementation of policy is a staff
responsibility. However, areas where the Board may cross into management include financial approval
of contracts, fare structure, CEO/General Manager oversight and management. As an elected Board,
often times political implications of a decision must be considered as well. The distinction between
policy and management is often distorted when boardBoard governance is characterized by a merging
of management, political and policy-making functions. Board members must avoid the proclivity of
getting too detailed in day to day operations and try to stay focused at the policy making level.
Committee Structure and Focus
Newly elected Directors or re-elected Directors are sworn into office at the first regular or special
boardBoard meeting of the year. Each member of the boardBoard, before assuming the responsibilities
of his or her office, shall take and subscribe an oath of office administered by such person or persons
designated by the Board. Following the swearing in of new Board members, the full Board will vote on
officers for the year who comprise the Executive Committee. Officers are: Chair of the Board, ViceChair or Chair Pro Tem, 2nd Vice-Chair, Secretary and Treasurer. The Chair then appoints the Cchair and
Vvice-Cchair of the standing and ad hoc committees.
The Board Bylaws currently provide the description of these standing committees for 201912:




Executive Committee
General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee
Planning/Capital Programs and FasTracks Committee



Planning and Development Committee





Finance and Administration and Audit Committee
Operations/Customer Service Committee

Small Business Enterprise/Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (SBE/DBE)

With the exception of the Executive Committee and the General Manager Oversight and Performance
Management Committee, all standing committees are committees of the whole with a quorum of five
members. The Committee of the whole structure was approved by the Board in an attempt to provide a
time and opportunity for the full Board members to participate in committee discussions, acquire
knowledge at the same time, and to have a voice to represent their particular constituency base. This
has had the net effect of moving the voting items for unanimous consent and recommended action on
the Board agenda more expeditiously and effectively. Committee Charters are prepared and Board
approved for each of the standing committees.
Ad Hoc Committee
Ad hoc committees are committees that can be assigned by the Chair based upon a particular need or
issue. All such special or ad hoc committees shall be evaluated annually by the current Chair of the
Board for update, change of committee members, or dissolution, as appropriate. These committees are
generally short term and expire upon the termination of the Chair of the Board.
For information on committee charters, please refer to Part V, Committee Charter section of this
manual.

Educating and bringing Board members up to speed on items of consideration that they need to
perform effectively in their role is one of the responsibilities of the General Manager and his staff. In
addition to committee meetings, boardBoard documents and one-on ones with respective Board
members, Board members are highly encouraged to read the material and familiarize themselves with
the current program status. Study sessions are held periodicallymonthly to introduce new items and
provide information to the Board members.
Board members are also encouraged to become active in the American Public Transportation
Association (APTA), which is the premier association of over 1500-member organizations-bus,
paratransit, rail systems-providing public transportation options. One of the central functions that APTA
offers are is a number of workshops, seminars, conferences and resources throughout the year that

1.B.4.b

This manual documents the RTD Board of Directors’ role of governance as the policy-maker for the RTD
District. The Colorado General Assembly created the RTD district in 1969 by legislative act. Pursuant to
section 32-9-109.5 of the RTD Act, a full copy of which is contained in this manual, effective January 1,
1993, the governing body of the district shall be a Board of Directors consisting of fifteen persons, each
of whom is an eligible elector residing within the director district. Members of the Board of Directors are
elected to represent the people in the district based on population size as determined by the US Census.
Following the federal census, the Board of Directors shall apportion the composition of the Board into
compact and contiguous director districts so that, to the extent practical, each district size will represent
equal population.
The RTD Board is subject to several major laws and policies that define and affect its power and
authority to act:
1) The Regional Transportation District Act (RTD Act)—provides the statutory enabling legislation with
which the RTD Board of Directors and the agency must comply. Key components of this act include:








RTD is authorized to operate a mass transit system (C.R.S. 32-9-102)
RTD can act through eight votes of its Board of Directors (C.R.S.32-9-116 (3))
RTD is a political subdivision of the state (C.R.S. 32-9-119). It is created by the legislature and
changes in the RTD Act require a vote of the legislature
RTD has the power of a corporation—contracting, buying and selling property, and hiring of
employees
RTD collects a 1% sales and use tax (C.R.S. 32-9-119 (2))
RTD tax is administered by the Department of Revenue
RTD may privatize up to 58%of its non-rail service (C.R.S. 32-9-119.5)

2) The RTD Board of Directors Bylaws—the authority to adopt Bylaws is expressly conferred by Section
114, Paragraph 1 (b) of the RTD Act. Some rules governing the internal affairs of the Board of Directors
are contained in the Act, while others, by delegation, are established by the Board. The RTD Bylaws
combine those rules contained in the Act with those adopted by the Board, Resolution 3 of Series 2019
Should any conflict or contradictory language exist, the RTD Act prevails.
3) Colorado Public Official Disclosure Law—as elected officials, RTD Directors must provide a disclosure
to the Secretary of State within 30 days after election or re-election. Such information includes business
and real estate interests, statement of gifts and honoraria and names and sources of income.
4) Colorado Open Meetings and Open Records Act (C.R.S. 24-6-401 & 24-72-201)—some of the
provisions related to these laws include:

Through the responsibilities and authority delegated by the Board of Directors, the General
Manager and the Senior Leadership Team implement and manage the agency in accordance
with the direction that has been set by the Board.
All action via resolution and Board orders that are voted on by the Board in a full Board meeting
become the official record of the District.
The Board has committed to transparency in its overall governance of the District.
The Board is an elected Board that represents the interest of its constituency while focusing on
its collective mission to offer safe, clean, reliable, courteous, accessible and cost-effective
service throughout the District.
Resolution number 1 of series 2019 provides the RTD Board Operating Guidelines to govern its

goal setting and establish other strategic priorities for the District.
The Governance Manual is a working document that will be reviewed annually for appropriate
and necessary changes in accordance with the RTD Act, Bylaws, and Board policies and
procedures.

1.3 Organization and Composition of RTD Board
Elected Official Board
The RTD Board of Directors is an elected Board with each district representing a constituency base of
approximately 180,000 based on the 2010 census. In the second year following each census, a
redistricting process occurs to apportion the composition of the Board into compact and contiguous
Director districts so that the fifteen directors will represent to the extent practical the people of the
district on the basis of population. If the apportionment is not complete before March 15 of the second
year following the census, the Legislative Council created in C.R.S. 2-3-301, with the assistance of the
Director of Research of the Legislative Council and the Director of the Office of Legislative Legal Services
created in C.R.S. 2-3-501, shall apportion the composition of the Board district.
Board Member Composition
The Board is comprised of 15 non-partisan, publicly elected Board members representing the 15 districts
of the RTD district. While it is desirable that Board members are diverse, knowledgeable and supportive
of public transit, anyone can run for office as long as he/she is a qualified elector of the Director District
from which he/she intends to run; is at least 18 years of age and a citizen of the United States, and a
resident of the Director District in which he/she is running for at least 32 days prior to filing a petition to
run with the Secretary of State. Board members are elected in the general election and any candidate
who qualifies through the petition process will be on the general election ballot.

Educating and bringing Board members up to speed on items of consideration that they need to
perform effectively in their role is one of the responsibilities of the General Manager and his staff. In
addition to committee meetings, Board documents and one-on ones with respective Board members,
Board members are highly encouraged to read the material and familiarize themselves with the current
program status. Study sessions are held periodically to introduce new items and provide information to
the Board members.
Board members are also encouraged to become active in the American Public Transportation
Association (APTA), which is the premier association of over 1500-member organizations-bus,
paratransit, rail systems-providing public transportation options. One of the central functions that APTA
offers is a number of workshops, seminars, conferences and resources throughout the year that
contribute to public transportation knowledge, development and growth. APTA also serves as a national
advocate for public transportation. Board Members are provided two free registrations annually to any
of these conferences identified and are encouraged to participate.
An Annual Board Retreat held during the first quarter of the year is a powerful development tool for the
Board to use with the senior leadership team to set vision, develop strategy and goals that are
integrated into the annual operations/ budget planning cycle.

1.C.1.c

Packet Pg. 179

1.C.1.c

The purpose of RTD’s Internal and Information Systems Audit Function is to provide
independent, objective assurance and consulting services designed to add value and
improve RTD’s processes. The mission of Internal and Information Systems Audit is to
enhance and protect organizational value by providing risk-based and objective
assurance, advice, and insight. The Internal and Information Systems Audit Function helps
RTD accomplish its objectives by bringing a systematic, disciplined approach to evaluate
and improve the effectiveness of governance, risk management, and control processes.
(Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing).
The Internal and Information Systems Audit Function will govern itself by adherence to the
mandatory elements of The Institute of Internal Auditors' International Professional
Practices Framework, including the Core Principles for the Professional Practice of
Internal Auditing, the Code of Ethics, the International Standards for the Professional
Practice of Internal Auditing, and the Definition of Internal Auditing. The Manager of
Internal and IT Audit will report periodically to Senior Management and the Board
regarding the function’s conformance to the Code of Ethics and the Standards.

Authority
The Manager of Internal and IT Audit will report functionally to the Board and
administratively (i.e., day-to-day operations) to the General Manager and CEO.
To establish, maintain, and assure that RTD’s Internal and Information Systems Audit
Function has sufficient authority to fulfill its duties, the Board will:

•
•
•
•

Approve the function’s charter.
Approve the risk-based Annual Audit Plan.
Receive communications from the Manager of Internal and IT Audit on the
function’s performance relative to its plan and other matters.
Make appropriate inquiries of management and the Manager of Internal and IT
Audit to determine whether there is inappropriate scope or resource limitations.

Attachment: RTD Audit Charter Final Dec2018v1 (3818 : Audit Update)

Purpose and Mission

The Manager of Internal and IT Audit will have unrestricted access to, and communicate
and interact directly with, the Board.
The Board and the General Manager and CEO authorize the Internal and Information
Systems Audit Function to:

•
•

Allocate resources, set frequencies, select subjects, determine scopes of work,
apply techniques required to accomplish audit objectives, and issue reports.
Obtain assistance from the necessary personnel of RTD, as well as other
specialized services from within or outside RTD, in order to complete the
engagement.

The Manager of Internal and IT Audit will ensure that the Internal and Information Systems
Audit Function remains free from all conditions that threaten the ability of all auditors to
carry out their responsibilities in an unbiased manner, including matters of audit selection,
scope, procedures, frequency, timing, and report content. If the Manager of Internal and
IT Audit determines that independence or objectivity may be impaired in fact or
appearance, the details of impairment will be disclosed to appropriate parties.
All auditors will maintain an unbiased mental attitude that allows them to perform
engagements objectively and in such a manner that they believe in their work product,
that no quality compromises are made, and that they do not subordinate their judgment
on audit matters to others.
Auditors will have no direct operational responsibility or authority over any of the activities
audited. Accordingly, auditors will not implement internal controls, develop procedures,
install systems, prepare records, or engage in any other activity that may impair their
judgment, including:

•

Assessing specific operations for which they had responsibility within the previous
year.
• Performing any operational duties for RTD or its affiliates.
• Initiating or approving transactions external to the Internal and Information
Systems Audit Function
• Directing the activities of any RTD employee not employed by the Internal and
Information Systems Audit Function except to the extent that such employees have
been appropriately assigned to auditing teams or to otherwise assist internal
auditors.
Where the Manager of Internal and IT Audit has or is expected to have roles and/or
responsibilities that fall outside of auditing, safeguards will be established to limit
impairments to independence or objectivity.

organizational independence of the Internal and Information Systems Audit Function.
The Manager of Internal and IT Audit will disclose to the Board any interference and
related implications in determining the scope of auditing, performing work, and/or
communicating results.

limited to, objective examinations of evidence for the purpose of providing independent
assessments to the Board, management, and outside parties on the adequacy and
effectiveness of governance, risk management, and control processes for RTD. Internal

• Applications included streaming movies and television programs that
are stored on a server on the vehicle rather than the Internet
• Airlines now have their own dedicated ground-based network that
planes connect to – much faster than cellular networks
• Recent advances in technology provide satellite-based Internet
connection with limited capacity – streaming from the Internet is
heavily restricted

– pay more for more capacity

• Buses, trains, airplanes, and

Who’s On Board? Report – 2016
What People Value in Transit
• The two most important factors driving satisfaction with
transit are service frequency and travel time.
• Riders also value station and stop conditions, real-time
information, and service reliability.
• Transit riders say the least important improvements are
power outlets and Wi-Fi (out of a list of a dozen potential
service improvements). Our findings call into question
the fad among transit agencies touting free Wi-Fi for
customers who don’t care strongly for it.

• Although the passenger’s Wi-Fi connection to the Wireless Access
Point on the bus/train is very good, there is little capacity to get from
the router to the carrier networks
• All those passengers share the same, single LTE connection to carrier
networks
• Connection varies with coverage in area
• Typical 4G LTE bandwidth over cellular is 4-12 Mbps (carriers claim
30-50 Mbps)
• Typical capacity requirement for casual Internet use on public Wi-Fi
(web browser, email, Social Media) is 1.2 Mbps per 10 users

Data Risks to RTD and Wi-Fi Users
• Public Wi-Fi cannot share RTD’s onboard infrastructure or network
• Separate network required for security – duplicating cellular costs

• Collected data privacy issues
• What data is legal to own? Can data be used internally? Can data be sold?
Legal review required.

• 3rd Party Wi-Fi Provider – now who owns the data?
• Wi-Fi users are subject to hackers, malware, and identity theft
• Ridership uses at own risk, but risks are high
• Hackers create networks with similar names
• Hardware and software needs periodic patching and updates for security risks - 3rd party
Wi-Fi network providers are responsible – but are they doing it?

Installation Issues
• RTD Installed a new Computer Aided Dispatch system on all fixed
route vehicles in 2011 and 2012
• Installation design, prototyping and planning including all sub-fleet types – 6
Months
• Equipment order, manufacture, and delivery – 5 Months
• Testing – 3 Months
• Fleet Installations – 18 Months
• RTD resources for planning, design, installation (coordination, oversight,
vehicle inspection) – over 3,600 hours

3rd Party Wi-Fi Vendor Application
• Almost all Installation issues and timelines in CAD/AVL comparison still exist
in 3rd Party installation process – Cost could be dramatically different
• RTD will still need additional people resources to run the project
• RTD will still receive calls to Customer Care, questions to Operators, Social
Media posts, etc. Complaints/comments will be routed to 3rd party vendor.
• Onboard equipment needs to be secured in an alternate location from the
rest of the vehicle’s communications/CAD/AVL equipment
• Onboard component maintenance needs to be coordinated with as many as
14 different Divisions/Contractors – Fixed Route, Light Rail, Commuter Rail,
Access-a-Ride, Flex Ride
• Data ownership issues, reporting costs

Board Meeting Date: April 9, 2019
Information

BACKGROUND
When the Board passed the new fare structure and pricing in September 2018, they requested that staff
continue to work with stakeholders on implementation issues particularly in the area of the CollegePass
program. Based on the Board’s direction, RTD staff has had many meetings with stakeholders over the
last 6 months and have looked into the many requests that we received. For example: Could we allow
CollegePass and EcoPass holders at the age of 19 and under to be priced at the 70% Youth discount?
Would we be open to having the tap data that is used for pricing to be audited? Would we be willing to
phase the price increases for CollegePass over 5 years instead of 3 years?
Staff has researched various options and has agreed to have the tap data audited by our financial
auditing firm on a three (3) year basis. In addition, we looked at the option of applying the youth
discount to the CollegePass program and phasing the price increases for the CollegePass over 5 years
instead of 3 years. Although we will not be pursuing the youth discount for CollegePass at this time,
there is merit in looking at expanding the phase-in period for CollegePass. The results are below. We
looked at applying the 5 year phase-in period to the CollegePass, Neighborhood EcoPass, and EcoPass as
these pass programs have similar program attributes and financial impacts to the customer and RTD.
DISCUSSION
Staff has spent the last several months working with our consultants to model the impacts of spreading
the implementation of the EcoPass, Neighborhood EcoPass, and CollegePass pricing changes over 5
years instead of 3 years. Currently the increase for EcoPass, Neighborhood EcoPass, and CollegePass
increases are capped at 20% in years 2019 and 2020 with the entire increase implemented in year
2021. This was a proposal from the Pass Working Group and was adopted by the Board.
The new proposal would move the phasing of the price increase from a 3 year phase-in period to a 5
year phase-in period. This would extend the 20% cap on price increases to not only year 2019 and
2020 but also years 2021 and 2022 with the full implementation of the fare increase in 2023.

The Modeling Assumptions Were as Follows:
 The revenue & ridership impact of extending the phasing are based on the model assumptions,
namely the degree of retention of organizations given price increases
 Modeling assumptions regarding retention were used to provide conservative revenue estimates
for price increases for pass program organizations
 Modeling assumed that all Colleges, Large Employers, and Master EcoPass contracts would
remain in RTD’s pass programs in both phasing scenarios.
Beneficiaries of Longer Phasing:

EcoPass
SLA A Employers (1-24 Employees)
SLA A Employers (25-249 Employees)
SLA D – DIA Employers
Auraria Staff
CU Boulder Staff
CAGID

To a lesser degree Naropa & Escoffier

Total # of Employees/Employers in SLA
~125-130 Employers & ~1,500 Employees
~135-140 Employers & ~11,000 Employees
~40 Employers & ~5,300 Employees
~3,900 Staff
~9,700 Staff
~7,300 Staff

~20-25 of the 55 Neighborhoods

Title VI Impacts:
 Phasing over 5 vs 3 years would not be considered a fare change
 To understand how the phasing would impact the overall average fare increase of riders in 2021,
a comparison of the increase in average fare for minority and low-income riders were compared to
all riders
 The percentage point change in the average fare between protected riders and all riders is within
RTD’s +/- 5% threshold under either phasing timeframe
Financial Impacts:
 Extending phasing would result in identical ridership but a loss in revenue in 2021 and 2022
 Estimated Revenue Loss
 2021 - $1.5 million to $2.5 million
 2022 - $1.5 million to $2.0 million
 2023 - $0 to $500,000
 Total 2021-2023 is between $3 million and $5 million
Advantages of Longer Phasing:
 Extending the phasing from 3 to 5 years improves model results of retention for organizations
that will experience significant increases due to historic underpricing
 Continued participation encourages transit ridership and diversion of auto trips
 Retention of participating organizations helps maintain current revenue streams
Challenges of Longer Phasing:
 Organizations may respond differently than predicted by the model
 Phasing increases over 5 years instead of 3 may result in different ridership and revenue retention
results

Board Meeting Date: May 7, 2019
Information

BACKGROUND
RTD commits to reviewing its Fare Structure and Fare Programs every three years to determine if any
additions or changes are required to provide the best options for RTD ridership and meet RTD’s revenue
targets. Over 20 months ending in mid-2018, the Pass Working Group and RTD staff reviewed all fares
and fare programs to define potential fare changes and improvements. RTD staff presented a
recommendation to the RTD Board of Directors and received approval mid-September 2018. The goal of
this project is to implement changes to the RTD Fares, Fare Structure, and changes and additions to the
Fare Programs as approved by the RTD Board of Directors.
DISCUSSION
The January 2019 fare changes were implemented as scheduled and we are now focusing on the low
income fare program (now branded LiVE Program) development.
RTD is working with the State’s Office of Information Technology (OIT) to implement a program for
evaluating RTD riders’ eligibility for the LiVE Program using the State’s public benefits application
system, PEAK. RTD staff has been meeting with employees from various departments and OIT for
several months.
The following has been completed:







The Business Requirements Document (BRD) with OIT has been finalized. The BRD provides the
requirements necessary for OIT to develop the RTD application within the PEAK system.
The MyRide LiVE card design and final proofs have gone to the smart card vendor for production.
The technical design document for the development of the LiVE Program application in PEAK has
been completed.
The Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) between RTD and OIT has been finalized and signed by
both parties.
Several meetings have been held with Denver Human Services (DHS), which will provide income
validation services and customer service functions related to LiVE Program applications.
A request for quotes for a vendor to produce and mail LiVE ID cards has been prepared and will
be issued soon.

Next Steps:
 Finalize the contract between DHS and RTD for LiVE Program income validation and customer
service functions related to applications.
 Issue the contract for the production of LiVE ID cards.
 Continue evaluating options to provide customer service to LiVE participants regarding the
program and LiVE ID cards.



Place the order for LiVE 10-ride ticket books which will be available to organizations in the
Nonprofit Program.
Continue developing an integrated marketing, communication and outreach plan for the
implementation of the LiVE Program and the related changes to the Nonprofit Program.
Plan for the programming changes in the fare collection systems.
Develop informational materials.

2019 Approved Changes Summary:
 Cash Fare: $3 Local / $5.25 Regional / $10.50 Airport.
 3-Hour Pass: These fares allow riders to travel for three hours in any direction. This change
replaces the three-hour one-way transfer or ticket.
 Retain ticket book and MyRide discount with modifications (Riders purchasing a 10-ride ticket
book or paying with a MyRide smart card will receive a discount)
 The youth discount will increase from 50 percent to 70 percent and will be solely age-based
(ages 6-19).
 Utilization pricing for pass programs: Pricing for EcoPass, Neighborhood EcoPass, and CollegePass
will now be priced based upon trips taken.
 EcoPass: Other updates to pricing based on changes in service levels and employer categories.
 FlexPass: Discontinue program discount. Employers and employees pay regular monthly pass
price.
 New Low-Income Program (Targeting Summer 2019)

POLICY REFERENCE
Investment Policy
DISCUSSION
Please find the District’s investment report for the first quarter of 2019 attached.
The U.S. economy and household spending continued to expand at a slower pace during the first quarter
of 2019. The U.S. unemployment rate remained low and general inflationary pressures remained tame.
In view the combination of strong labor market conditions and slowing economic activity from the fourth
quarter, the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal
funds rate to 2.25 to 2.5 percent in January. The Committee stated that it “will be patient as it
determines what future adjustments to the target range may be appropriate”.
The District’s Investment Policy (the “Policy”) is conservative in nature and seeks to satisfy the three
primary objectives of: safety, liquidity and yield, in that order of importance. The Policy specifies that:
“Quarterly reports shall outline the District’s total investment return and compare the portfolio’s
performance to a publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics
to the portfolio or sub-portfolio being measured. For the liquidity tier of the portfolio (cash and cash
equivalents), the specified index shall be the 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index as published by Bank of
America Merrill Lynch for the period being measured. For the enhanced cash portion of the portfolio
(securities maturing between 90 days and 5 years and with a target duration of 1 year), the designated
performance benchmark will be the Merrill Lynch 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.”
The total return (yield plus change in market value) on the liquidity and enhanced cash tiers of the
District’s unrestricted portfolio and investment benchmarks were as follows:
