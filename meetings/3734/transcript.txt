CHAIR ERIK DAVIDSON: And this is Chair Davidson speaking. I am present. That is 10 present, 5
absent. We have a quorum. Please note that the Special Board Meeting does not have a section for
public comment this afternoon. However, if anyone would like to address the Board, they can do so

during our regularly scheduled board meeting, which will come after this to commence at 5:30 PM
Mountain Daylight Time. Our goal is to have that meeting start on time, and the public will have the ability
to offer comments to the Board of Directors at that time.
Now move to the next and only section of our agenda here, an executive session. In a moment, the Board
will meet in executive session regarding the January 24, 2024, E Line incident, north of Southmoor
Station. I would like to append the motion to move into executive session to state that the Special Board
Meeting will be deemed adjourned after it adjourns into the executive session.
For public transparency, this means that once the Board moves into executive session, the main meeting
will be adjourned. For anyone who might be in the room or remote, the regularly scheduled May board
meeting will occur after this board meeting with the anticipated start time of 5:30 PM. So please know that
we will be back.
I will, in a moment, entertain a motion to move into executive session to discuss the following. Pursuant to
Section 24-6-4024 BCRs to receive legal advice, and Section 24-6-4024 for CCRS matters required to be
kept confidential by state law and rules. Section 40-18104 CRS and 7 CCR 723-7 Public Utilities
Commission Rules, 7349 DI and for confidentiality of light rail vehicle accident investigations regarding
the January 24, 2024, E Line incident, north of Southmoor Station. Do I have a motion?
DIRECTOR BOB BROOM: So moved.
DIRECTOR VINCE BUZEK: Second.
CHAIR ERIC DAVIDSON: I have Broom as the movent. The second as Buzek. Are there any no votes?
Seeing none. That will be 10 yes votes with 5 absent. The motion passes. Just give us one moment. We
will go ahead and set up for executive session, and reconvene once all of those who are entitled to
participate are in the room, and those who are not have left. Please give us a moment.
