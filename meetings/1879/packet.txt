Subject:

Contract Award for the District Shops HRU
Project.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to award a contract to the low, responsive, responsible
bidder, JCOR, in the not-to-exceed amount of $2,669,400 for the District Shops Heat Recovery Unit
(HRU) project. In addition, a transfer shall be made from the State of Good Repair federal grant to the
project budget in the amount of $322,103.
BACKGROUND
The scope of the District Shops HRU project is to replace 16 HRU’s that are beyond their useful life with
new units. The existing units were installed when the building was constructed in 1989. The 100%
outside air HRU’s provide gas heating, evaporative cooling, and energy recovery. The units exhaust
100% of the air supplied. The energy recovery section tempers incoming air to cool it in the summer and
warms it in the winter using energy absorbed from the exhaust air process.
DISCUSSION
The project was advertised on September 30, 2013. The pre-bid conference was held on October 15,
2013 and the bids were received on October 29, 2013 as follows:
1. JCOR - $2,669,400
2. Legacy - $2,733,500
DBE INVOLVEMENT
The DBE goal was advertised at 7% with JCOR meeting the goal.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for the project is included in the 2014 approved budget. With the transfer the construction
budget will be $2,669,400: $1,877,837.20 from federal grant CO-04-0043 with $469,459.80 of local
match and $257,682.40 from the State of Good Repair (SOGR) grant with $64,420.60 of local match.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services
Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager,or his designee, to award a
contract to the low, responsive, responsible bidder, JCOR, in the not-to-exceed amount of
$2,669,400 for the District Shops Heat Recovery Unit (HRU) project. In addition, a transfer shall be
made from the State of Good Repair federal grant to the project budget in the amount of $322,103.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager and/or his designee
to award a contract to the low, responsive, responsible bidder, JCOR, in the not-to-exceed amount of
$2,669,400 for the District Shops Heat Recovery Unit (HRU) project. Also, do not authorize a

Packet Pg. 7

2.B.1

transfer from the State of Good Repair federal grant to the project budget in the amount of
$322,103. Project shall be rebid. This is not recommended as the bids are considered competitive,
and delay may result in the loss of grant funds.
3. Do nothing. Cancel project and redirect funds. This is not recommended as the project has been fully
designed and the existing units are beyond their useful life and need replacement. Additionally, any
delay may result in the loss of grant funds.

Subject:

Transfer of Funds from Light Rail Capital to
Light Rail Expense

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to approve the transfer of $703,000 in approved 2014
capital to an expense line to facilitate the development of revised Light Rail Vehicle specifications.
BACKGROUND
The RTD Board of Directors approved the 2014 budget at the November 2013 meeting. One of the
capital projects approved at that meeting was funding to purchase Track Maintenance Equipment for the
Maintenance of Way Division of Rail Operations.
Since that time we have determined that in order to move forward with the purchase of new Light Rail
Vehicles scheduled for 2015 we need to develop a revised specification.
DISCUSSION
In order to develop a revised specification we need to get outside assistance from LTK, doing business
FRSC, as we have in the past. This will require a transfer of funds from capital to expense to fund the
work order on a contract that already exists.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
This transfer will not create a financial impact to the district since it is a transfer from capital to
expense. It will have a zero effect on the current approved budget.
DBE PARTICIPATION
The DBE requirements were satisfied when the current agreement with LTK (FRSC) was approved.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee, to approve this transfer in order to
develop a revised specification for Light Rail Vehicles to be ordered in 2015.
2. Do not authorize the transfer which will cause a delay in the purchase of Light Rail Vehicles
which have been scheduled for 2015.

Board Meeting Date: February 11, 2014

Subject:

Access-a-Ride Budget Transfer

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize a budget transfer in the amount of $5,271,915 to re-allocate previously approved Access-aRide 2014 funding from budget accounts associated with the expired Access-a-Ride service provider
contracts to budget accounts associated with the new Access-a-Ride service provider contracts.
BACKGROUND
The 2014 Access-a-Ride budget was prepared in mid-2013 and was based on the Access-a-Ride service
provider model that was in effect at that time. This model included four (4) dedicated-vehicle service
providers. In late-2013, the Access-a-Ride service provider contracts were re-bid and in November of
2013, the Board of Directors approved the award of the Access-a-Ride service provider contract to three
(3) dedicated-vehicle and one (1) non-dedicated-vehicle service providers. As a result, the 2014
approved budget funds for Access-a-Ride need to be re-allocated to the service providers chosen to
provide service in the new Access-a-Ride contract. The Board of Directors approved the 2014 budget at
the November 2013 meeting.
DISCUSSION
The total budget dollars being transferred, or re-allocated, is $5,271,915. This budget transfer will result
in some budget line items being reduced and others being increased, and the net effect on the 2014
budget is zero.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
This transfer will have no impact on the approved 2014 budget because it is simply a re-allocation of
previously approved funds.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Approve the budget transfer as recommended in order to proceed with the contract awards.
2. Do not approve the budget transfer. This course of action is not recommended as it will cause a
delay in the processing of the Access-a-Ride service provider contracts for 2014.

Subject:

Access-a-Cab Program

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorizes the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to extend
Agreements with Metro Taxi, Yellow Cab, and Union Taxi Inc., to provide Access-a-Cab services. In
addition, as long as the program remains successful and beneficial to RTD, the General Manager, or his
designee, is hereby authorized to negotiate and enter into agreements with each participating cab
company in subsequent years, hereafter.
BACKGROUND
In March of 1997, the RTD Board of Directors introduced the Access-a-Cab program to our Access-aRide program participants. The program offers flexibility in transportation services for individuals with
disabilities. Passengers are permitted to schedule same day trips with local taxi cab companies. Local
taxi companies currently participating include Yellow Transportation, Union Taxi, and Metro Taxi.
DISCUSSION
The subsidized Access-a-Cab program has proven to be very popular. Trips that are taken using the
Access-a-Cab service involve a lesser RTD subsidy per ride than trips taken on the regular Access-aRide service. All persons using Access-a-Cab are certified as eligible to use our Paratransit service,
Access-a-Ride. The budget for 2014 is as follows: Metro Taxi, $1,200,000, Yellow Cab, $800,000,
and Union Taxi Inc., $150,000. Funding for the Access-a-Cab is budgeted annually based on ridership
and anticipated demand.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for the Access-a-Cab service are included in the 2014 approved budget. Funds for Access-a-Cab
service in future years will be requested as part of future budget processes.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Approve the recommended continuance of Agreements for the Access-a-Cab program.
2. Do not approve the continuance of Agreements for the Access-a-Cab program. This is not
recommended as it will increase overall subsidy costs for our programs to serve individuals with
disabilities.

May 2014 Service Changes

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the May 2014 Service Change package as revised and summarized in Attachment A resulting in
an annualized cost increase of approximately $1,440,000 and, further, to authorize the General Manager
or his designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is
impacted by these changes.
DISCUSSION
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. We will continue adjusting services in
response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. With the
opening of the Union Station Bus Concourse a service plan has been developed; rerouting existing bus
service from the former Market Street Station to the new underground Bus Concourse facility at Denver
Union Station. Additionally, the Free MetroRide is a new service proposed for the downtown Denver
area. The Free Metro Ride would provide additional distribution/circulation service during peak periods to
supplement the existing Free Mall Ride service. Service changes not associated with or included in the
Denver Union Station Service Plan are also proposed to maintain system on-time performance and
provide the appropriate level of service according to customer demand. We will monitor customer
response to the implementation of Union Station Service Plan service and propose adjustments as
appropriate.
The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
 Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate impacts on low income and minority populations; and
 Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
SUMMARY OF PUBLIC HEARINGS
Two public hearings were held on January 29, 2014 where the primary subject was the opening of the
Denver Union Station Bus Concourse. Comments from these meetings and the service change website
are summarized in Attachment B of this report. It should be noted that three public hearings were held in
November 2013 to discuss the initial bus service plan for the opening of the DUS Bus Concourse.
CHANGES TO INITIAL RECOMMENDATIONS
Staff receives input during the public comment process and continues to conduct additional analysis
after the initial service recommendations are communicated to the Board of Directors. Depending on the

Packet Pg. 15

2.B.5

outcome of the public comment process and continued analysis, staff may or may not propose
modifications to these initial recommendations. The following represent substantive changes proposed to
the service changes initially communicated to the Board of Directors for implementation as part of the

2.B.5.a

The City and County of Denver has proposed to change one-way traffic to two-way traffic

currently experienced when the service frequency of the western segment is reduced from
peak levels. Additional schedule adjustment will also be made. No cost impacts are
anticipated.
Route 6 – East 6th Ave/North Pecos
Schedule adjustments to address on-time performance. No cost impacts are anticipated.
Route 8 – North Broadway/Huron: southbound buses will use West 45th Avenue from
Lincoln Street, replacing the one-block segment of West 46th Avenue. The new alignment
provides a better stop for passengers needing to use wheelchair lifts.

Place. Eastbound trips would start from West Howard Place to Decatur Street, West
Holden Place, Federal Boulevard, to the Colfax Viaduct, Auraria Parkway, and continue to
the existing route on Market Street. Please see attached map for further details. Costs are
estimated to be $530,000 annualized.
Route 16 Limited – West Colfax
Due to low ridership, it is proposed to discontinue alternate weekday trips between Civic
Center Station and Oak Street between 9:30 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. Half-hourly trips through

Cost savings estimated to be $133,000 annualized.
Route 20 – 20th Avenue
It is proposed to reroute trips that end at Federal Boulevard to instead end at the new bus
concourse at Union Station. Westbound service from 15th Street would continue via

2.B.5.b

This meeting was attended by 23 members of the public and RTD Board members Director Bill James
and Director Natalie Menten. RTD staff in attendance included: Robert Rynerson, Jeff Becker, Jessie
Carter, Doug Monroe, Chris Marko, and Diane Marquiss.
The comments from public largely centered on the proposal affecting the area around 18th Street
between Wazee and Wynkoop Streets accessing the DUS bus concourse. It was the view of those who
spoke that the routing was a burden unfairly placed on the residents in the area. The attendees
suggested alternative routings be studied to provide a more equitable distribution of the bus traffic
going into DUS. It was pointed out that pedestrian safety along with parking access were of great
concern.
Other comments were heard in favor of changes made to the Route 9 and comments made on behalf of
riders of late night/early light rail service.

various alternatives suggested.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: February 6, 2014

From:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

February 5, 2014

Board Meeting Date: February 11, 2014

Subject:

Service Performance 2012 Networked Family
of Services

Overview
RTD’s Mission is: "To meet our constituents' present and future public transit needs by offering safe,
clean, reliable, courteous, accessible and cost-effective service throughout the district." Service
development and performance analysis require that we ask several questions. What are the markets or
demand? Should service be provided and how much? What type of service should be provided? RTD’s
general approach is as follows. Develop a family of services suited to a variety of markets. Connect all
the services together in a network or system to accommodate today’s dispersed travel patterns. Match
the level-of-service with demand, thus improving performance and sustainability.
Performance is a term often used interchangeably with effectiveness and efficiency. The effectivenessproductivity charts in this report present these measures for all RTD services. Effectiveness measures
attainment of the objective-maximize ridership within the budget-and is presented on the y-axis as
subsidy per boarding. Efficiency-productivity or output/input-is presented on the x-axis as
boardings/vehicle hour. The charts offer a convenient, comparative analysis of all classes of services,
illustrating both absolute and relative performance.
RTD service standards are depicted in the charts to help make judgments about performance. Each
rectangle labeled by service type represents the domain for routes that meet or exceed minimum
performance requirements for that service class. Minimums are defined statistically to represent routes
meeting or exceeding 10% of the performance for all routes in each category. So this is a case where
it’s bad to be “outside the box”.
Routes that perform minimally get minimum service frequency, typically every 30 minutes during peak
periods and 60 minutes off-peak. The charts also depict guidelines for routes where ridership
significantly exceeds the minimum, and passenger loads justify more frequent service. The orange,
dotted, vertical line at 25 boardings per hour represents the typical minimum productivity for a route to
justify 15-minute frequency, and the green line at 40 boardings per hour for 10-minute frequency.
Please note that these are true apples-to-apples comparisons of performance: all fare revenues,
boardings and costs-both operating and amortized capital-are included. For complete, detailed
information see RTD’s Service Standards (attachment B).

 Boardings: Unlinked passenger trips; includes transfers as boardings.
 Hours: In-service, vehicle hours, not including dead head garage time or layover/recovery.
 Fare Revenues: Cash, ticket, & tokens allocated by route by farebox recorded boardings.
Monthly pass revenues are allocated by class of pass and the number of uses by route.
Revenue from Eco, CU, and Auraria passes are allocated individually by the counts for each
route weighted by the ratio of the class of service fare to the local fare.
 Costs: All operating, maintenance and administrative costs for providing current service, plus
depreciation on all RTD assets. Excludes interest and any costs attributed to future projects.
RTD’s cost allocation model allocates costs to each route based on its miles, hours, and peak
vehicles. Individual accounting line items are assigned to the most relevant variable by the
model.
 Subsidy: Costs minus Fare Revenues.
Standards
RTD has established guidelines in its Service Standards that the least productive 10% of routes
based on either subsidy per boarding or boardings per hour need to be evaluated for
marketing, revision or elimination, or if both measures fall below 25% for a route. The
performance charts illustrate the acceptable performance domain containing all routes meeting
the 10% minimums for each class of service. The calculation of the 10% and 25% standards are
made from the annual, un-weighted data, assuming the data have a normal distribution and
using the appropriate formulas for standard deviation and confidence intervals; however, the
standard deviation is applied to the weighted average. The following table gives the current
year weighted averages and standards by class of service.

Definitions

2.C.1.c

The following routes were discontinued or merged January 2012 due to budget needs for “right-sizing”
RTD services and based on their performance: #2 East 1st Ave, #4 Morrison Rd, #44Ltd 44th Ave, #48X
Green Valley Ranch merged with #47X, #58X West 58th, Route #60 South Pierce converted into South
Jeffco CnR, Route #63X Lockheed/Waterton converted into South Jeffco CnR, #79 East Florida Ave
replaced by 79/83Ltd, #93X, #121 Peoria Ltd merged into #121, #203 Boulder/Lafayette Via Baseline
merged with #225, #301 & #302 & #303 converted into Longmont CnR, Superior CnR.
The following provides status as of January 2014, listed in route number order.
Route 3 Ltd East Alameda — This is a well utilized route that easily meets the boardings per hour
standard. However, its subsidy per boarding is higher than most other CBD Local routes because the
3Ltd is a peak period, peak direction only service and is thus more expensive to operate.
Route 6X Federal Center Station/I-25&Broadway – Discontinued April 2013 with the West Corridor
restructuring.
Route 9 West 10th Ave – Restructured April 2013 with the West Corridor restructuring.
Route 31X North Federal – This route will continue to be monitored.
Route 32 West 32nd Ave/City Park — This route dipped below the subsidy standard for the second
time in 2011. January 2012 service east of downtown was discontinued on weekends and midday
frequency reduced; discontinued night service west of downtown. It currently meets the boardings
standard.
Route 34 West 3rd Avenue Commuter —This is a small route that has been restructured several
times in recent years and serves passengers with disabilities.
Route 45 Montbello/Green Valley Ranch – Significant portions of this route are under development;
performance will be monitored.
Routes 47X Green Valley Ranch/Montbello Express — This route was combined with the Route 48X
Green Valley Ranch Express for improved performance overall January 2012. This route is only
marginally below standards. It will be replaced by the Airport Line in 2016.
Route 48 East 48th Ave/Commerce City – While the Route 48 serves the Central Business District, a
significant portion of the route serves a lower density industrial area that includes RTD District Shops
and Platte Division.
Route 54 Montbello Industrial Park — Discontinued off-peak service January 2012 and service
reduced further for January 2014.
Route 79Ltd – This route was newly reinstated and it appears that it will meet standards in 2013.
Route 80X West 80th – This route will continue to monitored.

Notes on Routes Outside Their Acceptable Performance Domain

2.C.1.c

Route 116X South Simms – Restructured April 2013 with the West Corridor restructuring.
Route 145X Brighton/DIA Express – This is a policy route that just barely misses standards.
Route 209 CU/Table Mesa PnR – Route restructured with August 2013 service change.
Route 323 Skyline Crosstown — Restructured Longmont routes January 2013.
Route 324 – Main St Crosstown - Restructured Longmont routes January 2013.
Route 326 Northside Loop Clockwise — Restructured Longmont routes January 2013.
Route 327 Northside Loop Counterclockwise — Restructured Longmont routes January 2013.
Route 401 Ranches Crosstown — Discontinued midday weekday and weekend service west of Mineral
Station and replaced with S Jeffco call-n-Ride January 2012. This route currently meets the boardings
standard. Service reduced in January 2014.
Route 403 Lucent Blvd — Service realigned for January 2014.
Route 410 Franktown/Parker — This route was substantially revised with the reinstatement of Route P
Parker/Denver spring 2007. Service was reduced to every 30 minutes peak and every two hours midday.
Service was reduced to peak period only May 2009. Additional trips added January 2014 in response to
public meetings where constituents noted that this would make the route more attractive. Will be
monitored for response.
Route DD Boulder/Colorado Blvd —Due to declining ridership from the University Hospital move to
Anshutz-Fitzsimons Medical Center, service has been steadily reduced for several years; it will eventually
be discontinued and fully replaced by the Route DM Boulder/Anshutz-Fitzsimons.
Route J Longmont/East Boulder – Current ridership meets the minimum standard, though subsidy level
falls short of the standard. This route will be continue to be monitored and is under consideration in the
NAMS study.
Route R/RC Brighton/Denver — Additional service was added in January 2011 to attract additional
riders. This route will be monitored for its performance.
Route T Boulder/Greenwood Plaza — This route was discontinued November 2006 with the opening of
the Southeast Corridor. Responding to customer complaints, the RTD Board reinstated the route in
March 2007. This route will be revisited when Union Station construction provides the needed bus-rail
connections.
Route AA Wagon Road/DIA — Performance is just slightly below subsidy/boarding, but meets
boarding/hour standard. Will be monitored.
Route YL Lyons/Longmont - Discontinued this grant funded service January 2014.

Attachment: Notes on Routes Outside Their Acceptable Performance Domain - Attachment C (1871 : Service Performance 2012)

Route 100X South Kipling - Restructured April 2013 with the West Corridor restructuring.

Belleview Call-n-Ride – This is a new grant funded Call-n-Ride and is being monitored. Changed the flex
route portion to on-demand January 2014.
Highlands Ranch Call-n-Ride — It was proposed to discontinue service in 2009; however, the RTD Board
chose, according to policy, to retain it due to lack of alternatives and the high proportion of riders with
disabilities.
Federal Heights Call-n-Ride - This is a new grant funded Call-n-Ride and is being monitored.
C-Line Rail — This line is only slightly below standards.
E-Line Rail — This line easily meets boardings per hour standard and is slightly below the subsidy per
boarding standard. The ridership performance was affected by a cost savings effort in the January 2012
service change.

RTD Funding of DUSPA Project

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorizes the General Manager to contribute the 2012 $3.3 million working capital advance to the
Denver Union Station Project Authority (DUSPA) towards completion of the Denver Union Station project
and relieve the related receivable as of December 31, 2013.
BACKGROUND
The Denver Union Station Project Authority is constructing the $480 million Denver Union Station
redevelopment project which is funded through a combination of federal loans, state and federal grants,
land sale proceeds, an RTD bond, and FasTracks funds. When the $480 million project is completed, all
project elements will belong to RTD. To date RTD has contributed approximately $222.8 million, which
is comprised of a $168 million RTD Bond and a combination of FasTracks-funded project planning,
oversight and change order costs.
The Denver Union Station (DUS) project is comprised of multiple elements. The light rail plaza opened in
May 2012 and the underground bus complex will open to the public on May 9, 2014. The project is a
key element for the FasTracks vision and will be the central multi-modal hub of the RTD transit system.
It will be recognized as the “Grand Central Station” of the metropolitan area in the heart of the city.
Through its 22 bus bays and light rail and commuter rail platforms the station is designed to
accommodate up to 10,000 people per hour.
DISCUSSION
In March 2012, the RTD Board of Directors authorized an advance of up to $6 million in funds to the
Denver Union Station Project Authority. This advance was authorized to provide working capital to the
project since DUSPA’s funding sources could only be accessed on a reimbursement basis after
expenditures had been made. In December 2012, RTD advanced approximately $3.3 million from Block
A land sale proceeds of the authorized $6 million. Of the $3.3 million advance, DUSPA used $1 million
to convert the Tail Tracks Plaza to a platform walkway and sitting area. The remaining funds were used
to build Wynkoop Plaza.
When the $3.3 million advance was made in December 2012, RTD recorded the $3.3 million as a
receivable from DUSPA to indicate that the funds were anticipated to be paid back at a future date. In
addition, an allowance for $3.3 million dollars was recorded in the event that DUSPA would be unable to
repay these funds. An allowance is required under conservative accounting principles when the
possibility of an inability to repay exists. The project has a fixed amount of funding available for project
completion and there was some uncertainty of remaining costs at the time. This method of accounting
effectively offsets the receivable leaving no future negative impact to RTD’s fund balances.
As the project approaches completion, it is clear that all funds DUSPA has received are needed to
complete the project. If DUSPA were to repay the advance to RTD, DUSPA would have to borrow those
funds, thereby incurring interest and increasing the project cost to RTD. After careful consideration,

Packet Pg. 55

3.B.1

staff has determined that contributing the $3.3 million to the project and relieving the receivable would
be the best course of action. With an effective date of December 31 2013, we would remove the
receivable and its allowance from RTD’s balance sheet while showing the $3.3 million invested in the
RTD owned capital asset.
In the future, RTD may realize a financial benefit to compensate for the additional $3.3 million project
funding from the possible early retirement of DUSPA’s debt. DUSPA’s debt obligations are funded
through tax increment financing (TIF) generated from property, sales and lodging taxes in the DUS taxing
district as well as the RTD bond. Due to accelerated development in the TIF district, DUSPA is currently
receiving TIF revenues at a rate higher than originally forecasted in the financial plan. These excess TIF
revenues will be applied toward the early payment of outstanding principal on DUSPA’s TIFIA and RRIF
loans. If these two loans are repaid before RTD meets the entirety of the RTD bond payment schedule
(approximately $12 million per year for 30 years) RTD’s bond obligations to DUSPA will cease at that
time. Because DUSPA would not have to borrow the $3.3 million, this has the potential of saving RTD
at least $3.3 million in future bond payments.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Because the receivable allowance was recorded in 2012, there will be no financial impact. Approval of
this action item would simply result in a financial statement entry at December 31, 2013.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Approve the staff recommendation to authorize the General Manager to contribute the $3.3 million
working capital advance to the Denver Union Station Project Authority (DUSPA) towards completion of
the Denver Union Station project and relieve the related receivable.
2. Do not approve the staff recommendation and wait until project close-out to see if DUSPA has funds
to repay RTD. This is not the recommended action because it is unlikely that there will be funds
remaining which would cause DUSPA to borrow additional funds thereby increasing the cost to RTD.
3. Do not approve staff recommendation and seek repayment options through alternate means.

BACKGROUND SUMMARY
The RTD Management Directive for “Accountability for RTD Equipment” requires that
“The responsible department will do a physical inventory of attractive equipment
(exception IT computer equipment) to ensure the completeness and accuracy of the
Districts’ records at least once a year or any time key personnel are reassigned or leave
RTD. The IT division will be responsible for a yearly physical inventory of computer
equipment and related items.” RTD defines Attractive Equipment as “…. tangible,
nonexpendable, non-capitalized equipment that is considered relatively portable and
easily converted to personal use or benefit that had an original purchase price over
$500 …”

AUDIT SCOPE
Our review compared the physical existence of “attractive equipment” within the
Communications Department to listings maintained in our work paper files, which are
updated on an annual basis. We did not examine ‘IT Computer Equipment’ as these
lists are tested annually by the IT Division.

CONCLUSION
Several old, obsolete items that were noted in our 2012 testing have been disposed of,
as suggested in our prior report. During this current review, we updated department
schedules for ‘Attractive Equipment’ and verified the existence of such assets.

CURRENT STATUS
There were no reportable findings in this year’s report.

REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
AUDIT REPORT # 13-08-11
DECEMBER 16, 2013

BACKGROUND SUMMARY
This is an annual audit mandated by the Board of Directors. It is an in depth review of
the District investments and the received income to ensure accuracy of reporting and
compliance with the Board of Director’s Investment Policy.

SCOPE
Based on the work performed during the preliminary survey and the assessment of risk,
the audit period covered the operations of RTD Investments from July 1, 2012 to June
30, 2013.

OBJECTIVES
The objectives of the audit were to ensure that investments are conducted and
controlled in accordance with the Investment Policy and the Investment Contract.

CONCLUSION
Investments are being conducted, controlled and monitored effectively. A few areas
were identified where the internal controls could be stronger as follows:
Internal Audit found no evidence of review of the monthly reconciliations prepared by
the Investment and Debt Accountant, by any member of the Finance Team. Internal
Audit recommended review of the reconciliations, with visible evidence of the reviews.
Management agreed that the review will be conducted by the Manager of Accounting.
In addition, the Manager of Investment/Debt will verify investment inventory with trustee
and bank statements. A signature and date of review will be documented in both cases.
In addition, Internal Audit found that there were no back-up arrangements for the
Investment and Debt Accountant. Internal Audit recommended training or cross training
as a minimum to ensure that in case of absence, continuity is assured. As a result Staff
Accountant position is currently being recruited and when the position is filled, the
individual will be trained and will back-up the Investment and Debt Accountant.
In 2014 Internal Audit will follow up to ensure that the agreed upon recommendations
have been implemented.

MILENDER WHITE CONSTRUCTION CO.
REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
AUDIT REPORT # 13-10-17
NOVEMBER 27, 2013

BACKGROUND SUMMARY
RTD contracted with Milender White Construction Co. for renovations to the historic
Denver Union Station building. In part, these renovations will facilitate the return of
Amtrak station and offices to the historic building early in 2014. The renovations will be
paid for using the FASTER Transit Grant received by RTD on August 9, 2011. The
effective date of the contract was May 12, 2012. The total contract sum is $5,000,000
with $1,200,000 lump sum for the design plus $3,800,000 (Not-to-Exceed) for the
construction phase based upon Schedule of Values lump sums and/or cost plus fee.

SCOPE
The scope included a review of the work done, the payments made and level of
completion claimed. The period under review was from May 2012 to December 2013.

OBJECTIVES
The objectives of the audit were to:
1. Determine whether the selection of the contract was properly justified.

2. Ensure that the contract was valid, properly authorized and approved.
3. Ensure that all invoice charges were valid, reasonable, accurate and according to
the terms and conditions of the contract.
4. Ensure contract compliance by RTD and the contractor.

CONCLUSION
The selection of the contractor was properly justified. The contract was valid, properly
authorized and approved. Payment was only made on invoice charges that were valid,
reasonable, accurate and according to terms of the contract. There was compliance by
both RTD and the contractor. The final payment was not processed at the time of the
audit as completion is expected early in 2014.

REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
PAYROLL AUTHORIZATIONS and CLASSIFICATIONS:
BASE VS FASTRACKS
AUDIT REPORT # 13-10-18

BACKGROUND SUMMARY
RTD employees routinely charge their work time and corresponding salaries to either
Company 01 – Base; or Company 02 – FasTracks. These costs are accumulated and
utilized for various reporting purposes and budgetary forecasting models within RTD.
FasTrack project costs can be reimbursed through revenue generated by the special
.4% additional sales tax that was approved by voters in 2004 and is currently in place.

AUDIT SCOPE
Our audit included a review of various employees’ time and salary charges within a
recent Pay Period, and a determination of whether those employees were properly
recorded on the General Ledger, as either Company 01 or 02, depending on their title
and role within the organization.

CONCLUSION
Internal Audit’s testing did not identify any employees who are considered to be
Company 01 Base, but whose costs were charged to Company 02 FasTracks. We did
note selected employees who are charged fully to Base, but who appear to spend
significant time on FasTracks projects.
We have suggested that a policy statement be developed to more clearly define the
guidelines for charging employee costs to either Base or FasTracks. However, Finance
management is not currently in favor of documenting these guidelines and feels that
strict budget controls have been put in place. Through the job offer, approval process,
and current accounting controls, management believes there is adequate data integrity
and separation of funding sources. Due to the complexity in maintaining this practice,
management feels individual review of each job and the related benefits should
continue and that a written policy could weaken the controls that are in place.

CURRENT STATUS
Internal Audit continues to encourage RTD management to formulate written policies
and procedures to enable a more effective and targeted payroll allocation process, while
still maintaining the appropriate tracking to ensure that FasTracks vs Base (Company
02 vs Company 01) expenditures remain properly separated.

P-CARD AGREEMENT
REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
AUDIT REPORT # 13-10-16
NOVEMBER 27, 2013

BACKGROUND SUMMARY
RTD is currently participating in the State of Colorado Master Contract for Credit Card
Services CMS# 26552 – a revenue generating agreement. The period of performance is
from the effective date of the contract until December 2015 with the option through
December 31, 2018. The estimated annual P-Card expenditure was $3,375,714.00.
RTD receives a rebate twice each year based on the volume of P-Card purchases. In
2012, RTD spent $1,683,819 (partial year) and in 2013, $5,099,006 under the State of
Colorado Master Contract for Credit Card Services, CMS# 26552. The total rebate
generated to date is $75,810.
OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE
The objectives of the audit were to ensure that the awarding process was justified, there
was compliance by both parties with the terms of the contract, there was appropriate
documentation and approval of all invoices paid and to confirm receipt of the
deliverables described in the contract. The audit excluded review of actual purchases
with the cards. The scope included 2012 and 2013.
CONCLUSION
Internal Audit found that monthly card limits range from $500 to $40,000 and appeared
to be assigned without recourse to the individual’s position, authority or departments’
budgets. Internal audit recommended further review of the monthly limits. Management
has agreed and the initial review should be completed early in 2014.
Internal Audit found it necessary to improve the policy in the areas relating to
purchasing from Vendors with RTD Purchase Orders and the purchase of Food and
Alcoholic Beverages. Management agreed to changes in the policy to highlight the
areas.
Internal Audit will follow up to confirm the changes in 2014.

BACKGROUND SUMMARY
Bus spare parts inventories are maintained in several locations, with the majority
housed in the Central Warehouse, within the Denver District Shops maintenance facility.
Parts from this location are often transferred to other maintenance facilities within the
RTD network.
During 2011, RTD’s internal parts recordkeeping was converted to the Maximus system
as the primary ‘transaction system of record’. Via interface, the Oracle software
continues to be used as a basis for Accounting’s financial records. Per the October
2013 RTD Trial Balance, total Repair Parts Inventory is approximately $29 million for all
locations and there are about 27,000 different spare parts listed for the bus and light rail
fleet on the inventory system.
Management relies on the primary control process by which the inventory system
selects a sample of individual items to be test counted and compared to the perpetual
inventory records on a daily basis.
AUDIT SCOPE
Our review concentrated on the procedures in place to ensure the accuracy of bus
spare parts and supplies inventory records and emphasized the process of daily
inventory sample counts in the Central Warehouse.

CONCLUSION
Based on the results of our testing, it appears that system generated daily inventory
counts are performed, differences are researched and resolved, and perpetual inventory
records are adjusted when necessary. We have suggested that the current process
guidelines, which are contained in multiple narratives, be consolidated into one concise
document which can be utilized by any employee who participates in the daily test count
process.

CURRENT STATUS
Mutually agreed upon corrective action is underway and will be subject to normal Audit
follow-up review in 2014.

SIMMONS MACHINE TOOLS CORPORATION
MAINTENANCE CONTRACT
REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
AUDIT REPORT # 13-09-15

BACKGROUND SUMMARY
Simmons Machine Tools Corporation bought Hegenscheidt-MTD, the manufacturer of
the Wheel Lathe owned and used by RTD to maintain the Light Rail train wheels. As
such, Simmons is the only company with access to the error codes and programs
necessary to repair the Wheel Lathe, a machine that is critical to Light Rail operations.
Simmons will not entertain calls for maintenance without a Purchase Order in place
prior to a call out. RTD has contracted with Simmons for three years for quarterly,
annual and emergency service visits to ensure the timeliness and quality of the service
on the only electronic Wheel Lathe owned.

SCOPE
The scope included review of the contract and the Wheel Lathe together with the
maintenance of the Wheel Lathe by RTD and Simmons Machine Tools Corporation.
The period under review included January 1, 2013 to November 6, 2013.
OBJECTIVES
The objectives of the audit were to:
1.
Determine whether the selection of the contractor was properly justified.
2.
Ensure that the contract was valid, properly authorized and approved.
3.
Ensure that all invoice charges were valid, reasonable, accurate and according to
the terms and conditions of the contract.
4.
Ensure contract compliance by RTD and the contractor.

CONCLUSION
The Wheel Lathe is a large machine that is critical to the Light Rail Operations.
Together, RTD Staff and Simmons do a proper job of ensuring that the machine is
continuously well maintained. Simmons owns the error codes for the machine, making it
necessary to engage in a sole source contract; the selection was properly justified. The
contract was properly authorized and approved.
Invoice charges were valid,
reasonable, accurate and according to terms of the contract. There was compliance by
both RTD and the contractor.

BACKGROUND SUMMARY
RTD has elected to implement the Smart Media Technology (SMT) system on its buses
and train platforms using a ‘phased in’ approach. Phase One was introduced in
January 2013, and was intended to gather ridership data from ECO, Neighborhood, and
College pass programs.
The system is being built by ACS Transport Solutions, a subsidiary of Xerox. Various
testing and pilot programs are utilized by RTD personnel before each new phase of the
system is approved for use. Stored Value capability, which will allow cardholders to
purchase credit on their Smart Cards and then utilize that credit when riding RTD buses
or light rail, is expected during 2014. With this enhancement, other fare media such as
Monthly Passes, etc. will eventually be converted from current paper passes to Smart
Cards. Software development is continuing and is tested by RTD staff to validate
proper functioning before going ‘live’ throughout the RTD transit system.

AUDIT SCOPE
Utilizing a System Development Life Cycle audit approach, our examination has
included a review of both the development procedures used to build the system; and
testing to ensure processes will function as desired when it goes live.

CONCLUSION
During 2013, the Project Team identified several critical issues which were then closely
monitored and handled in a timely manner by various Team Members.
RTD Internal Audit has again suggested that appropriate Project Team members
document potential system risks and offsetting controls in the live, operating
environment before implementing Stored Value capability, in 2014.

CURRENT STATUS
Internal Audit will continue to be involved with this project and will ensure that mutually

REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
SMART MEDIA TECHNOLOGY PROJECT
3rd INTERIM AUDIT REPORT # 13-11-19

3.C.1.a

BACKGROUND SUMMARY
RTD has developed a prescribed set of policies and procedures which direct the
ongoing preventive maintenance requirements for buses in the organization’s fleet.
These provide guidance for mechanics performing inspections at specific mileage
intervals. Automated tracking is utilized to ensure that buses are taken out of service
and inspections are completed when due.
Inspection checklists, necessary repair work orders, mechanic comments, etc. are
documented within the Maximus system for ongoing record keeping. Significant
maintenance items which are identified during scheduled inspections are rated as ‘Out
of Service’ issues, if required to be repaired immediately, before the bus can return to
normal passenger use.
The FTA review, which was conducted at RTD earlier this year, reported no significant
findings in the area of bus preventive maintenance.

AUDIT SCOPE
Internal Audit reviewed the controls which ensure buses are thoroughly inspected in
accordance with prescribed mileage intervals, and needed repairs are adequately
completed before the bus is returned to service.

CONCLUSION
Based on the results of our testing, buses are routinely inspected in a complete and
timely manner. Needed maintenance is identified and completed as necessary to
maintain the safety of bus operations. There were no reportable findings which required
a response from management.

CURRENT STATUS
This audit is considered closed at this time.

Fourth Quarter 2013 Investment Report

INFORMATION
Please find the District’s investment report for the fourth quarter of 2013 attached.
The U.S. economy expanded at a rate of 3.2% percent during the fourth quarter of 2013. The national
unemployment rate declined to 6.7% and general inflationary pressures remain tame.
In order to promote economic recovery, the Federal Reserve chose to continue with its accommodative
monetary policy and leave the federal funds target rate range (0.0% - 0.25%) unchanged during the
fourth quarter noting that this level will continue to “be appropriate at least as long as unemployment
remains above 6.5% and inflation expectations continue to be well anchored”. The Federal Reserve also
announced that it would begin winding down its $85 billion a month bond purchase program by $10
billion a month beginning in January.
The District’s Investment Policy (the “Policy”) is conservative in nature and seeks to satisfy the three
primary objectives of: safety, liquidity and yield, in that order of importance.
The Policy specifies that:
“Quarterly reports shall outline the District’s total investment return and compare the portfolio’s
performance to a publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics
to the portfolio or sub-portfolio being measured. For the liquidity tier of the portfolio (cash and cash
equivalents), the specified index shall be the 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index as published by Bank of
America Merrill Lynch for the period being measured. For the enhanced cash portion of the portfolio
(securities maturing between 90 days and 5 years and with a target duration of 1 year), the designated
performance benchmark will be the Merrill Lynch 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.”
The total return on the liquidity and enhanced cash tiers of the District’s unrestricted portfolio and
investment benchmarks were as follows:

The yield of the District’s unrestricted portfolio through the fourth quarter of 2013 was 0.60% which
would produce annualized earnings of $1.519 million. The current return for the month of December
was 0.29%.
