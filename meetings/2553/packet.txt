BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

Date: November 29, 2016

From:

Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

November 29, 2016

Board Meeting Date: December 20, 2016

Subject:

Local Government Liaison Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Government Relations Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the
General Manager to enter into Contract No. 16-DO-025 for Local Government Liaison services with CRL
Associates, Inc. (CRL) for three years (January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2019), at a cost of
$102,000 per year, and for two (2) additional one-year options to renew at prices specified in the
Contract, each option period contingent upon approval by the Board of Directors pursuant to the
Contract Award agreement.
BACKGROUND
In September 2016, RTD issued a Request for Proposals for Local Government Liaison Services. Eight
potential bidders looked at the RFP, but only one responded to this request. The procurement panel is
recommending to the Government Relations Committee the selection of CRL Associates, Inc. as RTD’s
Local Government Liaison with the elected officials and staff of the cities and counties of the Denver
metropolitan area, as well as the business community and economic development organizations. This
team has broad knowledge of RTD’s needs and concerns, as well as an extensive network of
relationships with local governments, elected officials, and stakeholders along the Front Range. The
proposal was submitted for the period of January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2019, with the
potential for two (2) one-year option periods. The Government Relations Committee will make future
annual recommendations to the Board of Directors at the end of each contract period regarding the
exercise of future option periods.
DISCUSSION
CRL Associates, Inc. as RTD’s Local Government Liaison maintains contact with the elected officials and
staff of the cities and counties of the Denver metropolitan area, as well as the business community and
economic development organizations. This team has a broad knowledge of RTD’s needs and concerns,
as well as an extensive network of relationships with local governments, elected officials, and
stakeholders along the Front Range.
As part of the Local Government Liaison services, frequent contact will be made with RTD staff and the
Chairman of the Board to ascertain a coordinated plan to monitor and report on activities at the city and
county levels of government. In addition, as part of the coordinated plan, CRL will provide regular
outreach to the business community and economic development organizations in the Metro area to
develop partnerships and garner feedback on RTD issues of concern.
CRL will represent RTD at meetings at the local level of government and provide professional advice,
counsel, and analysis of issues regarding local government activities as they relate to RTD. CRL will also
provide Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) liaison services.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for 2017 is included in the annual budget and future years will be included in the respective
annual budgets.

1.C.1

ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Government Relations Committee that the Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager to enter into Contract No. 16-DO-025 for Local Government Liaison services
with CRL Associates, Inc. (CRL) for three years (January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2019),
at a cost of $102,000 per year, and for two (2) additional one-year options to renew at prices
specified in the Contract, each option period contingent upon approval by the Board of Directors
pursuant to the Contract Award agreement.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. A new Request for Proposals could be sent to
interested parties, and a new Local Government Liaison firm could be retained. This action is not
recommended because CRL Associates, Inc. has been very effective in assisting RTD with local
government matters in the past, and this group is very familiar with RTD’s issues and policies.
This option is also not recommended because a valid RFP process was utilized for this
procurement.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

Date: November 29, 2016

From:

Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

November 29, 2016

Board Meeting Date: December 20, 2016

Subject:

Federal Liaison Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the RTD Government Relations Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager to enter into an agreement for federal liaison services with Squire Patton
Boggs LLP to exercise a one-year option (January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017) to extend
Contract No. 14-DX-001, at a cost of $264,000. Funding for this contract is included in the 2017
budget.
BACKGROUND
A solicitation for proposals for Federal Liaison Services was issued on August 12, 2014. This
solicitation was a Best Value Procurement where technical factors and cost were all considered. Ten
responsive proposals were received, and they were evaluated by a five-member evaluation committee
that recommended Squire Patton Boggs LLP. The recommendation of the evaluation committee was
subsequently referred to the Government Relations Committee on November 11, 2014.
The
Government Relations Committee recommended that Squire Patton Boggs LLP be offered a new contract
for a five-year period. Squire Patton Boggs has been RTD’s federal lobbyist since 2000 and has assisted
in RTD’s receiving over $2.5 billion in federal grants and loans. In addition to constant monitoring of
Congressional and Executive Branch activities, status reports are issued and special reports are prepared
when significant events occur in the federal government.
DISCUSSION
Constant monitoring of federal legislative activities that relate to RTD is required, and RTD’s interests
must be conveyed to appropriate members of Congress, including the Colorado delegation and other key
Congressional committee members. The Squire Patton Boggs team has excellent rapport and respect
from the Colorado delegation and serves as a resource for the delegation staff. When RTD has a Full
Funding Grant Agreement (FFGA) in place as it now does (Eagle P3 Project), the annual appropriations
process requires intense attention to committee hearings and to the status of the Congressional budget
process. In addition, in 2016 RTD received a $92 million Full Funding Grant Agreement for the
Southeast Rail Extension (SERE), which entailed extensive contacts with the Colorado Congressional
delegation. Significant lobbying efforts were required to follow the steps to ensure being awarded the
annual appropriations in the current Eagle P3 FFGA, as well as procuring the SERE FFGA.
The MAP-21 Continuing Resolution expired on May 31, 2015, and the federal lobbyists played a key role
in representing RTD’s needs in the new authorization bill—Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act
(FAST Act). With the build out of FasTracks, the lobbyists will need to be especially attentive to the
federal financing needs for the unfunded corridors, and they will monitor the possibility of new funding
sources in the FAST Act and advocate for RTD’s best interests.
In addition to helping with Congressional activities, assistance is also necessary with the Executive
Branch of the federal government, including the Department of Transportation (the Federal Transit
Administration and the Federal Railroad Administration). Squire Patton Boggs provides guidance and
assistance in applying for and receiving federal funds from the Department of Transportation.

Packet Pg. 6

1.C.2

For the American Public Transportation Association (APTA) Legislative Conference in March each year,
Squire Patton Boggs staff advises which offices are critical to visit or are of relevant interest for
board/staff visits. Then, the Squire Patton Boggs team sets the meeting times on behalf of RTD.
The Denver office of Squire Patton Boggs serves as important advisory role in RTD’s connection to
relevant national personnel and issues. In addition, annually, or as required, meetings with the Board of
Directors are also held.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Government Relations Committee’s Recommended Action to exercise a one-year
option (January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017) at a cost of $264,000 ($22,000 per
month) with Squire Patton Boggs LLP.
2. Continue the contract on a month-to-month basis, if amenable to the current Contractor
(Squire Patton Boggs LLP). This option is not recommended because continuity and stability
in liaison services is an important consideration.
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action and issue a new Request for Proposals (RFP) for
Federal Liaison Services. This option is not recommended because RTD’s RFP process was
properly utilized for this procurement.

Local Government Relations Update

The following are items for December 6, 2016:
1. November Election Results – In addition to the RTD elections, local elections were held

in Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Douglas and Jefferson Counties, as well as the Town of
Parker. Four new commissioners were elected. Eleven officials were re-elected. Attached
is a contact list of those elected and re-elected in November.
2. MPACT64 – The Metro Mayors Caucus (MMC) and the Denver Regional Council of
Governments (DRCOG) are reconvening the MPACT64 coalition on December 8th to
discuss transportation funding needs and possible solutions. This meeting will “pick up
where they left off” to see if there is a formula that could unite our urban, mountain and
rural areas around a statewide funding proposal. As you may recall, MPACT64 was
originally comprised of four regional organizations that collectively span Colorado’s 64
counties: MMC, Progressive 15, Action 22 and Club 20. In 2012, MPACT64 adopted a
series of Transportation Principles to address mobility needs in Colorado’s rural, resort
and urban communities. Polling at the time indicated insufficient support to move
forward with a new funding measure.
3. Transportation Funding – In addition to the MPACT64 meeting, several stakeholder,
business and industry groups are actively meeting to discuss transportation/transit needs.
These groups are working with legislative leaders to evaluate various funding options,
discuss how new revenue might be allocated, and assess the viability for voter approval.
Since much of this is occurring “under the dome”, CRL is staying closely coordinated
with Brandeberry McKenna regarding implications to RTD.
4. Metro Mayors Caucus Annual Retreat – The MMC will hold its annual retreat on January
14, 2017. The agenda is not finalized, but certainly will include discussions about
transportation/transit funding and next steps.

What is the state of play on transportation
issues in Washington?
• Lame Duck session:
• Only one of the 12 spending bills has been passed for the fiscal year that

started on October 1. Federal government agencies and programs are
operating under a short-term spending bill (a “CR”) that expires on
December 9.

• Republican-led House and Senate are waiting out Obama’s final weeks in

office; with no incentive to compromise, few bills expected to be passed
– funding for Flint water crisis, national defense.

• Fiscal Year 2017 Transportation/HUD Appropriations Bill:
• Controls funding for New Starts projects, TIGER program for FY 2017.
• Under any CR: short-term extension of FY 2016 levels for transit

formula programs under the FAST Act; no discretionary grant
awards.

• A big infrastructure bill in first 100 days of the next Congress?

FY 2017 Appropriations Outlook
• Deadline: Members of Congress are eager to pass another spending bill
before December 9 deadline.
• Another CR: House and Senate Appropriations Committees negotiating
another short-term spending bill – through to the Spring – to allow the
incoming Trump Administration to have the final say in FY 2017 spending
priorities.
• Final transportation spending levels next Spring: House and Senate 2017
THUD bills both fully fund transit and highway formula programs at their
FY 2017 FAST Act levels.
• TIGER funding: House $450 million, Senate at $525 (FY 2016 TIGER

was $500 million)

• New Starts funding: House $2.50 billion, Senate $2.338 billion (both

above $2.302 billion FY 2017 FAST Act authorization for New Starts)

What does this mean for New Starts funding?
• RTD’s FY 2017 New Starts request:
• $167 million for Eagle P3 FFGA

• President’s FY 2017 budget:
• $175 million for Eagle P3 FFGA

• Pending House and Senate FY 2017 THUD appropriations bills: Both fund the
Eagle project at $150 million.
• US DOT will not award grants in discretionary programs (programs in the

control of the Appropriators) in the absence of a full-year spending bill.

• Bottom Line: Likely that no FY 2017 New Starts funding will be awarded until

after an omnibus spending bill is enacted in the Spring.

Trump’s Infrastructure Proposal
• Much speculation, few specifics.
• Timing: Trump wants to see an infrastructure bill advance early in the next

Congress. Pelosi, other Democrats, have signaled general support for increased
infrastructure funding.

• Revenues gained through tax reform: One-time funding through taxation of all

revenues ($2.6 billion) of US companies held overseas: “deemed” repatriation.

• Finance: tax credit for private investors in infrastructure projects. Funding

component, too?

• Equity investors support a small fraction of transit projects, so tax credit only

part of the solution.

• Infrastructure package should include grant funding; sent out to States

through FAST Act formula programs?

• Regulatory reform: reducing or eliminating burdensome regulations.

Opportunity for HTF Revenue Solution?
• Any infrastructure bill will attract policy riders, large and small.
• Long-sought Highway Trust Fund revenue solution?
• Closing the gap between spending levels and dedicated HTF revenues seen

as “unfinished business” after FAST Act.

• But surface transportation funding is not a must-pass bill:
• FAST Act funds surface transportation programs through 2020.
• Other Trump priorities: trade, immigration could take precedence.
• Competing transportation priorities in FY 2017: FAA reauthorization.
• Some Republicans want to use tax reform only to lower rates, not for new

spending.

• Same politically difficult revenue options: taxes on gasoline, oil and gas

production, vehicle-miles traveled.

• Return of earmarks could enable support for revenue increase for HTF.

Transit Programs in a Trump US DOT
• FAST Act in place through FY 2020:
• Second year into 5-year authorization governing overall funding levels,

transit’s share of HTF revenues, major policies and programs.

• So major changes not expected immediately in surface transportation
programs.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

Date: December 1, 2016

From:

William C. Van Meter,
Manager, Planning

GM

Date:

November 30, 2016

Subject:

Option to Purchase Real Property at 29072915 Welton Street

Assistant

General

Board Meeting Date: December 20, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorizes the General Manager and/or his designee to negotiate and execute all documents necessary
for the grant of an option, and for the sale of the real property located at 2907-2915 Welton Street,
Denver Colorado (the “Property”), including execution of any deeds and other property conveyance
documents.
BACKGROUND
This action addresses the 2016 goal of fiscal sustainability in leveraging RTD assets by selling property
no longer needed by the District for fair market value, and addresses the policy goals of Resolution 17 in
2010, the TOD Strategic Plan by supporting creation of mixed-income housing near transit stations.
RTD originally acquired the property at 29th and Welton in 1993 to replace the on-street parking for local
businesses that was lost during the construction of the Central Corridor LRT. The property is currently a
vacant parking lot used for neighborhood retail parking and is not managed as part of RTD’s parking
management system.
In 2010, the RTD Board adopted the TOD Strategic Plan to create a more focused policy that guides
RTD’s role in encouraging the creation of mixed-income communities near transit. The Board also
approved the TOD Pilot Program to test implementing the new TOD Strategic Plan. Pursuant to that
policy direction, RTD selected the Welton corridor as a Pilot Program site because of a combination of
favorable market conditions for redevelopment and the City and County of Denver’s (the “City’s”)
commitment to revitalization of the Welton Corridor.
In 2013, the Five Points Business District published its Vision Plan Implementation & Revitalization
Strategy, which called for removal of vacant parking lots along the corridor including activation of RTD’s
29th and Welton property. The plan emphasizes the need to retain housing affordability in the Welton
corridor.
Beginning in 2014, RTD staff and the Denver Office of Economic Development (OED) began discussions
around how to partner to implement the community vision established in the Five Points Business
District plan as part of the RTD Pilot Program implementation. In addition, Mayor Hancock has signaled
his eagerness to continue to collaborate with RTD on a new model for mixed-income condominium
construction that helps to achieve the City’s 3x5 Initiative to create or preserve 3,000 affordable homes
in five years by 2018. A letter from Mayor Hancock expressing the City’s commitment to this project is
included in the Board packet, including the City’s willingness to contribute substantial gap financing to
support an appropriate development on the 29th and Welton site.

Packet Pg. 38

2.B.1

RTD and the City have outlined a potential competitive process to solicit developers to build a mixedincome condominium project on the Property. OED would lead the RFQ process, but RTD would
participate in the selection panel. To aid in the successful completion of the developer selection, RTD
and the City need to establish certainty for potential bidders that the property will be available at
previously agreed upon terms. Accordingly, RTD staff request authority to grant an option to purchase
the Property now so that when the City issues the RFQ, it can represent that it holds a right to purchase
the property under the terms of an option agreement.
DISCUSSION
This action would give authority to grant the City and County of Denver an option to purchase the
Property1. In order to exercise the option and complete the purchase, the following conditions must be
met first:
i) successful procurement of a development partner to build a mixed-income condominium
project according to the terms agreed upon by RTD and the City;
ii) the selected developer reaching an agreement on business terms with the City; and
iii) the selected developer securing the financing necessary to complete the project.
The City would also have the right to assign the option to the selected developer, meaning the selected
developer could purchase the property directly from RTD on the same terms as the City and subject to
the same conditions. The term of the option would be two years from the date of its execution, with
the ability to grant two ninety-day extensions if necessary to complete the transaction. The final
purchase price for the Property will be based on a fair market value appraisal of the Property.
If the City fails to exercise the option during the option period, RTD would remain the property owner
and any subsequent decisions about the Property would come back to the Board for approval.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
RTD currently spends approximately $10,000 per year maintaining the property. If the property is sold,
RTD will no longer have this maintenance obligation. If the Option is exercised, RTD will receive the
amount determined by a fair market value appraisal of the Property.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning and Development
Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorizes the General Manager and/or his designee
to negotiate and execute all documents necessary for the grant of an option, and for the sale of
the real property located at 2907-2915 Welton Street, Denver Colorado (the “Property”),
including execution of any deeds and other property conveyance documents.
2. Do not authorize the General Manager and/or his designee to negotiate and execute all documents
necessary for the conveyance of an Option to Purchase the Real Property located at 2907-2915
Welton Street, Denver CO. This is not recommended because RTD does not have any current or
future transit need for the property, and because this would be inconsistent with the goals of the
TOD pilot program previously approved by the Board in December of 2010.

An option to purchase property is the right, but not the obligation, to purchase the property at any time
during the term of the option according to the terms of the option.

Board of Directors
Regional Transportation District
1600 Blake Street
Denver, CO 80202
To the RTD Board of Directors:
This letter is to express the City and County of Denver’s strong and enthusiastic support for the
proposal before you to approve an option agreement between RTD and the city to acquire the
RTD-owned property at 2907-2915 Welton Street for the development of mixed-income
housing.
Since the fall of 2014, Denver’s Office of Economic Development (OED) has been working
closely with the RTD Transit-Oriented Development team to plan for the development of
mixed-income for-sale housing on this site. We look forward to continuing to collaborate on
this joint effort to provide critical affordable homeownership opportunities in the Five Points
neighborhood.
OED’s mission is to advance economic prosperity for the city and its businesses, neighborhoods
and residents. As part of this mission, OED invests federal and local funds in the development
and preservation of a variety of income-qualified housing throughout the city. Each year, OED
invests millions of dollars of gap financing in non-profit and private-sector-led development
projects that add to the city’s stock of affordable housing.
Housing costs in the Denver region are rising out of reach for even moderate-income residents,
with an estimated 100,000 households in Denver County alone paying more than 30% of their
income for housing costs. We recognize the need to invest in affordable housing options not
only to provide shelter for our region’s most vulnerable residents, but also to support the
economic mobility of Denver’s low- and moderate-income families as they become ready to
move into homeownership. To achieve this goal, OED invests in affordable housing units
ranging from supportive housing for the lowest-income residents to for-sale units for
households earning up to the median income.

Due partly to construction defects restrictions, very few for-sale units have been built in Denver
over the last several years, limiting the entry-level housing options available to lower- and
moderate-income homebuyers. The city is eager to continue to collaborate with RTD and a
mutually selected developer to pilot on this site a new model for mixed-income condominium
construction at this location. We are prepared to contribute substantial gap financing to an
appropriate development on this site to support this effort.

Economic & Planning Systems, Inc.

Economic & Planning Systems (EPS) evaluated two land disposition options for the RTD owned
parcels at 29th and Welton. The site is currently used as a RTD parking lot. The first option is a
land sale, where RTD transfers ownership to a buyer in exchange for a lump sum payment. The
second is a ground lease, where a land lessee pays RTD a fee to use the land for a set term. At
the end of the term, RTD takes control of the land and any buildings on it. EPS evaluated the
disposition options on two criteria: (1) the potential limitations on land uses and corresponding
policy goals and (2) the potential monetary value to RTD. In the first criterion, the evaluation
found that the ground lease option limits the potential for residential product in general and
likely precludes residential homeownership. In the second, the evaluation found that the land
sale and ground lease generate similar values.

Land Use Limitations
The ground lease option poses distinct challenges as it relates to housing affordability goals.
Ground leases generally preclude residential ownership products like condominiums. As a result,
this disposition option would limit RTD’s ability to create affordable homeownership on the site.
Moreover, ground leases often increase the interest rate on mortgages for potential buyers,
further complicating affordability. Finally, the market for residential ground leases limits the pool
of prospective developers, creating an additional layer of complexity for lenders and investors. A
weak ground lease market may also reduce the potential value of this option.

Value
In addition to policy considerations, EPS estimated the potential value to RTD for both options.
Based on conservative assumptions, EPS found the option yield almost identical values for RTD
of approximately $1.4 million. The valuation methodology is described briefly:
•

•

Land Sale: EPS evaluated 26 comparable land sales within a one-mile radius of the site
completed since 2010. Based on these comparable transactions, a low, moderate, and
high range of price was established. Based on these prices, EPS estimates a price range
between $1 million and $1.7, with $1.4 million representing the mid-range estimate.
Ground Lease: EPS calculated a present value of the potential stream of cash flows. In
contrast to a land sale, a ground lease tenant pays RTD an annual fee to use the land.
The fee is typically based on a percentage of the land value (around 6.0 percent), and
ground leases typically last 50 or 99 years, with the latter being more common. The long
term nature of the lease allows the tenant to earn a return on any investment or land
improvement. Present value allows for apples-to-apples comparison, translating the
stream of cash values into 2016 dollars. Based on these terms, EPS estimates a range of
values between $1 million and 1.7 million, with a midrange of $1.4 million.

While the two options generate comparable values in most scenarios, EPS found more upside to
ground leases in optimistic scenarios. However, RTD must balance this potential premium with
the policy limitations and market constraints posed by the ground lease. In other words, the
objective of developing affordable ownership condominiums can be accomplished most
effectively with a land sale.

Parking Guiding Principles

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors pass the
attached parking guiding principles resolution to provide policy direction to RTD staff on parking related
issues moving forward.
BACKGROUND
RTD has over 29,000 parking spaces serving its transit system. About 20 percent of RTD riders park at
one of RTD’s park and ride facilities to access the transit system so it represents a significant contingent
of RTD’s ridership. RTD’s ability to manage our parking resources is governed by RTD’s enabling
legislation (C.R.S. Section 32-9-119.9) and there is limited internal policy guidance available for staff to
utilize in analyzing and making decisions on parking related projects.
DISCUSSION
RTD’s recent experience with third party parking agreements has resulted in inconsistencies in the
management and operation of shared facilities. This inconsistency creates challenges for RTD staff to
implement RTD’s current parking management program and complicates issues when considering third
party approaches to potentially charging for parking.
For joint development projects, there is limited guidance in RTD’s Strategic Plan for TOD (2010) about
how to deal with replacement parking. It would benefit staff to have clearly identified criteria to
consider when working on projects involving parking replacement. In addition, RTD’s approach to station
access, which includes the provision of parking, is done with limited policy guidance. Having clear
policy guidance on station access would help with in developing a holistic, balanced approach to the
planning and implementation of station improvements.
It would therefore be beneficial to have guiding principles to provide a base level of direction to staff in
day to day dealings with parking issues. Draft parking guiding principles were presented at the
November 1st P&D Committee meeting. Board feedback on the draft principles was provided at the
meeting.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no expected direct financial impact of this resolution. This resolution requires that financial
implications be considered as part of any decision related to RTD parking.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors pass
the attached parking guiding principles resolution to provide policy direction to RTD staff on
parking related issues moving forward.
2. Do not adopt resolution. Continue to operate with limited policy guidance and allow for
continued inconsistency with parking decisions.

Platte Division Zoning and Land Value

Assistant

General

Board Meeting Date: December 6, 2016
Information

BACKGROUND
On September 19, 2016, the Denver City Council adopted the 38th & Blake Station Area Height
Amendments. Noted in the map below, the Height Amendments allow for greater minimum and
maximum height at several properties northeast of 31st St., including Platte Division, which was rezoned
from light industrial use to a form-based code base height of 8 stories to an incentive height (with
affordable housing, for example) of 12 stories. District Shops, located southeast of 31st St., is not
included in the Height Amendments.

Platte
Division

In light of these Height Amendments, Director Bagley requested RTD staff to consider the impact to
RTD’s property, and RTD staff requested Economic Planning Systems’ (EPS) analytical support. This
Report serves to summarize staff’s and EPS’ findings including the property’s valuation under a sale or
ground lease arrangement.

Packet Pg. 49

2.C.1

DISCUSSION
Based on comparable property values, Platte Division’s value for sale or ground-lease could range from
$82 million to $123 million. However, there are a number of additional factors that RTD should consider
in deciding whether or not to consider disposition of Platte Division. For example, the Height
Amendments encourages residential use, which requires the highest and costliest level of environmental
remediation, thereby potentially reducing the long-time maintenance facility’s sale or ground-lease value
to a prospective buyer, depending on the costs associated with the remediation.
In addition, selling or ground-leasing the property would require replacing the bus-maintenance and
operations services currently handled at the Platte Division. Replacement costs include but are not
limited to the following considerations:






Platte Division’s central location in the RTD system presently reduces deadhead mileage and
operational costs. A satellite location may be unlikely to provide comparable service efficiency.
Moreover, Platte Division’s proximity to District Shops leverages unparalleled operational
efficiencies Although RTD could consider relocating both Platte Division and District Shops to
maintain this convenience, the latter property is not included in the Height Amendments and, so,
RTD would not similarly gain from its disposition.
As centrally located property sells for a substantial price, it is costly to acquire sites comparable
to Platte Division in size or location.
In addition to acquiring property, RTD would need to build a comparable bus-maintenance facility.
Research suggests that cost would be between $80 million to $120 million, excluding land costs.

Perhaps more importantly, market conditions within RiNo, the potential for a constrained land supply as
other sites build out, and the potential for substantial capital investment in and around the neighborhood
with respect to Brighton Blvd. reconstruction and National Western Stock Show redevelopment all
suggest that this site will reach greater value in the future.
