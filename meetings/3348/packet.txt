PRESENTATION LENGTH

BACKGROUND
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires public entities operating a fixed route system to also
provide paratransit service to individuals with disabilities which is comparable to the level of service
provided to individuals without disabilities. RTD’s paratransit services are currently provided by four
service providers: MV Transportation, Via Mobility Services, Transdev and Transdev On-Demand.
RTD also operates FlexRide service in 23 service areas within the District, providing first-and-last mile
connections along with access to essential locations such as grocery stores, hospitals, medical facilities,
employment sites and schools. These services are currently provided by two service providers: MV
Transportation and Via Mobility Services.
Currently, approximately 65% of RTD’s paratransit customer base are regularly using the agency’s
services and FlexRide ridership has been steadily increasing.
A Request for Proposal (RFP) for paratransit services is currently being advertised with proposals due on
August 3, 2022. The contract(s) are scheduled to commence on January 1, 2023. In conference with
Procurement and Legal staff, it was determined that additional time was needed to allow potential
proposers to identify sufficient garage space in this limited real estate market.
The new contracts will provide continuing service at the end of the three-month contract extensions for
the current paratransit service providers. Staff intends to provide the Board with a recommendation at
the October 2022 Board meeting.
DISCUSSION
In adopting this recommended action, RTD seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan priorities of
Community Value and Financial Success. In May 2022, RTD requested cost proposals from current
service providers to continue service through December 31, 2022.

Cost Analysis
An internal financial analysis indicated that the three-month estimated cost for RTD to provide similar
services internally would be $13,616,213 which is $1,907,485 higher than the three-month cost
proposed by the agency’s current service providers.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for the provision of Access-a-Ride and FlexRide services effective, October 1 through December
31, 2022 are included in the 2022 Budget.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
On-Demand Uber Pilot Service Extension

Committee Meeting Date:
July 13, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
July 26, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO or her designee to enter into a
five-month contract extension with Uber for the provision of On-Demand services for paratransit
customers. The total five-month not-to-exceed amount for the contracted service is $887,457.00.

PRESENTATION LENGTH

BACKGROUND
RTD has provided on-demand opt-in service through taxi companies, branded as Access-a-Cab for
Access-a-Ride customers since 2005. While an affordable alternative for RTD paratransit
customers, the taxi industry has been unable to consistently provide services within the needed
response times, particularly to customers using wheelchairs.
In November 2020, RTD expanded its on-demand opt-in service offerings through a more
responsive platform by piloting with Uber as the first Transportation Network Company (TNC). The
pilot area included southeast Denver and was designed to test customer adoption, response times,
and use of wheelchair accessible vehicles.
These services have allowed a more convenient same-day alternative to traditional paratransit
service which is more affordable to customers (i.e., Uber is a $2 fare versus a $5 Access-a-Ride
fare) and more cost-effective for RTD at an up to $20 subsidy per trip versus a more than $75
trip cost through RTD’s dedicated Access-a-Ride service.
Piloting Uber as an additional provider of on-demand service has been positive for RTD customers
and was expanded to the entire RTD service area in January 2022 to parallel Access-a-Cab
service. Since the pilot expansion, RTD has seen the customer adoption increase from 12.6% of
all paratransit customer trips to over 21% in June 2022.
As customer demand has returned, on-demand solutions from Metro Transportation (RTD’s
current Access-a-Cab vendor) and the Uber pilot have recovered to 96% of pre-COVID demand
compared to 66% for Access-a-Ride service.
The challenges of the Access-a-Ride providers to increase their workforce to support customer
demand has greatly reduced paratransit service on-time performance. A continuation of the TNC
pilot program will aid in the expansion of on-demand services, as well as the release of a Request
for Qualifications (RFQ) to retain additional on-demand providers, which is currently being

Packet Pg. 5

advertised with new provider agreements anticipated being brought to the Board of Directors for
its consideration in October 2022.
DISCUSSION
RTD seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan priorities of Community Value and Financial Success
as staff anticipates a minimum of two vendors with the possibility of up to six to deliver paratransit
services. Additionally, an internal financial analysis indicated that the five-month estimated cost for RTD
to provide similar services internally would be $3,849,075.00, which is $2,961,618.00 higher than the
five-month cost proposed by Uber.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for the provision of On-Demand Uber services effective, August 1 through December 31,
2022 are included in the 2022 Budget.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
August 2022 Service Change

Committee Meeting Date:
July 13, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
July 26, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the August 2022 Service Change package as revised and
summarized in Attachment A and to authorize the General Manager and CEO or her designee to execute
contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is impacted by these changes.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Ford, Chief Operations Officer
Jessie Carter, Senior Manager of Service Development
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 minutes
BACKGROUND
Commensurate with the service change and voting process detailed in the Collective Bargaining
Agreement (CBA) between RTD and ATU 1001, the August 2022 Service Change Proposal facilitates
both an opportunity for RTD bus and rail operators to vote new work assignments and the opportunity
for Service Development staff to make adjustments to the operations plan for RTD’s transit network.
The service change process though contractually required, is an opportunity for RTD to update its transit
services, utilizing projected available resources. As of April 19, 2020, RTD has operated a reduced level
of service in response to COVID 19 impacts. As the region and the country move forward from the
various mandates and emergency policies that have affected commerce and mobility, challenges to
workforce availability persist. Like many service-related entities, the transit industry has seen workforce
availability greatly reduced. Recognizing that RTD’s reduced availability of transit operators, mechanics,
amongst other positions, efforts to update RTD’s service plans continue to be focused on providing RTD
customers with sustainable and reliable service within the agency’s available resources.
The service proposals herein are a combination of schedule adjustments and restoration of seasonal
services previously suspended for summer. Efforts to increase operator availability through recruitment
strategies and increased employee outreach continue, though current levels do not support a substantial
increase to service at this time. Additionally, the newly adopted CBA is anticipated to have positive
impacts on both employee retention and recruitment.

DISCUSSION
In alignment with the Strategic Plan priority of Customer Excellence, and recognizing the agency’s
people power problems, the proposals herein are directed at improving on-time performance, maintaining
CBA compliance and adjusting service levels to match summer ridership demand.
The Board adopted guidance for proposed service changes continue to be:
• Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
• The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;

Response to changes in the communities where services are provided.

SUMMARY OF PUBLIC HEARINGS
There were three virtual public hearings conducted on June 2, 2022 at noon and on June 22 at noon
and 5 p.m. These hearings have been recorded and are available for review. Comments from this public
comment period have been summarized and listed in Attachment B of this report.
CHANGES TO INITIAL RECOMMENDATION
Staff receives input during the public comment process and continues to conduct additional analysis
after the initial service recommendations are communicated to the Board of Directors. Depending on the

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Reimagine RTD System Optimization Plan

Committee Meeting Date:
July 13, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
July 26, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the Reimagine RTD System Optimization Plan (SOP), as revised
and summarized in Attachment B, to serve as the service plan through 2027 and to be implemented in a
phased approach at regular service changes as resources are available through that period.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug Monroe, Manager, Corridor Planning (Operations)
Jessie Carter, Senior Manager, Service Development
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 minutes
BACKGROUND
Work began in late 2019 to develop the System Optimization Plan (SOP), a fiscally constrained service
plan, as part of the Reimagine RTD plan. RTD engaged in the SOP development process to respond to
changing travel patterns, to bolster ridership, improve transit service performance and efficiency,
improve transit service quality, and remain a competitive transportation service provider. The effort
began with the Comprehensive Assessment of Services which was released in November 2020.
The SOP was developed through a five-step process
1. Conduct a Comprehensive Assessment of Services
2. Review existing travel patterns against services
3. Review financial capacity
4. Discuss community and agency goals and values
5. Draft and refine SOP
A Technical Working Group (TWG) and Advisory Committee (AC) were formed at the start of the study
effort to provide input and guidance to RTD staff and the consultant team throughout the study process.
The RTD Board of Directors was also engaged through the project effort and significant public input was
gathered through in-person and virtual events.
COVID had a significant impact on the development of the SOP. The original schedule called for
completion of the SOP by late Summer 2020. The project was paused briefly in 2020 in response to
COVID. When the project resumed, the focus of SOP recommendations shifted towards re-building RTD
service in a manner that addresses post-COVID travel trends cognizant of where ridership demand is
returning, while staying within RTD’s fiscal constraints.
Service analyses performed in this study reflect pre-COVID conditions, as this analysis was completed
prior to the pandemic in late 2019. The pandemic has adversely impacted transit ridership for RTD and
every other transit system in the United States. In response to the pandemic, RTD immediately reduced

Packet Pg. 16

1.D.4

its geographic service footprint and span of service on many routes. Weekday service was reduced to
levels similar to pre-pandemic weekend service. RTD closely monitored ridership on routes remaining in
service to limit the number of customers per bus trip, to maintain social distancing. Additional trips were
added to routes when ridership exceeded social distancing requirements.
As noted, work on the SOP was paused in the Fall 2020. When it resumed in 2021, analyses were
completed by RTD to assess COVID ridership impacts after one year of the pandemic. Figure 1 illustrates
ridership retention levels for routes that were still operating in Spring 2021. Major corridor bus routes
such as Routes 15/15L, 16, 31, 40 and 51, retained the highest percentage of pre-pandemic ridership.
Rail ridership was best retained on the A Line.
RTD’s ridership profile by time of day changed significantly as a result of the pandemic, as shown in
Figure 2. Pre-pandemic, there were two significant ridership “peaks” which corresponded with typical
morning and afternoon peak periods. From the start of the pandemic and continuing into 2021, those
“peaks” largely disappeared. Weekday ridership distribution characteristics over a typical day are now
more similar to Saturday ridership characteristics. This reflects a significant reduction in weekday peak
period commute trips. Figure 3 illustrates average daily boardings and platform hours for weekday and
weekend service from August 2019 through June 2021. As shown in this graph, there was a dramatic
drop in weekday ridership and scheduled weekday platform hours. Weekend ridership also dropped, but
at a lower rate. Weekend schedule platform hours have generally remained consistent.
A Title VI equity analysis was completed in Spring 2021 to determine impacts associated with RTD’s
pandemic-related service reductions on equity communities. Systemwide, weekday bus service was
reduced by nearly 40 percent. However, service reductions to low-income block groups were 13 percent
less than to higher-income block groups. Service reductions to minority block groups were 29 percent
less than to non-minority block groups. Low-income and minority block groups also experienced fewer
service reductions defined as a “major service reduction” (i.e., 25 percent or more reduction in service).
Since the completion of the 2021 Title VI equity analysis, additional service has been restored
(particularly starting Fall 2021). Ridership has also begun to return but remains well below pre-COVID
levels. Commuter-oriented routes, such as the 120x/122x and the Flatiron Flyer, have seen a slower
return of ridership than other routes. Unfortunately, RTD is presently limited in further service restoration
due to ongoing frontline staffing shortages.

Figure 3. COVID Ridership and Platform Hour Impacts

Pre-pandemic, RTD was experiencing minimal ridership growth despite a significant investment in the
region’s rail network. Ridership, and the provision of service (measured as annual service hours) was not
keeping pace with population growth. Rail ridership was growing in conjunction with rail service
expansion. However, bus ridership was declining, while bus service levels remained relatively constant,
thus resulting in a drop in bus service productivity. At the same time, RTD’s operating costs have been
steadily increasing, resulting in an increased cost per passenger trip.

Packet Pg. 19

1.D.4

The pandemic accelerated trends that were already in place. As noted, in response to the pandemic,
RTD scaled service back to better match reduced demand. The 2021 Title VI equity assessment
determined that RTD’s service adjustments were done in a manner that resulted in less impacts to equity
populations than to non-equity populations. As RTD has incrementally returned service, it is finding that
demand is strongest in the higher density corridors with mixed land uses (e.g., Colfax Avenue). Ridership
on commuter-oriented routes has returned at a much slower rate and remains a small fraction of prepandemic ridership. Furthermore, service restoration has been hampered by operator staff shortages,
requiring RTD to be strategic in the prioritization of service restoration.
The SOP design process included development of four distinct alternative scenarios to determine service
priorities in consultation with the TWG, AC and the Board of Directors. The objectives of this process
were to determine how differing investment strategies would influence ridership, cost and efficiency,
and to find an appropriate balance for draft SOP recommendations. The following four scenarios were
defined:
-

Service Quality
Service Productivity
Social Equity
Geographic Coverage

Each scenario includes a consistent network of core routes. These include the RTD rail network, the
Flatiron Flyer BRT service and other highly productive routes or route segments (e.g., Route 15). Core
network routes were generally routes with 25+ passengers per revenue-hour and at least 2,000
passenger trips per day. Consideration was given to route spacing, connectivity to major destinations,
and planned BRT corridors. Approximately 59% of RTD’s bus-hours (pre-COVID) were defined as RTD’s
Core network. The remaining available bus-hours were then incorporated into the design of each service
scenario. Once each scenario network was defined, they were evaluated with a common set of
evaluation metrics, such as ridership, accessibility and cost-effectiveness. Location-Based Services (LBS)
data was used extensively in the development of each scenario. This data tracks actual travel
movements at a block group level. An example use of this data is with the Social Equity scenario, where
areas with high equity populations were identified and LBS travel patterns reviewed from those areas to
determine transit services that best address those travel patterns.
Following are brief descriptions of each scenario that was developed as part of the SOP service design
process. All scenarios were developed within the same annual bus-hour constraint,8 percent below 2019
service hours.
The service quality scenario focused resources on providing very frequent and fast service in transitsupportive corridors. The allocation of service hours is focused on prioritizing improvements to
frequencies, speeds, reliability, span of service, connections and facilities in corridors that have proven
to be transit-supportive. This scenario strives to maintain one-seat rides to ensure travel time
competitiveness. Population and employment density information were key inputs into the development

Packet Pg. 20

1.D.4

of this scenario. Key metrics include the percentage of population served by 15-minute or better service,
and the competitiveness of transit travel times.
The service productivity scenario focused resources on service travel markets that will achieve the
highest potential ridership in a cost-effective manner. Service design tailors service to the travel market,
with less frequent fixed-route service and mobility-on-demand options for geographic areas with low
ridership potential, and additional fixed route services and frequency improvements in geographic areas
with high ridership potential. The review of current ridership productivity metrics was a key input into
the development of this scenario. Key metrics include the cost per boarding and boardings per servicehour.
The social equity scenario focused resources on improving transit to areas with low-income and minority
populations. Service design prioritizes improvements to neighborhoods with high density equity
populations and provides service that best addresses observed travel patterns from those neighborhoods.
The LBS travel pattern data was a key input into the development of this scenario. Key metrics include
the percent of transit-dependent population served, and the percent of transit-dependent population
served with 15-minute or better service.
The geographic coverage scenario focused on spreading service out across the district to maximize
access to District residents. Service design includes new fixed routes to fill-out the network and new
FlexRide areas in low-density portions of the district to maximize service area coverage. This network
strives to provide strong service connectivity between low-density areas of the District and the Core
network. Key metrics include the percent of District population and District employment served.
Each scenario was evaluated with a common set of evaluation metrics to determine service
effectiveness. The metrics focus on accessibility, ridership, costs and travel times. Figure 4 and Figure 5
present evaluation results for the four scenarios. Key findings are as follows.
-

-

-

Service Quality Scenario
o Generates the most daily boardings
o Has the lowest cost per boarding
o Provides the best travel time ratio

Evaluation results from the scenario development exercise were presented to the TWG, AC and the RTD
Board of Directors. There was no specific preferred scenario. Rather, there were elements of each
scenario that stakeholders and the Board of Directors indicated they would like to see reflected in the
SOP. Some key takeaways from these meetings were as follows:

Packet Pg. 22

1.D.4

-

The SOP should reflect strong service to areas with high equity populations, providing transit
services that are designed to address travel needs for those identified communities

-

Service quality is an important characteristic that should be maintained in the SOP for corridors
that have transit-supportive development and consistently exhibit strong ridership

-

Recognizing that fixed route service may not be cost-effective everywhere, alternative service
delivery options such as FlexRide should be sought to maximize geographic coverage to the
extent feasible

Based on the feedback received from the evaluation of the four scenarios, the SOP recommendations
prioritize a regionally focused high-quality transit network that delivers strong connectivity to equity
communities and transit-supportive land use corridors. The network has been developed in a manner that
reflects financial constraints and current travel market demand. To maximize service coverage, the SOP
encourages partnerships with local agencies to bolster local connectivity to the regional transit
network.
A key feature of the SOP is the categorization of routes into a new travel market-based network of
services. This new classification will replace RTD’s current Family of Services classifications. Proposed
new service categories are as follows:

-

Core – These routes serve the region’s largest employment centers, highest density population
areas and major trip generators with a demonstrated demand for a minimum of an 18-hour span
of service, 15-minute or better peak period and midday service frequencies, and service operated
seven days a week

-

Connect – Local routes with a minimum 14-hour span of service (6 am to 8 pm)
Commute – Regional bus routes with a limited stop spacing focused on serving a unique travel
market (e.g., downtown workforce, Denver International Airport workforce and travelers)

-

Community – Community-focused local routes with custom-built span of service, frequency and
days of service to meet local needs. Community routes include both low and high frequency
services (e.g., Mall Shuttle).

The SOP relies on well-defined transit transfer hubs to facilitate connectivity between different route
categories (e.g., Community routes connecting to a Core route). SOP recommendations retain RTD’s
practice of operating at clock-faced headways (e.g., frequencies of 10, 15, 30 and 60 minutes). All
route recommendations were developed with the following key design objectives in mind:

-

Simplification – Provide well-defined corridor routes with minimal deviations from the intended
service corridor

-

Consistency – Minimize irregular trip patterns and provide consistent service spans
Reliability – Break-up long routes to improve transit travel time reliability

The initial draft SOP was presented to RTD Board of Directors through a series of meetings in November
2021 and released to the public in December 2021.

DISCUSSION
In accordance with the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan relating to Community Value, Customer Excellence,
and Financial Success, the proposed System Optimization Plan provides a transit network that best
meets the needs of travelers within the District while staying within the fiscal constraints of the 20222027 Mid-Term Financial Plan.
Initial draft SOP recommendations were presented to the TWG, the AC, and the public in Winter 2022.
Over 1,600 comments, provided in Attachment A, were received and reviewed, resulting in adjustments
to draft SOP recommendations. Those changes impact the following routes:
-

7 – Extend north along Washington Street to serve Denver Premium Outlets
15L – Move western terminal to Union Station to align with future East Colfax BRT plans
24S – Operate on RidgeGate Parkway between Yosemite Street and Park Meadows Boulevard
43 – Move western terminal to Decatur-Federal Station to replace 15L service
52 – Extend service west from Olde Town Arvada Station to serve the Ralston Road corridor to
64th/Ward, replacing some Route 72 service
72 – Move western terminal to Olde Town Arvada Station from 64th/Ward
122X – service is now included, in conjunction with Route 120X
402L – expand service to include weekends
AB2 – peak hour trips previously recommended on Route AB1 are now included as Route AB2
with service at Boulder Junction at Depot Square Station
AT/ATA – continue to provide early morning service
FF2 – Provide bi-directional service during peak periods
LX2 – provide service through Longmont on Route LX2 rather than only on the north side of
Longmont on Route LX1

The majority of comments received on the SOP requested additional service that exceeded the resources
allocated for the SOP. Many of these identified areas will be monitored for consideration of service
increase in future service changes.
The SOP bus network is presented in Figure 6. Individual route “cut” sheets are provided in Attachment
B. The SOP is financially constrained to 85 percent of RTD’s pre-COVID service levels. Earlier in this
report it was noted that RTD’s ridership profile throughout the weekday has “flattened”. SOP service
recommendations capture the need for a more flattened service profile (i.e., less service in the peak
periods and more service in the midday periods). Pre-COVID, RTD’s peak-to-base bus ratio was 1.81
(i.e., there were 1.81 buses operating in the peak period for every bus operating in the midday period).
The SOP’s peak-to-base bus ratio is 1.38. There is also less drastic difference in service-hours between
weekday and weekend service. As an example, pre-pandemic, there were 1.81 weekday bus-hours for
every Saturday bus-hour of service. The SOP reflects a ratio of 1.45. Core bus routes comprise of 41
percent of all bus-hours in the SOP network. As is noted later in this section, there are modest
improvements to overall transit access with the SOP network over Fall 2021 service coverage. However,
access to frequent service (15-minute or better service) is dramatically improved as a result of the
proposed investment in Core bus route service.

Figure 6. Proposed SOP Bus Network

SOP rail recommendations were partially implemented in early 2021 as part of RTD’s efforts to right-size
service to reduced rail passenger demands. Figure 7 presents the proposed light rail network. At the
start of the SOP project effort, RTD operated eight light rail lines (C, D, E, F, H, L, R and W). As part of
this SOP process, it was recommended that C/D service along the Southwest corridor and E/F service
along the Southeast Corridor be consolidated to improve service reliability north of I-25/Broadway
Station, where trains consistently encountered delays because of heavy train traffic (20 train trips per
hour in each direction in the peak periods). The C and F lines can still be put in operation when
warranted for special events.

Figure 7. Proposed SOP Light Rail Network

Presently, every other W Line train turns back at the Federal Center Station. The SOP calls for extending
all weekday service to Jeffco Government Center Station, when possible, within financial and staffing
resources. Subject to additional funding, the ultimate desired light rail plan includes the following
improvements:

-

Improve the D, E and H Lines to 10-minute peak and midday service frequencies
Improve the R Line to 15-minute peak and midday frequencies and extend this line to the
RidgeGate Parkway Station.

The SOP commuter rail network is presented in Figure 8. Presently, RTD operates four commuter rail
lines (A, B, G, and N). Proposed service improvements beyond current (2022) operations are as follows:

-

Improve peak B line frequencies from 60 to 30 minutes
Improve G line frequencies from 30 to 15 minutes

The SOP retains all existing FlexRide zones currently in operation by RTD. It is recognized that additional
FlexRide service and other mobility-on-demand (MOD) services will be needed to provide service in areas
that were not financially feasible within SOP financial constraints. These new services could include:
-

FlexRide service expansion
Micro-mobility partnerships (e.g., Bike-share and Scooter-share)
TNC partnerships (e.g., Lyft, Uber)
Active transportation connectivity (e.g., bike and sidewalk connectivity improvements)

RTD will continue to explore partnership opportunities with local governments regarding MOD service
expansion as part of the SOP.
A comparison was made between RTD’s fall 2021 bus and rail network and the proposed SOP network
to determine the extent to which the SOP improves the region’s accessibility to transit.
-

-

-

General Population Accessibility
• The fall 2021 RTD rail and bus network is estimated to be accessible to 54 percent of the
District population (accessibility defined as being within ¼ mile of bus stops and ½ mile of
rail and premium bus stops). The SOP expands this accessibility slightly to 56 percent of
the District population. However, access to frequent service (defined as 15-minute or
better all-day service) is significantly expanded from 13 percent to 21 percent of the
District population (a 61 percent increase in frequent service accessibility).
Equity Population Accessibility
• The Fall 2021 RTD rail and bus network is estimated to be accessible to 69 percent of the
District’s equity population (minority and/or low-income populations). The SOP expands
this accessibility slightly to 71 percent of the District’s equity population. However, access
to frequent service is significantly expanded from 18 percent to 28 percent of the District
population (a 58 percent increase in frequent service accessibility).
Jobs
• The Fall 2021 RTD rail and bus network is estimated to be accessible to 65 percent of the
District’s employment. The SOP expands this accessibility slightly to 67 percent of the
District’s employment. However, access to frequent service is significantly expanded from
31 percent to 39 percent of the District population (a 26 percent increase in frequent
service accessibility).

Implementation of the SOP network is planned in a phased manner through 2027 as part of regular
service changes which typically occur three times per year. The timing of SOP phased implementation
will depend on the availability of financial resources and agency staffing levels. Sequencing of SOP
service implementation will be based on RTD’s continued monitoring of ridership and maintaining the
integrity of the RTD transit network. Service to equity populations is a priority to RTD, and RTD’s Title
VI requirements will be evaluated and considered when determining SOP phasing sequencing.
Current workforce shortfalls in both rail and bus operations and maintenance staffing remain a challenge
to implementing the SOP. The people power problem that RTD is facing is shared throughout the transit
industry in North America. Efforts to meet the 17% increase in service hours by 2027, as proposed in

Packet Pg. 28

1.D.4

the SOP will require hiring approximately 300 bus and 70 rail operators, at the current attrition rate.
While efforts are being made by both RTD’s Operations department and Human Resources division, the
ability to make more immediate service increases through the SOP will require time, as more employees
join the organization.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The System Optimization Plan cost structure is based on the adopted 2022-2027 Mid-Term Financial
Plan and no financial impact is expected. This service is at approximately 85% of pre-Pandemic service
levels or approximately 17% greater than current service levels.

Seems like this jog (LD1) into downtown Lafayette and then around the Exempla campus takes a lot of time. Why not keep
the bus on 287 and try to better connect residents to the route to improve overall times?

Thank you for your input! The medical campus is a large generator of ridership along US 287, but is far enough from the
highway that a deviation is necessary. Discontinuing it would cut‐off service to a large ridership area that needs service.

Similar to LD1 ‐ Could DASH be kept on S. Boulder instead of jogging into downtown Louisville? Seems like this detour takes
a lot of time.

Thank you for your input! Deviating to serve Downtown Louisville provides much greater access to residents and businesses
than staying on South Boulder Road.

The JUMP service should be fully restored to pre‐COVID levels, with service to Erie and Lafayette. This is the starter service

I really appreciated the reverse‐peak trips on the FF4. I work in Boulder and live in Arvada. I see that it appears the routes

Thank you for your input! Route FF4 is planned for peak‐period, peak‐direction service. RTD will continue monitoring this

While the plan didn't outright say Boulder Jct would reopen, it doesn't say it wouldn't either. What's the plan for it? It will

Thank you for your input! Boulder Junction is planned to reopen with service on Routes FF4 and AB2.

It is not safe to leave your car parked here.

Thank you for your input! The Mobility Guiding Principle for the Reimagine RTD project states that RTD will “Provide safe,
reliable transportation service to improve the quality of life of residents, customers and visitors.” Safety is an inherent
aspect of the SOP because all the SOP recommendations are by definition a reflection of our established safety culture. RTD
feels confident that we are providing transit services safely. Commuter rail, for example, is celebrating 18 months without a
signal violation or accident on the N Line and our bus operators drive in a safe manner, do not exceed speed limits, etc.
However, RTD recognizes recent challenges throughout the system related to security and is working hard to restore a
secure environment for customers, employees, visitors and nearby residents. RTD is implementing a system‐wide plan that
encompasses security topics related to RTD's operations, our passengers, motorists, cyclists and pedestrians.

Restore FF and AB service to Boulder Junction. Significant new employment and residential space is coming soon, plus
service is essential for serving the huge employment areas in East Boulder (which also needs some sort of circulator shuttle
system).

Very happy the GS is returning. IΓÇÖve commuted on this bus and the G before it for more than 30 years.
Limiting bus stops to just this location requires many Lafayette residents to walk more than a mile to get there. Please

driving?
I use the AB1 and FF1 regularly from Tantra and Table Mesa. Back in Tantra Drive we have medium density housing and
minimizing my car travel by using the bus is very important to me and my neighbors.

If you keep either the LX1 or the LX2, keep the LX2. It provides much needed express service from 287/Niwot PnR to
Downtown Denver. It also conveniently services all of Longmont and your LX1 wouldn't. This necessitates transfers for
pretty much all.

I agree 100% with the loss of the LD1. Could the LD3 just be between Longmont and Lafayette, and have the LD1 terminate
in Lafayette?
Somewhere around here would be a better spot for a park 'n' ride rather than on Public Rd where it is now.

Thank you for your input! RTD is not currently planning for a new park n ride facility in this area.

This little hitch oof the 228 off of S. Boulder Rd is completely unnecessary. I get that it used to terminate here so that the
stop is on Garfield, but can't the stop just be moved to S. Boulder Rd?

Thank you for your input! This short deviation is necessary because of a lack of Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
accessible facilities on South Boulder Road in this area. RTD is able to provide accessible stops by using Cottonwood.

I would expect more service to this Depot rather than less. As someone who rides RTD every day not having to fight with
getting downtown or to Table Mesa would be valuable.

Thank you for your input! Once the SOP is implemented, Routes HOP and BOUND will continue to serve the area and Routes

encompasses security topics related to RTD's operations, our passengers, motorists, cyclists and pedestrians.

More bus routes to Boulder Junction, please! Our office is opening this summer, and we have many commuters coming in
from Denver, Longmont, Louisville, Lafayette, and Erie.

Thank you for your input! Ridership at Boulder Junction Station was taken into consideration when defining the SOP and
balancing transit needs elsewhere in Boulder. The SOP does restore the FF4 and the HOP and Bound will continue as they
are operating today near this station. In response to other comments received, the SOP was modified to include Route AB2
service to Boulder Junction. Other routes were not generating much ridership at Boulder Junction previously. For example,
Routes 236 and 206 generated 85 and 17 boardings/day at Boulder Junction, respectively, and Route 236 was discontinued
prior to the pandemic due to lower ridership.

The AB route should run more frequently. Buses are often over crowded. Additionally, more frequent service would make
the bus more dependable and encourage more riders.

Thank you for your input! RTD will continue monitoring this route to determine if service enhancements should be

Make the 38 go down Park Ave. ‐ many potential transfer points with the 20 and 15. For that matter, have it connect with
the 41st and Fox station to still allow for transfers to Downtown.

Thank you for your input! While Downtown is slightly out of direction on this route, it is still the main destination for
passengers. Bypassing Downtown would force a transfer the majority of passengers and require additional resources on the
connecting routes for more capacity. If you would like to transfer, it is a short walk to 41st & Fox.

Thank you for your input! Route 7 will include an additional pattern to connect to the area of the Denver Premium Outlets.

Eliminate the separate 120L/520 routes. It adds ~15 minutes to the trip each direction due to the mid‐route layover.

Thank you for your input! The SOP did not include this change because it would negatively impact RTD's current workforce
challenges. While it may be possible to shorten the layover at US85/Bridge St. Park‐n‐Ride for trips interlined, an evaluation
will have to be conducted to ensure that it would not result in breaking other connections or shortening our required
layover/recovery time for this route.

I don't understand how cutting midday service on Route 43 supports the equity goal, when Route 43 serves historically
disadvantaged communities, who are less likely to have jobs with a regular Monday‐Friday 9‐5 schedule.

Thank you for your input! RTD conducted a federally‐required Title VI analysis on the SOP that determined low‐income
routes are allocated almost 12% more trips compared to higher‐income routes, and minority routes are allocated almost
13% more trips than non‐minority routes. In addition to the federally‐required Title VI analysis, the SOP was developed to
meet the existing travel needs of as many members of equity communities (i.e., low‐income, and minority) and/or zero car
households as possible. To do this, the SOP focused on providing high frequency service to those areas where the highest
concentrations of equity community members live or work. As compared to September, 2021, the SOP results in a 50%
increase in access to 15‐minute or better service for equity community members throughout the District. The SOP also
works to balance services in areas with a high‐density of equity community members with providing connecting service to
less‐dense equity community members in the suburbs as much as possible.

I've had my vehicle stolen here. Increased surveillance or deterrent would be helpful for RTD usages here and at other
park&ride stations. I appreciate the service still, though!

Thank you for your input! The Mobility Guiding Principle for the Reimagine RTD project states that RTD will “Provide safe,
reliable transportation service to improve the quality of life of residents, customers and visitors.” Safety is an inherent
aspect of the SOP because all the SOP recommendations are by definition a reflection of our established safety culture. RTD
feels confident that we are providing transit services safely. Commuter rail, for example, is celebrating 18 months without a
signal violation or accident on the N Line and our bus operators drive in a safe manner, do not exceed speed limits, etc.
However, RTD recognizes recent challenges throughout the system related to security and is working hard to restore a
secure environment for customers, employees, visitors and nearby residents. RTD is implementing a system‐wide plan that
encompasses security topics related to RTD's operations, our passengers, motorists, cyclists and pedestrians.

I've never understood this routing away from Sheridan for the 51. could it be eliminated to decrease overall travel time? If
access to the shops along 44th is the concern, time transfers with the 44.

Thank you for your input! There are poor pedestrian connections on Sheridan in this area and more transit supportive land
uses along Harlan, so the SOP determined that it made the most sense for this route to continue to use Harlan between
44th and 48th.

I assume these routing patterns are wrong as your plans indicate the 38 and 44 going to the G line. However, I'm curious of
the proposed routes to the G line, in case they differ from current due to future development in the TOD area.

Thank you for your input! Routes 38 and 44 do terminate at the Wheat Ridge ‐ Ward G Line Station. There are no other
changes planned for this area.

Could local routes be timed appropriately to the FF, especially on Sundays with the 30‐60 minute headways with the routes.

Thank you for your input! RTD does its best to make transfers as easy and fast as possible but competing transfers along the
length of a route make some transfers less convenient than others.

I wish RTD could bring back the 122X ‐ using the 120X and Free MetroRide (once it's restored) takes 10 minutes longer to

Thank you for your input! Based on feedback from stakeholders and the public, the SOP was modified to include Route
122X in addition to Route 120X. In peak periods, Route 120X will operate every 15 minutes and Route 122X will operate
every 30 minutes for a combined service every 10 minutes along North I‐25. Implementation of SOP service improvements

Elimination of the 128 will leave people with no non‐drive option to get to light rail or any park‐n‐Ride. Why not just
connect Broomfield pnR to LRT station at 124th/York?

Thank you for your input! Pre‐pandemic ridership on Route 128 was consistently low ‐ averaging approximately 11 riders
per hour in total. Reinstating Route 128 service to pre‐pandemic levels would add about 8,200 revenue hours and cost
about $1 million per year, and expanding evening and weekend service would increase operating costs even more. These
additional costs would need to be offset elsewhere in the network in order for the SOP to meet RTD's existing financial and
workforce constraints. RTD is committed to monitoring existing FlexRide services to determine the impacts from this route
change and to address future demand if needs along this corridor change.
Thank you for your input! Based on feedback from stakeholders and the public, the SOP was modified to include Route

Billing, DMV, Community Center, Courthouse and Police Station is proposed to be eliminated (128).

Thank you for your input! Pre‐pandemic ridership on Route 128 was consistently low ‐ averaging approximately 11 riders
per hour in total. Reinstating Route 128 service to pre‐pandemic levels would add about 8,200 revenue hours and cost
about $1 million per year, and expanding evening and weekend service would increase operating costs even more. These
additional costs would need to be offset elsewhere in the network in order for the SOP to meet RTD's existing financial and
workforce constraints. RTD is committed to monitoring existing FlexRide services to determine the impacts from this route
change and to address future demand if needs along this corridor change.

The bus stop near 120th and Main serves A Precious Child (a non‐profit org. supporting children & their families) that it is a

Thank you for your input! The Mobility Guiding Principle for the Reimagine RTD project states that RTD will “Provide safe,
reliable transportation service to improve the quality of life of residents, customers and visitors.” Safety is an inherent
aspect of the SOP because all the SOP recommendations are by definition a reflection of our established safety culture. RTD
feels confident that we are providing transit services safely. Commuter rail, for example, is celebrating 18 months without a
signal violation or accident on the N Line and our bus operators drive in a safe manner, do not exceed speed limits, etc.
However, RTD recognizes recent challenges throughout the system related to security and is working hard to restore a
secure environment for customers, employees, visitors and nearby residents. RTD is implementing a system‐wide plan that
encompasses security topics related to RTD's operations, our passengers, motorists, cyclists and pedestrians.

This plan increases the number of transfers I have to make to reach my destination.

Thank you for your input! The SOP is designed to include a network of core routes that serve high density corridors and to
provide convenient connections to key destinations in the region with frequent and reliable service. While additional
transfers may be required for some travel movements, the SOP incorporates additional features to facilitate timely transfers
such as holding the D & E lines at I‐25 to account for one‐seat ride that was eliminated with the C and F line.

Hwy 7 Boulder ‐ Brighton is a core commute route that can't handle the existing traffic. RTD needs to prioritize adding bus
service to this road.

Thank you for your input! In developing the SOP, an extensive library of relevant local and regional plans was compiled and
reviewed, and aspects that best supported the SOP Guiding Principles and existing travel needs were incorporated. The SOP
took these plans into consideration as much as possible, but existing financial and workforce constraints, and the need to
best meet the existing travel needs of the region were limiting factors. Due to the impacts of the COVID‐19 pandemic, the
SOP will act as a new baseline for providing service within RTD's financial and workforce constraints through 2027. These
existing constraints do not provide the capacity needed to add additional new transit services in the short‐term. Future
growth and development throughout the region will be addressed as part of the Mobility Plan for the Future, the

I am opposed to no longer running the 402L on weekends. I have talked to bus drivers on this route and they indicated to
me that the highest ridership on this route is on the weekend. Why is RTD continually cutting service to Highlands.

The 1 shouldn't go downtown, it should go through the 10 or 6, both avoiding downtown. Example:
https://i.imgur.com/WTMM6Tb.png (other routes are possible). Too many potential transfers via 15L and LRT to justify
direct downtown connections.
I agree that the 99 and 100 could be increased to 30 minute service. Perhaps Jefferson county could help fund this and
make it a semi‐community route?
16 takes too long to go around the the LRT station. Can some not stop here? Or at a minimum have the WB 16 go south on
Federal, turn west on Howard Pl., stop, then continue to Colfax. Reverse for EB.

I like what's proposed for the 1 route.
NOT a fan of what's proposed for the 9 route! It's already weird and squiggly and slow, but even as is it's one of the only
ways to take the transit from downtown Denver into downtown Lakewood. Keep the route as is, don't truncate it at a rail
station.
The proposed change to the 9 renders it completely unnecessary; why would someone take a bus from one rail stop to
another when they could just take the rail? Keep this route into downtown Denver please!!

Thank you for your input! Route 16 will continue to serve Downtown Golden from Oak Station and the Golden FlexRide will

I appreciate the W‐Line having 15 minute frequency. The key to increasing ridership is SAFETY at the Sheridan Station and

Thank you for your input! The Mobility Guiding Principle for the Reimagine RTD project states that RTD will “Provide safe,
reliable transportation service to improve the quality of life of residents, customers and visitors.” Safety is an inherent
aspect of the SOP because all the SOP recommendations are by definition a reflection of our established safety culture. RTD
feels confident that we are providing transit services safely. Commuter rail, for example, is celebrating 18 months without a
signal violation or accident on the N Line and our bus operators drive in a safe manner, do not exceed speed limits, etc.
However, RTD recognizes recent challenges throughout the system related to security and is working hard to restore a
secure environment for customers, employees, visitors and nearby residents. RTD is implementing a system‐wide plan that
encompasses security topics related to RTD's operations, our passengers, motorists, cyclists and pedestrians.

Please make the timing of the 51 line up with the W Line. We often bike from Alameda to the W Line because the bus is
often late and we get left at the train stop. Some safety / enforcement would be nice too. It's scary to wait here.

Thank you for your input! RTD strives to make connections as convenient as possible but it is not always feasible with
competing connections along a route. The Mobility Guiding Principle for the Reimagine RTD project states that RTD will
“Provide safe, reliable transportation service to improve the quality of life of residents, customers and visitors.” Safety is an
inherent aspect of the SOP because all the SOP recommendations are by definition a reflection of our established safety
culture. RTD feels confident that we are providing transit services safely. Commuter rail, for example, is celebrating 18
months without a signal violation or accident on the N Line and our bus operators drive in a safe manner, do not exceed
speed limits, etc. However, RTD recognizes recent challenges throughout the system related to security and is working hard
to restore a secure environment for customers, employees, visitors and nearby residents. RTD is implementing a system‐
wide plan that encompasses security topics related to RTD's operations, our passengers, motorists, cyclists and pedestrians.

This bus stop could be much more useful if there was a safe location to access it from the west side. We find ourselves
running across Sheridan Blvd to get to the stop. Weir Gulch trail could use a tunnel across.

Thank you for your input! RTD strives to place stops in safe locations, but if safe crossings at signals are few and far
between, then the municipality (the city of Denver or Lakewood in this case) will need to make the needed improvements.

Been left by the bus after the train was 30 seconds late here. Had to wait an additional 30 minutes. I stopped taking the
bus because of this.
I've been kicked off the bus due to having a bicycle at this location. The operator said he was full, but seemed to have
plenty of room. I was stranded.
Can there be a rear bike rack or an additional rack somewhere near bike trails.

This reduction of Route 209, along with the discontinuation of the 236, J, AB2, and the FF6, decreases transit service and options for
CU’s growing East Campus (daytime population of 6,000 students and staff) and is of concern to the City of Boulder and CU‐Boulder.
We request that the SOP revisit transit options to enhance coverage and service options to CU‐Boulder’s East Campus.

Thank you for your input! Prior to the pandemic, Route 209 carried 319 passengers per day. Today, CU‐Boulder is running a shuttle
service between their East and Main campuses that provides a duplicative service to Route 209. The SOP also includes one pattern of
the BOLT that provides service to East Campus. RTD will continue monitoring this area to determine if service enhancements should be
considered in the future. Future changes will be evaluated as part of RTD's existing three‐times‐per‐year service change process.

Can you expand on the East‐West route through Boulder – why was the bifurcation of the route moved from the Jump to the 225 route?

Lafayette to meet changes in demographics and travel patterns and to serve the new Willoughby low‐income housing complex. This

Upon the City of Longmont’s completion of a signal at SH 66 & Alpine, we request a minor alignment change to keep the current Pace St
routing north of 17th, with routing along Olympia Ave to Alpine St, then to the future signal at SH 66. This change would eliminate the
proposed routing on 17th Ave west of Pace St and on the diagonal segment of Alpine St, which would be duplicative of 327 service.
In the interim, we request a rou ng through the exis ng signal at SH 66 & Pace.

Thank you for your input! Once the new signal at SH 66 and Alpine is complete, RTD will look to make the alignment change requested.
Future changes will be implemented as part of RTD's existing three‐times‐per‐year service change process. Routing on 17th to Alpine
has previously been reviewed with Longmont staff and is consistent with their feedback. The SOP reflects the eventual alignment
adjustment to SH 66 and Alpine once a new traffic signal is in place. Until then routing will remain on Pace Street.

Please incorporate the new 1st & Main Infrastructure Master Plan (IMP) concepts with the bus station accessing Coffman Street

We are very appreciative of the continued increase in frequency on route AB in the weekday peak periods and weekend evening
periods, however we are requesting that these additional trips (on top of the hourly headways on the AB1) be restored as AB2 trips,
with service to and from Boulder Junction Station. There are roughly 4,000 CU students who live within walking distance of AB2 stops
on 28thSt, not to mention the non‐CU market that would also benefit from increased access to the airport service.

Thank you for your input! Several of the SOP changes in Boulder, including restoring service to Boulder Junction, have helped to
addressed many of RTD's pre‐pandemic layover capacity challenges.

We appreciate and support that the proposed DASH routing includes service to the Willoughby Corner BCHA development in east
Lafayette.

Thank you for your input! RTD exists because of people like you!

FF5: We support the SOP proposal for peak‐direction service to Anschutz, but wonder if that creates a lot of deadheading for the FF5,
and if those deadheads could be put into revenue service to make the FF5 bi‐directional instead.

Thank you for your input! For the FF5, deadheading is not a critical concern because the single direction travel allows the bus to
continue service as another route.

We would like confirmation that with the restoration of the FF4, the Boulder Junction Station would be re‐opened to the public.

Thank you for your input! Yes, Boulder Junction will be re‐opened to the public with the restoration of the FF4.

FF1: We request that the FF1 service on Fridays and Saturdays be extended to 2:30am, later than the currently proposed 12:30am. As
nightlife resumes, having a safe late‐night travel option between Boulder and Denver is a safety issue, and pre‐pandemic, these trips
were often quite full.

Thank you for your input! RTD will continue monitoring late‐night trips on this route to determine if service enhancements should be
considered in the future due to changes in travel demand or land usage. Future changes will be evaluated as part of RTD's existing three‐

Thank you for your input! Based on travel demand, it was determined in the SOP that bi‐directional service should be considered on the
FF2 prior to bi‐directional service on FF4. Making this adjustment to the FF4 is also estimated to add $600,000 to O&M costs. However,

We acknowledge that the 205T had low pre‐pandemic ridership and agree that the outlying portions of Gunbarrel and Heatherwood
would be more effectively served by an on‐demand transit option (instead of fixed route). We therefore support the proposal to

Comment
Route 326 was just changed to 30‐minute headways; we request that this improvement be retained in the SOP.
We support the proposed alignment change for 21st Ave, but request that the existing routing on Longs Peak Ave be maintained. While
this would preclude the 326 from serving the 8th Ave stop on Coffman, there would be several other transfer opportunities to other
routes on Coffman between Longs Peak and 1st. However, the routing change is far less important to us than the headways, and
depending on public input, the proposed rou ng on 9th may be fine.
We like how the plan for the BOLT builds on the SH 119 BRT work that has been completed, and includes both the Blue Line and Orange
Line future BRT patterns
We would like to see bi‐directional service included in the SOP for the Orange Line (west Longmont to CU‐Boulder) and request the
opportunity to have additional conversations with all stakeholders about the Orange Line’s Boulder terminus. In particular, layover
challenges would need to be addressed with CU‐Boulder for a Main Campus terminus.
FF3: While this route does not operate in Boulder County, we would like RTD to explore interlining some FF3 trips with the LD/LBr
service (see LD/LBr route for more details on this request).

Response
Thank you for your input! The SOP adjusts Route 326's frequency to be consistent with the Longmont Local Bus Routes Network plan.
Based on our analysis, adding additional frequency on Route 326 was weighed against new service and frequency on the proposed
Route 328. The local bus network was discussed with Longmont staff and the network included in the SOP reflects the feedback
received. Additionally, Longs Peak is only two blocks from 9th Avenue and the proposed alignment reduces bus turning movements
which in turn will improve bus speeds.
Thank you for your input! Based on feedback received from stakeholders, the SOP was revised to include bi‐directional service for the
Orange Line. However, there are significant challenges with adding a terminal to CU's main campus, including the need to make
intersection improvements, etc. CU has indicated an interest in having this route connect to East Campus and plans to use the
Stampede to move students to the main campus. Duplicating this service would require additional vehicles and would increase
operating costs.
Thank you for your input! This routing option is something that can be evaluated further closer to implementation so that scheduling,
vehicle needs, etc. can be taken into consideration.

What analysis has been done to determine the gap between the SOP levels of service and levels of service needed to help DRCOG meet
its GHG budgets under CDOT’s new GHG Reduction Planning Standard, and how much additional funding and resources would be
required to provide the service to close that gap? For example, it is our understanding that the GHG modelling assumes an annual 6%
increase in transit service hours, but the SOP only restores service levels to 85% of 2019 levels by 2027.

As the SOP proposes to discontinue the existing service classes (cbd local, urban local, suburban local, regional, etc.) that RTD uses to
allocate service hours, we are very interested in the metrics that will be used to evaluate the new Core, Connect, Commute and
Community service classes. We request the opportunity to participate in the development of service standards for the new service
classes.
Can you weigh in on whether it would be possible for current route service schedules to be added to the map (route attachment

I super appreciate the drivers for a good job of driving.
I do have concerns:
Concern # 1 The cost economically to RTD and the cost to the Earth of running the Big Regional buses on this route in off‐season April
through October.
a) Since Covid, the ridership is way down as you likely know. It is slowly rising in numbers, however, we are not likely very soon to get

smaller vehicle that could operate along the route given the potential adverse weather conditions.
Concern #2 Using Saturday schedule only for M to F
a) The 3:10 pm bus is not needed in off‐season and is a waste of fuel to run.
b) Please do a survey of the ridership and consider altering the schedule to better serve riders actual life schedules, work especially.
For example:
2:10, 4:10, 5:15, 6:45, 8:15 and 10 (the 10:50 is way too late!)
Concern #3 Please remove: The interior stop announcement with the added "Please use the rear exit unless you need the ramp"
Your ITT department can find a way to take this off the regional buses which don't have a rear exit. It is irritating to hear that over and

Further, reopening the Boulder Junction Transit Center and restoring service would align with RTD’s goals to:1. “Reduce RTD’s
environmental impact through provision of sustainable mobility options.”• As BJAD employees return to work in the district, they are
likely to return to environmentally unsustainable commute patterns unless provided with a viable alternative.2. “Serve social equity
communities and transit supportive land uses.”• Approximately 30% of BJAD employees are essential workers, having worked in‐person
through various levels of pandemic restrictions, and BJAD also has a significant amount of affordable housing.

Other routes were not generating much ridership at Boulder Junction previously. For example, Routes 236 and 206 generated 85 and

We would like confirmation that, with restoration of the FF4 route, the Boulder Junction Transit Center would be re‐opened to the
public. We would also like to know when this will occur.• In 2019, RTD operated five (5) bus routes out of Boulder Junc on (FF4, FF6,
AB2, 206, and 236). Currently RTD’s 5‐year SOP only includes plans to restore the FF4 route with limited service. The proposed
significant long‐term reduction in transit service at Boulder Junction is of serious concern to us, as it will have significant detrimental

We share this memorandum as feedback regarding the proposed level of service at Boulder Junction Access District (BJAD) in the draft
of RTD’s 5‐year System Optimization Plan (SOP).While our community recognizes there was a reduction in transit ridership during the
peak of the COVID‐19 pandemic, necessitating a reduction in RTD services at that time, we are concerned with the prospect of
continued low levels of service and continued reductions. If viable local and regional transit options are not in place as employees return
to the workplace this year, they will establish single occupant vehicle (SOV)‐dependent commute patterns which would be detrimental

the Boulder Junction Access District, as their home. All of these individuals and families would benefit from reopening the Boulder
Junction Transit Center and full restoration of transit service. Cleary, given these demographics, lack of transit service at the Boulder
Junction Transit Center will have significant negative impacts on the businesses, employees, and residents of the Boulder Junction
Access District. In addition, Boulder Junction Access District property owners pay an ongoing special district tax that generates funding
to provide everyone that lives and works within the district an RTD EcoPass. For these people to be denied sufficient RTD transit service,
despite the district tax being paid, is to further disenfranchise them.
NB Route Specific Comments:
1.We support the con nua on of the route NB as it exists today. However, we would like to bring the following opera onal
considerations to your attention:
During a typical operational year, Eldora Mountain Resort spends approximately $60,000 purchasing regional RTD tickets, for
complimentary tickets, to hand out to skier guests and employees.
Through an agreement with Boulder County (Docket SU‐19‐0006 attached), Eldora Mountain Resort has agreed to incentivize
employees and guests to ride the RTD, to the ski resort, by providing free bus tickets and paying employees for commute time on the
RTD on the weekends.
2.There has been no communica on with Eldora Mountain Resort about entering into a cost sharing agreement. However, in this
regard, we would like to bring the following financial considerations to your attention:
a.With our current level of commitment to purchasing $60,000 ckets over a 6‐month span, to distribute to the public and guests, we
are already providing cost sharing service to the mountain.
b.We have increased ridership to the mountain significantly over the last 5 years. (please refer to the a ached most recent run board
numbers.) Please note that the vast majority of ridership on Route NB occurs to Eldora Mountain Resort.
c.We request an easier system to purchase the volume of ckets other than what we have by purchasing ckets via the
window/Customer Service, at the Downtown Boulder Station.
i.We have inquired with RTD about using a RFID account or barcodes to charge Eldora monthly or buy in‐ bulk and have not had more
efficient options available. This technology is being used in Utah through their transit authority where riders can ride for free with a
season ski pass or IKON pass. (https://www.rideuta.com/Rider‐lnfo/Ski‐Service) We encourage RTD to make this a priority for
Reimagining RTD and aligns with the goal to increase efficiency and optimize the use oftl1e transit network.
11. Due to staffing shortages, it has been a problem getting someone to buy the ticket books each week via the window/customer
service at the Downtown Boulder station as well as have staff at the NB gate to hand out tickets

media.

Thank you for your input! We understand the preference for direct service that does not include a transfer. However, the SOP is
designed to include a network of core routes that serve high density corridors and to provide convenient connections to key
destinations in the region with frequent and reliable service. In this instance, the SOP proposes all‐day service on SH 287 with a new
route LBr (Longmont‐Broomfield), with transfers to expanded Flatiron Flyer service.

Prior to the Covid‐19 pandemic and even more so now, RTD is failing to provide a basic level of service to residents of Longmont. With a
return to its previous service, RTD should focus on improving its intercity services. There are no real reasons why RTD cannot restore

and scaled back regional service. Incidentally, Longmont balances RTD’s grant‐funding needs to serve lower‐income communities yet

How have the LD 1 and the LBR changed – the ones that stay on 287? The SOP only includes the LBR between Broomfield and
Longmont. The LD 1 turns into the LBR (consolidates service on the 287 corridor). So there will be no one‐seat ride between Lafayette’s
and DUS?

Thank you for your input! Yes, the SOP does not include a one‐seat ride from Lafayette to DUS. The SOP was updated to have a

The SOP is a major initiative, and we commend RTD for taking a critical look at improving the attractiveness and effectiveness of its bus
services. The SOP also has significant considerations and implications, as this will guide the service plan and levels for the next five years
through 2027 and beyond. In reviewing the draft SOP materials, we are concerned that the SOP development and approval process is
highly condensed and that there is not adequate time and channels available for comprehensive and meaningful public and rider input
considering the significance of this plan. Accessing, understanding, and commenting on the SOP materials is difficult and requires
computer literacy to navigate and find on the RTD website. For example, the one‐page route proposals are not available on the primary

are low‐income, and 53% work in essential jobs. Furthermore, reducing service on the JUMP conflicts with collaborative
regional efforts underway to fund and launch CO‐7 BRT services on Arapahoe Avenue. This is also contrary to the SOP
proposal to bolster BOLT service on CO‐119 in preparation of funding and launching BRT services. We request that the SOP
proposal for JUMP services be revisited and improved to better serve this important transit corridor and to continue
momentum for planned CO‐7 BRT services.

Thank you for your input! RTD will continue monitoring this route to determine if service enhancements should be considered in the
future due to changes in travel demand or land usage. Future changes will be evaluated as part of RTD's existing three‐times‐per‐year
service change process. In developing the SOP, an extensive library of relevant local and regional plans was compiled and reviewed, and
aspects that best supported the SOP Guiding Principles and existing travel needs were incorporated. The SOP took these plans into
consideration as much as possible, but existing financial and workforce constraints, and the need to best meet the existing travel needs
of the region were limiting factors. Due to the impacts of the COVID‐19 pandemic, the SOP will act as a new baseline for providing
service within RTD's financial and workforce constraints through 2027. These existing constraints do not provide the capacity needed to
add additional new transit services in the short‐term. Future growth and development throughout the region will be addressed as part
of the Mobility Plan for the Future, the component of Reimagine RTD that is focused on long‐term planning for RTD.

Thank you for your input! The SOP is focused on best meeting the existing travel needs of the District by restoring service to corridors
that exhibit high ridership and serving equity communities that rely on transit to meet their transportation needs. RTD will continue
monitoring these routes to determine if service enhancements should be considered in the future due to changes in travel demand or
land usage. Future changes will be evaluated as part of RTD's existing three‐times‐per‐year service change process.

CU Boulder features a student body of 35,000 and faculty and staff of 10,000, all with Eco Passes paid by the university. Attractive and
effective transit options are critical to moving CU students, faculty, and staff to and from its Main and East Campuses and supporting its
numerous activity generators. CU’s Main and East Campuses are concentrated, walkable areas with limited parking and great transit
markets. Both campuses saw significant transit service reductions with the RTD COVID‐19 Service Plan, and the draft SOP does not fully
restore or significantly enhance services in campus areas impacted by the pandemic service reductions. Prior to the pandemic, CU’s East
Campus was previously served by five (5) RTD routes (Routes 209, J, FF6, JUMP, and BOUND). All but the JUMP and BOUND have been
suspended with the RTD COVID‐19 Service Plan. The draft SOP recommends only the BOUND, a diminished JUMP, and an expanded
BOLT route to serve East Campus. Critical Flatiron Flyer 6 service to Denver and Route 209 connections to campus neighborhoods are
planned for discontinuation. Service to the east side of CU’s Main Campus via 28th Street/US 36 remains suspended due to the COVID‐
19 Service Plan. Routes FF4, FF6, AB2, and 236 operating out of Boulder Junction previously provided service along this important
gateway to CU’s Main Campus, and only the FF4 with reduced services is planned to return to this corridor per the SOP
recommendations. We request SOP efforts to holistically revisit service options to CU’s Main and East Campuses with these concerns in
mind. Similar requested efforts around revisiting service options at Boulder Junction may also identify efficient and attractive options
for improved connections that serve both CU campuses and Boulder Junction.

I have been a customer since 2018 and enjoy taking public transit whenever possible. I am writing to express concern over the drastic
proposed cuts to Longmont regional bus service. Despite rapid population growth, and a high level of transit dependent and
economically vulnerable residents, it appears RTD wants to reduce Longmont's regional services to well below 2019 levels.
I urge RTD to restore all‐day express bus service to Denver along I‐25, and the J to East Boulder along Hover. The BOLT must remain on
Main St in order to support US 287 as a viable transit route. I would be far less likely to take the BOLT on Hover St, as it is in no way
walkable from my house, and is farther from high‐density housing.

Thank you for your input! The FF4 is included in the SOP with service to Civic Center Station. Implementation of SOP service
improvements will occur as financial and workforce resources allow through RTD's existing three‐times‐per‐year service change process.
The entire SOP is planned to be implemented no later than 2027.
Thank you for your input! The SOP is focused on meeting the existing travel needs of as many people in the District as possible by
balancing the need to restore service to corridors that exhibit high ridership with the need to connect less densely populated areas so
that riders can travel throughout the District. As the SOP was developed, scenarios were evaluated that focused more on geographic
coverage. However, it was determined that focusing more on geographic coverage resulted in a 12% decrease in ridership and a 17%
increase in cost per boarding vs. the SOP that works to balance the needs of the more densely populated core with the needs of our
suburban populations. The SOP does provide a 57% increase in access to 15‐minute or better service throughout the District.

Thank you for your input! Several improvements are identified for Longmont as part of the SOP. First, the BOLT will continue to operate
on Main Street. One pattern of the BOLT will also operate on Hover, but just during the peak periods. The J has been folded into BOLT
service, per the SH 119 corridor study that was conducted a few years ago. The LX will also be restored.

Reducing regional service by the proposed extremes will harm Longmont's economic productivity, mobility for disabled residents, and
lead to further auto‐dependent sprawl in the area.

Thank you for your input! The SOP does reflect restoration of many routes such as the LX, and service improvements to existing routes,
such as the BOLT. In anticipation of service adjustments, RTD regularly partners with local government agencies, conducts public
meetings, provides updated information on buses, trains and at stations and updates RTD's website to let the public know of planned
service changes. Once changes go into effect, RTD posts the information on their website, vehicles and social media platforms. RTD also
encourages customers to subscribe to Service Alerts where this information is shared.

You must restore service that has been cut. I live in Longmont. Direct express routes must be restored. You also need to let the voters

I am writing in regards to your ongoing discussions about RTD services. I live in Louisville and voted for the Northwest Commuter Rail.
Thanks in no small part to Boulder County residents, that RTD taxing plan passed and was implemented. Since then, we have been
paying for a rail line that we have not gotten. Everything about RTD’s handling of this issue has been wrong and needs to be corrected.
First, we voted for it.
Next, we have been paying for it.
Finally, we will be forced to continue paying for it.
Most important of all, WE WOULD USE IT far more than those areas that got light rail even though they have a history of voting against
such public transportation and of not using public transportation to anywhere near the extent that Boulder County residents do. So

exponentially less. My own personal experience bears this out. Literally EVERY single time I have ridden the bus from Louisville to
Denver or the airport, the buses have been at LEAST 90% full. Numerous times there was standing room only including airport and
Denver rides where every seat was filled and the entire center aisle was cram packed full of people standing from the very back of the
bus up to the front. When they got to the Broomfield stop, they could only let a couple of the dozen people on, and that was only
because a couple people got off there. The commuter rail would get even more ridership between Boulder & Denver.

other expansion plan and put the Northwest Commuter Rail as your #1 priority. You got our votes, you got our money, you have our

back in person, we need the FF2 between Denver and Boulder back. The FF1 is crowded and many times the bus just skips over stops
because they cannot pick people up. This is unacceptable and makes public transportation more of a hassle than convenience. The FF2
is only necessary during peak hours like it was pre pandemic, and I believe as commuters we need this option to mitigate the horrible
overcrowding on the buses during these morning and evening commuting hours. It’s long overdue to bring this route back.

I have been happy and loyal user of weekday service from south Longmont for almost a decade. The LX2 that ran on Hwy52 to I‐25 was
a fantastic route for me.
I understand that public transportation had to change with COVID‐19's arrival.
What has been created is, in my case, barely usable. Getting to Union Station is my goal, both at the beginning of my RTD commute and
at the end of my work day. I work south of downtown, and the 0 is unreliable. I have other methods of getting to Union Station, so
that's not a huge issue.
My biggest obstacle is the timing of routes back to Longmont. I cannot reach Union Station to catch the last LD1 at 5:23pm. That would
be optimal. (In one case in January, though, I was on time and no driver was available. That was no announcement at Union Station,
unfortunately, to any of the people standing there for an hour.) Instead of the LD1, I grab an FF1 route to Broomfield or Boulder. The
FF1 provides great flexibility. But that's where my evenings get difficult. If I don't somehow reach Broomfield's station by 5:38, I have to
wait for the LD3 to leave almost an hour and a half later. If I go into Boulder's Walnut station to take the BOLT, I'm waiting close to half
an hour for the 7:07 ride.
In those last two scenarios, which I've experienced multiple times in the last six months, my commute home lasts between two hours,
45 minutes and three hours, 15 minutes from the time I leave my office building.
That is entirely unacceptable to me. It's stressful.
I'm currently driving to Broomfield station for my commute. Still paying $5 per trip for half the ride.
Solution: please adjust the last LD1 leaving Union Station to 6pm, or add another bus to the route. Or, have an LD3 that leaves
Broomfield Station at about 6:15.
I am curious to see the schedule for the LBr that you have proposed. I assume that is the current LD3 route.

If we can’t have train service, then we should have great bus service. The FF works. It’s not ideal in the long run maybe we get a train,

Most routes are on 30 minute intervals. Many routes end up going on the same or similar path (especially through downtown). Many
of these that run the same or similar path are scheduled at the same time so they just follow each other and don't allow for access at all times.
The 0 and 15 have the same scheduled times at most downtown stops and the 10 is 4 minutes from them. That leaves about a 26 minute wait

Reinstate AB route service from Broomfield Station to DIA...
For the first few years that my wife and I lived in the "Broomfield Urban Transit Village", getting to and from Denver International
Airport was easy and efficient. Alas, RTD chose to change the route such that it takes the Northwest Parkway from Flatirons Station. I
understand the desire to avoid the perpetual traffic jam at US 36/I‐25/I‐270, but the route now leaves thousands of people living in
Broomfield and northern Westminster with few alternatives to driving to DIA. So, here's a suggestion...
Redesign the AB route to serve Broomfield Station, then proceed north on US 287 to the intersection with Northwest Parkway at Dillon
Road. Going that way adds less than a mile to the total distance, and would likely increase ridership to DUS significantly.

Thank you for your input! In evaluating this proposed realignment it was determined that taking the FF1 to Denver Union Station and
then taking the A line to the airport would provide a faster route.

I’m not savvy enough to figure out how to leave a comment on the website, though I’m able to see them. I’d like to STRONGLY
recommend that there is resumed service between Longmont and Denver. Most of the time, the 5:30 AM LD is cancelled, and some of
the time, the BOLT to Boulder is cancelled. Of course ridership is down ‐ we can’t rely on getting to Denver/home on RTD, even though
we pay into the Eco pass and have been paying into the light rail for years. Being car free in Longmont and having to get to DIA?
HOURS!!!! I LOVE my Eco pass, but the value of it is worth the card it’s on if I’m stuck in Denver at Union station, which is a whole other
issue . . .
Hi, I'm commenting on the RTD draft plan, especially in regard to the lack of coverage in Broomfield. In reviewing your plan, I see there
is no planned transit along Baseline or in North Broomfield, no Flatiron Flyer (FF) to Boulder, no Route 128 on Midway Blvd. We need
more coverage, not less!!!!! We have more and more people in need of public transportation in all parts of Broomfield. Please revise
your plan to offer more robust service here, not less!

Thank you for your input! RTD is working to increase the size of our workforce so that in the future we can provide more reliable
service. The SOP does restore the LX that provides direct service from Longmont to Denver.

Hi Community This Is Anakin And I Was Wondering If You Guys Can Extend The 12 To Oxford Station And The 51 To Oxford Station Also

Thank you for your input! The SOP Route 12 includes a connection to Englewood Station in response to the larger travel market. RTD
will continue monitoring this route to determine if an extension should be considered in the future due to changes in travel demand or
land use. Future changes will be evaluated as part of RTD's existing three‐times‐per‐year service change process.

I was wondering if you guys can extend route 44 to the I‐25 & Broadway Station?

Thank you for your input! Extending Route 44 to the I‐25 & Broadway Station would duplicate the service provided by Route 0, that
currently operates at a high frequency. RTD will continue monitoring this route to determine if an extension should be considered in the
future due to changes in travel demand or land use. Future changes will be evaluated as part of RTD's existing three‐times‐per‐year

The proposed transit service plan for Route 120 along 120th Ave. connecting US 36 Broomfield Station, I‐25 Wagon Road, and the N‐
Line Rail station indicates a decrease in weekday service span to only 6:00 p.m. Request weekday service to continue until 10 p.m. and
Saturday and Sunday/Holiday service run until 9:00 p.m. as is currently in operation today. This corridor primarily serves retailers and
employers providing essential goods and services and connects US 36 Broomfield Station to some of the northernmost stations along I‐
25 to access the RTD regional network. 120 is part of the NAMS network Broomfield and CDOT are working on multiple studies, plans,
and current construction efforts to improve access and safety for people walking, bicycling and access to transit.

Concerned that through 2027 RTD does not plan to neither monitor nor restore fixed‐route service in Interlocken between US 36
Broomfield and US 36 and Flatiron Station at any point. Interlocken is home to over 12,000 employees ranging from office work to
retail and service industries. It is also an area emerging with infill development for residential with several thousand residents and
growing. We request that the area be monitored for the appropriate time to restore the fixed route over the next six years. We are
concerned about loss of fixed‐route service for transit‐dependent riders on 228 and the lack of advertising by RTD to promote
Interlocken/Westmoor FlexRide as an option for workers in Interlocken, in particular hotel and retail/service employees and other
potentially transit‐dependent populations with limited affordable mobility options.

Service reductions in the vicinity of US 287/Midway Blvd with the rerouting of 112 and120 and elimination of 225 on US 287 between
Broomfield and Lafayette since 2018 have negatively impacted transit access to low‐income and vulnerable populations in Broomfield.

120, 112, 128). Please see Broomfield’s 2018 letter to RTD regarding these impacts. US 287 service in Broomfield has been reduced

Thank you for your input! RTD conducted a federally‐required Title VI analysis on the SOP that determined low‐income routes are
allocated almost 12% more trips compared to higher‐income routes, and minority routes are allocated almost 13% more trips than non‐
minority routes. In addition to the federally‐required Title VI analysis, the SOP was developed to meet the existing travel needs of as
many members of equity communities (i.e., low‐income, and minority) and/or zero car households as possible. To do this, the SOP
focused on providing high frequency service to those areas where the highest concentrations of equity community members live or
work. As compared to September, 2021, the SOP results in a 50% increase in access to 15‐minute or better service for equity community
members throughout the District. The SOP also works to balance services in areas with a high‐density of equity community members
with providing connecting service to less‐dense equity community members in the suburbs as much as possible.

We would like to see a more holistic approach and request that RTD delay board adoption of the SOP until the Mobility Plan for the
Future and System Optimization Plan can be brought forward simultaneously so stakeholders can provide input on the complete
package. We feel that this combined approach would better help us understand how the two plans fit together. We look forward to the
Mobility Plan for the Future and understanding how the System Optimization Plan is a step toward the implementation of the broader
and strategic vision for all districts served by RTD. A more comprehensive understanding of this vision would also ensure potential
consequences and implications to residents by way of current and future development planning could be addressed. As currently
proposed, the lack of a robust multimodal network supported by transit could significantly impact the community. Specifically, if the
Mobility Plan for the Future does not indicate that services will be restored to our neighborhoods, businesses in Interlocken, or
expanded service along CO‐7, as previously planned with RTD, to improve overall network connectivity, then this will create a significant
and lasting detrimental impact on the Broomfield community. Broomfield needs some time to understand the consequences of RTD’s
Plans and its implications on our development planning, transportation planning, and the impact of the lack of a robust multimodal
network supported by transit.

Thank you for your input! Based on stakeholder feedback, the public outreach period was extended for one month. RTD received over
1,600 comments and feels confident that this reflects robust feedback from the public and stakeholders. RTD has also slowed down the
timing for formal approval of the SOP to allow more time for consideration of SOP comments and to discuss how the SOP integrates
with the Mobility Plan for the Future.

The SOP cannot ignore the sources of funding that RTD receives. The voters approved a special tax for FasTracks and there is a separate

TABOR should the revenue limit be reimposed.

Thank you for your input! The SOP is focused on meeting the existing travel needs of as many people in the District as possible by
balancing the need to restore service to corridors that exhibit high ridership with the need to connect less densely populated areas so
that riders can travel throughout the District. RTD collects sales and use tax on a district‐wide basis and provides service at a regional
level based on this approach. With few exceptions, RTD's services cross numerous jurisdictional boundaries, making it difficult to
equitably allocate service by sub‐area. RTD's 0.4 and 0.6 percent sales tax are collected and distributed on a District‐wide basis.
Additionally, the SOP is linked directly to RTD's Mid‐Term Financial plan and does not assume any change in TABOR status.

The SOP should reflect opportunities for multi‐agency partnerships in order to show the potential for RTD to work with others to bring

We have significant concerns about the public engagement approach for a plan that sets the direction of the RTD transit network for the

very short. • No information about the plan was available as a feature story at the RTD News Stop until approximately February 4.● The

We sincerely appreciate the challenges RTD must balance to reverse ridership loss, improve efficiency, ensure fiscal sustainability, and
address changing travel demands while balancing the operational capacity of the workforce. This review and refinement of RTD’s transit

throughout the district creates a strong network that provides an attractive option for current riders that depend on the service,

The SOP should include benchmarks to help the RTD and regional stakeholders gauge progress in achieving the plan over time. For

Thank you for your input! RTD conducted a federally‐required Title VI analysis on the SOP that determined low‐income routes are
allocated almost 12% more trips compared to higher‐income routes, and minority routes are allocated almost 13% more trips than non‐
minority routes. In addition to the federally‐required Title VI analysis, the SOP was developed to meet the existing travel needs of as
many members of equity communities (i.e., low‐income, and minority) and/or zero car households as possible. To do this, the SOP
focused on providing high frequency service to those areas where the highest concentrations of equity community members live or
work. As compared to September, 2021, the SOP results in a 50% increase in access to 15‐minute or better service for equity community
members throughout the District. The SOP also works to balance services in areas with a high‐density of equity community members

Thank you for your input! Pre‐pandemic ridership on Route 128 was consistently low ‐ averaging approximately 11 riders per hour in

I use the FF5, FF1, the A line, and the Jump. I have no problems with the design of the routes. It would be ideal to have more FF5 (the

In Arvada, while Route 53 is being reinstated, the overall operation on Sheridan (SH‐95) with mostly 60 minute frequency while
connecting to the G‐Line and US‐36 needs to be increased to promote ridership. This route also presents opportunities for partnerships
with CDOT and Arvada to create transit supportive signals, bus stops, and improved operational efficiency.

Thank you for your input! Based on existing ridership levels, the SOP determined that the current service frequency appropriately

In Arvada, west of Wadsworth Blvd and the Olde Town G‐Line Station, operate Rt 72 on Ralston Road (W 58th Ave, Diagonal Ralston Rd,
and W 64th Ave) and remove Fixed Route operations from side‐streets. Use Mobility On Demand (FlexRide) to serve transportation

In Arvada, Rt 76 frequency needs to be coordinated (and increased during peak periods) with Rt 80 given its overlapping operation on

While Route 125 service was suspended with a drop in traffic demand in COVID‐19, roadway traffic levels and travel has bounced back.
This demand is better served by Mobility On Demand (FlexRide) and service in west Arvada should not be eliminated. Connectivity to
the Ward Road G‐Line Station should be considered with the FlexRide planning efforts.
Park & Ride lots should be planned with the GS service and other "commuter" bus routes. Given its operation on a CDOT highway, SH‐
93, this is an opportunity for a partnership with CDOT and Arvada.
The SOP design is similar to the Guiding Principles, where we agree with the foundational statements and have concerns about the
results from the Draft Plan not reflecting the objectives...
Simplification
Consistency
Reliability
To achieve the objectives, it is necessary to focus Fixed Bus services on Major Arterial routes within the Core, Connect, Commute, and
Community categories. However, we're seeing results such as Rt 72 and Rt 52 that zig‐zag and meander through neighborhoods in the
SOP
You'll notice that a core part of Ralston Road, with nearly 27,000 AADT and an array of destinations, has no service while transit routes
would operate on Local and Collector side‐streets. Again, this is a fatal flaw that needs to be addressed for Ralston Road and doesn't
match the Simplification objective of the SOP.
For Consistency, the focus should shift to Major Roadways. Most parts of Highways and Major Arterials in the City of Arvada such as W
64th Ave (SH‐72), W 72nd Ave, Indiana Street (SH‐72), with traffic volumes exceeding 20,000 AADT, show no Fixed Route transit service.
Major corridors such as Sheridan (SH‐95), Wadsworth (SH‐121), and Kipling have weak transit service with bus frequency reduced to
bare minimums, impacting the Reliability.

Thank you for your input! Schedules will be coordinated between routes as much as possible. It is necessary to take into account not

cost an additional $600,000.
Thank you for your input! For Route 100, the SOP includes operating at 30 minute frequencies between the G Line and the Federal

costs.

The results reflect this fatal flaw. The City of Arvada has several industrial/commercial work centers along Indiana Street (State Highway
72) and community resources at Arvada City Hall that are not connected by transit as a result of the current plan. Furthermore, West
Arvada has seen unprecedented growth and is near buildout 8 years prior to forecasts. Indiana Street (SH‐72) in particular has grown
from 6,000 AADT to over 26,000 AADT in the past 10 years.

Thank you for your input! Based on feedback and suggestions provided by the Arvada Transportation Committee, Routes 52 and 72
were adjusted in the SOP by swapping the western ends of both routes so that Route 52 can operate along Ralston Road.

With TNCs operating in the area and density increasing, commercial development increasing, and industrial sites developing, the drop in
transit ridership numbers is not a strong indicator for the robust market conditions and transit planning has not kept up with regional
development. To gain efficiencies and rebuild ridership, RTD must focus on congested travel corridors. The policy needs to reflect
operating Fixed Route buses on Major Arterials while Mobility and Equity needs for neighborhoods are served through Mobility On
Demand (FlexRide) services. This will in‐turn serve the Sustainability, Financial, and Workforce principles.

There may be a significant problem with the modeling and assignment of trips to the "Districts" in the model, and further study and
analysis may be warranted before proceeding with the approval of the Draft SOP.
The Comprehensive Assessment of RTD Services report referenced eighteen "Districts" for comparison boardings by District, (CAS Table
4. p.32), and shows the location of these Districts on Figure 38, page 34. Your RTD District L and part of Chair Buzek's District is the "W
Northwest District" as shown in the Figure.
Thank you for your input! All districts have been accounted for and are included in the travel analysis and assignment. The first
paragraph from the top of page 44 explains that the tables have collapsed information outside the core for reporting purposes only.
A discussion of Travel Flows and Trip Characteristics begins on page 43, and references Tables 5, 6, and 7 which show matrices of trips
between the various "Districts". However, these matrices do not include the "W Northwest District", the "Longmont District" or several
other suburban "Districts".
Because of page size limitations, Table 5 does not include a row and column for every single district. Some districts were combined so
that the table would fit on the table in a legible way. Districts such as Longmont and others are summed together an put in “Other.”
The omission of these "Districts" from these analysis tables should be concerning to all who live in the suburbs and depend on transit.
I suggest that all tables with the missing information for suburban "Districts" be revised and resubmitted and that an independent firm You’ll notice that there are a very high number of total trips in this “Other” category. These were group together consciously, because

I've been disappointed in the symbology used in previous RTD presentations. The attached example from the Title VI regs provides a
much better symbology that the consultant could use to better communicate the contents of the Draft SOP to the public and the Board.
First, the map contains a Legend as well as a description of the layers in the map.
Next, the line weight indicates the level of service provided by frequency. The Draft SOP might consider using three different line
weights based on the non‐peak weekday frequency, both for the existing run board, but also for the 2022 Fall and 2027 run boards of:
30‐minutes or less, 1 hour or less, and All other services

uses two shades of the percent of the population (decennial Census Block Group), less than or equal to the average in the district.
RTD may want to use three, i.e. less than or equal to the average, greater than the average and greater than 40% of the population (this
number coming from C.R.S. 24‐4‐109) and the current 2020 Census Block Group demographics.
The location amenities including bus stops and transit hubs and Access‐a‐Ride service areas are important components to service
planning, both for the present, the 2022 Run board, and the 2027 future.
Do you think it's possible to get these improvements in the symbology and the additional layers required by Title VI?
I think this will help provide a lot of information to the political leaders who had questions on the calls this morning.

Many people are having trouble getting to work because the Route 77 is no longer providing service. We need help, many workers are
struggling and FlexRide is not enough. There are never enough reservations and trying to catch it without a reservation is not reliable,
especially when weather is bad. Lately we have been walking and it is very, very cold. Even if the route operated once per hour, that
would be helpful. What we have right now is not enough. FlexRide service gets used up and sometimes it takes people to the very edge
of the service area, meaning the vehicle has less time to pick people up along what would be a regular route. It takes away from people
going to the station or to work. I want the Board of Directors to know this and hope that our request for this service is heard.

N Line service needs to be at 20 minutes or less as promised by RTD during design and construction when the jurisdictions along the N
Line compromised and allowed the service not to be 15‐minute headways so the line could be built further north. Not doing so furthers
the perception, right or wrong, that RTD breaks promises made and does not care about or want to provide service in our area. In
addition, the N Line should be a Core Route, as its ridership is equal to the G Line that is going to 15‐minute headways. The N Line
needs to be completed.
Route 93L needs to have 30‐minute headways, not 60‐minute headways to increase ridership and meet needs of vulnerable
populations. 93L shows old routing needs to show new routing north of 136th Avenue.
It is interesting that there are no Core Bus or Rail routes north and east of I‐270 / US 36 until Boulder County. The draft SOP plan does
not address and seems to reinforce, right or wrong, the perceptions, ignored expressed concerns, and appearance that RTD neither
keeps promises nor cares about robustly provided transit to serve our area. I suggest that RTD develop a plausible and believable
explanation to explain why the residents and businesses in this area will not have a Core Bus or Rail routes when densities are similar to
other areas in the metro that have core routes, will not have the service promised when building and opening the N Line, not correcting
base maps that have continually been pointed out in this process, and not providing service to approximately one‐half of Thornton’s
population and area (though are taxes are collected that go to RTD). Using past ridership numbers is not a reason when there was little
to no service to begin with from RTD. RTD is sent every development plan to provide comments on, thus, there is no excuse of RTD not
planning to and serving these newer populations.

Thank you for your input! Current track configurations on the N Line limit the ability to initiate frequency improvements without
additional capital enhancements. The SOP is focused on optimizing RTD's existing services to best meet the current travel needs of the
region. Additional capital expansion was not considered as part of the SOP.
Thank you for your input! RTD will continue monitoring this route to determine if service enhancements should be considered in the
future due to changes in travel demand or land usage. Future changes will be evaluated as part of RTD's existing three‐times‐per‐year
service change process. RTD will update the one‐page route summaries to correct this information. The final, updated route summaries
will be uploaded to RTD's website.

Thanks for your input! Core routes were identified based on population density, key employment destinations, major ridership drivers, a
variation of ridership needs (vs. just am and pm) and assumed levels of transit dependency. The SOP is a financially‐constrained, data
driven plan that balances service needs with available funding. While RTD tries to accommodate service needs for future development
plans, it needs to focus on first providing service to areas with existing high population and employment densities.

Route AB needs stop at Quebec Street and E‐470 in the future. Not sure that is by 2027, as the interchange will be modified by the
development surrounding the interchange and now is the time to request the developer to include the stop in its plans. This will not

Route 128 needs to be implemented per the N Line bus changes. The presentation wrongly states the Broomfield FlexRide can cover
the area of the route and that the reason for not including it is low ridership. The new routing is different from the old Route 128. Not
having the 128 will cause some users to have a 3 or 4 seat ride to the N Line and they will find other options thus reducing ridership on
the N Line and transit and contribute to greenhouse gases. FYI – the new 128 Route serves a disadvantage area in Thornton and new
apartments that are under construction west of Washington Street.
Pre‐pandemic I was an avid rider of the FF4 ‐ I live in Superior and work in Denver ‐ uptown at 19th and Lincoln.

times as well as evening. I have taken the FF1 and it takes more time for me to get to work and it is not convenient for me. I am
begging for you to bring back the FF4 route. It seems that with the initiatives to decrease miles driven, reduce GHG, this would be an
obvious choice to help meet those goals. With the recent passage of the transportation bill in the CO senate, it also seems there were
some monies allocated to helping RTD recover from the pandemic.
I welcome any further inquiries, but I plead for you to bring back that route and others to help get drivers off the road.

My comment would be that it is very difficult and time consuming for those of us that take the Wagon Road PnR to get to Civic Center
Plaza now that the 122X express bus no longer is running. We have to take the 120X to Union Station, take our chances with the awful
conditions at DUS, and either wait to catch the 0 or 15 bus or take the Mall Shuttle, which is equally odious, to get to Civic Center. 122X
used to take us straight to Civic Center. Now it is an extra 20+ minutes plus having to deal with DUS and Union Station. 1 hour 15

Why can't the 122X be scheduled along with the 120X, even if the 120X had to be cut to every 1/2 hour then have the 122X run every

I am writing to object strenuously to RTD's proposed System Optimization Plan (SOP) that would eliminate the JUMP route in Erie, the
only transit service we have in Town. This is exactly the opposite of what the rapidly growing Town of Erie needs; we need much better
transit service, not to lose the paltry service we currently have. Perhaps you and others at RTD don't recall the many times I have

pointed out how fast the Town of Erie is growing and our desperate need to have better RTD service. As I have said before, although
more efficient service.
Erie is a town of 31,000 residents and growing rapidly, Erie residents live in a transit desert; there are few RTD options for Erie residents
to use if they work elsewhere or for people who work in Erie to reach their jobs without using a car. Because transit options in Erie are
so limited, individual vehicle trips dominate our roadways and add to Front Range traffic and commuting pollution.

Malcolm Fleming

To help you better understand our plight, I want to share a few facts that are worth noting in Erie's quest to expand RTD service.
Currently, Erie has 2,700 commuters per day traveling from Erie to Boulder. From Erie to Denver, it is 1,389 and to Longmont, it is
around 825 commuters. Combined, this accounts for nearly 4,000 vehicles each day using four main routes: Arapahoe Road, SH 7
/Baseline Road, SH 287 and I‐25. As Erie continues to grow, unless we get transit service on I‐25 and better transit service on Arapahoe,
SH 7 and SH 287 the number of single occupant vehicles on these and other roadways will continue to grow. Proposing to eliminate the
JUMP service from Erie is a slap in the face of our community's efforts to get better transit service.

Erie s current options are in stark contrast to what Erie needs to better serve residents, and to do our part to reduce GHG emissions
contributing to climate disruption, which is fueling events like the Marshall Fire. For reference, Erie's current public transit service is
limited to the following:
•Erie Boulder roundtrip ‐ JUMP from ECC ‐ Route runs 6:55 a.m. to 10:llp.m M‐ Saturday, no Service Sunday and at best 30 minutes
headways.
•LD/LD1/LD3 skirts Erie's west side on SH 287 and goes south to Denver and north to Longmont ‐ nearly 6 miles from the heart of
downtown Erie. We don't have a "last mile" problem, we have a "last six miles" problem.
•There is one stop on the LD routes (with no parking facili es) on Erie's west side at Diamond Circle.
•The Bustang North Line does not serve Erie (it travels I‐25 north to Fort Collins and south to Denver, but the nearest stop to Erie is at
the Loveland/Greeley Park and Ride, 30 miles north of Erie. No one in their right mind would drive 30 miles north to catch a bus to then
go 50 miles south to Denver. Consequently, no one from Erie does.
•RTD's Trip Planner suggests if you want to go from Erie to downtown Denver, you must go through Boulder on a route that would take
over two hours.
•In contrast to Erie's paltry RTD service, Nederland, with a popula on of 1,547 (compared to Erie's 31,000+), has be er RTD bus service
than Erie. In Nederland there is a bus into or from Boulder every hour during peak hours and every two hours off peak from 7:23 AM to
11:33PM.

Please don't misunderstand me, I strongly support the RTD service to Nederland and want to see it continued. But to honor RTD's
Guiding Principles and to provide equitable service levels comparable to those enjoyed by Nederland and many other communities RTD
should expand service to Erie‐not cut it. Transit service is essential for anyone who does not have access to a car but who still needs to
get to and from work, school, and other commitments in Erie.
Thank you for your input! Ridership to Nederland has historically been approximately three times the ridership to Erie. Overall RTD
determine ridership needs not just based on population, including ridership generators, which are factors of land use.
Please do NOT implement the proposed SOP actions that would eliminate the JUMP service in Erie. I would be happy to meet with you
and your staff to discuss Erie transit needs and develop an equitable plan to serve Erie's expanding population.

On behalf of Arvada City Council, I am submitting this letter to express concerns related to the Reimagine RTD process and the current Service
Optimization Plan (SOP) proposal. The City of Arvada agrees with the foundational blocks of the Reimagine RTD initiative and finds that the
SOP does not reflect its guiding principles. We would like to invite you to visit the Arvada community to experience the feedback and concerns
that we receive related to RTD. The City of Arvada has historically supported transit by incorporating transit into the local Transportation
Planning documents and participating in regionalism at DRCOG with RTD representatives. Yet, the proposed SOP demonstrates a major
cutback in service for the fifth‐largest city in the Denver region. Without FlexRide, Fixed Bus Routes, and robust connections to the G‐Line
Commuter Rail Stations, Arvadans feel underserved and taxpayer confidence in RTD is low. The current Reimagine documents do not
demonstrate the locations of transit hubs or offer information on the long‐range mobility plan for the Arvada community. A fatal flaw of the

Council. In addition, Council member Bob Fifer, who is a representative on the Reimagine Policy Group, has directly expressed concerns with
the public input process. Advertising a major document for public comment through the holiday season, as well as offering a GIS map buried
on the RTD website does not meet public outreach expectations for our aging population. The City of Arvada has experienced unprecedented
growth in recent years. Growth rates in west Arvada are at 12.5% and the City has managed to retain 97% of businesses through the pandemic.
The SOP needs to demonstrate how transit is designed to be a key part of Arvada’s growth and address public interests in reducing
environmental impacts from transportation related greenhouse gas emissions. The City of Arvada is a community of over 124,402 residents
and nearing buildout. We urge RTD to slow the process, incorporate more robust outreach, and connect with the local communities to
demonstrate how the guiding principles will be incorporated into the final plan prior to presenting the SOP to the RTD Board.

terminate at the future CO‐7/I‐25 mobility hub is also shown as an additional fixed‐route service. The extension of this fixed‐route bus
route would help provide critical north‐south mobility and minimize passenger transfers. Consistent with the Broomfield Transportation
Plan, please consider extending the route by 2027 as facilities for transit are constructed, new development for housing and
employment increase demand for access in north Broomfield County. Consider 30‐minute headways as resources allow and network
connectivity is increased by 2027.
I was trying to add a comment for Ralston Rd between Wadsworth and Independence that the bus should run on this street instead of
through the neighborhood to the south. The current route skips this portion of Ralston that has density and shopping and people who
take the bus to these stores (Walmart, King Soopers).
We appreciate the restoration of some of the Flatiron Flyer route patterns with additional peak service capacity to provide increased
frequency, increasing the convenience and reliability of the service along US 36 to Denver and Boulder destinations. The HX and BMX
routes have served the region for decades as high performing routes (now the FF4 and FF2) and restoring these routes is critical to the
future of transit use in our area. Thank you for listening to our feedback driven by riders of this service.

Thank you for your input! Based on existing ridership levels, the SOP determined that the current route alignment appropriately
addresses the travel demand along this corridor. However, RTD will continue monitoring this route to determine if an extension should
be considered in the future due to changes in travel demand or land use. The final also SOP includes funding for expansion of FlexRide
and Mobility on Demand (MOD) service areas, which might be appropriate for this area. RTD will be working directly with local
municipalities to identify specific needs and to develop partnerships to expand FlexRide and MOD service areas as funding and
workforce constraints allow.
Thank you for your input! Based on feedback and suggestions provided by the Arvada Transportation Committee, Routes 52 and 72
were adjusted in the SOP by swapping the western ends of both routes so that Route 52 can operate along Ralston Road.
Thank you for your input! Current track configurations on the N Line limit the ability to initiate frequency improvements without
additional capital enhancements. The SOP is focused on optimizing RTD's existing services to best meet the current travel needs of the

Thank you for your input! The LBR included in the SOP more closely aligns with the planned US 287 BRT corridor. In response to other

A minimum level of service is needed for people to be able to see transit as a reliable transportation option. The service frequencies in
the proposed SOP appear to be greatly reduced, to the point that is appears it will hinder many people from effectively relying on
transit.

Thank you for your input! The SOP improves regional accessibility to frequent service and provides transit service coverage to other
areas, to the extent achievable within the SOP financial and workforce constraints. The SOP provides a 57% increase in district‐wide
access to 15‐minute or better service throughout the entire District as compared to September 2021 service levels.

The SOP should include benchmarks to help the RTD and regional stakeholders gauge progress in achieving the plan over time. For
example, what is the sequencing for implementation of the plan? How will the SOP tie to the Mobility Plan for the Future?

Thank you for your input! Implementation of SOP service improvements will occur as financial and workforce resources allow through
RTD's existing three‐times‐per‐year service change process. The entire SOP is planned to be implemented no later than 2027. The
Mobility Plan for the Future will build upon the SOP to establish a vision for addressing the future transportation needs of the region.

The SOP cannot ignore the sources of funding that RTD receives. The voters approved a special tax for FasTracks and there is a separate
tax for base service. The SOP must demonstrate that the uses of funds are consistent with their legal designation. One approach to
doing this would be to optimize the subsystems by funding stream. Within each funding source racial equity, serving low‐income
communities, climate impact, and cost recovery should be considered at the forefront while meeting the mission or allowable use of
funds. In addition, more information is needed regarding the RTD’s proposals related to addressing potential revenue limits under
TABOR should the revenue limit be reimposed.
There appears to be a lack of cohesion with major regional planning efforts. The SOP is inconsistent with the 2014 RTD North Area
Mobility Study (NAMS) and the 2019 RTD Bus Rapid Transit Study. The NAMS corridors are envisioned to be the multimodal corridors
that connect the DRCOG Metro Vision Urban Centers in the northwest, where communities have committed to focusing local
development growth in residential and employment. CDOT Region 1 and Region 4 have also committed significant funding to several
NAMS corridors to supportmul modal transporta on in the CDOT 10‐Year Plan Project Pipeline. We request that the corresponding
existing transit service in the SOP explicitly acknowledge NAMS’s plans for their future and establish a plan for how these routes’ service
patterns will evolve into BRT service in the coming years.

Thank you for your input! The SOP is focused on meeting the existing travel needs of as many people in the District as possible by
balancing the need to restore service to corridors that exhibit high ridership with the need to connect less densely populated areas so
that riders can travel throughout the District. RTD collects sales and use tax on a district‐wide basis and provides service at a regional
level based on this approach. With few exceptions, RTD's services cross numerous jurisdictional boundaries, making it difficult to
equitably allocate service by sub‐area. Additionally, the SOP is linked directly to RTD's Mid‐Term Financial plan and does not assume any
change in TABOR status.
Thank you for your input! In developing the SOP, an extensive library of relevant local and regional plans was compiled and reviewed,
and aspects that best supported the SOP Guiding Principles and existing travel needs were incorporated. The SOP took these plans into
consideration as much as possible, but existing financial and workforce constraints, and the need to best meet the existing travel needs
of the region were limiting factors. Due to the impacts of the COVID‐19 pandemic, the SOP will act as a new baseline for providing
service within RTD's financial and workforce constraints through 2027. These existing constraints do not provide the capacity needed to
add additional new transit services in the short‐term. Future growth and development throughout the region will be addressed as part
of the Mobility Plan for the Future, the component of Reimagine RTD that is focused on long‐term planning for RTD.

The SOP should reflect opportunities for multi‐agency partnerships in order to show the potential for RTD to work with others to bring
about more service. One such example is the opportunity for partners to provide NAMS BRT service beyond what RTD is forecasting it
can operate on its own. We request that RTD highlight these opportunity routes in the SOP. For example, the SOP recommendations for
CO 7, US 287 and CO 42 should be similar to what is shown for CO 119 regarding potential partnerships.

The SOP does not reflect incremental service changes in accordance with the planned BRT service along the CO 7 corridor between
Boulder and Brighton. At a minimum, the plan should revisit the drastic 47% reduction in service hours for the JUMP route and should
show connectivity to the CDOT I‐25/CO 7 transit stop improvements planned to be constructed in 2023 and opened in 2024.

Thank you for your input! The SOP does reflect a significant reduction in JUMP service hours, but when considering the JUMP, 225 and
Dash combined, there is an overall 20% reduction from Aug. 2019 service hours, with Route 225 designated as a Core route providing
15‐minute all‐day service between Lafayette and Boulder. With regards to expansion of JUMP service to I‐25/CO7, this would result in
operating costs beyond what was affordable given the SOP financial constraints.

We have significant concerns about the public engagement approach for a plan that sets the direction of the RTD transit network for the
next six years: • No public meetings are being advertised on the RTD website. • The engagement period for such a large plan effort is
very short. • No information about the plan was available as a feature story at the RTD News Stop until approximately February 4.● The
final promotional language and engagement information was sent to stakeholders after the official launch of engagement, limiting the

We do understand the financial realities that the board is facing. Still, we would like to see a more holistic approach and request that
RTD delay board adoption of the SOP until the Mobility Plan for the Future and System Optimization Plan can be brought forward
simultaneously so stakeholders can provide input on the complete package and potentially illuminate new funding opportunities. We
feel that this combined approach would better help us understand how the two plans fit together and could lead to better service for
the people. We look forward to the Mobility Plan for the Future and understanding how the System Optimization Plan is a step toward
the implementation of the broader and strategic vision for all districts served by RTD.

We sincerely appreciate the challenges RTD must balance to reverse ridership loss, improve efficiency, ensure fiscal sustainability, and
address changing travel demands while balancing the operational capacity of the workforce. This review and refinement of RTD’s transit
services along with financial and operational capacity constraints must consider and address the district‐wide service needs for the
Denver metro region whose taxpayers provide significant levels of local funding for transit service. RTD must consider that transit‐
dependent populations live in every county of the metro region. The proposed SOP will severely impact local and regional access by
equity populations to transit services in the North and Northwest Denver metro. Building and rebuilding ridership should focus on
where transit‐dependent riders live (as you have attempted to do), but it also needs to focus on the job centers and urban centers
transit‐dependent riders travel to in order to work, shop, receive an education, access health care, etc. Connecting our communities
throughout the district creates a strong network that provides an attractive option for current riders that depend on the service,
attracts riders lost during the pandemic, and entices new riders with affordable and sustainable travel options.

Thank you for your input! RTD conducted a federally‐required Title VI analysis on the SOP that determined low‐income routes are
allocated almost 12% more trips compared to higher‐income routes, and minority routes are allocated almost 13% more trips than non‐
minority routes. In addition to the federally‐required Title VI analysis, the SOP was developed to meet the existing travel needs of as
many members of equity communities (i.e., low‐income, and minority) and/or zero car households as possible. To do this, the SOP
focused on providing high frequency service to those areas where the highest concentrations of equity community members live or
work. As compared to September, 2021, the SOP results in a 50% increase in access to 15‐minute or better service for equity community
members throughout the District. The SOP also works to balance services in areas with a high‐density of equity community members
with providing connecting service to less‐dense equity community members in the suburbs as much as possible.

The proposed transit service plan for Route 120 along 120th Ave. connecting US 36 Broomfield Station, I‐25 Wagon Road, and the N‐
Line Rail station indicates a decrease in weekday service span to only 6:00 p.m. This corridor primarily serves retailers and employers
providing essential goods and services and connects some of the northernmost stations along I‐25 to the RTD regional network. We
request that weekday service continue until 10 p.m. and that Saturday and Sunday service run until 9:00 p.m. as is currently in
operation today.

Thank you for your input! Based on feedback from stakeholders and the public, the SOP was modified to include Route 122X in addition
to Route 120X. In peak periods, Route 120X will operate every 15 minutes and Route 122X will operate every 30 minutes for a combined
service every 10 minutes along North I‐25. Implementation of SOP service improvements will occur as financial and workforce resources
allow through RTD's existing three‐times‐per‐year service change process. The entire SOP is planned to be implemented no later than
2027. The SOP analysis includes the route operating until 11 pm but the table includes an error. The table and cut sheets have been
corrected.

We also appreciate RTD bolstering BOLT service on CO 119 in preparation of launching BRT service. RTD is working closely with CDOT,
Boulder County, City of Boulder, and the City of Longmont on a coordinated plan to design and construct elements of the CO 119 BRT
project, with substantial funding for construction in the mid‐2020s already secured. Enhancing BOLT service today will help build the
ridership for successful BRT service in the near future.

Prior to April 2020 Route 128 was served by over 275 riders per day. It not realis c that RTD will be able to meet it’s SOP goal to retain
ridership from Route 128 clients as these formers riders will not be able to be adequately served by FlexRide due to capacity. Primary
des na ons of this local route included access to the regional transporta on network at US 36 Broomfield Sta on and I‐25 Wagon Road
as well as the Broomfield Civic area to access County services at 3rd and Spader Way.● Broomfield has requested RTD to expand
Broomfield FlexRide service to Wagon Road for several years. Since April 2020 Broomfield residents along route 128 have not had
access to Wagon Road. Only recently, a transfer has been provided by connec ng FlexRides. The transfer connec on does provide a
connec vity op on, but is ineﬃcient and not convenient for riders.● Former transit riders along the eastern por on of route 128 have
not had access to transit services at Wagon Road since April 2020 and are denied transit access to the N‐Line sta on. This SOP will make
the elimina on of access permanent as no apparent changes are made to FlexRide or Mobility on Demand services to improve access to

There is little detail in the SOP regarding plans for new or expanded FlexRide service or Mobility‐on‐Demand services. It is important for
new and expanded services to meet not only gaps left by discontinuing routes, but also to meet existing suburban travel patterns.
Additional information should be shared with stakeholders prior to conclusion of the SOP.● There appears to be discrepancies in MOD
areas shown to staff in December and the map that is available for public comment.● Concerned that northern Broomfield is not
included in the FlexRide/Mobility on Demand service area by 2027.● Significant development is underway in North Broomfield
Thank you for your input! The final SOP includes funding for expansion of FlexRide and Mobility on Demand (MOD) service areas. RTD
supporting new residents and employment along CO‐7 mobility services will be needed by 2027 to support new district residents and

access to multimodal options along CO‐7 and at the I‐25/CO‐7 interchange at the CDOT mobility hub that is anticipated to be in service
service areas as funding and workforce constraints allow.
in 2024/2025● Broomfield has an IGA with RTD (partnership with 100% non‐RTD funding) to expand FlexRide services, including
opportunities to explore enhancing operations north of 144th Ave. to neighborhoods currently not served by RTD. These expansions are
not fully realized. Connectivity to Wagon Road and Rock Creek Medical center is needed.● Increased access to transit to des na ons in
the northern part of the RTD District is needed, including flexibility to access goods, services, and employment across jurisdictional
boundaries.

Prior to COVID, Broomfield had limited local access, with the SOP adoption, the identified equity populations in Broomfield County
access to transit options are severely negatively impacted.● Route 128 serves equity popula ons in Broomfield including low‐income
and minority populations identified by DRCOG Environmental Justice Zones and in the RTD’s March 2021 Service Equity Report Figures
2, 3 and 5.● Route 128 also serves the apartment complexes that accept Housing Choice Vouchers in Broomfield, including low‐income
older adult populations, highest concentrations in Broomfield for households with one or zero vehicles, Limited English Proficiency, and
also provides access to mobility options for underserved populations within Broomfield.

Thank you for your input! Pre‐pandemic ridership on Route 128 was consistently low ‐ averaging approximately 11 riders per hour in

almost 12% more trips compared to higher‐income routes, and minority routes are allocated almost 13% more trips than non‐minority
routes. In addition to the federally‐required Title VI analysis, the SOP was developed to meet the existing travel needs of as many
members of equity communities (i.e., low‐income, and minority) and/or zero car households as possible. To do this, the SOP focused on
providing high frequency service to those areas where the highest concentrations of equity community members live or work. As
compared to September, 2021, the SOP results in a 50% increase in access to 15‐minute or better service for equity community
members throughout the District. The SOP also works to balance services in areas with a high‐density of equity community members
with providing connecting service to less‐dense equity community members in the suburbs as much as possible.

Service reductions in the vicinity of US 287/Midway Blvd with the rerouting of 112 and 120 and elimination of 225 between Broomfield
and Lafayette since 2018 have negatively impacted transit access to low‐income and minority populations in Broomfield. The changes
significantly reduced frequency, destination options and eliminated Saturday and Sunday services for equity populations in the vicinity
of US287/Midway/Nickel Street to Main Street. Please see Broomfield’s 2018 letter to RTD regarding these impacts.● Shown below are

Route 38: West 38th Ave is the main commercial corridor for Wheat Ridge, and includes several small and large businesses and retail
centers, senior housing and care facilities, multi‐family housing, the soon to be redeveloped Lutheran Campus, Wheat Ridge Recreation

RTD needs to focus on system reliability ‐ how will the SOP help?

Thank you for your input! While this was not specifically addressed in the SOP, RTD is working hard to increase the size of our workforce
so that in the future we can provide more reliable service. Additionally, the SOP splits some of our longest routes into shorter segments
to help increase our on‐time performance and on routes where we increased the frequency of service, reliability should improve.

RTD needs to address safety concerns for riders ‐ are their partnership opportunities for non‐profits to help provide system navigators,
social services, etc.?

Thank you for your input! The Mobility Guiding Principle for the Reimagine RTD project states that RTD will “Provide safe, reliable
transportation service to improve the quality of life of residents, customers and visitors.” Safety is an inherent aspect of the SOP
because all the SOP recommendations are by definition a reflection of our established safety culture. RTD feels confident that we are
providing transit services safely. Commuter rail, for example, is celebrating 18 months without a signal violation or accident on the N
Line and our bus operators drive in a safe manner, do not exceed speed limits, etc. However, RTD recognizes recent challenges
throughout the system related to security and is working hard to restore a secure environment for customers, employees, visitors and
nearby residents. RTD is implementing a system‐wide plan that encompasses security topics related to RTD's operations, our
passengers, motorists, cyclists and pedestrians. If you reach out to our customer service desk, you can be connected to our

DOTI transit staff agree with RTDs assessment of the economy that the Region is working with a “new normal,” and that “pre‐
pandemic” is no longer a relevant goal. RTD is correct to resist attempts to spend money faster in an attempt to accelerate the return‐
to‐office goal, because DOTI staff believe other factors play stronger roles in the return‐to‐office goal than transit service levels (e.g.
internal company policies, health orders, congestion levels, etc.). Work‐from‐home/telecommuting was a temporary necessity early in
the COVID‐19 pandemic, but appears to have become more of an expectation by many employees at this point.

It’s clear that workforce (available operators & mechanics) will be a critical risk and/or opportunity to the successful implementation of
additional services over the 2022‐2027 time period. CCD is willing to share staff‐level knowledge and strategy, at the very least,
regarding the recruitment of CDL drivers so that the Region can collectively fill more vacant driver/operator positions.

RTD can have 50+ municipalities in the DRCOG Region and RTD District, each pursuing their own interests, or working together in
regional unison. Denver believes strongly in regionalism. It was successful for the FasTracks expansion and is a good model for re‐
building RTDs service after the pandemic. The Region’s communities are inter‐connected on so many levels. Denver has at least 15
immediate jurisdictional neighbors, touching Denver boundaries. Transit service goals for air quality and mobility are important to many
communities around the region, and even those communities not contiguous with Denver, many residents travel to/from and through Thank you for your input!
Denver. It is therefore inappropriate to split RTDs budget or services into county‐based or municipality‐based line items, regarding the
base 0.6% sales & use tax, or the 0.4% FasTracks sales & use tax. If individual municipalities add money from their own general fund or
otherwise obtain funds, however, it may be appropriate for services paid in that way to remain financially fire‐walled from the overall
RTD budget. In general, travel sheds/patterns for the region should be the basis for RTDs transit service delivery.

Service monitoring will be important over the period 2022‐2027 (six years, 18 runboards). Many of the longer routes, are proposed to
be segmented into more logical pieces, with the intent to better adjust service levels (service supply) to rider demand, and to also
increase service reliability. Shorter route segments will work well for all passengers if the connections at transfer hubs and mobility
hubs are also reliable. Service monitoring will help assure supply and demand continue to be balanced as the Region moves forward,
and to address any places where reliability might be less than expected.

Thank you for your input! Yes, RTD will continue to monitor the overall performance of the SOP and updates will occur through RTD's
existing three‐times‐per‐year service change process.

CCD staff have analyzed both a recent runboard (September 5, 2021 – January 8, 2022…current runboard at the time it was done in late
December) and the proposed 2027 SOP service levels against the aspirational Denver Moves Transit service levels. This focuses on 25
key corridors throughout the city. In 22 of the 25 corridors RTDs proposed 2027 SOP service levels either maintain already‐good service
levels (e.g. Rte 15/15L ‐ East Colfax) or improve lesser service levels toward more preferred post‐pandemic service levels (e.g. Rte 30 –
South Federal, and 73 ‐ Quebec). In three corridors, RTDs proposal for standardization of “core” and “connect” service levels appears to
modestly reduce frequencies compared to the current runboard (Routes: 31 – North Federal, 38 – West 38th, and the 43 – East MLK

Blvd). CCD makes no objections at this point, instead preferring to follow the philosophies of Regionalism and service monitoring, as the
basis of evaluating incremental changes for the whole system. Please see the attached spreadsheet for a comparison of the September
2021 RTD services, proposed 2027 RTD services, and our own Denver Moves Transit goals for services desired by 2030. Please also see
the attached a two‐slide presentation showing 2027 RTD alone, and 2027 RTD compared to 2030 Denver Moves Transit (DMT) goals.
We share these observations, not in conflict with the “regionalism” statement above, but in the vein of the City’s interest in potentially
buying‐up transit service with our own funds.

Addressing Service Performance and Efficiency Much of RTD's service has historically been oriented toward commuting to downtown
Denver. That orientation results in many long, “one‐seat ride” routes with benefits to commuters going to jobs in the urban core. The
tradeoffs are two‐fold. First, long routes often reduce on‐time performance, making the service less reliable. Second, this type of
orientation makes destinations other than downtown Denver less accessible. RTD should consider orienting more transit services
Thank you for your input! Many of the recommendations in the SOP reorientate service to destinations other than downtown Denver.

throughout the region. We understand that RTD is trying to balance many demands within a set of workforce and funding constraints.
We believe changes to the SOP that respond to our comments will strengthen RTDs services in the near term and position RTD for
future service growth. We look forward to continued engagement on this and other important issues with RTD.

DRCOG

I am writing on behalf of the DRCOG Board of Directors to offer our comments on RTD’s draft System Optimization Plan (SOP). The
Board of Directors appreciates the opportunity to comment on the SOP. We are all committed to RTD’s success and look forward to
continued opportunities to partner with RTD to build on the SOP toward a transit system in the region that helps us meet our
transportation goals. During its discussion, the Board noted some key tenets that should drive RTD’s decisions: predictability, reliability,
safety, and fares. Our comments on the SOP focus on the issues of Service Area Coverage and Service Performance and Efficiency.
Addressing the Service Area Challenge Under the draft SOP, transit service has been reduced in areas outside the urban core compared
to pre‐pandemic service levels. Many of these areas contain equity populations including low‐income households and individuals with
disabilities. These populations are more likely to depend on transit access for employment and other opportunities throughout the
region. RTD should guard against tilting the balance too far toward service cost‐effectiveness through just a ridership lens. The SOP
should be adjusted to enhance coverage, especially to improve mobility for low‐income and other disadvantaged communities inside
the RTD boundaries that have limited or no service.

I’m writing to express my support for RTD’s draft System Optimization Plan. The COVID‐19 pandemic highlighted ridership patterns of
people who rely most on public transit to get where they need to go and I am glad to see RTD prioritizing transit dependent riders and
the Title VI Service Equity Policies. Given RTD’s limitations, I believe that this is the right decision‐making philosophy, and support the
adoption of this plan in its current form.

Thank you for your input! RTD conducted a federally‐required Title VI analysis on the SOP that determined low‐income routes are
allocated almost 12% more trips compared to higher‐income routes, and minority routes are allocated almost 13% more trips than non‐
minority routes. In addition to the federally‐required Title VI analysis, the SOP was developed to meet the existing travel needs of as
many members of equity communities (i.e., low‐income, and minority) and/or zero car households as possible. To do this, the SOP
focused on providing high frequency service to those areas where the highest concentrations of equity community members live or
work. As compared to September, 2021, the SOP results in a 50% increase in access to 15‐minute or better service for equity community
members throughout the District. The SOP also works to balance services in areas with a high‐density of equity community members
with providing connecting service to less‐dense equity community members in the suburbs as much as possible.

Thank you for your input! RTD exists because of people like you!

It is concerning that RTD’s 2027 service projections fall well short of what we need in the Denver metro region. I also encourage RTD to

way to minimize losing money is to provide services where there are customers. RTD needs to prioritize routes that are in dense urban

locations of Service Improvements (in green linework), Service Losses (in red linework), and the location of Transit Hubs and bus stops.
Recategorization of the previous service types into the four new ones means little to the riders. They want to know where bus service
will get better, where it will get worse, and where transfer hubs and bus stops will be.
The (green) Service Improvement layer would include route segments like the GS or the route extension to serve Amazon, and new
FlexRide areas, like the one requested by Arvada.
The (red) Service Losses layer would include route segments that were either eliminated or the frequency of services are being reduced.

things, i.e. proposed changes. The upper layers obliterate (or shade, depending on transparency) lower layers.
The software symbology also permits applying transparency and widths to the linework, so that a minor system improvement or service
loss could be used to indicate minor changes in the same layer.
It was difficult for the Transportation Committee to understand and evaluate all the changes proposed by the SOP so we just picked an
easy one, Route 52 to identify impacts to Arvada.
Adding the GIS layers for Service Improvements, Service Losses, and the Transit Hubs and bus stops will go a long way to informing the
community about the changes proposed in the SOP.

I d like to request that RTD revise its communication with the public in all areas ‐‐ signs, email alerts, recorded bus messages, websites,
schedules, etc. ‐‐ to accomplish one simple goal:
Please replace use of transit‐industry jargon with plain English (and in Spanish translations, too, if it's a problem ‐‐ I don't speak Spanish
well enough to know).
Classic example: The System Optimization Plan map Recommendations show 'Headways' for the bus routes. The use of 'Headway' in
those documents is meaningless and confusing outside of RTD ‐‐ please just say 'Frequency of Service'.
It's confusing and kind of officious when an operator says to 'Deboard'
‐‐ why not just say 'Please get off the bus/train'.
'Not in Service' would be much clearer than 'Interline' on a bus. If it's good enough for trains, it's good enough for buses. 'Loop Extra' is
about the same ‐‐ it serves no purpose ‐‐ supervisors and drivers know what buses are parked and reserved for fill‐in service, so it's
unnecessary on the bus signs.
You could go a long way toward improving your image with the public if you make an effort to communicate with them in a clear and
friendly manner. Your technical writers can surely help you with this ‐‐ they've been trained on how to communicate clearly, so go to
them and ask them to help

It is concerning that RTD’s 2027 service projections fall well short of what we need in the Denver metro region. That said, I am
encouraged that RTD has begun identifying opportunities to identify partnerships and funding sources to get public transit back on track
in the metro area.
For example, I completely agree with a cost sharing agreement with Eldora Ski Resort to extend NB service from Nederland. I love to ski
at Eldora and take the bus if I don't carpool with friends. The NB alleviates parking pressure at the resort and reduces traffic en route.
It is perfectly reasonable that Eldora should financially support this service that benefits the resort, its employees, and its patrons. I
believe there are plenty of other similar opportunities, particularly for large events and venues that already attract a number of transit
riders and can strain the network beyond capacity.
My hope is that with creative partnerships and supportive local decision makers, RTD will be able to meet the transit needs of the
district while attracting new riders and increasing the proportion of trips made by transit.

I’m writing to express my support for RTD’s draft System Optimization Plan.
HOWEVER, please PUT BACK our BUS STOP on 18th Street at Larimer. This let us seniors & disabled ride all buses to Union Station and
toward more transit options. This combined with the elimination of the #9 bus several years ago severely cut our RTD bus services.

Thank you for your input! Due to the installation of a new bike lane, this bus stop was removed. However, the City built a new bus stop
at 18th and Blake that is currently in operation. The placement of bus stops depends on many factors such as spacing, right‐of‐way,
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) accessibility and safety. RTD makes every effort to provide accessible and safe stops where
needed, but factors outside of RTD’s control may limit stop placement. Please contact bus.stop@rtd‐denver.com if you have any
additional questions.

We appreciate the difficult tradeoffs RTD is facing as it works to rebuild ridership following the COVID‐19 pandemic, and generally

Were individual subarea travel markets considered in developing the SOP?

Thank you for your input! Yes ‐ specific markets were evaluated as an example, travel needs to and from the Federal Center.

Suggestion that we change the title on the graphic that highlights the benefits of the SOP from “Improve Service Quality” to “Improve
Level of Service”

Thank you for your input!

Interest in analysis of SOP impacts relative to regional air quality/GHG reduction goals

Thank you for your input! The SOP is focused on best meeting the existing travel needs of the District by restoring service to corridors
that exhibit high ridership and serving equity communities that rely on transit to meet their transportation needs. Establishing a vision
for the future transportation needs of the region, including GHG analyses will be addressed as part of the Mobility Plan for the Future,
the component of Reimagine RTD that is focused on long‐term planning for RTD.

Does the SOP assume passage of a continued TABOR exemption for RTD?

Thank you for your input! The SOP financial assumptions do not include a successful TABOR election.

Interest in most recent ridership and workforce statistics

Thank you for your input! For the week ending 5/7/2022 RTD carried 1.26 million passengers. Ridership has been fairly consistent since
March 2022 with about 1.2‐1.3 million boardings per week, which is also consistent with highs seen in the summer of 2021. Average
ridership pre‐COVID was around 2 million per week.

The SOP is about making tough choices with the limited resources available to RTD. We’d be remiss not to note that the 2027 service
projected in the SOP falls well short of what we need to adequately serve the Denver metro region and meet our air quality, climate,
access, and safety goals. Now more than ever we need leaders not just within RTD, but at the local, state, and federal levels to come to
the table to get public transit back on track and identify additional resources for RTD.

I agree with the priorities being used in the RTD SOP. The pandemic lay bare what populations and neighborhoods are most dependent
on transit, and I believe it is both the right thing to do and the smart thing to do, to serve those populations first.
However, I'm deeply concerned with the future service projections for Denver. As a resident of Capitol Hill, we see transit service

I am, as are many people, disappointed with the ambition of the service re‐optimization proposal. There is clearly a shortage of drivers,
and a lack of resources to bring in more. That's a difficult problem to solve without major new funding, but it's frustrating to see no
visible attempt to make up even a fraction of the deficit with efficiency improvements.
With faster buses, the same number of drivers and buses can serve more trips and more people. There are several ways to speed up
buses that have been successful in other places, but never attempted by RTD. San Francisco has had all‐door bus boarding for years, and
Washington is adopting it now too. Another option is stop consolidation; many RTD lines have slow rides due to extremely close stop
spacing.
Thank you for your input! Your thoughtful considerations will be evaluated as we have future opportunities for capital investments,

the bus for fare control, then exit the bus again to load more luggage for any new passengers who have arrived in the meantime. Dwell
times at Table Mesa are scheduled for a full eight minutes, and it can sometimes take twenty minutes to load a full bus at the airport.
This could be improved by having fare controls off board at the airport and/or having someone other than the driver loading luggage
there. Those other personnel have to be paid, but they don't need the unique training and certifications of bus drivers. An example to
consider might be Tokyo‐Narita Airport, where similar regional buses with luggage service routinely load full and depart within five
minutes.
Please consider efficiency improvements to make buses run faster and utilize drivers better before resigning the region to low service

Would like to see the Route 2 be reinstated to address an equity issue, you need to get folks from downtown and then to Cherry Creek
to support jobs.
Removing weekend service on the 402L eliminates all East‐West bus service through Highlands Ranch and to Park Meadows Mall.
Residents in Highlands Ranch utilize this service to travel to and from the Park Meadows Mall area for work and pleasure on weekends
and evenings. Decreasing such services are especially harmful for individuals with disabilities or mobility restrictions. The continued
suspension of the F line and the resulting burden of extended transfer times is significant. This disincentivizes the use of public
transportation, promotes the use of single occupancy vehicles, and increases congestion. In closing, Douglas County is opposed to the
proposed RTD Reimagine System Optimization Plan and respectfully requests that RTD reassess the proposed changes which impact
Douglas County. Feel free to contact any one of us if you have questions or would like to discuss service options for the Douglas County
RTD service area.
The Board of County Commissioners has deep concern regarding the proposed reduction and discontinuation of RTD services within
Douglas County and does not support any reduction in service. Since RTD introduced Reimagine RTD System Optimization Plan service
changes, residents have reached out to voice their concerns. Incremental decreases in RTD services over time have eroded confidence
in RTD as well as the perceived value of tax dollars contributed to RTD. With limited service available in the area, it is disconcerting that
the citizens of Douglas County are potentially losing affordable transportation options and we urge you to reconsider.
Arapahoe Rd is one of the heaviest transit arteries in the county, and Parker Rd is well on its way.
Please build Light Rail at their intersection that goes to downtown and the airport, or at the
very least, connects to other stations to get to downtown and the airport.

Also, I would like to see the 46 Northbound be extended to Colfax. That would help a great deal.

Thank you for your input! RTD exists because of people like you!

Thank you for you input! Route 2 previously ran along Grant/Logan, 6th/8th, Downing/Corona and Speer into Cherry Creek. Ridership
was poor and service was discontinued. The City of Denver's free Chariot service on a similar routing in 2019 also did not draw ridership.

Thank you for your input! Based on your feedback, adjustments were made to Route 402L to operate on weekends in addition to
weekdays. Rail lines E and F were consolidated to improve cost efficiencies and improve service reliability north of I‐25 and Broadway,
where rail service levels were causing rail service delays.

Thank you for your input! Based on your feedback, adjustments were made to Route 402L to operate on weekends in addition to
weekdays. Additionally, the SOP includes an extension of Route 24 through Highlands Ranch to Lincoln Station, operating 7 days a week,
and Route 483 through Parker will have its service span extended and will operate on weekends.

Thank you for your input! The SOP is focused on optimizing RTD's existing services to best meet the current travel needs of the region.
Additional capital expansion was not considered as part of the SOP.
Thank you for your input! Routes 24 and 40 currently operate north‐south on arterials serving this area. Extending Route 46 would
provide duplicate service these routes. RTD will continue monitoring Route 46 to determine if service enhancements should be
considered in the future due to changes in travel demand or land usage. Future changes will be evaluated as part of RTD's existing three‐
times‐per‐year service change process.

40 ‐ On this service I think the wrong approach is being taken ‐ weekday frequency south of Colorado/I‐25 being increased at the
expense of weekend frequencies should be left as a split of 15 minute service north of I‐25, 30 minutes south, with Saturdays at the
same frequency. I'd even look at running Sunday midday on the same pattern. Demand south of I‐25 is markedly lower than north of
there.

Thank you for your input! The SOP is focused on meeting the existing travel needs of as many members of equity communities (i.e., low‐
income and minority) and/or zero car households as possible. To do this, the SOP focused on providing a high frequency of service to
those areas where the highest concentrations of equity community members live or work. In developing the SOP, travel data was
collected anonymously from regional cell phones and tied to census‐block data to identify equity populations and to determine where
they travel the most. This analysis allowed the SOP to identify overall travel needs of equity communities throughout the District.
Additionally, RTD will be incorporating access to major public service destinations and activity centers for future federally‐required Title
VI analyses related to service changes. This is part of RTD's commitment to go above and beyond the Federal Transit Administration's
Title VI requirements.
Thank you for your input! RTD is working to increase the size of our workforce so that in the future we can provide more reliable

Will RTD do a broader analysis on impacts than what is required by Title VI (e.g., related to older people or people with disabilities)?

We appreciate RTD’s goals of developing 10 minute headways for most rail lines. The R line currently runs every 30 minutes, however,
there are multiple cancellations per day that reduce service to hourly or less. Could the R line be extended to serve the Sky Ridge and
RidgeGate stations? Sky Ridge station is home to several large employers.
With a great deal of TOD, mixed‐use and residential development occurring near light rail stations, the City seeks guidance from RTD
regarding best practices to promote access to transit, transit vehicle access to development.
Lone Tree developed Link on Demand free transit service to address demand for services that hour‐long headways on RTD bus services
does not address. Could RTD please consider more of a ‘partnership’ approach with municipalities that are proactively addressing
demand for transit? A cost‐sharing agreement and its structure does not lend itself to problem solving, only the delegation of existing
service needs to address ongoing demand.

Please add a stop for the #11 eastbound after stop #34727 Mississippi and Daliha.
There is not another one for almost a mile. It's very dangerous and I know some with disabilities that have to walk that long stretch to

Thank you for your input! The placement of bus stops depends on many factors such as spacing, right‐of‐way, Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA) accessibility and safety. RTD makes every effort to provide accessible and safe stops where needed, but factors
outside of RTD’s control may limit stop placement. Please contact bus.stop@rtd‐denver.com for inquiries about a specific location.

Route 6: In rush hour, the plan is to bring back 15 minute peak directional service, and in order to do so profitably, my suggestion is to
start service from 9th/Clermont instead of Aurora Metro Center to ensure less operators are needed. If this works, Sunday service
would be easily upgraded to half‐hourly on the 6 to Colorado and buses every 15 minutes all day from 9th/Clermont to Downtown. This
would also more adequately serve the new 9th/Colorado Development.

TWO southbound trips leaving DIA after midnight. Does RTD have ridership numbers to justify the elimination of these trips?
I have previously shared my support for RTD’s draft System Optimization Plan. I think the plan is thoughtful and important step to
shifting priorities from suburban workers commuting downtown to supporting all different types of trips and transit users.
While I think the plan is great overall, I do have one suggestion. Instead of terminating the 24S at the University of Denver light rail
station, I would suggest extending it north to the Cherry Creek shopping center. For example, the 24S could turn around on E 2nd Ave
before continuing back south on University Blvd.
This would extend the overlapping service and 15‐minute headways with the 24N from Hampden Ave to the south to the Cherry Creek
shopping center in the north. I believe this would maintain the service frequency and reliability benefits proposed by truncating the
current 24 bus, while still serving a major employment and economic center in the city.

For the SOP to work, RTD must be focusing on the overall experience of the rider ‐ especially related to seamless transfers, bus shelters

It is obvious that the RTD directors never use the rail lines like a commuter. The elimination of the C & F lines during commuter times
will result in people making transfers at Broadway scrambling to find space on cars. I will admit that currently there should be no issues
and maybe there will never be an issue with people giving up on transit.
As a senior, when my wife and I have attempted a transfer in the past, trains have always been packed at Broadway. Forget about
when events are happening. You may need to wait for two or three trains waiting in the elements. Southbound platform has little
shelter and if you wait on the main platform you risk missing a train if you get blocked by a northbound train.
It's sad RTD directors have used a great idea and service to line your pockets and fail to deliver on the initial plan. Returning service to
85% of pre‐pandemic service by 2027! Ludicrous. Stop throwing good money at a bad product.

Thank you for your input! With regards to elimination of the C and F rail lines, operation of multiple lines north of I‐25/Broadway was

Please maintain the 116x bus route. This is an important route for commuters and those unable to drive or afford to drive (and pay for
parking downtown) this option is critical to continue with the expanding population west of Denver and to reduce additional vehicles on

daily (and would wish it ran on weekends) since I moved west of Denver in ~2013. I and many others rely on this route. Thank you for
considering maintaining this service.

I read in the Denver Post about making comments. My comment is about the Route 10. I was trying to take my two children down to
the aquarium. I had used it in the past and thought it was a great option, it left us near the aquarium previously, probably before the
pandemic. I tried to use it again recently about a month ago and realized the Route 10 no longer goes there. My comment is I would
love if that service was reinstated to the aquarium for the Route 10.

Thank you for your input! Unfortunately, prior to the pandemic, ridership on Route 10 was quite low. The SOP is focused on best
meeting the existing travel needs of the District by restoring service to corridors that exhibit high ridership and serving equity
communities that rely on transit to meet their transportation needs. Therefore, this route was not able to be included.

Living in Highlands Ranch, it would be nice to have more access to the city ‐ either restoring the bus along Wildcat Reserve that goes to
Town Center (if the light rail is ever built to that point), up Broadway, or with a connection to either the Littleton‐Mineral light rail stop
(preferably) would be very helpful. As it currently stands those of us in south Highlands Ranch have little access.

Thank you for your input! The SOP is focused on meeting the existing travel needs of as many people in the District as possible by
balancing the need to restore service to corridors that exhibit high ridership with the need to connect less densely populated areas so
that riders can travel throughout the District. The final SOP includes funding for expansion of FlexRide and Mobility on Demand (MOD)
service areas. RTD will be working directly with local municipalities to identify specific needs and to develop partnerships to expand
FlexRide and MOD service areas as funding and workforce constraints allow.

Centennial has high interest in on‐demand services/partnerships.
We appreciate the 30‐minute service on the east side of the City and the reinstatement of weekend service around Parker. With the
new route splits, it would be good to see some investment in communicating those new transfer points to riders through on‐board
audio announcements, wayfinding signage, and RTDs standard communication channels. (For example, I loved Doug’s idea of switching
from 0B to 0 at Englewood Parkway instead of going out of the way to Englewood Station, but I live in Englewood and probably would
have gone to Englewood Station, as it is a bigger transfer center).

I’m curious if RTD has any data to share about the effectiveness of past route splits. For example, is the 66 operating on time more
frequently than before the service was split into the 66/153? Sharing these reliability benefits with residents would soften concerns
about transfer wait times.

Thank you for your input! The pandemic has adversely impacted commuter ridership for RTD. At this time we believe this area would be
better served by considering new FlexRide/MOD services that connect to RTD fixed route services. RTD will be working directly with
local municipalities to identify specific needs and to develop partnerships to expand FlexRide and MOD service areas as funding and
workforce constraints allow.

Thank you for your input! Route 6 was split into Routes 6 and 19 in April 2016. The on‐time percentage went from 76% for the
combined route to 83% (Route 6) and 77% (Route 19). Also notable that the % late went from 21% to 15‐16%. Use of the specific
example cited (i.e., Route 66) is challenging because the split was not in place very long before the pandemic.

As the C and F Light Rail lines are not reinstated, there will be heavy transfer volumes at the Broadway Station on a permanent basis.

A much better plan would be for the short service of Route 12A to terminate at Broadway Station, following the path currently in use by
Route 11. In real‐world conditions, this would not take significantly more time than the proposed/unworkable routing to/from Alameda
Station. As a benefit, this routing provides a faster transfer (at Louisiana/Pearl) between Route 12 and the Southeast Light Rail lines.

Lone Tree is one of only a few locations that houses an end‐of‐line light rail station, RidgeGate Parkway Station. In recent years, the
Lone Tree Police Department (LTPD) has utilized increasingly greater resources for issues related to the end‐of‐line station, including
high response rates to criminal ac vity, assis ng with RTD Police opera ons, and transpor ng ejected riders to social services.To reduce
some of these end‐of‐line concerns, the City would like to partner with RTD on a police services agreement or other joint effort that
helps define operations where both jurisdictions overlap. We believe a more intentional approach to addressing these issues will result
in greater efficiency across both organizations. LTPD values their good working relationship with RTD and welcomes opportunities to
further support RTD’s personnel and mission.

Here's something that falls under equity that I don't feel is addressed often enough: the ability to be on time to your
particular destination whether you take public transit or drive. If transit doesn't give you comfort to know you will be on

my neighbors imo. But much of Denvers surrounding areas have unreliable transit due to infrequent routes

Administration (FTA) requirements and RTD's Board adopted policies, RTD conducted a Title VI analysis on the final SOP and
found there were no disparate impacts or disproportionate burdens for equity communities. In addition to the federally‐
required Title VI analysis, the SOP was developed to meet the existing travel needs of as many members of equity
communities (i.e., low‐income, minority and/or zero car households) as possible. To do this, the SOP focused on providing
high frequency service to those areas where the highest concentrations of equity community members live or work. As

I agree 100%. Since the BLM riots my family refuses to go to downtown Denver. It is not a safe or friendly place.

We have zero interest in riding RTD light rail from Douglas County to downtown Denver. Colorado's crime rate has risen
24% in the past year. RTD's stations and lines are not safe. Downtown Denver is not safe. We wish we could pull our tax
dollars out of RTD altogether.

Dear RTD,
I’ve been a longtime (&gt;11 yr) commuter on the GS route between Boulder and Golden. I’ve typically taken the GD 3‐4
times/week (round trip). Since the pandemic, I’ve been forced to drive 40+ miles (RT) in a single occupant vehicle at least 2
days per week. These commutes have a severe negative impact on the environment.
