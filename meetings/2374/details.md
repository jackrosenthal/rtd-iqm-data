#### 1. 2016 Salaried Benefit Plans

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors approves the 2016 Plan Year Salaried Benefits plan and authorizes the Interim General Manager and CEO or his designee to enter into agreements with the Insurance Carriers.

Motion:               Director Folska made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the November 17, 2015 Board meeting.

Director Bagley seconded the motion.

Discussion:               Heather Copp, Assistant General Manager for Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer, reviewed the changes for the Medical plans for 2016.  She explained that Cigna administers two self-funded plans: Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) and High-Deductible Health Plan (HDHP), which will see a 7.7% administrative cost increase in 2016.  Kaiser Permanente provides 2 plan options: Deductible Health Maintenance Organization (DHMO) and HDHP, with a blended increase of 5%.  She added that employees will contribute 10% to the PPO and DHMO plans and 5% to the HDHP plans.  She pointed out that the industry standard increase is anywhere from 7% to 10%.

Heather Copp noted that the administrative rates for the dental and vision plans are locked through 2016.  Negotiations will begin early next year for the 2017 rates.  She pointed out that the Basic Life Insurance/AD&D, Voluntary Life/AD&D, and Long and Short Term Disability plans are under a multi-year rate guarantee as well; however, staff anticipates a 3% increase in these plans as they are based on salary dollars for 2016.

She referred the Directors to the chart on page 44 of the Financial Administration and Audit Committee agenda packet for November 10, 2015.  The chart compares the total premium, employee contribution, and RTD contribution for 2015 and 2016 highlighting the dollar amount and percentage of the rate of increase.

Director Lasater asked that the recommended action language read “Interim General Manager” for all recommended actions in an effort to be consistent.

Director Hoy wondered if staff has considered utilizing one provider in order to save in costs.  Heather Copp replied that the single provider option is considered every year; however, she noted that the costs for both Cigna and Kaiser Permanente to RTD and the employees are manageable enough to provide the options.  She added that from past experience in different work settings there are pros and cons to a single provider system.

Committee Chair Tobiassen asked how might employees utilizing the family plans with a child at an out-of-state college be affected if RTD ever assumed a single provider system.  Heather Copp replied that providers have out of network options for those instances.  Committee Chair Tobiassen noted that a transitioning to a single provider system is more complex than it seems.

Committee Chair Tobiassen declared the motion PASSED UNANIMOUSLY.

##### a. 1.a.1 Benefit Plan Contribution Table

#### 2. Approval of 2016 Contribution for the Salaried Employee's Retirement Plans

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors adopt a 2016 contribution of $4.1 million to RTD’s Salaried Employees’ Defined Benefit Pension Trust (the “DB Plan”), which pays a specified monthly benefit at retirement.  It is also recommended that the RTD Board of Directors adopt a 2016 contribution of 9% of each participant’s eligible compensation to the Salaried Employees’ Defined Contribution Plan (the “DC Plan”), which contributes a specified amount to the plan for each year of employment.

Motion:                Director Bagley made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the November 17, 2015 Board meeting.

Director Lasater seconded the motion.

Discussion:               Heather Copp, Assistant General Manager for Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer, explained that the DB plan was closed in 2007.  Employees hired as of January 1, 2008 are on the DC Plan.  The 2016 Actuary recommended contribution for the DB Plan is $6 million.  Staff considers that amount too costly, thus are recommending a $4.1 million annual contribution.  This contribution would project the plan to be fully funded by 2036.  The $4.1 million is included in the 2016 budget.  Heather Copp reminded the Directors that for the DC plan the Board sets the contribution rate between 7% to 9% of salaries per year for participants.  Since its inception, the DC Plan has been funded at 9%.  She referred the Directors to the chart include in theFinancial Administration and Audit Committee agenda packet for November 10, 2015.  The chart includes the percentage of salaries (if applicable), the 2016 projected contribution, the 2015 projected contribution and the projected contribution difference.

Director Archuleta wondered if staff would come back next year and request a different contribution to the DB plan.  Heather Copp explained that the contribution relies on actuarial variation and further changes cannot really be predicted.  She added that the current amount is based on current earnings and salary projections.  She pointed out that the biggest unknown of the DB plan is the life expectancy of those participating in the program.

Director Folska asked for clarification on the 9% contribution for the DC plan.  Heather Copp replied that Board policy calls for a contribution of 7% to 9% of employee’s salaries.  Director Folska wondered what the standard is for agencies similar to RTD, such as Colorado Department of Transportation and the State of Colorado.  Heather Copp said that the percentage varies by employer and budget; however, it is typically between 7% to 9%.  She added it is difficult to compare because the amount of DB plan changes depending on actuary recommendations.

Director Lubow wondered if interest rates went up for the DB plan then the actuary recommended contribution would be less than $6 million.  Heather Copp replied that that was correct and if that happened, it would be a decision for the Board to make in the future as to the contribution.  Director Lubow asked if RTD has a legal obligation to fulfill the DB plan payments.  Heather Copp replied that she would argue that RTD is required to fulfill the benefit offered to those employees.  Rolf Asphaug, Deputy General Counsel, noted that he does not know the legal answer to the question but would agree with Heather Copp in fulfilling the benefits offered.

Committee Chair Tobiassen said that RTD is very fortunate that the DB plan is closed since he knows of too many organizations going bankrupt over their pension funds.

Committee Chair Tobiassen declared the motion PASSED.

##### a. 1.b.1 Amendment 4 to TRUST (00481030)

#### 3. Proposed 2016 Fiscal Policy Statement

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors approves and adopts the 2016 Fiscal Policy Statement.

Motion:               Director Bagley made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the November 17, 2015 Board meeting.

Director Walker seconded the motion.

Discussion:               Jannette Scarpino, Senior Manager for Budget and Financial Analysis, reminded the Directors that towards the end of the year staff brings to the Board the fiscal policy for approval.  She noted that the changes presented were mostly for clarifications.  These changes were summarized in the Board report for the recommended action.  A redlined copy is included in the Financial Administration and Audit Committee agenda meeting packet for November 10, 2015.  She noted that Heather Copp, Assistant General Manager for Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer, would be presenting some proposed language changes based on concerns from Director Menten and Lasater.

Heather Copp referred the Directors to item #2 under Debt Policies.  She noted the addition of the phrase “or a maximum of 40 years.”  She explained that State statutes do not allow the financing of bonds, Certificates of Participation (COPs) or other financial obligations in excess of 40 years.  Staff found it prudent to be clear as per State statute.

Heather Copp added that after a conversation with Director Menten, staff would like to suggest a change of wording on the same item (Debt Policies, #2) from “…shall be financed for a period not to exceed the expected useful life of the asset…” to “not to exceed the lesser of the expected useful life of the asset or a maximum of 40 years.”  She noted that some assets have useful life in excess of 40 years and staff intent is to keep more guard rails on assets that may be utilized for these types of financing.

Director Bagley suggested reviewing item #6 under Revenue Policies to read “On an annual basis, staff will identify underutilized or unutilized property and equipment…” Dave Genova, Interim General Manager and CEO, and Henry Stopplecamp, Acting Assistant General Manager for Capital Programs, had no objection to these additions.

Director Menten agreed with Director Bagley’s suggestion.

Rolf Asphaug, Deputy General Counsel, suggested that modifications that were not supported by the full Board be voted on separately.

Director Lubow wondered why staff crossed out “maintaining or increasing ridership and fare revenue” in item #1 under Revenue Policies.  Heather Copp explained that the bullet points in item #1 were changed to reflect consistency with the recently adopted fare policy.  She noted that it was up to the Directors to decide on the final wording.  Director Lubow said she understood where staff is coming from with those changes; however, she likes the idea of keeping that phrase in.  She noted that item #2 under Revenue Policies eliminated the distinction of riders and included them all under the phrase “all transit dependent patrons.”  Director Lubow pointed out that not everyone using transit is transit dependent.  She wondered if staff used a wider brush than needed on the changes suggested.

Director Lubow asked as to why item #7 under Revenue Policies, which refers to a third party to provide sales and use tax forecasting, was added when this is already occurring.  Heather Copp replied that it was added as this item was a recommended action from the Fiscal Sustainability Task Force and a current practice.  Director Lubow said that she is concerned about the items she mentioned and is inclined to vote no on the 2016 Proposed Fiscal Policy Statement.

Chair Sisk wondered if item #2 under Debt Policies could read “the expected useful life of the asset or a maximum of 40 years, whichever is less.”  Rolf Asphaug replied that Heather Copp’s suggestion, “not to exceed the lesser of the expected useful life of the asset or a maximum of 40 years,” worked well.  Chair Sisk deferred to the Deputy General Counsel’s expertise and withdrew his recommendation.

Motion

to Amend:               Director Menten moved to amend the following items in the Proposed 2016 Fiscal Policy Statement:

- Item #6 under Revenue Policies, “On an annual basis, staff will identify under or unutilized property or equipment, and will make an ongoing attempt to sell such property and equipment to enhance cash flow.”

- Item #2 under Debt Policies, “Capital projects funded through the issuance of bonds, Certificates of Participation (COPs) or other financial obligations shall be financed for a period not to exceed the lesser of the expected useful life of the asset or a maximum of 40 years.”

Director Bagley seconded the motion.

Motion:                Director Folska made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the November 17, 2015 Board meeting.

Director Deadwyler seconded the motion.

Discussion:               Jannette Scarpino, Senior Manager for Budget and Financial Analysis, reminded the Directors that the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) was originally presented in April and approved in August, 2015.  The FasTracks Annual Project Evaluation (APE) was presented in July and approved in August.  During the September Financial Administration and Audit Committee meeting, staff presented an overview of the 2016 Recommended Budget.  The Board studied the 2016 Recommended Budget during the September Study Session.  A budget update was presented during the October Financial Administration and Audit Committee meeting.  Staff’s intent tonight is to move the 2016 Recommended Budget to the full Board meeting on November 17, 2015.

Jannette Scarpino highlighted the following items:

- The District-wide revenue is projected to increase by $141 million including a $39 million increase in Sales & Use Tax.

o        Exhibit I is the Capital Budget

o        Attachment A shows the change details between the posted budget to the recommended budget

o        Attachment B shows the detail of New Capital Projects

o        Attachment C shows the Capital Carry-Forward Expenditures

Director Lubow noted that Sales and Use Tax and Fare Box Revenue is projected to be higher in 2016. She pointed out the projected diesel and gas savings as well.  She wondered if those funds could be used to fund the low income fare program.  Heather Copp, Assistant General Manager for Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer, replied that the Board always has the choice to use the funds however they chose.  In that case, the Board would have to direct staff where to make adjustments to maintain a balanced budget: reduce proposed projects, not make approved allocations, adjust operations, etc., as there is always a tradeoff.  Director Lubow said that she understood.  She wondered what would happen if the Board had a different priority and chose differently.  She said that she would personally prefer to use the increase in revenue to fund low income fares; however, she would not know which items to adjust.

Director Solano pointed out that RTD needs to tighten our belts and come up with some money to help the needy.

Jannette Scarpino pointed out that the revenue will be absorbed in the expense increases for both FasTracks and base operations.

Director Francone noted that she generally agrees with the budget; however, she will be voting no tonight as she still has a few more questions and wants to ensure a conversation during the Board meeting.

Director Bagley reminded the Board to take the estimates in revenue enhancements with a grain of salt.  He noted that currently RTD is not meeting our budget requirements for 2015.  He added that later in the meeting staff will review the 2015 September monthly status which will spell out in more detail the current situation.

Committee Chair Tobiassen pointed out that this is a very complex budget.  He encouraged the Directors to reach out to staff with any questions.  He thanked staff for the annual Herculean task of putting the budget together.

Committee Chair Tobiassen declared the motion PASSED.

##### a. 1.d.1 Board Resolutions 2016 Budget Adoption

##### b. 1.d.2 Exhibit I 2016 Budget

##### c. 1.d.3 Program Capital 2016 Budget

##### d. 1.d.4 Attachment A 2016 Budget

##### e. 1.d.5 Attachments B+C 2016 Budget

#### 5. Electronic Content Management (ECM) Contract

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the Interim General Manager and CEO, or his designee, to execute a contract with IQBG for ECM Owners Representative Services.  The initial contract period will extend through February 28, 2017, with two additional one-year options, and the initial contract amount will be $653,230.  Funding for the initial contract period is included in the 2015 Amended Budget and the 2016 Recommended Budget.

Motion:               Chair Sisk made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the November 17, 2015 Board meeting.

Director Bagley seconded the motion.

Discussion:                Heather Copp, Assistant General Manager for Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer, reviewed the Enterprise Content Management (ECM) Owners Representative Contract Approval presentation as included in the Financial Administration and Audit Committee agenda packet for November 10, 2015.  The presentation included the ECM Project Overview, ECM Owners Representative Overview of Scope, Procurement Process, Contract Structure, Project Cost, Cost of not doing the ECM Project, and Project Schedule.   She highlighted that an ECM system would aid significantly in complying with Colorado Open Records Act (CORA) requests.

Director Folska noted that ECM is really important as IT and security needs to be a priority.  She shared that recently she has been thinking of what RTD does as a technology company which utilizes buses and trains as its main mode of technology.  She asked staff when ECM will be completely implemented.  Heather Copp replied that the plan is for full implementation of the recommendations provided by mid-2019.  She said that the actual date will depend on the actual recommendations, phases of the project, if we decide to convert past data, etc.

Director Folska asked Heather Copp to confirm that as the Assistant General Manager for Finance and Administration she is responsible for Human Resources.  Heather Copp confirmed that she is responsible for Human Resources.  Director Folska wondered how an ECM would aid in investigations when dealing with Equal Employment Opportunity, audits, etc.  Heather Copp replied that an ECM mechanism would make investigations faster and easier while adding extra protection for confidential documents.  She noted that an ECM mechanism would aid in the ability to comply with all Federal and State laws.

Director Menten said that she is a bit uncomfortable with the plan as there are not many specifics.  She wondered if a task force was set up with representatives from different divisions.  She also wondered if property records and the just approved eForce software would be included in the proposed ECM system.  She added that the contract seems to be for a lot of money when there is not a document that spells out what exactly they will be doing.  Heather Copp explained that the contract will not be written until the Board approves moving forward. Staff summarized the scope of work in the presentation as this is now public information.  She noted that RTD has two staff members that work on record management.  The agency does not have the expertise in house to evaluate the full needs for the contract, thus the recommendation to hire an Owners Representative.  She added that staff put together a Steering Committee comprised of the Senior Leadership Team and a Technical Committee with representatives from each department of RTD.

Director Menten asked if ECM would interface with eForce recordings of bus and light rail for safety.  Heather Copp replied that the ECM will categorize the information and pinpoint where it resides and who the owner is.  The ECM will not replace eForce or any other software functionality.  Director Menten wondered if ECM would also cover property records.  Heather Copp said that property records would be searchable under the ECM.  Dave Genova, Interim General Manager and CEO, explained that the goal is for every record in the agency to be covered under the ECM umbrella.  Director Menten requested a copy of the Request for Proposal (RFP) for this project.

Director Lubow said she understood the clear need for fully accessible information; however, she had trouble wrapping her head around the cost: $600,000 for the first year and a total of $11 million in the next years.  Heather Copp replied that the cost is estimated as RTD has not done this kind of project before.  She added that staff looked at the cost of not doing anything, which could cost about $20 million.  She reminded the Directors that the recommended action is to move forward with the creation of the contract.  The contract will be brought to the Directors for approval.  Director Lubow asked what made the cost so high.  Heather Copp explained that any IT implementation is expensive.  She added that doing nothing regarding record management will soon catch up with the agency.  She noted that staff has been lucky to be able to respond to CORA requests.  She pointed out that a CORA requests usually means staff dropping everything they are working on in order to research these documents within the 3 day time frame.  Director Lubow wondered what the cost would be to hire full time employees to deal with these types of research and requests.  Heather Copp explained that even with employees specifically working on these types of research they would still need a system to identify the proper documents.  Director Lubow apologized for belaboring her point.  She found it important to discuss due to the large amount of money requested for the contract.

Director Francone requested a copy of the RFP for this contract.  Heather Copp replied that she would send the copy to the full Board.

Director Francone asked staff to explain the $653,230 request when the budget for the project is $1.8 million.  Heather Copp explained that the $653,230 is the initial contract amount and included in the $1.8 million.  The $1.8 million includes hiring two full time employees and a few other items.  Heather Copp said she can provide the details.

Director Solano expressed his confusion on this project.  He feels like it is taking a step backwards to spend money not knowing the results.  He wondered if a study had been done.  Heather Copp reminded the Directors that in 2014 RTD engaged Ciber to conduct an assessment of ECM at RTD.  Ciber found enough issues in RTD’s ECM that the assessment’s final recommendation was to go out to hire an Owners Representative for the project.  She said that she would get the Board a copy of the Ciber report.  Director Solano had other questions that he would take offline with staff.

Director Walker shared that the company he works at started cataloging all of its holdings, assets, easements, and other documentation 3 years ago and the project is still going.  He noted that it is a very expensive and labor intensive undertaking.  The benefit will be finding the information when needed.  He alluded to Heather Copp’s explanation of the time associated with researching and retrieving documents.  He said that he has been there and spent too much time doing that kind of research.  He noted that he would be supporting the recommended action because the result is worthwhile.

Director Bagley reminded the Directors that in the past Owners Representatives have been hired.  He used hiring Trammell Crow as the Owners Representative for the Denver Union Station (DUS) project as an example.  At the time, RTD did not have the capacity to fulfill all the real estate functions, which is what Trammell Crow was hired to do.  He noted that this is the same conversation for the ECM system.  The $11 million figure will be spent over the next 5 years.  He noted that the Board trusted Trammell Crow to manage the process and the end result is DUS as the hub of the FasTracks program.

Director Bagley asked staff how many CORA requests RTD gets in a month and who requests them.  Dave Genova replied that there are anywhere from six to twelve a month.  He said that the requestors come from all over the board: media, individuals, response to accidents/incidents, etc.  Rolf Asphaug, Deputy General Counsel, noted that it could be a few more than that depending on the time frame.  Some requests are really large.  He added that an ECM system will provide a guarantee of consistent information.  He pointed out that the General Counsel supports this initiative.

Committee Chair Tobiassen recalled when the Board used to get the Board packets delivered by courier on Friday afternoons.  He said that he would save them in case he needed to reference them.  Due to the stacks of documents he knows he would never be able to find anything.  He noted that even with the current electronic system, he still needs to remember the date in order to search for a specific document.  He added that an ECM would help in the search as it would use keywords, topics, contractors, and other information as needed.

Director Menten wondered if RTD used Optical Character Recognition (OCR).  Rolf Asphaug replied that OCR is used with Adobe documents for searches.

Director Lasater explained that the ECM is kind of like a jukebox: you push the items you want to grab and it retrieves it for you.  He added that audio and video files are huge and knowing where they are at is a great asset.  He noted that the current record system is dysfunctional.  He added that to use a cloud based system would be really expensive for the amount of files that RTD stores.  Heather Copp added that the ECM system would eliminate the need for duplication of documents, thus freeing up more space.

Director Folska called for the question.

Committee Chair Lasater declared the motion PASSED.

##### a. 1.e.1 ECM Owners Rep Board 111015

#### 1. Third Quarter 2015 Investment Report

Brenden Morgan, Senior Manager for Debt and Investments, noted that not much has changed since the last quarter.  He pointed out that the Liquidity Tier and the Enhanced Cash Tier are in line, if not outperforming, the benchmarks.

Director Hoy recalled the process of refinancing bonds that was done several years ago.  He wondered if it would make sense to refinance bonds again.  Brenden Morgan explained that in 2013 RTD did three refinancings of outstanding debt in order to create some repayment capacity for the North Metro line.  He added that staff always looks at the outstanding debt portfolio in order to find all the opportunities available when going to the market.  At this time staff is not recommending any refinancing.  Director Hoy pointed out that there is no way of predicting the need for refinancing as it is a money market situation.  Brenden Morgan agreed saying that was a big portion of it.  He added that particular bonds need to wait until a particular date in order to be refinanced.

#### 2. SmartCard Project Update

Heather Copp Assistant General Manager for Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer, informed the Directors that the internal testing has gone very well.  She noted that we are on target for the January 1, 2016 Stored Value public pilot to go live.  She reviewed the following changes to the SmartCard project elements:

- External Hosting of SMT environment – changed to yellow from green due to Xerox needing to update the Java based web application development program in order to conform to security requirements.

- ADA Reviews – changed to yellow from green due to delays in testing because of a web portal issue.

Heather Copp added that the next assessment will be presented to the Assistant General Managers on Friday November 20th.  After that meeting staff will have a much better feel about the success of a January implementation.  She added that staff will continue the monthly updates through the public pilot phase.

Director Lubow noted we are only going live with the public pilot in January.  She asked when it would be available to the full public.  Heather Copp replied that the public pilot is a public phasing as participants will be using their own money.  Staff would like to see how SmartCard usage goes beyond staff and Directors, since we are more familiar with using public transit than the general public.  This would allow staff to address any issues that may emerge.  Currently staff does not have a good date for full public implementation; staff would like to see how the public pilot goes before deciding on a public roll out date.

Chair Sisk expressed his dissatisfaction with the update.  He noted that if we are not ready for implementation by January 1st, like he was expecting, that we go ahead and say it.

#### 3. September 2015 Monthly Financial Status Report

Heather Copp Assistant General Manager for Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer, recalled Director Bagley’s comments during the 2016 Recommended Budget discussion.  She noted that between Fare Box Revenue and Sales and Use Tax, we are $5 million to $6 million under budget.  She added that numbers have been slightly better, ironically, from new and used car sales.

Doug MacLeod, Controller, reviewed the September 2015 Monthly Financial Status.  He noted that most items are in red, alluding to Director Bagley’s comments during the 2016 Recommended Budget discussion, adding that in order to keep the budget balanced adjustments need to be made to expenses accordingly.

Heather Copp pointed out that staff continues to monitor expenditures.

Director Lubow wondered how worrisome is the September 2015 Monthly Financial Status.  Heather Copp replied that the last couple of months have been close to expectations.  She noted that the decreases have been leveling off and staff is able to cover those shortfalls by monitoring expenditures.  She added that staff is still cautious of 2016.  The University of Colorado’s Leeds School of Business is expecting an increase in Sales and Use Tax.  Staff will continue to monitor on a monthly basis and see how the fare increases and the openings of the lines affect the bottom line.  She mentioned that staff will continue to be diligent in reporting to the Directors the forecasts as well as bringing to the Board’s attention any trends that staff may see.

##### a. 093015 RTD MFS Final

### D. Other Matters

Dave Genova, Interim General Manager and CEO, updated the Directors on the North Metro Project.  RTD has the option with the Regional Rail Partners (RRP) to execute a design/build for North Metro to end of line until December 31, 2015.  Staff has been working with the RRP to get pricing for a contract extension until December 31, 2016.  Staff has just received the numbers.  They will be shared at the North Metro Elected Officials meeting on November 12, 2015.  He added that staff wanted to share the information with the Directors before going public.

Henry Stopplecamp, Acting Assistant General Manager for Capital Programs, informed the Directors that the cost to exercise a continuation until December 31, 2016 from 124th Avenue to 168th Avenue/HWY 7 is $263 million.  This breaks down to $153 million to RRP and $110 million in costs to RTD, for items such as right of way and other expenditures.  The price to exercise a continuation from 124th Avenue to 144th Avenue is $181 million.

Director Hoy asked for the breakdown of the $181 million to 144th Avenue.  Henry Stopplecamp replied that the cost would be $91 million to RRP and $90 million in costs to RTD.  He added that the $90 million covers new vehicles, stations, and other details that he could give offline.  Director Hoy asked what the cost would be to exercise the continuation to HWY 7 today.  Henry Stopplecamp replied that the cost to exercise the continuation today is $79 million.  Dave Genova added that the $79 million is the RRP number; there would still be RTD costs.

Director Bagley asked for the difference in RRP costs.  Henry Stopplecamp replied that the cost for 2015 is $79 million and the cost for 2016 is $153 million, almost doubling RRP’s cost.  Director Bagley noted that the $74 million difference is a big number.

Director James informed the Directors that he attended the Rail~Volution conference in Dallas at the end of October.  Also in attendance were Directors Bagley and Walker.  He reminded the Directors of how beneficial these types of conference are and encouraged them to take advantage of these opportunities.

Director James said that he recently had the privilege of meeting with Don Hunt, former Executive Director for the Colorado Department of Transportation, Kelly Brough, President and CEO of the Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce, Chair Sisk and Dave Genova.  He notified the Directors that the Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce is in the beginning stages of something they are calling “Choice Mobility”.  The project will look at ways to integrating transit options within the region and with other organizations.

Director Folska asked Dave Genova to give the Directors a date for the launch of the safety campaign.  Dave Genova replied that there is no firm date as staff is still working with authorities regarding the most recent light rail accident.  Director Folska asked how the safety campaign and the light rail accident are related.  Dave Genova replied that staff is not sure if there will be charges filed until Douglas County is done with their investigation.  Director Folska noted that the safety campaign is geared towards children’s safety around transit and in conjunction with the new openings.  Dave Genova pointed out that the subject matter in the campaign may seem somewhat insensitive due to the recent fatality.  He added that the safety campaign is a stand-alone campaign around multi modal transit that will engage many different audiences.  Director Folska wondered if December 1st is a possible date.  Dave Genova replied that December 1st is a possibility.

Committee Chair Tobiassen thanked Veteran’s for their service and acknowledged the luncheon RTD held today for Veterans that work at the agency.
