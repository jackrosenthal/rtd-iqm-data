BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

2016 Salaried Benefit Plans

CFO/AGM,

Finance

&

Board Meeting Date: November 17, 2015

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approves the 2016 Plan Year Salaried Benefits plan and authorizes the General Manager/CEO or his
designee to enter into agreements with the Insurance Carriers.
BACKGROUND
Annually the staff brings the proposed Salaried Employee Benefits plan for approval to the Board of
Directors. Approval of the plan by the Board establishes the rates for Open Enrollment and provides
costs for the 2016 Budget. The Open Enrollment period for salaried staff begins November 15 through
November 29, 2015.
DISCUSSION
The goals for the 2016 plan year are: 1) Achieve the 2016 budget goals, 2) Continued focus on
containing cost and emphasis on improving health and wellness consumerism, 3) Maintain market
competitiveness, and 4) Insure compliance with PPACA – Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
(Health Care Reform provisions as applicable to RTD).
Following is a summary of the modest changes for the 2016 plan year.
Medical
- Cigna administers two self-funded plans on behalf of RTD. Both the PPO Plan and the HDHP (High
Deductible Health Plan) Plan have a specific individual $150,000 stop-loss ceiling in 2016. The
administrative cost will increase by 7.7% in 2016. The Cigna Plans are estimated to have
approximately 506 employees enrolled. 2015 claims are running at expected claims YTD and 2016
claims are currently projected to be slightly higher than 2015 levels.
-

Kaiser provides 2 Plan Options: a DHMO (HMO Plan with deductibles), and a HDHP. The Kaiser
plans are estimated to have approximately 209 employees enrolled. This plan has proposed a 5%
blended increase over 2015.

-

The employee cost share for 2016 will be 10% for the Cigna PPO and Kaiser DHMO plans and 5%
for the Cigna HDHP and Kaiser HDHP plans.

-

Cigna has agreed to provide $15,000 to our wellness program in 2016.

Dental
- No carrier/plan changes and a 0% renewal rate increase, we are currently in an Administrative rate
guarantee through 2016. Claims have held steady this year so we anticipate this will continue in

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

2016.
Life & Disability
-

Basic Life Insurance/AD&D, Voluntary Life/AD&D, Long and Short Term Disability are under a multiyear rate guarantee; however we have anticipated a 3% increase in these plans based on increase in
salary dollars for 2016. Life Insurance and LTD premiums are salary based.

Vision/Business Travel Accident
- Vision Plan is currently a fully insured plan with Anthem Blue Cross – Blue Shield. A rate guarantee
is in effect through 2016 so there will be no increase in premium.
-

We are currently in the renewal stage for the organization’s Business Travel Accident insurance; I do
not expect an increase in premium as there have been no claims on the insurance in 2015.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The 2016 planned Salaried Employee Insured Benefit budget is projected to be a 5% increase over 2015
projected benefit costs. RTD’s current utilization and projections are below the medical trend of 8.6%.
With the additional costs associated with the Affordable Care Act, the overall benefit budget increase is
projected to be 5% over 2015.
The major cost impacts in 2016 are due to Cigna Plan increases of 7.7%. The net additional benefit
costs anticipated in 2016 are essentially flat. Reduction in the Transitional Reinsurance fees and rate
guarantees are responsible for results of an approximate overall 5% increase over last year. This is the
sixth year we have achieved strong cost containment as a result of our shift in carriers, plan offerings,
plan design and funding models.
The 2016 estimate of the Salaried Employee Insured Benefits is $10,783,499. The projected increase
of 5% results in an increase of a projected $547,768 in 2016. The increase meets the projected costs in
the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP). Statewide, average healthcare insurance is expected to increase seven
percent in 2016.

ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors approve the 2016 Plan Year Salaried Benefits plan and authorize the General Manager
or his designee to enter into agreements with the Insurance Carriers.
2. Further modify the salaried employee benefit plans to be offered in 2016. This is not
recommended since it would require additional negotiations with benefit providers and delay
the employee enrollment period.
3. Do not approve the recommended salaried employee benefit plans. This is not recommended, as
this will result in the Agency being unable to provide competitive and cost effective benefit
plans to the salaried employees.

Approval of 2016 Contribution for the Salaried
Employee's Retirement Plans

CFO/AGM,

Finance

&

Board Meeting Date: November 17, 2015

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
adopt a 2016 contribution of $4.1 million to RTD’s Salaried Employees’ Defined Benefit Pension Trust
(the “DB Plan”), which pays a specified monthly benefit at retirement. It is also recommended that the
RTD Board of Directors adopt a 2016 contribution of 9% of each participant’s eligible compensation to
the Salaried Employees’ Defined Contribution Plan (the “DC Plan”), which contributes a specified amount
to the plan for each year of employment.
BACKGROUND
In December, 2007, the RTD Board of Directors closed the DB Plan to new employees with new
employees hired on January 1, 2008 and later participating in the DC Plan. From January 1, 2008 to
December 31, 2012 both the DB and DC Plan had been funded on a 9% of salaries basis.
DISCUSSION
DB Plan
In 2012, the Board of Directors agreed that beginning in 2013, annual contributions to the DB Plan
would be made at a fixed annual amount of $3.1 million rather than as a percentage of salaries as a
result of the actuary’s recommendation at that time. The fixed annual contribution of $3.1 million to the
DB Plan was determined by the plan’s actuaries to be the annual contribution necessary to maintain a
“fully funded” status for the plan in the future.
The actuaries have updated the DB Plan projections to reflect the final 1/1/2015 valuation assumptions
for the DB Plan. The 2016 Actuary recommended contribution is $6 million. The $6 million contribution
would continue through 2020 decreasing to $5.1 million in 2021 and then $3.1 million thereafter until
100% funding is reached in 2034. This option has been deemed too costly to fund at this time.
The recommendation is to increase the annual fixed contribution by $1 million to $4.1 million. If this is
done for 2016 and beyond, it is projected that the plan would be 100% funded by 2036.
If the existing $3.1 million contribution is maintained, the plan is not expected to reach 100% funding
until long after 2036 which is outside of the 20 year goal to have the plan 100% funded.

Packet Pg. 7

1.B.2

DC Plan
Section 4.1 of the RTD Salaried Employees’ DC Plan adopted by the RTD Board provides that the
Employer may, at its sole discretion, set a contribution rate between 7 to 9% per year for participants.
The contribution rate has been 9% each year to the DC Plan from 2008 through 2015.

The assumed contributions indicate the different amounts that would be required to fund the plan at
9%, 8% and 7% of eligible salaries in 2016.

ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors adopts a 2016 contribution of $4.1 million to RTD’s Salaried Employees’ Defined
Benefit Pension Trust (the “DB Plan”), which pays a specified monthly benefit at retirement. It is
also recommended that the RTD Board of Directors adopt a 2016 contribution of 9% of each
participant’s eligible compensation to the Salaried Employees’ Defined Contribution Plan (the “DC
Plan”), which contributes a specified amount to the plan for each year of employment. These
amounts have been included in the 2016 Recommended Budget.
2. The RTD Board of Directors could certify an amount to be contributed to the RTD Salaried
Employees’ Defined Benefit Pension Trust or the RTD Salaried Employees’ Defined Contribution
Plan at amounts other than $4.1 million and 9%, respectively.
3. Do not authorize a contribution to the RTD Salaried Employees’ Pension Plans. This is not
recommended because the DB Plan’s funding status would deteriorate and the liability would
increase.

Proposed 2016 Fiscal Policy Statement

CFO/AGM,

Finance

&

Board Meeting Date: November 17, 2015

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approves and adopts the 2016 Fiscal Policy Statement.
BACKGROUND
Proposed modifications to the Fiscal Policy Statement (the “Policy”) are brought to the Board of
Directors for approval during the year, as necessary. In addition, each year staff presents the
proposed Policy for the upcoming fiscal year for approval to the Board of Directors as an initial step
in development of the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) and Recommended Budget.
The most recent modification to the Policy was approved by the Board of Directors in October 2014
for the 2015 fiscal year. Those changes primarily related to clarifying that 1) the fund balance is
maintained to meet not only unanticipated expenditures and increases in costs, but also to mitigate
service disruptions as a result of economic downturns affecting revenue, and 2) the budget is
prepared using Generally Accepted Accounting Principles excluding the non-cash portion of long-term
unfunded pension accruals. The Policy Statement was also updated with the most recent rating
agency credit ratings at the time.
DISCUSSION
For 2016, the following major changes are proposed.
Revenue Policies #1 is amended to add the following in accordance with the objectives of the revised
fare schedule in 2016: “As part of this process, staff will review potential fare adjustments to
establish a fare structure to ensure that it: is understandable, is implementable, is equitable,
achieves revenue levels established in the Strategic Budget Plan, and facilitates the integration of the
2016 rail and BRT projects.” (amendment in italics)
Revenue Policies #7 is added as follows: “RTD will contract with a qualified third party to provide
sales and use tax forecasting containing projections for the short-term (one year by quarter),
medium-term (six year SBP period) and long-term (30-year APE period). The purpose is to provide
RTD with expert economic analysis and sales and use tax forecasts using sophisticated financial
modeling techniques not available internally.”
Expenditure Policies #5 is amended to add the following: “RTD will invest in a safety outreach
programs and personnel to communicate safety messages.” (amendment in italics)

Packet Pg. 11

1.B.3

Capital Improvement Policies #1 last bullet point is amended to add the following: “RTD mission
statement elements, Board strategic goals, and other relevant criteria.” (amendment in italics)
Debt Policies #2 is amended as follows: “Capital projects funded through the issuance of bonds,
Certificates of Participation (COPs) or other financial obligations shall be financed for a period not to
exceed the expected useful life of the asset or a maximum of 40 years.” (amendment in italics)
Debt Policies #4 is amended as follows: “Before long-term debt is issued, the impact of debt service
on total annual expenditures and the net revenue coverage ratio will be analyzed.” (amendment in
italics)
Budget Policies #2 is deleted; the relevance of budgeting on a program/project basis has diminished.
The Policy Statement is updated with the most recent rating agency credit ratings in effect at this
date.
All other proposed changes to the Policy Statement are primarily wording clarification and are
reflected in the attachment.
Please see the attachment for the full proposed document with changes indicated.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Adopting the Fiscal Policy Statement as requested will not have a financial impact on the 2016
Recommended Budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Approve the recommended changes to RTD’s 2016 Fiscal Policy Statement. Staff supports
this alternative because the Policy Statement documents the policies to be adhered to in 2016
and provides clarification of certain practices.
2. Board further modifies the recommended changes. Staff reviewed the fiscal policies and
welcomes any suggestions for modifications requested by the Board of Directors.
3. Do not adopt the RTD 2016 Fiscal Policy Statement. This is not recommended because
RTD’s Fiscal Policy Statement would not contain all current language, would not adhere to
best practices, and would not best facilitate the needs of RTD’s financial operations.

REVENUE POLICIES
1. Staff will plan fare adjustments every 3 years in the mid and long-term budgets to
adjust for inflation. The Board of Directors may consider potential fare adjustments
annually at the time of the development of the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP). As
part of this process, staff will review potential fare adjustments to establish a fare
structure with due consideration forto ensure that it:
 consistency and equity throughout RTD;is understandable
 ease of use and simplicity;is implementable
 maintaining or increasing ridership and fare revenues;is equitable
 acceptability and marketability of fare structure to customers and the general
public;achieves revenue levels established in the Strategic Budget Plan, and
 verification and enforceability of fare payment compliancefacilitates the
integration of the 2016 rail and BRT projects.
2. Fare policies will take into account the special needs of all transit dependent,
elderly, youth, student, handicapped, and commuter patrons.
3. RTD will avoid dependence on temporary revenues to fund ongoing services. Onetime revenues will be used for one-time expenditures.
4. RTD will continuously explore additional sources of revenue to help balance the
budget.
5. When appropriate the Board will actively pursue legislation that would help ensure
the continued accomplishment of RTD’s goals and mission statement. The Board
will support efforts to ensure that legislative intent is realized in allocation of state
financial resources to public transit. The Board will actively oppose legislation that
would limit or diminish revenue.
6. On an annual basis, Sstaff will identify on an annual basis excessunutilized
property and equipment, and will make an ongoing attempt to sell such excess
property and equipment to enhance cash flow.

CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT POLICIES
1. On an annual basis, RTD will prepare and update annually a six-year Strategic
Budget Plan (SBP) including projected capital construction and improvements,
service levels, and operating costs, and revenues to fund the capital and operating
programs. Capital projects to be included in the SBP will be evaluated using the
following criteria:
 total project cost (design and construction) and schedule for completion;
 source of funding;
 operating and maintenance costs for the remainder of the SBP period;
 benefits and contributions to RTD and the community, including but not limited
to the effect on future operating and maintenance costs, economy, service, and
ridership;
 consideration of alternatives (joint development, etc.); consequences of not
funding; and
 RTD mission statement elements, Board strategic goals, and other relevant
criteria..
2. Priority will be given to replacement of existing assets before consideration of new
assets except as allowed for in the FasTracks financial plan (see #7 below.).
3. RTD will use the first year capital program from the adopted SBP as the basis for
the capital program to be included in the annual budget.
4. After completion of design of a capital project, cost estimates will be revised. If
the cost estimates exceed Delegation of Authority limits, the project will be
brought to the Board for reconsideration.
5. Facilities will be designed using current technology and allow for future
technological changes in order to be efficient and cost-effective and to protect the
public welfare.
6. RTD shall allow for multi-year capital projects to be carried forward in accordance
with the carry-forward resolution adopted by the Board.
7. RTD will prepare an annual update of the FasTracks financial plan incorporating the
actual costs incurred and the most recent available projections of capital
improvement costs, service levels, and operating costs and revenues to fund the
FasTracks capital and operating programs.

Attachment: 1.c.1 2016 Fiscal Policy Statement lined (2574 : Proposed 2016 Fiscal Policy Statement)

FUND BALANCE POLICIES
1. RTD will strive to maintain a fund balance in the Base System and in the FasTracks
operating budget, to provide for unanticipated expenditures of a nonrecurring
nature, to meet unexpected increases in costs or to mitigate service disruptions as
a result of economic downturns affecting revenue. This unrestricted fund balance
will be comprised of a Board appropriated fund, a capital replacement fund and an
undesignated working capital fund as described below. For the Base System, the
total of these three funds should be maintained at an amount approximately equal
to three months of Base System operating expenses excluding depreciation. For
FasTracks, the total of these three funds should be maintained at an amount
approximately equal to two months of FasTracks operating expenses excluding
depreciation. RTD will consider and pursue resources that will be directed to fund
balance replenishment. For example, RTD may define the revenue sources that
would typically be looked to for replenishment of fund balance to include nonrecurring revenues and budget surpluses. Year-end surpluses are an especially
appropriate source for replenishing fund balance.
RTD will replenish fund balances as soon as economic conditions allow.
2. In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will designate a Board appropriated
fund balance on an annual basis. Use of the fund balance will be minimized and
occur only in specific circumstances such as severe economic downturns. With
Board approval, these funds may be used to avoid cash flow interruptions, reduce
the need for short-term borrowing, and assist in maintaining an investment-grade
bond rating. The source of replenishment of this fund will be identified and will
take place in a prompt manner.
3. In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will designate a capital replacement
fund on an annual basis. With Board approval, these funds will be used for
scheduled major vehicle replacements and other capital purchases. The source of
replenishment of this fund will be identified and will take place in a prompt manner.
4. RTD will designate excess and undesignated working capital that may accrue at
each year-end to be placed in an unrestricted fund to be used to respond to
unanticipated events.
5. RTD will maintain an emergency (TABOR) reserve equal to three percent of nonFederal revenues, as specified by Article X, Section 20 of the Colorado
Constitution.
6. The Board shall establish three reserves for future construction under the
FasTracks plan:



The FasTracks Contingency Reserve will be appropriated at a sufficient level of
$30 million each year. These funds will be available to fund adjustments to the
FasTracks construction schedule, relating to logistics or cost savings
opportunities that might arise after the annual budget is adopted, and will not
be used to fund the (non-FasTracks) Base System capital or operating activity.
The FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) will be used to provide funding
for future FasTracks projects that are currently unfunded. Expenditures from
the FISA will be subject to Board approval with the staff recommended project
goals identified in the Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM). Funding of the FISA will be
provided from the sources identified in the Board approved RAM and other
sources approved by the Board.
All other FasTracks funds which have not been appropriated, or otherwise
designated as reserved, in the current budget year will be maintained in a
reserve for future FasTracks capital and operating expenditures and will not be
used to fund the (non-FasTracks) Base System expenditures.

1.B.4

DISCUSSION
The total proposed current year appropriation for the 2016 Recommended Budget (combined
Base and FasTracks) is $2,537.0 million. This includes an operating expense budget of $635.4
million, interest expense of $117.3 million, capitalized interest of $33.0 million, new capital
expenditures of $484.9 million, debt payments of $61.7 million, FasTracks contingency reserve
of $15.9 million, FasTracks Internal Savings Account of $23.5 million, Board appropriated fund
of $35.0 million, capital replacement fund of $27.3 million, and estimated unrestricted fund
balance of $15.8 million. The previously approved capital (capital carry forward) is $1,087.2
million. The sum of the budget appropriation and capital carry forward is $2,537.0 million.
Overview of the 2016 RTD Recommended Budget
Revenues of $1,121.7 million on a combined basis are expected to increase $141.1 million
(14.4%) in 2016 from the 2015 Amended Budget. The increase is due to 1) an increase in fare
revenue of $34.7 million, 2) an increase in sales/use tax revenue of $39.1 million, and 3) an
increase in grant revenue of $69.6 million, and 4) an increase in other income of $0.7 million,
offset by a decrease in investment income of $3.1 million.







Combined (Base System and FasTracks) farebox revenues of $158.1 million are budgeted
to increase 28.1% over the 2015 Amended Budget. On the Base System, fare revenue is
budgeted to increase 10% in alignment with the new fare structure in 2016; however,
ridership growth is expected to be flat to minimal. For FasTracks, farebox revenue is
budgeted to increase $22.8 million over the 2015 Amended Budget to $26.8 million due
to the opening of five new service lines (I-225, US36 BRT, East, Gold, and Northwest Rail
electrified segment). The FasTracks estimate is per the Annual Program Evaluation.
Sales and use tax revenues of $590.5 million in 2015 are expected to increase 8.0% over
the 2015 projected level according to the most recent September quarterly forecast by
the CU-Leeds School of Business.
Total Base System grants are projected to increase $8.5 million over the 2015 Amended
Budget, including new and carry forward amounts. Base System grants are estimated to
total $115.2 million in 2016; of that amount, $87.2 million is new grants while projected
carryforward grant funding is $28.0 million. FasTracks grants are budgeted to increase
$61.1 million from the 2015 Amended Budget due primarily to an estimated $58.2 million
New Starts grant for the Southeast Rail extension, as well as increases in CMAQ-Eagle
and US36 FASTER grants.
Investment income is budgeted to decrease $3.1 million from continued low short term
interest rates coupled with deployment of invested funds. Other income will remain
largely flat, increasing at the CPI or as identified.

Operating expenditures are budgeted at $635.4 million on a combined basis in 2016 (excluding
depreciation), which is $79.9 million higher compared to the 2015 Amended Budget. The
increase is due to: 1) budgeting for the DTO service payment of $57.1 million for the first time in
2016, 2) one-time costs of approximately $4.3 million for the Grand Opening activities for the
new FasTracks service lines, 3) cost allocation for the new service lines in 2016, 4) increased
contributions totaling $2.5 million to the salaried and union pension and benefit plans, 5)
additional operator shift differential pay and pay for split shifts totaling approximately $3.3
million, and 6) the expense project carryforward totaling $51.7 million. The expense project
carryforward to 2016 is $15.9 million for Base System operations and $35.9 million for

Packet Pg. 27

1.B.4

FasTracks. It should be noted that substantial reductions were made to departmental operating
budgets to align them with the SBP target, which offset the above increases over 2015.
Diesel fuel is budgeted at the lock price of $2.23 per gallon, compared to a price of $2.95 per
gallon in the 2015 Amended Budget, for savings of $7.5 million. Gasoline is budgeted at
$3.00/gallon, down from the 2015 per gallon budget price of $3.40, for savings of $630,000.
The major changes in operating expenses comparing the Recommended Budget to the posted
Requested Budget are shown in Attachment A. The majority of the changes from the Requested
Budget consist of the expense projects carry-forward.
Interest expense in 2016 is budgeted at $117.3 million on a combined basis, an increase of
$21.9 million over the 2015 Amended Budget. The increase is due to the issuance of COP debt
in 2015 and anticipated debt issuances in 2016. Of total interest expense, $27.3 million is
budgeted for Base System and $90.0 million is budgeted for FasTracks. Capitalized interest
(combined) is budgeted at $33.0 million, the majority of which will occur in FasTracks Project.
Capitalized interest will be part of the actual cash outlay for interest payments in 2016.
Principal payments on debt are estimated at $61.7 million on a combined basis, which is $2.8
million higher than the 2015 Amended Budget. Base System principal payments of $51.9 million
are $1.9 million higher due to scheduled amortization of the COPs issued for fleet purchases (bus
and rail). FasTracks principal payments of $9.8 million are $0.8 million higher due to issuance of
COPs and scheduled principal amortization on current debt. Financing proceeds from the
issuance of new debt is budgeted at $150.0 million in new bond funds for capital program
construction for FasTracks (mainly the Southeast Rail extension). No debt issuances are planned
for the Base System. Such financing proceeds are budgeted to be $179.1 million lower from the
2015 Amended Budget because both entities will supplement debt issuance by drawing from
previously issued debt to fund major capital purchases and construction in 2016.
Capital expenditures are comprised of both the capital carry-forward from 2015 (previously
approved capital) arising from timing of project completion, and new capital for 2016. The
capital carry-forward will be $1,087.2 million made up of $178.0 million on the Base System
and $909.2 million on FasTracks.
New capital spending on a combined basis of $484.9 million will decrease $169.9 million from
the 2015 Amended Budget due mainly to project completion in FasTracks. New capital spending
for FasTracks will decrease $174.3 million to $373.3 million in 2016 due to on-going project
completion on the East Line, US36 BRT, and Northwest Rail, offset by increases to the
Southeast Extension and I-225. For the Base System, new capital spending will increase $4.4
million to $111.6 million. Of this amount, the Base system will spend $0.1 million more on Parkn-Rides, and $39.4 million more on fleet modernization/expansion (bus and rail). These increases
will be offset by $4.1 million less on facilities construction and maintenance (primarily Civic
Center), $0.5 million less on bus infrastructure (local government requests), $16.5 million less in
capital support projects (primarily IT support for the District), and $13.8 million less on Rail
transit (project completion). The Base System new capital was approved as part of the Strategic
Budget Plan in August 2015.
New capital expenditures for 2016 and the change in new capital in the 2016 Recommended
Budget over the previous 2015 Requested Budget/Strategic Budget Plan are shown in
Attachment B. The capital carry-forward expenditures for 2016 and the change in the capital

1.B.4

carry-forward in the 2016 Recommended Budget over the 2015 Amended Budget are shown in
Attachment C.
Notable designated fund balance changes include a decrease of $3.5 million in the Base System
year-end unrestricted fund balance from the 2015 Amended Budget to $6.5 million. This
projected fund balance is still $1.3 million higher than the SBP target of $5.2 million after
incorporating all revenue and expense adjustments. The actual amount realized, however, may
be lower than the projected $6.5 million due to possible slippage in fare revenue and sales tax
revenue in 2015 (this will become evident in the 2016 amended budget). Also on the Base
System, the Board-appropriated fund is projected to increase by $3.0 million to $25.2 million,
and the capital replacement fund is projected to increase by $3.0 million to $18.0 million.
On a District-wide basis, the unrestricted fund balance is projected to decrease $0.2 million from
the 2015 Amended Budget to $15.8 million. The $3.5 million decrease in the Base System’s
unrestricted fund balance is offset by an increase of $3.3 million on FasTracks. On a Districtwide basis, the Board-appropriated fund and the capital replacement fund are projected to
increase by $13.1 million in total. These increases are in minimum accordance with fiscal
policies for each of the District entities (Base System, FasTracks Projects, and FasTracks
Operations) per Fund Balance Policy below.
The FasTracks Construction Reserve at $81.3 million is split between the Construction Reserve
at $56.3 million and a Start-up Operations Reserve at $25.0 million. The Start-up Operations
Reserve was established in the FasTracks Annual Program Evaluation for the years 2015-2016 in
order to meet the 1.2x debt service coverage if needed. These balances reflect draws totaling
$18.7 million for FasTracks continuing construction.
The FasTracks Contingency Reserve will be maintained at a balance of $15.9 million in the 2016
Budget, net of a drawdown of $14.1 million for North Metro construction.
Cost Recovery Ratio
The 2016 Recommended Budget meets the cost recovery ratio mandated by the Colorado
General Assembly. The estimated SB 154 recovery ratio (all non-tax revenue except ADA
farebox revenues divided by all expenditures, including depreciation, except ADA expenditures
and expenditures incurred for long-term planning and development of rapid transit infrastructure)
exceeds the annual target of 30% mandated by the General Assembly.
Fund Balance Policy
The Fund Balance Policy for 2016 requires fund balances to consist of a Board-appropriated
fund, a capital replacement fund, and an undesignated working capital fund (the remaining
unrestricted year-end fund balance) for both the Base System and FasTracks. The objective is
for the total of these three funds to equal approximately three months of operating expenses
excluding depreciation for the Base System and two months of same for FasTracks. The 2016
budget reflects continued maintenance of the FasTracks contingency reserve at a level deemed
sufficient to fund adjustments to the FasTracks construction schedule.
The total of these unrestricted fund balances for 2016 on a District-wide basis is projected at
$78.1 million, comprised of 1) the Board appropriated fund of $35.0 million, 2) the capital
replacement fund of $27.3 million, and 3) an undesignated working capital fund or remaining

Packet Pg. 29

1.B.4

fund balance of $15.8 million. The Base System portion of the three fund balances for 2016 is
projected to total $49.7 million.
Basis of Accounting Used in Budgeting
The accounts of the District are reported using the GAAP accrual basis of accounting with two
exceptions:





Capital outlays and payments of bond principal are treated as expenditures.
Gains and losses on disposal of property and equipment are excluded.
The non-cash portion of the long-term unfunded pension accrual is excluded.
Asset sale proceeds and debt issuance proceeds are included.
Attachments

As noted above, please refer to the attached Fiscal Year 2016 Recommended Budget and Fiscal
Year 2016 Recommended Budget-Fund Balance (Exhibit I) which shows the operating/nonoperating sources, debt and reserves, and capital sources as well as operating uses, capital
expenditures, and fund balances of the District, and a reconciliation of net assets. Also attached
is the Program Capital Summary including previously approved capital, an Operating Budget
Changes Since Posted Budget summary (Attachment A), a New Capital Projects summary
(Attachment B), and Capital Carryforward Expenditures (Attachment C).
ALTERNATIVES
1. Adopt the 2016 Recommended Budget. This is the recommended action.
2. Revise the 2016 Recommended Budget and adopt with Board-directed revisions.
3. Do not adopt the 2016 Recommended Budget. This is not recommended since the District
will not be in compliance with State regulations that require the District to adopt a budget by
December 31, 2015. If the District does not adopt a budget before December 31, 2015, State
statute (29-1-108 (3) C.R.S.) specifies the following penalty:
"Only ninety percent (90%) of the prior year's appropriation for operations and
maintenance purposes and objects is deemed reappropriated."

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute a contract with IQBG for ECM Owners
Representative Services. The initial contract period will extend through February 28, 2017, with two
additional one-year options, and the initial contract amount will be $653,230. Funding for the initial
contract period is included in the 2015 Amended Budget and the 2016 Recommended Budget.
BACKGROUND
In July 2014, RTD engaged Ciber to conduct an assessment of enterprise content management (ECM) at
RTD. This assessment, which was completed in November 2014, assessed the current state of ECM at
RTD, identified the top needs for ECM at RTD, and presented RTD with a path forward to meet those
needs. The Ciber assessment identified 65 different systems that were being used for content
management at RTD, which led to a lack of consistency in content management across the different
areas of the District. The top four needs identified by Ciber were:





Integrated ECM platforms
Organization wide uniform taxonomy (data classification and naming conventions)
Easy and robust search
Single source of “truth”

Ciber also recommended an information governance structure for RTD and proposed an implementation
plan to reach a coordinated ECM solution. RTD implemented the recommended governance structure by
the start of 2015. Through this structure, it was determined that RTD did not have the in-house
resources and technical expertise to implement an ECM solution. Therefore, staff decided to bring on an
owners representative to provide this specialized expertise in order to implement a successful ECM
program at RTD.
DISCUSSION
RTD issued a Request for Proposals for ECM Owners Representative Services on July 1, 2015. The RFP
was a best value procurement based on the following six evaluation criteria:







Understanding of technical, institutional, logistical, operational issues and solutions
Cost
Experience and commitment of project manager
Experience of the firms
Experience and commitment of key staff
Project plan

Packet Pg. 53

1.B.5

On August 4, 2015 RTD received proposals from three firms:




IQBG
Ciber
Triunity Engineering and Management

An evaluation committee consisting of representatives from different departments evaluated the
proposals, and determined that the IQBG proposal represented the best value to RTD. The IQBG team,
including the project manager and key staff, presented the strongest technical expertise in the areas of
content and records management. IQBG has extensive prior experience with similar projects in the
public sector, and staff received favorable references from previous clients. IQBG’s proposal also
showed the best understanding of the issues, and the most comprehensive project plan. Finally, the
IQBG proposal was the lowest cost of the three proposals received. IQBG also met the SBE goal of 8%
established by the Small Business Opportunity Office.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for the initial contract amount of $653,230 is included in the 2015 Amended Budget and the
2016 Recommended Budget. Funding for potential option years is programmed in the 2016-2021
Strategic Budget Plan as a part of the ECM implementation project.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit
Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute
a contract with IQBG for ECM Owners Representative Services. The initial contract period will
extend through February 28, 2017, with two additional one-year options, and the initial contract
amount will be $653,230. Funding for the initial contract period is included in the 2015
Amended Budget and the 2016 Recommended Budget.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Instead, use in-house staff to perform all necessary
work to implement an ECM solution. This is not recommended because RTD staff does not have
the specialized technical expertise to perform this work to the level needed to ensure successful
implementation of an ECM solution.
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not proceed with implementation of a District-wide
ECM solution.
Instead, continue with the current piecemeal implementation of content
management at the District. This is not recommended because the current implementations are
inefficient, and ultimately will cost the District more funds and staff time than a comprehensive
ECM solution.

Third Quarter 2015 Investment Report

CFO/AGM,

Finance

&

Board Meeting Date: November 10, 2015

INFORMATION
Please find the District’s investment report for the third quarter of 2015 attached.
The U.S. economy expansion continued (2.0 percent GDP growth) during the third quarter of 2015. The
unemployment rate declined over the period to 5.1% while general inflationary pressures remained tame.
In order to support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Federal
Reserve chose to continue with its accommodative monetary policy and leave the federal funds target
rate range (0.0% - 0.25%) unchanged during the second quarter. In determining how long to maintain
this target range, the committee will “assess progress—both realized and expected—toward its
objectives of maximum employment and 2% inflation”.
The District’s Investment Policy (the “Policy”) is conservative in nature and seeks to satisfy the three
primary objectives of: safety, liquidity and yield, in that order of importance.
The Policy specifies that:
“Quarterly reports shall outline the District’s total investment return and compare the portfolio’s
performance to a publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics
to the portfolio or sub-portfolio being measured. For the liquidity tier of the portfolio (cash and cash
equivalents), the specified index shall be the 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index as published by Bank of
America Merrill Lynch for the period being measured. For the enhanced cash portion of the portfolio
(securities maturing between 90 days and 5 years and with a target duration of 1 year), the designated
performance benchmark will be the Merrill Lynch 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.”
The total return on the liquidity and enhanced cash tiers of the District’s unrestricted portfolio and
investment benchmarks were as follows:
Liquidity Tier:

The yield of the District’s unrestricted portfolio through the third quarter of 2015 was 0.40% which
would produce annualized earnings of $864,296. The current return for the month of September was
0.54%.

Board Meeting Date: November 10, 2015

The Stored Value MyRide Card is a product that can be purchased by the general public to pay for
transit fares on fixed route buses and rail platforms. Stored Value is provided on reloadable plastic cards
encoded with chips. These cards can be loaded with certain dollar amounts and used much like a debit
card. Once the card is loaded, it can be used to board bus or rail until the dollar amount on the card is
less than the fare needed. Additional value can be loaded onto the card.
We are targeting January 1, 2016 for the Stored Value public pilot go-live which will include:
 Up to 5,000 customers will be selected to participate, participation will be staggered
 Stored Value available for purchase at RTD sales outlets
 Changes to the web portal that focus on Customer Care functionality
 Changes to the SMT System to accommodate the new fare structure
 Day Pass Printers installed and functioning on RTD fixed route buses
There are a considerable number of related efforts underway for the January 1 public pilot launch of
Stored Value and the new fare structure. The accomplishments since last reporting period include:


Day Pass Printers
o Pre-installation of wiring is underway.
o There are two active installation crews and a third will be added as necessary.
 Smart Card Off-site Infrastructure Hosting
o Hardware delivered, installed and being configured.
 Second Staff Stored Value SMT Pilot with RTD employees is underway.
o Over 211 RTD employees and Board Members are participating.
 Independent readiness assessment of stored value public pilot.
o Scheduled as a monthly activity.
 Developing an early signup campaign / program for stored value public pilot to start in December.
Until such time we have a sufficiently robust smart card distribution network in place, we will continue
selling ten ride ticket books, accepting one ride tickets, and continue issuing and accepting paper
transfers. Paper transfers will be printed on the Day Pass Printer to improve readability and compliance.
Additional phases of the SMT project will go live in 2016 including:

IT is working with The NewPush to offer
High Availability, Disaster Recovery
provisions, address Payment Card
Industry (PCI) data security compliance
and other cybersecurity issues.
Hardware has been delivered. The
reason for the yellow status is due to
the risk associated with too many
changes introduced to the SMT
environment at the same time. In
addition, Xerox needs to update the
Java based, web application
development program (JBoss) in order to
conform to security requirements. This
upgrade cannot take place until after Jan
1st.

Initial setups at NewPush
are underway. Credit cards
are not going to be
accepted for the public
pilot so migration to the
off-site facility is only
required prior to the go-live
of credit card purchases via
the web portal.

Day Pass printers have been ordered.
Installation cables have been delivered.
Bus Operations has manufactured the
Green brackets that will hold the printers. Pre(no

(3) December 2014 was high due to the year-end accrual of expenses which were paid in 2015
(4) Increase due to drawing funds from the TIFIA loan (TIFIA loan of $280m has been fully drawn) and issuance of 2015 COPs.
(5) Increase is due to funds being set aside for semi-annual debt service payments
(6) Variance is due to a timing difference between construction expenditures and bond and COP draws. Bond and COP draws will replenish this by year-end.
(7) Increase is due to the increase to fund balances per the 2015 amended budget
(8) Decrease will be replenished with draws on Bond and COP project funds at year-end
