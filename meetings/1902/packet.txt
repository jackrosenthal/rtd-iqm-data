BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: April 2, 2014

From:

Terry L. Howerter, Chief Financial Officer

GM

Date:

April 2, 2014

Board Meeting Date: April 8, 2014

Subject:

Adoption of 2015 Performance Measures

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
adopts the attached 2015 Performance Measures for Goals 1-7. There are 23 performance measures
in total.
POLICY REFERENCE
Fiscal Policy Statements – Budget Policy 10
BACKGROUND
Each year the RTD Board of Directors adopts a vision and mission statement, goals, objectives, and
specific performance measures. These measures provide a framework in which RTD can determine
how well it provides service to its passengers and the citizens of the District. A report detailing yearto-date performance on each of these measures is presented to the Board of Directors following the
end of each quarter.
DISCUSSION
Recommended changes in the adopted goals from 2014 to 2015 are listed below:


Goal 2.1 Prompt response to facility complaints
o The goal for Average Facilities Maintenance Complaints per Month is increased to <
20.0 from < 14.0 per month to reflect more accurate reporting on these measures and
system growth in facilities that is challenging our resources.



Goal 3.1 Maintain system-wide on time performance
o The goal for Local On-Time Service is changed from 88% to 86%. The goal for
Regional & Express On-Time Service is changed from 94% to 92%. These goals are
changed to reflect actual performance since 2011 while still setting a target for
improvement. These are more realistic goals when compared to our agency peer group.



Goal 4.1 Reduce average customer response time
o Average TIC Call Wait Time is revised to “Average TIC Speed of Answer”. The new
manager in TIC determined that the TIC call wait time was not being measured
accurately, and it is proposed that speed of answer is a more relevant and measurable
goal. Speed of answer measures the time from ring to answer and includes hold time.
The goal of < 75.0 seconds remains unchanged.
o Response Time on TIC Customer Inquiries was established at < 1.0 day and is found to
be no longer relevant. Response time on TIC customer inquiries is actually immediate in
that all TIC calls are answered as received. The measure is removed.



Goal 4.2 Improve level of customer complaints

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

o

Regarding Average Response Time to Customer Complaints, it is proposed that Initial
Response and Final Resolution be consolidated into one measure entitled “Average
Cycle Time”. This is the average number of days between when a customer contact is
entered for action and when the action is completed (closed). It is a measure of the
number of days required for RTD departments to research and resolve issues reported to
RTD by customers. The goal will remain at < 10 days and it is proposed that the
measure be reported by category as follows:
 RTD Transportation (Bus and Rail)
 RTD All Other Departments
 First Transit – Commerce City
 First Transit – Denver
 First Transit – Longmont
 Veolia



Goal 6.2 Increase ridership
o Overall Ridership Increase will be established by the financial plans inherent in the
adoption of the 2015 Annual Budget in November 2014 and in the Board-approved
Ridership Goal model and it is noted as a placeholder at this time. It is a forecast.



Goal 6.3 Increase in fare revenue and total operating revenue
o These measures will be established by the financial plans inherent in the adoption of the
2015 Annual Budget in November 2014 and are noted as placeholders until that point.
These are forecasts.
o EcoPass Revenue is eliminated from this measurement because it is considered no
longer relevant and the category has had zero to negative growth as large contract
users have been converting to other fare media such as FlexPass.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The 2015 Performance Measures will be utilized in the development of the final 2015 Adopted
Budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Adopt the 2015 Goals and Objectives and the accompanying performance measures included
in the 2015 Performance Report.
2. Modify the recommended 2015 Goals and Objectives and the accompanying performance
measures to be included in the 2015 Performance Report and make required adjustments, if
necessary, to the 2015 Requested Budget.
3. Do not adopt the 2015 Goals and Objectives and the accompanying performance measures
included in the 2015 Performance Report.

The measure was increased in 2013 to •6.0 due to the addition of the West Line which added 30% to the overall system
and 25 more grade-crossings coupled with limited history on the new line.

The goal was increased in 2014 to account for static higher level of complaints due to the stroller/wheelchair policy, fare
enforcement campaign, TIC availability, introduction of SmartCards, and the new West Line.

The measure is changed in 2015 from Initial Response and Final Resolution to Average Cycle Time, which will measure the
average number of days between when a customer contact is entered for action and when the action is completed (closed). The
categories are also added for 2015.

Review of 2015-2020 SBP Development
Process and 2015 Budget Assumptions

BACKGROUND
Staff has prepared the attached presentation to give the Board the opportunity to offer early,
substantive input in the development of the RTD 2015 Annual Budget. The purpose is to provide a
framework for conversation and to confirm Board approved parameters for decision making in the
development of the 2015 Budget and 2015-2020 Strategic Budget Plan (SBP).
DISCUSSION
The Strategic Budget Plan is RTD’s six year financial plan for the Base System. It is updated
annually and provides important cash flow planning information used to develop the upcoming new
capital budget and overall scope of program activity, including hours of service the District can afford
to provide. (See attached power point presentation.)
In the early stages of the development of the SBP and annual Budget, staff looks to the Board for
guidance regarding key budget objectives and assumptions that are to be used in the generation of
the financial plans. This is to inform the Board that staff intends to use these existing guidelines
unless overriding instructions are received. Parameters currently considered in the preparation of the
District’s 2015-2020 SBP and 2015 Budget are:
(1) fiscal management, including requirements to operate per specified performance goals and
to maintain a balanced budget
(2) continued development of Board-appropriated fund and capital replacement fund
(3) continued implementation of Fiscal Sustainability Task Force recommendations
(4) optimization of service levels for bus and light rail systems
(5) fuel lock for budget certainty
(6) State of Good Repair (SOGR) of facilities and equipment
(7) prioritization of capital and expense projects
(8) CBA negotiated costs through 2017
(9) planned fleet expansion/replacement and COP financing
Material uncontrollable variables which significantly impact RTD’s budgeting process and financial
planning can change, however. The following items will affect RTD in the development of the 20152020 SBP and 2015 Budget:
(1) sales and use tax revenues
a. current quarterly CU-Leeds School forecast (March 2014) for sales and use tax
indicates an increase in 2014 of 7.4% above 2013 collections
b. actual sales and use tax in January 2014 increased 8.1% over January 2013
c. forecast for 2015 is an increase of 6.3% over 2014
(2) fuel costs

Packet Pg. 16

1.C.1

a. final outcome of 2014 diesel fuel lock was $3.12/gallon
b. 2015 diesel futures estimate is $3.02/gallon at this time
c. current contract with diesel vendor expires at end of 2014 with two options
available to negotiate for extension
(3) inflation rate/CPI
a. Denver/Boulder area: CLC forecasts CPI of 2.5% in 2015-2020 (applied to
operating/maintenance/project costs)
b. National: CLC forecasts CPI of 2.1% in 2015-2020 (applied to fuel costs)
(4) fare increases
a. continual review with Board of periodic fare increases
b. per policy, the Board will consider a fare revenue increase of 10% every three
years; consideration scheduled for 2014 was deferred to 2015 and, therefore, we
are assuming a 10% fare increase in 2015
(5) additional grant revenues as they become available within Board policy
(6) economic conditions in Colorado and the District
(7) impact of State legislation and audit adjustments on sales and use tax revenue

Conclusion: Staff is seeking agreement to proceed with the guidelines and parameters identified to
develop a first draft of the SBP, which staff tentatively plans to present to the Financial
Administration & Audit Committee at the Budget Study Session on April 22, 2014.

(2) Increase is due to an additional $80 million draw on the FasTracks TIFIA loan
(3) Decrease is due to depreciation of assets
(4) The deficit is offset by allocations to unrestricted funds
(5) Increase is due to the FasTracks changes to the Rubber Tire allocation, two months operating costs reserve policy and the delay of the SW Rail relocation costs
(6) Increase is due to the full year budgeted increase to fund balances
