II. July 2010 Financial Status Report
Terry Howerter, CFO, shared that on page 14 of the document, the Sales Tax receipt variance
of ($2644) was due to an adjustment made back to the state. Without the vendor allowance
and the adjustments, the July 2010 would be up by 4.1% over July, 2009.
Director Brohl inquired on page 12 which indicated ridership down but fare revenues up. Terry
Howerter explained that the cash paying customers was up and those using the 10-ride
tickets up by $1M but the EcoPass was down. This reflected a movement from the big ticket
item such as EcoPass to the small item purchases.

Todd Nikkel added the unemployment in Metro area is 8.4%. We had a service adjustment of
1.2% from 2009.

Abel explained they had a high turnover during a 1 month period but otherwise did not have a
problem.
Director Daly and several other Directors asked questions related to the customer complaints.
Director Christopher inquired about the Title VI source of complaints—what % may be
legitimate? Bruce Abel replied there were three primary areas: fare enforcement campaign,
implementation of the stroller policy and the posting of Title VI signs. Director Martinez asked
if we excluded these three factors, how customer complaints would look. Bruce Abel will
follow up.
Director Christopher suggested we need to bring in the local contractor managers to have
ongoing dialog about these issues. Director Malpiede requested a tour of the Veolia site.
Director Tobiassen suggested that we could look at First Transit who should be commended
for exceeding their mileage between lost service maintenance road calls.
Other questions asked by Directors were responded to by Bruce Abel or a member of his
staff.
