Guiding Principles for Service
Design & Evaluation
• Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service
Standards.
• The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and
on transit dependent markets;
• The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
• Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family
of Services and the ability to enhance service when possible;
• Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are
provided without regard to race, color or national origin; also
disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
• Response to changes in the communities where services are
provided

Family of Services
• CBD Local service for Local or Limited routes operating
to/from the Denver Central business District
• Urban Local service for Local and Limited routes that
predominantly serve urban areas which have very high
residential and/or employment density.
• Suburban Local service for Local or Limited routes that
primarily serve suburban areas that have low to medium
density
• Express services that provide high-speed service from
suburban areas of the metro area
• Regional services that are essentially long-haul routes
providing service between outlying areas and employment
centers
• RTD also employs such service standards in evaluating
call-n-Ride service and SkyRide service
