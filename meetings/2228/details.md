### B. Recommended Actions

There were no recommended actions presented.

#### 1. Local Government Update - CRL Associates

Roger Sherman from CRL Associates congratulated Directors Archuleta and Francone on their installation to the RTD Board of Directors.  He also congratulated the newly elected Executive Committee.

Roger Sherman noted that December is a quiet month in the local governments.  He said that the Denver Metro Mayor Caucus will have their retreat on Saturday, January 10, in Boulder.  CRL Associates will attend the first half as the caucus does business behind closed doors during the second half.

Roger Sherman announced that his team is working on setting one on one meetings with the two new Adams County Commissioners and two new mayors: Clint Folsom, Superior, and Laura Christman, Cherry Hills Village. He added that the Metro Area County Commissioners meeting is on January 23.

Director Menten asked for more details on the Metro Area County Commissioners meeting.  Roger Sherman replied that it will be held on January 23.  He will communicate further details with the Board as they become available.

#### 2. State Legislative Update

Sherry Ellebracht, Government Relations Officer, presented the State Legislative Update on behalf of Brandeberry~McKenna, who were preparing for the beginning of the Legislature the next day, Wednesday, January 7.  She noted that the Brandeberry~McKenna team will have a more complete report during the February committee meeting.

Sherry Ellebracht pointed out that the Brandeberry~McKenna team will focus their efforts during the beginning of the session on setting meetings between the Directors and the Legislative leadership as well as new legislators.  She said that currently there are no bills of great importance for RTD.

Committee Chair Folska pointed out that some bills, like red light cameras and sources of funding, have unintended impacts on RTD operations.  She asked if there was a way for RTD to participate in education and support of bills that may have an unintended impact on RTD.  Committee Chair Folska acknowledged that identifying these types of bills could be tough.  Sherry Ellebracht replied that all bills that may have any impact on RTD are monitored closely.  If a bill may have a fiscal impact, RTD replies to the legislature and/or committees via email.  She added that staff could keep the Board updated on these types of communications.

Phil Washington, General Manager, pointed out that Shailen Bhatt will be installed in February as the new Executive Director for the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT).  Staff will invite Mr. Bhatt to meet the Board and to continue working closely with RTD.

Committee Chair Folska said that Jackie Millet, Chair of the Denver Regional Council of Governments, mentioned a tour done a few years ago with the RTD Directors and the CDOT Commissioners.  Jackie Millet suggested this as an event to welcome Mr. Bhatt.

##### a. State Legis. Board Update  1-6-15

#### 3. Federal Update - Squire Patton Boggs

Mike Dino, Senior Policy Analyst at Squire Patton Boggs, said that during the end of the 2014 session Congress passed all appropriation bills except for Homeland Security.  He noted that the New Starts was funded $2 billion more than last year, assuring that RTD’s FasTrack will get the recommended funding level of $150 million for fiscal year 2015 for the Eagle P3 Full Funding Grant Agreement.

Mike Dino shared that the Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) Discretionary Grant program took a hit of $1 million.  He pointed out that this would make successful TIGER grants harder as the pot continues to dwindle.  Transportation is still part of the TIGER grants.

Colorado’s new senator, Hon. Cory Gardner, was installed earlier that day.  He was assigned to the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee. Senator Bennett continues to serve on the Finance Committee.  Congressman Ken Buck hoped to be in the House Infrastructure and Transportation Committee but was appointed instead to the Judiciary Committee.

Mike Dino said that that new congress session started today.  The transportation funding debate will soon be addressed.  The Senate Commerce Committee leadership has noted that it is flexible and willing to look at all options.  Chairman Shuster of Congress’ Transportation and Infrastructure Committee said that they will not look at any further taxes, but instead look into repatriating corporation money and oil and gas explorations off shore.  The White House has said they will go along a bipartisan tax increase.  The White House favors a corporate tax reform to fund transportation.

Mike Dino added that RTD has submitted the fiscal year 2016 request for Eagle P3 of $167 million for the upcoming appropriation’s bill.  This breaks down to $150 million for 2016 and 17 million for shortfalls in 2012 and 2013.

RTD has made a grant request of $900,000 for the Workforce Initiative Now (WIN) program.

Director Bagley inquired regarding the Southeast corridor as it was not mentioned in the update.  Mike Dino replied that the project is not in the queue yet.  Squire Patton Boggs is working with the Federal Transportation Administration to formally propose this project.

### D. Other Matters

Phil Washington, General Manager, announced Terry Emmons as the new Assistant General Manager for Rail Operations.  He said that Terry Emmons has been with RTD for 27 years.  His first 13 years were in bus operations and the last 14 in rail operations.  In the last year Terry Emmons served as the liaison between Rail Operations and Capital Programs.  He is a graduate of RTD’s Leadership Academy and the first MAX program.

Committee Chair Folska congratulated Terry Emmons on his new position.

Committee Chair Folska adjourned the meeting at 7:39 p.m.
