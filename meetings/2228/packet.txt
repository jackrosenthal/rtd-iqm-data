Re:

Weekly Update

The 2015 Legislative Session will begin on January 7th. This session will start with several new
legislators and a change in balance of power in the Senate.
Brandeberry McKenna in preparation for the legislative session has met with the Senate and
House Transportation Chairs, Leadership and new members to continue to educate them on
issues of importance to RTD. Once the session begins we will reach out to Board Members to
schedule key meetings with leadership and new members to continue to build relationships
within the House and the Senate.
On the legislative front there is bi-partisan support from the House and Senate Transportation
Chairs for keeping whole the SB09-228 funding for transportation. Although the projections for
this revenue have decreased both Chairs have pledged to keep whole the portion that is pledged
for Transportation. Several issues will be revisited again this session: a P3 bill from Rep. Kraft
Tharp and Senator Matt Jones, Construction Defect Legislation by Senator Ulibarri and Rep.
Singer and seven bills related to workforce development. As soon as drafts of these bills become
available BBMK will share them with the Board.
We look forward to working with the Board and as always if you need anything from us please
contact Jenifer (303-638-4420) or Julie (303-898-8494).
