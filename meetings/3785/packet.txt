BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
2025 Fiscal Policy

April 8, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
April 29, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the modified 2025 Fiscal Policy.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Brenden Morgan, Acting Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Fiscal Policy establishes the financial control framework and governance of the Agency financial
resources for that year. Staff presents the proposed Fiscal Policy annually for the Board’s consideration
for the upcoming fiscal year. Once approved by the Board of Directors, it may be amended by the Board
at any time.
Proposed changes to the Fiscal Policy are recommended to the Board to address current and emerging
issues including those that result from regulatory, compliance, legislative, audit, Board-directed, fiscal
sustainability, best practices or other requisite sources.
The most recent modification to the Fiscal Policy was approved by the Board on October 22, 2024, for
the 2025 fiscal year. That Board-approved 2025 Fiscal Policy included provisions to address potential
financial impacts resulting from annual revenue growth limitations from the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights
(TABOR) to certain RTD revenues beginning in 2025. Under TABOR, approximately 50% of RTD’s
revenues would be subject to revenue growth limitations in which collections that exceed the sum of the
Denver-Aurora-Lakewood Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation rate plus the net change in District
property construction would be required to be returned to District taxpayers each year.
Proposed modifications to the 2025 Fiscal Policy were presented to the Finance and Planning Committee
as a discussion item during the March 12, 2025, meeting. No additional proposed modifications have
been made for this recommended action.
DISCUSSION
The purpose of this Recommended Action is to modify the 2025 Fiscal Policy to address the passage of
Ballot Measure 7A, which was approved by District voters on General Election Day, November 5, 2024.
Ballot Measure 7A asked voters to allow RTD to be exempt from TABOR revenue growth limitations in
perpetuity. This ballot measure was approved by voters with 69% in favor of passage.

Packet Pg. 28

15.A

As a result of the passage of Ballot Measure 7A, certain provisions in the 2025 Fiscal Policy that were
implemented to address TABOR revenue growth limitations may now be removed since they are no
longer applicable.
Attached is a modified 2025 Fiscal Policy with red-line corrections displaying the changes recommended
for approval as well as a clean final copy.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact from this 2025 Fiscal Policy modification.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
2021-26 Strategic Plan Official Version

April 14, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
April 29, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the attached document as the current official version of the 202126 Strategic Plan (Plan), which incorporates revisions to the Plan previously adopted by the Board in
June and October 2024.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Debra A. Johnson, General Manager and CEO
John McKay, Executive Business Partner
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD’s 2021-2026 Strategic Plan (Strategic Plan) was approved by the Board during a Special Board
Meeting held on Tuesday, August 10, 2021.
The five-year Strategic Plan includes the agency’s vision, “To be the trusted leader in mobility, delivering
excellence and value to our customers and community,” its mission, “Making lives better through
connections,” and values: passion, respect, diversity, trustworthiness, collaboration and ownership. The
Plan also establishes the agency’s four Strategic Priorities, which serve as the functional pillars used to
plan, develop, evaluate, and measure the agency’s overall performance:
•
•
•
•

Community Value: RTD strives to be a strong community partner, providing value to customers
as well as to the broader Denver metro region while sustaining planet Earth
Customer Excellence: RTD strives to consistently deliver high-quality customer service
Employee Ownership: RTD seeks to attract and retain a highly skilled and engaged workforce
Financial Success: RTD takes very seriously the management of all financial resources

Each Strategic Priority is associated with a measurable Success Outcome.
Leveraging data garnered through Community Value, Customer Excellence, and Employee Ownership
surveys, staff held strategy sessions to develop tactics to improve agency performance in specific areas.
These tactics were distilled into overarching Strategic Initiatives beginning in the 2023-24 employee
performance cycle, and a fourth Strategic Initiative was developed for the 2024-25 cycle:

Packet Pg. 42

15.B

Back to Basics: RTD strives to enhance the reach and impact of internal communications and to
redouble agency efforts to maintain assets in a state of good repair leveraging sound asset
management principles
People Power: Recognizing the critical importance of its people, the agency’s most important
resource, in achieving the agency’s mission, RTD seeks to vigorously address impediments to
recruitment and retention efforts and to foster a culture of learning and development
Welcoming Transit Environment: RTD seeks to reduce the impacts of criminal behaviors and
Code of Conduct violations on agency services and workplaces and, in doing so, to improve
community and employee perception of personal and public security on RTD property and
vehicles
Customer and Community Connections: RTD is committed to fostering community building and
enriching the customer experience
During the Board’s annual retreat in 2024, Board members discussed opportunities to enhance agency
transparency and bolster communication and engagement with jurisdictional partners, stakeholders, and
customers. At that time, Board members collectively discussed the development of a series of openended questions intended to probe whether the agency is meeting its performance goals:

Community Value

Customer Excellence

How is RTD achieving its How is RTD meeting
vision to be the trusted customers’ needs?
leader in mobility?
How has RTD delivered How is RTD creating a
value to the communities welcoming transit
it serves?
environment?

Employee Ownership

Financial Success

How well is RTD
How has RTD
attracting highly skilled demonstrated good
and engaged job seekers? stewardship of taxpayer
dollars?
What is RTD doing to
How has RTD developed
inspire employees to build trust as the leader in
a career?
mobility?

As noted on page 20 of the Strategic Plan document printed in 2021 and as contemplated by the Board
and staff that year, performance metrics are subject to change during the duration of the Plan. Adjusting
agency metrics, and thereby adjusting agency operations and performance, in order to achieve success
outcomes is an essential element of the Strategic Plan.
As such, draft revisions to the Agency Performance Scorecard, the essential core of the Strategic Plan
used to monitor progress toward the established Success Outcomes, were developed by staff in
collaboration with the Board Chair and Performance Committee Chair in 2024. Both the abovereferenced open-ended questions posed during the Board’s 2024 retreat, as well as a detailed discussion
with the Performance Committee during its meeting on Tuesday, May 21, 2024, directly informed those
draft revisions. The Board adopted revisions to the Agency Performance Scorecard during the monthly
Board meetings held on June 25 and October 22, 2024.

15.B

In regard to the Strategic Plan, the Office of the State Auditor (OSA), in an August 2024 report
regarding its recent fiscal governance audit of RTD, recommended that:
The Regional Transportation District (RTD) Board of Directors (Board) should ensure that it
receives sufficient information from RTD management so that it can monitor RTD’s
progress in meeting its strategic priorities by…[d]eveloping and implementing a written
policy, bylaw, or other form outlining what changes RTD management can make to RTD's
strategic plan, or other Board-approved or -adopted long-range plans, without Board
consultation and approval, and to what extent management must provide updates to the
Board on any changes made to these plans.
In its response to OSA, RTD stated:
The recommended action report that will accompany the next iteration of the 2021-2026
Strategic Plan in printed form will include reference to the elements that are within staff’s
authority to amend, such as work plans associated with strategic initiatives, and those
elements that must first be considered and approved by the Board prior to revision. Any
revisions to the Strategic Plan contained in this future iteration itself must first be
considered by the Board. Staff intends to present the updated 2021-2026 Strategic Plan
document for the Board’s consideration and approval by March 2025.
DISCUSSION
As pledged in RTD’s response to OSA recommendations in August 2024, a revised Strategic Plan
document has been developed for the Board’s consideration and is attached hereto. The document
features updated design and narrative elements, centered around the revised Agency Performance
Scorecard approved in October 2024.
In adopting this recommended action, the Board and staff acknowledge and affirm that any substantive
changes to the Strategic Plan’s Vision, Mission, Values, Strategic Priorities, and Success Outcomes
require a Board vote; those elements remain unchanged in the revised Strategic Plan document attached
hereto. The Board and staff also acknowledge and affirm that administrative and ministerial matters and
staff-level efforts to effectuate the Strategic Plan, such as Strategic Initiatives, tactics, projects, and
individual employee contributions, remain within the purview of staff to perform and adjust as needed as
directed by the GM/CEO or the GM/CEO’s delegates.
Copies of the reprinted 2021-2026 Strategic Plan will be provided to the Board Office and to all current
and newly hired employees in the interest of organizational alignment.
Staff anticipates collaborating with the Board in 2025 and into 2026 regarding an approach to develop
and, prior to the current plan’s expiration in August 2026, implement the next iteration of the agency's
Strategic Plan.

value to customers as well as to the broader Denver metro region while
sustaining planet Earth

“The Strategic Plan

Leveraging the strategic framework found in this updated Plan document, we have
collectively made great strides toward making RTD the public transit provider the
Denver region’s residents and visitors have come to expect. The agency’s progress
toward its long-term vision is a direct reflection of the commitment, dedication, and
hard work of this agency’s 3,000+ employees and its elected Board of Directors.

The Strategic Plan is RTD’s “north star,” and its four Strategic Priorities serve as the
functional pillars upon which decisions are made in addition to being used to plan,
develop, evaluate, and measure the agency’s overall performance:

While the Strategic Plan has successfully guided and informed the agency’s
strategic endeavors over nearly four years, the journey that began in 2021 is far
from over. RTD continues to evolve to meet the diverse mobility needs of customers
and communities across the region, much as it has over the agency’s 56-year
history. New challenges and opportunities arise, new partnerships are forged, new
technologies emerge, the region’s population centers and activity hubs shift and
expand, and all the while, RTD continues to rise to meet the occasion.

Thank you,

Debra A. Johnson
General Manager and CEO

As I look back on my tenure with the agency, I am proud of what we have achieved
collectively, and I am excited for the prospect of future successes. As I have said
many times, RTD is on the precipice of change, and I stand proud to serve alongside
the individuals who comprise this agency as we continue along this important
journey. Together, as “One RTD,” we will shape a brighter future for this region.

The following pages outline the Strategy Pyramid on which RTD’s
Strategic Plan is built. The agency’s vision, mission and values
outline what we aspire to achieve, what we do and what we stand
for. Successive levels in this structure note what we will focus on for
the life of the plan, as well as in the short- to medium-term to achieve
long-term goals. Intentional areas of emphasis in the
agency’s work explain how we will get there – and how each
employee will contribute.

The Strategic Plan is a living document and is subject to periodic
revision during its duration. The version before you is the second
iteration of the Plan first adopted by the Board of Directors in August
2021; it reflects updated agency performance metrics approved by the
Board in 2024 as well as strategic planning best practices garnered
since the Plan’s inception. The Plan’s Vision, Mission, Values, Strategic
Priorities, and Success Outcomes remain unchanged.

To make purposeful progress in any personal or professional
endeavor, you must have a plan. French author Antoine de SaintExupery declared it more than 80 years ago when he wrote: “A goal
without a plan is just a wish.” American educator Stephen Covey
was more direct in his approach to this idea, stating that to achieve
effective results, one must “begin with the end in mind.”

Duane, who operates Routes 3, 130
and 52 for RTD through contractor
Transdev, decorates the bus to
which he is assigned for every
major American holiday, including
Independence Day, Memorial Day,
Halloween, Easter, St. Patrick’s Day,
Valentine’s Day and New Year’s
Day. “My philosophy is, ‘My bus
is my office space, and I want to
be proud of what I am in,’” said
Duane, who joined Transdev close
to two years ago. “For my 10-hour
shift, I want to be happy, and all my
passengers want to be happy.”

“On behalf of the RTD team that
convened on Nov. 14 for the
Veterans Day Networking Breakfast
at Blake, I wanted to personally
thank Business Program Manager
Betsy and the Communications
and Engagement Department for
planning and hosting a wonderful
event to celebrate RTD’s military
veterans that served either in
an active-duty, reservist and/or
national guardsmen capacity. This
provided a momentous opportunity
to recognize and honor the military
veteran community, as well as the
opportunity for staff across the
agency to share stories about their
military careers and connect on a
more personal level.”

“I arrived at the airport after being
on a business trip for two weeks. I
was lugging a backpack and two
47.5-pound suitcases with two
weeks of clothing and all my tools.
I took the A Line to Peoria Station
and transferred to the R Line to
Lincoln Station. When I got on the
train, operator Gerald noticed the
many bags I was carrying with me
and asked where I was getting off.
He told me that he would make it
a point to stop at the platform at
Aurora Metro Center Station so I
could use the ramp. Getting the
heavy bags on and off using the
stairs is not easy. The operator was
happy, good-natured and did care.
I so much appreciated the extra
effort he put into it.”

Operator remains professional during
tense situation with customer

Bus operator’s commitment to safety,
friendliness sparks joy

“Route 105 operator James handled a
tense situation masterfully. When the
bus arrived at Southmoor Station, there
were quite a few buses ahead of us,
including another Route 105 bus, and
the driver had to pull around to Gate C.
Another customer was irate about that,
ignored the driver’s request that he move
away from the front door until we pulled
into the gate, yelled that he was going
to miss his train and then said, ‘This isn’t
even the right gate,’ followed by some
offensive language. I commend the driver
for remaining professional.”

“I wanted to pass along a driver’s
commendation. Mallard, the driver of the 8
a.m. eastbound Route 28, is an exceptional
driver and representative of RTD. This route
passes a senior center. He always welcomes
passengers aboard and ensures they are
seated safely before departing. As a regular
rider, I see this all the time. He also does this
without any delay in schedule. He knows the
regulars and is a genuine and nice guy.”

Impact Team’s assistance
appreciated during recent
maintenance work on A Line

Employees across the agency
displayed incredible teamwork
and dedication in delivering
Zero Fare for New Year’s Eve
service, benefiting thousands
of customers across the region
who relied upon RTD as they
celebrated. Thanks go to all rail
operators, supervisors and staff,
with many going above and
beyond to provide additional
trips into the morning hours. Also,
approximately 35 Transit Police
officers assisted customers on
New Year’s Eve, many riding trains
and buses. A few officers rode
bus Routes 15 and 0, as well as
the W Line, throughout the night.

“I was on the alignment checking
the crossings and the stations
when I ran into Information
Specialist Cali on our Impact
Team at Central Park Station.
The Impact Team was crucial in
helping customers coming from
our bus gates to the A Line and
instructing them how to board
the train to the airport. They also
assisted getting those traveling
to Denver Union Station back to
the correct bus gate. We were
lucky to have the Impact Team
on site helping, and there were
several relieved customers that
expressed appreciation for the
additional assistance.”

engineering. In addition, he is
instrumental in developing the
Capital Programs construction
group’s resource allocation model.
This model helps us assess our

We will approach our work in a collaborative manner, seeking and acknowledging

“I would like to highlight our Facilities
Maintenance (FM) group as they
tirelessly ensure that our employees
are kept safe during the hazardous
winter weather months. Without
their continued efforts to keep the
walkways clean and dry by coming
to work in the early hours, we would
likely have more to worry about
walking on icy, slippery surfaces. I
am particularly grateful for my FM
group here at Platte, and I would
like to highlight Bobby and his crew,
not only for his efforts outside my
building, but also inside the Platte
Wellness Center.”

“Shout out to Edward on the N
Line. He was so kind to my kids,
engaging them and making
them ‘official junior conductors.’
He taught them about trains
and how he operates them.
One of my kids had a terrifying
experience on a train last
year. Last week was the first
time riding the train since that
incident, and my daughter felt
very apprehensive. Edward didn’t
know any of this, but his way of
talking and having fun with her
helped her overcome her fear
and enjoy the ride.”

RTD Gives supports families in
need this holiday season

Zero Fare for Youth made a
permanent fare change

Eliminating transit-related traffic
fatalities and injuries

For its winter donation drive,
RTD chose to partner with A
Precious Child, a Broomfield
nonprofit that provides support
for families living within RTD’s
eight-county service area. The
organization’s empowerment
resource center provides a costfree store where families can shop
for clothing, food, home goods and
other essentials. At the conclusion of
the RTD Gives drive, RTD collected
enough winter clothing donations
from team members and customers
to fill a dozen 34-gallon-sized
contractor bags.

Zero Fare for Youth was launched in
September 2023 as a one-year pilot
program, enabling all youth 19 and
younger to use RTD services at no
cost. After it began, RTD received
positive feedback from many
schools about the program’s impact
in reducing truancy, and it garnered
support from school districts, youth
organizations, and customers
across the Denver metro region.
The Colorado legislature passed a
bill in May 2024 to appropriate up
to $5 million to RTD to continue a
zero-fare program for youth. With
approval by the Board of Directors
in July 2024, the program became
a permanent fare change.

RTD is bolstering efforts to
eliminate traffic fatalities and
injuries within its transit operations
and infrastructure by outlining
agency-specific initiatives related to
a Vision Zero strategy. Vision Zero
is an internationally recognized,
data-driven systems approach
to increase personal safety in
transportation spaces. The initiative
recognizes that traffic-related
deaths and serious injuries are
preventable and disproportionately
affect vulnerable populations,
including cyclists and pedestrians.
A resolution adopted by the
Board of Directors in October
2024 highlights RTD’s current and
ongoing efforts related to roadway
and customer safety.

Platte bus operator’s approach
to his work is the ‘gold
standard’

Hundreds of bus operators
admitted to 5280 Safe
Driving Program

“The Triennial Review is one of
the Federal Transit Administration
(FTA)’s management tools for
examining recipient performance
and adherence to current FTA
requirements and policies. The
triennial is not just a financial
review – it is a review of the entire
agency, touching nearly every
department throughout the district.
The FTA wants to ensure we are
protecting and maintaining their
investment. Dozens of colleagues
across the agency worked diligently
to gather requested documents
and provide information in a timely
manner. I commend them all.”

“Richard is the gold standard
of bus operators. Without fail,
he goes the extra mile. Greets
everyone cheerfully when they
get on the bus. Gives a person
a quick moment to get in their
seat, along with not hitting the
numerous bumps in the bus lane
hard, so people don’t fall or get
shaken. Calls out the major stops.
Repeatedly thanks people and
wishes riders a great day. You feel
like you matter, that the day will be
better from that ride.”

In May 2024, two-thirds of RTD’s
bus operators were admitted to
the 5280 Safe Driving Program,
meaning the recipient had driven
for at least one year without a
preventable accident. More than
200 operators had driven accidentfree for at least five consecutive
years. For the first time, mileage
was considered – honoring 77
operators who drove at least
100,000 safe miles. Platte operator
Destiny, who carries more than
six years of safe driving, said she
consciously takes time before
starting her day to center herself.
“You have to be cautious, you have
to read the road ahead, you have
to take care of your passengers,”
she said. “I go out there and do
the best I can. I go slow. There’s no
need to be in a hurry.”

Internal Communications
team refines its strategy to
communicate with employees

In 2024, Maintenance of Way
(MOW) employees replaced rail
along the Southeast Corridor to
restore normal service speeds for
customers. Due to the scope of
rail replacement and maintenance
needed, this project might ordinarily
be outsourced to a third-party
contractor. “They’ve really risen
to the occasion,” Dennis, RTD
Light Rail Maintenance of Way
Manager, said of the team’s efforts.
“They’ve been able to leverage
their knowledge, skills, and abilities.
What’s impressed me is how they’re
able to problem solve and come
to a collective agreement on how
to mitigate hazards and do the
work safely.”

RTD completed the first phase of its
downtown rail reconstruction work
three weeks ahead of schedule.
The multi-phased rail project, which
began in early June 2024, will
resume in 2025. The first phase of
the Downtown Rail Reconstruction
Project focused on reconstructing
light rail track and infrastructure
at five key intersections in the
Downtown Loop.

Taking into account research and
observations shared in listening
sessions in 2023, the Internal
and Executive Communications
team in 2024 refined its strategy
and introduced new tactics to
ensure RTD’s workforce of more
than 3,000 employees remained
engaged and informed. The team
collaborated more closely than
ever with individuals, groups, and
divisions across RTD to share
information of agencywide interest.
In addition, an Employee Ownership
Task Force group began meeting
in March that focused its efforts on
improving employee satisfaction
with the communication of agency
news, projects, and initiatives. The
group’s recommendations were
presented to the Leadership Team
in December.

Hundreds of managers and
supervisors complete training

In July 2024, RTD-PD gained a
team member unlike any they had
seen before – a full-time college
student named Johan Sherpa, a
senior at University of Colorado
Denver studying criminal justice.
Sherpa joined the Transit Police
Department through its new
police cadet program, providing
insights about day-to-day work and
providing credit for most colleges
and universities. RTD Acting
Co-Chief Steve Martingano created
the program for students to learn
about the agency and explore the
public safety field. “The program
dedicates time and resources
to make sure someone knows
what they’re coming into when
considering being an officer,” he
said. “Police work is more of a
calling and a passion.”

In June 2024, more than 480 RTD
managers and supervisors from
throughout the agency completed six
modules of training developed by the
agency’s reimagined Development
and Training Division. The team
worked for nearly a year to make it
possible. Employees were intentionally
placed into mixed cohorts so that
their classmates were not necessarily
the people they see every day.
Recognizing that participants came to
training with differing roles, lengths
of tenure and experiences at RTD,
the training ensured that managers
and supervisors received uniform
information around expectations for
these positions, including how to take
ownership, support team members,
and lead a team. Groups took part in
ample discussion about how agency
values could be incorporated into
daily work. “I think that was the most
important thing: getting back to
basics and level setting training,” said
Development and Training Manager
Dr. Melissa McDowell.

A substantial safety and security
project completed in 2024 is in use
on all RTD buses: the addition of
live look-in equipment in case of an
emergency situation. The live lookin software supersedes a system
on agency buses for decades.
Using the prior technology, dispatch
could only hear audio inside the
bus. With the addition of the live
look-in system, RTD’s public safety
dispatchers can use a secure,
cellular network connection to
hear audio and view video in real
time from the cameras on board
that vehicle. The agency’s light rail
vehicles will be retrofitted with this
ability by June 2027, in accordance
with state requirements. Commuter
rail vehicles, maintained by
concessionaire Denver Transit
Partners, already have this
capability on the company’s own
private wireless network.

Starting in May 2024, RTD’s Transit
Police Department made a change
long desired by staff: It added an
overnight team of RTD-PD officers
to respond to calls across the
agency’s system. Assistance with
call response in early morning
hours previously was provided
by Allied Security, police officers
on secondary contracts with RTD
or other police agencies as they
were able. “By having RTD-PD staff
respond,” noted Co-Acting Chief
Glyn Horn, “we will always be that
priority for both our employees
and customers.”

“Transit Police Officers Dominick
Castiglione, Brian Beary, and Erik
Giles demonstrated exceptional
dedication and professionalism in
handling a bomb threat involving
a bus near Sheridan Boulevard
and West 82nd Avenue in Arvada.
The vehicle was inspected by
Westminster Police Department
and the Denver County Sheriff K-9
unit, and no suspicious items were
located. Despite the tense situation,
the officers ensured the safety of
passengers and the bus operator
during the process.”

almost-12-year RTD bus operator
often provides his customers with
more than a wide smile and a warm
greeting – he has helped many
people plan a trip, understand the
agency’s fare structure, and figure
out efficient connections. And he
does this in English and Spanish.
It is these qualities that led Rubio
to be named a 2024 Mobility

and Mobility for All Program –
specifically, Favorite Regional Bus
Driver. Treating his customers with
respect and dignity is important to
Rubio, who is focused on delivering
a friendly, safe and timely ride.

Public transportation plays a
critical role in the health of the
communities it serves. RTD’s
dedicated team of transit
professionals encounter customers
who may be experiencing a
personal crisis on any given day.
As the conversation around mental
health awareness and personal
safety continues, RTD is doing its
part to provide help by creating and
sharing a Safety and Mental Health
Resources card. These flyers are
printed in English and Spanish and
include contact details for Customer
Care and the Transit Police
Department, helpful community
groups and 24-hour crisis support.
Updated cards were first placed
on light rail trains and fixed-route
buses in August 2024, and by early
2025, they were added to RTD’s
commuter rail lines. Transit Police
colleagues also carry copies of
these cards to provide customers.

A complimentary, high-frequency bus service provides another convenient transportation
option between Union Station and Civic Center Station.
The service operates with limited stops during morning and evening rush hours along 18th and
19th streets. Free MetroRide is part of RTD FasTracks’ 2004 voter-approved plan to expand
transit across the downtown Denver area.

Flatiron Flyer

SkyRide

The Flatiron Flyer service features 18 miles of express and high-frequency bus service
between downtown Denver and Boulder, serving Westminster, Broomfield, Superior,
and Louisville. Express lane extensions, queue jumps at highway ramps, enhanced
shelters, ticket vending machines, and electronic monitors with bus arrival information all
contribute to enhanced travel time, reliability, and customer experience.

Express service to Denver International Airport (DEN) via two separate routes serve Boulder
and Greenwood Village, respectively, and several stops in between. The 104L, 145X, and 169L
bus routes also serve the airport.

FlexRide

Commuter Rail

FlexRide is on-demand micro transit, delivering first- and last-mile service within select
RTD service areas. It is an ideal service for customers traveling to appointments, to run
errands, or to connect with other RTD services in specific neighborhoods. Customers
may book reservations online or by phone. FlexRide fares mirror regular RTD fares with
discounts available to seniors, LiVE participants, youth, individuals with disabilities, and
Medicare recipients.

Three commuter lines are operated by Denver Transit Operators (DTO), a privately held
company that is contracted by RTD to operate and maintain this system within the
Denver metro area. The N Line is directly operated by RTD. The four commuter rail lines,
i.e. A, B, G, and N, carry more passengers, operate at higher speeds, and make fewer
stops than light rail. The A, B, G, and N lines provide fast, convenient service from
Denver Union Station.

46

Access-a-Ride is the agency’s branded ADA complementary paratransit service. It provides
curb-to-curb localized transportation in the metro area for customers with disabilities. Customers
can select from either a subscription service or a reservation service, with the ability to schedule
rides up to seven days in advance. Fare is limited to twice the applicable charge for a similar trip
on a fixed route. Also available for eligible Access-a-Ride customers is Access-on-Demand.
RTD works closely with the ADA Paratransit Advisory Committee, a representative panel from
the disabled community, health care and social services officials, service providers and state/
local representatives, on all aspects of the service.

Light Rail
Using electric-powered trains, light rail transit runs on the street, in highway medians, or
underground. With a mix of widely spaced stops to cover long distances, and more frequent
stops in the downtown area, light rail consists of the D, E, H, L, R, and W lines.

Fiscal Year 2025 Budget Summary
Revenue
RTD derives revenue primarily from sales and use taxes collected within RTD’s boundaries. These taxes comprise
67% of RTD’s funding sources and are subject to economic volatility necessitating maintenance of three months of
operating reserves in accordance with RTD’s Fiscal Policy RTD is also a recipient of federal funding which comprises
26% of revenues and is apportioned to RTD based on information provided to the FTA’s National Transit Database
(NTD). Customer fares only contribute 4% of revenue and are collected according to fare modifications implemented
in 2024 which lowered and simplified RTD’s fare structure. The remaining 3% of revenue is collected from investment
income and other miscellaneous sources such as advertising revenues.

Operating
Expenses

$1,233,611,000

RTD’s largest annual expenditures support the core mission to provide transit services to customers. Appropriations
for these operating expenses are developed from the System Optimization Plan (SOP) to deliver efficient transit
services including the necessary expenses for support services. The largest portion of these expenses is for people
power in which RTD employs over 3,000 dedicated employees. RTD also contracts over 50% of transit services to
private employers.

Debt
Service

$229,427,000

Debt Service
RTD has incurred debt obligations that were primarily entered for the voter-approved FasTracks transit system
expansion as well as lease-purchase agreements to finance the purchase of equipment such as buses and trains.
These obligations consume a significant portion of revenue sources each year and management constantly monitors
these obligations for opportunities to reduce the debt service burden through refinancings and has limited financial
risk by only issuing fixed rate debt with call provisions.

Financial Forecasts
Annual budgets are developed from longer-term financial forecasts which seek to balance projected revenues with
projected expenditures to ensure long-term fiscal sustainability. Each year, RTD develops a Five-year Financial
Forecast (FYFF) which establishes the financial constraints to which annual appropriations must adhere. In addition,
RTD periodically provides a 30-year financial forecast to the Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) for
coordination with state and local agencies to develop a regional Transportation Improvement Plan (TIP).

in 2026, focusing on future service modifications and community needs.
The process to complete an updated COA will typically take 18 months
and the final plan will incorporate feedback and input from customers,
stakeholders, and the public.
The COA will analyze boardings, customer demand, operator staffing
levels, land use population growth, transit-oriented and housing
developments, employment centers, and travel patterns. The final COA
will serve as RTD’s roadmap, ensuring the agency remains efficient and
responsive to community needs.

In July 2022, the RTD Board of Directors adopted the System
Optimization Plan (SOP), the agency’s branded name for its COA. The
SOP is a detailed evaluation of travel patterns, demographics, and transit

RTD’s fixed-route services to better meet near-term mobility needs in the
region. RTD’s planned route reinstatements and modifications can be

The FFTP takes a “Facilities First” approach, which focuses on preparing the facility
infrastructure and the workforce before new vehicles are delivered. The plan details the strategy
and actions that RTD should take in the near-term (2025–2035) to meet RTD’s 2050 net zero
emission goal.

Work conducted as part of the FFTP included:

The near-term strategy outlined in the plan provides RTD with the flexibility to take immediate
cost-effective emission-reduction strategies, while also providing the agency the opportunity to
take advantage of future improvements to pricing, availability, and technological capabilities.

• A fixed-route fleet analysis, which assessed various propulsion systems and their ability to meet RTD’s
existing and future provision of services
• A facility analysis, which assessed RTD’s facilities and the upgrades needed to support a new fleet
technology, as well as evaluated how a potential new facility could help support new fleet technologies
• A workforce analysis, which assessed the skills needed to maintain newer technologies, and to
ensure RTD’s workforce will be prepared for a transition
• A financial analysis, which utilized RTD’s mid- and long-term financial plans to evaluate costs and
identify potential funding sources for a transition

The near-term strategy outlines a plan for the purchase of 451 new diesel hybrid buses and 75
battery electric buses by 2035. The purchase of these vehicles will be dependent on necessary
upgrades being completed at RTD’s bus facilities prior to the procurement of those vehicles.
The total incremental capital cost of implementing the near-term strategy outlined in the FFTP
is $591 million, a figure that includes the facility upgrade costs and the cost to purchase diesel
hybrid and battery electric buses, which are significantly more expensive than diesel buses.
Federal and state funding sources are available to help pay for some of these costs; however,
the amount of available grant funding is significantly less than RTD’s needs.

this holistic approach was necessary, as transitioning a large fleet of buses to alternative technologies will
have significant implications on the infrastructure needed to support such an endeavor.

preventative maintenance projects, new capital projects, customer communications, and state
and local transportation legislation.
The CAC has 17 seats comprised of residents and businesspersons from around the district,
each appointed by the RTD Board of Directors. Members serve for a maximum of two,
three-year terms, with approximately one-third of the committee’s 17 seats up for appointment
each year. Members receive a transit pass to access RTD’s services in recognition of their
time commitment.
RTD promoted CAC membership through extensive outreach, including emails to 150+
organizations, a news release to major media outlets, and distribution to 670 contacts,
including TMOs, public information officers, and media subscribers.

Subregional Service Councils
In 2022, the agency established Subregional Service Councils (SSCs) to more directly engage with local stakeholders on matters
related to service planning and local transportation issues. Based on travel sheds for RTD services, the councils split the agency’s
district into five separate subareas: Southwest, Southeast, Northwest, Northeast, and Boulder County.
The councils provide a forum for dialogue about the agency’s services and any related concerns or opportunities. Meetings typically
occur quarterly, and membership includes local jurisdiction staff, transportation management organizations, transit advocates, and
non-profits that represent RTD’s customers. The agency specifically included transit advocates and non-profit organizations to have
a more diverse representation on the SSCs. This ensures that under-represented customer groups have a voice in the planning of
RTD’s services.

Customer Feedback Panels

RTD Impact Team

RTD Listens

The Impact Team, introduced in 2024, consists of RTD employees who are routinely deployed to RTD stations and facilities. These
ambassadors provide assistance in real time, answer questions, demonstrate how to use our services, and offer specific information
that helps customers achieve a greater comfort level with our services.

An essential component of RTD’s Strategic Plan involves critical ongoing feedback from those we have the privilege to serve.
The agency establishes and maintains mutually beneficial relationships with community partners, customers, and stakeholders,
as well as outreach programs, across our service area. These continual engagement efforts help us to collaboratively identify
service delivery challenges and opportunities, brainstorm solutions, and provide assistance where and when customers need
it most. Following is brief snapshot of several formalized outreach and engagement programs.

Represented Workforce
More than two-thirds of RTD’s workforce are represented by either the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1001 (ATU 1001) or the
Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) Lodge 72. Both unions advocate for their members by negotiating collective bargaining agreements.
The unions also work closely with RTD’s leadership to ensure their workers have an optimal work environment that supports their
safety and well-being.

DIRECTOR REQUESTED AGENDA ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Resolution Supporting Pilot Program for Records Request Fee
Waivers Serving a Public Purpose

April 24, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
April 29, 2025

Added to Committee Agenda as a Director initiated request pursuant to RTD Board Bylaws Art. V,
Section 3(b). Requires formal motion and second at Committee meeting.
MOTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt the attached resolution creating a pilot program to provide CORA and
CCJRA request fee waivers for a set number of requests serving a public purpose
BOARD REPRESENTATIVE
Chris Nicholson, Board Secretary, District A
Matt Larsen, Director, District E
Brett Paglieri, Director, District M
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD is committed to transparency and to making its records available to the public for inspection as
provided by the Colorado Open Records Act (CORA) and Criminal Justice Records Act (CCJRA). The
agency receives hundreds of requests for its records each year. These requests are submitted through
RTD’s online records request portal: https://www.rtd-denver.com/open-records. Requests come from a
variety of requestors, including customers, academics, other governmental entities, RTD employees and
Directors, claimants or their counsel, and members of the media. The agency has one employee in the
Information Governance and Management Division within the General Counsel Department who serves
as the agency’s records custodian and coordinates the collection and review of records in response to
requests. Sections 24-72-205(6) and 24-72-306(1), C.R.S. allow governmental entities to charge a fee
for the research and retrieval of records. Under CORA, effective July 1, 2024, the maximum hourly fee
is $41.37 with the first hour being free of charge. Currently, RTD charges $30 per hour. Requestors,
after making their initial request, are provided fee estimate for the amount of time over an hour needed
to produce the requested records and can decide whether to pay the fee or narrow the request. The
timeframe the agency has to produce the records is tolled until the requestor submits the fee.
CORA requests and CCJRA requests for records of official action must be fulfilled within three business
days; however, should requests require additional time for staff to compile, the agency will notify the
requestor of the extenuating circumstance and will have an extension of up to seven business days.

Packet Pg. 77

15.D

Under CORA, public entities may waive fees for records used for a public purpose, including public
agency program support, nonprofit activities, journalism, and academic research. Under CCJRA, fees
may be waived in the criminal justice agency’s discretion. Because staff time is needed to research and
respond to records requests that could otherwise be devoted to the agency’s primary mission, RTD does
not grant fee waivers.
Research to date has shown that there are at least a few public entities which have policy
accommodating requests serving a public purpose. The State of South Dakota waives fees for the first
$100 of photocopies for members of the media. The City of Boulder has an exemption whereby students
requesting documents related to a school assignment need not pay fees related to their CORA request
unless their request involves extensive staff time. Finally, some governmental entities have specifically
stated that certain custodians of records (e.g., city manager, town clerk) have the discretionary capacity
under the respective statute to waive or reduce fees when the request is made for a public purpose.
The practice of charging a fee on all requests, which require more than one hour of staff time (the first
hour is always free under the law), is done to encourage efficient use of government resources, and to
discourage actions which place an unnecessary burden on government resources. It is a widely accepted
practice across governmental entities to charge fees to retrieve government records, and to charge those
fees indiscriminate of the identity of the requestor.
To further expand access to RTD’s public records Director Nicholson, and subsequently Directors Larsen
and Paglieri, offered the attached resolution which would create a pilot program for CORA and CCJRA
request fee waivers.
This resolution represents an evolution of an ongoing policy debate by the Board to expand access to
public records. The concept of providing request fee waivers was first discussed at the Executive
Committee meeting on February 20, 2025 at the behest of Director Nicholson. That resolution was
subsequently revised and brought back to the Executive Committee as a three-director initiated
Recommended Action March 20, 2025. At that meeting, the Executive Committee amended the
resolution before recommending the item to the full Board for approval. The full Board decided to return
this matter to the Executive Committee for further evaluation and a motion was made to recommit the
previously considered resolution to the Executive Committee at its April 24, 2025 meeting. Previous
resolutions have primarily focused on providing fee waivers to members of the media; however, this
resolution would expand those eligible for a fee waiver to requestors with a public purpose.
Subsequently, Director Nicholson has worked with staff to further refine the concept, and because of
the extent of the changes to the scope of the resolution, this is being reintroduced as a new item with
Directors Larsen and Paglieri in support.
DISCUSSION
The proposed resolution provides for the following:

Packet Pg. 78

15.D

Starting July 1, 2025, RTD will implement a pilot program such that up to 170 records requests
each year serving a public purpose will be eligible for a fee waiver for the first additional hour of
staff time beyond the initial free hour of staff time provided for all requests
Requestors will be able to review the definition of what constitutes a public purpose when
making their request and then attest whether their request meets the definition of a public
purpose
The definition of a public purpose is defined by C.R.S. § 24-72-205(4) and includes, but is not
limited to public agency program support, nonprofit activities, journalism, and academic research
The pilot will be subject to sunset review in November 2026
Accounting for all requests placed in 2023, 2024 and through March of 2025 over 95% records
requests are fulfilled with 1 – 2 hours of staff time needed.
The Committee is asked to discuss the merits of the attached resolution and take action on whether to
support the resolution or not.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
If the pilot program is implemented and there are 170 requests for an additional free hour of staff time
made each year under the terms of the pilot program, the financial impact would be no more than
$10,200 in foregone fees at current fee rates.

BOARD CHAIR REQUESTED AGENDA ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Bylaw Amendments Regarding Director Accountability

April 24, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
April 29, 2025

Added to Committee Agenda by the Chair pursuant to RTD Board Bylaws Article VI., Section 1(b).
Requires formal motion and second at Committee meeting.
MOTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt the proposed Bylaw Amendments, which detail the grounds,
process, and accountability measures the Board may take to hold Directors accountable.
REPRESENTATIVES
Julien Bouquet, Board Chair
Jack Kroll, Executive Manager, Board Office
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Board has adopted Bylaws, Operating Guidelines, and an agency-wide Code of Ethics that detail
how Directors should engage with one another, the public, staff, and their work as members of the
Board. Further, Directors are subject to local, state, and federal laws in their capacity as elected officials.
Article VII, Section 10 of the Board’s Bylaws defines the process for the removal of one of the Board’s
five officers (Chair, First Vice Chair, Second Vice Chair, Treasurer, and Secretary). However, there
currently exists no route, outside of the censure process defined by Robert’s Rules of Order, for the
Board to act to hold Directors in another capacity accountable for violations of any of the
aforementioned Board-adopted expectations or local, state, or federal laws.
Many governmental bodies organizations have adopted rules and procedures for holding their elected
membership accountable. Legislatures at the state and federal level have the power to impeach and
remove their members as well as members of other branches of government. City councils have adopted
processes either through censure or violation of an established code of ethics to hold members
accountable. The Regents of the University of Colorado, which also functions as an elected board of
directors, has established a policy through which a regent may be disciplined.
While most local governing bodies do not explicitly detail disciplinary procedures or available
accountability measures, research by the Board Office indicates that disciplinary actions taken by local

Packet Pg. 84

15.E

bodies can include: fines, removal from committee leadership roles, removal from committees, and
censure.
The attached proposed amendments to the Board Bylaws were presented to the Executive Committee
for review in March 2025, and the Board leadership as well as the Board Office solicited input from all
Directors subsequently via email. Following the incorporation of feedback received, the proposed
amendments are now being brought forward for the Board’s consideration as a Recommended Action.
DISCUSSION
The Committee is asked to review and discuss the attached proposed amendments to the Bylaws. These
amendments, if approved, would establish a new article in the Bylaws governing the grounds, process,
and potential accountability measures the Board, via the Chair, may take to hold Directors accountable
for conduct that runs afoul of the Board’s Operating Guidelines, RTD’s Code of Ethics, or local, state, or
federal law.
To be adopted, proposed amendments to the Bylaws must receive an affirmative vote of 10 or more
Board members.
This discussion aligns with the strategic priorities of Community Value as the Board’s ability to ensure
adherence of its members to expectations ensure a better functioning governing body for the community
RTD serves.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no fiscal impact arising from the Board amending its Bylaws.

PREAMBLE
The Regional Transportation District (“RTD” or the “District”) was created by the Regional Transportation District
Act, § 32-9-101 et seq., C.R.S. (the “RTD Act”) (Senate Bill 309, Sessions Law of Colorado, 47th General Assembly,
First Regular Session, 1969). The District is a political subdivision of the State of Colorado, with those powers
specifically granted and those reasonably implied from the RTD Act and necessary or proper to carry out the
objects and purposes of the District.
The authority of the Board of Directors to adopt these Bylaws is expressly conferred by the RTD Act, at § 329-114 (1) (b), C.R.S. Some rules governing the internal affairs of the Board of Directors are contained in the RTD
Act, while others are contained in other laws and others, by delegation, are to be established by the Board. For
convenience of reference, those that are contained in the RTD Act or other laws, together with those that are
adopted under delegated authority, are combined in these Bylaws. Nothing contained in these Bylaws, nor any
omission from them, shall be construed as an alteration or deviation from any grant of power, duty, or responsibility
to, or any limitation or restriction imposed upon the Board under the RTD Act or other applicable laws as they
now exist or may be amended.
ARTICLE I – DEFINITIONS
The terms “district,” “board,” “director,” “publication,” “mass transportation system,” and other terms defined in
the RTD Act, and used in these Bylaws, shall have the same meaning as in the RTD Act unless the context clearly
indicates a different meaning. “State Audit” as used in these Bylaws means the performance audit conducted by
the Office of the State Auditor in 2009 and 2010 and reported to the state Legislative Audit Committee in March
2010.
ARTICLE II – BOARD OF DIRECTORS
All powers, privileges, and duties vested in or imposed upon the District shall be exercised and performed by and
through the Board, whether set forth specifically or implied in these Bylaws. The Board may delegate to officers
and employees of the District any or all executive, administrative, and ministerial powers.
ARTICLE III – OFFICE

as in its judgment are needed to conduct the business of the District. The office of the Board shall be located
within the RTD District.

authorized to temporarily appoint a Director to a standing committee with such appointment

special, and committee meetings by virtual meeting platform, speakerphone, or other similar
electronic means by which all participants can hear and speak with each other. The Board
Committee Chair and Vice Chair may jointly agree to cancel or postpone a scheduled Board, special,
or committee meeting. Matters not expressly assigned in these Bylaws to a specific standing
committee should be assigned to the most appropriate standing committee.
c. Executive Committee. The Executive Committee will consist of the five Board officers, which are
the Chair, First Vice Chair (Chair Pro Tem), Second Vice Chair, Secretary, and Treasurer. The
responsibilities of the Executive Committee include: establishing the agenda for each regular
meeting of the Board; addressing public affairs of the Board; managing external relationships on
behalf of the Board; reviewing and recommending positions on relevant legislation; overseeing the
internal governance of the Board; reviewing the Board Office budget; reviewing the performance
of the Board Office Executive Manager; planning Board retreats; and other ministerial matters
affecting the Board.

Performance Committee.
The Performance Committee has three oversight functions: 1) Performance management of the
General Manager and CEO, 2) in close coordination with the General Manager and CEO, the
development, ongoing review, and subsequent amendment of long-range strategic planning efforts,
including the agency’s Strategic Plan, 3) high-level monitoring of agency performance in relation to
the Strategic Plan.
With respect to the performance management of the GM/CEO, the committee has primary oversight
over the GM/CEO’s employment agreement, annual goalsetting, the annual performance
assessment framework, and annual performance assessment. The Performance Committee is also
the appropriate venue through which the Board members periodically engage in dialogue with the
GM/CEO to discuss feedback regarding the GM/CEO’s ongoing performance.
The Committee is responsible for monitoring performance metrics related to, and progress
toward, the agency’s Strategic Plan. The Committee will collaborate with the GM/CEO to set the
cadence, timing, and topics of performance updates relative to the Strategic Plan when
developing and adopting its annual committee work plan.

Section 2.

INDEPENDENT AUDIT COMMITTEE

Consistent with the International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing published by
the Institute of Internal Auditors (Standards), the Board will appoint a separate, independent Audit
Committee that will establish and oversee the internal audit function consistent with the Standards.
Section 3.

OTHER COMMITTEES

PREAMBLE
The Regional Transportation District (“RTD” or the “District”) was created by the Regional Transportation District
Act, § 32-9-101 et seq., C.R.S. (the “RTD Act”) (Senate Bill 309, Sessions Law of Colorado, 47th General Assembly,
First Regular Session, 1969). The District is a political subdivision of the State of Colorado, with those powers
specifically granted and those reasonably implied from the RTD Act and necessary or proper to carry out the
objects and purposes of the District.
The authority of the Board of Directors to adopt these Bylaws is expressly conferred by the RTD Act, at § 329-114 (1) (b), C.R.S. Some rules governing the internal affairs of the Board of Directors are contained in the RTD
Act, while others are contained in other laws and others, by delegation, are to be established by the Board. For
convenience of reference, those that are contained in the RTD Act or other laws, together with those that are
adopted under delegated authority, are combined in these Bylaws. Nothing contained in these Bylaws, nor any
omission from them, shall be construed as an alteration or deviation from any grant of power, duty, or responsibility
to, or any limitation or restriction imposed upon the Board under the RTD Act or other applicable laws as they
now exist or may be amended.
ARTICLE I – DEFINITIONS
The terms “district,” “board,” “director,” “publication,” “mass transportation system,” and other terms defined in
the RTD Act, and used in these Bylaws, shall have the same meaning as in the RTD Act unless the context clearly
indicates a different meaning. “State Audit” as used in these Bylaws means the performance audit conducted by
the Office of the State Auditor in 2009 and 2010 and reported to the state Legislative Audit Committee in March
2010.
ARTICLE II – BOARD OF DIRECTORS
All powers, privileges, and duties vested in or imposed upon the District shall be exercised and performed by and
through the Board, whether set forth specifically or implied in these Bylaws. The Board may delegate to officers
and employees of the District any or all executive, administrative, and ministerial powers.
ARTICLE III – OFFICE

as in its judgment are needed to conduct the business of the District. The office of the Board shall be located
within the RTD District.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Senate Bill 25-161 Board Position

April 29, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
April 29, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to review its position on Senate Bill 25-161 (SB161).
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Davies, Government Relations Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD developed its Board-adopted 2024 Legislative Program to serve as a guiding document for staff to
pursue goals related to legislative and policy matters. A Legislative Program serves as a living document
that can be adjusted throughout a legislative session to provide an avenue for Board-adopted policy
positions to be communicated and pursued by agency staff.
SB161 was introduced on Tuesday, February 11, 2025, and assigned to the Senate Transportation and
Energy Committee. The full text of the bill, as amended, is appended as Attachment A. During the
monthly Board meeting on February 25, 2025, the Board of Directors voted to take an amend position
on SB161 that sought to make four amendments to the bill. A summary of the requested amendments
and the changes offered by the bill sponsors that were adopted into SB161 are listed herein:
•

Board Request: Amend the bill to make the two current nonvoting RTD Board Directors on the
Accountability Committee voting members
o Status – Bill sponsors approved an amendment that adds one current RTD Board Director
as a voting member who is appointed by the Governor

•

Board Request: Amend the bill to add two voting members appointed by the RTD Board of
Directors who are former members of the RTD Board of Directors to the Accountability
Committee
o Status – Bill sponsors approved an amendment that adds one former member of the RTD
Board of Directors as a voting member who is appointed by the Governor

•

Board Request: Amend the bill to remove the ex officio members to be added to the Board of
Directors
o Status – Bill sponsors approved an amendment to accomplish the requested amendment

Packet Pg. 131

16.F
•

Board Request: Amend the bill to remove all references to eliminate write-in candidates from the
bill
o Status – Bill sponsors are not willing to offer an amendment to accomplish this request

DISCUSSION
Provided below for Board’s awareness is a section-by-section summary of SB161 as amended.
•

Section 1 – Legislative declaration

•

Section 2 – Adds language stating the Board of Directors has the authority to enter into service
partnership agreements.

•

Section 3 – Directs RTD to align with goals set in the state’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Target,
establish employee retention goals, and develop performance measures to evaluate progress
related thereto; and to follow federal regulations related to assaults on transit workers

•

Section 4 – Requires RTD to:
o
o
o
o
o
o
o

o

Develop a 10-year strategic plan (plan) by September 30, 2026, to be updated every four
years
Conduct a comprehensive operational analysis (COA) at least every five years beginning in
2026
Routinely report to the Board regarding the plan and COA
Study or contract with a third party to study and identify opportunities to increase funding
to achieve the goals, measures, and targets identified in the plan
Create, maintain, and publish a series of public information dashboards
Update policies related to service standards, equitable transit-oriented development, and
service buy-up policy
Notify the Denver Regional Council of Goverments and the Department of Local Affairs of
any known infrastructure gaps that exists within specific areas of a transit-oriented
community within the agency’s service area
Implement EcoPass program updates, promote the program, and streamline bulk purchases

•

Section 5 – Requires the transportation commission to develop and publish best practices and
technical assistance materials concerning the creation of regional transportation authorities to
increase funding for transit and to provide additional transit services within the state

•

Sections 6 – Adds language to the powers, duties, functions, rights, and privileges of the Board

Packet Pg. 132

16.F

Directors, one voting member from the Board of Directors, and one voting member who was a
former member of the Board of Directors to evaluate and make recommendations with regards to
RTD governance, compensation, representation of local jurisdictions and state agencies, and
employee retention. Requires a report on findings and recommendations be submitted to the
General Assembly and Governor by January 30, 2026
•

Section 9 - Makes changes to the reporting requirements that RTD must adhere to with regards
to receiving Clean Transit Enterprise grant funding and exempting RTD from those requirements
for state fiscal year 2026

•

Section 10 – Appropriation of $146,720 for use by the Colorado Energy Office to conduct the
accountability committee

Given that the legislative session is coming to a close, there will be limited opportunity for the Board to
adjust its position on SB161. The Board is asked to consider whether it wishes to adjust its current
position of amend.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
As introduced, SB161 requires RTD to produce a 10-year strategic plan, a comprehensive operational
analysis beyond the scope of current staff planning, update service standards, and create new public
information dashboards beyond current requirements in state law. Staff has not determined which, if
any, of these tasks can be completed utilizing existing staff resources and funding authorization. Funding
sources to complete these requirements have not been identified and will need to be addressed on a
case-by-case scenario; the 2025 Budget and external grant opportunities are potential funding sources
for one or more of these requirements.
