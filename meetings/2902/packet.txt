VERBATIM RESPONSES

I sense a simmering sense of unrest regarding service levels (bus) in my district and in nearby districts. Some leaders are
concerned that RTD may be tempted to concentrate service efforts in the core city to drive higher ridership numbers. Make no
mistake RTD is being monitored carefully so we need to remember that the Reimagine effort needs to be all-inclusive and
district-wide.
If I could have picked 2 more, they would have been Visionary Thinking and Customer Focus
"I only selected three above, because I suggest four more here. (Sorry, it's hard to pick 5, even hard to pick 7. I add more than
5 because I think it's important to broaden the discussion.) I believe that RTD's future financial stability depends a lot on its
local relationships. I think this needs to be reflected in the guiding principles for Reimagining RTD (supporting strategic priority
#1 above). Here are two examples of principles above that I would re-focus. VISIONARY THINKING. Being forward thinking as
a partner with CDOT, DRCOG, the MMC and the 36 MCC and all our local jurisdictions. HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT. Design service
that helps achieve state and local government partner goals for air quality and environmental sustainability. I also believe that
Jarrett Walker's paradigm that ridership depends on frequency is thought provoking and a good piece of a bigger puzzle. I
don't think frequency is the only way to increase ridership. RTD's data show that EcoPasses and other passes increase ridership
and revenue. I would rewrite this principle: RIDERSHIP GROWTH. Design service and a pass/fare system that will move the
most people. SERVICE BALANCE. Finally, I don't think that ridership growth and service balance throughout the district are
clearly distinct. We have a big district and everyone pays the same tax. We have to find a way to provide a return even while
developing ridership."
RTD supports other businesses by delivering employees and customers AND reducing the number of vehicles that would
otherwise be on the road so goods and service workers can more quickly get through town or to their destinations in town.
Jurisdictions’ planning departments will play a big role in improving service over the next decade by allowing or requiring
density that can be easily served by transit.
"These are strong. While I understand that this is preliminary, I am caution to chose items that may conflict. For example,
selecting social equity and service balance. The word “need” provided some clarity. I am curious as to how these may interface.
I am also curious if system sustainability could be merged with service balance, I may need to better understand the distinction.
Thanks for putting this together. "
Technology/Innovation as a goal subsumes the goal of Visionary Thinking. If we are technologically creative and innovative we
will be, and will be recognized as, visionary thinkers. While Service Balance and Social Equity are important goals, if we do not
increase ridership and, as a result, become both fiscally responsible and sustainable, we will not be able to provide equity.
"Principle: empower local communities as regards their transit service, perhaps by giving preference to communities where
planning, zoning and credible economic/community development efforts underway will (short term and mid term) support
transit use, even if current densities are not sufficient.
Principle: Leverage local/community/private investment or willingness to financially support transit.
But: We need to agree on one or more measures of service provision (service miles? funding?) as a way to gauge geographic
equity -- and allow us to set goals that place us on the continuum that Jarret Walker talked about. Maybe establish some
minimums so as to appropriately counter or balance the advantage that some areas have in terms of wealth or tax base, but
still (in significant part) emphasize ridership development. This is a key area of focus I'd see for our study. We're paying the
consultants the big bucks; let's have them devise a means of our arriving at and mediating this."
"1. Actively maintain positive relationships with stakeholders and taxpayers so that these parties desire to continue being
partners with RTD in improving transit. Improve efforts towards a more productive partnership with member jurisdictions.
2.FasTracks must either be completed or a way found to make whole - transit-wise and financially- the unfinished corridors.
3. If coverage is sacrificed for ridership, uncovered areas or constituents should be compensated in an equitable manner"
"Public accountability Possible extension to customer focus. Continued public outreach and engagement, included in that is
the availability of easily accessible records/data Extension to technology/innovation / customer focus.
Having privacy as a principle is necessary when selecting/implementing particular technologies. It's a matter of prioritizing to
make sure respecting and protecting privacy is sequenced properly when making a decision about a new technology."
"Fiscal responsibility to stretch existing funding. No tax increases."
Interconnectivity - seamless integration with all forms of mobility
