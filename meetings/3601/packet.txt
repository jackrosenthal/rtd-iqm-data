BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Sixth Amendment to GM/CEO Employment Agreement

January 17, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
January 30, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt a Sixth Amendment to the Employment Agreement with General
Manager and CEO Debra A. Johnson to increase her base salary by 1.8% from $395,120 to $402,325
effective November 9, 2023, consistent with the Board-adopted GM/CEO Compensation Philosophy and
Compensation Base Salary Range.
REPRESENTATIVE
Director Erik Davidson, Board Chair
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
On September 29, 2020, the Board and Ms. Johnson entered into an employment agreement
(Agreement), and subsequently the parties executed five amendments thereto.
Consistent with a recommendation from the Office of the State Auditor in a March 2010 Performance
Audit, the Board adopted a GM/CEO Compensation Philosophy on September 26, 2023, as a framework
to guide and anchor the Board’s compensation decisions related to the GM/CEO’s compensation. Under
the Compensation Philosophy, the GM/CEO’s compensation is designed “[d]emonstrate internal equity,
fairness, and transparency while being externally market competitive, aligned to the 50th percentile of
comparable public transit agencies, and related public and private sectors where executive talent may
reside.”
Per the Third Amendment to the Agreement, the Board engaged a third party by competitive solicitation
to conduct a compensation and benchmarking analysis (Compensation Analysis). Because the
Compensation Analysis data used to establish the recommended base salary range was nearly 12
months old, to remain competitive with the market, an aging factor was utilized to account for market
changes. On October 24, 2023, the Board adopted Compensation Base Salary Range of:
•

Minimum: $292,600 Midpoint: $402,325 Maximum: $512,050

The Employment Cost Index (ECI) measures changes in the cost of employees to employers over time. In
the private sector, business owners and human resources professionals can use the ECI to make
decisions about pay adjustments to help them stay competitive. In the public sector, the Federal Reserve

and others use the ECI to gauge the health of the labor market, adjust contracts, and research the labor
market. (Source: US Bureau of Labor Statistics)
DISCUSSION
Consistent with the Board-adopted GM/CEO Compensation Philosophy and Compensation Base Salary
Range, it is recommended that the Board adopt a sixth amendment to the Agreement to align Ms.
Johnson’s base salary with the midpoint of the salary range. The midpoint represents full market pay for
an employee whose knowledge, skills, and abilities allow them to fully perform the job duties.
Ms. Johnson’s education and more than 30 years of transit sector experience and more than 20 years of
senior C-suite leadership experience support placing her at the midpoint. Such placement aligns with the
Board’s commitment to being market competitive. In adopting this recommended action, the agency
seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan priorities of Employee Ownership.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Alignment of the GM/CEO’s base salary with the Board-adopted GM/CEO Compensation Philosophy and
Compensation Base Salary Range pursuant to this recommended action would result in a 1.8% increase
of Ms. Johnson’s base salary from $395,120 to $402,325 effective November 9, 2023.

Compensation Philosophy for the GM/CEO

RTD’s mission to make lives better through connections and vision to be the trusted transit leader in
mobility, delivering excellence, and value to our customers and community requires the expertise of a
highly skilled and seasoned executive capable of leading and inspiring an innovative, complex, and
unique multi‐modal transit agency.
An overarching goal of the Board of Directors is to attract, motivate and retain the requisite executive
talent necessary to achieve the agency’s mission and vision. The Board further acknowledges that
competition to attract a GM/CEO with the required suite of competencies, knowledge, and experience
is extremely challenging given the highly specialized transit environment. Therefore, RTD must be market
competitive on a Northern American scale in both public and private sectors when considering talent
acquisition and retention.
Furthermore, the following principles will guide the components of the GM/CEO’s total compensation.
Total compensation will be designed to:





Demonstrate internal equity, fairness, and transparency while being externally market
competitive, aligned to the 50th percentile of comparable public transit agencies, and related
public and private sectors where executive talent may reside
Comprise a component of pay‐for‐performance designed to motivate and incent performance
and retention
Incent agency, team, and individual performance aligned to the agency’s strategic objectives and
directly linked to a pay‐for‐performance framework
Provide appropriate opportunities for personal and professional development
Recognize the value in compensation components that directly support the health and welfare
of the GM/CEO today (e.g., health [including dedicated executive health benefits], dental, vision,
PTO, executive leave) and into the future (e.g., deferred compensation, retiree health benefits)
Consider specific agency variables (e.g., size, values, strategic goals, stage of evolution,
geographical markets)
Recognize and respect the agency’s fiscal reality and the commitment to responsible stewardship
of public tax dollars and customer revenue
Adapt nimbly to changing external (e.g., labor market) and internal circumstances (e.g., fiscal
restraints)
Be reviewed for market competitiveness and legislative/regulatory compliance (local, state, and
federal) on an annual basis

Additionally, the GM/CEO’s performance will be formally assessed on an annual basis.
Further, should the GM/CEO be employed with a term contract, the Board will endeavor to hold
meaningful discussion about extending the term of such contract no later than 18 months prior to the
expiration of the contract’s term.
Adopted by the RTD Board on September 26, 2023
