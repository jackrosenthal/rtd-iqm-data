Subject:

North Metro Rail Line Intergovernmental
Agreement (IGA) with the City and County of
Denver

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager to enter into an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) between the City and
County of Denver (CCD) and the Regional Transportation District. The agreement includes specific
terms defining CCD’s local agency contribution, coordination, and the rights and responsibilities of each
party associated with construction of the North Metro Rail Line within the City’s boundaries.
BACKGROUND
This IGA, like RTD’s previous commuter rail IGAs with CCD, sets forth CCD’s local match obligations
and establishes specific design and construction requirements within the City’s boundaries. This IGA
also incorporates provisions in RTD’s existing CCD/RTD Light Rail Master Agreement dated March
25, 1993 where appropriate for commuter rail.
DISCUSSION
This IGA between CCD and RTD establish the local agency contribution amount for CCD and how that
local agency contribution will be met. The IGA sets forth the commitments from RTD and CCD regarding
financial obligations, responsibilities, coordination, and cooperation between both agencies with respect
to the North Metro Rail Line.
Local Agency Contribution
The IGA stipulates that CCD’s local agency contribution will be $5M or 22% of the total local
agency contribution amount of $22.725M (2.5% of the total project cost of $909M as defined by
the 2010 Annual Program Evaluation).
The Parties acknowledge that credits held by Denver for its local agency contributions to other
FasTracks corridor projects covered by previous intergovernmental agreements between RTD and Denver
exceed the cumulative Denver share of the Local Agency Contribution for all FasTracks corridors,
resulting in an “Overmatch” which exceeds Denver’s Contribution under this Agreement. The Parties
agree that an amount of Denver’s Overmatch from other FasTracks corridors shall be applied in an
amount equal to Denver’s Contribution for the North Metro Project in full satisfaction of Denver’s
obligation to make a Local Agency Contribution for the North Metro Rail Line. If the reconciliation of
other FasTracks corridors should definitely show that this Overmatch does not exist or is insufficient to
cover Denver’s Contribution for the Project, then the Parties will take such action as necessary to amend
this Agreement or enter another IGA to assure that Denver’s Local Agency Contribution is satisfied.
The following items are also included in this IGA:


Certain terms of the CCD-RTD Light Rail Master Agreement are incorporated with no changes,
while other terms are amended as appropriate for commuter rail and this project.

Denver will be afforded opportunities to comment on any supplemental environmental studies
completed for the North Metro Rail Line within Denver’s boundaries.
Right-of-way processes are identified and clarified, including survey and monumentation and
approval of changes to final right-of-way plans.
National Western Stock Show (NWSS) station design, parking and timing are describ ed.
Land transactions required for project construction, including purchases, no-cost transfers,
exchanges and easements between CCD and RTD, are identified.
RTD cooperates with construction of fiber optic to support regional emergency
communications, providing easements and labor while CCD and others pay for materials.
RTD agrees to pay $6/sf for purchase and $2.50/sf for easements of park property, and to
fund traffic and planning studies near the NWSS station.
The parties agree to a process for determining and funding improvements related to project
construction.
RTD to provide funding toward future improvements on Brighton Boulevard as RTD’s
contribution to this work.

Summary
IGAs are required with CCD, as with other jurisdictions along the North Metro corridor, in order to define
the respective rights and responsibilities of each party, and to define the local agency share credit. The
recommendation is to authorize the General Manager to sign this agreement defining those rights and
responsibilities of RTD and CCD with respect to the North Metro Rail Line project. The signed IGA
defines coordination between RTD and CCD for the North Metro project and demonstrates that right-ofway and other coordination responsibilities have been defined.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The financial elements of the IGA are funded in the project budget for the North Metro Rail Line
project.
ALTERNATIVES
1.
Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee
that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to enter into an Intergovernmental
Agreement (IGA) between the City and County of Denver (CCD) and the Regional Transportation
District. The agreement includes specific terms defining CCD’s local agency contribution, coordination,
and the rights and responsibilities of each party associated with construction of the North Metro Rail
Line within the City’s boundaries.
2.
Do not accept the recommendation of the FasTracks Monitoring Committee. This would cause
the North Metro Rail Line project to delay or stop due to lack of right-of-way, and may increase costs
due to schedule delay. In addition an IGA is required to provide for FasTracks-required local match
determination, property acquisitions from CCD needed for the project, and responsibilities and
coordination. This action is not recommended.

HOV3.
• Tolling policy designed to maintain travel reliability in all lanes. RTD’s BRT
benefits from this reliability.
• Tolling policy for US 36 was developed by HPTE with input from corridor
stakeholders.
• Toll rates cannot go below Express bus fares during peak periods per
RTD/CDOT/HPTE intergovernmental agreement.
• RTD does not control tolling on US 36 or any other facility in Colorado.
