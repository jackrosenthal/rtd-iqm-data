BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: September 5, 2013

From:

Terry Howerter, Chief Financial Officer

GM

Date:

September 5, 2013

Board Meeting Date: September 10, 2013

Subject:

Authorization of RTD Investment Policy

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
adopt the Investment Policy Statement (the “Policy”), attached.
BACKGROUND:
The Policy specifies the practices and procedures that pertain to the investment of RTD’s operating and
reserve funds. The Board last approved modifications to the Policy in September 2012. Section 10 of
the Policy states “The CFO shall conduct a review of the Policy on an annual basis and present the
policy, denoting any changes, to the Board of Directors for approval.”
DISCUSSION:
The Policy, among other things, outlines the investment objectives, standards of care, eligible
investment securities, credit and maturity parameters and diversification parameters. It is conservative in
nature and identifies its principal objectives as: safety, liquidity and yield, in priority order. The Policy
specifies reporting requirements and requires a system of internal controls designed to protect RTD
against loss of funds due to fraud, employee error or imprudent actions by employees.
Staff is not recommending any changes to the policy at this point in time but will continue to look for
ways to refine and improve the policy.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
The Policy presents no negative financial impacts to RTD.
ALTERNATIVES:
1. The Board may authorize the Investment Policy Statement (the “Policy”), attached. This is the
recommended alternative.
2. The Board may further revise the Policy.

Regional Transportation District
Investment Policy Statement

The purpose of this document is to specify the policies and procedures that support a prudent and
systematic program for investment transactions involving operating and reserve funds of the
Regional Transportation District ("RTD").
2. SCOPE
This investment policy ("Policy") applies to investment of all operating and reserve funds of the
RTD (collectively, the “Portfolio").
This Policy shall not restrict the ability of RTD to invest proceeds from the issuance of RTD
securities in financial obligations permitted through board-approved bond resolutions or
indentures of trust pursuant to which the securities were issued. The standards of care dictated
for investments of other RTD funds shall also pertain to the investment of such proceeds.
3. OBJECTIVES
The objectives, in priority order, of the RTD's investment activities shall be:
3.1 Safety
Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the investment program. Investments of RTD
will be made in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the Portfolio. To
attain this objective, RTD will endeavor to mitigate credit and interest rate risks.
Credit Risk: RTD will minimize credit risk, which is the risk of loss due to the failure of the
security issuer or backer, by:
•
•

Limiting investments to the types of securities listed in the Authorized Investments
section of this Policy.
Diversifying the Portfolio in accordance with Policy limits in order to minimize the
potential for losses from any one type of security or any one individual issuer.

Interest Rate Risk: RTD will minimize interest rate risk, which is the risk that the market
value of securities in the Portfolio will fall due to changes in market interest rates, by:
•

Maintaining Portfolio duration appropriate to the cash flow requirements of RTD,
thereby reducing the likelihood that securities would need to be sold on the open
market prior to maturity.

Packet Pg. 7

Attachment: Investment Policy 083013 (1688 : Authorization of RTD Investment Policy)

1. PURPOSE

1.B.1.a

3.2 Liquidity
The Portfolio will remain sufficiently liquid to enable RTD to meet all cash flow requirements
which might be reasonably anticipated. This will be achieved through maturity diversification
and purchases of securities that have an established secondary market.

The Portfolio shall be designed with the objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout
budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account the investment risk constraints, liquidity
needs, and cash flow characteristics of the Portfolio.
4. STANDARDS OF CARE
4.1 Prudence
All RTD officers and employees involved in the investment of RTD funds, along with any
external investment advisors, shall adhere to the guidance provided by the “prudent investor”
standard to insure that:
“When investing, reinvesting, purchasing, acquiring, exchanging, selling, or managing
public funds, a trustee shall act with care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the
circumstances then prevailing, including, but not limited to, the general economic
conditions and the anticipated needs of the agency, that a prudent person acting in a like
capacity and familiar with those matters would use in the conduct of funds of a like
character and with like aims, to safeguard the principal and maintain the liquidity needs
of the agency. Within the limitations of this section and considering individual
investments as part of an overall strategy, investments may be acquired as authorized by
law."
RTD shall recognize that no investment is totally riskless and that the investment activities of
RTD are a matter of public record. Accordingly, it recognizes that occasional measured losses
are inevitable in a diversified portfolio and shall be considered within the context of the overall
Portfolio’s return, provided that adequate diversification has been implemented, and that the sale
of a security is in the best long-term interest of RTD.
Authorized investment personnel acting in accordance with this Policy and exercising due
diligence shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security’s credit risk or
market price changes, provided that deviations from expectation are reported in a timely fashion
and appropriate action is taken to control adverse developments.

1.B.1.a

4.2 Delegation of Authority

RTD may, in its discretion, contract with one or more investment advisers, registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, to manage a
portion of its Portfolio assets. Any such advisor shall comply with this Policy and such other
written instructions as provided by RTD.
While it is understood that the procedures and trading counterparties of a contracted investment
adviser may differ from those of RTD, contracted investment advisers must maintain internal
controls and compliance systems at least as extensive as those of the RTD in order to assure
adequate protection of RTD assets in keeping with the standards of prudence outlined below.
4.3 Investment Procedures
The CFO shall establish written procedures for the operation of the investment program,
consistent with this Policy, which shall include explicit delegation of authority to persons
responsible for investment transactions. No person may engage in an investment transaction
except as provided under the terms of this Policy and the internal procedures established by the
CFO. Persons who are authorized to transact investment business and wire funds on behalf of
RTD are listed in Appendix 1 to this policy.
4.4 Internal Controls
The CFO shall establish a system of internal controls, which shall be reviewed annually. The
controls shall be designed to prevent loss of funds due to fraud, employee error,
misrepresentation by third parties, or imprudent actions by employees of RTD.
4.5 Ethics and Conflicts of Interest
Investment activities shall be performed in accordance with RTD’s Code of Ethics and other
policies of RTD. Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from
personal business activity that could conflict with the proper execution of the investment
program, or which could impair their ability to make impartial investment decisions. Employees
and investment officials shall disclose to the General Manager any material financial interests in
financial institutions that conduct business with RTD, and they shall further disclose any large
personal/financial/investment positions that could be related to the performance of the Portfolio.
Employees and officers shall subordinate their personal investment transactions to those of RTD
particularly with regard to the timing of purchases or sales.

Attachment: Investment Policy 083013 (1688 : Authorization of RTD Investment Policy)

RTD is granted legislative authority to invest its funds pursuant to Colorado Revised Statutes,
Section 32-9-119. Management responsibility for the investment program is hereby delegated to
the General Manager and his designees. The General Manager’s designee will hereinafter be
referred to as the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”).

1.B.1.a

5. AUTHORIZED INVESTMENTS

Credit criteria listed in this section refer to the credit rating at the time the security is purchased.
Rating categories defined by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations (“NRSRO”)
include intermediate rating categories. For example, the second highest rating category will
include bonds rated AA+, AA and AA- for Standard & Poor's and Fitch and Aa1, Aa2 and Aa3
for Moody's Investors Service. In the event that an issuer or security is downgraded below the
minimum rating level for any specific security that is held in the Portfolio, the CFO will review
the exposure of that security holding and will determine if it is advisable to sell such holding.
Maturity restrictions shall be calculated from settlement date to maturity date. Portfolio
percentage restrictions by security type and issuer are applicable only on the date of purchase of
the investment.
The Portfolio will be limited to an aggregate exposure of 50% for the following investment
types: Municipal Bonds, Corporate Bonds, Commercial Paper, Time Deposits/Time Certificates
of Deposit and Banker's Acceptances.
1. U.S. Treasury Obligations. Obligations in the form of bills, notes, bonds or certificates
of indebtedness backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America.
100% of the Portfolio may be invested in U.S. Treasury Obligations. The maximum
maturity for investments in U.S. Treasury Obligations shall be limited to five years.
2. U.S. Agency Obligations. Obligations issued by or fully guaranteed as to principal and
interest by those Federal Agencies or United States government-sponsored enterprises
described in 24-75-601.1(1)(b) (an ‘Agency” or “Agencies”). Eligible Agencies shall be
rated no lower than the highest category by any NRSRO. No more than 75% of the
Portfolio may be invested in Agency obligations with no more than 25% being invested
in a single U.S. Agency. Subordinate debt of any U.S. Agency is not authorized. The
maximum maturity for investments in Agencies shall be limited to five years.
In the event that one or more NRSRO rates such Agency obligations below the highest
rating category but no lower than one of the two highest rating categories, RTD's funds
may continue to be invested in Agencies if the maturity from the date of settlement to
maturity does not exceed three years. The diversification limit set forth in the prior
paragraph (no more than 75% of the Portfolio may be invested in Agency Obligations
with no more than 25% being invested in any one Agency) shall apply.
3. Municipal Bonds. Obligations of a political subdivision of any state, including bonds
payable solely out of revenues from a revenue producing property owned, controlled or
operated by the state or any local agency or by a department, board, agency or authority

Authorized investments for RTD funds are specifically listed below. RTD recognizes that
investment risk can result from issuer defaults, market price changes or various technical

1.B.1.a

6.2 Competitive Bidding
A record shall be maintained of all bids and offers for securities transactions to support RTD’s
competitive pricing process. Relative offerings shall not be required in the purchase of
obligations at their initial auction or offering. Typically, awards will be made to the bidder
offering the highest effective yield consistent with the Policy: however, transaction costs,

Packet Pg. 13

Attachment: Investment Policy 083013 (1688 : Authorization of RTD Investment Policy)

RTD does not make investments for the purpose of trading or speculation, but, rather, with the
prevalent intent to hold securities to maturity. The prohibition of speculative investment
precludes pursuit of profit through unusual risk or conjectural fluctuations in market prices.
However, fluctuations in market rates or changes in credit quality may produce situations where
securities may be sold at a nominal loss in order to mitigate further erosion of principal or to
reinvest proceeds of sale in securities that will out-perform the original investment.

1.B.1.a

7. SAFEKEEPING AND CUSTODY

With the exception of collateral under repurchase agreements (discussed below), all investment
securities purchased shall be held in a safekeeping account or trust custody account at a
designated third party custodian. For safekeeping accounts, the institution shall issue a
safekeeping receipt for each security, listing the specific instrument, par value, rate, CUSIP and
any other pertinent information. In addition, the safekeeping or trust custody institutions shall
provide a statement on at least a monthly basis listing all securities held in account, including
book value and market value of holdings at month end.
For collateral (purchased securities) under repurchase agreements, RTD may utilize tri-party
repurchase agreements with an acceptable third-party custodian provided that RTD is satisfied
that it has perfected interest in the securities used as collateral, and that RTD has a properly
executed tri-party agreement.
7.2 Delivery vs. Payment
All investment transactions will be executed on a delivery versus payment basis
8. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
Investment reports shall be prepared on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis. Transaction
summaries shall be maintained and available in the office of the CFO or other authorized
investment personnel. Quarterly investment reports shall be submitted to the Board of Directors
and shall outline RTD’s total investment return and compare the Portfolio’s performance to a
publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics.
Within 120 days of the end of RTD’s fiscal year, a comprehensive report on RTD’s investment
program and investment activity shall be prepared for the Board of Directors. The annual report
shall include quarterly comparisons of investment return and may suggest improvements that
might be made in the investment program. Such annual report shall include any other item of
significance which may enhance the understanding of the investment program. Each investment
advisor shall submit like reports in a timely manner based on the respective terms of each
contract and agreement
All securities holdings reports for RTD shall disclose the maximum maturity liability to RTD
(the stated maturity) as well as the first call date of each callable security held.

9. PERFORMANCE STANDARDS

The current board-approved index for the liquidity tier of the Portfolio (cash and cash
equivalents) is the 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index as published by Bank of America Merrill
Lynch. For the enhanced cash portion of the Portfolio (securities maturing between 90 days and
5 years and with a target duration of 1 year), the designated performance benchmark is the
Merrill Lynch 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.
RTD recognizes that bond proceeds must be invested in accordance with Section 1.148 of the
U.S. Internal Revenue Code, related to arbitrage rebate, which limits the investment returns
which may be achieved or retained by RTD on such proceeds investments. For purposes of this
Policy “bond proceeds” shall mean proceeds from the issuance of bonds, certificates of
participation or other financial securities issued by RTD.
10. INVESTMENT POLICY REVIEW AND APPROVAL
The CFO shall conduct a review of the Policy on an annual basis and present the Policy,
denoting any changes, to the Board of Directors for approval.

Packet Pg. 15

Attachment: Investment Policy 083013 (1688 : Authorization of RTD Investment Policy)

RTD's Portfolio is managed with the objective of obtaining a market rate of return,
commensurate with identified risk constraints and cash flow characteristics. Because the
composition of the Portfolio fluctuates, depending on market and credit conditions, various
indices may be used to monitor investment performance.

Second Quarter 2013 Performance Report

Information

POLICY REFERENCE
Fiscal Policy Statements – Budget Policy 10
DISCUSSION
Attached is the 2013 Performance Report for the Second Quarter. These year-to-date measures
provide a framework in which RTD determines how well it provides service to its passengers and
the citizens of the District. Of the 23 performance measures tracked, RTD met 16 of the goals in
their entirety in the second quarter; one measure (level of customer complaints) could not be
reported in Q2. The following is a discussion of the performance measures not met.
Goal 2.1 – Average facility maintenance complaints per month exceeded the goal of 10.5, primarily
due to snow/ice complaints in Q1. The complaints have started to decline in Q2 as the metric of
19.5 is down from 20.3 in Q1. We expect the trend to continue downward through the remainder
of the year.
Goal 3.1 – The District as a whole did not meet its goal for on-time service in Q2, however, we are
experiencing improvement over 2012 in all categories for all carriers. In local on-time bus service,
First Transit-Commerce City, Veolia, and First Transit-Denver did not meet the goal but showed
improvement over last year. In all other categories on-time performance met the goal in Q2. Bus
Operations staff continues to study individual route and driver performance in order to target
remedial actions and resources to the routes experiencing the greatest challenges. As the focus on
run boards continues, on-time performance is showing positive trends.
In addition, the move to the new CAD/AVL system, which will generate on-time performance data,
is causing the number of observations to decline; thus, non-compliant data is having a larger impact
on a smaller sample size.
Goal 3.3 – RTD Transit Bus fell short of the 26,000 mileage between lost service road calls. This
is a first time exception and is due to the age of the fleet and deferred fleet replacement. As the
fleet is replaced in 2013-2014 (per the SBP), this number is expected to improve.
Goal 4.1 – Average Telephone Information Center Call Wait Time increased to 94 seconds in Q2
compared to goal of ≤ 75 seconds. The slowdown in response time is due to the demands of the
West Line and its accompanying service changes (the West Line is second largest service change in
RTD history). The metric is expected to reach goal within the year due to more flexibility with the
use of part-time employees and technology improvements.
Goal 4.2 – Final Resolution of customer complaints slightly exceeded the goal by one-half business
day which is attributed to the impact of the West Line and a vacant position in this area. Customer
complaints as a whole could not be reported in Q2 due to an upgrade to the Trapeze reporting

Packet Pg. 19

1.C.1

system which caused a delay in reporting statistics due to post-upgrade testing of reports.
Customer complaints will be reported in Q3.
Goal 6.2 – RTD did not meet its overall increase in ridership goal in Q2. In the first half of 2012, a
spike in gas prices drove ridership up which created a higher base for the prior year comparison.
Ridership in all modes has been declining through Q2 of 2013.
Goal 6.3 – RTD did not meet its goal for EcoPass revenue in Q2 and revenue actually declined
slightly in this category due to continued migration from EcoPass to other fare media. Overall fare
revenue, however, is above goal at 4.2% over 2012.

An accident is considered preventable any time the operator was not driving in full compliance with all applicable laws and
regulations and in such a manner as to avoid involvement despite adverse conditions of road, weather or traffic or the errors of
pedestrians or other drivers.
2
It is not unusual for a greater number of accidents to occur during Q1 inclement weather. In addition, the majority of the
accidents were found to be non-preventable. First Transit-Commerce City continues implementation of DriveCam and Smart
Drive technologies to help operations improve driving practices.

The measure is lowered in 2013 due to system complexity added by the West Line, which will bring with it more single-track
chokepoints on the west end of the line and more crossing points in the CPV. Delays are also coming from signal timing
changes in the downtown district which is affecting performance.

Top complaints are “bus did not show,” “bus early,” “bus late” and “operator discourtesy.” Staff continues to review CAD/AVL
playbacks to determine the validity of these complaints and to work with operators to address valid complaints. Staff provides an
analysis of complaints as part of the Operations/Customer Services report. Customer complaints increased across the entire
system due to several factors including the fare enforcement campaign, the stroller policy, and heavier/longer load times; this
higher level of complaints has been consistent for the last 2 years and is not increasing.

The system which tracks complaints is currently unable to provide reports. The measurement will be reported in the third quarter.

Board Meeting Date: September 10, 2013

Subject:

Authorization of RTD Investment Policy

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
adopt the Investment Policy Statement (the “Policy”), attached.
BACKGROUND:
The Policy specifies the practices and procedures that pertain to the investment of RTD’s operating and
reserve funds. The Board last approved modifications to the Policy in September 2012. Section 10 of
the Policy states “The CFO shall conduct a review of the Policy on an annual basis and present the
policy, denoting any changes, to the Board of Directors for approval.”
DISCUSSION:
The Policy, among other things, outlines the investment objectives, standards of care, eligible
investment securities, credit and maturity parameters and diversification parameters. It is conservative in
nature and identifies its principal objectives as: safety, liquidity and yield, in priority order. The Policy
specifies reporting requirements and requires a system of internal controls designed to protect RTD
against loss of funds due to fraud, employee error or imprudent actions by employees.
Staff is not recommending any changes to the policy at this point in time but will continue to look for
ways to refine and improve the policy.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
The Policy presents no negative financial impacts to RTD.
ALTERNATIVES:
1. The Board may authorize the Investment Policy Statement (the “Policy”), attached. This is the
recommended alternative.
2. The Board may further revise the Policy.

Regional Transportation District
Investment Policy Statement

The purpose of this document is to specify the policies and procedures that support a prudent and
systematic program for investment transactions involving operating and reserve funds of the
Regional Transportation District ("RTD").
2. SCOPE
This investment policy ("Policy") applies to investment of all operating and reserve funds of the
RTD (collectively, the “Portfolio").
This Policy shall not restrict the ability of RTD to invest proceeds from the issuance of RTD
securities in financial obligations permitted through board-approved bond resolutions or
indentures of trust pursuant to which the securities were issued. The standards of care dictated
for investments of other RTD funds shall also pertain to the investment of such proceeds.
3. OBJECTIVES
The objectives, in priority order, of the RTD's investment activities shall be:
3.1 Safety
Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the investment program. Investments of RTD
will be made in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the Portfolio. To
attain this objective, RTD will endeavor to mitigate credit and interest rate risks.
Credit Risk: RTD will minimize credit risk, which is the risk of loss due to the failure of the
security issuer or backer, by:
•
•

Limiting investments to the types of securities listed in the Authorized Investments
section of this Policy.
Diversifying the Portfolio in accordance with Policy limits in order to minimize the
potential for losses from any one type of security or any one individual issuer.

Interest Rate Risk: RTD will minimize interest rate risk, which is the risk that the market
value of securities in the Portfolio will fall due to changes in market interest rates, by:
•

Maintaining Portfolio duration appropriate to the cash flow requirements of RTD,
thereby reducing the likelihood that securities would need to be sold on the open
market prior to maturity.

Packet Pg. 45

Attachment: Investment Policy 083013 (1688 : Authorization of RTD Investment Policy)

1. PURPOSE

1.B.1.a

3.2 Liquidity
The Portfolio will remain sufficiently liquid to enable RTD to meet all cash flow requirements
which might be reasonably anticipated. This will be achieved through maturity diversification
and purchases of securities that have an established secondary market.

The Portfolio shall be designed with the objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout
budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account the investment risk constraints, liquidity
needs, and cash flow characteristics of the Portfolio.
4. STANDARDS OF CARE
4.1 Prudence
All RTD officers and employees involved in the investment of RTD funds, along with any
external investment advisors, shall adhere to the guidance provided by the “prudent investor”
standard to insure that:
“When investing, reinvesting, purchasing, acquiring, exchanging, selling, or managing
public funds, a trustee shall act with care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the
circumstances then prevailing, including, but not limited to, the general economic
conditions and the anticipated needs of the agency, that a prudent person acting in a like
capacity and familiar with those matters would use in the conduct of funds of a like
character and with like aims, to safeguard the principal and maintain the liquidity needs
of the agency. Within the limitations of this section and considering individual
investments as part of an overall strategy, investments may be acquired as authorized by
law."
RTD shall recognize that no investment is totally riskless and that the investment activities of
RTD are a matter of public record. Accordingly, it recognizes that occasional measured losses
are inevitable in a diversified portfolio and shall be considered within the context of the overall
Portfolio’s return, provided that adequate diversification has been implemented, and that the sale
of a security is in the best long-term interest of RTD.
Authorized investment personnel acting in accordance with this Policy and exercising due
diligence shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security’s credit risk or
market price changes, provided that deviations from expectation are reported in a timely fashion
and appropriate action is taken to control adverse developments.

4.2 Delegation of Authority

RTD may, in its discretion, contract with one or more investment advisers, registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, to manage a
portion of its Portfolio assets. Any such advisor shall comply with this Policy and such other
written instructions as provided by RTD.
While it is understood that the procedures and trading counterparties of a contracted investment
adviser may differ from those of RTD, contracted investment advisers must maintain internal
controls and compliance systems at least as extensive as those of the RTD in order to assure
adequate protection of RTD assets in keeping with the standards of prudence outlined below.
4.3 Investment Procedures
The CFO shall establish written procedures for the operation of the investment program,
consistent with this Policy, which shall include explicit delegation of authority to persons
responsible for investment transactions. No person may engage in an investment transaction
except as provided under the terms of this Policy and the internal procedures established by the
CFO. Persons who are authorized to transact investment business and wire funds on behalf of
RTD are listed in Appendix 1 to this policy.
4.4 Internal Controls
The CFO shall establish a system of internal controls, which shall be reviewed annually. The
controls shall be designed to prevent loss of funds due to fraud, employee error,
misrepresentation by third parties, or imprudent actions by employees of RTD.
4.5 Ethics and Conflicts of Interest
Investment activities shall be performed in accordance with RTD’s Code of Ethics and other
policies of RTD. Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from
personal business activity that could conflict with the proper execution of the investment
program, or which could impair their ability to make impartial investment decisions. Employees
and investment officials shall disclose to the General Manager any material financial interests in
financial institutions that conduct business with RTD, and they shall further disclose any large
personal/financial/investment positions that could be related to the performance of the Portfolio.
Employees and officers shall subordinate their personal investment transactions to those of RTD
particularly with regard to the timing of purchases or sales.

Attachment: Investment Policy 083013 (1688 : Authorization of RTD Investment Policy)

RTD is granted legislative authority to invest its funds pursuant to Colorado Revised Statutes,
Section 32-9-119. Management responsibility for the investment program is hereby delegated to
the General Manager and his designees. The General Manager’s designee will hereinafter be
referred to as the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”).

1.B.1.a

5. AUTHORIZED INVESTMENTS

Credit criteria listed in this section refer to the credit rating at the time the security is purchased.
Rating categories defined by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations (“NRSRO”)
include intermediate rating categories. For example, the second highest rating category will
include bonds rated AA+, AA and AA- for Standard & Poor's and Fitch and Aa1, Aa2 and Aa3
for Moody's Investors Service. In the event that an issuer or security is downgraded below the
minimum rating level for any specific security that is held in the Portfolio, the CFO will review
the exposure of that security holding and will determine if it is advisable to sell such holding.
Maturity restrictions shall be calculated from settlement date to maturity date. Portfolio
percentage restrictions by security type and issuer are applicable only on the date of purchase of
the investment.
The Portfolio will be limited to an aggregate exposure of 50% for the following investment
types: Municipal Bonds, Corporate Bonds, Commercial Paper, Time Deposits/Time Certificates
of Deposit and Banker's Acceptances.
1. U.S. Treasury Obligations. Obligations in the form of bills, notes, bonds or certificates
of indebtedness backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America.
100% of the Portfolio may be invested in U.S. Treasury Obligations. The maximum
maturity for investments in U.S. Treasury Obligations shall be limited to five years.
2. U.S. Agency Obligations. Obligations issued by or fully guaranteed as to principal and
interest by those Federal Agencies or United States government-sponsored enterprises
described in 24-75-601.1(1)(b) (an ‘Agency” or “Agencies”). Eligible Agencies shall be
rated no lower than the highest category by any NRSRO. No more than 75% of the
Portfolio may be invested in Agency obligations with no more than 25% being invested
in a single U.S. Agency. Subordinate debt of any U.S. Agency is not authorized. The
maximum maturity for investments in Agencies shall be limited to five years.
In the event that one or more NRSRO rates such Agency obligations below the highest
rating category but no lower than one of the two highest rating categories, RTD's funds
may continue to be invested in Agencies if the maturity from the date of settlement to
maturity does not exceed three years. The diversification limit set forth in the prior
paragraph (no more than 75% of the Portfolio may be invested in Agency Obligations
with no more than 25% being invested in any one Agency) shall apply.
3. Municipal Bonds. Obligations of a political subdivision of any state, including bonds
payable solely out of revenues from a revenue producing property owned, controlled or
operated by the state or any local agency or by a department, board, agency or authority

1.B.1.a

6.2 Competitive Bidding
A record shall be maintained of all bids and offers for securities transactions to support RTD’s
competitive pricing process. Relative offerings shall not be required in the purchase of
obligations at their initial auction or offering. Typically, awards will be made to the bidder
offering the highest effective yield consistent with the Policy: however, transaction costs,
diversification requirements, extraordinary events and other factors may be considered when

Packet Pg. 51

Attachment: Investment Policy 083013 (1688 : Authorization of RTD Investment Policy)

RTD does not make investments for the purpose of trading or speculation, but, rather, with the
prevalent intent to hold securities to maturity. The prohibition of speculative investment
precludes pursuit of profit through unusual risk or conjectural fluctuations in market prices.
However, fluctuations in market rates or changes in credit quality may produce situations where
securities may be sold at a nominal loss in order to mitigate further erosion of principal or to
reinvest proceeds of sale in securities that will out-perform the original investment.

1.B.1.a

7. SAFEKEEPING AND CUSTODY

With the exception of collateral under repurchase agreements (discussed below), all investment
securities purchased shall be held in a safekeeping account or trust custody account at a
designated third party custodian. For safekeeping accounts, the institution shall issue a
safekeeping receipt for each security, listing the specific instrument, par value, rate, CUSIP and
any other pertinent information. In addition, the safekeeping or trust custody institutions shall
provide a statement on at least a monthly basis listing all securities held in account, including
book value and market value of holdings at month end.
For collateral (purchased securities) under repurchase agreements, RTD may utilize tri-party
repurchase agreements with an acceptable third-party custodian provided that RTD is satisfied
that it has perfected interest in the securities used as collateral, and that RTD has a properly
executed tri-party agreement.
7.2 Delivery vs. Payment
All investment transactions will be executed on a delivery versus payment basis
8. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
Investment reports shall be prepared on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis. Transaction
summaries shall be maintained and available in the office of the CFO or other authorized
investment personnel. Quarterly investment reports shall be submitted to the Board of Directors
and shall outline RTD’s total investment return and compare the Portfolio’s performance to a
publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics.
Within 120 days of the end of RTD’s fiscal year, a comprehensive report on RTD’s investment
program and investment activity shall be prepared for the Board of Directors. The annual report
shall include quarterly comparisons of investment return and may suggest improvements that
might be made in the investment program. Such annual report shall include any other item of
significance which may enhance the understanding of the investment program. Each investment
advisor shall submit like reports in a timely manner based on the respective terms of each
contract and agreement
All securities holdings reports for RTD shall disclose the maximum maturity liability to RTD
(the stated maturity) as well as the first call date of each callable security held.

1.B.1.a

9. PERFORMANCE STANDARDS

The current board-approved index for the liquidity tier of the Portfolio (cash and cash
equivalents) is the 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index as published by Bank of America Merrill
Lynch. For the enhanced cash portion of the Portfolio (securities maturing between 90 days and
5 years and with a target duration of 1 year), the designated performance benchmark is the
Merrill Lynch 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.
RTD recognizes that bond proceeds must be invested in accordance with Section 1.148 of the
U.S. Internal Revenue Code, related to arbitrage rebate, which limits the investment returns
which may be achieved or retained by RTD on such proceeds investments. For purposes of this
Policy “bond proceeds” shall mean proceeds from the issuance of bonds, certificates of
participation or other financial securities issued by RTD.
10. INVESTMENT POLICY REVIEW AND APPROVAL
The CFO shall conduct a review of the Policy on an annual basis and present the Policy,
denoting any changes, to the Board of Directors for approval.

Packet Pg. 53

Attachment: Investment Policy 083013 (1688 : Authorization of RTD Investment Policy)

RTD's Portfolio is managed with the objective of obtaining a market rate of return,
commensurate with identified risk constraints and cash flow characteristics. Because the
composition of the Portfolio fluctuates, depending on market and credit conditions, various
indices may be used to monitor investment performance.

Second Quarter 2013 Performance Report

Information

POLICY REFERENCE
Fiscal Policy Statements – Budget Policy 10
DISCUSSION
Attached is the 2013 Performance Report for the Second Quarter. These year-to-date measures
provide a framework in which RTD determines how well it provides service to its passengers and
the citizens of the District. Of the 23 performance measures tracked, RTD met 16 of the goals in
their entirety in the second quarter; one measure (level of customer complaints) could not be
reported in Q2. The following is a discussion of the performance measures not met.
Goal 2.1 – Average facility maintenance complaints per month exceeded the goal of 10.5, primarily
due to snow/ice complaints in Q1. The complaints have started to decline in Q2 as the metric of
19.5 is down from 20.3 in Q1. We expect the trend to continue downward through the remainder
of the year.
Goal 3.1 – The District as a whole did not meet its goal for on-time service in Q2, however, we are
experiencing improvement over 2012 in all categories for all carriers. In local on-time bus service,
First Transit-Commerce City, Veolia, and First Transit-Denver did not meet the goal but showed
improvement over last year. In all other categories on-time performance met the goal in Q2. Bus
Operations staff continues to study individual route and driver performance in order to target
remedial actions and resources to the routes experiencing the greatest challenges. As the focus on
run boards continues, on-time performance is showing positive trends.
In addition, the move to the new CAD/AVL system, which will generate on-time performance data,
is causing the number of observations to decline; thus, non-compliant data is having a larger impact
on a smaller sample size.
Goal 3.3 – RTD Transit Bus fell short of the 26,000 mileage between lost service road calls. This
is a first time exception and is due to the age of the fleet and deferred fleet replacement. As the
fleet is replaced in 2013-2014 (per the SBP), this number is expected to improve.
Goal 4.1 – Average Telephone Information Center Call Wait Time increased to 94 seconds in Q2
compared to goal of ≤ 75 seconds. The slowdown in response time is due to the demands of the
West Line and its accompanying service changes (the West Line is second largest service change in
RTD history). The metric is expected to reach goal within the year due to more flexibility with the
use of part-time employees and technology improvements.
Goal 4.2 – Final Resolution of customer complaints slightly exceeded the goal by one-half business
day which is attributed to the impact of the West Line and a vacant position in this area. Customer
complaints as a whole could not be reported in Q2 due to an upgrade to the Trapeze reporting

Packet Pg. 57

1.C.1

system which caused a delay in reporting statistics due to post-upgrade testing of reports.
Customer complaints will be reported in Q3.
Goal 6.2 – RTD did not meet its overall increase in ridership goal in Q2. In the first half of 2012, a
spike in gas prices drove ridership up which created a higher base for the prior year comparison.
Ridership in all modes has been declining through Q2 of 2013.
Goal 6.3 – RTD did not meet its goal for EcoPass revenue in Q2 and revenue actually declined
slightly in this category due to continued migration from EcoPass to other fare media. Overall fare
revenue, however, is above goal at 4.2% over 2012.

An accident is considered preventable any time the operator was not driving in full compliance with all applicable laws and
regulations and in such a manner as to avoid involvement despite adverse conditions of road, weather or traffic or the errors of
pedestrians or other drivers.
2
It is not unusual for a greater number of accidents to occur during Q1 inclement weather. In addition, the majority of the
accidents were found to be non-preventable. First Transit-Commerce City continues implementation of DriveCam and Smart
Drive technologies to help operations improve driving practices.

The measure is lowered in 2013 due to system complexity added by the West Line, which will bring with it more single-track
chokepoints on the west end of the line and more crossing points in the CPV. Delays are also coming from signal timing
changes in the downtown district which is affecting performance.

Top complaints are “bus did not show,” “bus early,” “bus late” and “operator discourtesy.” Staff continues to review CAD/AVL
playbacks to determine the validity of these complaints and to work with operators to address valid complaints. Staff provides an
analysis of complaints as part of the Operations/Customer Services report. Customer complaints increased across the entire
system due to several factors including the fare enforcement campaign, the stroller policy, and heavier/longer load times; this
higher level of complaints has been consistent for the last 2 years and is not increasing.

The system which tracks complaints is currently unable to provide reports. The measurement will be reported in the third quarter.
