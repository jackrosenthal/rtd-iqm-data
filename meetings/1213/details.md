#### 1. Authorization of RTD Investment Policy

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors adopt the Investment Policy Statement (the “Policy”), attached.

Motion:                Director Bagley made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the September 17, 2013 Board meeting.

Director Lasater seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Terry Howerter advised the Board that he has reviewed the 2013 Investment Policy and that there are no changes to the Policy that was approved last year.  Mr. Howerter asked if there were any questions.

Director Lasater asked Mr. Howerter if he knew what percentage RTD is paying on our bond ratings.  Director Lasater mentioned that he assumed the interest percentage on Bonds would be negotiable, similar to the interest rates which homeowners pay on their home loans.  He expounded that a few years ago, a homeowner might think that a 10% interest rate was a good interest rate; however, in today’s market, good interest rates are averaging 3-4% and homeowners are refinancing to get the lower interest rate.

Terry Howerter shared that RTD has had several bond issues out, two on the base side for the TREX project and several for FasTracks.  RTD performed a refinance at 1.62% on $224 million dollars.  RTD had another instance where we were able to refinance at 2.6%.  Our debt rate does not fluctuate but is a fix rate debt.

Brenden Morgan agreed that RTD currently has very good rates.  Most of RTD’s current                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    debt is below 3.5%at this time.

Director Sisk asked Mr. Howerter if RTD has ever had the occasion where we have had to sell bonds because they’ve fallen below the Standard & Poor’s (S&P) rating.  Mr. Howerter responded that RTD has not had that need or experience; however, RTD does have the option to do so should we determine that need prudent in the future.

Director Sisk inquired if we had any investments with any firms or agencies that have gone through legal protection such as bankruptcy. Mr. Howerter reported that this has never happened during his tenure with RTD.  He said that when you look at policy, liquidity, rate, etc., RTD investments are very safe.

Committee Chair Walker asked if any changes are anticipated in our investment strategy in the next few years.

Brenden Morgan responded that RTD’s investment portfolio is limited to the constraints of the State of Colorado Investment Rules and Regulations.  He said that currently our Investment Policy is a little more on the conservative side of what the State would allow us to do.  Mr. Morgan stated that no changes are anticipated at this point in time, but that RTD always keeps an eye open for new investment opportunities.

Committee Chair Walker declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

##### a. Investment Policy 083013

#### 1. Second Quarter 2013 Performance Report

Terry Howerter stated that the Second Quarter 2013 Performance Report is included in the September 10, 2013 Financial Administration and Audit Committee Agenda Packet.  He stated that last Friday, an additional mailing was sent with the same report but that the report had some very minor changes.  Mr. Howerter commented that in their departments learning of Minutes Tracks, they had inadvertently picked up the wrong file.   Mr. Howerter then asked Jannette Scarpino to walk everyone through the performance report.

Jannette Scarpino noted that she wanted to piggyback on what Mr. Howerter had advised on the initial report mailing; the footnotes had not been updated in the original performance report.  She stated that the Board Report is correct, but the original report that was mailed out had been missing the footnotes and asked that this be noted as an addendum to the original report.

Ms. Scarpino advised that she reports on our Key Performance Indicators (KPI) on a year-to-date basis, which shows the six months ended June 30.  The Board Report is a summary of the footnotes in the KPI report where explanations are provided for any variances to goal.  RTD exception areas showed improvement in Quarter 2.   Facility Maintenance complaints are trending down from Quarter 1 and RTD’s On-Time performance improved over 2012.  Ms. Scarpino noted that the West Line is having an impact on some of our response times in the Telephone Information Center (TIC).  The TIC call-wait time was up to 94 seconds.  Final resolution on customer complaints took one half day longer, but staff is taking steps to return to the goals.  She noted that many of the associated Assistant General Managers were present to answer any questions.  Ms. Scarpino stated that the next report will be for Quarter 3, ending September 30, where staff hopes to be able to show a return to goal and see continued improvement.

General Manager Washington mentioned that gas prices are beginning to spike. He reminded the Board that it there had been a conversation about gas prices a couple of Tuesdays ago.  Staff has seen a spike since then; right now diesel is at about $110/barrel.  General Manager Washington said that RTD is not looking to lock anytime soon for 2014 but staff will continue to monitor the prices

Director Lasater stated that he has some concerns, specifically under section 3.1 where RTD shows that there has been a continual issue in on-time performance with our contractors, First Transit-Commerce City and Veolia; they underperformed in 2011, 2012 and now in 2013.

Director Lasater mentioned that within the State of Colorado, if a school is in what is considered a turnaround period, the school has three years to turnaround to get back to an average expectation.  Veolia and First Transit-Commerce City have not met their goal.   The report indicates that the numbers are better in 2013 over 2012, but they still are not meeting goals. Both First Transit and Veolia are operating 2 ½ to 3% below RTD’s minimum established goals.

Further, Director Lasater stated that traditionally in business, if you have employees that perform below standard, they are released, especially after a three-year timeline.  He commented that as an RTD Board newcomer, he is unsure of RTD policy on contractor performance, but Director Lasater reiterated that he personally finds this trend highly disturbing.   He stated that three years of subpar performance seems inappropriate.

Director Lasater inquired if there have there been any discussions about a change of vendor or vendors.  He noted that First Transit-Denver is also showing subpar standards.  Director Lasater stated that he is curious as to if anyone else considers this continued subpar performance disturbing; we are not meeting goal with three of our vendors.

Mr. Howerter commented that the Financial Administration and Audit Committee has not had conversations about redoing contracts based on recent vendor performance.  He said it is something that can be discussed with the Board.  Mr. Howerter stated that one thing that may relate to the contractor underperformance was perhaps the age of the fleet 7.5 to 8 years.

General Manager Washington asked Mr. Bruce Abel to speak to this item.  General Manager Washington stated that there have been staff discussions in the past and that RTD does look to campaign various issues if goals are not being met.  There are some provisions within the various contracts for liquated damages and those types of things.

Bruce Abel first thanked Director Lasater for his comments and noted that he understands Director Lasater’s concerns.  Mr. Abel stated that there are a few things to keep in mind.  He reminded the Board that in 2012, when we made our serious service reductions, staff communicated to the Board at that time that it was anticipated that there would be a serious impact in on-time performance.  The bottom line is, you can’t carry the same number of people on fewer routes and not slow down performance.  He stated that staff predicted degradation in performance during 2012, and we have seen that prediction occur right down the line.

Mr. Abel stated that he would not look to recommend vendor replacement with an on-time performance of 87.7% when the goal is 88%.  He said it also should be noted that 88% is a very aggressive goal as the number relates to communities of similar size.  For instance, in Dallas, the on-time goal is 80%.  When San Francisco reached an on-time rate of 68%, they celebrated.  General Manager Washington added that when San Francisco reached that 68% goal, their General Manager received a bonus.  Mr. Abel reiterated that RTD is seeing what was predicted.

Director Daly commented that he agrees that Director Lasater’s observation of contractor on-time performance is valid.  Director Daly pointed out that RTD has consistently achieved goal while the contractors have consistently not achieved goal.  Director Daly stated that this is not a new discovery; he remembered the Board having this same conversation 5 years ago.

Director Walker had a questioned and wondered if RTD contractors operate in different regions.

Bruce Abel responded that RTD dos not contract out our regional service or services that are operated by articulated vehicles. He said that in determining service packages, staff looks at which routes make the most sense for RTD to contract out.  Staff determines where our major deadhead expenses are, given our facility location and location of the routes.  Mr. Abel stated that packages are created that generate the most savings for RTD.

Director Walker stated that he guessed RTD has better routes/roads to get around on.

Mr. Abel stated that he wouldn’t say contractor routes are more or less easy than RTD routes.

Director Menten asked why RTD doesn’t contract out our articulated routes.

Mr. Abel replied that RTD does not contract out the articulated routes in an attempt to maximize our cost savings; the more infrastructures and maintenance that we need to pass along to our contractors will impact overall costs.

Director Lasater commented for informational purposes that our Telephone Information Center call wait time has increased primarily due to our West Line coming online, which is understandable.  Director Lasater posed the question if the addition of one Line opening is causing the increase in response time, what is 4 Lines operating going to do. Certainly we must anticipate an increase of calls and we may need to look at how we prepare to support the anticipated call increases, in terms of staff and space requirements.

General Manager Washington reported that staff is already talking about these operational concerns.  General Manager Washington stated that RTD have an Activation Team for each line we open.  The Activation Team begins review of these types of logistics about two years prior to any change implementation or any opening.  Public Information and TIC are part of the Activation Team.  The team work to anticipate any upticks such as the West Line and Denver Union Station.  General Manager Washington confirmed that this action is part of RTD’s activation conversion and that RTD fully expect fluctuations in our call times.  He said we don’t want to ramp up just to ramp back down, but staff is monitoring call center needs and will respond as appropriate.

#### 2. July 2013 Monthly Financial Status Report

Terry Howerter stated that the July 2013 Monthly Financial Status Report is contained within the September 10, 2013 Financial Administration and Audit Committee Agenda Packet.  He asked Doug MacLeod to step through the presentation and the tax report.

Doug MacLeod pointed out that everything on the dash board is in green, which is good.  Sales tax estimates are at 8% which is above last July and is our best month YTD.  He noted that year-to-date RTD is at 3.4% over last year, which is over $ 8.9 million.  These are very strong results.  He said that ridership is also up due to our West Line.

Director Bagley mentioned that he had been taking with Jannette Scarpino and he wanted to share with the Board that the University of Colorado Leeds Group is coming in September or October.

##### a. 073113 RTD MFS Final

### D. Other Matters

General Manager Washington had a quick announcement.  RTD had applied for a federal grant for North Metro under the TIGER program.  Those awards were just announced and RTD did not receive a TIGER grant.  The application we submitted was for $4 million.  There will be additional opportunities and we will apply again.
