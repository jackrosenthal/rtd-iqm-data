RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial, Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to enter into contract negotiations with Parsons
Corporation to retain this firm for work order-based cybersecurity consulting services to support
RTD’s cybersecurity program. The estimated cost of the Cybersecurity Services Work Order Contract
of $1,818,700 includes security risk assessment, technical testing, control design, and control
implementation activities and will be funded from the cybersecurity operations and maintenance
budget approved for 2016 forward. Actual expenditures will be based on work orders constructed
and issued by the cybersecurity project team, but are not to exceed the total budgeted for this
contract.
BACKGROUND
The Cybersecurity Manager and IT leadership require the support of a qualified subcontracting firm to
uncover and address security deficiencies and improve the sustainability of security controls within
RTD’s technology environment. RTD has identified cybersecurity as a priority for 2016 and onward,
and with good reason: assessments from 2014, 2015, and 2016 revealed that some of RTD’s
critical systems require some level of retrofit in order to secure them to the latest industry standards.
Designing and implementing ongoing, sustainable security controls that keep RTD’s technology
secure and well-monitored reduces the risk of operational disruptions that could result in loss of
service to our customers, reduces the risk of a breach of confidential information, and enhances the
overall safety and reliability of our system.
This work order contract will allow RTD to retain the services of a single security firm and their team
of technical consultants to assist with the implementation of RTD-defined cybersecurity projects.
Service categories included in the scope of the contract include:
 Security Risk Assessment
 Security Technical Testing (Vulnerability Testing or Penetration Testing)
 Security Control Design
 Security Control Implementation
Despite the best efforts of the onboard cybersecurity staff, RTD requires external assistance to fully
and effectively address control and compliance gaps that were identified in past years’ assessments
as well as continue to mature the cybersecurity program. The primary areas targeted for continued
assessment and enhancement, such as control systems and fare collection systems, employ
specialized technologies and/or are subject to regulatory compliance requirements. Security
assessment and control design in these areas requires the involvement of personnel with specific
certifications and expertise that RTD does not presently have on staff. Security control
implementation furthermore requires a full-time dedicated project team to make reasonable progress
in retrofitting security controls to our existing environments as well as to develop self-sustaining
systems and processes to ensure systems do not fall into disrepair.

Packet Pg. 4

2.11.A

Parsons can not only provide the required certified expertise, but also bring to bear the necessary
volume of technical resources needed to plan and implement security improvements in a timely
manner. Parsons’ staff will work in conjunction with and at the direction of RTD’s Cybersecurity
Manager and Senior IT Security Analyst to ensure their efforts align with RTD’s agency-wide, IT, and
cybersecurity objectives and that resulting processes and maintenance recommendations are
realistically executable by RTD’s current and future staff following the project closure.
DISCUSSION
The intent of the Cybersecurity Services Work Order Contract is to provide a vehicle to engage
skilled cybersecurity resources using an abbreviated procurement process (work orders) in order to
maintain the necessary engagement agility to meet the District’s needs with a firm with whom we
can build a consistent, sustained relationship anchored by our cybersecurity program objectives. Past
major assessments and security retrofits within the RTD technology environment, such as the
assessment and improvements to the fare collection environments, were individually contracted on a
project-by-project basis to outside firms. It was discovered through this experience that the general
Request for Proposal process was neither agile enough, nor was contractor engagement consistent
and sustained enough, for RTD to react in a timely manner to urgent security needs driven by
business problems or incidents, or to benefit holistically from security program improvements. The
work order process will allow us to collapse wait times and sustain program development efforts by
working with one pre-approved retained firm.
Following RTD’s Procurement process, the Information Technology department issued a Request for
Proposal to identify a qualified cybersecurity firm. A selection committee evaluated and identified the
best candidate, Parsons Corporation, to meet RTD’s needs. The proposed partnership would allow
RTD to retain Parsons for an initial period of two (2) years with an option to extend services for three
(3) individual years, for a total potential contract period of five (5) years. Given that this is a work
order contract, it will be RTD’s responsibility construct, issue, and negotiate individual work orders
with Parsons for specific security services over the course the engagement period.
The requested funds include tiered consultant staff hours (i.e. project manager, senior, specialist,
intermediate, and junior) that were estimated by RTD as needed to support RTD projects among the
aforementioned service categories at the time the proposal was drafted. Actual expenditures for the
engagement will be determined by the type, scope, and number of work orders issued by RTD and
vetted by Parsons, though they shall not exceed RTD’s total budgeted amounts.
It is worth noting that the current RTD cybersecurity team consists of the Cybersecurity Manager
and the recently added Senior IT Security Analyst, both reporting the Information Technology
department. This team will provide direction and leadership to the contracted consultants. It is
expected that as RTD’s internal cybersecurity resources increase, reliance on the external contracting
firm will decrease over time.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The total estimated cost of the Cybersecurity Services Work Order Contract, with options, is
$1,818,700. This amount bridges the five (5) year potential contract period. For 2016 and 2017,
$758,200 of the total amount (the base cost) was budgeted and approved for this purpose via the
Strategic Budget Planning process. Future years’ operating expenses will be reflected in future
years’ Strategic Budget Plan.

Packet Pg. 5

2.11.A

Any additional funding planned or anticipated to implement hardware or software improvements
recommended by the consultant technical team to improve security are separately budgeted in the
appropriate category (capital or expense) for 2017 forward.
ALTERNATIVES
The available alternatives include:
 Approve the work order contract with Parsons Corporation. This is the recommended action
to ensure that RTD has the immediately available and consistent support of a qualified
cybersecurity contractor to meet current and future needs.
 Increase internal cybersecurity staffing. At least five (5) immediate full time employees will be
required to fulfill the service and skill requirements that would otherwise be fulfilled by the
work order contract. While it is recommended that we augment the internal cybersecurity
team over time, foregoing services in favor of staffing is not the recommended action because
current employment market conditions may make it difficult to find qualified staff in the near
term, and our security improvement efforts will consequently be indefinitely delayed.
 Do not approve the contract with Parsons Corporation and do not increase cybersecurity
staffing (do nothing). This is not the recommended action because the onboard staff does not
currently have the human capacity to perform the identified security improvement work in a
timely, effective manner, and RTD requires specialized skill sets to complete some of the
necessary work.

Discussion and Action of the 2016 Annual
Program Evaluation (APE) and Financial Plan

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: September 13, 2016
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: September 27, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors adopts the 2016 Annual Program Evaluation (APE) and Financial Plan as outlined below.
BACKGROUND
RTD has been conducting an Annual Program Evaluation since 2007. Given the challenges of managing
a multi-billion dollar capital program, it is desirable to perform a complete analysis of the cost of the
program. The APE captures all project expenditures to date and all planned expenditures through the
year 2019 on a project-by-project basis. It essentially provides a baseline capital budget for boardapproved projects currently underway or planned in the near future.
Since most of the funded FasTracks projects are complete or under construction, the major effort of the
APE has shifted from developing accurate estimates of costs to one of managing the projects within the
Board-approved budgets for those projects and ensuring that RTD will have the future financial capacity
to operate the corridors and meet its debt service obligations. Therefore, the FasTracks financial plan
provides an overall long-term financial plan for RTD, and includes forecasts for both FasTracks and the
base system through 2040. The staff provides the Board with regular updates on the FasTracks projects
throughout the year.
DISCUSSION
The project-by-project cost along with the amount spent through 2015 is shown in the attached
presentation. The total FasTracks budget through 2019 is approximately $5.6 billion, and approximately
$4.3 billion of this total was spent through the end of 2015.
Since most of the funded FasTracks projects are complete or under construction and are being managed
within the Board approved budgets, the project cost changes to this APE are relatively small. The
changes primarily reflect updates to project scope and timing, or work that has been completed under
budget, as shown on the attached presentation (Attachment A).
The project cost changes for the 2016 APE are summarized below:





Changes to the timing and project scope for the US 36 BRT:
o Funding for BRT vehicle enhancements deferred from 2018 until 2030 to coincide with
the replacement of the current bus fleet
o Deferral of the Church Ranch platform relocation
o Addition of additional vertical circulation at the Broomfield station, to be completed by
2018
Increase in unit cost for the additional light rail vehicles
Additional funds required for project closeout staffing

Packet Pg. 7

2.12.B







Projects with environmental and planning work completed under the 2015 APE budget:
o Northwest Rail Segment 2
o Southwest Corridor Extension
o Central Corridor Extension
Other projects completed under the APE budget:
o Existing Corridor Improvements (Southeast, Central, CPV)
o Railroad ROW
o Communication System Upgrades
o Northeast Area Transportation Evaluation (NATE)
Reduction in program wide capital costs

Future implementation of projects not included in the current APE would require identification of funding
sources for construction and operations, and would require approval of the Board. Therefore, the APE is
a dynamic tool, which is updated as projects move towards completion and any changes approved by
the Board are incorporated.
The FasTracks financial plan incorporates updated revenue forecasts that show a decrease in short and
medium-term revenue forecasts for both FasTracks and the base system. With these updated forecasts,
annual revenues are projected to be lower than the 2015 APE forecasts in each year through 2025. In
addition, the total cumulative revenue forecast is lower than the 2015 APE forecast through 2034.
Between 2035 and 2040, total forecast revenues are projected to be higher than the 2015 forecast.
This reduced revenue forecast is expected to have multiple impacts on the financial plan. RTD’s net
debt service coverage is expected to be close to the 1.20x Board policy limit through 2022. As a result,
once the remaining FasTracks debt approved in May 2016 is issued, RTD will not have the capacity to
issue additional bonds or Certificates of Participation (COPs) until 2023.
In 2012, the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) was established and “all funding identified
through the process will be added to the FISA until enough funding is accumulated to complete and
operate additional projects.” In addition to completing and operating additional projects, the specific
project goals of the FISA were to:
 Complete the US 36 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Project:
 Construct North Metro to at least 72nd;
 Any remaining funds above the $300 million goal could leverage potential grants or private sector
contributions for FasTracks partially funded projects (at the RTD Board’s discretion)
However, in 2021 through 2024 all FISA funds available will be needed to fund FasTracks corridor
operations and maintenance. In 2024 through 2030 base system funding is also needed to fund
FasTracks operations and maintenance. After 2030, FasTracks revenues are projected to cover all
operations and maintenance of the FasTracks corridors. At that time, positive fund balances begin to
accumulate on both the base system and FasTracks, with the larger share accumulating on the base
system.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The project cost changes in the 2016 Annual Program Evaluation are projected to result in a total cost
savings of $14.7 million. Approximately $1.2 million of these savings will be offset by the loss of a
CDOT FASTER grant for the Church Ranch platform relocation. The net savings of $13.5 million will be
restored to the FISA between 2016 and 2018.

Packet Pg. 8

2.12.B

After listening to input from the Board and stakeholder, the staff recommended option is the modified
baseline option. It is listed below (See Attachment B).








Need to take a total of $130.8 million from the base system in 2024-2030 to balance FasTracks
Issue COPs in base system in 2023 for $59.2 million for bus purchases. All other base capital
expenditures through 2040 are pay-go
Build Board appropriated and operating reserves in base systems to maintain equivalent of 3
months of operating reserves consistently through 2040
FISA is utilized to fund FasTracks operations and maintenance in years 2021-2024
Keep FasTracks reserves equivalent to 3 months O&M
As FasTracks unrestricted balances start to accumulate in 2031, those balances are transferred
to the FISA. No balances are transferred in years 2038 or 2039 as funds are need to fund
FasTracks EIS commitments
At year-end 2040, Base System unrestricted fund balance is projected to be $1,317.2 million,
FISA is projected to be $518.1 million, and FasTracks unrestricted fund balance is projected to be
$21.5 million for a total projected balance of $1,856.8 million

Funding from the FISA and FasTracks unrestricted fund balances would be used to fund the remaining
unfunded FasTracks corridors which have not been prioritized.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Adoption of the 2016 APE and Financial Plan, incorporating the recommendation by staff.
This is the recommended action.
2. Adoption of the 2016 APE and Financial Plan, incorporating the original baseline
recommendation by staff. This is not the recommendation action.
3. Defer the adoption of the 2016 APE and Financial Plan to a later date. This is not the
recommendation action. The financial plan must be adopted by the Board in September in
order to deliver the financial plan to the rating agencies. The rating agencies require the
financial plan in order to issue bond ratings to RTD. Those ratings are required for our
upcoming bond sale in October. Delaying approval would delay the bond sale, which could
lead to an undesirable cash position.

Subject:

2017-2022 Strategic Budget Plan (SBP)

CFO/AGM,

GM
Board Meeting Date: September 27, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
adopts the 2017-2022 Strategic Budget Plan (SBP).
This action item meets policy requirements and the General Manager’s goals of Fiscal
Sustainability/Financial Plan by effecting current and long-range budgeting in a timely manner.
POLICY REFERENCE
Fiscal Policy Statement – Capital Improvement Policies 1, Budget Policies 13 and 14
BACKGROUND
Capital Improvement Policy 1 of RTD’s Fiscal Policy Statement states that “On an annual basis, RTD will
prepare and update annually a six-year Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) including projected capital
construction and improvements, service levels and operating costs, and revenues to fund the capital and
operating programs.”
The SBP is RTD’s six year financial plan. Updated annually, it provides important cash flow planning
information used to determine the District’s operating, investing and financing activity as well as
services that the District can provide using projected financial resources. The first year of the SBP
serves as the basis for the preparation of the annual budget.
Each year during the SBP process, operating costs are estimated and capital projects are developed to
support the goals and objectives of the District. Estimates of other expenditures, such as principal and
interest payments on long-term debt, are also developed as part of the overall costs to the District. The
other major component of the SBP is the estimate of available revenues during the six-year time period.
These estimates of costs and revenues are brought together to insure that RTD will have adequate
resources to meet cash flow needs.
Per RTD Fiscal Policy Statement, RTD will contract with a qualified third party to provide sales and use
tax forecasting containing projections for the short term (one year), medium term (SBP) and long term
(FasTracks APE). RTD has contracted with the University of Colorado-Leeds School of Business for this
service. See “sales and use tax” in Discussion below.
Capital and operating/maintenance projects are evaluated based on their relative costs and benefits,
relative need, and to what extent they meet the RTD mission statement; projects are constrained to
operate within the forecast of revenues and funding sources available for their completion and operation.

Packet Pg. 27

2.12.C

The SBP also provides the basis for the District’s application for federal transit funding through the
Transportation Improvement Program (TIP), prepared by the Denver Regional Council of Governments.
The TIP is a list of all roadway and transit projects in the region that receive federal funding. RTD
cannot receive federal funds for projects unless the qualifying SBP projects are included in the TIP.
The 2017-2022 SBP includes service and projects funded from the Base System 0.6% sales and use
taxes. Projected FasTracks future expense and projects for the period 2017-2022 are presented
separately in the FasTracks financial plan.
DISCUSSION
The attached SBP incorporates the 2016 amended budget and includes all known adjustments and best
estimates at this time. The SBP was presented to the Financial Administration and Audit Committee on
August 9th for discussion; final presentation follows on September 20th with staff recommendation for
Board adoption on September 27th.
Exhibit I
Exhibit I (attached) summarizes the 2017-2022 projected cash flow through the extension of the
2016 Amended Budget.
The column titled “Adjusted Amended Budget 2016” in Exhibit I
incorporates revenue and expense adjustments approved in the Amended Budget and by amendment
to the Amended Budget, and subsequent known items.
The SBP is balanced through the six year period after incorporating into the projections 1) the March
sales/use tax forecast from CU-Leeds School of Business, 2) minimum/must-have SBP requested
projects including minimum fleet requirements, 3) reductions, eliminations or deferrals of non-critical
SBP requested projects, 4) use of the Capital Acquisition reserve fund to support planned fleet
purchases, 5) restoration of reserve funds, and 6) no new debt issued. No service reductions are
proposed in the SBP through this period.
Exhibit I summarizes the 2017-2022 projected cash flow activity based on the staff recommendation
incorporating the following:
 Revenue estimates:
 Fare revenue of $117.5 million in 2017 is projected to be unchanged from 2016. The
year 2016 is budgeted to have an 8% fare revenue increase due to the fare rate
restructure and increase. Future fare revenue increases are planned for 2019 and 2022
per the Board policy of consideration of a 10% fare rate increase every 3 years. After
2016, which contains a 1.5% ridership increase, the SBP conservatively assumes no
increase in ridership through 2022. (Line 1)
 Sales and use tax incorporates the March semi-annual update from the CU-Leeds School of
Business for the years 2016-2022. The year 2016 is budgeted using the low growth
Below-Trend forecast and years 2017-2022 is projected using the medium growth
Baseline forecast. (Line 2)
o CU-Leeds presents probabilistic high and low forecast bounds in their forecasts that
incorporate possible errors, computed as 67% confidence bounds, meaning that a
0.67 probability exists that the interval between low and high forecast values will
contain the actual value of the variable being predicted. The upper bound estimate
is 6.8% higher than the medium baseline forecast. This shows that it is not
impossible or unrealistic that revenue could grow somewhat strongly over the next
2 years. Likewise, economic threats pose downside risk to the forecast with a
6.8% lower bound.

2.12.C



Grant revenue estimates are based upon past trends, formula allocations, known proceeds,
and recent congressional actions. Amounts are escalated at the area Consumer Price
Index (CPI) (obtained from Moody’s) or as identified. (Line 3)
 Other income consists of on-going advertising revenue, joint venture revenue, and IGA and
miscellaneous rental income, escalated at the CPI beginning in 2017. (Line 4)
 Operating expenses (excluding depreciation):
 Operating expenses are increased at area CPI rates and then adjusted for known items and
necessary reductions. The area CPI rates follow: (Line 6)
2017:
3.0%
2018:
3.1%
2019:
3.0%
2020:
2.7%
2021:
2.7%
2022:
2.7%
 Service increase consists of the cost of new CMAQ-funded service projects to be operated
by RTD in years 2016-2019 to include service enhancements on Routes L and 324, Route
73 extension, Superior and Broomfield call-n-Ride services, and Anschutz Medical Campus
Shuttle. These services are included in the DRCOG TIP. RTD costs will be reimbursed in
full by CMAQ grant funds and contributed funds from the applicable municipalities.
Determination will be made in future years whether to continue such service at RTD’s
cost. (Line 7)
 Costs of operating the West Line, DUS Bus Concourse, Free MetroRide I-225, the H-Line
extension and SERE are allocated from Base to FasTracks based on resource drivers on a
full-allocation basis in years 2017-2022, and thus, Base total expenses are reduced by the
amount of the allocation. In years prior to 2017, the allocation was made on an
incremental basis, to be changed to full allocation including administrative and support
costs beginning in 2017. (Line 8)
 Expenses include the Collective Bargaining Agreement at a negotiated amount through
2017 plus an adjustment at the CPI in to capture current higher costs, and then escalated
at the CPI rate for 2018-2022. (Line 9)
 Diesel fuel is forecast at an estimated lock price of $2.00/gallon in 2017 and then
escalated at the national CPI rates as follows: (Line 10)
2018:
3.0%
2019:
2.8%
2020:
2.5%
2021:
2.3%
2022:
2.3%
 Gasoline is forecast at $2.65/gallon in 2017 based on recent average prices plus an
upward adjustment, and then escalated at the national CPI rates above. (Line 10)
 In the line item for expense projects (O&M), the following are included: 1) specifically
identified minimum/must-have operating and maintenance projects (also termed “expense
projects”), detailed in Exhibit III, 2) an amount for new operating projects brought into the
SBP based on available cash flow; specific projects will be determined from the deferred
project list in Exhibit IV. (Line 11)
 The FasTracks service increase, or “rubber tire” service based on the 2004 FasTracks
Financial Plan whereby FasTracks will fund enhanced bus service on the Base System,
increases by the CPI rate serially each year. (Line 12)
 Interest income is based on current yields adjusted for expected changes in investable
balances and forecasted interest rates per forward rate curves. (Line 15)

Packet Pg. 29

2.12.C

 Interest expense is calculated by individual debt instruments outstanding during each year (for
current debt and future debt as applicable) by using debt amortization schedules. Interest
expense is forecast only on existing debt balances because the plan assumes no new debt
issued through 2022. (Line 16)
 In the line item for capital expenditures, the following are included: 1) specifically identified
minimum/must-have capital projects plus the minimum required new fleet, detailed in Exhibit
II; dollar amounts of the new fleet will be determined so as not to exceed cash flow
constraints determined in the SBP model, 2) an amount for new capital projects brought into
the SBP based on available cash flow; specific projects will be determined from the deferred
project list in Exhibit IV, and 3) COP- or bond-funded carry-forward capital expenditures. (Line
19)
 The Fiscal Policy Statement establishes a Board-appropriated fund and capital replacement
fund.
 Staff recommends that funding of the Board-appropriated fund be maintained at a
minimum of $3 million each year until the fund reaches a balance of $35 million, projected
to occur in 2021. (Lines 20 and 33)
 Staff recommends that the capital replacement fund be refunded nominally to $2.7 million
in 2017 per available cash flow, used in years 2018-2020 for fleet purchases, then
replenished to $20 million in 2021 and the entire balance used to support fleet
expenditures in 2022. Per the 2016 Amended Budget, the capital replacement fund was
used in its entirety in 2016 for fleet acquisition. (Lines 21 and 34)
 The Fiscal Policy Statement in Fund Balance Policy 4 allows for the designation of an
unrestricted operating fund used to respond to unanticipated events, including revenue
shortfalls. The unrestricted operating reserve is established in 2017 and funded with available
cash flow. The plan will apply available dollars toward the operating fund so it reaches a
minimum $25 million in 2020, and reaches $46.4 million in 2022. (Lines 22 and 35)
 The Board-appropriated fund and unrestricted operating reserve fund (and not the capital
acquisition fund) in total are projected to reach $81.4 million in 2022.
 A placeholder is established for Transfer to FasTracks for Base System support of FasTracks
operations. Any transfer to FasTracks is not expected to occur until after 2022. (Line 23)
 Financing proceeds represent COPs issued for bus and light rail vehicle acquisition in
accordance with fleet schedules, net of grant funding and use of capital acquisition fund. No
new debt is issued during the SBP term in order to maintain required debt service coverage.
(Line 25)
 Principal payments on debt are derived from individual debt instruments outstanding during
each year (for current debt and future debt as applicable) by using debt amortization
schedules. Principal payments are forecast only on existing debt balances. (Line 26)
 Other line items consist of the roll-over of the unrestricted fund ending balance at 12/31/15,
estimated changes to restricted reserves, and the use of previously-issued COP-bond proceeds
for future year capital expenditures. (Lines 29, 30, and 31)
 The SBP is balanced during the six-year period as shown by the positive unrestricted year-end
fund balance. The objective is to maintain a nominal unrestricted year-end fund balance of $2
million each year through 2022 while supporting a minimum critical level of capital and
expense projects and building reserve fund balances. (Line 32)

As required by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), RTD must review its SBP for any Title VI
impacts (disproportionate impacts on minority and low income communities). Any service changes
specified in the SBP will be reviewed for Title VI impacts during the service planning process prior to
final recommendations on service changes. For the capital component of the SBP, Title VI impacts are
reviewed on improvements that are over and above the state-of-good-repair elements (repairs,
replacements and rehabilitations) of the capital program. The Title VI review will be provided and a
statement from the Planning Department to this effect is attached.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The staff-recommended SBP provides RTD with a plan for maintaining a positive unrestricted year-end
fund balance in each year of the SBP while substantially growing reserve fund balances. However,
uncontrollable economic factors, such as sales tax revenue, cost of fuel, materials, and supplies, as well
as economic conditions will continue to have an impact on the SBP and may challenge staff to present
new options and solutions during the 2017 budget period.
Current key financial (fund balance) indicators for the SBP are:

ALTERNATIVES

Packet Pg. 31

2.12.C

1. Adoption of the 2017-2022 SBP, incorporating all items currently in the recommendation by staff and
the other items identified above. This is the recommended action.
2. Defer the adoption of a 2017-2022 SBP to a later date. This is not recommended because the SBP
identifies the capital programs, expenditures, and service guidelines for the 2017 budget process and
adoption of the SBP serves as a confirmation of the Board of Directors' vision for the 2017 Budget.
3. Provide staff additional direction in the selection of assumptions for the projected 2017-2022 SBP.
This is not the desired action and will result in delay of the SBP adoption and possible delay in the
2017 budget process.

$67,000 for inspection services. Major spares are not needed
for this procurement since they will be operated by our
contract carriers.
Project is to purchase a TBD number of replacement vehicles Districtwide

In 2013, Rail Operations and the Planning Department
Districtwide
determined that eighteen (18) Light Rail Vehicles (LRVs)
would need to be purchased in order to meet the demands of
the existing LRT system and accommodate the opening of the
I-225 line in 2016. This analysis led to the current
procurement of twelve (12) vehicles that was included in the
2015-2017 capital budget plan. In order to bring the spare
ratio to a desired 20% minimum and meet the anticipated
growth in ridership, we need to purchase seventeen (17)
additional vehicles by 2020 (2 will be purchased by
FasTracks). This will increase the fleet from 184 to 201. The
order for these vehicles was placed in 2015.

Computer data storage, often called storage or memory, is a
technology consisting of computer components and recording
media used to retain digital information. It is a core function
and fundamental component of computers. The central
processing unit (CPU) of a computer is what manipulates raw
information by performing computations. In practice, almost
all computers use a storage hierarchy, which puts fast but
expensive and small storage options close to the CPU and
slower but larger and cheaper options farther away.
In computing, a portfolio of storage products, including online
storage, near-online (nearline) storage, storage networking,
archiving, de-duplication, storage and backup software are
required to run the Enterprise.

Mobile Ticketing

This project is a GM initiative to enhance fare products by
Blake Street
offering a mobile application for the purchase and use of fare Office
and parking products. Mobile ticketing applications are
available from many third parties and can be used on any
mobile device. There is very little need for infrastructure or
customization of software. A user simply downloads the
mobile ticketing application to their device and purchases and
manages any of RTD's fare products or pays for parking. The
user purchases the product needed with a credit card and
receives the value of their payment on their mobile device for
immediate use. The user then activates (validates) each ride
by simply selecting the fare product to be used each time a
boarding occurs. The mobile application vendor maintains the
software and is the administrator of payments thereby
meeting PCI compliance. Any of RTD's fare products may be
used with mobile ticketing which offers a single, convenient
source and use of products. The vendor manages the data
and payments and sends a single payment for all transactions
during a given time period to RTD. Vendors also provide data
and analytical tools regarding the transactions on the
application. Industry standards for cost structure are an initial
small set-up fee then a % of mobile ticketing sales.

Property Survey
Records System-Wide

Currently whenever RTD acquires or disposes off any
Districtwide
property right (fee simple, easement, or license agreement), it
utilizes an external survey firm (Jacobs) to establish the
location of that property right on the ground, and prepare
Right-of-Way maps, legal descriptions and exhibits. The
contract with Jacobs will expire at the end of 2016. Jacobs
has surveys, Computer Aided Design (CAD) files, information
on adjoining properties, subdivision plats, ALTA surveys, legal
descriptions, and other electronic and paper records
regarding RTD properties going back to 1997. The extent of
this information is estimated to be 2 to 4 terabytes, which
could be equated to 76,000 to 152,000 bankers boxes of
information. These documents also include information on
utilities that cross or service RTD stations, rail lines, Park-nRides, and other properties.

information is critical to the system and needs to be brought
within RTD. This project will strengthen the foundation of
many District-wide efforts by obtaining and organizing RTD
property rights, utility, and other information in an easily
accessible format.

OPERATING AND MAINTENANCE PROJECTS

Project Description

DRCOG, through the Transportation Improvement Program
Districtwide
(TIP), has allocated $1 million in funding for FY 2017 for this
project. RTD would be required to provide a 25 percent local
match of $250,000. Given the results of the Northwest Area
Mobility Study, which showed substantial bus ridership
increases from modest capital improvements made to arterial
corridors, there has been much interest from other areas of
the District for RTD to make arterial BRT investments in other
corridors. The purpose of this study will be to examine the
potential for arterial BRT investments throughout the entire
District and prioritize for future capital investment those
corridors which perform the highest.

Planning

This plan would build upon the Bike Parking and Accessibility Districtwide
Study to develop strategies to improve multi-modal
accessibility at our stations. The scope of strategies could
include:
- additional bus transfer facilities
- pedestrian improvements
- bike access improvements
- improved bike storage
- expanded or new drop off/pick up areas
- transit speed and reliability improvements on bus routes
connecting to the station
The plan would identify potential partnerships with other public
and private entities to implement these strategies. Finally, the
plan would prioritize potential improvements based on their
impact.

This project consists of replacing the counter tops, sinks and Denver Union
toilet partition doors in the Men’s restroom at Denver Union
Station Complex
Station. This project was identified in 2015 as part of the
Facilities Maintenance Needs Assessment.
This project is for a redesigned and revised “Phase 2”
Denver Union
Portal Protection
Station Complex
Project, Revised Phase 2 resulting in a reduction of $1 million in the project cost. The
savings was accomplished by eliminating Automatic Bus RFID
Reader Technology and In Ground Emergency Portal Pop-up
Barriers. A physical network connection to existing “Starters
Stations” and the DUS Security Office was also eliminated.

2016, 140 employees have received the four-hour "Green
Belt" training and another 28 employees the week-long "Black
Belt" training with principal efforts focused in Platte Bus
Maintenance and Customer Care pilots. These pilots have
identified more than 100 potential innovations to date with an
estimated $750,000 in soft dollar (efficiency) savings and
more than $20,000 in hard dollar (capital) savings. Last year,
Denver’s program realized $4.5 million in savings through the
program. Staff has also begun Continuous Improvement

The ADA Manager continues to boost involvement on
accessible design (plan reviews, site visits, and inspections)
District-wide. The need for a perspective on accessible design
has been well received and needs more and continued
attention and support. This proactive approach ensures
compliance and mitigates potential problems. This
effort/involvement has been effective in identifying and
preventing costly and litigious issues from escalating, but
efforts are spread thin and not all projects receive this type of
attention.
Currently whenever RTD acquires or disposes off any property Districtwide
right (fee simple, easement, or license agreement), it utilizes
an external survey firm (Jacobs) to establish the location of
that property right on the ground, and prepare Right-of-Way
maps, legal descriptions and exhibits. The contract with
Jacobs will expire at the end of 2016. Jacobs has surveys,
Computer Aided Design (CAD) files, information on adjoining
properties, subdivision plats, ALTA surveys, legal
descriptions, and other electronic and paper records regarding
RTD properties going back to 1997. The extent of this
information is estimated to be 2 to 4 terabytes, which could be
equated to 76,000 to 152,000 bankers boxes of information.
These documents also include information on utilities that
cross or service RTD stations, rail lines, Park-n-Rides, and
other properties.
Organizations that have assets in various geographic
locations typically utilize Geographic Information Systems
(GIS) to record and analyze their asset base. Utilities and local
municipalities are examples of such organizations. RTD has
been using GIS systems for about 15 years. Currently, these
systems are used mostly used by the Telephone Information
Center (TIC), Scheduling (Transtar), and CAD/AVL. RTD is
also getting started on projects like real-time train arrival
information, which would also need GIS support.

Information Storage Unit RTD relies heavily on its storage units to house 95% of all
District information and computing services. A wide range of
Replacement
departments and applications use these storage units to store
mission-critical data.
Computer data storage, often called storage or memory, is a
technology consisting of computer components and recording
media used to retain digital information. It is a core function
and fundamental component of computers. The central
processing unit (CPU) of a computer is what manipulates raw
information by performing computations. In practice, almost all
computers use a storage hierarchy, which puts fast but
expensive and small storage options close to the CPU and
slower but larger and cheaper options farther away.
In computing, a portfolio of storage products, including online
storage, near-online (nearline) storage, storage networking,
archiving, de-duplication, storage and backup software are
required to run the Enterprise.

This project is a GM initiative to enhance fare products by
Blake Street
offering a mobile application for the purchase and use of fare Office
and parking products. Mobile ticketing applications are
available from many third parties and can be used on any
mobile device. There is very little need for infrastructure or
customization of software. A user simply downloads the
mobile ticketing application to their device and purchases and
manages any of RTD's fare products or pays for parking. The
user purchases the product needed with a credit card and
receives the value of their payment on their mobile device for
immediate use. The user then activates (validates) each ride
by simply selecting the fare product to be used each time a
boarding occurs. The mobile application vendor maintains the
software and is the administrator of payments thereby meeting
PCI compliance. Any of RTD's fare products may be used with
mobile ticketing which offers a single, convenient source and
use of products. The vendor manages the data and payments
and sends a single payment for all transactions during a given
time period to RTD. Vendors also provide data and analytical
tools regarding the transactions on the application. Industry
standards for cost structure are an initial small set-up fee then
a % of mobile ticketing sales.

RTD needs technology to operate efficiently and to compete
Civic Center
effectively. But as reliance on IT grows, the resources needed Plaza (CCP)
to support this increasingly complex IT environment may not.
In many areas, IT resources are limited and can be quickly
overwhelmed. We have seen from prior instances that if we
fall behind in keeping up with things such as backups, patches
and security, the odds greatly increase that RTD will face an
IT outage or another problem down the road that will
negatively impact RTD business. For instance, once RTD rolls
out real-time information to the customer and we have an
outage, it will negatively impact customers' view of RTD.
Another example is constantly keeping up to date with security
patches which, if not applied, will leave security vulnerabilities
open in the system. Managed Services support will help IT to
keep current with all these patches on a regular basis.

With the expansion of staff, represented employees, vehicles
and Light Rail lines, coupled with the ongoing challenges of
hiring new qualified mechanics, a robust training program is
essential. Part of this program needs to incorporate an ELearing system such as what Xpan offers (see attachment)
that is all-encompassing plus specific to the diagnostic details
of the SD160 fleet the we own. It can also aid in filling the gap
between an unqualified mechanic helper to an electromechanic.
Request is to replace roof top unit RTU-1, and VAV boxes at
the Mariposa facility. Project will include re-evaluation of
building cooling loads and upgrading existing HVAC systems
in the two-story office area.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

From:

Heather
Copp,
Administration

Date:

September 12, 2016

Subject:

Budget Transfer for SH 119 Bus Rapid Transit
Environmental Clearance and Basic Engineering

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: September 13, 2016
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: September 27, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors approve a transfer of $3.5 million from the Planning expense grant project budget to a new
capital project for the SH 119 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Corridor, which will permit staff to seek
consultant services for assistance in the preparation of National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)
review and Advanced Basic Engineering services. A total of $1.5 million in funding for this project
was approved in the 2016 Amended Budget in the Planning expense grant budget, and the remaining
funds are planned for 2017 and 2018 in the 2017-2022 Strategic Budget Plan (SBP).
BACKGROUND
RTD initiated the Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS), in April 2013. The purpose of the study
was to develop consensus among RTD, the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) and the
Northwest-area stakeholders, including local jurisdictions and businesses, on cost effective and
efficient mobility improvements to serve the Northwest area. On June 24, 2014, the Board approved
a resolution which accepted the Final Consensus Statement as developed by the NAMS stakeholders
for priorities within the Northwest Study Area. One of the highest priorities, as described in the
Final Consensus Statement, was to proceed into advanced planning, environmental clearance and
preliminary engineering to establish Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) in the SH 119 Corridor from Longmont
to Boulder.
As part of the 2040 Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) process, the Denver Regional Council of
Governments (DRCOG) included the SH 119 BRT Corridor in the Fiscally Constrained 2040 RTP.
Inclusion of the corridor in the RTP is required before National Environmental Planning Act (NEPA)
clearance can be completed.
In order to advance this effort, DRCOG awarded RTD $1 million in Congestion Mitigation / Air
Quality grant funds for Fiscal Year 2016 to further environmental planning and engineering efforts in
the corridor. RTD would need to obligate these funds by September 2017 or risk losing the funding
to another project.
The cost to establish BRT in the corridor is estimated to be approximately $57 million in 2013
dollars. Staff assumes that grants will provide funding for approximately half of this cost. The
Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) includes $60 million in Base System funds (with $30 million assumed to
be from grant sources) for construction of the corridor beginning in 2022.
This action fits within the General Manager Goal to Improve Service Delivery, specifically the sub
goal of enhancing or expanding operations, as the eventual completion of BRT in the SH 119 corridor
will increase service reliability, ridership and cost effectiveness of the service.

DISCUSSION
RTD will require extensive consultant services to complete the NEPA environmental clearances and
basic engineering prior to BRT construction in the SH 119 Corridor. Staff estimates those consultant
services to cost $3.5 million. RTD has received $1 million in DRCOG grant funds for Fiscal Year
2016 for this effort, with RTD providing the remainder of the project cost. Staff expects the effort
to span approximately 2.5 years, and these funds were programmed in the 2016 expense budget
and in the years 2017 and 2018 in the 2017-2022 SBP to match the anticipated project schedule.
However, the full contract amount must be appropriated up front in order to issue a Request for
Proposals (RFP) because the project is a capital project. The budget transfer will allow staff to issue
an RFP for consultant services in November 2016 and award the contract in February, 2017. Based
on the 2.5 year schedule described above, the environmental clearances and basic engineering would
be completed by July 2019.
Should RTD pursue BRT construction in this corridor, as prioritized by the NAMS Final Consensus
Statement, the SH 119 BRT project would be subject to approval by a two-thirds vote of the RTD
Board. In addition, DRCOG SB 208 approval would be required as this project would be defined as a
rapid transit corridor project. The expectation is that the funding breakdown for future BRT
construction in the corridor would be as follows:



50 percent from RTD Base System Funds; and
50 percent from grant sources, such as DRCOG Transportation Improvement Program (TIP)
funds, and/or Federal Transit Administration (FTA) Small Starts funding.

Project construction would occur within the 2022 to 2025 timeframe. And, as noted, future Board
action would be required to approve construction of BRT in this corridor.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The funding that will be used for this project is available from projects funds rolled forward from 2015 to
2016 that are no longer required for that purpose and are available for this priority. Because these funds
were programmed in 2017 and 2018 SBP, funds will be made available in those years by funding the
project now.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit
Committee that the RTD Board of Directors approve a transfer of $3.5 million from the
Planning expense grant project budget to a new capital project for the SH 119 Bus Rapid
Transit (BRT) Corridor, which will permit staff to seek consultant services for assistance in
the preparation of National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review and Advanced Basic
Engineering services. A total of $1.5 million in funding for this project was approved in the
2016 Amended Budget in the Planning expense grant budget, and the remaining funds are
planned for 2017 and 2018 in the 2017-2022 Strategic Budget Plan (SBP).
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not approve the requested budget transfer at
this time. Instead, include this request as part of the 2017 Recommended Budget. This
action is not recommended since it will delay the procurement of consultant services for the
SH 119 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) corridor by at least two months.
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not approve the requested budget transfer;
instead wait until the full $3.5 million for consultant services is available in 2018 on the
schedule included in the SBP. This action is not recommended since it would delay

procurement of consultant services for the SH 119 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) corridor until early
2018 and would likely delay future construction of the corridor, thereby subjecting
construction to cost escalation. This action would likely cause the forfeiture of the $1 million
in DRCOG TIP funds, which were awarded to advance the NEPA / Basic Engineering effort in
the corridor, which would increase RTD’s local funding required to advance the project.
4. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not approve the requested budget transfer and
do not proceed forward with procuring consultant services to assist staff in the preparation of
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review and Advanced Basic Engineering services for
the SH 119 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) corridor. This action is not recommended given the
considerable commitment on the part of RTD and the Northwest Area stakeholders to reach
the consensus prioritizing SH 119 as the highest-priority BRT corridor in the Northwest Area.
Furthermore, this action would require RTD to forfeit $1 million in DRCOG TIP funds, which
were awarded to advance the NEPA / Basic Engineering effort in the corridor.
