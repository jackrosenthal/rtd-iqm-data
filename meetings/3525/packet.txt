BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Third Amendment to Salaried Employees' Defined
Contribution Plan

October 3, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
October 24, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve a third amendment to the Salaried Employees’ Defined
Contribution Plan to change the vesting schedule to 20% vesting at one year of employment, and an
additional 20% at each year of employment thereafter, with 100% vesting at five years.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
Non-represented employees hired before January 1, 2008, participate in a defined benefit pension plan.
This pension plan was closed to new non-represented employees hired on or after January 1, 2008, who
instead participate in a defined contribution plan. The defined contribution plan qualifies as an Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) section 401(a) plan.
This defined contribution plan is funded by contributions from RTD of 9% of qualifying wages. The
current plan documents provide for a five-year cliff vesting, during which period employees do not vest
or own any portion of these contributions until they reach five years of continuous employment with
RTD. Therefore, if a non-represented employee terminates employment prior to reaching five years of
employment, all employer contributions are forfeited to the plan and used for administrative expenses.
IRS rules do not permit returning forfeited employer contributions to the employer.
The represented employee defined benefit pension plan was closed to new employees hired January 1,
2023, and thereafter and a defined contribution 401(a) plan is provided. This represented employee
defined contribution plan provides a vesting schedule of 20% for each full year of continuous
employment with RTD. Therefore, represented employees vest at 20% at one year of employment, 40%
at two years of employment, and so on until they reach 100% vesting at five years of employment.
DISCUSSION
The non-represented employee defined contribution plan trustees, including Directors Broom and Dishell,
recommend that the vesting schedule be changed from a five-year cliff vesting to a schedule wherein
employees vest at 20% at one year of full employment, and at an additional 20% each year of
employment thereafter, with 100% vesting at five years. This proposed schedule aligns with the
represented employee defined contribution plan vesting schedule and has been determined to be more

Packet Pg. 28

16.A

favorably viewed by employees than a five-year cliff vesting schedule. It may also contribute to RTD’s
ability to attract and retain talent by enhancing the total rewards benefit package. It thus aligns with the
Strategic Plan Success Outcomes of Employee Ownership and Financial Success.
Should this recommendation be approved by the Board, the non-represented employee defined
contribution plan will be amended, and the Plan recordkeeper will enact the vesting changes effective
February 1, 2024. The new vesting schedule would apply to non-represented employees from that date,
and those hired on or after that date. For example, a current, active non-represented employee who has
reached three years of continuous employment will be vested at 60% at the time that the plan changes
are effective on February 1, 2024.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with this recommended action. Changes to the vesting schedule
may result in lower forfeitures within the non-represented defined contribution plan; however, it is
estimated that these forfeitures will continue to be adequate to fund plan administrative expenses.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
2024 Investment Policy

October 3, 2023
Board Meeting Date:

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the 2024 Investment Policy.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
Brenden Morgan, Senior Manager of Debt and Investments
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
Each year staff presents for the Board’s consideration the proposed Investment Policy for the upcoming
fiscal year in accordance with Fiscal Policy requirements. The Investment Policy may be amended by the
Board at any time.
The most recent modification to the Investment Policy was approved by the Board in October 2022 for
the 2023 fiscal year.
DISCUSSION
The purpose of the Investment Policy is to specify the policies and procedures that support a prudent
and systematic program for investment of RTD’s operating funds, debt proceeds, and reserve funds.
The primary objectives of RTD’s Investment Policy in order of priority are: 1) safety of principal, 2)
sufficient liquidity to meet known cash flow requirements, and 3) yield to achieve a market rate of
return. Although RTD must follow the investment parameters dictated by state law (§24-75-601.1,
C.R.S.), this Investment Policy is more conservative in order to achieve the Strategic Priority of Financial
Success.
Staff is recommending minor grammatical changes to the 2024 Investment Policy as shown in the
attached. No other changes are requested at this time.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with this action item.

2024 INVESTMENT POLICY

1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this document is to specify the policies and procedures that support a prudent
and systematic program for investment transactions involving operating and reserve funds of the
Regional Transportation District ("RTD").
2. SCOPE
This investment policy ("Policy") applies to investment of all operating and reserve funds of RTD
(collectively, the “Portfolio").
This Policy shall not restrict the ability of RTD to invest proceeds from the issuance of RTD
securities in financial obligations permitted through Board-approved bond resolutions or indentures
of trust pursuant to which the securities were issued. The standards of care dictated for
investments of other RTD funds shall also pertain to the investment of such proceeds.
3. OBJECTIVES
The objectives, in priority order, of the RTD's investment activities shall be:
3.1 Safety
Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the investment program. Investments of RTD will
be made in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the Portfolio. To attain
this objective, RTD will endeavor to mitigate credit and interest rate risks.
Credit Risk: RTD will minimize credit risk, which is the risk of loss due to the failure of the
security issuer or backer, by:
•
•

Limiting investments to the types of securities listed in the Authorized Investments
section of this Policy.
Diversifying the Portfolio in accordance with Policy limits in order to minimize the
potential for losses from any one type of security or any one individual issuer.

Interest Rate Risk: RTD will minimize interest rate risk, which is the risk that the market value
of securities in the Portfolio will fall due to changes in market interest rates, by:
Maintaining Portfolio duration appropriate to the cash flow requirements of RTD, thereby
reducing the likelihood that securities would need to be sold on the open market prior
to maturity

3.2 Liquidity
The Portfolio will remain sufficiently liquid to enable RTD to meet all cash flow requirements
which might be reasonably anticipated. This will be achieved through maturity diversification and
purchases of securities that have an established secondary market.
3.3 Yield
The Portfolio shall be designed with the objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout
budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account the investment risk constraints, liquidity
needs, and cash flow characteristics of the Portfolio.

4. STANDARDS OF CARE
4.1 Prudence
All RTD officers and employees involved in the investment of RTD funds, along with any external
investment advisors, shall adhere to the guidance provided by the “prudent investor” standard to
insure that:
“When investing, reinvesting, purchasing, acquiring, exchanging, selling, or managing
public funds, a trustee shall act with care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the
circumstances then prevailing, including, but not limited to, the general economic
conditions and the anticipated needs of the agency, that a prudent person acting in a like
capacity and familiar with those matters would use in the conduct of funds of a like
character and with like aims, to safeguard the principal and maintain the liquidity needs of
the agency. Within the limitations of this section and considering individual investments
as part of an overall strategy, investments may be acquired as authorized by law."
RTD shall recognize that no investment is totally riskless and that the investment activities of
RTD are a matter of public record. Accordingly, it recognizes that occasional measured losses are
inevitable in a diversified portfolio and shall be considered within the context of the overall
Portfolio’s return, provided that adequate diversification has been implemented, and that the sale
of a security is in the best long-term interest of RTD.

Authorized investment personnel acting in accordance with this Policy and exercising due
diligence shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security’s credit risk or market
price changes, provided that deviations from expectation are reported in a timely fashion and
appropriate action is taken to control adverse developments.

RTD is granted legislative authority to invest its funds pursuant to Colorado Revised Statutes,
Section 32-9-119. Management responsibility for the investment program is hereby delegated to
the General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) and her designees. The GM/CEO’s designee will
hereinafter be referred to as the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”).
RTD may, in its discretion, contract with one or more investment advisers, registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, to manage a
portion of its Portfolio assets. Any such advisor shall comply with this Policy and such other
written instructions as provided by RTD.
While it is understood that the procedures and trading counterparties of a contracted investment
adviser may differ from those of RTD, contracted investment advisers must maintain internal
controls and compliance systems at least as extensive as those of the RTD in order to assure
adequate protection of RTD assets in keeping with the standards of prudence outlined below.
4.3 Investment Procedures
The CFO shall establish written procedures for the operation of the investment program,
consistent with this Policy, which shall include explicit delegation of authority to persons
responsible for investment transactions. No person may engage in an investment transaction
except as provided under the terms of this Policy and the internal procedures established by the
CFO. Persons who are authorized to transact investment business and wire funds on behalf of
RTD are listed in Appendix 1 to this policy.
4.4 Internal Controls
The CFO shall establish a system of internal controls, which shall be reviewed annually. The
controls shall be designed to prevent loss of funds due to fraud, employee error, misrepresentation
by third parties, or imprudent actions by employees of RTD.
4.5 Ethics and Conflicts of Interest
Investment activities shall be performed in accordance with RTD’s Code of Ethics and other
policies of RTD. Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from
personal business activity that could conflict with the proper execution of the investment

5. AUTHORIZED INVESTMENTS
Authorized investments for RTD funds are specifically listed below. RTD recognizes that
investment risk can result from issuer defaults, market price changes or various technical
impediments leading to diminished liquidity or loss of capital. Portfolio risk management and
diversification are employed as a way to minimize the risks inherent in investing.
Credit Criteria: Credit criteria listed in this section refer to the credit rating at the time the security
is purchased. Rating categories defined by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations
(“NRSROs”) include intermediate rating categories. For example, the second highest rating
category (“AA”) includes bonds rated AA+, AA and AA- for Standard & Poor's and Fitch, and
Aa1, Aa2 and Aa3 for Moody's Investors Service. In the event that an issuer or security is
downgraded below the minimum rating level for any specific security that is held in the Portfolio,
the CFO will review the exposure of that security holding and will determine if it is advisable to
sell such holding.
Maturity Restrictions: Maturity restrictions shall be calculated from settlement date to maturity
date. Portfolio percentage restrictions by security type and issuer are applicable only on the date
of purchase of the investment.
Sector Diversification: The Portfolio will be limited to an aggregate exposure of 50% for the
following investment types: Municipal Bonds, Corporate Bonds, Commercial Paper, Time
Deposits/Time Certificates of Deposit and Banker's Acceptances.
1. U.S. Treasury Obligations. Obligations in the form of bills, notes, bonds or certificates of
indebtedness backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America. 100%
of the Portfolio may be invested in U.S. Treasury Obligations. The maximum maturity for
investments in U.S. Treasury Obligations shall be limited to five years.
2. Federal Agency and Instrumentality Securities: Obligations, participations or other
instruments of any Federal agency, instrumentality or United States government-sponsored
enterprise as described in CRS 24-75-601.1(1)(b) (an “Agency” or “Agencies”). Such
securities shall be rated in one of the two highest rating categories (as described above in
the Credit Criteria section) by at least two NRSROs. No more than 75% of the Portfolio
may be invested in Federal Agency and Instrumentality Securities, with no more than 25%

and investment officials shall disclose to the GM/CEO any material financial interests in financial
institutions that conduct business with RTD, and they shall further disclose any large
personal/financial/investment positions that could be related to the performance of the Portfolio.
Employees and officers shall subordinate their personal investment transactions to those of RTD
particularly with regard to the timing of purchases or sales.

governments. Such obligations of Colorado (or any political subdivision, institution,
department, agency, instrumentality, or authority of the state) shall be rated in one of the
three highest rating categories (as described in the Credit Criteria section) by at least two
NRSROs. Such obligations of any other governmental entity shall be rated in one of the
two highest rating categories (as described in the Credit Criteria section) by at least two

must be rated at least “A-1”, “MIG 1”, or the equivalent, by a NRSRO.
Pre-Refunded Municipal Bonds which are secured by an escrow of U.S. Treasury securities
or State and Local Government Series securities, shall be rated in one of the two highest
rating categories (as described in the Credit Criteria section) by a NRSRO. No more than
40% of the Portfolio may be invested in Pre-Refunded Municipal Bonds and no more than
5% may be invested with a single issuer.
With the exception of Pre-Refunded Municipal Bonds described above, no more than 20%
of the Portfolio may be invested in Municipal Bonds with no more than 3% of the Portfolio
invested with a single issuer. The maximum maturity for investments in Municipal Bonds

two NRSROs. These ratings requirements first apply to the security being purchased and
second, if the security itself is unrated, to the issuer provided the security contains no
provisions subordinating it from being a senior debt obligation of the issuer. No more than

6. INVESTMENT PARAMETERS
6.1 Sale of Securities
RTD does not make investments for the purpose of trading or speculation, but, rather, with the
prevalent intent to hold securities to maturity. The prohibition of speculative investment precludes
pursuit of profit through unusual risk or conjectural fluctuations in market prices. However,
fluctuations in market rates or changes in credit quality may produce situations where securities
may be sold at a nominal loss in order to mitigate further erosion of principal or to reinvest
proceeds of sale in securities that will out-perform the original investment.
6.2 Competitive Bidding
RTD shall obtain competitive bid or offer information on all purchases or sales of investment
instruments on the secondary market. A competitive bid or offer can be executed through a
bidding process involving at least three separate brokers/financial institutions. If RTD is offered
a security for which there is no readily available competitive offering on the same specific issue,

1660 Blake Street, Denver CO 80202

Packet Pg. 40

Attachment: RTD 2023 Investment Policy.doc (4827 : 2024 Investment Policy)

No more than 50% of the Portfolio may be invested in repurchase agreements and no more
than 10% may be invested with a single counterparty. The maximum maturity for a
repurchase agreement shall be limited to 90 days.

16.B.a

Subject: 2024 Investment Policy
Page 8

the investment officer may document quotations for comparable or alternative securities. When
purchasing original/new issue securities, no competitive offerings will be required as all dealers in
the selling group offer those securities at the same original issue price.

The maturity of the securities in the Portfolio shall be managed with respect to the cash flow
needs of RTD and the Portfolio shall be managed to maintain a duration of three years or less.
6.4 Authorized Financial Dealers and Institutions
RTD or an investment advisor hired by RTD will maintain a list of financial institutions authorized
to provide investment services and it shall be the policy of RTD to purchase securities only from
those authorized institutions and firms. Trading counterparties shall be limited to (i) primary
dealers reporting to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, or (ii) broker/dealers that qualify under
Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15c3-1 (uniform net capital rule).
6.5 Authorized Investment Advisors
RTD may engage the services of one or more professional investment advisory firms to assist in
the management of the Portfolio. Such investment advisors may be granted discretion to
purchase and sell investment securities in accordance with this Policy and may utilize their own
approved list of broker/dealers. Such firms must be authorized to conduct business in the State
of Colorado and shall be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

7. SAFEKEEPING AND CUSTODY
7.1 Safekeeping and custody
With the exception of collateral under repurchase agreements (discussed below), all investment
securities purchased shall be held in a safekeeping account or trust custody account at a
designated third party custodian. For safekeeping accounts, the institution shall issue a
safekeeping receipt for each security, listing the specific instrument, par value, rate, CUSIP and
any other pertinent information. In addition, the safekeeping or trust custody institutions shall
provide a statement on at least a monthly basis listing all securities held in account, including
book value and market value of holdings at month-end.
For collateral (purchased securities) under repurchase agreements, RTD may utilize tri-party
repurchase agreements with an acceptable third-party custodian provided that RTD is satisfied
that it has perfected interest in the securities used as collateral, and that RTD has a properly
executed tri-party agreement.

16.B.a

Subject: 2024 Investment Policy
Page 9

7.2 Delivery vs. Payment
All investment transactions will be executed on a delivery versus payment basis.

Investment reports shall be prepared on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis. Transaction
summaries shall be maintained and available in the office of the CFO or other authorized
investment personnel. Quarterly investment reports shall be submitted to the Board of Directors
and shall outline RTD’s total investment return and compare the Portfolio’s performance to a
publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics.
Staff will include an annual listing of investments held and investment returns within the Annual
Comprehensive Financial Report.
All securities holdings reports for RTD shall disclose the average maturity of the investment
portfolio.
9. PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
RTD's Portfolio is managed with the objective of obtaining a market rate of return, commensurate
with identified risk constraints and cash flow characteristics. Because the composition of the
Portfolio fluctuates, depending on market and credit conditions, various indices may be used to
monitor investment performance.
The current board-approved index for the liquidity tier of the Portfolio (cash and cash equivalents)
is the ICE BofAML 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index. For the enhanced cash portion of the Portfolio
(securities maturing between 90 days and 5 years and with a target duration of 1 year), the
designated performance benchmark is the ICE BofAML 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.
RTD recognizes that bond proceeds must be invested in accordance with Section 1.148 of the
U.S. Internal Revenue Code, related to arbitrage rebate, which limits the investment returns which
may be achieved or retained by RTD on such proceeds investments. For purposes of this Policy
“bond proceeds” shall mean proceeds from the issuance of bonds, certificates of participation or
other financial securities issued by RTD.
10. INVESTMENT POLICY REVIEW AND APPROVAL
The CFO shall conduct a review of the Policy on an annual basis and present the Policy, denoting
any changes, to the Board of Directors for approval.

2024 INVESTMENT POLICY

1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this document is to specify the policies and procedures that support a prudent
and systematic program for investment transactions involving operating and reserve funds of the
Regional Transportation District ("RTD").
2. SCOPE
This investment policy ("Policy") applies to investment of all operating and reserve funds of the
RTD (collectively, the “Portfolio").
This Policy shall not restrict the ability of RTD to invest proceeds from the issuance of RTD
securities in financial obligations permitted through Bboard-approved bond resolutions or
indentures of trust pursuant to which the securities were issued. The standards of care dictated
for investments of other RTD funds shall also pertain to the investment of such proceeds.
3. OBJECTIVES
The objectives, in priority order, of the RTD's investment activities shall be:
3.1 Safety
Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the investment program. Investments of RTD will
be made in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the Portfolio. To attain
this objective, RTD will endeavor to mitigate credit and interest rate risks.
Credit Risk: RTD will minimize credit risk, which is the risk of loss due to the failure of the
security issuer or backer, by:
•
•

Limiting investments to the types of securities listed in the Authorized Investments
section of this Policy.
Diversifying the Portfolio in accordance with Policy limits in order to minimize the
potential for losses from any one type of security or any one individual issuer.

16.B.b

Subject: 20243 Investment Policy
Page 2

Interest Rate Risk: RTD will minimize interest rate risk, which is the risk that the market value
of securities in the Portfolio will fall due to changes in market interest rates, by:
Maintaining Portfolio duration appropriate to the cash flow requirements of RTD, thereby
reducing the likelihood that securities would need to be sold on the open market prior
to maturity.

3.2 Liquidity
The Portfolio will remain sufficiently liquid to enable RTD to meet all cash flow requirements
which might be reasonably anticipated. This will be achieved through maturity diversification and
purchases of securities that have an established secondary market.
3.3 Yield
The Portfolio shall be designed with the objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout
budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account the investment risk constraints, liquidity
needs, and cash flow characteristics of the Portfolio.

4. STANDARDS OF CARE
4.1 Prudence
All RTD officers and employees involved in the investment of RTD funds, along with any external
investment advisors, shall adhere to the guidance provided by the “prudent investor” standard to
insure that:
“When investing, reinvesting, purchasing, acquiring, exchanging, selling, or managing
public funds, a trustee shall act with care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the
circumstances then prevailing, including, but not limited to, the general economic
conditions and the anticipated needs of the agency, that a prudent person acting in a like
capacity and familiar with those matters would use in the conduct of funds of a like
character and with like aims, to safeguard the principal and maintain the liquidity needs of
the agency. Within the limitations of this section and considering individual investments
as part of an overall strategy, investments may be acquired as authorized by law."
RTD shall recognize that no investment is totally riskless and that the investment activities of
RTD are a matter of public record. Accordingly, it recognizes that occasional measured losses are
inevitable in a diversified portfolio and shall be considered within the context of the overall
Portfolio’s return, provided that adequate diversification has been implemented, and that the sale
of a security is in the best long-term interest of RTD.

4.2 Delegation of Authority
RTD is granted legislative authority to invest its funds pursuant to Colorado Revised Statutes,
Section 32-9-119. Management responsibility for the investment program is hereby delegated to
the General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) and her designees. The GM/CEO’s designee will
hereinafter be referred to as the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”).
RTD may, in its discretion, contract with one or more investment advisers, registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, to manage a
portion of its Portfolio assets. Any such advisor shall comply with this Policy and such other
written instructions as provided by RTD.
While it is understood that the procedures and trading counterparties of a contracted investment
adviser may differ from those of RTD, contracted investment advisers must maintain internal
controls and compliance systems at least as extensive as those of the RTD in order to assure
adequate protection of RTD assets in keeping with the standards of prudence outlined below.
4.3 Investment Procedures
The CFO shall establish written procedures for the operation of the investment program,
consistent with this Policy, which shall include explicit delegation of authority to persons
responsible for investment transactions. No person may engage in an investment transaction
except as provided under the terms of this Policy and the internal procedures established by the
CFO. Persons who are authorized to transact investment business and wire funds on behalf of
RTD are listed in Appendix 1 to this policy.
4.4 Internal Controls
The CFO shall establish a system of internal controls, which shall be reviewed annually. The
controls shall be designed to prevent loss of funds due to fraud, employee error, misrepresentation
by third parties, or imprudent actions by employees of RTD.
4.5 Ethics and Conflicts of Interest
Investment activities shall be performed in accordance with RTD’s Code of Ethics and other
policies of RTD. Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from
personal business activity that could conflict with the proper execution of the investment

Authorized investment personnel acting in accordance with this Policy and exercising due
diligence shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security’s credit risk or market
price changes, provided that deviations from expectation are reported in a timely fashion and
appropriate action is taken to control adverse developments.

5. AUTHORIZED INVESTMENTS
Authorized investments for RTD funds are specifically listed below. RTD recognizes that
investment risk can result from issuer defaults, market price changes or various technical
impediments leading to diminished liquidity or loss of capital. Portfolio risk management and
diversification are employed as a way to minimize the risks inherent in investing.
Credit Criteria: Credit criteria listed in this section refer to the credit rating at the time the security
is purchased. Rating categories defined by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations
(“NRSROs”) include intermediate rating categories. For example, the second highest rating
category (“AA”) includes bonds rated AA+, AA and AA- for Standard & Poor's and Fitch, and
Aa1, Aa2 and Aa3 for Moody's Investors Service. In the event that an issuer or security is
downgraded below the minimum rating level for any specific security that is held in the Portfolio,
the CFO will review the exposure of that security holding and will determine if it is advisable to
sell such holding.
Maturity Restrictions: Maturity restrictions shall be calculated from settlement date to maturity
date. Portfolio percentage restrictions by security type and issuer are applicable only on the date
of purchase of the investment.
Sector Diversification: The Portfolio will be limited to an aggregate exposure of 50% for the
following investment types: Municipal Bonds, Corporate Bonds, Commercial Paper, Time
Deposits/Time Certificates of Deposit and Banker's Acceptances.
1. U.S. Treasury Obligations. Obligations in the form of bills, notes, bonds or certificates of
indebtedness backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America. 100%
of the Portfolio may be invested in U.S. Treasury Obligations. The maximum maturity for
investments in U.S. Treasury Obligations shall be limited to five years.
2. Federal Agency and Instrumentality Securities: Obligations, participations or other
instruments of any Federal agency, instrumentality or United States government-sponsored
enterprise as described in CRS 24-75-601.1(1)(b) (an “Agency” or “Agencies”). Such
securities shall be rated in one of the two highest rating categories (as described above in
the Credit Criteria section) by at least two NRSROs. No more than 75% of the Portfolio
may be invested in Federal Agency and Instrumentality Securities, with no more than 25%

and investment officials shall disclose to the GM/CEO any material financial interests in financial
institutions that conduct business with RTD, and they shall further disclose any large

7.1 Safekeeping and custody
With the exception of collateral under repurchase agreements (discussed below), all investment
securities purchased shall be held in a safekeeping account or trust custody account at a
designated third party custodian. For safekeeping accounts, the institution shall issue a
safekeeping receipt for each security, listing the specific instrument, par value, rate, CUSIP and
any other pertinent information. In addition, the safekeeping or trust custody institutions shall
provide a statement on at least a monthly basis listing all securities held in account, including
book value and market value of holdings at month-end.
For collateral (purchased securities) under repurchase agreements, RTD may utilize tri-party
repurchase agreements with an acceptable third-party custodian provided that RTD is satisfied
that it has perfected interest in the securities used as collateral, and that RTD has a properly
executed tri-party agreement.

7.2 Delivery vs. Payment
All investment transactions will be executed on a delivery versus payment basis.

Investment reports shall be prepared on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis. Transaction
summaries shall be maintained and available in the office of the CFO or other authorized
investment personnel. Quarterly investment reports shall be submitted to the Board of Directors
and shall outline RTD’s total investment return and compare the Portfolio’s performance to a
publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics.
Staff will include an annual listing of investments held and investment returns within the Annual
Comprehensive Financial Report.
All securities holdings reports for RTD shall disclose the average maturity of the investment
portfolio.
9. PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
RTD's Portfolio is managed with the objective of obtaining a market rate of return, commensurate
with identified risk constraints and cash flow characteristics. Because the composition of the
Portfolio fluctuates, depending on market and credit conditions, various indices may be used to
monitor investment performance.
The current board-approved index for the liquidity tier of the Portfolio (cash and cash equivalents)
is the ICE BofAML 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index. For the enhanced cash portion of the Portfolio
(securities maturing between 90 days and 5 years and with a target duration of 1 year), the
designated performance benchmark is the ICE BofAML 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.
RTD recognizes that bond proceeds must be invested in accordance with Section 1.148 of the
U.S. Internal Revenue Code, related to arbitrage rebate, which limits the investment returns which
may be achieved or retained by RTD on such proceeds investments. For purposes of this Policy
“bond proceeds” shall mean proceeds from the issuance of bonds, certificates of participation or
other financial securities issued by RTD.
10. INVESTMENT POLICY REVIEW AND APPROVAL
The CFO shall conduct a review of the Policy on an annual basis and present the Policy, denoting
any changes, to the Board of Directors for approval.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
2024 Fiscal Policy

October 3, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
October 24, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the 2024 Fiscal Policy.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
Each year staff presents for the Board’s consideration the proposed Fiscal Policy for the upcoming fiscal
year. The Fiscal Policy may be amended by the Board at any time.
The most recent modification to the Fiscal Policy was approved by the Board of Directors in October
2022 for the 2023 fiscal year.
DISCUSSION
Modifications to the Fiscal Policy for 2024 include the following:
•
•
•

•
•
•

Minor grammatical changes
Relocation of an existing reference to preparation of a Mid-term Financial Plan in the Capital
Improvement Policies section to the Budget Policies section
Clarification in the Fund Balance Policies section to allow for additional debt to fund the Transit
Asset Management (TAM) Plan in which:
o Doing so would be financially advantageous for cash flow purposes, or
o The investment returns on available funds exceeds the cost of debt
Relocation of the reference to maintaining a minimum net revenue coverage ratio from the Debt
Policies section to the Budget Policies section
Modification of the amended budget phrasing in the Budget Policies section in alignment with
RTD’s intent to no longer plan to complete an amended budget annually unless necessary
A change in terminology from a reference to the annual preparation of a six-year Mid-term
Financial Plan to that of a Five-year Financial Forecast. This change is being made to be more
descriptive of the financial planning process and changing from six-years to five years due to a
five-year forecast being in alignment with common industry practices. The financial forecast
terminology will be changed to the Five-year Financial Forecast from the Mid-term Financial Plan

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
2024-2029 Mid-term Financial Plan (MTFP)

October 3, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
October 24, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt the 2024-2029 Mid-term Financial Plan (MTFP).
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
Todd Nikkel, Senior Manager, Budget
BACKGROUND
The 2024-2029 MTFP is the six-year financial forecast used as the basis for the development of the
2024 Budget and provides guidance for future year financial planning. The development of this forecast
seeks to balance planned expenditures with anticipated available funding sources in alignment with
RTD’s Strategic Plan. Adoption of the 2024-2029 MTFP by the Board is not a commitment or
appropriation of funding.
DISCUSSION
The 2024-2029 MTFP projects that the agency’s forecasted revenues and reserves are sufficient to
meet expected operational, debt service and asset management expenditures while maintaining reserves
as required by the Board approved RTD Fiscal Policy. While RTD’s financial position is forecasted to
meet the Strategic Priority of Financial Success through 2029, vigilance will be required to ensure the
agency maintains activities within the projected fiscal constraints. The 2024-2029 MTFP was developed
in consideration of a prudent, fiscally sustainable approach including provisions such as restrained sales
and use tax growth projections resulting from Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TABOR) implications. The result of
this forecast is a presentation of a fiscally conservative plan that allows for agility and scalability over
the six-year period.
Beginning in FY 2024, RTD will pivot to a five-year mid-term planning cycle in alignment with common
public and private industry practices, leveraging a document that will be known as the Five-year
Financial Forecast.
2024-2029 MTFP Assumptions
• Fare revenue is based on current trends in ridership as well as the Systemwide Fare Study and
Equity Analysis provisions. Ridership is forecast to increase 9.7% in 2024 due to lower fares and
increase 2.0% annually thereafter. A modest fare increase is assumed in 2027 subject to
additional future discussions.
• Sales and use tax projections provided in August 2023 by the University of Colorado Leeds
School of Business project a $19.4 million decrease over the March 2023 forecast. The decrease

Packet Pg. 72

16.D

•
•
•

is primarily due to weaker collections during 2023. Additionally, staff further reduced the
forecasted decrease for the Base System growth by capping annually at 1.4% after 2024 for
TABOR limits resulting in an overall decrease to forecasted sales and use tax revenues of $31.7
million. The 1.4% Base System growth assumption matches the assumptions from Reimagine
RTD in which growth was capped at the growth rate of property taxes in alignment with TABOR
revenue growth limits.
Operating expenses increase at an annual rate of 5.1% over the six-year MTFP period due to
inflationary assumptions. Limited increases to headcount are assumed.
Asset management expenditures are included that maintain assets in a state of good repair based
on current information.
Reserves are projected to increase $202 million during the six-year MTFP to ensure that operating
reserves of three months expenses and a capital replacement fund are maintained as required by
fiscal policies.

Current Outlook
• The 2024-2029 period balances funding sources and uses while maintaining reserves
• Service levels reflect the System Optimization Plan requirements
• Funding of full asset management backlog plus reserves for future needs
• Debt service coverage ratio policy of 1.2x is met each year
• Reserves of three months operating expenses met in each year

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
GM/CEO Compensation Base Salary Range

October 16, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
October 24, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) Base Salary
Compensation Range
REPRESENTATIVE
Erik Davidson, Performance Committee Chair
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 minutes
BACKGROUND
On September 20, 2020, RTD and General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) Debra A. Johnson entered into
a five-year employment agreement (Agreement). The Agreement sets forth her compensation and
benefits, as well as a program by which the Board, in consultation with Ms. Johnson, establishes
performance goals and metrics, annually evaluates her performance, and utilizes a framework for
determining future incentive awards and increases to base salary subject to her meeting or exceeding
these goals. The Agreement has been amended by the parties four times, with the most recent
amendment adopted by the Board on October 25, 2022. The Third Amendment to the Agreement
provides that RTD will engage a third party by competitive solicitation to conduct a compensation and
benchmarking analysis that will be used by the Board in consultation with GM/CEO Johnson to
determine her compensation for performance periods beginning January 1, 2023.
Following a competitive solicitation, Gallagher Benefit Services, Inc. (Gallagher) was selected to conduct
a comprehensive and systematic benchmarking analysis of the total compensation package for the
GM/CEO, including both external market-based factors and internal equity considerations, to ensure
competitiveness in pay practices. This analysis intended to inform the Board in its decisions on
compensation for the GM/CEO position relative to market considerations. The results of the study were
presented to the Performance Committee on November 16, 2022.
On September 26, 2023, the Board approved its Compensation Philosophy for the GM/CEO, which
outlines principles to guide the components of the GM/CEO’s total compensation, including the
following:
•

Demonstrate internal equity, fairness, and transparency while being externally market
competitive, aligned to the 50th percentile of comparable public transit agencies and related
public and private sectors where executive talent may reside

Packet Pg. 85

16.E

•

Be reviewed for market competitiveness and legislative/regulatory compliance (local, state, and
federal) on an annual basis

During the October 2, 2023, Performance Committee (Committee) meeting, Committee members having
reviewed the Gallagher study considered the recommended GM/CEO Base Salary Range based on the full
market data of comparable organizations as follows:
The Committee noted that the data used to establish the recommended base salary range was nearly 12
months old. Consequently, to remain competitive with the market, an aging factor was recommended to
account for market changes that may have occurred since the November 2022 report resulting in a
recommended adjusted GM/CEO Base Salary Range of:
•

Minimum: $292,600 Midpoint: $402,325 Maximum: $512,050

The Employment Cost Index (ECI) measures changes in the cost of employees to employers over time. In
the private sector, business owners and human resources professionals can use the ECI to make
decisions about pay adjustments to help them stay competitive. In the public sector, the Federal Reserve
and others use the ECI to gauge the health of the labor market, adjust contracts, and research the labor
market. (Source: US Bureau of Labor Statistics)
DISCUSSION
In adopting this recommended action, the Board honors the intent of the Compensation Philosophy for
the GM/CEO and establishes a market competitive base salary range designed to attract and retain a
GM/CEO with the required suite of competencies, knowledge, and experience to lead and inspire an
innovative, complex, and unique multi-modal transit agency.
Further, in adopting this recommended action, the Board will honor its commitment to establishing a
base compensation range for the GM/CEO position, consistent with the 2010 State Audit on Executive
Compensation Practice and will bring the agency into alignment with its wage transparency obligations
under the Colorado Equal Pay for Equal Work Act.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Establishing a base salary range for the GM/CEO position does not automatically equate to a change in
the current GM/CEO's base compensation, as that is governed by the existing term contract.

STUDY BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
Purpose of Study and Study Scope
In the spring of 2022, RTD issued a request for proposal to conduct a compensation study for
RTD covering the transportation industry GM/CEO positions. This study includes collecting
market data using a custom survey and published survey sources to analyze and evaluate all
data in an objective manner and make recommendations designed to assist RTD in attracting,
recruiting, and retaining top performing talent. Specifically, the identified project objectives were:




Identify and document the basis for selection of minimum of ten comparable agencies for
external benchmarking to include a comparison to equivalent positions with similar function,
scope, and a comparison to agencies with the transit industry, comparable governmental
entities, and comparable geographic markets.
Conduct independent external total compensation survey (base salary, incentive pay, paid
leave, benefits, and pension), compile data, and perform external benchmarking analysis.



Collect market salary data utilizing custom and published survey sources (where applicable);



Analyze market base compensation (actual pay and pay ranges) for benchmark jobs to
evaluate market competitiveness;



Conduct internal equity assessment of GM/CEO total compensation as compared to non –
represented RTD employees;



Recommend a base salary range and market midpoint for the GM/CEO position.



Present findings reflecting total compensation market research, benchmarking and internal
equity analysis and recommendations to RTD Board Performance and full Board of
Directors.

In spring 2022, Gallagher submitted a proposal to RTD to perform the work requested and the
work began in October 2022. Below are the specific phase activities of the project as identified
and submitted in the proposal and agreed upon by Gallagher consultants and RTD.

RTD Compensation System
RTD currently does not have a salary schedule for all the GM/CEO position. RTD has
recognized that as time has progressed and changes in the economy and labor market have
taken place, the need for a GM/CEO salary schedule has become apparent; one that will help
RTD to be more attractive to prospective and current employees.

STUDY PROCESS
In October 2022, Gallagher consultants met with RTD’ Project manager. The purpose of the
meeting was to:



Review the presentation and to discuss coordination for the upcoming employee information
sessions;
Discuss market comparators for the custom survey;



Confirm subordinate positions for equity pay;



Confirm the project timeline;



Discuss RTD Denver’s current GM/CEO total compensation;



Discuss expectations for final report and presentation.

At the end of the meeting, Gallagher consultants and RTD project manager were clear on the
timeline, information needed from RTD to conduct the study, deliverables and how to approach
the upcoming project phases.
.
In early October 2022, RTD provided a list of 20 comparator organizations being used in connection to
parallel compensation study for non-represented employees. Gallagher consultants reviewed the list
and confirmed that these were comparable agencies. The comparators selected, were identified and
chosen based on a variety of factors to include:

In mid-October, the data collection form (survey) containing the GM/CEO benchmark job was
sent to RTD for its review, consideration, and approval. On October 18, 2022, RTD approved
the data collection form (survey) to be sent to the comparator organizations. The survey was
then sent to the comparator organizations with a requested submission date of November 31,
2022. During the survey completion timeframe, Gallagher and RTD made several follow-up
emails and phone calls to the comparator organizations to solicit participation and to answer any
questions the comparator organizations had about the survey or study.

While the comparator organizations were completing the survey, Gallagher consultants
collected published survey job matches, which includes public sector and private sector data
cuts where possible for cross-industry jobs). The combination of the custom survey and
published market data is reflected in the findings and recommendations detailed at the end of
this report.
Throughout the study, Gallagher consultants met regularly with RTD Project Team to discuss
milestones, needs, deliverables, and any concerns.

STUDY FINDINGS
In October 2022, with the responses to the custom survey received, market data collected from
published survey sources, and to provide RTD with preliminary cost for upcoming budget
deliberations, Gallagher consultants met with RTD’ Project manager to review the preliminary
compensation analysis and results.
Salary Comparisons
Custom and Published Survey Data Collection and Analysis
Of the twenty comparator organizations identified and surveyed, Gallagher summarized
responses from 13 out of 20 (65%) organizations invited to participate in the survey. The custom
survey was supplemented with published survey data representative of the public and private
sector.
Gallagher reviewed and analyzed the obtained published and custom survey data using
statistical tools and sought clarification with the participating organizations to validate matches
for those jobs where the data seemed to be an outlier. Gallagher follows the U.S Department of
Justice and Federal Trade Commission guidelines, which states five job matches should exist
per job to conduct statistical analyses or draw conclusions.

Geographic Adjustments and Aging Market Salary Data
Two important adjustments made to the data was to account for the differences in the cost of
labor for the Denver, Colorado as compared to other areas within the United States as well as
aging of the published survey data forward to account for pay changes that may have occurred
during the study timeframe. Aging factors were not applied to the custom survey market salary
data. It represents current effective salaries at participant organizations.
The cost of labor refers to the difference in pay or labor market for a job from one location to
another. The cost of labor is what a particular geographic market offers as the “going rate” or
compensation for its jobs and reflects the local demand for and supply of labor. Thus, if market
data were collected from a particular geographic location, they were adjusted downward/upward
based on Colorado’s cost of labor differential.

Market Comparison Results
Once all data were collected, reviewed, and analyzed for alignment with RTD’ benchmark jobs,
Gallagher compared RTD’ actual salaries for GM/CEO position with the market data collected. The
difference from the market for each benchmark is calculated as follows:


RTD data minus Market data divided by the market data:
– A positive figure indicates that RTD pay above the market.
– A negative figure indicates that RTD pay below the market.

The following guidelines were used when determining the competitive nature of RTD’ current
compensation:

Following the standard compensation guidelines outlined above, RTD GM/CEO salary is
competitive with the 50th percentile full market at -3%.
More specifically, further analysis of the full market (custom and published survey public and

A variance greater than +/- 15% difference with the market is significantly misaligned. Such
variance does not necessarily mean misalignment. Factors such as performance, turnover
and longevity impact actual salaries and may explain some of the differences between RTD
and the market actual salaries for individual jobs

Proposed Salary Range Adjustments
To analyze the competitiveness of the pay and propose a pay range for the RTD GM/CEO job,
Gallagher reviewed the market to identify potential impact of job placement and implementation
costs:


We proposed a salary schedule by comparing the market 50th percentile of actual pay to
create a pay grade midpoint and structure.



This is based on the general assumption that most organizations typically build
competitive salary structure ranges for hiring and retention by anchoring the structure at
the market 50th percentile (or median) of actual salaries or based on compensation
philosophy to support recruitment and retention.

To keep up with competitive market hiring and retention, we recommend RTD review the
proposed pay grade (closest pay grade aligned to the full market 50th actual salary)
based on internal factors such as comparable positions in the current pay grade, career levels,
supervisor-subordinate relationships.
Implementation Options
It is important for RTD to implement the proposed GM/CEO salary range adjustments through a
consistent pay implementation process to reduce potential salary compression issues and
impact of inflation.
Cost implementation analysis (provided there is a change) includes employee pay adjustments
within the current or recommended range based on GM/CEO current pay rate and years of
service in position

Identifying Pay Compression

Goal

Internal pay equity assessment of GM/CEO’s total compensation as compared
to non-represented RTD employees.

Methodology

Best practice of 20% differential between the supervisor's pay and the
subordinate's pay.

Findings

The total compensation of the GM/CEO is equitable compared to nonrepresented RTD employees.

Internal Pay Equity Assessment
•
•

•
•
•

•

Gallagher determined that the total compensation of the GM/CEO is equitable.
Gallagher determined that the base salary of the GM/CEO is 37% higher than
the highest paid subordinate employee.
• Formula used: Supervisor pay - Subordinates pay ÷ Subordinates pay
Additional compensation and perquisites provided to the GM/CEO include deferred
comp and incentive awards.
These are all considered reasonable and consistent with that provided by peer
organizations.
RTD does not appear to provide vehicle allowance, club membership,
supplemental retirement, executive long-term disability (LTD) supplemental life
insurance, employer paid retiree health insurance, and/or disability insurance to
the GM/CEO, which are common elements of the total compensation package
provided to comparator industry GM/CEOs.
Determine if subordinates are paid equitably compared to their supervisor.

This range spread would encompass the full

market.

The compensation paid to the General Manager/ Chief Executive Officer (GM/CEO) has been
compared against the compensation data from comparable organizations in this report. Our findings
indicate that the total compensation paid to the GM/CEO is competitive with the market when
compared with comparable organizations. This level of compensation should be considered
reasonable with potential opportunities to increase overall compensation with market trends.
Should the GM/CEO pay increase to the market median, it would still be reasonable.
1. The Custom Survey data showed that the GM/CEO was competitive (+/-10%) with
the market median salary in comparison to the GM/CEO in the
comparator organizations.
2. The Published survey data showed that the GM/CEO was possibly misaligned (+/10-15%) with the market median salary.
3. The Full Market data (Custom and Published) showed that the GM/CEO was
competitive (+/-10%) with the market median salary.

The recommended salary range to RTD’ GM/CEO based on the full market data of comparable

Next Steps and Recommendations
The following next steps are being recommended to RTD upon the conclusion of the
compensation study:


RTD adopts the Gallagher proposed GM/CEO salary range and the supporting strategies
based on the data received and analysis performed;



RTD determines the timeframe and/or phases for implementing the Gallagher proposed
GM/CEO salary range, implementation options and any proposed changes to benefits
(immediate, phase in over 2 year, 3 years, etc.).

Ongoing Administration
Gallagher recommends that pay administration guidelines should be implemented for placing
and moving the GM/CEO employee through the proposed salary range. Based on this, and in
closing, we recommend the following:


Looking ahead, conduct regular reviews of the compensation system and relevant market
data to ensure that a competitiveness with the market is maintained:
o
o
o

The GM/CEO salary range should be adjusted by a structure movement trend factor
every year to remain competitive with the market.
The GM/CEO overall benefits should be analyzed and adjusted by using a market
trend comparison regularly to remain competitive with the market.
Advance GM/CEO incumbent pay through the assigned pay range based on time in
position or longevity to mitigate compression, while also considering overall
performance. This ensures the following:




Actual pay for new hire GM/CEO subordinates are differentiated by minimum
20% lower than GM/CEO pay.
The more tenured GM/CEO becomes, the closer their pay rate is aligned to
market target rate.
Refine the RTD Compensation Philosophy and its gradual and/or immediate
implementation.

CONCLUSION & GOING FORWARD
The report presents independent data to guide and inform future compensation decisions as per
the “safe harbor” provision of the intermediate Sanctions law. As part of this study, it is the intent
to provide the board with information intended to assist them in determining if total
compensation paid to the GM/CEO is more than “reasonable compensation” in accordance with
Section 4958 (intermediate Sanctions) of the internal Revenue Code. This is a
standard/regulation by which our practice follows in considering executive compensation for
public sector and higher education clients.
The current pay for the GM/CEO is reasonable. RTD compensation level for the GM/CEO is
competitive compared to similar executive jobs in the market. This level of compensation should
also be considered reasonable with potential opportunities to increase overall compensation
with market trends.
Compensation is often seen as a major reason executive like the RTD GM/CEO go to work for
an organization and remain employed by them. Through the study, RTD can design a long-term
compensation strategy that will enable the organization to move forward, attract and retain their
leadership well into the future.
Gallagher is prepared to support RTD in its compensation efforts by responding to requests for
advice, support, and services from RTD’ management staff. We are available via email,
telephone and can be on-site.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
2024 Legislative and Government Relations Program

October 19, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
October 24, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt the 2024 Legislative and Government Relations Program.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Davies, Government Relations Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
As part of the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan, staff initiated a process to develop and implement an annual
Legislative Program. The Board of Directors approved the agency’s first Legislative Program in October
2021. The Legislative Program is adopted by the Board annually and serves as a guiding document for
Government Relations staff, and external advocates, to pursue goals related to legislation and policy
matters. Additionally, the Legislative Program serves as an organizing document that can be adjusted
throughout a legislative session to provide an avenue for Board adopted policy positions to be
communicated and pursued by agency staff.

DISCUSSION
In line with the agency’s mission and vision established in the Strategic Plan, the development and
inclusion of the goals and actions contained in the Legislative and Government Relations Program are
designed to make lives better through connections. It is important that RTD serve as a trusted partner to
the region’s local, state, and federal elected officials. To achieve the adopted goals, RTD must be
proactive in education and inform the District’s elected officials of the challenges and opportunities
available to advance shared goals. Equally important is building trust through partnership that fits within
the framework of RTD’s financial forecast. The proposed 2024 Legislative and Government Relations
Program, included as Attachment A to this Board report, outlines priority actions on a variety of issues
that staff believe are achievable through advocacy and collaboration.
If approved, the 2024 Legislative Program will be implemented and effective beginning Monday, January
1, 2024.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
While RTD may be financially impacted by certain legislation, Board approval of this document has no
immediate agency financial impact.

2024 Legislative and Government Relations Program
PURPOSE
To establish a set of Board-approved legislative and advocacy policies that benefit the Regional
Transportation District (RTD) and assist in guiding staff’s actions and efforts during the 2024 legislative
session that support the priorities and success outcomes of the agency’s adopted 2021-2026 Strategic
Plan.
STRATEGY
Developing and maintaining relationships with myriad stakeholders is central to RTD’s strategic
approach to government relations. Staff will work to communicate, educate, inform and partner with
the agency’s Congressional delegation, the Governor’s Office, the state General Assembly delegation,
and local elected officials to advocate for Board approved policies.
Additionally, staff will continue to work with its industry associations – such as the America Public
Transportation Association (APTA), the Colorado Association of Transit Agencies (CASTA), regional
transportation management organizations/associations (TMOs/TMAs), Chambers of Commerce, and
other stakeholder organizations – to partner and collaborate on shared goals to advance and seek
support for legislative positions approved by the Board. Lastly, tactics included in the Legislative
Program will be guided and informed by the priorities set forth in the agency’s Board-approved 20212026 Strategic Plan – Community Value, Customer Excellence, Employee Ownership, Financial Success.
EXECUTION PLAN
Contained herein are specific priorities and actions that outline areas of focus for the 2024 Legislative
and Government Relations Program. Beyond the actions listed in this program, specific legislative
matters are likely to arise that warrant consideration by the Board of Directors.
To allow staff flexibility for consideration of items to be changed, added, or deleted as a result of
legislation introduced during the legislative session, the recommended change must be presented to the
Board as part of the Board Executive Committee or another Committee deemed appropriate by the
General Manager/CEO and Board Chair. If time does not allow for an item to be agendized for a
Committee meeting for discussion by the Board, RTD will remain neutral on the legislation in question.

October: Full board considers for approval

Categories of proposed changes: Generally, the proposed changes to the policy fall into the following
categories: revisions to align the board’s travel policies with that of the agency; additions to drive financial
transparency; edits to clarify language; adaptations of policies to align with current practices and a
modernization of business expenses; changes to use more inclusive language; and modifications to drive
clarity as well as reduce redundancy.
Key proposed changes: Key changes to the policy include
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Replacing per meal and incidental expense reimbursement with a per diem system for out-ofdistrict travel. (Aligns with RTD employee travel policy change)
Addition of a fourth expense category for out-of-district conference registrations to drive financial
transparency.
Modernization of business expenses to include changes in air fare and hotel pricing
Renaming the policy to be the RTD Board of Directors Expense and Reimbursement Policy
Explicitly creating the option for Directors to receive an RTD issued cell phone
More clearly identifying acceptable expenses
Adding deadlines and providing a timeline for expense reimbursement requests, which align with
IRS policies on expense reimbursements

Next steps: Should the board adopt these changes the new policy would take effect starting January 1,
2024. And while the board would retain the ability to update the policy further at any time, the policy
would then be placed on a review cycle to be revisited in the fall of 2026.

Introduction
The Regional Transportation District Act, specifically in sections 32-9-114 (d) and
32-9-117, establishes the authority for reimbursement of necessary expenses
pertaining to the activities of the District. The following policy is intended to give
guidance and set limits on expenses and allowable reimbursements for members of
the RTD Board of Directors. The Board has directed the agency to provide these funds
to Directors only for conducting official RTD business.
1.0.

General Policy

Directors are eligible for reimbursement from the District for reasonable expenses
incurred that are necessary to the transaction of official District business. Each
Director must exercise sound judgment when incurring and submitting for
reimbursement such expenses, in keeping within the standards and proprieties of an
agency supported by public tax dollars. These funds are not intended to be used in a
discretionary way for special projects or initiatives undertaken by individual Directors.
Each Director’s annual limit for allowable expenses and reimbursements is as follows:
Travel Expense and Local Expense
Conferences

$6000

$4000
*The Chair may
access up to an
additional $1500

IT Expenses for Out of District
Monthly
Conference
Internet/Phone*
Registration
Fees
$1680
$1800.00

*IT expenses eligible for reimbursement are outlined in Section 5.0, Business
Communications.

The expense limits outlined above may not be exceeded but for the following
exceptions:
• Under direction from the Chair, the Board Office may transfer funds between
a Director’s Travel and Local accounts to cover allowable expenses incurred
or anticipated to be incurred by the Director.
• The Chair may utilize funds from the Chair’s account to pay for another
Director’s travel or local expenses.
Directors who do not meet their limit for expense reimbursement may not transfer
unused portions to another Director. Any unused portions will not roll over to the
next fiscal year and Directors are not eligible to be issued an RTD Procurement Card
(P-Card).

The Board of Directors may choose to periodically limit by way of resolution the
amount annually allocated to the Directors’ expense accounts as the economy and
the fiscal sustainability of the District dictate.
The Board of Directors of the Regional Transportation District has taken formal action
to delegate authorization for travel necessary to the transaction of official business,
within budget limitations, as follows:
• The Chair may authorizebusiness, conference, and training travel, including
associated expenses for Directors.
• The allowable reimbursable expenses contained in this document are detailed
in Section 2.0, Reimbursable Expenses.

Commented [TSP2]: Removed/revised for clarity.
Commented [TSP3]: This section was simplified.

The Chair may choose to deny a request from a Director for travel not covered by
this policy, refer the request to the Executive Committee, or both. The Chair may
refer any travel or reimbursement request to the Executive Committee without the
Chair’s prior determination on the request.
A Director whose request for travel has been denied by the Chair or the Executive
Committee may appeal for reconsideration of the denial by the full Board. Unless the
travel request is subsequently approved, the Board Office cannot make further travel
arrangements related to the denied trip. A Director is not eligible for reimbursement
for the cost of any unapproved travel costs or arrangements booked by the Director.
The Chair must deny the travel request of any Director who has expended or will
have expended prior to the trip all funds from the Director’s travel budget, unless the
Chair elects to authorize the Board Office to pay for the Director’s travel expenses
using supplemental funds.
The Board of Directors may not incur expenses to any RTD departmental (except
Board Office) or non-departmental budget code. All incurred travel related-expenses
eligible for reimbursement by a Director must be charged to the Director’s travel
Budget.

18.1.b

Commented [TSP4]: Removed as this is not currently practiced.

For local, transit-related events sponsored by RTD, a Director is eligible for
reimbursement for normal, customary expenses incurred by the Director, and a guest,
The expenses of the Director and the Director’s guest, are paid from the Director’s
local expense fund. (Resolution 002, Series of 2019).
While the Colorado Independent Ethics Commission has ruled that Article XXIX of
the State Constitution (also referred to as Amendment 41) pertaining to ethics in
government does not specifically apply to the RTD Board, the recommendation from
RTD’s General Counsel is for Directors to refrain from accepting anything of greater
than nominal value in the exercise of their official duties. A Director who attends, in
as an exercise of their official duties, an event for which the expected value of
attendance exceeds $75.00 is responsible for the cost of their attendance. Directors
may submit itemized receipts for reimbursement, or the Board Office can make

To protect the interest of the District and to provide guidelines for the Directors to
follow, the following provisions govern allowances for out of town and local businessrelated expenses within established budget limits.

purpose, and the name and title of any qualifying attendee, if applicable. An ordinary
expense is one that is common and accepted in one’s field of trade, business, or
profession. Political meetings, partisan conferences, or political group activities
cannot be covered as an RTD expense.
If meetings between multiple Directors and either employees or business contacts
result in the a subsequent request to reimburse for a meal, the meal costs are equally
divided among the Directors attending and charged to each Director’s local expense
account accordingly. Directors are not eligible for reimbursement for meals or event
fees incurred by guests except as described in Section 1.0, General Policy.
In the event that RTD purchases a table for an event for which not all seats are
claimed by Directors and staff, a Director may request additional seats on a firstcome, first-served basis and may invite a guest at no cost to the Director’s local
expense account.
Any incidental local expenses submitted without a proper itemized receipt will only
be reimbursed up to $10.00.
In-person Board and/or Committee Meetings are typically catered for the convenience
of Directors. If a Director chooses to have a meal ordered for them by the Board
Office, the cost of the meal will be charged back to their local account. If a Director
chooses to purchase their own meal from a different vendor, the Director must
provide an itemized receipt in order to be reimbursed for the meal cost.
Directors are not eligible for reimbursement for expenses, such as meals, flights,
hotels, etc., whether local or out-of-District, for any non-RTD transit-related business.
This includes expenses incurred by spouses, significant others, guests, or
dependents. In the event that a Director departs from an out-of-district event or
conference earlier than anticipated or stays longer than originally scheduled through
the Board Office, the Director cannot be reimbursed for meals or lodging fees for the
full days missed due to early departure or additional days of expenses incurred as a
result of staying longer. For any additional airline fees or charges incurred as the
result of a flight change due to an early departure or late stay, the Director must bear
the cost as a personal expense.

The Chair has flexibility in approving Director expenses. If requested expenses do
not fall within the expense guidelines, the Chair may seek advice and
recommendations from the Executive Committee.
This policy is not designed to provide guidance on every conceivable expense
reimbursement request, as such, Directors are encouraged to seek advanced preapproval for any potential expense which is not explicitly covered elsewhere in this
document.
Commented [TSP13]: Redundant.

3.0.

Travel Request Process

Travel arrangements for the RTD Directors are typically handled by the Board Office,
and a travel authorization must be received before travel. Directors should contact
the office at least 30 days in advance and provide all information needed to complete
the airline and hotel accommodations. If a Director chooses to make their own travel
arrangements, all travel confirmations are to be provided to the Board Office at the
time of booking for the purpose of record keeping and expense tracking.

Commented [TSP14]: Inclusive language.

When requesting travel arrangements, Directors should provide the following
information to the Board Office:
• Conference name
• Requested arrival and departure dates/times
• Preferred airline and frequent flyer number (if applicable)
• Any applicable discounts, credits or travel miles to be utilized
• Special considerations

18.1.b

Unless prior approval is obtained, the Board Office arranges Directors’ travel on the
most economical fare for the required journey and makes every effort to book the
Directors their desired flights and host hotel accommodations. The Board Office
provides electronic travel confirmations to each Director with the flight and hotel
confirmations, transportation information, a copy of the event registration and
agenda, and other pertinent travel materials.

Commented [TSP15]: Removed out of date language/updated.

Travel requests received less than seven business days before the scheduled trip are
processed based on the most current rates and availability.

Commented [TSP16]: Obsolete.

If a Director cancels their scheduled trip, any airline, conference, or hotel cancellation
penalties will be deducted from their travel and/or conference registration fee
account, as applicable.

Air transportation for travel to out-of-District conferences and events is typically
arranged by the RTD Board Office. Travel by indirect routes, or inclusion of side-trips
for personal reasons, must be approved by the Chair. Reimbursement for travel
expenses in a host city is allowed one day before the start of a conference or one
day following scheduled conference events where travel scheduling provisions or
same day flight times are not available or convenient, such as when a Director would
need to fly from Denver to Washington, D.C., on Saturday to arrive in time for a
conference with a start day of Sunday, and no flights are available for the Director
to arrive in time for the Sunday meeting start time.
Directors are responsible for any portion of ticket costs resulting from personal side
trips (including hotel, food, ground transportation, and parking).

Commented [TSP19]: Redundant.

If the RTD air travel is a portion of another planned flight that has been arranged
directly by the Director, a copy of the itinerary and ticket claiming reimbursement
must be provided to the Board Office at the time of booking.

Commented [TSP20]: No longer used.

A Director is responsible for any first-class, business class, and pro-rata boarding
expenses.
If not purchased simultaneously with the airline ticket, a Director will be reimbursed
for costs associated with both a standard seat selection and checked and/or carryon bags.
Directors who wish to track their frequent flyer miles (if applicable) must provide the
Board Office with the frequent flyer number at the time of the booking. The Board
Office requests this information in advance, but it is the sole responsibility of the
Director to ensure his or her account has been credited with the frequent flyer mileage
information.
All air transportation credits paid for by RTD are to be utilized in the booking of future
Director travel only and are not for personal use.
4.1.2. Ground Transportation
Directors are eligible for reimbursement for the actual expense of ground
transportation necessary to conduct official business. As a representative for the
transit agency, Directors are expected to utilize the most efficient, timely, and costeffective ground transportation when traveling locally or out of town, namely public
transit, complimentary shuttlebus service provided by a hotel or conference,
transportation network company such as UBER or LYFT, taxi, or rental car, in this
order of preference. If a Director pays for the transportation of other Directors or
staff, all names are to be documented on the receipt and expense report for
reimbursement.

Car rental expenses are permitted only with prior approval of the RTD Board Chair
and only when another means of transportation is not feasible. Rental car
arrangements should be made by the Board Office staff. Travel between the airport
and the hotel or conference center by rental car or other means are eligible for
reimbursement with receipts provided that the Chair has authorized the rental.
The rental car should be contracted for a size appropriate for the number of
passengers. The Director must include a copy of the rental contract when submitting
the expense report. Reasonable parking fees for rental cars may be claimed for
reimbursement. (Note: Travelers must ensure that adequate insurance coverage is in
place by purchasing optional insurance coverage as part of the rental agreement.
(Cars are to be refueled before returning to the rental agency.)
4.1.4. Personal Vehicles and Travel Outside the District Other Than by
Air
The use of personal vehicles outside of the District is not encouraged. Directors must
have the Chair’s approval prior to using a personal vehicle for official business outside
the boundaries of the District
If approved, the mileage reimbursement for out of district travel cannot exceed a
reasonable flight cost to and from the destination.
Commented [TSP22]: More efficient use of language.

4.1.5. Mileage Reimbursement
The standard vehicle mileage allowance is determined annually by the Internal
Revenue Service.
All mileage incurred, including to and from the airport for local events and/or travel,
by a Director is paid through the appropriate expense cost code to the Director on all
submitted expense forms.
Director’s expense accounts will cover the first 30 miles of mileage reimbursement
per event. Any mileage that exceeds 30 miles will be charged to a Board Office
expense account for mileage differential.
4.2.

Lodging (Hotel Accommodations)

The Board Office typically books lodging accommodations via P-Card for each
Director attending an out-of-District event. In the event these fees are not pre-paid,
the Director must submit a copy of the official hotel bill with the expense report when
claiming reimbursement.
The Board Office makes reasonable arrangements at the single occupancy rate for
hotel accommodations in accordance with acceptable standards for that location.
For APTA conferences, hotel reservations cannot be booked until the attendee is
registered for the conference. Directors should inform the Board Office staff in a

could fill up.
Hotels typically require a personal credit card for the person staying at the hotel for
purpose of incidental expenditures. Arrangements made via RTD P-Card only cover
room, tax, and any other destination/mandatory fees (if applicable). Upon check in,
Directors will need to provide the front desk with their own personal credit cards for
miscellaneous expenses. When checking out, Directors are advised to check that
their personal credit cards were not charged for room and tax.
Note* For Directors using a debit or bank card to cover miscellaneous expenses, the
hotel may place a hold on the card in a set amount for the duration of the stay.
Directors are eligible for reimbursement for the actual cost of lodging, including room
charges, taxes and fees. Directors who are unable or unwilling to stay at the
conference host hotel, should adhere, whenever possible, to recommended GSA
nightly lodging rates.

Commented [TSP27]: Updated to make language more efficient

Per Diem for Meals and Incidental Travel Expenses

Directors traveling out of district on official RTD business will be reimbursed a daily
per diem amount according to the current federal Continental United States (CONUS)
published reimbursement rates to be used for the cost of meals or other incidental
travel expenses including housekeeping , tips, snacks, drinks, etc. There is no need
for a Director to submit receipts for these items in their travel reimbursement request
as they will receive the CONUS per diem rate by travel location for each day of
business travel, therefore, it is within the Director’s discretion to determine the usage
of this amount. This per diem reimbursement amount will be adjusted annually in
accordance with the General Services Administration federal CONUS reimbursement
rate.

Commented [TSP28]: Algins with new RTD Administrative
practice. Will sufficiently streamline travel reimbursement process
for all parties.

Directors cannot be reimbursed for any day(s) that they may choose to go early or
stay late for personal reasons. (See Section 2.0, Reimbursable Expenses.)
Commented [TSP29]: Covered by per diem.

4.4.

In State Travel Out of District

Directors travelling within the state but outside the District to attend seminars,
conferences, or transit-related meetings are eligible for reimbursement for travel
expenses. Covered expenses include registration fees, lodging, standard mileage,
and Per Diem. Directors are not eligible for reimbursement for lodging expenses
without the prior approval of the Chair. For additional information regarding in state
travel see section 4.1.4 Personal Vehicles and Travel outside the District other than
Air. (Approved Travel and Local policy, November 20, 2007)

Business Communications (cell phone, internet)

Directors are eligible for reimbursement for an initial home office setup package from
their local expense account. Eligible equipment includes high-speed internet
equipment such as a cable modem and router, and printer. The Director is responsible
for selection, use, ownership, loss, and replacement of all equipment after initial
reimbursement by the District. Directors may opt to purchase the equipment or utilize
RTD-owned equipment. Equipment purchased by Directors and reimbursed is
considered RTD property.
Each Director, upon their request, will be provided an RTD issued and owned smart
phone and a laptop/tablet. RTD owned equipment is subject to RTD rules for the use
and handling of agency-owned equipment, including but not limited to policies
governing the type of information permitted to be stored or accessed on the computer
or smart phone. All equipment provided or purchased with funds that were later
reimbursed by the District remains the property of the District and must be returned
upon the Director’s departure from office.
In the alternative, Directors may use their existing equipment or may acquire their
own equipment for use in conducting their official duties. To be eligible for
reimbursement for recurring IT expenses, a Director must submit on a monthly basis
a telephone and/or internet bill indicating the amount paid and location of the internet
services being provided. Monthly reimbursement claims that are not accompanied by
supporting documentation are not eligible for reimbursement.
Monthly IT
reimbursements are capped at $140.00 per Director.

own registration fees, the Director is eligible for reimbursement post travel/event and
must submit with the expense report, when claiming reimbursement, a receipt or
proof of registration fee paid.
The Board cannot exceed its budget allocations for conferences, seminars, and other
such events. Out-of-District registration fees for each Director are charged to the
Directors Conference Registration Fee budget. Local registration fees are charged to
the Directors’ local expense account.

Professional Affiliations/Membership Subscriptions

Commented [TSP35]: Talk to Vivian about this project.

The Regional Transportation District encourages development of Directors through
active membership in professional organizations.
Although membership in
professional affiliations can be an indirect benefit to RTD as an organization, the main
benefit is the development of the Director, by allowing the Director to keep abreast
of trends in their transportation or technology, cultivate networks with other
professionals, and develop skills and ideas to become more effective in their policymaking at RTD. Any memberships that are of an extraordinary cost or that require
approval will go before the Executive Committee for approval.
Membership subscriptions in local chambers or approved organizations are processed
through the RTD Public Relations Office. Directors should submit their membership
requests through the Board office who will track and coordinate with the RTD staff
responsible for payment. Organizations must meet the criteria of being transit-related
and/or necessary to the conduct of business and local community involvement.
Membership requests that do not fit this criterion must be approved through the
General Manager’s budget. The Board policy on Organizational Memberships was
passed in August of 2011.
8.0.

Participation in Transit Related Community Events

A Director is eligible for reimbursement for normal, customary expenses associated
with attending an event for the Director and one guest, so long as the event is transit
related. The expenses of the Director and one guest are paid from the Director’s local
expense fund.
Directors may sponsor a transit related community event with advance approval of
the Chair. Any sponsorship costs will be deducted from the Director’s local expense
account.
9.0.

Participation in Community Non-Transit Related Events

Participation in community non-transit related events is supported by RTD with
approval of the benefit to the agency. Such events are essential in getting the
community involved in the mission and vision of RTD. At times the General Manager
or RTD outreach departments purchase a table at a community event and invite
Directors as ambassadors for RTD at no cost to the Director.
Any other approved events are paid for out of the Director’s local expense budget.
Should a Director decide to purchase a table for an event in the Director’s community

At no time can a Director’s expense funds or RTD funds be used for any event or

or expenditure is political in nature, Directors should consult with RTD General
Counsel.

11.0. Expense Reports
11.1. Travel Expense Reports
Pursuant to IRS guidelines, a Director should submit a completed expense report to
the Board Office no later than the end of the month following the Director’s return to
the District. (e.g., If the trip was taken in October, the expense report is due no later
than by November 30th). The Executive Committee reserves the right to suspend the
provision of travel arrangements for any Director who is delinquent in submitting an
expense report. If extra time is needed to complete the expense report or the Director
has a valid reason for the delay, the Chair should be notified to make the decision to
extend this timeline.
The Board Office processes one travel expense report, post travel, for each Director
traveling to an out-of-District conference or event. In order to provide processing time

18.1.c

For any travel in the last three months of service of a Director’s term, the District
cannot reimburse expenses for transit conferences to Directors who have not met
the statutory requirements to be placed on the ballot for re-election or who are term
limited. Special travel requests by these Directors to complete special projects or
those who have been approved to speak on behalf of the agency can be reviewed
for approval by the full Board, within budget limitations.

Commented [TSP4]: Removed as this is not currently practiced.

For local, transit-related events sponsored by RTD, A a Director is eligible for
reimbursement for normal, customary event expenses incurred by the Director, and
a spouse, significant other, or guest, if the event is a local, transit-related event
sponsored by RTD. The expenses of the Director and the Director’s spouse,
significant other, or invited guest, are paid from the Director’s local expense fund.
(Resolution 002, Series of 2019).

Commented [TSP5]: Edited for inclusive language.

While the Colorado Independent Ethics Commission has ruled that Article XXIX of
the State Constitution (also referred to as Amendment 41) pertaining to ethics in
government does not specifically apply to the RTD Board, the recommendation from
RTD’s General Counsel is for Directors to refrain from accepting anything of greater
than nominal value in the exercise of their official duties. A Director who attends, in
as an exercise of their as a function of his or her official duties, an meal or event for
which the expected value of attendance exceeds $50765.00 is responsible for the
cost of the Director’stheir attendance. Directors may submit itemized receipts for
reimbursement, or the Board Office can make arrangements prior to the meal or event
and charge the cost to the Director’s local expenses.

conference with a start day of Sunday, and no flights are available for the Director
to arrive in time for the Sunday meeting start time.
Directors are responsible for any portion of ticket costs resulting from personal side
trips (including hotel, food, ground transportation, and parking). Airfare is calculated

Office staff will follow established guidelines to determine the lowest available flight
cost to and from the destination. If use of a personal vehicle is requested, the
Director is eligible for reimbursement for the cost of mileage up to the maximum
allowable under the Internal Revenue Service guidelines but not to exceed the cost
of air travel to the destination. The cost of the air travel is to be determined by the
Board Office staff prior to the date of travel to determine the amount that may be
reimbursed for mileage. The determination is established by example of other
Director’s airfare for the same trip or by research of the lowest fares. All supporting
documentation must be submitted by the Board Office staff along with the Director’s
expense form.

Commented [TSP23]: More efficient use of language.

3.1.5.4.1.5. Mileage Reimbursement
The standard vehicle mileage allowance is determined annually by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Board Office verifies with the RTD Accounts Payable
Supervisor the most current rates at the start of each calendar year and includes this
amount in each Director’s local and travel expense spreadsheet.

Commented [TSP24]: Redundant.

All local mileage incurred, including to and from the airport for local events and/or
travel, by a Director is paid through the local appropriate expense cost code to the
Director on all submitted travel expense forms. Round-trip travel to the airport locally
is included in this expense if agency-issued transit passes are unable to be used.

Director’s expense accounts will cover the first 30 miles of mileage reimbursement
per event. Any mileage that exceeds 30 miles will be charged to mileage-differential
and charged to a Board Office expense account for mileage differential.
4.2.

Lodging (Hotel Accommodations)

The Board Office typically books lodging accommodations via P-Card for each
Director attending an out-of-District event. In the event these fees are not pre-paid,
the Director must submit a copy of the official hotel bill with the expense report when
claiming reimbursement.
The Board Office makes reasonable arrangements at the single occupancy rate for
hotel accommodations in accordance with acceptable standards for that location.
For APTA conferences, hotel reservations cannot be booked until the attendee is
registered for the conference. Directors should inform the Board Office staff in a
timely manner they wish to attend a conference, otherwise the conference hotel
could fill up.
Hotels typically require a personal credit card for the person staying at the hotel for
purpose of incidental expenditures. Arrangements made via RTD P-Card only cover
room, and tax, and any other destination/mandatory fees (if applicable). Upon check
in, the Directors will need to provide the front desk with their own personal credit
cards for miscellaneous expenses. When checking out, Directors must are advised
to ensure check that their personal credit cards were not charged for room and tax.
Note* For Directors using a debit or bank card to cover miscellaneous expenses, the
hotel may place a hold on the card in a set amount for the duration of the stay.
Directors are eligible for reimbursement for the actual cost of lodging, including room
charges, and taxes and fees. Charges other than room charges or taxes appearing
on the hotel bill may be reimbursable upon submittal of a completed, signed expense
report accompanied by itemized receipts. If Directors who are unable or unwilling to
stay at the conference host hotel, must use sound judgment in the selection of
lodging in keeping with the purpose of the travel so as to minimize the cost to the
District. it is recommended that they should adhere, whenever possible, to
recommended GSA nightlydaily lodging rates. Lodging or hotel accommodations
billed to a P-Card require itemized receipts to match to the actual incurred amount.
When a Director is accompanied by another individual, the District is to be billed only
for the single-occupancy rate for lodging. The Director must pay for the difference
between single- and double-occupancy rate for the room, if applicable.
3.3.4.3.
Meals Per Diem for Meals and Incidental Travel Expenses
Directors traveling out of district on official RTD business will be reimbursed a daily
per diem amount according to the current federal Continental United States (CONUS)
published reimbursement rates to be used for the cost of meals or other incidental
travel expenses including housekeeping or baggage fees and, tips, snacks, drinks,

etc. There is no need for a Director to submit receipts for these items in their travel
reimbursement request as they will receive the CONUS per diem rate by travel
location for each day of business travel, therefore, it is within the Director’s discretion
to determine the usage of this amount. This per diem reimbursement amount will be
adjusted annually in accordance with the General Services Administration federal
CONUS reimbursement rate.
Directors are eligible for reimbursement for daily personal meals and gratuities with
the submittal of an itemized receipt and documentation that identifies the time, place,
and business purpose.

Commented [TSP29]: Algins with new RTD Administrative
practice. Will sufficiently streamline travel reimbursement process
for all parties.

Directors may claim reimbursement for travel expenses, including meals and
gratuities, incurred one day before the start of a conference or one day following a
conference where travel scheduling provisions or same-day flight times are not
available or convenient, such as when a Director would need to fly from Denver to
Washington, D.C., on Saturday to arrive in time for a conference with a start day of
Sunday, and no flights are available for the Director to arrive in time for the Sunday
meeting start. Directors cannot be reimbursed for any day(s) that they may choose
to go early or stay late for personal reasons. (See Section 2.0, Reimbursable
Expenses.) Directors must provide itemized receipts for incurred travel-related
expenses.
When attending an out-of-District event or conference for which meals are provided,
Directors are expected to reduce the number of meals for which they intend to be
reimbursed by the number of meals that are provided at the event or conference.
However, a Director is eligible for reimbursement for a meal purchased outside of the
conference if the Director submits an itemized receipt explaining the business purpose
for the meal.
3.4. Miscellaneous Expenses
Miscellaneous expenses such as meal gratuities are to be included with each meal
and indicated on the receipt submitted with the expense report. Reasonable gratuities
for baggage handling at airports or the place of lodging upon arrival and departure
are allowable and must be shown as a separate item under “miscellaneous expense”
on the expense report. Baggage fees paid to airlines for travel must be accompanied
with a receipt. Gratuity for housekeeping during lodging is an allowable expense.
Directors are not eligible for reimbursement for personal calls. Calls for District
business are fully reimbursable as long as documentation related to the person called
and the subject of the call is included with the expense report. A Director who claims
reimbursement for monthly cell phone service may not claim a business call as a
separate, additional expense if the call is also included in the monthly service.
Directors traveling out of the country should coordinate with the Board Office to
determine the most cost-effective means of carrying out RTD-related communications
during the time the Director is traveling.

Business Communications (cell phone, internet)

Within the first three months after being elected/appointed and subsequently sworn
in, Directors are eligible for reimbursement for an initial home office setup package
from their local expense account. Eligible equipment includes a smart phone, highspeed internet equipment such as a cable modem and router, fax machine, and
printer. The Director is responsible for selection, use, ownership, loss, and
replacement of all equipment after initial reimbursement by the District. Directors
may opt to purchase the equipment or utilize RTD-owned equipment. Equipment
purchased by Directors and reimbursed as part of the initial $700 set up fee is
considered RTD property.
Each Director, upon their request, will be provided an RTD issued and owned smart
phone and a laptop/tablet. RTD owned equipment is subject to RTD rules for the use
and handling of agency-owned equipment, including but not limited to policies
governing the type of information permitted to be stored or accessed on the computer
or smart phone. All equipment provided or purchased with funds that were later
reminbursedreimbursed by the District remains the property of the District and must
be returned upon the Director’s departure from office. The total package selected
is subject to the $700 initial setup limit.
(Added per the changes in travel and local policy approved November 20, 2007)
In the alternative, Directors may use their existing equipment or may acquire their
own equipment for use in conducting their official duties. To be eligible for
reimbursement for recurring IT expenses, a Director must submit on a monthly basis
documentary evidence such as a telephone and/or internet bill indicating the time,
place, amount paid and location of the internet services being provided. , and
business purpose, which is sufficient to meet the IRS requirement for time, place and
business purpose for equipment purchase or usage. The first land-line telephone into
a home is considered personal and cannot be reimbursed as a business expense.
Monthly reimbursement claims that are not accompanied by supporting
documentation are not eligible for reimbursement. Monthly IT reimbursements are
capped at $140.00 per Director.

Directors should identify, on an annual basis, publications to which they subscribe
and submit their subscription costs on their monthly local expense report.

Out of State District Conference Registrations

Registration fees for conferences, workshops, or other approved events are typically
pre-paid directly by the Board Office. In circumstances where a Director pays for his
or her their own registration fees, the Director is eligible for reimbursement post
travel/event and must submit with the expense report, when claiming reimbursement,
a receipt or proof of registration fee paid and a copy of the program setting forth any
fees for registration.
The Board cannot exceed its budget allocations for conferences, seminars, and other
such events. Out-of-District registration fees for the first two sanctioned events for
each Director are not charged against the Director’s expenses,to the Directors
Conference Registration Fee budget subject to the limitations indicated below. Local
registration fees are charged to the Directors’ local expenses account. The Chair
monitors the Board expenditures on a quarterly basis.

Local In District Conferences/Seminars

Directors are eligible for reimbursement for expenditures or fees incurred while
attending local in district seminars, technical meetings, or meetings related to
professional development upon submittal of a local expense report along with
appropriate receipts. Such fees are charged to the Director’s local expense budget
account.
5.2.

conferences each year. Budget permitting, the Chair may choose to permit individual
Directors to attend additional transit industry-related conferences. The Board Office
is responsible for registering attending Directors, and the office pays the registration
fees for the first two sanctioned conferences using the office’s general budget rather
than the Directors’ individual travel expense budgets.

Professional Affiliations/Membership Subscriptions

Commented [TSP36]: Talk to Vivian about this project.

The Regional Transportation District encourages development of Directors through
active membership in professional organizations.
Although membership in
professional affiliations can be an indirect benefit to RTD as an organization, the main
benefit is the development of the Director, by allowing the Director to keep abreast
of trends in their transportation or technology, cultivate networks with other
professionals, and develop skills and ideas to become more effective in their policymaking at RTD. Any memberships that are of an extraordinary cost or that require
approval will go before the Executive Committee for approval.
Membership subscriptions in local chambers or approved organizations are processed
through the RTD Public Relations Office. Directors should submit their membership
requests through the Board office who will track and coordinate with the RTD staff
responsible for payment. Organizations must meet the criteria of being transit-related
and/or necessary to the conduct of business and local community involvement.
Membership requests that do not fit this criterion must be approved through the
General Manager’s budget. The Board policy on Organizational Memberships was
passed in August of 2011.
For budgeted events only, such as the Board Member/Board Support conference
hosted by the Board in 2015, the budget allocations for specific events serve as the
official authorization for the Chair to approve. For out-of-District budgeted events
only, the “RTD Travel Request and Authorization” form and the expense report
require approval from the Chair.
7.0.8.0.

Participation in Transit Related Community Events

A Director is eligible for reimbursement for normal, customary expenses associated
with attending an event for the Director and one guest, along with other approved
attendees as approved by the Chair, so long as the event is transit related. The
expenses of the Director and one guest are paid from the Director’s local expense
fund. The approved attendees will come from the general Board Office budget.
Directors may sponsor a transit related community event with advance approval of
the Chair. Any sponsorship costs will be deducted from the Director’s local expense
account.
8.0.9.0.

Participation in Community Non-Transit Related Events

Participation in community non-transit related events is supported by RTD with
approval of the benefit to the agency. Such events are essential in getting the
community involved in the mission and vision of RTD. At times the General Manager
or RTD outreach departments purchase a table at a community event and invite
Directors as ambassadors for RTD at no cost to the Director.;

Ban on Political Expenditures

At no time can a Director’s expense funds or RTD funds be used for any event or

10.0. Travel Insurance
RTD has in force a special Travel and Accident Policy for Directors while on official
business; therefore, additional travel insurance is not eligible for reimbursement.
11.0. Expense Reports
11.1. Travel Expense Reports
Pursuant to IRS guidelines, a Director must should submit a completed expense report
to the Board Office no later than the end of the month following the Director’s return
to the District. (e.g., If the trip was taken in October, the expense report is due no
later than by November 30th). The Executive Committee reserves the right to suspend
the provision of travel arrangements for any Director who is delinquent in submitting
an expense report. If extra time is needed to complete the expense report or the
Director has a valid reason for the delay, the Chair should be notified to make the
decision to extend this timeline.
The Board Office processes an one travel expense report, post travel, for each
Director traveling to an out-of-District conference or event. In order to provide
processing time for the staff to meet the deadline for submitting the reports to the
Chair, the Directors must submit original copies of all receipts, invoices, travel
itineraries, hotel bills, and associated include supporting documentation for expense
reimbursement. Directors should submit a signed completed expense report to the
Board Office within two weeks after returning from the a trip.
11.2. Local Expense Reports
Pursuant to IRS guidelines, in order to receive reimbursement for local expenses, a
Director must submit a completed monthly local expense report to the Board Office
within 90 days of the date of the incurred expense. In the months in which no
expenses are incurred or in which the Director does not wish to claim any expense,
the Director must still submit a signed report for the reporting month with zero
balance. The Board Office will process one local expense report for each month a
Director requests reimbursement.
