BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Build America Bonds

June 11, 2024

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
Build America Bonds (BABs) were introduced in 2009 as part of the American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act (ARRA), a federal program to create jobs and stimulate the economy during the 20082009 Great Recession.
The attractiveness of BABs for borrowers was enhanced availability of credit during the financial crisis
and the provision of interest rates that were competitive with issuing tax exempt debt because the
federal government provided a subsidy equal to 35% of the taxable interest expense.
In 2010, RTD issued $400 million of BABs to provide funding for capital expansion projects related to
FasTracks. The issuances consisted of $300 million of FasTracks sales tax bonds for infrastructure
construction and $100 million of certificates of participation (COPs), a form of lease-purchase financing,
for equipment purchases and to help fund the Sheridan and Lakewood•Wadsworth station parking
garages.
All of RTD’s borrowings, with the exception of BABs, have optional redemption provisions and fixed
interest rates, which provide flexibility in being able to refinance for interest savings, if future market
conditions allow. Conversely, BABs include extraordinary optional redemption provisions only allow a
lender to call (refinance) BABs due to an unusual event such as a change in law.
Beginning in 2011, federal spending cuts, also known as Sequestration, reduced the federal interest rate
subsidies on BABs resulting in higher debt service costs for borrowers (including RTD). While initial
impacts to RTD’s BABs were modest, this continued practice has also introduced additional interest rate
risk for RTD that is not present with other debt issuances.
It has been unclear until recently whether Sequestration represents an extraordinary redemption event.
Many issuers have exercised their extraordinary optional redemption provision and refinanced BABs over
the past year with no legal challenges.
DISCUSSION

Packet Pg. 3

1.C.1

Market conditions currently are attractive for RTD to refinance the $100 million of BABs COPs by
exercising the extraordinary optional redemption provision to reduce RTD’s exposure to higher net
interest costs resulting from Sequestration. While a potential BABs refinancing is not anticipated to
produce net significant interest savings and may even result in a modest net cost to RTD, a partial BABs
refinancing would mitigate interest rate risk for RTD.
The remaining $300 million of RTD’s BABs FasTracks bonds are not currently attractive from a
refinancing perspective due to the high cost of doing so under current market conditions.
RTD’s General Counsel, bond counsel and disclosure counsel have each agreed that the extraordinary
optional redemption provisions have been met and support the BAB refinancing. In addition, RTD’s
municipal financial advisor, Hilltop Securities, also agrees that a BAB refinancing would be beneficial for
RTD.
The attached presentation is provided for discussion purposes, and staff intends to present a
recommended action for Board approval in July 2024 to allow the General Manager and CEO and the
Chief Financial Officer to engage in the BAB refinancing.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The financial impact is anticipated to be negligible under current market conditions. Costs of the
refinancing would be included in the refinancing transaction, and a separate appropriation is not required
should the Board authorize the refinancing in July 2024.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights (TABOR) Ballot Initiative

June 11, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
June 25, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt the attached Resolution Number __, Series of 2024 submitting a
ballot question to the eligible electors of RTD at an election to be held on November 5, 2024, without
imposing any new tax or increasing any tax rate, authorizing RTD to continue to collect, retain and
spend all revenues it receives from whatever sources without regard to the limitations set forth in the
Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights (TABOR).
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Erik Davidson, Board Chair
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
TABOR is a 1992 voter-approved amendment to the Colorado Constitution that generally limits the
amount of revenue Colorado governments can retain and spend. TABOR requires voter approval to
increase taxes or retain excess revenues above certain limits that TABOR sets, as well as to issue
certain new multi-year financial obligations such as bond debt.
TABOR allows governments to retain and spend an annual amount based on the prior year’s actual
revenue plus a growth factor. For RTD, the TABOR annual revenue growth limit is determined by the
sum of the change in the Denver-Aurora-Lakewood Consumer Price Index (CPI) plus the net change in
new property construction. Revenues collected in a fiscal year that exceed these limits must be returned
to taxpayers.
Colorado governments can and have implemented voter-approved exemptions from TABOR’s revenue
and spending limitations, either for a fixed period of time or indefinitely. Exemption from TABOR’s
revenue and spending limits is referred to as being “de-Bruced” in reference to the author of the TABOR
constitutional amendment, Douglas Bruce.
In 1995, District voters exempted RTD from TABOR’s revenue and spending limitations through 2005.
In 1999, voters exempted RTD from TABOR’s revenue and spending limitations through the period
required to pay bond debt issued to finance the construction of certain light rail lines but not past 2026.
This voter-approved structure includes the 0.6% RTD sales and use tax, is referred to as the Base
System. The Base System bond debt will be fully repaid in November 2024, which will subject all of

Packet Pg. 16

1.E.1

RTD’s TABOR-applicable revenue, except the 0.4% sales and tax levied for RTD’s FasTracks Project
(discussed below), to TABOR’s growth limitations beginning in 2025.
In 2004, District voters authorized RTD to collect an additional 0.4% sales and use tax for the FasTracks
Project. Approval of this ballot measure also authorized RTD to issue a fixed amount of FasTracks bond
debt to finance the construction of the FasTracks transit expansion elements. The approved ballot
measure requires the “sunsetting” of the 0.4% FasTracks sales and use taxes, after the debt is repaid,
to the amount necessary to operate and maintain these FasTracks elements. The FasTracks debt will be
repaid by 2050. Further, the FasTracks voter authorization only applies to the 0.4% sales and use tax
resulting in all other TABOR-applicable FasTracks revenues being subject to TABOR limitations in 2025
in addition to the Base System revenues.
All of RTD’s TABOR applicable revenues, except the 0.4% FasTracks sales and use tax, will establish
the basis for calculating revenue limits for 2025.
2024 budget revenues are $1,352.1 million of which $668.5 million or 49.4% is subject to TABOR.
DISCUSSION
TABOR revenue growth limitations will limit the annual allowable growth in RTD’s revenue collections
beginning in 2025. Revenue collected in excess of these TABOR limits must be returned to taxpayers.
These revenue growth limitations will likely adversely impact RTD’s future availability of funding.
In order to maintain and continue the 1999 voter authorization, and without imposing any new tax or
increasing any tax rate, the resolution submits a ballot question to RTD eligible voters at the election to
be held on November 5, 2024, authorizing RTD to continue to collect, retain, and spend all revenues it
received from all sources without regard to TABOR limitations.
The resolution includes the Board of Directors formal endorsement and support for the ballot question at
an election to be held on November 5, 2024. It authorizes and directs the General Manager and CEO
(GM/CEO) or General Counsel to take all actions necessary or appropriate to effectuate the resolution,
including authorization to enter into intergovernmental agreements with each county clerk, and appoints
the General Counsel as the designated election official.
RTD is receiving the advice of Butler Snow LLP in regard to the ballot question and election.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The financial impact of this recommended action is to mitigate the financial risk associated with adverse
impacts to RTD’s revenue from TABOR.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Central Park Station Development Negotiation

June 11, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
June 25, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO or her designee to negotiate and
execute an Exclusive Negotiation Agreement (ENA) with Ulysses Development Group for the future lease
and development of the real property located at 3801 N Ulster Street, Denver, Colorado (the Property).
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Chessy Brady, Manager, Transit-Oriented Development
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD acquired what is now Central Park Station on the A Line from Stapleton Development Corporation
in two phases. In August 2010, RTD acquired eight acres for $1,057,047. Two years later, in July
2012, RTD acquired an additional 11.6 acres for $1,585,082. The land was originally purchased for the
Central Park Bus Facility and Park-n-Ride (PnR) and was later incorporated into the Eagle P3 Project to
serve the A Line. RTD purchased the property using federal grant funds under grant CO-03-0125. As of
2024, the bus facility serves as the operating base for nine routes (28, 37, 38, 42, 43, 65, 73, 88, and
105), and the PnR contains 1,521 spaces. The PnR is part of RTD’s parking management system but is
not maintained by Denver Transit Operators (DTO) through the Concession Agreement.
The subject of this Recommended Action item is the PnR’s westernmost parcel, located at 3801 N
Ulster Street, on the southwest corner of Smith Road and Ulster Street (the Property). The six-acre
Property has 651 transit parking spaces with very low parking utilization and very high development
potential. In February 2023, Ulysses Development Group (UDG) submitted Step 1 of RTD’s Unsolicited
Proposal Process for Joint Development (UPP), commencing a discussion between the developer and
RTD Planning staff. The UPP stems from the 2010 Board-adopted TOD Strategic Plan, which created a
more focused policy that guides RTD’s role in encouraging the creation of mixed-income communities
near transit. That plan was followed by the Board-approved Unsolicited Proposal Policy for Real Property
in 2015, which guides the UPP that developers must follow to pursue development on RTD property. In
2021, the Board approved the Equitable TOD Policy, encouraging the development of affordable housing
on RTD land.
In June 2023, UDG submitted the second step of the UPP, the Technical Review, proposing to replace
the site’s 651 parking spaces with approximately 800 units of affordable housing and community
amenities. The RTD Technical Review Committee, composed of Operations, Capital Programs, Safety

Packet Pg. 23

1.E.2

and Environmental Compliance, Transit Police and Emergency Management, Finance, Legal Services, and
Planning department staff, noted that parking utilization at Central Park stands at less than 30%, and
prior to the COVID-19 pandemic had hovered around only 50%. With this information, and with the
certainty that approximately 800 affordable units would generate more customers than 651 empty
parking spaces, the committee agreed that the parking space reduction was appropriate. Finding no fatal
technical flaws in the proposal, the committee approved the site for potential development, obtained
concurrence from each committee member’s department leader, and notified UDG of the committee’s
findings.
Planning staff then sought concurrence and approval from the General Manager and Chief Executive
Officer (GM/CEO) to terminate the UPP and immediately issue a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) to
develop affordable housing on the site. Departing from the UPP and proactively issuing an RFQ served
two purposes: first, it leveled the playing field by reducing UDG’s head-start on the project; second, it
streamlined the pre-development timeline by reducing the somewhat redundant review that is
purposefully built into the UPP. The UPP is intended for sites that are less desirable because such sites
only pencil under certain conditions and with the right developers. UDG’s proposal review demonstrated
that the Central Park site is more viable than previously thought because of changes in parking
utilization.
The GM/CEO agreed to the new direction, and Planning Department staff worked with the Contracting
and Procurement Division to issue the RFQ in November 2023. After a 90-day solicitation period, the
selection committee conditionally chose UDG based on its ambitious affordable housing program, access
to financial resources, and development experience. To continue to the next step in the joint
development process, RTD must execute an Exclusive Negotiation Agreement (ENA) with UDG.
DISCUSSION
If the Board adopts this recommended action, the agency may operationalize the 2021 Equitable TransitOriented Development Policy and further the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan priorities of Community Value,
Customer Excellence, and Financial Success by creating much-needed housing near transit, improving
transit access, and generating revenues for RTD.
The ENA will address, among other items:
•
•
•
•

Negotiation and design schedule
Project financing
Development plan (density, use, affordability)
RTD maintenance and operations requirements

The ENA will permit a 24-month negotiation period, commencing on the effective date of the ENA.
However, RTD may extend the term of the ENA at its sole discretion. Board authorization through a
future action will be required to lease the Property to UDG and begin construction.

Packet Pg. 24

1.E.2

As discussed during the May 14, 2024, Finance and Planning Committee meeting, ground lease
payments will be key to the ground lease negotiation. Statutory changes enacted following the 2024
legislative session removed the requirement that RTD receive fair market value when disposing of its
land, instead leaving full discretion to RTD to determine the ground lease or sale value. The Equitable
TOD Policy, adopted by the Board in April 2021, indicates that RTD can be flexible on price, but includes
no other guidance. As a path forward, staff will return to the Board with a recommended framework for
land value discussion based on existing policy and thorough research on the topic.
If RTD and UDG do not execute the ENA, are unable to negotiate a ground lease or any other necessary
agreements, or if the Board does not authorize disposition of the Property through a future action, RTD
will remain the property owner and any subsequent decisions regarding the Property would be subject to
Board approval. Staff will keep the Board apprised of the development process.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Approval of the ENA will have no financial impact to RTD.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Zero Fare for Youth Pilot

June 11, 2024

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
On July 25, 2023, the Board of Directors approved a new fare structure, policies and programs that
included one year of zero-fare transit for youth throughout the transit network. The fare changes were
developed as part of RTD’s Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis project, a yearlong review aimed
at creating a fare structure that is more equitable, affordable, and simple. Most of the fare changes were
implemented in January 2024.
The Zero Fare for Youth (ZFY) pilot program was made available for youth customers starting September
1, 2023, through August 31, 2024, through an exemption granted by the Federal Transit Administration
(FTA). Individuals 19 years of age and younger, regardless of residency or school enrollment, are eligible
for participation in the pilot program. Absent this pilot program, RTD collects a fare for individuals ages 6
through 19. Hence, RTD funded this one-year pilot program for the first year.
In May 2024, the Colorado General Assembly passed Senate Bill (SB) 24-032, Methods to Increase the
Use of Transit, which included $5 million of grant funding available to support the ZFY program after the
August 31, 2024, expiration of the pilot program. RTD will be positioned to apply for this grant funding
in July 2024.
During the May 14, 2024, Finance and Planning Committee, staff presented a discussion item regarding
the results of the equity analysis for the ZFY program pursuant to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of
1964. Through this analysis, staff determined, should RTD decide to make permanent the ZFY program,
that such fare changes do not present a disparate impact or disproportionate burden.
DISCUSSION
With the pending conclusion of the ZFY pilot program on August 31, 2024, this discussion item is
presented to provide information regarding the results of that pilot program with staff intending to
present recommended actions during the July 16, 2024, Finance and Planning Committee to approve the
ZFY Title VI equity analysis and to continue the ZFY program.

Packet Pg. 35

1.F.1

In March 2024, a mid-year program evaluation was conducted to determine the operational and ridership
impacts of youth ridership occurring during the pilot program. During the observation period of
September 2023 through February 2024, bus operators manually counted, by pressing a specific button
on the onboard electronic fareboxes, the number of youths they observed boarding. The youth count
data was tabulated by route, month as well as bus operating division and resulted in an estimated
monthly count of youth on 98 bus routes (113 bus routes were operating in the September 2023
schedule and 109 in the January 2024 schedule). MallRide, paratransit, FlexRide and rail youth ridership
was not included in the observed data due to a lack of reliable methods for tabulation.
Bus operator data indicate that youth ridership counts on bus routes increased between 24-57% over
the prior year, between October 2023 and February 2024. Averaging these five months and adjusting
for the smaller share of youth ridership on rail versus bus, youth boardings are estimated to increase by
36% over 2023 for the calendar year 2024. Within RTD’s 2025-2029 financial forecast, it is estimated
that systemwide ridership will increase by 2% each of the next four years. Like systemwide ridership,
youth ridership is expected to remain at the higher level experienced during the ZFY pilot program and
increase annually by an estimated 2%. The table below demonstrates the estimated annual youth
ridership through 2028.

As contemplated in RTD’s systemwide fare study and equity analysis, forgone revenue attributed to ZFY
was estimated in February 2023 to be $4.3 million. This estimate assumed that there would be no
change in youth fare and that systemwide annual youth boardings would increase 58.7% from 20212023. Upon further analysis, systemwide youth ridership growth was reduced to 31.2% for inclusion in
the October 2023 financial forecast. The result was that estimated forgone youth revenue decreased to
$3.6 million in 2023. Using the youth counts received on bus routes plus an estimate from consulting
engagements, actual forgone youth revenue in 2023 was determined to be $3.7 million.

Packet Pg. 36

1.F.1

The operational impacts of the ZFY pilot program have been minimal. RTD Transit Police and contracted
security personnel indicate that there have been no systemic issues related to the ZFY pilot program.
RTD contacted 17 school districts within the RTD service area to determine whether there has been any
improvement in truancy rates due to the ZFY pilot program. The Boulder Valley School District reported
experiencing combined above-average gains in attendance since the launch of the ZFY pilot program.
Englewood schools shared that more students are using RTD to get to and from school and students and
staff are using RTD services for field trips. Based on these and other responses, the ZFY pilot program
was one of many factors that helped these schools return to approaching pre-pandemic attendance
rates.
Public outreach regarding the continuation of the ZFY program will be in conjunction with public
meetings regarding the upcoming September 2024 service changes. RTD will host in-person and virtual
public meetings to communicate the proposed changes, answer questions, and collect feedback from
customers, stakeholders, and the community. There are six meetings scheduled to take place the week
of June 18-26, 2024. In addition to these public meetings, staff will also be available to answer
questions about the proposed extension of the ZFY program during its participation at community
events.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The estimated forgone revenue has been revised to use 2022 revenue as the base year. Additionally, the
average fare per boarding has been adjusted down to account for the 2024 revised fare structure. The
forgone revenue in 2025 is estimated to be $2.9 million. Estimated forgone revenue for the subsequent
years is shown in the table below.

SB032, which passed in May 2024 and was subsequently signed into law, specifically appropriates up
to $5 million to RTD in FY2024-25, provided that the agency applies for the grant. Should RTD apply
and be approved for this grant, funds can be used to offset expenses associated with an increase in
ridership, provide operating support for its transit operations and general transit programs, and to pay for

Packet Pg. 37

1.F.1

other expenses necessary to implement and measure the effectiveness of the program. This includes but
is not limited to reasonable marketing expenses and expenses incurred conducting customer surveys.
In addition to the forgone youth revenue estimated above, additional funds will be necessary to continue
the ZFY program for marketing awareness and informational reminders across RTD’s transit network,
language assistance and effective communications, a survey for youth customers or their guardians, and
an annual report. RTD estimates these costs to total approximately $410,000 from September 1, 2024
– August 31, 2025. Therefore, the $5 million in available grant funding is expected to offset forgone
revenue as well as additional expenses continuation of a ZFY program from September 1, 2024 –
August 31, 2025.
