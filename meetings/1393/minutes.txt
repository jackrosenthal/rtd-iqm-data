Construction Contract Award to Krische Construction for Southwest and
Central Platte Valley Corridors 4-Car Platform Extension Phase II.
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD
Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or designee, to execute all
documents necessary to award a construction contract to Krische
Construction in the amount of $2,271,446 for the Southwest and Central
Platte Valley Corridors 4-Car Platform Extension Phase II. Funding for this
contract is provided through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of
2009 (ARRA), and is included in the 2009 Adopted Budget.

Director Pulliam made a motion to forward
this item to the full board at the August

MOTION:

The motion passed unanimously.

Purchase of approximately 33 miles of track on the Boulder Industrial Lead
(North Metro)
Rick Clarke indicated that last month the board approved the purchase of
right of way from Union Pacific Railroad that did not include track materials.
This action is to buy the track materials which was offered for over 6 million
– we didn’t act on it and since the price has come down. The existing rail is
not suitable for usage of passenger trains.
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of
Directors approve the purchase of approximately 33 miles of track located on
the newly acquired Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR) Boulder Industrial Lead from
the UPRR. UPRR sold the Right of Way to RTD, but retained the salvage
rights to the track. Cost to the FasTracks program would be $3.6 million,
which is included in the 2009 Adopted Budget for the North Metro Corridor.
MOTION:

Director Pulliam made a motion to forward
this item to the full board at the August
18, 2009 Board Meeting.
