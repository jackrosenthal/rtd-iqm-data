BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Monthly Government Relations Report – May 2023

May 18, 2023

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Davies, Government Relations Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
Pursuant to the Board-adopted 2023 Legislative Program, the agency developed a Legislative Program
that serves as a guiding document for staff to pursue goals related to legislative and policy matters. A
Legislative Program serves as a living document that can be adjusted throughout a legislative session to
provide an avenue for Board-adopted policy positions to be communicated and pursued by agency staff.
In line with the agency’s mission and vision established in the Strategic Plan, the development and
inclusion of the goals and actions contained in the Legislative Program are designed to make lives better
through connections.
It is important that RTD serve as a trusted partner to the region’s local, state, and federal elected
officials. To achieve these goals, RTD must be proactive in educating and informing the District’s elected
officials of the challenges and opportunities available to advance shared goals.
In furtherance of the program, the agency’s Government Relations Officer coordinates and develops
strategic communications to advance the agency’s legislative priorities and serve as a point of contact
for elected officials in the Denver metro region.
DISCUSSION
Included herein are notable government relations highlights at the federal, state and local levels since the
last Executive Committee meeting held on April 20, 2023. This report was prepared on May 9, 2023,
and will be updated verbally as needed during the Executive Committee meeting scheduled for Thursday,
May 18, 2023.
Federal
At the federal level, as the House and Senate Appropriations committees continue deliberations amid
tense national budget/debt ceiling negotiations, appropriations for public transit programs in Federal
Fiscal Year (FFY2024) could be impacted as compared with FFY2023 appropriations due to lower than
expected Housing and Urban Development program revenues. Staff will continue to monitor
developments on this topic closely to discern any potential negative impacts to RTD.

Packet Pg. 4

1.4.1

State
The Colorado General Assembly adjourned Sine Die on Monday, May 8, 2023. The only bill garnering
formal Board support this legislative session was House Bill 23-1101 (HB1101), Ozone Season Transit
Grant Program Flexibility, which was enacted on Friday, April 28, 2023.
Related to HB1101, staff has worked closely with the Colorado Energy Office regarding the agency’s
2023 Ozone Season Transit Grant Program request, which would allow RTD to be reimbursed for a
portion of fare revenue not collected during the anticipated Zero Fare for Better Air period during the
summer months.
Local
At the local level, the agency continues to proactively engage with staff and elected officials
representing cities and counties throughout the service area and to provide updates on RTD programs
and projects. Staff is scheduled to engage with Denver City Council on Wednesday, June 7, 2023, to
provide a briefing on the Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis and Respect the Ride outreach
efforts.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Grant Agreement with Colorado Energy Office to
Implement 2023 Ozone Season Transit Grant Program

May 9, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
May 23, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO or her designee to enter an
Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with the Colorado Energy Office and to authorize the transfer of up
to $2,200,000 from the Unrestricted Fund to effectuate the 2023 Ozone Season Transit Grant
Agreement.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Davies, Government Relations Officer
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
Enacted in 2022, Senate Bill 22-180 created the Ozone Season Transit Grant Program (grant program)
within the Colorado Energy Office. The grant program allows RTD and other state transit agencies to
apply for funding to implement a minimum of 30 days’ zero-fare transit service for all transit services
offered. House Bill 23-1101, which was subsequently enacted in 2023, made changes to the grant
program, removing the 20% match requirement for RTD and increasing the amount of available funding
during the 2023 grant cycle.
In August 2022, RTD implemented a Zero Fare for Better Air period, whereby the agency offered zerofare transit across all transit modes. Compared to July 2022 data, ridership increased 22% during the
fare-free period in August 2022. Additionally, the agency did not experience any major operational
impacts during the Zero Fare for Better Air period, nor did quality-of-life or crime-related incident reports
increase.
Overall, RTD experienced a 22% increase in ridership during the Zero Fare for Better Air period, which
ran from August 1 through August 30, 2023. Furthermore, customers and stakeholders expressed
satisfaction and provided positive feedback regarding the experience of utilizing the agency’s services
during the Zero Fare for Better Air period.
DISCUSSION
Staff is recommending the transfer of up to $2,200,000 from the Unrestricted Fund to be used to
implement a Zero Fare for Better Air period during the months of July and August 2023.

Packet Pg. 6

2.16.A

Through the removal of the 20% match requirement for RTD and the availability of additional funding in
2023, RTD is able to invest a similar amount of funding as compared to 2022 and fully fund a Zero Fare
for Better Air program to deliver two months of zero-fare transit services in 2023.
As outlined by the feedback received following the 2022 Zero Fare for Better Air period, seeking to
utilize all available grant funding to deliver an additional month of zero-fare transit services would align
with the agency Strategic Priorities of Community Value, Customer Excellence, and Financial Success.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The financial impact associated with the provision of two months of zero-fare transit, in July and August
2023, is estimated to be up to $2,200,000 in RTD funds, which will be combined with those derived
from the grant program. The funds will be used to offset a portion of fare revenue not collected during
the zero-fare period. Further, these funds will be used for marketing and advertising expenses and
expenses related to gathering customer feedback.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Proposed 2023-2024 Internal Audit Plan

May 9, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
May 23, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the 2023-2024 Internal Audit Plan.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Audit Committee Charter was approved by the Board on October 25, 2022, which requires the
Audit Committee, consistent with the Internal Audit Function Charter and subject to Board approval, to:
•

Recommend approval of the risk-based annual audit plan and all major changes to the plan

The annual audit plan directs the activities of the internal audit function performed by RubinBrown, LLP
for RTD. Each internal audit project is developed based on the annual enterprise risk assessment with the
intent to perform audits which provide the greatest impact to RTD’s ability to achieve its strategic plan
and goals. The annual audit plan may be modified at any time by the Chief Audit Executive to adjust for
changing circumstances and new information. Any proposed significant deviation from the approved
internal audit plan must be communicated in advance to Executive Leadership and the Audit Committee
and approved by the Board. Internal audit results will be communicated to the Audit Committee at least
quarterly. Audit Committee activities will be reported to the Board at each Board meeting.
DISCUSSION
The Proposed 2023-2024 Internal Audit Plan recommends audits to be undertaken through the end of
2024. Each proposed audit has been selected in response to the results of the enterprise risk
assessment which was most recently updated to include input from Executive Leadership, the Audit
Committee, and the Board in early 2023, and presented to the Audit Committee on April 6, 2023. In
addition, each proposed audit has an estimate of the number of hours necessary to complete the audit.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The contract for internal audit services with RubinBrown was approved by the Board on June 28, 2022,
for three years plus two option years with a not-to-exceed value over five years of $3,212,105. The
financial impact has been included in the 2023 Budget.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Allied Universal Security Services Second Contract Option
Year

May 10, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
May 23, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO), or her designee, to
execute the second option year of the existing security services contract with Allied Universal Security
(AUS) for a total cost not to exceed $20,455,408.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Dr. Joel Fitzgerald, Chief of Police and Emergency Management
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
The current RTD security model consists of internal police officers, secondary employment officers from
local jurisdictions, and contracted security officers to provide security for RTD customers, facilities, and
property.
On July 11, 2019, following a comprehensive procurement process, AUS was awarded a three-year
contract with three one-year options to provide system-wide security services. The initial contract term
expired June 30, 2022, and RTD executed the first option year term from July 1, 2022, to June 30,
2023. A second option year term would further extend the contract from July 1, 2023, to June 30,
2024.
Currently, the range of services provided under the contract terms include but are not limited to:
• Critical infrastructure security at RTD facilities including bus and rail stations
• Fare enforcement
• Patrol services
• Enhanced security presence during large-scale events
• Integrated security technology services
• Security command and dispatch center staffing and monitoring
DISCUSSION
Staff recommends that the Board authorize the GM/CEO to execute the second option year of the three
one-year options for AUS to continue providing system-wide security services.
In adopting this recommended action, the agency seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan priorities
of Community Value and Customer Excellence. Specifically:

Packet Pg. 19

2.17.B

• The perceived value of RTD in terms of Community Value would be enhanced through:
o The hiring of additional unarmed security officers to serve in ambassador and customer
service roles, and
o Continued deployment of contracted security personnel in higher visibility uniforms,
yielding a greater sense of employee, customer, and overall community security in areas
RTD serves.
• Increased Customer Excellence would be achieved through the continued ability to deploy
unarmed security guards on commuter rail services, thereby improving system reliability and
decreasing delays
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The financial impact associated with the adoption of the recommended action is $20,455,408, of which
$10,227,704 will be accounted for within the FY2023 Amended Budget. The remaining funds require
incorporation into the FY2024 Budget. Moreover, due to the reduction in the scope of services over the
life of the contract, the cost of the second option year is $4,256,448 less than the original projected
cost for this option year.
