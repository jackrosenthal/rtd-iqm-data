BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
ADA Paratransit Eligibility Assessments/Travel Training

Committee Meeting Date:
May 4, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
May 4, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
To authorize the General Manager and CEO, or her designee, to execute all documents necessary to
enter into a contract with Medical Transportation Management, Inc. (MTM) for the provision of ADA
paratransit eligibility functional assessments and travel training for a five-year period and an amount not
to exceed $4,735,769.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Ford, Chief Operations Officer
Paul Hamilton, Senior Manager, Paratransit Services
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 Minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD requires all applicants for Access-a-Ride services to participate in an in-person functional
assessment. Functional assessments enable RTD to determinate eligibility for ADA paratransit services
within three eligibility categories under the ADA. The three categories include determining whether an
individual: 1) is unable to understand how to complete bus or light rail trips due to a cognitive
deficiency; 2) requires a lift-equipped bus or light rail vehicle and such accommodations are unavailable
(this category no longer applies as all RTD services are accessible); or 3) is unable to navigate
independently to and from a bus stop or light rail station.
DISCUSSION
On January 5, 2021, RTD issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) soliciting technical and price proposals
to provide paratransit eligibility assessments and travel training services. On February 8, 2021, RTD
received proposals from the following firms:
ADA Ride.com
Easter Seals Colorado
Medical Transportation Management, Inc. (MTM)
Transdev
A panel was assembled to evaluate the proposals based on the following evaluative criteria:
experience of the firm and individuals proposed for key positions and disciplines (35%);
understanding of RTD’s requirements and objectives in relation to the specifics of the scope of work
(35%); and cost (30%). The evaluation panel consisted of RTD’s Senior Manager, Paratransit
Services; Manager, Paratransit Services; and Paratransit Eligibility Program Coordinator. Two
members from the disability community participated on the evaluation panel and advised staff.
Based on the average of the individual scores received, MTM was deemed the most technically
qualified proposer for award. The score for the “Cost” element was calculated by RTD Procurement
staff and was then added to the technical score of the proposal to determine the overall total score.

1.B.1

MTM’s experience with providing eligibility evaluations and travel training nationally, and the
experience of their proposed staff were key elements of their proposal.
Performance under the contract is for a five-year period and shall not exceed $4,735,769 for a fiveyear term.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for this contract for Calendar Year 2021 is included in the 2021 Budget that was appropriated
by the Board of Directors. Future contract year funding will be included in annual budget appropriation
requests.

Introduction of Debra A. Johnson, RTD General Manager & CEO
Vivian Morales introduced Debra A. Johnson, RTD General Manager and Chief Executive Officer.
Debra A. Johnson introduced herself and opened the floor for questions. Jaime Lewis exhorted GM
Johnson to work with staff on closing the feedback loop on suggestions from advisory committees
that may not be accepted by staff. Debra A. Johnson confirmed her commitment to work with staff
and close loops on suggestions that may not be adopted.
Access-A-Ride Paratransit Advisory Committee
1. Introduction of the topic of selection of APAC Member to Provide Verbal Summaries to the
RTD Board
Brenda Carney graciously volunteered to verbally update RTD Board meeting tonight, March
9th, as she was selected by APAC to give updates to ACPD. APAC will nominate and select
someone formally at the May APAC mtg.
2. COVID-19 Response - Capacity restrictions increased– Larry Buter, RTD
COVID19 capacity restrictions during most of the last year were 1 passenger a vehicle, this
was largely possible because more vehicles/operators were available due to decreased
ridership. Now, the capacity is a maximum of 3 per vehicle (unless from the same household).
This still allows social distancing while providing increased capacity as demand has begun to
return.
3. Pilot a Ride-Share (Uber) Model – Andi Bailey, Uber & Larry Buter, RTD
• Stage 1 (for ambulatory riders and those with wheelchairs that fold/fit in sedan trunk) –
for eligible riders in four zip codes (80013, 80014, 80015, and 80016); they pay $2 for an
Uber X or XL vehicle; and are allowed up to 60 subsidized trips.
• Stage 2 (for fixed wheelchair riders, using RTD vehicles and MV operators) – this stage
will begin roll-out on April 12, 2021, and will expand the pilot area to include eligible riders
in an additional three zip codes (80011, 80012, and 80017).
• ACPD volunteered to help with promotion of this pilot program.
• ACTION: Send Uber’s prepared presentation to all (was not shown during meeting but
will be distributed electronically after the meeting).
4. Mobile App/Web Portal – Larry Buter, RTD
• Beta testing on newest changes was completed and the most recent update to the web
portal went live last month.
• Usage numbers: 4000 user accounts created; 4000 trips booked, with 1000 trips canceled;
7000 pick up/arrival messages sent, and 10,9000 ETA messages sent,
• ACTION: Send the link and access instruction to the group.
5. Eligibility and Training Vendor RFP – Larry Buter, RTD
• In response to the release of the ADA Assessment/Travel Training RFP, RTD has received
several proposals/bids that are being evaluated.
• A review committee, including 2 additional stakeholders (Donna Thurston, Laradon Hall
and current APAC member; and Krystin Trustman, RTD Oversight and Operations
Subcommittee member and former APAC member), are reviewing all proposals, and will
meet soon for a final review and discussion.
• The RTD Board of Directors will consider the committee’s evaluation and final
recommendation and is expected to make a determination in April.
6. Dispatch and Scheduling Software RFP – Larry Buter, RTD

7. Review of Vehicle Specifications Process (coming soon) – Paul Hamilton, RTD
• All RTD vehicles meet ADA requirements; the majority of the fleet, the newest vehicles,
exceed ADA requirements due to APAC’s input on vehicle specifications five years ago.
• RTD maintenance is ready to replace the 600 series vehicles, approximately 66 buses in
2022 (this amount is subject to change) and needs APAC’s input on specifications for the
new/replacement vehicles.
• At the next APAC meeting, members will volunteer for the input process; the process
includes in-person meetings at the maintenance facility to review vehicles and provide
input. If social distancing is still mandatory, the meeting will be held virtually.
• Current vehicle maximums: 3 mobility devices and up to 4 seats or 8 seats without any
mobility devices on board.
