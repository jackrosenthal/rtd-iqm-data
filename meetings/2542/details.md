#### 1. Approval To Transfer Funds And To Enter Into Contracts With Multiple Charter Bus Providers For Auxiliary Bus Services

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors approves RTD entering into master contracts with MCITP/MCTS, Ramblin Express, Denver Public Schools, Western Transportation Services, Colorado Tour Lines (dba.Gray Line) and Ace Express to provide auxiliary bus service and further to transfer $1,000,000 from the FasTracks Board appropriated reserve to fund such services.

Motion:               Director Bagley made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the November 29, 2016 Board Meeting.

Director Sisk seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, requested a blanket purchase order to utilize various bus charter companies to provide necessary bus service as needed.  He stated that in order to process a purchase order, a funding source needs to be identified, so he is requesting a transfer of funds from the FasTracks appropriate reserve to be held into a special account. He added that the primary purpose of this action item is to provide contingency service planning, and as the Board may be aware, staff secures the services of charter companies for Monday and Thursday night football games.  He noted that the funds will not be utilized unless absolutely necessary.  He added that staff anticipates reimbursement by Denver Transit Partners (DTP) should RTD need to provide any bus bridge service for the FasTracks corridors.

Director Bagley emphasized the importance of this item and commented that the Board needs to be proactive so staff can be prepared.  He noted that this is will constitute a Plan B, should there be any issues with the University of Colorado A line, B line and in the future, the G line.  Director Deadwyler said she likes this idea, but asked if RTD would be reimbursed by DTP if we have to call in auxiliary service for the University of Colorado A line.

Bruce Abel indicated that staff anticipates being reimbursed by DTP.

Director Francone asked if staff was confident that DTP would reimburse RTD.

Bruce Abel commented that it would depend on the circumstances, but there are areas outlined in our contract that would clearly define reimbursement scenarios.

Director Anderson said she had no comments, but noted that she would be voting in favor of this item.

#### 2. Free Rides for Members of the Military

It is recommended by the Operations & Customer Services Committee that free rides on RTD for active duty members of the United States Military should be extended from the presently approved date of December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017. Utilization has been minimal to date and this extension will have minimal impact on RTD.

Motion:               Director Folska made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the November 29, 2016 Board Meeting.

Director Deadwyler seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager of Communications, noted that RTD has offered free rides for members of the Military for the past 10 years. He noted that there is a minimal financial impact to offering this service, and it is a good program to offer the military community.  He explained that anyone with an active military ID, or anyone in uniform can ride RTD’s services for free.

Director Deadwyler asked if RTD kept a tally of how many people utilize this service.

Bruce Abel explained that staff tallies free rides but there is a wide variety of groups that utilize the free ride service; so it would be difficult to pin-point an exact number.

Director Deadwyler added that she has received several calls where Military constituents were denied their free ride due to lack of ID.  She asked how staff is ensuring that they are getting a free ride?

Scott Reed stated that military personnel must be in uniform, or have an active military ID card with them.

Bruce Abel added that the manner in which operators have been trained require that they be shown an active military ID card, or military members must be in uniform.

Director Hoy stated that he did not see any language within the action item that covered Police, EMT or Firefighters.

Scott Reed indicated the policy regarding first responders is a standing policy without an expiration date, which is separate from this item.

Bruce Abel explained that this item is usually brought to the Board around Veteran’s Day, to affirm RTD’s appreciation of our veterans.

Chair Tobiassen stated that the military personnel he has worked with greatly appreciate this service offered to them.  He remarked that this provides an opportunity for RTD to let the military know that we support them.

Director Anderson said it is great that RTD does this every year around the same time to recall the dedication that has been given to our country by our military personnel.

#### 3. 2016-020 : RTD Bylaws Amendments

It is recommended by the Executive Committee and General Counsel that the Board of Directors approve the amended Bylaws as outlined and attached through the November 15th Operations and Customer Service Committee meeting.

Motion:               Director Bagley made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the November 29, 2016 Board Meeting.

Director Deadwyler seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Rolf Asphaugh, General Counsel, indicated there were a few changes based on comments from the Board.  He noted that staff added Completion to the FasTracks Committee name since we are in the completion phase of FasTracks.  He remarked that the order of committee meetings was suggested, but the calendar changes so often that it will remain the decision of the Chair and staff as to the order that best makes sense and to enshrine that in the Bylaws would be too rigid.  He added that most changes were for housekeeping purposes.

Director Lubow said she will vote against this item due to her concern of the super majority.

Director Anderson indicated that she would be voting in favor of this item.

##### a. 2016-11-29 Bylaws Final

##### b. 2016-Bylaw Amendments - Proposed - Redline v2

#### 4. Approval of Updates to the Local and Travel Policy for the RTD Board of Directors

It is recommended by the Chair of the Board and the Executive Committee that the Board of Directors approve the amended Local and Travel Policy as outlined and attached through the November 15th Operations and Customer Service Committee meeting.

Motion:               Director Deadwyler made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the November 29, 2016 Board Meeting.

Director Archuleta seconded the motion.

Barbara McManus, Executive Manager to the Board Office indicated that there were very few changes since the last meeting, and most were grammatical in nature.

Director Anderon said she would vote in the affirmative for this item.

Director Menten asked if the annual IT expenses were being reduced from $2340 to $1680.

Barbara McManus said yes, that was correct.  She added that if the Board wanted to reduce their local or travel expenses, that would require a separate action item.

##### a. 2016- BOD Expense Policy V2 Clean

##### b. 2016- BOD Expense Policy V2 Redlined

#### 1. VW Settlement - RTD Comments Regarding The Use Of The VW Settlement

Bruce Abel stated that some time ago, Volkswagen (VW) was found guilty of lying about mileage results to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other government agencies.  He said there was a settlement, and a substantial amount of those funds, $61 million to be exact, will be given to the State of Colorado.  He stated that the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) has been charged to determine how the funds will be used.  Included in the Operations & Customer Service packet is a letter that the General Manager sent to CDPHE requested that a portion of those funds be set aside for the acquisition of electric transit vehicles and the related infrastructure and support facilities.  He noted that staff will keep the Board apprised of any updates in regards to RTD’s request.

#### 2. A Line, B Line (no back-up)

General Manager Genova said staff had not had an opportunity to brief the Board on the latest waiver extension from the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) for the University of Colorado A line and the B line.  He stated that staff is operating under a new waiver, largely due to the need for attendants at the rail crossings.  He explained that crossing attendants are only supposed to be used in the short term for emergencies or repair work, and are not meant to be a long term solution.  He noted that the FRA gave RTD a three-week extension on October 14th, which included a requirement that an independent assessment of the crossings be completed.  Denver Transit Partners (DTP) brought in HNTB and they worked quickly to complete the assessment and provide the final report to the FRA.

General Manager Genova said the assessment by HNTB identified five action items to address.  Of those five items, the first two relate to positive train controls and relating software and the other three were for conventional train controls.  He said the first four are short in duration and they should be addressed in 8 to 12 weeks.  The fifth item relates to more conventional work and that item has a much longer timeframe; close to 5 to 6 months.  He explained that the new FRA extension is good until February 4, 2017, and they understand that action item 5 will take longer to implement due to design, installation and testing.  He added that RTD has begun to provide the FRA with weekly and monthly reports, and staff also committed to traveling to the FRA headquarters for monthly interface meetings.  He remarked that staff hopes to have made significant progress with the action plan by December 12th, and we continue to test on the University of Colorado A line and B line.  He commented that staff is unable to perform tests on the G line until the FRA approves us to do so.  He noted that staff hopes to have more information after the December 12th meeting with the FRA.

Director Folska thanked staff and said it is clear that they are all working towards fixing the issues.  She added that anytime new software comes out, it takes time to patch and fix any bugs.

Director Menten inquired about the costs to address items 1-5, and asked if DTP will be paying for those updates.

General Manager Genova said staff anticipates, and RTD’s stance, is that DTP will pay for the updates as it is outlined in the concessionaire agreement.  He noted that RTD will pay for RTD travel costs to attend the FRA meetings, but staff is evaluating opportunities to have our travel costs reimbursed.

Director Menten asked if any of these changes will address the Quiet Zones.

General Manager Genova said once RTD and DTP work through and successfully address items 1-5, staff can submit the application for the Quiet Zones.

Henry Stopplecamp, Assistant General Manager of Capital Programs, said the applications are ready to go.  After issues 1-5 are resolved the applications can be submitted and they should take three weeks to be approved.

Director Deadwyler asked how the current extension will work, considering item 5 will take longer than 90 days.

General Manager Genova indicated that the 90-day extension is to keep RTD’s feet to the fire to ensure we are working to make progress.  He remarked that he is confident RTD will get another extension as the FRA fully understood the timing of the five items, and RTD is providing objective evidence to show improvements.

Director Deadwyler added that she has not had any complaints from her district lately.  She said there have been improvements, and her constituents are happy.

Director Francone commented that the Board would like to know the contents of the weekly updates to the FRA and that information should be shared with the public.  She added that there is a lot of misinformation out there and the more RTD can provide to the public, it would only help them understand what is going on.

General Manager Genova said staff discussed that today, and they will see what information can be pulled from the weekly report to be distributed to the public.  He added that DTP is learning how to escalate issues from an operations standpoint to make necessary service improvements if there are issues.

Director Anderson said for the past 14 years, Arvada has had excellent service to the airport.  She stated that right now, people have to go to Boulder County or drive themselves, and she asked that RTD provide hourly airport service until the G line is open.  She added that RTD should communicate with Arvada residents to let them know when the G line will open as she has received several ugly emails.  She remarked that RTD staff should communicate service updates to the public to help her inform the community.

### D. Other Matters

General Manager Genova stated the R line is in its final stages before the project is completed. He commented that staff is currently working on phase B2, the most complex area, being tested overnight.  He said that staff anticipates that we will have a firm opening date by the end of the week.  He remarked that the City of Aurora has been a great partner by providing traffic control and police officers on site during testing.

Director Folska questioned the efficiency of the testing if it is being conducted during low traffic times.  She also asked what the possibility is for the R line to open by end of the year.

General Manager Genova stated that integrated testing along with a safety and certification process will take place first.  After that initial phase, it will be turned over to the operations team who will begin training operators and running the simulated schedule.  He stated that this process usually takes 6-8 weeks.  He explained that there are a lot of challenges at the end of the year, and our stakeholders would prefer not to open during the holiday season.  He indicated that once testing is completed, staff will have a better timeline of when the line can open.

Director Francone said Accelerate Colorado is very interested in doing something on the V.I.P. level.

Bruce Abel stated that there have been challenges around bus service due to missed service hours due to the labor shortage.  He remarked that October was a very challenging month and the trend is no longer going in the proper direction.  While lost service hours were significantly down during the summer months, they have increased and will be an issue until after the beginning of the year.

Bruce Abel added that the Go Centennial pilot project has mirrored the Dry Creek Call-n-Ride and it has been working with Lyft to provide rides to constituents.  He stated that the City of Centennial is funding the cost of the trip for people, which originally was from Dry Creek to the rail station.  The month of August averaged 7 trips per day, and September averaged 10 trips per day.  Due to low ridership numbers, the pilot program has since adjusted the service parameters and will now take someone anywhere they want to go in Centennial.

Director Lubow stated that it is disappointing to hear that the lost service hours have increased.  She said that she was under the impression that the bonus incentives were assisting in the hiring practices.

Bruce Abel said the applicant flow has slowed down and staff is currently working with Human Resources and Marketing to find solutions.
