BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

Date: November 9, 2016

From:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

November 9, 2016

Board Meeting Date: November 29, 2016

Subject:

Approval To Transfer Funds And To Enter Into
Contracts With Multiple Charter Bus Providers
For Auxiliary Bus Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
approves RTD entering into master contracts with MCITP/MCTS, Ramblin Express, Denver Public
Schools, Western Transportation Services, Colorado Tour Lines (dba.Gray Line) and Ace Express to
provide auxiliary bus service and further to transfer $1,000,000 from the FasTracks Board appropriated
reserve to fund such services.
BACKGROUND
As part of RTD’s on-going contingency planning efforts, RTD recently issued a Request for Quotations
(RFQ16DH043) for charter bus services to be provided in response to RTD request for “bus bridges” as
may be required for Eagle project services (University of Colorado A-Line, B-Line or G-Line after its
opening). This solicitation was for on-call services in order to obtain vehicles and drivers to provide the
services requested by RTD. In addition, these service providers could be engaged to provide
supplemental “BroncosRide” service for weeknight games when RTD does not have adequate capacity
to meet the demand. Currently supplemental BroncosRide service is procured on a game by game basis
through the issuance of individual RFQ’s for each game.
This procurement will result in “blanket-style” or “work order” type contracts that will fund multiple
purchase orders to multiple service providers/vendors. Funds will not be “encumbered” or used until
such time as a purchase order is issued for a particular piece of work.
Six vendors responded to the RFQ and all were selected to participate. The vendors are:
 MCITP/MCTS
 Ramblin Express
 Denver Public Schools
 Western Transportation Service
 Colorado Tour Line (d.b.a . Gray Line)
 Ace Express Coaches
Because of the potential need for this service on a 24/7 basis, each contractor that provided a quote will
be awarded a Blanket Purchase Order (BPO) with a Not to Exceed amount based on the number of buses
that they have available to provide requested services.
DISCUSSION
These service providers will be used to provide auxiliary bus service (“bus bridges” etc.) for planned
delays or shutdowns on Eagle project services related to maintenance, engineering and inspection work
periods. Due to mobilization time requirements, it is not likely that these service providers will be used
to provide emergency response service for auxiliary bus services necessitated by unplanned events or
“spur of the moment” needs. Potential use for supplemental BroncosRide service would also be on a pre-

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

planned basis as is currently done. Due to mobilization time requirements, immediate response service
will continue to be provided by RTD.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The financial impact will not exceed $1,000,000 and is estimated to be less than that as we anticipate
that RTD will be reimbursed from DTP depending on the use of the auxiliary bus services. These funds
are available from the FasTracks Board appropriated reserve. Funding for supplemental BroncosRide
service is available in the approved 2016 RTD budget and is included in the 2017 Requested budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Approve the staff recommended action.
2. Don’t approve the staff recommended action. This is not recommended action as there will not
be contracts or funding in place if DTP needs to have planned or extended shutdowns related to
maintenance, engineering, and inspection work periods.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

Date: November 8, 2016

From:

Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

November 8, 2016

Board Meeting Date: November 29, 2016

Subject:

Free Rides for Members of the Military

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations & Customer Services Committee that free rides on RTD for active
duty members of the United States Military should be extended from the presently approved date of
December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017. Utilization has been minimal to date and this extension will
have minimal impact on RTD.
BACKGROUND
At the October 30, 2006 Special Board Meeting, the RTD Board of Directors approved a resolution
allowing active duty U.S. Military personnel to ride free on all RTD services through the end of 2006.
This offer has been extended annually by the Board since that time and is now valid through December
31, 2016. As a result of these actions, all active duty members of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines,
Coast Guard, National Guard, and Reserves are entitled to ride free on any RTD service including special
services such as SkyRide and BroncosRide. To be eligible to ride for free, active duty military personnel
must either be in uniform or present an active duty military ID card.
DISCUSSION
Staff recommends that the RTD Board of Directors extend this offer beyond the current expiration date
of December 31, 2016 and that the expiration date be extended by one year at this time and revisited
again next year.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The exact financial impact of this action is not known, but is expected to be minimal.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Extend free rides on RTD for active duty members of the United States Military should from the
presently approved date of December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017. This is the staff
recommendation.
2. Do not extend RTD’s program offering free rides for active duty members of the United States
Military.

From:

Tom Tobiassen, Chair of the Board

Date:

November 11, 2016

Board Meeting Date: November 29, 2016

Subject:

RTD Bylaws Amendments

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Executive Committee and General Counsel that the Board of Directors approve
the amended Bylaws as outlined and attached through the November 15th Operations and Customer
Service Committee meeting.
BACKGROUND
The proposed amendments to the Bylaws have been reviewed by the Executive Committee and were
presented as an informational item to the last meeting of the Operations and Customer Service
Committee. The amendments address five general areas:
1. “Housekeeping” amendments to correct grammatical errors and obsolete usage, and to provide
direction on typical issues such as how much of the Recommended Action needs to be read out
loud at meetings.
2. Committee meeting and study session guidance. Currently the Bylaws lack written guidance on
how to conduct committee meetings and study sessions. The proposed amendments provide
guidance consistent with current informal practice.
3. Legal compliance. The proposed amendments fix incorrect statutory references and make RTD’s
practice on executive sessions consistent with state law (i.e., requiring a 2/3 vote to go into
executive session).
4. Bylaw amendment threshold. Currently RTD’s Bylaws require only 8 votes for amendments. This
low threshold is inconsistent with Robert’s Rules and general practice in other organizations,
which require a supermajority for Bylaw amendments. The proposed amendments would require a
2/3 supermajority (i.e., 10 votes).
5. Board office staff management. The current Bylaws involve the Board too deeply in determining
merit increases for all Board office staff – and, by implication, performance evaluation and other
supervisory duties. The proposed amendments specify that performance evaluation will be done
according to RTD standard practices, with evaluation of the Executive Manager to the Board to
be assigned to an AGM or higher level employee as determined by the Chair following
consultation with the GM and Executive Committee; and that performance evaluation shall
include soliciting input from all Directors.

Packet Pg. 7

1.B.3

ALTERNATIVES
1. Adopt the proposed amendments to the Bylaws. New Bylaws will be issued with a revised Table
of Contents and in single-spaced format. This is recommended to address the above issues.
2. Adopt some but not all of the proposed amendments to the Bylaws. Amendments to the
recommended action would need to be made at the Committee or Board meeting if such is
desired.
3. Reject the Recommended Action and do not approve the attached Bylaws. This is not
recommended because the Bylaws will continue to contain the errors and issues discussed above.

Date:

From:

Tom Tobiassen, Chair of the Board

GM

Date:

November 11, 2016

Board Meeting Date: November 29, 2016

Subject:

Approval of Updates to the Local and Travel
Policy for the RTD Board of Directors

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Chair of the Board and the Executive Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the amended Local and Travel Policy as outlined and attached through the November 15th
Operations and Customer Service Committee meeting.
BACKGROUND
The proposed amendments to the Local and Travel Expense policy have been reviewed by the Executive
Committee, sent to the full board for 10 days of review and brought as an update to committee on
November 1, 2016. An outline of proposed changes is listed below:
1. “Housekeeping”
a. Amendments to correct grammatical and spelling errors and update the overall formatting
to agency standard
b. Addition of Budget totals and historical Board of Directors Budget Resolutions
c. Restate adherence of Article 29 – 1099 requirement per IRS compensation over $500
2. Clarity of Policy elements
a. Further define allowable and non-reimbursable expenses
b. Define process and timing of submitting expenses
c. Added detail to expense categories
d. Travel Planning and submission of travel plans
e. Clarity of mileage being paid through Local Expense accounts
f. Car Rental requirements
g. Added ground transportation options
h. Updated frequency of BOD statement of expenses to quarterly
3. Update Technology standards, IT support and expenses
a. RTD device and hardware support
b. Updated technology and usage expense for IT reimbursement
c. Elimination of outdated technology support ie. Fax machines, PDA’s etc.
d. Technical home visits by RTD vendors and initial set up budget
4. Non Traditional and “In State” travel
a. Personal vehicle usage defined
b. Train travel

Packet Pg. 95

1.B.4

c. In-state travel guidelines
5. Professional affiliations/Membership subscriptions
a. Correction to incorrect dollar amount verbiage for publications
b. Updated guidelines for higher cost membership subscriptions
c. Organizational membership policy reference
d. Participation in Community non transit related events
ALTERNATIVES
1. Adopt the Recommended Action with proposed amendments to the Board of Director’s Expense
Policy and the updated format. This recommendation addresses updated IRS regulations, clarity
of policy guidelines, and provides definitive language for ease of understanding.
2. Adopt some but not all of the proposed recommendations to the BOD Expense Policy.
Amendments to the policy would be made in committee. Note** Any portion of this policy that
is stated from an approved board Action would need to be brought forward through a new board
action for approval prior to changing in this document.
3. Reject the Recommended Action and do not approve the BOD Expense Policy. This is not
recommended because we will not be compliant to IRS regulations and all errors and lack of
clarity will remain.

where the expected value exceeds $50.00, please offer to pay for your own meal.

allowable under the Internal Revenue Service guidelines, but not to exceed the cost
of air travel to the destination. The cost of the air travel is to be determined by the
Board office staff prior to the date of travel to determine the amount that may be
reimbursed for mileage. The determination is established by example of other
Director’s airfare for the same trip or by research of the lowest fares. All
supporting documentation will be submitted by the Board office staff along with
your expense form.
In the rare instance where a personal vehicle is used on a trip, mileage

Hotels require a personal credit card for the person staying at the hotel for
incidentals. The RTDcompany P-Ccard only covers room and tax, so upon check
in, the Bboard member will need to provide the front desk with their own personal
credit card for miscellaneous expenses. When checking out, please make sure your
personal credit card was not charged for room and tax.
Note* If you utilize a debit or bank card to cover miscellaneous expenses, a hold
may be put on your card in a set amount for the duration of the stay.
The District will reimburse Directors the actual cost of lodging which include room
charges and taxes. All charges other than room charges or taxes appearing on the
hotel bill will be reimbursable subject to the limits established and the submittal of
the itemized receipt. Directors are expected to use sound judgment in the selection
of lodging in keeping with the purpose of the travel so as to minimize the cost to
the District. Lodging or hotel accommodations which were billed to a P-Ccard will
require itemized receipts to match to the actual incurred amount.
When a Director is accompanied by another individual, the District is to be billed
only for the single rate for lodging. The Director must pay for the difference
between single and double rate for the room, if applicable.

4.3. Meals
Directors will be reimbursed for daily personal meals and gratuities with the
submittal of an itemized receipt and documentation that identifies the time, place
and business purpose.
Reimbursement for travel expenses, including meals and gratuities, is allowed on
the first day preceding one day before the start of a conference or one day the last
day following a conference where travel scheduling provisions or same day flight
times are not available or convenient. An example, of this is where a Director
would need to leave Denver on a Saturdayunday to arrive in time for a conference
with a start day of Sunday in Washington D.C., and no flights are available to get
themhim there in time for the Sunday meeting start. Directors will not be
reimbursed for any day that they may choose to go early or stay late for personal
reasons. Directors must provide itemized receipts that provide the time, place and
purpose for the reimbursement request for incurred travel related expenses.
When attending an RTD paid event or conference where meals are provided,
Directors are expected to reduce the number of reimbursed requests for meals by
the number of meals that are provided at the conference. However, if the Director
elects not to eat at the conference or to have a business meetingconference with
meals outside of the paid event, the Director will be reimbursed assuming he can
provide itemized receipts and documentation of the RTD Transit related purpose,

Professional Affiliations/Membership Subscriptions

The Regional Transportation District encourages development of Directors through
active membership in professional organizations.
Although membership in
professional affiliations can be an indirect benefit to RTD as an organization, the
main benefit is the development of the Director, by keeping abreast of trends in
their transportation or technologyprofession, cultivating networks with other
professionals, and developing skills and ideas to become more effective in
theirhis/her position policy making at RTD. Any memberships that are of an
extraordinary cost or require approval will go before the Executive Committee for
approval.
Membership subscriptions in local chambers or approved organizations are
processed through the RTD Public Relations Office. per Management Directive A20. Directors should submit their membership requests through the Board office
who will track and coordinate with the RTD staff responsible for payment.
Organizations must meet the criteria of being transit-related and/or necessary to the
conduct of business and local community involvement. Membership requests that
do not fit this criterion must be approved through the General Manager’s budget.
The Board policy on Organizational Memberships was passed in August of 2011.

For budgeted events only, such as the Board Member/Board Support conference
hosted by the RTD BOD in 2015, the budget document listing allocations for
specific events will serve as the official authorization for the Chair to approve. For
out of state budgeted events only, the “RTD Travel Request and Authorization”
form and the expense report will need to be signed by the Chair of the Board.may
be signed by the Executive Manager to the Board of Directors.
.
Unless there is clearly an apparent benefit to the District, unbudgeted events will
not be approved. If funds for any events have not been approved in the annual
budget, approval must be obtained from the Board. The approval of the Chair is
also required for substitutions for authorized events. A memo explaining reasons
for the request must accompany the travel request form.

where the expected value exceeds $50.00, please offer to pay for your own meal.

If the Director chooses to travel by car or long distance rail vs. air, the Board office
staff will continue to follow the established guidelines to determine the lowest
available flight cost to and from the destination. If use of a personal vehicle is
requested, the Director will be allowed mileage reimbursement up to the maximum
allowable under the Internal Revenue Service guidelines, but not to exceed the cost
of air travel to the destination. The cost of the air travel is to be determined by the
Board office staff prior to the date of travel to determine the amount that may be
reimbursed for mileage. The determination is established by example of other
Director’s airfare for the same trip or by research of the lowest fares. All
supporting documentation will be submitted by the Board office staff along with
your expense form.
In the rare instance where a personal vehicle is used on a trip, mileage
reimbursement and parking/storage costs will not exceed the equivalent discount
airfare between the points involved. Discount fares and “could have” departure
and arrival times must be noted on the Travel Authorization form prior to departure,
if personal obtained for the specific period in question prior to departure and
included as documentation for reimbursement.
4.1.5. Mileage Reimbursement
The RTD Board Office will communicate thefollow the Management Directive No.
A-16, Section 1 which states a per mile allowance equivalent to the maximum
allowable by the Internal Revenue Service. The Board Office verifies with the RTD
Accounts Payable Supervisor the most current rates at the start of each calendar
year.
All local mileage will be paid through the local expense cost code to the Director on
all submitted travel expense formsvehicle operator. Travel round trip to the airport
locally will be included in this expense if agency issued transit passes are unable to
be used. The Board Office will check with the RTD Accounts Payable Supervisor
for the most current rates.
4.2. Lodging (Hotel Accommodations)
The fee for lodging or hotel accommodations at any approved event will be pre-paid
by the Board Office using a P-Card. In the event these fees are not pre-paid, a
copy of the official hotel bill must be provided with the expense report when
claiming reimbursement.
The Board Office will make reasonable arrangements for hotel accommodations in
accordance with acceptable standards for that location incurred at the single
occupancy rate. For APTA conferences, hotel reservations can not be booked until
the attendee is registered for the conference, so if you do not inform the Bboard
staff that you are attending a conference in a timely manner, the conference hotel
may fill up and you will have to stay elsewhere.

Hotels require a personal credit card for the person staying at the hotel for
incidentals. The RTDcompany P-Ccard only covers room and tax, so upon check
in, the Bboard member will need to provide the front desk with their own personal
credit card for miscellaneous expenses. When checking out, please make sure your
personal credit card was not charged for room and tax.
Note* If you utilize a debit or bank card to cover miscellaneous expenses, a hold
may be put on your card in a set amount for the duration of the stay.
The District will reimburse Directors the actual cost of lodging which include room
charges and taxes. All charges other than room charges or taxes appearing on the
hotel bill will be reimbursable subject to the limits established and the submittal of
the itemized receipt. Directors are expected to use sound judgment in the selection
of lodging in keeping with the purpose of the travel so as to minimize the cost to
the District. Lodging or hotel accommodations which were billed to a P-Ccard will
require itemized receipts to match to the actual incurred amount.
When a Director is accompanied by another individual, the District is to be billed
only for the single rate for lodging. The Director must pay for the difference
between single and double rate for the room, if applicable.

4.3. Meals
Directors will be reimbursed for daily personal meals and gratuities with the
submittal of an itemized receipt and documentation that identifies the time, place
and business purpose.
Reimbursement for travel expenses, including meals and gratuities, is allowed on
the first day preceding one day before the start of a conference or one day the last
day following a conference where travel scheduling provisions or same day flight
times are not available or convenient. An example, of this is where a Director
would need to leave Denver on a Saturdayunday to arrive in time for a conference
with a start day of Sunday in Washington D.C., and no flights are available to get
themhim there in time for the Sunday meeting start. Directors will not be
reimbursed for any day that they may choose to go early or stay late for personal
reasons. Directors must provide itemized receipts that provide the time, place and
purpose for the reimbursement request for incurred travel related expenses.
When attending an RTD paid event or conference where meals are provided,
Directors are expected to reduce the number of reimbursed requests for meals by
the number of meals that are provided at the conference. However, if the Director
elects not to eat at the conference or to have a business meetingconference with
meals outside of the paid event, the Director will be reimbursed assuming he can
provide itemized receipts and documentation of the RTD Transit related purpose,

Professional Affiliations/Membership Subscriptions

The Regional Transportation District encourages development of Directors through
active membership in professional organizations.
Although membership in
professional affiliations can be an indirect benefit to RTD as an organization, the
main benefit is the development of the Director, by keeping abreast of trends in
their transportation or technologyprofession, cultivating networks with other
professionals, and developing skills and ideas to become more effective in
theirhis/her position policy making at RTD. Any memberships that are of an
extraordinary cost or require approval will go before the Executive Committee for
approval.
Membership subscriptions in local chambers or approved organizations are
processed through the RTD Public Relations Office. per Management Directive A20. Directors should submit their membership requests through the Board office
who will track and coordinate with the RTD staff responsible for payment.
Organizations must meet the criteria of being transit-related and/or necessary to the
conduct of business and local community involvement. Membership requests that
do not fit this criterion must be approved through the General Manager’s budget.
The Board policy on Organizational Memberships was passed in August of 2011.

For budgeted events only, such as the Board Member/Board Support conference
hosted by the RTD BOD in 2015, the budget document listing allocations for
specific events will serve as the official authorization for the Chair to approve. For
out of state budgeted events only, the “RTD Travel Request and Authorization”
form and the expense report will need to be signed by the Chair of the Board.may
be signed by the Executive Manager to the Board of Directors.
.
Unless there is clearly an apparent benefit to the District, unbudgeted events will
not be approved. If funds for any events have not been approved in the annual
budget, approval must be obtained from the Board. The approval of the Chair is
also required for substitutions for authorized events. A memo explaining reasons
for the request must accompany the travel request form.

RE: Volkswagen and Audi Partial Settlement

To Those Persons Concerned;
The Regional Transportation District (RTD) would like to propose that a significant portion of the
Volkswagen/Audi Partial Settlement funding be allocated to support a State-wide program to fund the
acquisition of electric transit vehicles and related infrastructure/support facilities such as charging
facilities at transit garages. RTD would further propose that, at a minimum, such a program would fund
at least 100% – 110% of the cost differential between a standard diesel powered transit coach and a
battery electric transit bus. RTD estimates the cost of each electric bus at $850,000 and the cost to
install charging stations at RTD garages for recharging the vehicles at approximately $500,000. This
compares to the cost of a standard diesel powered transit bus of approximately $460,000- $495,000.
RTD is currently in the process of receiving 36 new zero emission electric buses for use on the 16th
Street Mall. RTD’s selection of the electric buses for the Mall service was based on a number of proven
benefits of the electric buses to RTD fleet operations and the environment. Should the VW Settlement
funding be made available to fund at least the difference in cost between diesel powered and electric
transit buses, RTD would propose to expand the use of electric vehicles to provide zero emission battery
electric fixed route service in the RTD service area. In the near term, RTD would like to implement an
initial program of 10-15 electric buses in fixed route, scheduled service in the RTD service area. RTD
would select highly visible and high passenger load routes, such as Route 15 serving the Colfax corridor,
or any of a number of local routes in the Boulder local community network for the initial deployment of
electric bus service. The cost of the proposed initial program for RTD would be in the neighborhood of
$6- $6.5 million if incremental costs are funded, to $13 - $13.5 million if the total cost of electric buses is
funded. In addition, RTD has programmed the replacement/acquisition of another 115 transit coaches in
the period 2018- 2020, so the potential investment in transit electrification by RTD could well grow to
exceed these cost numbers in the near future.



Better Energy Efficiency over Conventional Fuels
Electric buses are more fuel efficient than conventional diesel or CNG buses. The electric buses
are also able to regenerate energy during vehicle braking and put it back into the batteries. The
National Renewable Energy Lab in Golden issued an evaluation report in February 2016
concluded that electric buses can be nearly four times more fuel efficient than comparable CNG
buses. RTD ran a demo electric bus on 16th Street Mall for two days and gathered the bus energy
consumption. Based on the data collected, RTD estimated a savings of about $100,000 in fuel
cost over the lifetime of the bus when the electric bus is used to replace the existing CNG bus.



Operational and Maintenance Cost Savings
The use of the electric power system eliminates two major components in the buses, the engine
and the transmission. In addition the electrification of the buses results in simpler and more
reliable electric accessories components, such as air conditioning and power steering. These
lower the operating and maintenance cost. During the review of the electric buses for the Mall
operation, RTD estimated a savings of over $120,000 in maintenance cost per each electric bus
over its lifetime as compared to the cost of RTD’s existing CNG Mall buses.

Environmental Benefits


Pollutant Emissions Reduction
The US Department of Transportation estimates that the transportation sector represents 27%
of total greenhouse gas (CO2) emissions nationally. Diesel buses are one of the major
contributors to that number. DOT estimates each electric bus would be able to eliminate 1,690
tons of CO2 over its 12 year life span. This is equivalent to taking 27 passenger cars off the road.
The electric buses also eliminate 10 tons of NOx and 350 pounds of diesel PM.



Reductions in Operating Cost
Reductions in operating costs attributable to electric buses will help RTD to provide additional
transit service which will serve to reduce single occupant vehicle travel thus further reducing
emissions and generating additional air quality benefits.

Transit Agencies Benefits


RTD proposed electric bus program will provide real world operational data to the industry to
inform transit fleet managers of the operational requirements and issues to allow them to make
better decision on the choice of fuels for future bus purchases.

RTD would like to thank CDPHE for the opportunity to share these comments. We remain committed to
serving the Denver metro area to enhance mobility and improve air quality. Please feel free to contact
us should you wish to discuss any of the issues raised in our comments . We look forward to the
outcome of CDPHE’s deliberations.
