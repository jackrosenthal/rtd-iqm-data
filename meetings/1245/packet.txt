BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: December 4, 2013

From:

Terry L. Howerter, Chief Financial Officer

GM

Date:

December 4, 2013

Board Meeting Date: December 10, 2013

Subject:

Resolution No. _, Series of 2013 Related to the
Issuance of RTD Certificates of Participation

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Reimbursement Resolution”), declaring the intent of
the District to use proceeds from a tax-exempt obligation in the form of a lease purchase agreement
to reimburse itself for certain capital expenditures made in connection with the North Metro rail line
project.
BACKGROUND:
The District is currently in the process of negotiating a contract with Graham, Balfour Beatty, Hamon
Contractors for the design and construction of the North Metro rail line project. The FasTracks
budget anticipates that the North Metro rail line project will be partially financed with lease purchase
obligations (“Certificates of Participation” or “COPs”).
DISCUSSION:
Under a COP structure, RTD leases certain assets and makes rental payments under a lease, subject
to appropriation by the Board of Directors. The COPs are sold to investors and are evidenced by
assignments of proportionate interests in the rights to receive payments under the lease. The leased
assets serve as collateral for the COPs such that, in the event of RTD non-appropriation or default,
the assets may be sold, leased, repossessed, liquidated or otherwise disposed of with proceeds being
utilized to redeem COPs.
With limited exceptions, proceeds from COPs may not be used to reimburse the issuer for expenses
made prior to the execution and delivery of the lease unless the issuer has executed a reimbursement
resolution similar to the attached Reimbursement Resolution. Reimbursement resolutions similar to
this one have been adopted by the Board in the past for bond and COP issuances.
In order to allow the District to finance any expenditures related to the leased assets which may
occur prior to the execution of the financing, the Board is being requested to adopt the
Reimbursement Resolution.
It is currently anticipated that the COPs will be issued in April of 2014. The lease, indenture, official
statement and other pertinent documents will be presented to the Board of Directors for review and
approval prior to the marketing of the COPs.
RTD is receiving the advice of First Southwest Company, as independent financial advisor on the
transaction.

Packet Pg. 49

1.C.1

FINANCIAL IMPACT:
Lease rent and lease interest costs on the COPs are included in the 2014 budget. Costs associated
with the issuance of the securities will be funded out of COP proceeds. These costs include
underwriters’ discount, financial advisory fees, attorneys’ fees, printing costs and the like.
ALTERNATIVES:
1.

Authorize Resolution No. ___, Series of 2013 declaring the intent of the District to use
proceeds from a tax-exempt obligation in the form of a lease purchase agreement to
reimburse itself for certain capital expenditures made in connection with the North Metro
rail line project. This is the recommended action.

2.

Do not authorize Resolution No. ___, Series of 2013 declaring the intent of the District to
use proceeds from a tax-exempt obligation in the form of a lease purchase agreement to
reimburse itself for certain capital expenditures made in connection with the North Metro
rail line project. This is not the recommended action and may disallow the District from
reimbursing itself for any expenses made prior to the close of the transaction.

Date:

December 4, 2013

Board Meeting Date: December 10, 2013

Subject:

Radio-CAD/AVL
Owner’s
Representative
Contract Sixth-Year Amendment

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to amend the
contract with IBI Group (IBI) as the Owner’s Representative to Support Replacement of RTD’s Radio and
Computer Aided Dispatch and Automatic Vehicle Location (CAD/AVL) Systems (Contract 18DH016).
This contract amendment is for the sixth year, which is the final option year of the contract. The scope
and fee are renegotiated annually. The sixth-year fee is not-to-exceed a limit of $2,400,000 for a total
contract value to date of $12,022,000.

BACKGROUND
RTD has been in the process of replacing our radio and CAD/AVL system over the past several years.
RTD formerly operated a 450MHz analog radio communication system that supported voice and data
communications between dispatchers, bus and light rail operators, Transit Police and field support staff
for RTD’s operations. The radio system was integrated with the CAD/AVL system. The system was
initially implemented in 1993 and was past the last years of the industry’s common 15-year service life.
Additionally, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) required changes to the available radio
frequency bandwidth, which were not compatible with the former radio and CAD/AVL design. This
narrow-banding requirement has been met.
The scope of work and fee for this Board-approved contract is negotiated annually to allow the contract
to adjust to changes related to the design choices RTD makes. Although the installations are complete
and the system is operational, there are many remaining efforts required as a foundation for the
extended operations and maintenance of the systems, processes and infrastructure. These and a few
supplemental assignments include general program management, documentation of various elements,
activity planning and administration, establishment of ongoing long-term operations and maintenance
structure, and a variety of system acceptance testing.
RTD requires the services of an Owner’s Representative (OR) for the Radio-CAD/AVL Replacement
Project to provide highly technical, managerial, business services to support the agency through the final
stages of the project and planning for moving into operations. The OR will provide unique technical
skills unavailable internally to RTD.
RTD issued Contract No. 18DH016 to obtain an Owner’s Representative for the Radio-CAD/AVL
Replacement Project. IBI was selected in 2009 by competitive procurement to be RTD’s Owner’s
Representative for the Radio and CAD/AVL Replacement Project. The contract requires eight (8) percent
Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) participation. IBI is currently exceeding their goal.

Packet Pg. 53

1.C.2

This is a complex and dynamic project. IBI has successfully completed the work anticipated for the
earlier years and it is in RTD’s interest to authorize a contract amendment for the sixth year of the
contract to continue needed support.
DISCUSSION
This is the start of the optional sixth year of a Board-approved contract. Due to the complexity and
changing conditions of the project, each year’s scope of work and fee are reviewed and negotiated
annually.
Although implementation for the CAD/AVL project is winding down, significant work remains to conduct
system acceptance testing, review and finalize as-built documentation, develop reporting, and conduct
planning to move into operations and maintenance of the system.
The anticipated sixth-year activities are:








Final system acceptance testing, which will extend well into 2014
Implementation of pending INIT contract amendments, addressing elements such as the HOP and
Call-n-Ride installations and enhancements
Radio system capacity expansion
Testing and implementation of subsequent phases of Smart Media Technology
Disaster Recovery (DR) and Continuation of Operations Plan (CoOP) update and implementation
Study of scheduling tools feeding the CAD system for service optimization and operational
interactions with fleet and resource management
General Intelligent Transportation System / CAD / Communications consultancy demands in
support of RTD operations and FasTrack activities.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The cost to the District for amending the Owner’s Representative contract with IBI Group for the sixth
year is a not-to-exceed cost of $2,400,000. Funding has been included in the 2014 Finance and
Administration Department’s Information Technology Division capital and operating budget. The
contract values for the first five years is cumulatively $9,622,000 and with this 6th year addition total
award is $12,022,000.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Approve the request for the Radio-CAD/AVL Replacement Project Owner’s Representative
contract amendment which will reduce risk and allow current RTD employees to continue
focusing on operating and improving the system. This is the staff recommended action.
2. Attempt to accomplish the project with in-house staff. RTD staff does not have the necessary
skills or available resources to undertake this project.
If the IBI agreement is not approved and these resources are not available, the project would proceed
with a combination of Work Order contractors and RTD staff. It is likely that Alternative 2 will incur
additional cost for another vendor’s learning curve.

Board Meeting Date: December 10, 2013

Subject:

Approval of Sales and Use Tax Compliance
Review Contractor

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorizes the General Manager to approve a two year contract with an additional one year option
with Revenue Recovery Group to provide sales and use tax compliance review services. The
contract will be paid on a labor hour basis with an annual not-to-exceed amount of $607,500.
BACKGROUND
Following the recommendations from staff and the RTD Fiscal Sustainability Committee, the Board of
Directors authorized the General Manager to pursue sales and use tax compliance reviews as a revenue
enhancement initiative. This initiative is also included as a Risk Allocation Matrix item. In September,
RTD completed negotiations and entered an intergovernmental agreement (IGA) with the Colorado
Department of Revenue (DOR) to allow RTD to issue a request for proposals (RFP) for a third party to
provide tax compliance review services to supplement the services currently performed by the DOR.
DISCUSSION
The DOR performs sales and use tax collection and compliance services for RTD’s 1.0% sales and use
tax. The DOR is spending an annual amount of $1.4 million to provide these services for RTD while RTD
is paying the DOR $0.5 million based on a statutory formula. RTD is looking to enhance its partnership
with the DOR to increase sales and use tax revenues through these supplementary compliance services.
Sales and use taxes comprise approximately two thirds of RTD’s annual revenues. Due to RTD’s
reliance on this substantial source of revenue to provide services and to service its debt, it is critical that
tax remittances are accurate and timely. To date, RTD has improved its sales and use tax forecasting by
contracting with the CU Leeds School of Business and has streamlined its tax base through legislation
establishing exemption parity with the state. With the issuance of the tax compliance review services
RFP, RTD is taking a further step towards completing its sales and use tax initiatives.
RTD received three proposals in response to this RFP. The proposal evaluation committee selected
Revenue Recovery Group (RRG) as the firm to be awarded this contract. Proposal selection criteria were
based on best value in providing an understanding of the scope of work, firm experience, personnel
experience and cost.
Services provided will be paid on a labor hour basis with an estimated 4,500 hours of service provided
annually. Potential engagements will be presented to RTD by RRG after a discovery period. RTD will
then approve the engagement, along with DOR’s concurrence, before fieldwork begins.
Each
engagement will be evaluated before approval to proceed is granted. Under the terms of the DOR IGA,
RRG may also perform compliance reviews for state and municipal sales and use taxes during the same
engagement to avoid multiple engagements for a single vendor.

Packet Pg. 56

1.C.3

While RTD expects that, overall, these services will result in additional tax revenues, it is also expected
that some engagements will result in refunds to vendors. A benefit of providing these services is also to
assist and educate vendors with the complexities of tax filing requirements with the primary goal being
to provide assurance that tax filing compliance is met.
In addition to tax compliance reviews, the scope of the services includes providing information and
reporting, to the extent permissible under state confidentiality regulations, to RTD for analysis.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
It is anticipated that the additional sales and use tax revenues recovered will significantly exceed the
cost of this service. The cost of these services has been included in the 2014 Budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the General Manager to approve a two year contract with an additional one year
option with Revenue Recovery Group to provide sales and use tax compliance review
services. The contract will be paid on a labor hour basis with an annual not-to-exceed amount
of $607,500.
2. Further modify the compliance review services contract. This is not recommended because it will
delay the implementation of these services which are constrained by a fixed term under the DOR
IGA.
3. Do not authorize the General Manager to approve a two year contract with an additional one
year option with Revenue Recovery Group to provide sales and use tax compliance review
services. This is not the recommended action because RTD would not have the opportunity
to ensure greater tax compliance and enhance its tax reporting capabilities.

Third Quarter 2013 Performance Report

POLICY REFERENCE
Fiscal Policy Statements – Budget Policy 10
DISCUSSION
Attached is the Performance Report for the Third Quarter 2013. These year-to-date measures
provide a framework in which RTD determines how well it provides service to its passengers and the
citizens of the District. Of the 22 performance measures tracked, RTD met 15 of the goals in their
entirety in the third quarter; one measure (on-time performance) could not be reported in full in Q3.
The following are the exceptions to goals:
Goal 2.1 – The average number of facilities maintenance complaints per month remains above goal in
Q3 but is trending down from Q1 and Q2. Complaints are related primarily to paving and lighting
issues, elevators and shelters. Complaints were highest in Q1 due to issues about snow/ice and
shelter clean-up from snow and several instances where shelters have a one-time per week
maintenance schedule. Complaints declined in Q2 and again in Q3 with an average for the quarter of
14.3.
Goal 3.1 – Due to the transition to the new CAD/AVL system, on-time performance data Q3 is not
yet available for all of Q3 as the data must be compiled manually. We are reporting only Q2 at this
time; we expect full year data will be provided with Q4 data. In Q2, on-time performance was met
in all categories except for First Transit-Commerce City, Veolia, and First Transit-Denver in local ontime bus service. Staff continues to study individual route and driver performance in order to target
remedial actions and resources to the routes experiencing the greatest challenges. As a result of this
activity, on-time performance has shown positive trends over 2012.
Goal 3.3 – RTD as a whole fell slightly short of the 26,000 mileage between lost service road calls
due to shortfalls in the transit bus and articulated bus categories. This is due to the aging of the
fleet and deferral of fleet replacement. As the fleet is replaced in 2013-2014, according to schedule
and per the SBP, this number is expected to improve.
Goal 4.2 – Although initial response to customer complaints was within goal, final resolution of
customer complaints exceeded the goal by 4.8 business days, reflecting the impact of the West Line
and personnel staffing in various areas. This measure reports on resolution of customer complaints
across all subject matter throughout the District and the number includes all departments utilizing the
Trapeze system for commendation and complaint research. We will examine departmental responses
and ways to improve.
Regarding complaints per boardings, we have seen customer complaints increase across the entire
system due to several factors including the fare enforcement campaign, increasing ridership, and

Packet Pg. 68

1.D.2

heavy/longer load times. Top reasons continue to be “bus did not show,” “bus early,” “bus late” and
“operator discourtesy.” Staff continues to review CAD/AVL playbacks to determine the validity of
these complaints and to work with operators to address valid complaints. Staff has provided an
analysis of complaints as part of the Operations/Customer Service report.
Goal 6.2 – RTD did not meet its overall increase in ridership goal in Q3. In the first half of 2012, a
spike in gas prices drove ridership up which created a higher base for the prior year comparison. The
Q3 measure of 1.6% shows improvement over the first half of the year’s negative growth of -0.4%.
Goal 6.3 – RTD did not meet its goal for EcoPass revenue in Q3. Revenue actually declined slightly
in this category due to continued migration from EcoPass to other fare media.
Goal 6.5 – RTD exceeded its vacancies goal in bus mechanics. We are experiencing an unusually
high level of vacancies in this category and recruitment efforts are continuing.

An accident is considered preventable any time the operator was not driving in full compliance with all applicable laws and
regulations and in such a manner as to avoid involvement despite adverse conditions of road, weather or traffic or the errors of
pedestrians or other drivers.
2
It is not unusual for a greater number of accidents to occur during Q1 inclement weather. In addition, the majority of the
accidents were found to be non-preventable. First Transit-Commerce City continues implementation of DriveCam and Smart
Drive technologies to help operations improve driving practices.

On-time is arrival at a location no more than 1 minute early and no more than 5 minutes after the scheduled arrival time.
2
The measure is lowered in 2013 due to system complexity added by the West Line, which will bring with it more single-track
chokepoints on the west end of the line and more crossing points in the CPV. Delays are also coming from signal timing changes
in the downtown district which is affecting performance.
3
Due to the transition to the new CAD/AVL system, the on-time performance data for Q3 is not yet available as it must be compiled
manually. Q2 data is actually being reported here. Year-end data will be provided with the Q4 report.

Reflects the impact of West Line and personnel staffing in various areas. The measure reports on resolution of customer complaints across all
subject matter throughout the District and the number includes all departments utilizing the Trapeze system for commendation and complaint
research.
2
Top complaints are “bus did not show,” “bus early,” “bus late” and “operator discourtesy.” Staff continues to review CAD/AVL playbacks to
determine the validity of these complaints and to work with operators to address valid complaints. Staff provides an analysis of complaints as part
of the Operations/Customer Services report. Customer complaints increased across the entire system due to several factors including the fare
enforcement campaign, the stroller policy, and heavier/longer load times; this higher level of complaints has been consistent for the last 2 years and
is not increasing.
