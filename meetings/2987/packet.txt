BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Paul J. Ballard, Interim General Manager and
CEO

Date: March 24, 2020

From:

Henry
Stopplecamp,
Assistant
Manager, Capital Programs

GM

Date:

March 24, 2020

Subject:

Exercise First Contract Option Year for
Triunity-Hill Joint Venture Contract for
FasTracks Construction Management Support
Consultant Services

General

Board Meeting Date: April 7, 2020

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the Interim General Manager to approve a contract amendment to exercise the
first option year of the Triunity-Hill Joint Venture for Construction Management Support Consultant
Services (CMSC) for FasTracks, extending the contract end date to July 13, 2021, with no increase
in the contract not-to-exceed amount. Funding for the remainder of this contract is included in the
2020 Adopted Budget in the specific projects where CMSC support would be utilized.
This action addresses the following General Manager’s Goals:
Task Goal #5: Increase Ridership.
BACKGROUND
In April 2014, the RTD Board approved selection and award of a multi-year contract to the Triunity-Hill
Joint Venture for an amount not to exceed $15,150,000 for Construction Management Support
Consultant Services. Notice to Proceed was issued on July 15, 2014, for a six-year contract with four
one-year options. In May 2017, the Board authorized an increase the total contract not-to-exceed value,
bringing the not-to-exceed amount of the contract to $34,400,000.
As of March 23, 2020, RTD has contracted for a total of $$31,056,716 in services to be delivered
through the current contract end date of July 13, 2020, with $283,933 of change orders pending
approval, and $3,059,351 remaining of the contract not-to-exceed value. As of the January 2020
invoice, RTD has paid out a total of $28,335,846 on this contract.
The Triunity-Hill JV includes a certified DBE as 51% managing partner. RTD has set a DBE goal of 27%
for this contract. As of march 23, 2020, actual DBE participation has been 43.7% of the contract
value.
DISCUSSION
RTD has reached the stage of the FasTracks program where all of the ongoing corridor projects are in
the closeout phase, or will be entering closeout within the next few months. At this time, it is crucial to
retain the institutional knowledge needed to close out all contracts and meet final reporting requirements
for FTA grant projects. The proposed time extension to the CMSC contract would make the resources
available to RTD to complete the project closeout in a timely and cost-effective manner.

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

In addition, as part of the contract closeout process, RTD faces claims and lawsuits related to its
projects. Support from the CMSC staff that were involved in the original issue could be critical to
resolving the issues in a manner that would be most favorable to RTD.
RTD envisions the CMSC providing continuing support in those areas through July 2021:









Support for North Metro project completion, operations standup, and closeout
Closeout support for the Southeast Rail Extension and Eagle projects
Completion of the Longmont Infrastructure Master Plan
TOD support
Quality management support
DBE support for project closeout
Specialized planning and environmental support
Support for other ongoing projects as needed

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The total Contract Not to Exceed Amount for the CMSC contract would remain at $34,400,000 with
this time extension. All remaining funding for this contract is included in the 2020 Adopted Budget in
the specific projects where CMSC support would be utilized.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the recommended action. It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs &
FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the Interim General Manager to
approve a contract amendment to exercise the first option year of the Triunity-Hill Joint Venture
for Construction Management Support Consultant Services (CMSC) for FasTracks, extending the
contract end date to July 13, 2021, with no increase in the contract not-to-exceed amount.
Funding for the remainder of this contract is included in the 2020 Adopted Budget in the specific
projects where CMSC support would be utilized.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the Interim General Manager to
exercise the contract option. Instead, allow the contract to expire on July 13, 2020, and perform
the remaining work in-house with RTD staff. This is not recommended because RTD does not
have in-house staff with the institutional knowledge, background, and technical skills of the
specific staff to be retained through this time extension, and would not be able to replace their
expertise in a timely and cost-effective manner.

Authorization for Intergovernmental Agreement
(IGA) with the City of Boulder for the Transfer
of Used RTD Site Amenities

General

Board Meeting Date: April 7, 2020

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the Interim General Manager and CEO, or designee, to execute all documents
necessary to enter into an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with the City of Boulder, for the transfer
of ownership of 3 bus shelters, 4 benches, 6 trash receptacles, and 4 bike racks. Minor adjustments to
these quantities may be made if the project scope changes.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s goals:
Core Goal #5 - Effective Communications & Community Outreach
BACKGROUND
RTD currently has 9,702 bus stops, of which 330 are RTD-maintained. Adding amenities such as
shelters, benches, and trash cans provides a more comfortable environment to RTD patrons to wait, but
comes with initial capital and ongoing maintenance costs. RTD’s maintenance costs for a stop with
amenities are approximately $4,600-$5,600 each year. Several bus stops are maintained by local
agencies or by advertisers.
The City of Boulder is reconstructing Broadway on the north end of the City from Violet Ave. to US36.
There are currently six bus stops within the project area. All bus stops will be rebuilt as part of the
project. The City of Boulder would like to include site amenities at the bus stops for RTD patrons and is
seeking RTD’s assistance in providing these site amenities. RTD currently has the requested site
amenities in its salvage yard that could be transferred to the City for use on the project. The City has
agreed to take ownership of the amenities and to provide all ongoing maintenance at the stops within
the project area.
DISCUSSION
The City of Boulder has requested that RTD transfer ownership of 3 bus shelters, 4 benches, 6 trash
receptacles, and 4 bike racks. The City will take on ownership of the amenities and be responsible for all
future maintenance at the bus stops within the project area.
RTD currently has no shelters at the stops within the project area, and other amenities are also limited.
All southbound stops have a high number of boardings, and northbound stops have a high number of
alightings.
The proposed IGA includes provisions for transferring site amenities for 6 locations along Broadway St.
in the City of Boulder 1) Violet Ave. NB, (2) Yarmouth Ave. NB, (3) Lee Hill Dr. NB, (4) Lee Hill Dr. SB,
(5) Yarmouth Ave. SB, and (6) Violet Ave. SB. Key provisions of the IGA include the following:

Packet Pg. 6

1.B.2





RTD design/construction review and approval of bus stops
Maintenance responsibilities at bus stops
Transfer of ownership of shelters, benches, trash receptacles, and bike racks

The proposed IGA includes provisions that RTD will not be held responsible for any claims or liabilities
that result from Boulder’s actions or omissions.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
RTD will not provide any funding towards the construction or maintenance of the project.
The transferred amenities are currently in storage and have an estimated value of $28,560.
There would be no impact to RTD maintenance costs because RTD currently does not provide any
maintenance at the stops within the project area, and the City of Boulder will be responsible for all future
bus-stop maintenance.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs &
FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the Interim General Manager and
CEO or designee to execute all documents necessary to enter into an Intergovernmental
Agreement (IGA) with the City of Boulder, for the transfer of ownership of 3 bus shelters, 4
benches, 6 trash receptacles, and 4 bike racks. Minor adjustments to these quantities may be
made if the project scope changes.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action and do not enter into an IGA. This would result in
leaving several high-use, project-area bus stops without site amenities for our patrons, when a
reasonable mechanism to enable addition of the amenities is being proposed.

What is a System Optimization Plan (SOP)?
The SOP is a process that seeks to understand the community’s
transit goals and priorities and ultimately develops a
recommended service plan that balances them. Priorities
identified are expected to help guide transit investment in the
short- and mid-term.
After implementation of the SOP in 2021, the SOP will be
evaluated and adjusted three times per year as part of the normal
run board process by RTD staff to ensure that it continues to meet
the ever-changing needs of the region.

DEVELOPING THE MOBILITY OF THE FUTURE

A similar core network of existing routes is included in each of
the four scenarios (defined on slide 13). These core network
routes are already optimized; they operate efficiently, carry a
high volume of riders, and serve key regional destinations.
Examples of core network routes include the Flatiron Flyer,
Broadway and Colfax routes. The core network accounts for
59% of the existing RTD system.
For each of the four scenarios, we will build upon the core
network to identify effective ways to provide service to key
areas of the District that reflect the goal of each scenario.

Four SOP Scenarios for Evaluation

DEVELOPING THE MOBILITY OF THE FUTURE

The Reimagine RTD team is currently developing four alternative RTD
transit system scenarios. The themes of the four scenarios were
developed by the project’s Technical Working Group and Advisory
Committee as well as RTD’s Citizen’s Advisory Committee and have been
reviewed with the RTD Board.
The evaluation of the four alternative scenarios is intended help the
committees and the RTD Board balance investment of limited transit
resources to best meet both the District’s regional mobility needs, and the
unique mobility needs of the District’s subregions. The evaluation of
scenarios and input from committees will be used to support
development of the recommended SOP.

Transit Recommendations
• Connect areas of high population and
employment densities that have high transit
propensities to activity centers
• Identify opportunities to expand high
frequency transit network
• Identify productive regional one-seat rides
for competitive transit travel times

Scenario 2: RTD Service Productivity
(previously called Cost Efficiency)

Definition: Focus resources on travel markets and patterns to achieve the highest potential
ridership per service hour
Key Metrics:
• Cost per Boarding
• Boardings per Service Hour
Scenario Objectives:
• Identify potential route efficiencies in the Service Quality network
• Allocate resources to areas most likely to generate high ridership

Scenario 2: RTD Service Productivity
Approach:
• Start with Service Quality network and
identify potential turn backs, service
restructuring to a feeder network, and
possibly service frequency
adjustments
• With resources saved, identify and
prioritize improvements that are likely
to be cost-effective (i.e., largest
potential ridership return for
investment) and put into this network

Example Application
Areas exhibiting high transit
propensity characteristics
are where there is an expectation
for higher ridership return on
investment
Note: Areas identified with a high transit propensity
exhibit high proportions of low income and zero car
households, minority, student and senior populations

Definition: Focus resources in a manner that emphasizes transit service to equity-focused
populations and zero-car households
Key Metrics:
• % of Transit Dependent Population served
• % of Transit Dependent Population served • 15-minute service
Scenario Objectives:
• Focus service on identified high density equity areas
• Concentrate on service that best addresses observed travel patterns
• Round out coverage to remaining equity neighborhoods as resources available, using
combination of fixed routes and flex zones
