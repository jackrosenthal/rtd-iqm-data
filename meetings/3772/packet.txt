March 12, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
March 25, 2025

Added to Committee Agenda as a Director initiated request pursuant to RTD Board Bylaws Art. V,
Section 3(b). Requires formal motion and second at Committee meeting.
MOTION
For the Board of Directors to provide policy guidance regarding the development and periodic revision of
service standards and service performance reporting.
BOARD REPRESENTATIVES
JoyAnn Ruscha, Director, District B
Ian Harwick, Director, District L
Brett Paglieri, Director, District M
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
Service Standards
Service standards are criteria used to define the qualities, characteristics, and service levels provided by
a public transit agency. Such standards include a wide range of elements such as reliability, frequency,
loading, geometric design, stop spacing, coverage, accessibility, land use, supplemental service, and
overall customer experience while using transit. These standards are used to measure service
performance, to guide decision-making when planning and delivering services, and to determine resource
needs.
RTD routinely monitors and adjusts service delivery to accommodate the transit needs of customers and
jurisdictions within the agency’s service area. The agency adheres to and periodically updates service
standards to maintain consistency in the evaluation of existing services and modifications thereto based
on system performance and utilization, with a lens toward maintaining service equity; to examine
opportunities for new service offerings; and to ensure that the services delivered represent the most
cost-effective use of the agency’s resources in fulfilling RTD’s mission of making lives better through
connections.
RTD’s inaugural service standards, which provided a rational, equitable, and sustainable approach to
developing and evaluating service delivery, were originally adopted in 1987 and have been revised
periodically over the intervening years. The Board most recently approved the agency’s service standards

Packet Pg. 36

15.A

in 2016, which also stipulated that standards will be revised and approved every two years thereafter. A
subsequent refresh of the service standards was postponed due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic
in 2020. As staffing resources continue to grow, boardings continue to rebound over time, and service
is adjusted to meet the needs of the customers and communities served, the Board and staff anticipate
the need to resume a collective discussion surrounding the revision and adoption of service standards in
2026 and on a routine basis thereafter.
Comprehensive Operational Analysis/System Optimization Plan
RTD’s current Comprehensive Operational Analysis (COA), branded as the System Optimization Plan or
SOP, is a detailed evaluation of travel patterns, demographics, and transit routes in within RTD’s service
area and includes recommended modifications to the agency’s fixed-route services to better meet the
region’s near-term mobility needs within existing workforce and financial constraints. It is best practice
in the transit industry to use a COA to inform service standards.
The SOP was developed over the course of two years and followed a five-step process to inform
decisions and recommendations, including a comprehensive assessment of existing services, review of
current travel patterns and financial capacity, identification and discussion of goals and values, and
iterative drafting of recommended network improvements. The SOP, formally adopted by the RTD Board
of Directors in July 2022, will be gradually implemented through 2026 through RTD’s standard service
change process.
DISCUSSION
In adopting this Recommended Action, the Board establishes, in alignment with the 2021-2026 Strategic
Plan, that:
•

•

•

No later than July 2025:
o Staff will provide a report to the Operations, Safety, and Security Committee related
outlining the current standards along with service performance data related to the
standards and will publish this information in an easily accessible location on the agency’s
website.
o The Board will review, ratify, and reaffirm the current service standards, most recently
approved by the Board in July 2016, and any administrative or ministerial changes that
have been made to the standards since 2016.
Staff will refresh, and the Board will consider, service standards at least triennially commencing in
July 2026 to coincide with the development of Comprehensive Operational Analyses on a
triennial or more frequent basis, as necessary to meet the needs of the agency.
Continuing in 2026 and in following years, staff will report to the Board on an annual basis, no
later than July each year, service performance data related to the service standards and will
publish this information and any updates thereto in an easily accessible location on the agency’s
website.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with the adoption of Board policy guidance regarding service
standards. Funding to triennially perform COAs and to develop service standards related thereto will be
derived from the annual budgets for the year such COAs and standards are adopted.

15.A.c

1.1 Overview
RTD continually receives requests for changes to existing service and for new service in
growing areas of the District. Additionally, RTD may be operating some services that are
not attracting enough riders to justify their cost. In order to be consistent in the
evaluation of service proposals, and to ensure that the service being provided represents
the most cost-effective use of the District's resources, a set of service standards is
maintained by RTD.
The specific standards, targets or minimum/maximum values for the standards, and a
procedure for applying these standards, are presented in this document. Since service
standards are intended to optimize usage of the District's resources, they are updated
periodically to reflect changes in the District goals and resources. The procedure for
updating the standards is described in Section 1.3.

1.2 Application of Service Standards
There are two primary applications for the ongoing use of the service standards. These
are the use of standards to evaluate existing services, and use of standards to evaluate
proposals for new service.
The application of standards to existing routes is a flexible process. The purpose of the
standards is to help identify routes which are most in need of service changes, such as
restructuring to eliminate lower productivity segments or branches, adjusting service
frequency to better reflect the demand for service, or providing additional promotion of
less patronized routes where appropriate. Routes, which do not meet standards, are not
automatically designated for elimination. Elimination of routes is only intended as a last
resort, when it has been determined that no cost-effective actions are available to improve
the productivity of the route.
The standards for evaluation of existing routes are not intended to preclude changes to
routes that meet these minimum standards. In many cases, it may be possible to improve
the productivity of routes that meet the minimum standards by making changes to
headways or trip times. Since the overall mission of RTD is “To meet our constituents’
present and future public transit needs by offering safe, clean, reliable, courteous,
accessible and cost-effective service throughout the District,” these standards should not
be used to prevent changes to improve the efficiency of existing routes, as long as the
changes meet the route design standards.
The availability of financial resources, represented by the annual budget, is the bottom line
for these standards. Service expansion may occur when additional funds are available and
contraction may occur otherwise. In any case, selection of which services to provide or
curtail is based on these performance standards and no service is considered guaranteed

1. Introduction

Service Development Policies & Standards

15.A.c

The evaluation of new service proposals will take place as proposals are received or needs
identified. The most recent values of the standards for existing routes will be used to
evaluate the proposed new services. Decisions regarding implementation of new routes
will be made through the service planning process. New routes and services will be
expected to meet all applicable design standards described in Sections 2, 3 and 54, but
will not be expected to meet the productivity standards described in Section 2.3.2.1 until
they have been in operation for at least six months. Demonstration, experimental, and
cost sharing services are also handled in this manner.

1.3 Updating of Service Standards
The service standards are intended to support the goals and objectives of the District.
Since these objectives and the resources available to attain them can be expected to
change over time, the standards will be revised periodically to reflect those changes.
The service standards will be reviewed on a bi-annual basis. At that time, experience
with the service standards over the previous time period, as well as changes in the
District's goals and objectives, will be used to determine whether any standards should be
added or revised.
The numerical values of productivity standards will be updated each year, using ridership,
revenue and cost figures for the most recent twelve-month period for which data are
available. The rankings are based only on those routes that existed for the entire year.
Routes which were eliminated during the year will not be included because they cannot be
identified as candidates for revisions. Routes that were introduced during the year will not
be included in determining the new standards since they are not required to meet the
productivity standards until they have been in operation for at least six months. However,
these routes will be evaluated separately, using the service standards contained in this
document.
The updating procedure will compare the values of the productivity standards with those
in effect for the previous year. Operating cost data for the previous year will be revised to
account for system-wide increases or decreases in operating cost.

2. Performance Standards
2.1

Derivation and Use of Standards

The productivity standards are used to identify routes and services for appropriate
marketing and possible revision or elimination. Separate standards are identified for each
class of service. Routes are evaluated on ridership (either boardings per in-service hour or
per trip, depending on the class of service) and on the economic measure of subsidy per
passenger. These standards are based on the performance of the least productive 10
percent of the routes in each service class for either the ridership or economic measure, or

Packet Pg. 54

Attachment: Approved Service Standards_7-2016 (5089 : Service Planning Standards and Service Performance Reporting)

or beyond review. The RTD Board of Directors, with input from RTD staff and the public,
is responsible for making decisions on service recommendations.

Service Development Policies & Standards

on the least productive 25 percent of routes in both measures. The basis for the
standards will be reviewed in conjunction with the cost recovery standards in Section 9,
and may be revised if necessary.
New services should meet the applicable standards for their class of service after six
months of operation. All new services will be reviewed after six months of operation and
routes that have not shown adequate progress toward meeting the standards will be
targeted for cost-effective actions to increase productivity or for elimination.

To meet the RTD mission to provide cost-effective service throughout the District, RTD
has developed different types or classes of service that serve specific markets and,
therefore, have different performance expectations. Due to their different service
characteristics Express, Regional and SkyRide were treated as separate classes. However,
due to the deployment of rail, BRT and resulting service restructuring, these classes are
reconfigured. The routes in these three are reassigned into a new, consolidated Regional
class or the Local CBD class. Regional class includes routes providing high-speed service
on limited access highways from suburban and outlying communities to downtown
Denver, Denver International Airport and other metro, major employment centers, and
provided at distances of approximately 6 miles or more. Local services have three subclassifications: CBD—any route serving downtown Denver; Urban—35% or more of route
length within a ¼ mile buffer has population+employment density of 12 per acre or
greater; and Suburban—34% or less. Call-n-Ride and Access-a-Ride are separate classes.
Enhanced bus and BRT routes may warrant future consideration regarding their operation
with: dedicated right-of-way; partially dedicated ROW; limited or express mode; priority
over other traffic; and various speeds appropriate to context. [Please see attachment A
Service Classes for details on how these revisions affect current routes.]
The standards for evaluating portions of routes are intended for use in identifying needed
service improvements, for making modifications to specific portions of existing routes, or
for identifying low productivity segments of routes.
These standards could be used in situations such as isolating low productivity portions of
otherwise productive routes or measuring options for bringing unproductive routes into
compliance with the overall service standards. These standards may also be used to
evaluate proposals for new route extensions or deviations on existing routes.

2.2 Ridership and Economic Measures
The RTD’s approach is to develop a family of transit services suited to a variety of travel
markets. All services are designed to match the level of service with demand, thus
improving performance and sustainability. This results in multiple domains of acceptable
performance for the various classes of service. Standards are best set by first determining
measures of performance and objectives. The core objective is to maximize overall
ridership, to the extent allowed by the available resources.

Service Development Policies & Standards

Service allocation is driven by the RTD adopted mission statement: “To meet our
constituents’ present and future public transit needs by offering safe, clean, reliable,
courteous, accessible cost-effective service throughout the District.”
Performance Measures
• Passengers/hour (productivity)
• Passengers/trip (Regional class productivity)
• Subsidy/passenger (cost effectiveness)
The subsidy per passenger measure
combines fare revenue and total cost
impacts to produce a measure that
comprehensively reflects the District’s
allocation of resources. The effectivenessproductivity chart, Figure 1 - Effectiveness Productivity Chart, presents economic
effectiveness on the vertical axis, and
productivity, or boardings per hour, on the
horizontal axis.
The chart offers a
convenient comparative analysis of all
classes of services, illustrating both
absolute and relative performance. When
standards and guidelines are applied, Figure 1 Effectiveness - Productivity Chart
judgments can be made.

2.3 Fixed Route Service Design and Evaluation Standards
2.3.1 Minimum Service Frequency
New routes shall provide the minimum frequencies specified below. Existing services that
cannot meet these minimum standards while adhering to the minimum passengers per
hour or trip standards defined in Section 2.3.2 shall be identified as candidates for service
changes or appropriate marketing promotion within available resources. These service
changes may include providing service with longer headways if no other viable alternative
exists. Elimination of the route may be considered if service changes and/or promotional
efforts do not improve productivity.
These are “policy” service levels and represent a compromise between economic
efficiency and the functionality of the system. To be sustained at these levels, a route
must meet the minimum ridership performance standards discussed in Section 2.3.2.1 and
annual calculated standards. Routes providing frequencies higher than the policy minimum
must be justified by ridership demand as outlined in Section 2.3.4.
The following table indicates the minimum frequency standard for types of service and
time of day by corridor (multiple routes sharing a segment).

2.3.2 Minimum Ridership Performance
This standard applies to routes operating at the minimum service frequency target. For
Local and Limited routes, the standard is passengers per hour based upon the bottom 10%
and 25% of routes in the respective class. For Regional, and SkyRide routes, the standard
is passengers per trip.
These standards are derived from system averages by class of service. All routes must
meet their applicable minimum standards. Those that do not meet these standards will
need to be modified or marketed in some way in order to bring them up to the minimum
standards. Those that are not brought up to the minimum standards are subject to
cancellation. Routes that meet their applicable minimum ridership standards justify a
service level at the minimum service frequencies outlined in Section 2.3.1. Higher
frequencies must be justified by ridership as outlined in Section 2.3.4.
2.3.2.1

Performance Standards

These measures and the effectiveness-productivity for all routes and services and the class

Maximum Load (Crowding) Standard

From the Transit Capacity and Quality of Service Manual: “From the passenger
perspective, the passenger load on a transit vehicle affects the comfort of the on-board
vehicle portion of a transit trip-both in terms of being able to find a seat and in overall
crowding levels within the vehicle. From a transit operator's perspective, a poor quality of
service may indicate the need to increase service frequency or vehicle size to reduce
crowding and increase passenger comfort.”
RTD defines crowding as a seated load plus the standing passenger space, as calculated
for each vehicle by subtracting the area occupied by seats and other objects from the
gross interior floor area. The amount of crowding on a route is defined as the percent of
total trips during a defined time period that exceed a comfort passenger level of 4.3—5.3
square feet per standee, generally having these characteristics (See page 5-24 of the
Transit Capacity and Quality of Service Manual, 3rd Edition,
http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/tcrp/tcrp_rpt_165ch-05.pdf):
• Standing load without body contact
• Standees have similar amount of personal space as seated passengers
• Reasonably easy circulation within vehicle
The maximum number of standees can be computed for each vehicle by determining its
standing passenger square footage and dividing by 4.3—5.3. For any service class during
any defined period (e.g., AM early, AM peak, midday), when 10% or more of the
directional trips exceed the computed maximum standees at the maximum load point,
further investigation of potential remedies, such as changing the bus assignment or
frequency of service, is warranted. For special events heavier loads are expected and
acceptable, but when 10% or more of trips during the take-away have 4 or less square
feet per standing passenger, further investigation of potential remedies is warranted. See
Attachment D Crowding Report Examples for reference. The Percent of Total Trips chart
(lower right) with level-of-service D or E would indicate crowding.

Service frequency in the RTD network is based on clock-pattern schedules. This pattern
provides consistent and easy to understand schedules for our customers, and makes
possible the provision of timed transfer connection hubs, whereby multiple routes are
scheduled to meet at one location to facilitate connections. In general, routes are
scheduled to operate in even increments of 30 minutes, or every 60, 30, 15, 10, 7.5, or 5
minutes. However, other frequencies may be provided depending upon passenger
demand, or operational and scheduling needs.
For routes meeting the above frequency, ridership, and load standards, frequency better
than every 30 minutes may be provided when and where justified by ridership. This
standard applies equally to all service categories. In order to be sustainable, higher
frequency service must meet the following criteria:
•
•
•
•
•

Incremental frequency necessary to maintain the appropriate load standard during any
30 minute time period.
Appropriate vehicle assignment as outlined in Section 2.3.5
When a service exceeds the maximum load standard, higher frequency may be justified
during that time period and/or route segment.
If a service with better than the minimum frequency has passenger loads that can be
accommodated with a lower frequency without violating the load standard, then
frequency may be reduced.
As a general guideline, a typical productivity by service frequency, for a whole route or

• branches or end segments
The governing standards for overall route productivity were presented earlier. Since trips
provided during marginally productive hours of the day or trips over marginal segments
often increase the attractiveness of the overall service, an otherwise productive route may
be able to support some less productive trips or portions of the route. However, if a route
cannot meet the overall service standards for its class of service, there may not be
productive segments to enhance the unproductive segments. Therefore, specific
segments, branches, or trips which meet the standards for portions of routes may still be
modified in order to raise the productivity of the entire route, if the overall route does not
meet the service standards for its class of service.
2.3.6.1 Midline Segments and Midline Deviations
•
•
•

A midline segment or deviation of a Local or Limited route should generate enough
boardings per hour of service provided to meet the standard for its class of service
(CBD, Urban and Suburban). Boardings in both directions will be counted.
If a route is changed, the change shall not cause a reduction in the overall boardings
per hour for the route.
If a route is changed, the change shall not cause the route to violate any route design
standards as defined in Section 2.3, or the overall productivity standards as defined in
Section 2.

2.3.6.2 Branches and End Segments
•
•
•

•

•

A branch or end segment of a Local or Limited route should generate enough boardings
to meet the ridership standard for its class of service (CBD, Urban and Suburban).
Boardings generated along the branch are defined as all passengers boarding the bus
along the branch or end portion of the route, and all outbound passengers alighting
along this section.
Local collector portions of Regional routes which meet the following maximum travel
time standard shall meet the ridership productivity standard for the entire route. This
maximum travel time is equal to 15 minutes or 50 percent of line haul travel time,
whichever is less.
For shorter segments, the minimum ridership standard is reduced by the ratio of actual
travel time to the maximum allowable travel time. Thus, if the actual travel time along
the collector is half of the maximum allowed, it must average half the number of
boardings per trip specified in the minimum ridership productivity standard.
A new extension to a route that does not meet the minimum ridership productivity
standard must attract sufficient ridership for the entire route to meet the minimum
ridership standard for its service class.

2.3.6 Design and Evaluation of Portions of Routes

Service Development Policies & Standards

A route extension will not be initiated if it violates any of the route design standards
found in Section 2.3, or causes the route as a whole to fall below the minimum riders
per unit of service or standards found earlier in Section 2.3.2.

2.4 Demand Response Service Design and Evaluation Standards
RTD continues to develop a family of transit services suited to a variety of travel markets.
The goal of this approach is to match the type and level of service to the demand in a
given service area, thus improving performance and sustainability. As such, a variety of
non-fixed route services are provided by the RTD including the following.
2.4.1 Call-n-Ride
Rather than operating on a fixed route and schedule, demand responsive Call-n-Ride
service is characterized as a shared ride within a defined geographic service area and the
need for the passenger to arrange for pick-up in advance or be at a designated checkpoint
at prescheduled times. A Call-n-Ride service area averages about 7 square miles or
between about 2 to 30 square miles depending on its number of vehicles and service
configuration—predominantly station feeder or community-based service. Call-n-Ride often
provides first/last mile access to the broader RTD network of services through timed
connections at transfer centers and Park-n-Rides. Population plus employment is 3 to 12
persons per acre. Call-n-Ride service is evaluated based on passenger boardings per
revenue hour and subsidy per passenger boarding.
2.4.2 Access-A-Ride
Access-a-Ride provides ADA complementary paratransit in the District to individuals who
cannot readily access the bus and rail system. As per US DOT requirements the
passenger’s trip origin and destination must be within ¾ mile of RTD’s non-commuter bus
route system, during the same days and hours of their operation and within the District
boundaries, and curb-to-curb service must be provided. However, RTD provides door-todoor service as a reasonable accommodation. Trips must be booked at least one day and
up to 3 days in advance; however, RTD also offers subscriptions.
All applicants must qualify for certification under the guidelines established by the
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, complete a functional evaluation in person,
provide a physician’s statements to verify disability and must meet one of the following
criteria:
• Be unable to get to and from a bus stop or on and off a lift-equipped bus by yourself
• Have a cognitive disability that prohibits your understanding of how to complete bus
trips
2.4.3 Vanpooling
Vanpooling is a public transportation option in which commuters, whose residences are
geographically clustered, ride together to and from their work sites in a van that is driven
by one of the vanpool participants. Typically vanpools make one roundtrip per day and

Service Development Policies & Standards

carry from 5 to 14 riders. Vanpooling offers greater opportunities for increased capacity
compared to carpooling and offers a cost-effective alternative to conventional transit in
areas of low employment density and longer commute distances. RTD contracts for this
service with DRCOG to subsidize the portion of the commute trip within the District.
Vanpool service is evaluated based on subsidy per passenger boarding.
2.4.4 SeniorRide and Senior Shopper
SeniorRide Special Events transports groups to a variety of cultural, educational and
entertainment events. The Schedule of events is published 3 times a year to the public.
Service is available on a first come first served basis. A minimum of 10 passengers per
trip is required. Scheduled events that do not generate reservations of at least 2 groups of
10 may be reconsidered as to whether or not to schedule such event(s) during the next 12
months.
SeniorShopper buses have established routes that provide trips to major grocery stores.
Service is available Monday through Friday. A minimum of 10 passengers per trip is
required.

2.5 Reliability
On-time for fixed-route service is defined as not more than 1 minute early to not more than
5 minutes late. RTD sets annual objectives for on-time performance by class of service
and which are reported in the Quarterly Performance Report. [Improved methods for
monitoring, identifying the causes and remedying unreliable service are currently in
development.]

3. Geometric Design Standards
3.1 Directness of Route
Routes shall be designed to be as direct as possible and to provide maximum accessibility
to transit.
• Deviations from a direct path from end-to-end of the route shall account for no more
than one-quarter of the end-to-end travel time of the route.
•

For a specific deviation, the total additional travel time for all through passengers
should not exceed three minutes for each rider boarding or alighting along the
deviation.
In mathematical terms, this means that the quantity
Pt * VTT < 3 minutes
Pd
where: Pt = through passengers
VTT = additional vehicle one-way travel time
Pd = passengers served by deviation

Bus routes shall adhere to the following stop spacing standards. Placement also
considers: the balance between pedestrian access and route travel time; ADA
requirements; adjacent land uses; streetscape conditions and property ownership.

•

Local and Regional collection, residential areas - 600'
(8 stops/mile) Commercial areas - 500' (10 stops/mile)

Local service, residential and commercial areas – 1,250’ (4 stops/mile)
Limited service, residential and commercial areas – 1,250’ (4 stops/mile)
Limited service, limited stop zone – 8,000’ (1 stop/1.5 miles)

3.3 Roadway Design Goal
New bus routes should not be operated along streets that do not meet minimum
standards, such as for bus turning radius, pavement strength/loading, lane width, roadway
grade, shoulder width on rural roads (for pedestrian waiting and safety) and overhead
clearance. Refer to the RTD Bus Infrastructure Design Guidelines and Criteria Section 1 –
Transit Access for specific details.

4. Shelters
The minimum warrant for the placement of a shelter is 40 boardings per day at the stop.
Stops with the highest average of daily boardings will take top priority for shelter
placement. [Revised standards are currently in development and will reference the RTD
Bus Infrastructure Design Guidelines and Criteria.]

5. Area Coverage Standards
5.1 Purpose and Application
The purpose of these standards is to define a reasonable level of service to all areas of the
District and to help RTD maintain this service level. Since the RTD service area includes
many different types of development, and population densities and land use vary widely
across the District, it would not be reasonable to expect all areas to support the same level
of service. Moreover, different types of service may best meet the needs of different
areas, and RTD's resources can be used in a more productive fashion if service can be
tailored to the needs of particular areas. Area coverage standards provide guidelines for
tailoring service to the needs of communities and help ensure that all areas receive a level
of service that is commensurate with their needs.

3.2 Stop Spacing Standards

Service Development Policies & Standards

Levels of service for specific areas also depend on the productivity of existing services. If
existing or proposed services cannot meet the productivity standards outlined in Section 2,
RTD may choose not to provide the minimum level of service. Financial constraints may
also limit RTD's ability to meet the area coverage (or any other) standards.

5.2 Coverage Levels Outside the Denver CBD
The area coverage standards for areas outside the Denver Central Business District (CBD)
are based on a combined density measure. This measure adds population and employment
to determine potential demand for transportation to and from a particular area.
[Attachment B shows the density classifications overlaid with RTD services for the entire
District.]
The area coverage standards presented below deal with route spacing. Actual route
spacing and service frequency will depend on demand and productivity of existing service
in the area.
For use in this document, arterial roadways are defined as follows:
• Traffic flow controlled by traffic signals as opposed to stop signs
• Carry longer distance traffic flow
• Speed limit 30 mph or faster
• Road width two plus lanes in each direction
5.2.1 Minimum Service Levels
Areas with 3-12 residents and employees per acre
• Peak period Park-n-Ride service if either the travel time to the Denver CBD by Express
bus or rail, or a bus/rail timed connection, exceeds 20 minutes.
• Call-n-Ride service.
Areas with 12 or more residents and employees per acre:
• Local service on major arterials with pedestrian access within 1/4 mile.
• Peak period, Limited, Express, or Regional service from Park-n-Rides if either the travel
time to the Denver CBD by bus, or a bus/rail timed connection, exceeds 20 minutes.
5.2.2 Access-A-Ride - ADA Required Service Area Coverage

(i) The entity shall provide complementary paratransit service to origins and
destinations within corridors with a width of three-fourths of a mile on each side of
each fixed route. The corridor shall include an area with a three-fourths of a mile
radius at the ends of each fixed route.
(ii) Within the core service area, the entity also shall provide service to small areas
not inside any of the corridors but which are surrounded by corridors.

(iii) Outside the core service area, the entity may designate corridors with widths
from three-fourths of a mile up to one and one half miles on each side of a fixed
route, based on local circumstances.
(iv) For purposes of this paragraph, the core service area is that area in which
corridors with a width of three-fourths of a mile on each side of each fixed route
merge together such that, with few and small exceptions, all origins and
destinations within the area would be served.
“(2) Rail.
(i) For rail systems, the service area shall consist of a circle with a radius of 3/4 of
a mile around each station.
(ii) At end stations and other stations in outlying areas, the entity may designate
circles with radii of up to 11/2 miles as part of its service area, based on local
circumstances.
“(3) Jurisdictional boundaries. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
paragraph, an entity is not required to provide paratransit service in an area outside
the boundaries of the jurisdiction(s) in which it operates, if the entity does not have
legal authority to operate in that area. The entity shall take all practicable steps to
provide paratransit service to any part of its service area.”
“Requirements for complementary paratransit do not apply to commuter bus …
fixed route bus service, characterized by service predominantly in one direction
during peak periods, limited stops, use of multi-ride tickets, and routes of extended
length, usually between the central business district and outlying suburbs.”

6. Transit Access
RTD has guidelines for access to its facilities for pedestrians, bus riders, bicyclists,
passenger loading, and parking. The RTD Bus Infrastructure Design Guidelines and
Criteria, included here by reference, is intended to be used by RTD in conjunction with
local jurisdictions in planning transit access (including projects under construction).

7. Service Guidelines for Special Events and Special Services
7.1 Derivation of Standards
The following guidelines for provision of bus and/or train service to special events are
based on prior RTD Board actions and on the public convenience and necessity to:
•
•
•

Protect neighborhoods from the impact of events which are so large as to overwhelm
the surrounding supply of parking, and
Serve customers by offering adequate service for events which are predictably large
enough to overload the normally available transit service, and
Protect taxpayers by only serving those events that have a predictable level of transit
demand great enough to justify the operation of special routes.

Standards for Events

RTD, within the limits of its budget, will operate special service:
•
•
•

For events at Invesco Field at Mile High stadium with projected attendance of over
55,000, for which the crowd is expected to all be present at one time.
For events at Coors Field with projected attendance of over 40,000, for which the
crowd is expected to all be present at one time.
At other venues where the ratio of projected attendance to available on-site parking is
6:1 and for which the crowd is expected to all be present at one time.

This service will not be provided when substantial numbers of the event patrons can be
expected to arrive in privately operated or non-profit owned buses or regularly scheduled
RTD service.
RTD will provide Express Shuttle service to Invesco Field and Coors Field from selected
Park-n-Rides for events described in this section. The General Manager must specifically
authorize Park-n-Ride service for other events.

8. Shuttles & Circulators
8.1 Characteristics
Shuttle and circulator routes are not defined as a separate class of service, but are
typically proposed to serve specific, local, community-focused needs. Shuttle and
circulator routes are generally defined by the following characteristics: short routes,
usually less than 5 miles long; operate on local streets and arterials; connect major activity
centers; and serve short passenger trip lengths within a single community. Fares must be
set according to RTD Fare Policy.

8.2 Guidelines for Success
Several factors are critical to shuttle and circulator success. As a guideline to make
informed decisions, the following characteristics must be present and considered.
•

A sustained average population density of at least 10 people per acre along the length
of the route is a minimum requirement; a critical mass of potential riders is needed to
succeed.

•

Connects community residences with major activity centers such as colleges, high
schools, middle schools, shopping districts (but not auto-centric malls), medical
centers, and downtowns that appeal to all market segments (youth, families, seniors)
and can serve a variety of trip purposes.

•

Transit friendly environment: pedestrian friendly, walkable streets are a minimum;
mixed land uses; areas of clustered shopping or employment; public spaces; and
bicycle parking/paths.

To attract spontaneous walk up use, the headway needs to be15 minutes or less for a
service span for the intended markets, typically 6:00 – 18:00 or longer.

•

Offers bi-directional service.

•

Does not substantially duplicate a service of comparable utility.

9. System-Wide Cost Recovery Standard
The state required system-wide minimum cost recovery ratio is 30 percent. This ratio is
calculated by the following formula:
[Farebox Revenues + Advertising Revenues + Lease Revenues + FTA Operating
Assistance + Other Non-Sales Tax Revenues ] / [Category Costs applied according to
RTD Cost Model Memo, June 15, 2010, as updated (See summary below)]

Cost Model Summary
With the exception of Private Carrier costs, all costs are allocated to routes by one of
three methods: hours, miles or vehicles. The RTD Bus Cost Model has five cost categories:
Variable/Direct, Variable/Indirect, Private Carrier, Retained Costs and Depreciation. Private
Carrier costs are allocated to routes by the number of hours the contractor operates the
route, multiplied by the average hourly rate billed for that particular contract, plus the
average hourly cost for fuel.
The annual budget and six-year Strategic Budget Plan are evaluated using this cost
recovery standard. If the standard is not met, several courses of action may be taken.
The RTD Board has adopted a policy of evaluating the fare structure as part of the annual
budget process; fares may be changed at that time to provide additional revenue. RTD
may also choose to market its services more aggressively to attract more customers and
their fares, or RTD may look for revenue from other sources. The productivity standards in
Sections 2 and 3 may be used to reduce the costs of providing service while disrupting
service to as few passengers as possible.

10. Title VI & Environmental Justice Compliance
RTD follows FTA Circular 4072.1B “Title VI Requirements and Guidelines for Federal
Transit Administration Recipients,” Chapter 4.4.
Title VI Protected Classes are race, color and national origin.

11. Standard for Service for Transit Dependent Persons and
To Social Service Destinations
For purposes of these service standards, transit dependent riders are defined as riders who
either live in a household which does not own a car or who have a physical or mental
disability that prevents the transit patron from driving a car. Social Service destinations
are those destinations that are provided as a public service that may not have consistently
sufficient ridership to otherwise warrant the establishment or continuation of a route or
route segment. Examples of social service destinations would include county court
facilities, hospitals, schools, or public institutions which have been situated or constructed
in isolated locations prior to the establishment of RTD or following review and comment by
RTD of the proposed development plans of such institution or agency, by the appropriate
jurisdiction.

11.1 Purpose of the Standard
This standard is intended to provide for consideration of transit dependency in service
decisions. This standard does not guarantee a minimum level of service to all transitdependent riders. However, it will ensure that transit-dependent riders and/or the need to
have access to social service destinations are identified and considered when decisions are
made to reduce service levels in an area.

11.2 Determination of Transit Dependency
Whenever RTD plans changes to an existing route where there is no alternative service
available to meet the area coverage standards in Section 5 such as a change in routing or
span of service, transit-dependent riders will be identified through on-board surveys. This
survey will ask questions about riders' travel habits and demographics, and it will attempt
to identify transit-dependent riders and their destinations.

15.A.c

Service Development Policies & Standards

15.A.c

The applicable minimum productivity standards for a route will be reduced by one-half the
percentage of ridership that is defined as transit dependent. Thus, if 60 percent of the
riders on a route are transit dependent, the route must achieve 70 percent [100 percent
minus (60 percent divided by 2)] of the applicable productivity standards (ridership and
economic) in order not to be considered a poor performer.
Applicable ridership standards for fixed route services may be found in Section 2.3, and
for non-fixed route services, in Section 2.4.
If the on-board survey reveals that the route does not serve the destinations desired by
transit-dependent riders, RTD may restructure the route to improve service and increase
ridership. This could include changing the routing or schedule to serve passenger needs.
RTD wishes to provide transit dependent riders with service that fits their needs and to
provide service to social service destinations when there is even a modicum of recognized
demand.
Another consideration to be given in whether or not to eliminate a route with some transit
dependent passengers is the impact on required Access-A-Ride services. The Americans
with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires that eligible persons with disabilities be provided with
paratransit service if they have trip origins and destinations within a defined service area
three-fourths of a mile from a non-commuter fixed route. If accessible fixed route service
is considered for removal from a portion of the defined paratransit service area, an
estimate of the demand for substitute Access-A-Ride service for persons with disabilities
who require lift-equipped buses must be completed and a cost-benefit analysis performed
for the alternatives (leaving fixed route versus providing Access-A-Ride service).

12. Service Change Process
The following is a description of the steps necessary in developing and implementing
service changes, which are typically conducted each year in January, May and
September—also called runboards—as required by Board policy and the Collective
Bargaining Agreement.
Proposals are derived from a variety of inputs continuously throughout the year including:
periodic customer, household and employer surveys; stakeholder meetings; service
performance evaluation; and changing demographics and land uses. They are compiled for
each runboard and evaluated based on a number of factors, including RTD annual budget,
RTD Service Standards, effects on the transit network and on transit dependent markets
(Title VI), cost-effective services throughout the District and responsiveness to changes in
the communities within RTD. A Board paper is compiled and presented to the Board,
stakeholders and public for consideration.
Staff then discusses the proposals with members of the Board, stakeholders and senior
staff and coordinates with other staff including Marketing, Operations, Facilities and
Finance. Modifications are made as warranted and then the proposals enter the pubic

engagement process: formally scheduled public hearings; informal presentations upon
request; repository for customer input—service.changes@rtd-denver; responses to General
Manager and Board Member requests. Upon completion of public engagement, all
previous input is compiled and evaluated and revisions to the proposals are made as
warranted. A final Board report is prepared with a summary and details of proposed
changes and a summary of public hearings and other public input for approval of the
Board.
The approved changes then go into a comprehensive production process which includes:
schedule creation; bus and operator requirements and assignments; compliance with
privatization policy; runcutting and compliance with the Collective Bargaining Agreement;
marketing promotions and public relations; bus stop and on-street changes; printed and
electronic public information, including maps and timetables; and validation and
distribution of all data within the Transit Information Exchange System (TIES).

13. Cost Sharing Policy
13.1 Background
On June 21, 1994, the RTD Board of Directors passed a resolution, Transit Service CostSharing Policy, to provide guidance to RTD staff in responding to the increasing number of
requests for new service. This policy authorized the General Manager to pursue cost
sharing as a method of providing transit service using RTD revenues and other funds
voluntarily pledged by private employers, businesses or local governments; this has
resulted in a number of RTD partnerships in demonstrating new services. The following
incorporates this experience and provides guidance on the application and limitations of
cost-sharing arrangements.

13.2 Guidance
13.2.1 Financial Feasibility
Financial feasibility depends not only on the availability of funds, but also on consideration
of fares, cost/revenue allocation and equity.
•

•

Net operating cost (subsidy) needs to be defined so that all partners are treated
equitably. Net cost is the total operating cost less farebox revenue and other operating
revenues and any grant revenues secured on behalf of the proposed service. The
application of grant revenues prior to the net cost sharing allows all partners to
participate in the benefits of grant funding.
Cost-sharing projects need to adopt the RTD fare structure for similar services for
reasons of equity. Furthermore, this places all projects on the same revenue basis for
calculating net operating cost. Project sponsors may propose a fare that does not
follow the RTD fare structure. For these projects the partner is required to fund the full
difference in revenue between the comparable RTD fare and the project fare, based on

Packet Pg. 70

15.A.c

Service Development Policies & Standards

•

actual ridership. The adoption of any non-conforming (economically or technically) fare
is always subject to Board approval.
Costs associated with vehicles are addressed project by project. Vehicles can be
purchased outright by project sponsors with grant funds or provided from the RTD
inventory. Should new vehicles be required, grants should fund their acquisition and
the local share split equally by the cost-sharing partners. If no grant funds are used,
RTD will limit its share to 10%, half of the usual local share when grant funds are
used. If the RTD operates the service and agrees to provide the vehicles from its
inventory, capital costs need not be included as part of the project cost unless special
accommodations are required.
Cost-sharing projects are new or expanded transit services and RTD’s share must be
budgeted out of allocations for new services for the entire District. Thus any partner
with expectations for RTD financial or operational participation must first obtain
commitment from RTD before applying for project grants. In addition, each project will
be subject to the appropriate RTD and DRCOG planning processes, especially as
regards estimates of costs, ridership, revenue and other benefits.

13.2.2 Vehicle Availability
RTD may have, with some minor modifications, vehicles readily available to provide the
proposed service. In some cases projects require a specialty or significantly modified
vehicle that must be acquired, subject to RTD approval for fleet maintenance compatibility.
Financing these vehicles is addressed above. Sometimes the availability of operators has
been more critical.
13.2.3 Local and Community Support
Local and community entities (e.g., government, employers, businesses and associations)
generally initiate cost-sharing transit projects concomitant with other plans and
developments in the community. Thus the proposed transit project is designed to address
a specific development or perceived need. To advance their project for implementation, an
entity such as a city, will offer to share in the net costs of providing the service. RTD
needs to be responsive to these requests, but keep them in the context of the needs of
the entire District.
•

•
•

Projects generally have substantial institutional support; however they are subject to
the same public scrutiny, for example public hearings, as any other proposed service
change. Implementation of any cost-sharing project will continue to be subject to
RTD’s public review process.
RTD generally provides 50% of the local share of the net operating and/or capital cost
of a project. This cost-sharing ratio may be adjusted in consideration of the District
budget and policies.
Cost-sharing arrangements for each project are of limited duration for which agreed
upon performance milestones must be reached (see below). The purpose of the test
period is to assess the sustainability of the service and decide RTD’s and its partners
continuing participation. The test period is typically set at one, two or three years, as
appropriate to the project. Performance milestones must be set and evaluated and a
recommendation regarding continuation made for each year of the project.

Cost-sharing services will have clearly defined evaluative criteria agreed upon within the
cost-sharing agreement and prior to implementation.
•

•

•

•

At a minimum these criteria will include average daily ridership and RTD Service
Standards within the appropriate class of service for passenger boardings per hour and
subsidy per boarding. Additional criteria may also address issues related to project
objectives, such as new riders. State mandated cost recovery may also be considered.
Expectations of performance will be laid out in the form of milestones, such as a range
or minimum attainment at the end of each year.
During the first year performance will be assessed to determine if expectations have
been met and if continuation of the service is warranted. Often an experimental
service will need to be changed to improve performance. As warranted the same
assessment will be made in each succeeding year during the test period. This
assessment and recommendation regarding continuation will be reported to the RTD
Board each year of the test period.
If the cost-share service meets expectations and RTD Service Standards during the test
period, RTD will consider extending the period of its participation and increasing its
share of net cost; however, RTD is under no obligation to continuing any service
beyond the cost-share agreement, even if it meets Service Standards. If the cost-share
service does not perform up to expectations, RTD funding participation in such project
will be reduced or discontinued. These decisions are subject to the customary financial
and Board review.
Should RTD decide to discontinue or reduce its funding of the project service, a
sponsoring partner may choose to continue its funding by entering into a cost-sharing
agreement with RTD. This agreement will specify the service to be provided and its
cost, will be annually reviewed for potential renewal and will be subject to all RTD
Service Standards, budgeting and public processes.

INTRODUCTION:
The Internal Audit Function is an independent and objective assurance and consulting function that is guided by
a philosophy of adding value to improve the operations of the Regional Transportation District (RTD). The Internal
Audit Function assists RTD in accomplishing its objectives by bringing a systematic and disciplined approach to
evaluate and improve the effectiveness of RTD's governance, risk management, and internal control.

PURPOSE:
The purpose of the Internal Audit Function is to strengthen the Regional Transportation District’s ability to create,
protect, and sustain value by providing the RTD Board of Directors and RTD Executive Leadership Team with
independent, risk-based, and objective assurance, advice, insight, and foresight.
The Internal Audit Function enhances:
•

Successful achievement of its strategic goals.

•

Governance, risk management, and control processes.

•

Decision-making and oversight.

•

Reputation and credibility with its stakeholders.

•

Ability to serve the public interest.

RTD’s Internal Audit Function is most effective when:
•

Internal auditing is performed by competent professionals in conformance with The IIA’s Global Internal
Audit Standards, which are set in the public interest.

•

The Internal Audit Function is independently positioned with direct accountability to the RTD Board
Directors’ Audit Committee (Audit Committee).

•

Internal auditors are free from undue influence and committed to making objective assessments.

RTD’s Internal Audit Function will adhere to the professional requirements of the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants, Global Internal Audit Standards, best practice guidelines, and any applicable public
transportation regulatory requirements.

AUTHORITY:
The Internal Audit Function, with strict accountability for confidentiality and safeguarding of records and information,
is authorized full, free, and unrestricted access to any and all RTD records, physical properties, and personnel
pertinent to carrying out any engagement. All RTD employees must assist the Internal Audit Function in fulfilling its
roles and responsibilities. The Internal Audit Function and Chief Audit Executive (CAE) have direct access to the Audit
Committee and the Board.

Internal Audit Function Charter

15.B.a

Subject: Internal Audit Function Charter
Page 2
The Internal Audit Function’s authority is created by its direct reporting relationship to the Audit Committee. Such
authority allows for unrestricted access to the Board.

The Internal Audit Function must remain free from interference by any party in RTD regarding matters of audit
selection, scope, procedures, frequency, timing, or report content to permit maintenance of a necessary independent
and objective mental attitude.
Internal auditors must not have direct operational responsibility or authority over any of the activities audited.
Accordingly, internal auditors must not implement internal controls, develop procedures, install systems, prepare
records, or engage in any other activity that may impair the internal auditors’ judgment.
Internal auditors must exhibit the highest level of professional objectivity in gathering, evaluating, and communicating
information about the activity or process being examined. Internal auditors must make a balanced assessment of all
the relevant circumstances and not be unduly influenced by their own interests or by others in forming judgments.
The CAE must confirm to the Audit Committee, at least annually, the organizational independence of the Internal
Audit Function. If the governance structure changes in a way that does not support organizational independence,
the CAE will document the characteristics of the governance structure limiting independence and any safeguards
employed to achieve the principle of independence. The CAE will disclose to the Audit Committee any interference
internal auditors encounter related to the scope, performance, or communication of internal audit work and
results. The disclosure will include communicating the implications of such interference on the Internal Audit
Function’s effectiveness and ability to fulfill its mandate.

ORGANIZATION:
The CAE will be positioned at a level in the organization that enables internal audit services and responsibilities
to be performed without interference from management, thereby establishing the independence of the Internal
Audit Function.
The CAE will report functionally to the Audit Committee of the Board and administratively (for example, day-today operations) to RTD’s General Manager and Chief Executive Officer (GM/CEO).

OVERSIGHT:
To establish, maintain, and ensure that RTD’s Internal Audit Function has sufficient authority to fulfill its duties,
the Audit Committee, subject to Board approval, will:
•

Discuss with the CAE and RTD Executive Leadership Team the appropriate authority, role, responsibilities,
scope, and services (assurance and/or advisory) of the Internal Audit Function.

•

Ensure the CAE has unrestricted access to and communicates and interacts directly with the Audit
Committee.

CHIEF AUDIT EXECUTIVE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
Ethics and Professionalism
The CAE will ensure that internal auditors:
•

Conform with the Global Internal Audit Standards, including the principles of Ethics and Professionalism:
integrity, objectivity, competency, due professional care, and confidentiality.

•

Understand, respect, meet, and contribute to the legitimate and ethical expectations of the organization
and be able to recognize conduct that is contrary to those expectations.

•

Encourage and promote an ethics-based culture in the organization.

Objectivity
The CAE will ensure that the Internal Audit Function remains free from all conditions that threaten the ability of
internal auditors to carry out their responsibilities in an unbiased manner, including matters of engagement
selection, scope, procedures, frequency, timing, and communication. If the chief audit executive determines that
objectivity may be impaired in fact or appearance, the details of the impairment will be disclosed to appropriate
parties.
Internal auditors will maintain an unbiased mental attitude that allows them to perform engagements objectively
such that they believe in their work product, do not compromise quality, and do not subordinate their judgment
on audit matters to others, either in fact or appearance.

Internal auditors will not implement internal controls, develop procedures, install systems, or engage in other
activities that may impair their judgment, including:

15.B.a

•

Identify and consider trends and emerging issues that could impact RTD’s operations and communicate to
the Audit Committee and RTD Executive Leadership Team as appropriate.

•

Consider emerging trends and successful practices in internal auditing.

•

Establish and ensure adherence to methodologies designed to guide the Internal Audit Function.

•

Ensure adherence to RTD’s relevant policies and procedures unless such policies and procedures conflict
with the internal audit charter or the Global Internal Audit Standards. Any such conflicts will be resolved or
documented and communicated to the Audit Committee and RTD Executive Leadership Team.

•

Coordinate activities and consider relying upon the work of other internal and external providers of
assurance and advisory services. If the chief audit executive cannot achieve an appropriate level of
coordination, the issue must be communicated to senior management and if necessary escalated to the
Audit Committee.

Communication with the Audit Committee and RTD Executive Leadership Team
The CAE will report to the Audit Committee and RTD Executive Leadership Team regarding:
•

The Internal Audit Function’s mandate.

•

The internal audit plan and performance are relative to its plan.

•

Internal audit budget.

•

Significant revisions to the internal audit plan and budget.

•

Potential impairments to independence, including relevant disclosures as applicable.

focus that could interfere with the achievement of the agency’s strategic objectives.

•

Results of assurance and advisory services.

•

Resource requirements.

•

Management’s responses to risk that the Internal Audit Function determines may be unacceptable or
acceptance of a risk that is beyond RTD’s risk appetite.

INTERNAL AUDIT PLAN:
At least annually, the CAE must submit to the Audit Committee and RTD Executive Leadership Team an internal audit
plan for review and approval. The internal audit plan consists of a work schedule as well as budget and resource
requirements for the next fiscal/calendar year. The CAE communicates the impact of resource limitations and
significant interim changes to Executive Leadership and the Audit Committee. The internal audit plan is developed
based on a prioritization of the audit universe using a risk-based methodology, including input of Executive Leadership
and the Board. The CAE reviews and adjusts the plan, as necessary, in response to changes in RTD’s business, risks,
operations, programs, systems, and controls. Any significant deviation from the approved internal audit plan must be
communicated to Executive Leadership and the Board through periodic activity reports.

REPORTING AND MONITORING:

The internal audit report may include responses from Executive Leadership and corrective action taken or to be taken
regarding the specific findings and recommendations. Responses from Executive Leadership, whether included within
the original audit report or provided thereafter (i.e. within thirty days) by management of the audited area, should
include a timetable for anticipated completion of action to be taken and an explanation for any corrective action that
will not be implemented.
The Internal Audit Function is responsible for appropriate follow-up on engagement findings and recommendations.
All significant findings remain in an open issues file until they are cleared.
The CAE periodically reports to RTD Executive Leadership Team and the Audit Committee on the Internal Audit
Function’s purpose, authority, and responsibility, as well as performance relative to its plan. Reporting must also
include significant risk exposures and control issues, including fraud risks, governance issues, and other matters
needed or requested by the RTD Executive Leadership Team and the Board.

QUALITY ASSURANCE AND IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM:
The Internal Audit Function maintains a quality assurance and improvement program that covers all aspects of the
internal audit function. The program includes an evaluation of the Internal Audit Function’s conformance with the
Definition of Internal Auditing and the Standards and an evaluation of whether internal auditors apply the Code of
Ethics. The program also assesses the efficiency and effectiveness of the Internal Audit Function and identifies
opportunities for improvement.
The CAE communicates to Executive Leadership, the Audit Committee, and the Board on the Internal Audit
Function’s quality assurance and improvement program, including results of ongoing internal assessments and
external assessments conducted at least every five years.

INTERNAL AUDIT SERVICES
The scope of internal audit services covers the entire operation of the agency, including all RTD’s activities, assets,
and personnel. The scope of the internal audit activities also encompasses, but is not limited to, objective
examinations of evidence to provide independent assurance and advisory services to the Board and management on
the adequacy and effectiveness of governance, risk management, and control processes for RTD. This includes:
•

Evaluating risk exposure relating to achievement of RTD’s strategic objectives

•

Evaluating the reliability and integrity of information and the means used to identify, measure, classify, and
report such information

•

Evaluating the systems established to ensure compliance with those policies, plans, procedures, laws, and
regulations that could have a significant impact on RTD

INTRODUCTION:
The Internal Audit Function is an independent and objective assurance and consulting function that is guided by
a philosophy of adding value to improve the operations of the Regional Transportation District (RTD). The Internal
Audit Function assists RTD in accomplishing its objectives by bringing a systematic and disciplined approach to
evaluate and improve the effectiveness of RTD's governance, risk management, and internal control.

PURPOSE:
The purpose of the Internal Audit Function is to strengthen the Regional Transportation District’s ability to create,
protect, and sustain value by providing the RTD Board of Directors and RTD Executive Leadership Team with
independent, risk-based, and objective assurance, advice, insight, and foresight.
The Internal Audit Function enhances:
•

Successful achievement of its strategic goals.

•

Governance, risk management, and control processes.

•

Decision-making and oversight.

•

Reputation and credibility with its stakeholders.

•

Ability to serve the public interest.

RTD’s Internal Audit Function is most effective when:
•

Internal auditing is performed by competent professionals in conformance with The IIA’s Global Internal
Audit Standards, which are set in the public interest.

•

The Internal Audit Function is independently positioned with direct accountability to the RTD Board
Directors’ Audit Committee (Audit Committee).

•

Internal auditors are free from undue influence and committed to making objective assessments.

RTD’s Internal Audit Function will adhere to the professional requirements of the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants, Global Internal Audit Standards, best practice guidelines, and any applicable public
transportation regulatory requirements.

AUTHORITY:
The Internal Audit Function, with strict accountability for confidentiality and safeguarding of records and information,
is authorized full, free, and unrestricted access to any and all RTD records, physical properties, and personnel
pertinent to carrying out any engagement. All RTD employees must assist the Internal Audit Function in fulfilling its
roles and responsibilities. The Internal Audit Function and Chief Audit Executive (CAE) have direct access to the Audit
Committee and the Board.

The Internal Audit Function’s authority is created by its direct reporting relationship to the Audit Committee.
Such authority allows for unrestricted access to the Board.

The Internal Audit Function must remain free from interference by any party in RTD regarding matters of audit
selection, scope, procedures, frequency, timing, or report content to permit maintenance of a necessary independent
and objective mental attitude.
Internal auditors must not have direct operational responsibility or authority over any of the activities audited.
Accordingly, internal auditors must not implement internal controls, develop procedures, install systems, prepare
records, or engage in any other activity that may impair the internal auditors’ judgment.
Internal auditors must exhibit the highest level of professional objectivity in gathering, evaluating, and communicating
information about the activity or process being examined. Internal auditors must make a balanced assessment of all
the relevant circumstances and not be unduly influenced by their own interests or by others in forming judgments.
The CAE must confirm to the Audit Committee, at least annually, the organizational independence of the Internal
Audit Function. If the governance structure changes in a way that does not support organizational independence,
the CAE will document the characteristics of the governance structure limiting independence and any safeguards
employed to achieve the principle of independence. The CAE will disclose to the Audit Committee any interference
internal auditors encounter related to the scope, performance, or communication of internal audit work and
results. The disclosure will include communicating the implications of such interference on the Internal Audit
Function’s effectiveness and ability to fulfill its mandate.

ORGANIZATION:
The CAE will be positioned at a level in the organization that enables internal audit services and responsibilities
to be performed without interference from management, thereby establishing the independence of the Internal
Audit Function.
The CAE will report functionally to the Audit Committee of the Board and administratively (for example, day-today operations) to RTD’s General Manager and Chief Executive Officer (GM/CEO).

OVERSIGHT:
To establish, maintain, and ensure that RTD’s Internal Audit Function has sufficient authority to fulfill its duties,
the Audit Committee, subject to Board approval, will:
•

Discuss with the CAE and RTD Executive Leadership Team the appropriate authority, role,
responsibilities, scope, and services (assurance and/or advisory) of the Internal Audit Function.

•

Ensure the CAE has unrestricted access to and communicates and interacts directly with the Audit
Committee.

BOARD CHAIR REQUESTED AGENDA ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Amendments to Board Operating Guidelines Regarding
Engagement with Staff and Meeting Time Management

March 20, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
March 25, 2025

Added to Committee Agenda by the Chair pursuant to RTD Board Bylaws Article VI., Section 1(b).
Requires formal motion and second at Committee meeting.
MOTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt amendments to the Board Operating Guidelines regarding
engagement with staff time and meeting time management.
REPRESENTATIVE
Julien Bouquet, Chair
Jack Kroll, Board Office Executive Manager
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
In February 2008, the Board developed the first version of its Operating Guidelines to improve
communication between Directors and staff as well as the overall effectiveness of the Board’s work. The
Board subsequently revisited the guidelines in 2014 and later overhauled the guidelines in 2018. In
2019, the Board passed resolution No. 1 Series of 2019 “to recommit annually, during a meeting in the
first quarter of each year, to uphold these principles and to amend them as necessary to reflect current
practices.” Subsequently, the Board amended these guidelines in May of 2024 and again in September
of 2024.
In February 2025, the Executive Committee considered the proposed amendments as a Discussion Item.
Subsequently the Board Office solicited feedback from the full Board and incorporated feedback into the
proposed amendments.
Also attached to this item are resolutions the Board has previously passed related to both the use of
staff time and treatment of staff. They are provided to highlight the constant need for the Board to
examine its practices in both regards.
DISCUSSION
After taking feedback from Directors on what items to add to the Operating Guidelines and refining
those proposals, Chair Bouquet is recommending the following adjustments to the Operating Guidelines
to set parameters on how Directors engage with staff and time management within Board and
Committee meetings.

Packet Pg. 118

15.D

Regarding engagement with staff, the proposed amendments provide guidance on the following:
Use of staff time
Professionalism and respect expected in interactions with staff
With respect to meeting time management, the proposed amendments provide guidance on the
following:
Length of time each Director should speak on a topic during a board or committee meeting
Role of the meeting chair in ensuring efficient meetings
Length of time dedicated to each agenda item
Directors are asked to review the proposed amendments offered by Chair Bouquet and vote on whether
to approve the proposed changes.
This discussion aligns with the Strategic Priorities of Community Value and Employee Ownership
considering how Directors engage with staff and one another directly impacts the value the Board can
provide to the community and how Directors model behavior for others at the agency.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact to the Board acting to amend its Operating Guidelines.

RTD BOARD OPERATING GUIDELINES
LAST UPDATED: MARCH 25, 2025
BOARD COMMITMENT
Our Board is committed to public transit and the strategic goals of the Regional Transportation
District. In meeting this commitment, we appreciate that the Board adds the greatest value when
it focuses on and helps clarify policy issues and plans, including the policies that underpin capital
and operating budgets. In setting policies and plans, the Board must understand the vision and
mission of RTD and its immediate and future priority objectives for coming years as well as the
long-term strategic plan. The Board appreciates that it must position RTD to be able to respond
flexibly, effectively, and transparently to unique factors as they present, including the current
organizational shift in focus from capital development to operations and maintenance with the
exception of identifying suitable solutions to finish the remaining FasTracks projects, challenges
in optimizing service levels in order to meet customer demands, and the introduction of evolving
transit technologies, in order better to serve our constituents in new and varying ways. As elected
officials, we each represent different districts with differing needs, and we have a responsibility
to each of our constituents and to the overall well-being of the agency as a whole. We also
recognize that this Board, by statute, has both policy-setting and executive functions it must
perform.
BOARD VALUES
We value the collective Board wisdom that is gained through considered deliberations. Thus, we
value openness in our discussions, diversity of perspectives, and civility in our conversations. We
also place a premium on deliberations that are both efficient and effective. Recognizing that
issues will vary in their complexity, we value timely decision-making.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
May 2025 Title VI Service Equity Analysis

March 12, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
March 25, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors (Board) to adopt the Title VI Service Equity Analysis report for the May 2025
service changes to comply with federal laws, regulations, and guidelines related to Title VI of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Martin Romero, Transit Equity Manager, Civil Rights Division
Carl Green Jr., Director, Civil Rights Division
Jessie Carter II, Senior Manager, Service Planning and Scheduling
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
The service changes proposed for May 2025 facilitate opportunities for frontline employees to select
new work assignments and for Service Development to adjust the overall operations plan for the transit
network. Additionally, with the Board’s adoption of the System Optimization Plan (SOP) in July 2022,
several of the service change proposals reflect SOP implementation to provide the best possible value to
customers.
The Board-adopted guidance for proposed service changes continues to be:
• Service performance evaluation based on service standards
• Maintaining the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit-dependent markets
• Making alternative services available to affected customers
• Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible
• Compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard
to race, color, or national origin; also, disparate effects on low-income and minority populations1
• Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
Service Equity Analysis Requirements of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI. In this circular, the FTA requires RTD
to evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that exceed the established major
service change threshold to determine whether those changes will disproportionately impact Black or
1

Hereinafter referred to as BIPOC populations.

Packet Pg. 133

16.E

Indigenous populations or populations of Persons of Color (collectively “BIPOC”) or low-income
populations. The May 2025 service change recommendation includes nine major service changes out of
35 total changes. Thus, an analysis is required to be brought before the Board for its consideration. The
complete Title VI Service Equity Analysis report is included in Attachment A.
Title VI Service Equity Analysis Policies
Per FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Major Service Change Policy, a Disparate
Impact Policy, and a Disproportionate Burden Policy. Collectively, these policies provide the foundational
requirements for evaluating service change proposals for equity. These policies and their applicable
thresholds are listed below:
•

Major Service Change Policy: A major service change is defined as a 25% addition or reduction in
the service hours of any route that would remain in effect for 12 or more months. All major
service changes will be subject to an equity analysis.

•

Title VI Policies:
Disparate Impact Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a minority population
10% more than non-minority populations; this level of impact is considered a disparate impact.
Disproportionate Burden Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a low-income
population 10% more than higher-income populations; this level of impact is considered a
disproportionate burden. A low-income population is a group of households who are at or below
150% of the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.

DISCUSSION
Staff recommends changes to 29 bus routes (and related patterns) and six rail lines in the forthcoming
service change recommendation. Of these changes, nine services have proposed additions to service
25% greater than that of baseline service and thus meet established thresholds for a major service
change. Those routes are shown in the following table.

Schedule Timing

BOLT

Service Increase

Free MetroRide, 16, 44, 73, 153, NB

Route Adjustment

225/225D, DASH

Methodology: Disparate impact and disproportionate burden analyses were performed at the route/line
level, route/line block group, and system level to identify any potential disparities in service changes
based on race/ethnicity or income.

Packet Pg. 134

16.E

Summary of Findings:
• Potential disparate impacts were identified at the individual route level for the four following
routes:
o Free MetroRide. A lower percentage of the district’s BIPOC population benefits from the
proposed major service increase as compared to the non-BIPOC population (0.16%). A higher
percentage of the district’s low-income population stands to benefit from the proposed major
service increase as compared to the non-low-income population (0.23%).
o Route 225/225D. A lower percentage of the district’s BIPOC population benefits from the
proposed major service increase as compared to the non-BIPOC population (0.67-0.68%). A
higher percentage of the district’s low-income population stands to benefit from the proposed
major service increase as compared to the non-low-income population (1.43-1.44%).
o DASH. A lower percentage of the district’s BIPOC population benefits from the proposed
major service increase as compared to the non-BIPOC population (0.55-0.75%). A higher
percentage of the district’s low-income population stands to benefit from the proposed major
service increase as compared to the non-low-income population (1.03%).
o Route NB. A lower percentage of the district’s BIPOC population benefits from the proposed
major service increase as compared to the non-BIPOC population (0.19%). A slightly higher
percentage of the district’s low-income population stands to benefit from the proposed major
service increase as compared to non-low-income population (0.23%).
•

No potential disproportionate burden findings were identified at the route level.

•

The proposed major service changes were examined in aggregate, at the system level, to
determine overall impacts to equity populations compared to non-equity populations. For systemlevel service changes (all increases), BIPOC populations stand to benefit less than non-BIPOC
populations (43.97% vs. 50.82%, respectively). This difference meets the disparate impact
threshold of 45.74%. Therefore, there is a system-level disparate impact finding with the
proposed major service increases. Low-income populations stand to benefit more than non-lowincome populations (64.09% vs. 41.23%, respectively). The difference does not meet the 10%
disproportionate burden threshold of 37.1%. Therefore, no system-level disproportionate burden
is found with the proposed major service increases.

Conclusions:
Although four major service changes resulted in a potential disparate impact and a system-level disparate
impact finding, RTD recommends proceeding with the May 2025 service plan as proposed. This decision
is based on the substantial legitimate justification of implementing these improvements in alignment with
the Board-approved System Optimization Plan, as well as the lack of practical alternatives to avoid,
minimize, or mitigate these impacts. The proposed service plan offers significant overall benefits to
customers, with notable advantages for BIPOC customers, even if they may not benefit as much from
the major service changes as other groups. Of the nine major service changes (out of 35 total), all serve
low-income communities, and four specifically serve BIPOC communities. Additionally, route-level
analysis indicates minimal Title VI concerns, with benefit differences of 0.16%, 0.67-0.68%, 0.550.75%, and 0.19% per route. Further, several service improvements that do not meet the major service
change threshold will enhance on-time performance for 14 bus routes and six rail lines, increase service

Packet Pg. 135

16.E

on the N Line, and implement five individual SOP-related initiatives. Since these changes represent
service increases, they benefit all RTD customers, including BIPOC and low-income individuals. As a
result, the major service changes do not raise concerns about the inequitable distribution of benefits.
In adopting this report, the agency seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Priorities of Community
Value and Customer Excellence while maintaining compliance with Title VI federal regulations. RTD will
continue to assess the equity implications for all subsequent service change proposals and will propose
adjustments and service alternatives as appropriate in future service change recommendations.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The adoption of the Title VI Service Equity Analysis will not result in any direct or foreseeable financial
impacts.

Executive Summary
This document summarizes the analysis of major service changes proposed for the May 2025 runboard to
ensure that the changes will not inequitably impact minority (hereafter referred to as Black, Indigenous, and
People of Color, or BIPOC) and low-income populations.

Methodology
RTD’s established Title VI program methodology defines the process to identify major service changes, disparate
impacts, and disproportionate burdens. RTD analyzed the route and block group levels to identify any potential
disparities in service changes based on race/ethnicity or income.

Major Service Changes
In the forthcoming runboard, RTD proposes changes to 29 bus routes (and related patterns) and six rail
lines. Of these changes, nine services meet established thresholds for a major service change.
The tabulation below includes proposed adjustments that were greater than 25% of baseline service and are
proposed for the long-term (will remain in effect for 12 or more months).

Schedule Timing

Service Increase (Six services)

Route Adjustment (Two services)

BOLT: Schedule adjustments to improve on-time performance
and to address construction impacts along Colorado Highway
119 and 28th Street.
Free MetroRide: Reinstate permanently during the AM and
PM Peak on weekdays with 10-minute headways.
Route 16: Service increase to provide 10-minute peak
frequency as depicted in the System Optimization Plan (SOP).
Route 44: Add two trips in each of the weekday AM and PM
peak periods, in the peak direction of travel only, to increase
frequency from 60 to 30 minutes.
Route 73: Increase service levels to match service described
in the RTD Board-adopted SOP.
Route 153: Increase service levels to match service described
in the RTD Board-adopted SOP.
NB: End seasonal service to Eldora Ski Resort while increasing
service levels to pre-COVID levels per the SOP: 60 minutes
weekdays, Saturdays, and Sundays/Holidays.
Route 225/225D: Extend the route to the new Boulder
County Low Income Housing Development, Willoughby, at
120th Avenue and Emma, weekdays, Saturdays, and Sundays.
DASH: Extend the route to the new Boulder County Low
Income Housing Development, Willoughby, at 120th Avenue
and Emma, weekdays, Saturdays, and Sundays.

Findings

Major service changes included in the proposed May 2025 service changes include increases to service levels
and spans, one route renaming, various running time/schedule improvements, route realignments due to
construction related detours, route extensions, as well as the suspensions of school tripper services while school
is out of session.
At the system level, four of the nine routes proposed for major service changes serve average or above-average
BIPOC populations compared to the entire service area, and all routes with major service changes are well above
the average threshold for low-income populations. When considering the demographics within the service area
of the major service increases and as a proportion to the district overall, areas with above-average low-income
populations received a 22.86% higher increase in service (i.e., were more positively impacted) compared to nonlow-income populations. This difference is above the 10% threshold. Areas with above-average BIPOC
populations received 6.85% less of an increase in service (i.e., were less positively impacted) compared to nonBIPOC populations. This difference does not meet the 10% threshold. However, at the route level, RTD identified
potential disparate impacts for the following four routes: Free MetroRide, Route 225/225D, DASH, and NB.
No population within the service area is proposed to be impacted by a service decrease.

Introduction
Title VI
Equity is a core principle of RTD’s functional mission to provide mass transit service within the Denver region.
An equitable mass transit system fairly distributes the benefits and adverse effects of transit service without
regard for race, color, national origin, or low-income status. This principle is detailed and reinforced by Title VI
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin in
programs receiving federal financial assistance. Specifically, Title VI states, “No person in the United States shall,
on the ground of race, color or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or
be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial assistance
with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI. In this circular, the FTA requires RTD to evaluate, prior
to implementation, any and all service changes that exceed the established major service change threshold, and
to determine whether those changes will have a disproportionately negative impact on populations comprising
Black, Indigenous, and People of Color or low-income populations.
RTD has prepared this equity analysis to document changes that are proposed to occur between the current and
proposed runboards. These changes and all others have been reviewed individually at the route/line level and
in aggregate at the block group level to identify potential impacts to the communities RTD serves.

Service Change Philosophy

An equity analysis is triggered by proposed major service changes to RTD’s transit services. These changes
include the addition of new routes/lines, the elimination of existing routes/lines, and changes to the alignment
and trip frequency within existing routes/lines. RTD has established principles to identify the service changes

needed to meet the diverse travel needs of those within the district and maintain a high-performance, sustainable
transit system.
RTD Service Changes Guiding Principles
•
•
•
•
•

•

Service performance evaluation based on service standards
The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets
The availability of alternative services to affected riders
Cost-effective distribution throughout the district and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible
Compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without
regard to race, color, or national origin; also, disparate effects on low-income and Black,
Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) populations
Response to changes in the communities where services are provided

RTD services are divided into various service classes (Family of Services) depending on service type, route
alignment, and frequency. Each service class has its own service standards derived from the performance of all
routes within each class. RTD continually and comprehensively adjusts services in response to changes in
ridership and operational performance of the transit system. It is also the agency’s responsibility to identify
services that are underperforming and recommend modifications, curtailment, or cancellation of service as
warranted. In keeping with Colorado Revised Statutes, RTD utilizes official service standards to establish
performance metrics used to identify underperforming services on a class-of-service basis. The agency uses
these metrics to identify a series of service changes.

…The general assembly further finds that the district should be organized efficiently,
economically, and on a demand-responsive basis and that the district should consider least-cost

RTD’s Title VI Equity Analysis Policies
Based on requirements within FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD, as an agency receiving federal funding,
must establish a Major Service Change Policy, a Disparate Impact Policy, and a Disproportionate Burden Policy.
Collectively, these policies provide foundational requirements for evaluating service change proposals for equity
and compliance with Title VI. These policies and their applicable thresholds are listed below:
1. Major Service Change: A major service change is defined as a 25% addition or reduction in the
service hours of any route that would remain in effect for 12 or more months. All major service
changes will be subject to an equity analysis that includes an analysis of adverse effects.
a. An Adverse Effect is defined as a geographical or temporal reduction in service that includes,
but is not limited to, eliminating a route, shortening a route by eliminating segments, rerouting
an existing route, and increasing headways. RTD shall consider the degree of adverse effects

and analyze those effects when planning major service changes.
2. Disparate Impact Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a BIPOC population 10
percent more than non-BIPOC populations; this level of impact is considered a disparate impact.
3. Disproportionate Burden Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a low-income
population 10% more than non-low-income populations; this level of impact is considered a
disproportionate burden. A low-income population is a group of households who are at or below 150%
of the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.
If a proposed major service change results in a disparate impact or a disproportionate burden, RTD will consider
modifying the proposed service change. RTD will then analyze the modification and make sure it removed the
potential disparate impact or disproportionate burden. If a less discriminatory option cannot be identified and
RTD can demonstrate a substantial legitimate justification for the proposed service change, the FTA may allow
RTD to proceed with the proposed change.

Analysis
Data Sources and Methodology

This analysis uses demographic data from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) 5-Year
Estimates for years 2019 to 2023 at the census block group geographic level. Other data related to the analysis
includes route alignments and block group geography. The linking of these datasets into a service-geographicdemographic combination relates populations with changes in service at a geographic level to aid in reviewing
potential impacts to district equity communities which include BIPOC and low-income populations.
The equity analysis for the May 2025 runboard looked at how an individual route’s major service changes
impacted the communities it served. The review needed to determine the proportional difference in changes
made to equity populations within a quarter-mile service area of a bus route or rail line. These proportional
differences were compared against district population proportions of equity populations and route/line
proportions of equity populations.
Low-income status for population within the district is derived from Census Bureau population estimates and is
based on 150% of the United States federal poverty level (Department of Health and Human Services
guidelines), based on local context, which is an annual income of $38,730 for a family of three. BIPOC status is
based on the non-white and Hispanic or Latino count of total population. The service area is based on the
collection of block groups wholly or partially within district boundaries.
Route/line service area population is determined using a quarter mile “catchment area” centered around bus
stops and rail stations. This catchment area is then used to calculate the percentage overlap of block groupbased population underneath. For instance, if a catchment area contains 100% of the underlying block group,
100% of the population would be associated with the services within a quarter mile; if 50% of a block group
was contained in the catchment area, only half of the underlying population would count as being included
(ratios of population demographics would be unchanged).
RTD calculates the net change in service hours for each route/line proposal to provide the percent difference
from baseline service hours. Any change meeting or exceeding a 25% change (either positive or negative) from
baseline is flagged as a major service change for further review.

Public Outreach Overview
RTD held three public meetings on March 3-4, 2025. Table 1 below provides a summary of the feedback received
on major service changes during these meetings, including the meeting locations, dates, attendance numbers,
and key themes from attendees' comments.
In addition to general outreach, the Transit Equity Office emailed 329 community-based organizations and key
activity centers—such as senior housing facilities, affordable housing communities, schools, places of worship,
and government social service agencies—to share information and gather feedback. The Communications and
Engagement Department also contacted 821 community members and key activity centers to inform them about
the proposed service changes and encourage public input.
To further raise awareness, RTD issued three news releases to regional media outlets and delivered multiple
presentations on the proposed changes to Subregional Service Councils, the Citizen Advisory Committee, and
Transportation Management Associations.

Major Service Change, Disparate Impact, and Disproportionate Burden
Analyses

RTD categorized proposed service changes for the runboard that resulted in a 25% or greater change in service
by equity population (BIPOC or non-BIPOC, low-income or non-low-income) for comparison. Routes/lines were
categorized as either “equity” or “non-equity” routes based on their identification within the prior (current)
network using 2019-2023 ACS five-year demographic data.
RTD completed a comparative, proportional equity analysis to review the routes/lines individually. This analysis
identified the equity and non-equity populations within a route/line service area and compared those against the
equity and non-equity populations of the district. If impacted equity populations within the route/line service
area received 10% or greater impacts compared to non-equity populations, the route/line had a potential finding
of Disparate Impact (for BIPOC populations) or Disproportionate Burden (for low-income populations) and was
flagged for a potential finding of impact.

Major Service Change Test
Identify routes with proposed major service changes (based on trips or hours) of 25% or more
that will remain in effect for 12 or more months

Changes by Transit Mode
For the May 2025 runboard, RTD proposes various service changes to 29 bus routes (and related route
patterns) and six rail lines. Of these, 20 routes will see combined increases in bus service of over 252 total
weekday revenue service hours and 84 additional weekend service hours. Routes 225 and DASH are
proposed to be extended to new areas of Boulder County, and the Free MetroRide will be permanently reinstated.
Major service increases are also proposed for six other bus routes.

Major Service Change Review

Please find a complete listing of all service changes in Appendix A. RTD first reviewed changes in aggregate
equity groupings of routes/lines prior to individual review of routes/lines, route/line block groups, and overall
network levels; equity grouping comparison occurred at every level. Major service changes are categorized as
the following:
•
•

Major Service Reductions (a service reduction of 25% or more)
Major Service Increases (service increases of 25% or more related to new or restructured service)

Major Service Change Reductions
There are no major service reductions proposed for the proposed runboard.

Major Service Change Increases

Nine bus routes had proposed major service increases. Improved headways are proposed for several routes,
and four routes have service increases as outlined in the RTD Board approval of the Systemwide Optimization
Plan (SOP).

Route- and Line-Level Analysis
Having identified the service changes which meet the definition of Major Service Change, the next step in the
analysis is to look at each route/line individually to determine potential Disparate Impacts (DI) and/or
Disproportionate Burdens (DB) on both service reductions and service increases. For service increases, the
analysis examines the extent to which BIPOC and low-income populations benefit compared to non-BIPOC
and/or non-low-income populations. For service decreases, the analysis examines the extent to which the
changes burden BIPOC and low-income populations compared to non-BIPOC and/or non-low-income
populations.

Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden Analysis
For each route/line with a major service change, determine the percent of the route’s/line’s
impacted equity and non-equity populations comprising the district’s equity and non-equity
populations; if the difference is greater than 10% for equity populations, additional review is
required for potential adverse impacts

In concert with RTD’s Title VI policies, RTD reviewed the demographics of each of the major service changes’
routes/lines for potential DI or DB findings. For service increases, the following analysis examines the extent to
which the benefits of the improvements are inclusive of BIPOC and low-income populations. Because these are
proposed service increases, protected populations falling below these thresholds are flagged for potential
concerns. The narrative analysis of each individual route/line follows, which includes further considerations of
access to jobs, education, health care, food, and social services for BIPOC and low-income populations.

Route 16
Proposal: As outlined in the RTD Board-approved SOP, it is proposed to increase service to provide 10-minute
peak frequency.
As shown in Table 3, a higher percentage of the district’s low-income population stands to benefit from the
proposed major service increase as compared to the non-low-income population (1.49% vs. 0.70%,
respectively). This difference is above the 10% disproportionate burden threshold (0.63%). Therefore, no
potential route-level disproportionate burden is found. A slightly higher percentage of the district’s BIPOC
population benefits from the proposed major service increase as compared to the non-BIPOC population (0.89%
vs. 0.80%, respectively). This difference is above the 10% disparate impact threshold (0.72%). Thus, there is
no potential disparate impact found at the route level requiring further examination (i.e., access to key public
service destinations, community engagement and network level analysis).

Route 44
Proposal: On weekdays, it is proposed to add two trips to each AM and PM peak period in the direction of peak
travel only to increase frequency from 60 to 30 minutes. Additional trip departures from Wheat Ridge include
those at 7 and 8 am. Additional trip departures from Civic Center Station include those at 5:10 and 6:10 pm.
As shown in Table 4, a slightly higher percentage of the district’s low-income population stands to benefit from
the proposed major service increase as compared to non-low-income population (2.42% vs. 1.68%,
respectively). This difference is above the 10% disproportionate burden threshold (1.51%). Therefore, no

DASH
Proposal: It is proposed to extend the route to the new Boulder County Low Income Housing Development,
Willoughby, at 120th Avenue and Emma, weekdays, Saturdays, and Sundays. Current Route DASH pattern would
extend from Lafayette Park-n-Ride via Public Road/Spaulding Street/Merlin Drive/Emma Street/120th Street to
the new terminal on Canterbury Drive. Service frequency is proposed to be every 30 minutes all day, weekdays
and Saturdays and every 60 minutes all day, Sundays, and Holidays.
As shown in Table 9, a higher percentage of the district’s low-income population stands to benefit from the
proposed major service increase as compared to non-low-income population (1.76% vs. 0.73%, respectively).
This difference is above the 10% disproportionate burden threshold (0.66%). Therefore, no potential route-level
disproportionate burden is found. A lower percentage of the district’s BIPOC population benefits from the
proposed major service increase as compared to the non-BIPOC population (0.52% vs. 1.27%, respectively).
This difference falls below the 10% disparate impact threshold (1.15%). Thus, there is a potential disparate
impact found at the route level requiring further examination (i.e., access to key public service destinations,
community engagement and network level analysis).

Systemwide Analysis

In accordance with RTD’s 2022 Title VI Program Update, a systemwide analysis is required in addition to routeand line-level analyses. A system-level analysis provides further understanding of changes to service levels for
Title VI-protected populations at aggregate levels.
The major service change threshold of 25% or greater used for individual route-level analyses was used as
precedent to determine potential adverse impacts overall and to identify structural issues in areas requiring
further review. Once average district thresholds for low-income and BIPOC populations are established,
subsequent equity analyses focused on the subset of district block groups that experienced major service
changes of 25% or greater (additions or reductions in service), and whether equity block groups with major
service changes experienced service changes of 10% or more compared to non-equity block groups. Routes
with major service changes are later comparatively reviewed for potential adverse effects at route-block group
levels (block groups within route service areas).
The analysis of all service changes identified the following:
•
•

Systemwide, bus service revenue hours increase by over 252 for weekday, 38 for Saturday, and 46 for
Sunday service.
Of the nearly 340,000 people served by stops within the service area with major service changes, BIPOC
populations represented a slightly below-average share of population while low-income populations

•

represented a much higher than average share of population compared to district averages. Of this total,
over 80,000 low-income people and over 118,000 BIPOC people would receive service improvements.
At the systemwide level, equity routes and non-equity routes1 were compared only for those with major
service changes. Bus routes with major service increases serve above-average low-income and slightly
below-average BIPOC populations. All routes are considered low-income-serving routes, while four of the
nine routes are considered BIPOC-serving routes.

In review of the proposed major service changes at the systemwide level, there is a potential
disparate impact finding.
An analysis of all district block groups and their service levels was conducted to establish the baseline equity
thresholds for low-income and BIPOC populations and to determine the systemwide magnitude of impacts of
the May 2025 service change. Block groups with low-income and BIPOC populations at or above the district
average are referred to in this analysis as “equity” block groups whereas block groups with non-low-income and
non-BIPOC populations are referred to as “non-equity” block groups.

Network Analysis Process
Determine block groups at/above district averages for low-income population (14.1%) and
BIPOC population (38.1%).
Determine which block groups experienced service changes of 25% or more.
Of block groups with a major service change, compare the difference in population for equity
versus non-equity block groups; if the difference is more than 10%, review for potential
adverse impacts.

There are 2,220 block groups defined as being wholly within or mostly within the District.2 Using the 2019-2023
5-Year ACS Estimates, total population residing within these block groups was calculated as well as the total
BIPOC population and total low-income population, calculated separately, to determine the District-wide lowincome and BIPOC rates which set the thresholds for which block groups are classified as above average. While
the percent BIPOC figure of 38.1% was derived by using the base population of the service area (3.08 million),
the low-income population percentage of 14.1% is derived from a slightly smaller population figure (3.04 million).
This is due to the smaller population whose poverty status the Census Bureau can determine.3 The thresholds
summarized in Error! Reference source not found. yielded 827 (37.2% of all) block groups above the district
average for low-income population, and 856 (38.6%) block groups above the district average for BIPOC
population.

Based on existence of the route within the January 2025 network and the population within a quarter mile of bus stops
or rail stations. 2019-2023 5-Year ACS estimates were used for population identification.
2
Some block groups are not completely contained within district boundaries due to differences in boundaries between the
District and Census-defined geographies.
3
The total population whose poverty status is determinable/assessed is lower than the estimate of total population due to
the inability of the Census to determine income for everyone estimated to reside in a particular block group.

For system-level service changes (all increases), BIPOC populations stand to benefit less than non-BIPOC
populations (43.97% vs. 50.82%, respectively). This difference meets the disparate impact threshold of
45.74%. Therefore, a system-level disparate impact finding is found with the proposed major service increase.
Low-income populations stand to benefit more than non-low-income populations (64.09% vs.
41.23%, respectively). The difference does not meet the 10% disproportionate burden threshold of 37.1%.
Therefore, no system-level disproportionate burden is found with the proposed major service increase.
Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the locations of above average low-income and BIPOC block groups within the District

many areas with above-average district averages for BIPOC and low-income populations such as Routes 16, 44,

Summary of Findings
The systemwide service modifications proposed for May 2025 include schedule adjustments, suspension of
school trips and changes to summer schedules, route extensions, and the addition of more service. Major
changes include those for Routes 16, 44, 73, 153, 225, DASH, Free MetroRide, BOLT, and NB.

Route-level Findings
Of the 35 total services with proposed changes, taken individually, four had potential findings:
•

•

•

•

Free MetroRide has a potential disparate impact. A lower percentage of the district’s BIPOC
population benefits from the proposed major service increase as compared to the non-BIPOC population
(0.16%). A higher percentage of the district’s low-income population stands to benefit from the proposed
major service increase as compared to the non-low-income population (0.23%).
Route 225/225D has a potential disparate impact. A lower percentage of the district’s BIPOC
population benefits from the proposed major service increase as compared to the non-BIPOC population
(0.67-0.68%). A higher percentage of the district’s low-income population stands to benefit from the
proposed major service increase as compared to non-low-income population (1.43-1.44%).
DASH has a potential disparate impact. A lower percentage of the district’s BIPOC population
benefits from the proposed major service increase as compared to the non-BIPOC population (0.550.75%). A higher percentage of the district’s low-income population stands to benefit from the proposed
major service increase as compared to the non-low-income population (1.03%).
Route NB has a potential disparate impact. A lower percentage of the district’s BIPOC population
benefits from the proposed major service increase as compared to the non-BIPOC population (0.19%).
A slightly higher percentage of the district’s low-income population stands to benefit from the proposed
major service increase as compared to non-low-income population (0.23%).

Systemwide-level Findings
•

•

Almost 340,000 people live near bus stops of routes with major service changes. BIPOC populations are
represented at slightly lower shares of the population than district averages (35.14%). However, lowincome populations are represented by nearly 12 percentage points higher than the district average
(25.8%) and those within block groups of major service changes represent 64% of the district’s lowincome population (BIPOC populations within the block groups with major service increases represent
44% of the district’s BIPOC population.)
When considering the proposed service increases for the nearly 1.48 million people within the block
groups that include the route’s stops and as a proportion to the district overall, BIPOC populations
stand to benefit less compared to non-BIPOC populations. Above-average BIPOC population
areas received 6.85% less of a benefit compared to non-BIPOC areas. The difference was below the
disparate impact threshold by 1.77%; therefore, a potential systemwide disparate impact was
found. Low-income populations received 22.86% more benefit than non-low-income
populations. The difference was 26.98% above the threshold for a potential disproportionate burden;
therefore, no potential disproportionate burden was found with the proposed service increase.

Next Steps for Potential Disparate Impacts and Disproportionate Burden
Findings
Given a potential disparate impact or disproportionate burden, RTD will evaluate whether there is an alternative
that would serve the same objectives and with a more equitable impact. Otherwise, RTD will either:
a) Alter the service proposal to avoid, minimize, or mitigate potential disparate impacts/disproportionate
burdens, or
b) Provide a substantial legitimate justification for keeping the proposal as-is and show that there are no
alternatives that would have a less disparate impact on BIPOC riders or disproportionate burden on lowincome customers but would still accomplish the project or program goals.
Although four major service changes resulted in a potential disparate impact and a system-level disparate impact
finding, RTD recommends proceeding with the May 2025 service plan as proposed. This decision is based on the
substantial legitimate justification of implementing these improvements in alignment with the Board-approved
System Optimization Plan as well as the lack of practical alternatives to avoid, minimize, or mitigate these
impacts.
The proposed service plan offers significant overall benefits to customers, with notable advantages for BIPOC
customers, even if they may not benefit as much from the major service changes as other groups. Of the nine
major service changes (out of 35 total), all serve low-income communities, and four specifically serve BIPOC
communities. Additionally, route-level analysis indicates minimal Title VI concerns, with benefit differences of
0.16%, 0.67-0.68%, 0.55-0.75%, and 0.19% per route.
Further, several service improvements that do not meet the major service change threshold will enhance ontime performance for 14 bus routes and six rail lines, increase service on the N Line, and implement five individual
SOP initiatives. Since these changes represent service increases, they benefit all RTD customers, including BIPOC
and low-income individuals. As a result, the major service changes do not raise concerns about the inequitable
distribution of benefits.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
May 2025 Service Change

March 12, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
March 25, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the May 2025 Service Change as revised and summarized in
Attachment A and to authorize the General Manager and CEO or her designee to execute contract
amendments as necessary for private operators impacted by the service changes.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Fred Worthen, Assistant General Manager, Bus Operations
Jessie Carter, Senior Manager, Service Development
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
In alignment with the service change and work shift selection process detailed in the Collective
Bargaining Agreement (CBA) between RTD and the Amalgamated Local Transit Union (ATU) Local 1001,
the May 2025 Service Change proposal facilitates opportunities for Service Development Division staff
to adjust the operations plan for RTD’s transit network and Operations Department personnel to select
new work assignments.
DISCUSSION
Considering the current staffing levels, operators in training, and anticipated attrition, the May 2025
service change recommendations were designed with careful consideration toward staff availability. The
recommendations are centered on continued System Optimization Plan (SOP)/Comprehensive Operations
Analysis (COA) implementation, the restoration of services and system capacity, seasonal adjustments,
and improving system performance and reliability by way of service enhancements, reductions, and
adjustments.
The May 2025 service change recommendation contains several SOP/COA-related increases and
optimizations. Among the more notable changes are:
•
•
•
•
•

Increases to service frequency on Route 16 – West Colfax
Increases to midday service frequency on Route 73 – Quebec Street
Increases to service frequency on Route 153 – Chambers Road
Reintroduction of the Free Metro Ride 18th/19th Street service
Extension of service to the Willoughby Corner development via Routes 225 and DASH (nonSOP/COA)

Packet Pg. 199

16.F

In alignment with RTD’s 2021-2026 Strategic Plan, relating most directly to Customer Excellence, and
recognizing the agency’s people power availability, the proposals herein are directed at improving ontime performance, maintaining compliance with RTD’s CBA with the ATU Local 1001, and adjusting
service levels to match ridership demand.
The Board-adopted guidance for proposed service changes continues to be:
• Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards
• The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets
• The availability of alternative services to affected riders
• Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible
• Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also, disparate effects on low income and minority populations
• Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
The service changes summarized below are further detailed in Attachment A.
Summary of Public Outreach
Between February 13 and March 6, 2025, RTD held a public comment period for community input
regarding the May 2025 recommended service changes. Public meetings were held via Zoom (virtual).
Additionally, an updated feedback process was employed to collect customer input by impacted route or
line. Written communications, survey data, and public comments collected during this public comment
period have been summarized and listed in Attachments F and G of this report.
Revisions to Preliminary Modifications
Staff receives input during the public comment process and continues to conduct additional analysis
after the initial service modifications are communicated to the Board. Depending on the outcome of the
public comment process and continued analysis, staff may recommend additional revisions to these
initial modifications. The following modifications have been added or significantly revised:
Route 16 – West Colfax: to be amended in the SOP, service frequency increased from 15 to 10 minutes
during midday and p.m. peak periods.
Route 93L – North Colorado Boulevard Limited: schedule adjustments to improve connections with the N
Line at Thornton Crossroads – 104th Station.
L Line – 30th/Downing to 16th/Stout: schedule adjustments to improve on-time performance,

Outlook
Re: C-Line

Thank you for feedback. I will add it to our records and pass it along to rail team lead.

Thank you,
Krystle

Subject: C-Line
I am writing to request that the C-Line from downtown Littleton to Union Station and back, be reinstated
during the May 2025 changes.
I moved to Denver in 2021 and chose to live downtown across the street from Union Station on Wewatta
St.
I moved from a suburban city south of Houston, TX. and was excited for all of the transportation options
downtown Denver has to offer.
I am a 66yo female senior citizen who is not yet retired. I enjoy commuting to and from downtown
Littleton as often as I can to visit friends and coworkers.

Attachment: Attachment F - Public Comment (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

Hello Roseann,

I do not want to drive my own car. I do not feel comfortable changing from the light rail to the free Mall
ride bus at the end of the C-Line route at California St., especially at night.
Please consider reinstating direct access to and from downtown Littleton to Union Station via the C-Line.
Thank you,
Roseann Drake

Hi my name is Eric Mannino, I would like to see route 403 be restored to service for the May 2025 service
changes with hourly service on weekdays from 5 AM till 11 PM with Saturday service from 6 AM till 10 PM
and Sunday service from 7 AM till 9 PM is because i used to take it pre COVID so did other people. I also
would like to see the full implementation of SOP route 483 for the May 2025 service changes is because I
take that route and I see ridership trending upwards for that full SOP implementation of that route to
happen. Lastly I would like to see the full SOP implementation of route 24 for the May 2025 service
changes is because there are people who may want to take that route along the split 24 route. I would like
all of my comments that I wrote to you be on the public records.
Thank you

Hello,
I am writing to request that the C line be reinstated during the May 2025 changes. I live in downtown
Littleton, and having a route from Littleton directly to Union Station would make getting to downtown
Denver easier, particularly for games and events at Ball Arena and Coors Field, and reduce my cost and
time to get to the airport.
Having this direct line to downtown would be very useful and well utilized for me and other Littleton
residents who are lacking this access.
Thank you!

Reinstate C Line During May 2025 Changes

I live in the South Suburban area and am writing to request that the C line be reinstated during the May
2025 changes. Having a route from Littleton directly to Union Station would make getting to downtown
Denver easier, encourage mass transit to events at Ball Arena or Coors Field, and reduce my cost and
time to get to the airport.

Reinstate the C Line

I would like to request that the C line be reinstated during the May 2025 changes. The Littleton route to Union Station would not
only make getting into downtown easier and cheaper for riders, but would also reduce congestion drivingi into the city. Littleton
residents also need easier access to the airport via the C route and Union Station.
Thank you so much,

C line service to Union Station

I am Patrick, a 27yo resident in JeffCo near Clement Park for the last 5 years. I am writing concerning
service for the Littleton-Mineral branch of the light rail. Specifically about the re-opening of service
along the old C line to Union Station. I heard about these emails from another friend who
independently is trying to generate support for this, so I thought I would add my own thoughts as
well.
As it stands today, from Littleton only the downtown loop, Union Station, and the I-25/Littleton
corridors are accessible with only 1 transfer. Excluding the R and L lines which serve different
purposes, residents in every other corridor have access to the majority of the light rail network with 1
transfer at Union Station (including the FreeMallRide for downtown destinations). With 15 or 30min
train frequency, necessitating additional transfers has a very noticeable effect on overall transit times
and therefore decreases the appeal of transit for many destinations.
For this reason, even if only 1 line could be operated I would prefer a C line to Union Station over the
current D line. DCPA and downtown would remain accessible by transferring once to H or using the
FreeMallRide, while access to many other destinations in the broader network is greatly accelerated
(Ball Arena, Empower Field, Coors Field, Airport, etc).
Personally, the biggest effect for me would be faster and more reliable access to the airport. The
southwest direction is one of the furthest from the airport, which makes the drive quite long and
unpleasant. Even despite the two transfers and over double the time to get there I have chosen light
rail from Littleton-Mineral over driving/Uber because it is a more pleasant ride. I believe the more that
can be done to reduce the trip duration and simplify that trip, the more attractive it could become to
even more SW/Littleton residents. Going straight from C to A would also limit any compounding
effects of delays/missed transfers increasing the reliability of arriving close to the intended time, which
is very important when trying to ensure you make a flight on time.

Attachment: Attachment F - Public Comment (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

Hello,

I will also note that in my experience using trains to access the airport, I have multiple times found that
the E line arrives too close to the A line departure such that I end up watching the A line train leave
while trying to walk the couple blocks between the platforms. This then adds another 15 mins of
waiting to the overall trip. So even if a direct line is not feasible, if there is anything that can be done
to the timetables to give a bigger buffer between E arrivals and A departures to smooth that transfer
that would also have a big impact.
Thank you for your consideration,

ELAINE
Brandon, it's Lane. Good to see you.
Hey, awesome news on the 225 and service to Willoughby. So we're excited to see that
and hope that um helps get more ridership on that. And, you know, because I'm obliged to
say this every time I'm disappointed there's not service to Boulder Junction. I'm hoping
that will come up on the next service board change.
BRANDON
Jessie, you're muted.
JESSIE
Yeah, I need my glasses to hear as well. I should say that it is in our plans at this point in
time are to extend service on the AB2 along with I believe it's FF4 as of September So we
weren't able to get it in this time, but we are looking to do that in September, Elaine.
ELAINE
That's exciting news. And do you think this station would be opening or
JESSIE
We're in the we're in the process of getting that ready now. I've taken a visit up there
with a number of other personnel as well. So we're making sure that everything is up to
snuff as far as signage and doors working and everything. So yes, I do believe the station
will be open and ready to go at that point.
ELAINE
That's exciting. Thank you.
ERIC MANNINO
Hey, I have a question too, Jesse. When are you guys going to reinstate a 403?

Attachment: Attachment F - Public Comment (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

ERIC MANNINO
Specifically, my name is Eric. My comments are to… Add the 403 to the SOP and
reinstate it to service, like you said you would, due to de-Brucing of Tabor restrictions.
Another comment they have. Run to 43 for the SOP on weekends, please.
My last but not least comment is please secure funding to extend the D-line service to
Highlands Ranch C470 and Lucent.

JESSIE
You know, Eric, I'm not sure that the 403 was on the list
ERIC MANNINO
Please make it on the list, please. There's people who want to ride it. And I used to ride it
all the time. Yes, please.

Okay, the 403 Wildcat reserve Okay, I'll take a look at that. Eric. Can you leave your

Okay, where's the chat at, Jesse? I don't know where chat's at.

BRANDON
There is no… no chat, but there is the Q&A. So on the very bottom navigation bar, third
from the right, there's a little box that says Q&A with a question mark, you can drop your
ERIC MANNINO
Well, the next thing I want to talk about is the… D-line extension of C470 loose ends.
JESSIE
Right. I have that down.
BRANDON
Yep, we have that noted.
ERIC MANNINO
Okay, when it's going to be funded?
JESSIE
It's not something that's in the cards right now. And again, if you can leave me your
telephone number, I can call you and give you more information on that.

going to run it on weekends for the SOP?
JESSIE

Packet Pg. 223

16.F.f

Well, you know, as we're basically at this point in time adding things in as there's the
opportunity. In other words, where our resources allow Also, we're taking into
consideration the ridership on a given route, to make sure that it's something that we
expect to do well from day one.

ERIC MANNINO
Okay, thank you. 2026 it is. You mean January 2026?
JESSIE
No, I meant, sometime in 2026. My crystal ball was broken a long time ago.
So again, I have to look at what resources are available at that time and whether or not it
makes sense and can be tied in with other service changes so it won't be in, I would say
that it won't be placed or considered prior to
January 2026.
ERIC MANNINO
Okay, thank you. Well, another thing I talk about is the 483 three because there are
people who went back and I used to write it went before it was suspended.
JESSIE
Yeah, the 403, I'm going to say it's one of the very few routes that we still currently
operate 30 foot buses or have operated 30 foot buses on. Its ridership was below seven
persons per hour. And we will struggle to consider the Route 403 coming back.
ERIC MANNINO
Oh, that's a bummer. I need it back. Maybe in September. Can't do a study of the 403
comeback, please.
JESSIE
We'll take a look at it, but I can't make any promises based on his previous performance.
ERIC MANNINO
Okay, you can call my number back if you have any questions, Jesse.
Is it okay if I join tomorrow's ask a service plan session?

Attachment: Attachment F - Public Comment (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

So, the 483, given its current performance, and it's not that great, I have to say.
Is a lower priority at this point So it's not something I would expect in the coming service
change as far as September is concerned but It's something to be considered for 2026.

JESSIE
Absolutely.

Oh, the R line to Ridgegate. Is again another one of those current ridership doesn't
necessarily support. It's something we will have to consider in the future as more is
developed around Ridge Gate.

At rtd-denver.com slash service dash alerts slash service dash changes You can also just
go to rtd-denver.com and search May service changes and it'll pop right up.
You can contact our customer care line at 303-299-6000 to provide your public comment
there. You can attend one of our additional meetings such as Ask a Service Planner, which
is taking place tomorrow at 5.30. Online or attend the board of directors meetings You
can join us at a community event or send an email to service.change at rtd-denver.com.
I will quickly go over the timeline. For the service changes. Customers can provide public
comment through close of business March 6th, which is this upcoming Thursday.
On March 12th, the proposed changes and comments will be shared with the Operations
Safety and Security Committee of the Board of Directors. And the board of directors will
review all of the public comments and take action on March 25th.
And if approved, the service changes would go into effect on May 25th.
ERIC MANNINO
Okay when it's going to be approved by the way. March 25th would be when the board
decides whether to approve the service changes or not. Okay, what about… I have a
question about the Operation Safety and Security Committee about… If you're going to
regard my comments on the 403.
JESSIE
They would have access to your comments. They will be provided to them.
ERIC MANNINO
Okay, how many people would need it? I told there are people who want to 403 back
JESSIE
Yep, we have that comment down. So we will be sure to relay that to them.
And it's not about a number of people necessary. So it's not like something you throw or
put together on a signature list or anything, it is about more about how the service has is
performed and the population density and land use in the area. It's not like we're trying
something new or that has not been there. We are making the decisions based on what
we know about the route past performance.

My comment is… The 35 should be extended back to midnight like it was pre-pandemic
because you still got people commuting. From downtown that have to get the 31 to go to
Evans and Federal, so that way it makes it easier for them to get home to and from. And
the other thing is, too, I'm glad that the 35 has been extended.
ALEXA
Hi, thank you so much for having me. I am a huge fan of public transportation, and I
recently relocated to Little in August of 2024, and I specifically chose the apartment
where I live because of its proximity to the C line. You can imagine my surprise and
disappointment when I emailed RTD to ask what happened to the C line and I found out it
was taken away due to the low ridership during the pandemic. Aside from the fact that I
think using pandemic data to justify a cancellation of an entire service is a little bit silly, it
also is detrimental to many opportunities for both the city of Littleton and the city of
Denver. Oftentimes I don't end up taking public transportation nowadays. Because of the
lack of a direct line to Coors Field, Ball Area. It’s an easy transfer to the airport. When I go
home to see my family, if I were to take public transportation, it would end up taking me
about an hour and a half.

Just via the trains and the purses, so I am… expressing my feedback and the fact that I'm
extremely in favor of the C line, I think it would promote ridership via Decreasing
congestion on the highways. And it would discourage dangerous behaviors like drinking
and driving because a lot of the bars and young people my age that tend to go out would
want to commute back to the suburbs because that's where we live.

Attachment: Attachment F - Public Comment (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

RICHARD BAMBER
Hi, good evening, everybody. Hope you guys are all okay. Very high-level comment from
me tonight.

But I would very much respectfully like to remind the Service Development Division this
time that They have a part to do in turning this around. We must increase ridership. We
have put it, sorry, we have lobbied the directors to put it in the GM and CEO's goals We
are going to be highlighting it. It is the thing that really makes RTD. It justifies RTD's
existence.
So, I encourage the service development team to massively think through their scheduling
decisions. Do those transfers work? Are they three minutes? Do they show up on the next
ride? Do they show up on the transit apps? Does the product look attractive to use?
Because especially in a cold evening, waiting at one of our rail stations for a bus that could
have been scheduled three minutes later and I now have to wait 27 minutes is very much
an unattractive thing, so absolutely disrespectful reminder and
We do like the new sort of commenting process, and we'll be feeding in line by line
comments using that process. Thank you very much.
Chat Participant
Can you post the actual schedule adjustments when they are made. We can't give
thoughts on the adjustments without knowing what exactly is changing with the
schedule.
REBECCA
As a Littleton resident, I would like to ditto what Alexa said about the C line.

Attachment: Attachment F - Public Comment (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

You know we the public last year elected directors to care to run on a number of things,
but ridership is the big one. I'm not sure if you guys have seen the numbers that came
out, but for 2024 but they're not particularly good. You know, RTD just put 0.1% increase
in ridership You know, we're 62% of our ridership pre-pandemic other agencies in the
West are far higher okay now there's a number of reasons for that you know number of
factors.

So in the servicing proposal for the D line, it says minor changes to the schedule, reason to improve

Simulated one for the H line, but nothing for the L line.
0:46
So is the L schedule unaffected?
0:51
It should be included.
0:55
Now I got to go look at our service change 'cause I did make a small modification to the L line
because the operators are running proposed May 25 and I know I saw it when I proofed things.
1:29
Well, that's special because I did actually take a minute off the L line because they're arriving at 20th
and Welton anywhere from 1:00 to 2:00 minutes early, depending on how quickly they can get
through the loop, or at least that was proposed.

4:43
I meant to put the outline in there as well.
4:50
So I'm sorry.
4:51
We can go back to your question.
4:54
Sure, OK.
4:55
I was just curious what sort of adjustments primarily it's just in a few areas where I just need to shift a
few seconds one way or another.
5:07
Because even before we had to do the track maintenance that we've been doing that instituted all
these slow zones, light rail seem to be averaging like the high 80s.
5:16
And you know, our service performance goals are usually in the 90s for the night rail.
5:22
So it's just a a few minor changes to the schedule.

Attachment: Attachment F - Public Comment (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

4:17
There's no full list.

5:26
Yeah, OK.

And I saw that the Metro ride Metro ride was coming back, but I haven't seen anything about like this
summer, any of the the the phases 2-3 and four of the yeah, we were, we were hoping to be ready for

6:29
All right, is there are there plenty to do all all of the remaining phases that at once or is it just going to
be phase two or I don't know if the team fails?
6:41
I'm so sorry.
6:43
I'm they're still in the process of getting the contractor and it's a design build no proposal.
6:52
So and that's they haven't I say yet.

I'm OK today.
8:24
So I was told you had a question and I'm sorry something about all about the fleece.
8:31
Yes, correct.
8:35
So typically I I guess I need more specific like what what do you mean as far as I want, I want the three
foot all three foot buses go to transit of Angkor because there's no low ratio buses and Longmont.
8:50
That's why, well, we are trying to assign all of our 30 footers to Longmont right now because
Longmont is one of those few areas where only 30 foot buses will actually fit on most of the street
network there.

Packet Pg. 232

16.F.f

9:10
Why not put 40 foot butters instead all 40 foot butters instead?
9:15
The 40 foot buses cannot navigate any of the turns on the current routing for any of the 300 routes in
Longmont.

9:24
OK.
9:24
So Argos sent all those 30 footers to Longmont by May probably.
9:34
I mean we're trying to retire them, so I don't know if we're buying more 30 foot buses.
9:41
Oh, I thought you was standing from Transdiv Angkor to Transdev Longmont.
9:47
They might.
9:48
I think I used to see 30 footers on the route 35 maybe or 30 O35.
9:56
It's not 30 footer anymore.
9:57
They're 40 footers.
9:59
OK, well then I'm assuming that Transdev Inglewood, they've probably either moved their buses from
there to Longmont or they had to retire those buses.

Attachment: Attachment F - Public Comment (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

9:23
Oh, I didn't know that.

10:08
Actually, actually there's there's actually new style, there's New York T local 30 foot buses.
10:15
Now I'm not familiar with them because last I knew RTD was trying to get away from the 30 foot buses
'cause it hold as many people as a regular 40 foot bus.

10:55
I'm sorry, I didn't understand the question what I'm trying to just tell 12 30 footers in Transdev
Anklewood, trying to retire them all.
11:03
I believe the intention is eventually they will be retired.
11:06
Yeah, I don't think they're planning to replace them with 30 footers.
11:12
OK.

I'm Yeah, I would imagine once construction is finished that those whatever bus stops are affected by
construction will be reopened.

Attachment: Attachment F - Public Comment (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

13:02
OK, so it looks like according to the SOP, we will expand the span of service on the weekends.

13:54
OK.
13:55
Well, I hope, yeah, we hope all the 30 fours can move to Longmont.

Packet Pg. 236

16.F.f

14:08
Yeah, we're.
14:09
So if we we can have the the person who is responsible for fleet reach out to you and answer that
question.

14:21
I'll probably be available tomorrow.
14:22
Who should I call for the fleet manager?
14:25
So Tegan, I wouldn't need to find out who it is exactly.
14:30
I know who it used to be, but we've had some shifting of staff, so I need to.
14:36
I will e-mail them your contact information to call you.
14:40
OK.
14:40
But I'm not available.
14:41
Tonight's a problem.
14:43
It would, it would be probably tomorrow.

Attachment: Attachment F - Public Comment (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

14:18
Well, OK, but I'm not available for us tonight.

14:45
Yeah, probably.
14:47
Well, I hope the full 3 be restored.
14:49
Will be restored to the service for the SOP, maybe added for the SOP.

Packet Pg. 237

16.F.f

14:53
Full 3.
14:57
Are you talking are you saying 403 route?

15:01
I don't know, I don't see that on here for SOP and I'm not familiar with that route.
15:07
It might have been a route before my time at RTD.
15:10
Actually it was a route before COVID.
15:13
OK.
15:13
So we discontinued it just before COVID.
15:18
I thought you guys wanted to keep the four O 3 bus line and suspended during COVID.
15:24
I would have to look at the SOP, but well it says it says it wasn't including the SOP, but it might come
back after the SOP.
15:36
I would we could add Dan to the group that was his route.
15:40
OK, can you please add Dan to OK, I'll leave and ask Dan or somebody from West team to come over.

Attachment: Attachment F - Public Comment (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

14:59
Yes.

15:46
Sam.
15:47
OK, OK.
16:01
Thanks for taking.

Packet Pg. 238

16.F.f

16:03
Sure.
16:06
So I had a couple questions on the D line and H line.

16:16
I'll check my Yeah, it's just minor adjustments primarily.
16:22
I needed to shift some and add some time for the trains to get through what we call the Cascades.
16:27
So from the Aurora Colfax station to the Theater District Convention Center station, it we're still
coordinating and working with City of Denver, but the timing for the signals is not ideal.
16:45
We used to be able to go bi directionally through there and sometimes we can and sometimes we
can't.
16:53
So I'm trying to give trains a little bit more time to get through that intersection to make sure that
they can hopefully start their southbound trip on time.
17:02
So is the hope?
17:04
Yeah, that makes sense.
17:06
Does that affect the spacing in time between those trains?

Attachment: Attachment F - Public Comment (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

16:09
It looked like they're just listed for I think just minor schedule adjustments at this stage.

17:11
It does.
17:12
So when I have to add a little bit of time, it changes how everything in the entire system has to work.
17:19
So 'cause then, you know, D&H they intersect with or they are run, they share stations with the E line.

Packet Pg. 239

16.F.f

17:27
So then the E line has to shift and I have to make sure that the E line shifts around the West line 'cause
I needed to take a little bit of time off the West line outbound because my operators were running a
little early.

17:46
So there's no like, let me just add a minute here without changing the entire system pretty much for
sure.
17:52
But I, I guess with both of those lines sharing the, the downtown loop, do they still maintain like
roughly consistent spacing?
18:02
Yeah, through the through the loop, Yeah, it should be the minute and a half to three minutes for the
traffic signal timing to get through downtown.
18:12
And then the last question with those is, I'm curious why one or well both wouldn't work, but why one
of those is not combined with the L line?
18:23
It seems like that would save at least one operator per hour and lead to better align connectivity at I25 and Broadway.
18:32
I just want to understand that a little bit better.
18:35
I've proposed to combine it with something, but right now the focus is SOP.
18:43
Yeah.

Attachment: Attachment F - Public Comment (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

17:41
And, and when you change the E&H, it changes the R line.

18:44
So I'm hoping maybe with the next round of SOP that we'll be working on that I can integrate it,
especially since after the downtown rail replacement phase two, I'm hoping maybe I can reimplement
some kind of combination to absorb the Li.
19:03
Yeah, it's my help.

Packet Pg. 240

16.F.f

19:07
But, you know, I have to submit a proposal and then it has to work its way up the chain for approval.
19:11
So.

19:13
So if it's not in the SOP, it's hard to prioritize even if there would be resource savings.
19:18
Yeah, that's good to know.
19:26
Any other questions?
19:28
It's everything I had for questions.
19:30
That's it.
19:31
That's yeah, for for this round.
19:34
All right, Usually you have more questions, but OK, I I just moved so I'm I'm learning the new the new
lines around me and what to what I need to talk about them now.
19:45
OK, that's fair.
19:49
All right.

Attachment: Attachment F - Public Comment (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

19:12
Got it.

19:49
Well, then if that's good, then I guess I'll go back to the room and then you can either leave or go
back to the main room if something pops in your head for another group.
20:01
Yeah, I guess while I have you here.

Packet Pg. 241

16.F.f

20:04
Yeah, not run out of questions as far as the maintenance work goes on the.
20:12
Well, I guess on the DE and H, are any of the schedule adjustments matching what you're seeing in
real time on these lines or are you hoping that?

20:24
I'm really hoping that we continue to see improvement, especially with some of the work that we're
still doing and planning to do.
20:34
The night crews are out there nightly doing as much as they can with hand grinders and replacing and
mitigating what they can without the the big grinder machine here.
20:47
So my help is by this May run board, we're back to what was somewhat normal.
20:55
You think that fingers crossed means January 2024 timing?
21:03
Yeah, but better because I took the Jan 24 running times where we were running at like 80, mid 80s,
high 80s and used that data to inform May to hopefully get us closer to the 90% on time
performance.
21:18
Yeah, it's my help.
21:22
Well, it seems like we have fewer dropped runs now than we did in in January of last year.
21:26
So that's hopefully meaning that better on time plus more continued fewer drop runs will be really
nice.

Attachment: Attachment F - Public Comment (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

20:21
We'll continue to see improvement on trip times.

21:35
I mean, I, I'm always seeing students out there, so I I'm assuming your recruiting is going better.
21:42
Yeah, that's good news.

Packet Pg. 242

16.F.f

21:44
Yeah, Yeah.
21:46
And then one positive comment.

21:53
That seemed like a a very welcome addition.
21:56
Yeah, it, it was requested a lot, but it's really hard to support it when there were only like 30 people.
22:03
So once we got up to like 90 boardings, that allows me to add the additional trip.
22:08
Yeah, you have to see that in the, I guess what previously would have been the second or last trip.
22:13
Would that be a 1056?
22:15
Yeah.
22:20
Oh, sorry, I do have one more question.
22:22
I just didn't write this one down on my list.
22:26
A lot of the frequency improvements have been really nice to see.

Attachment: Attachment F - Public Comment (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

21:48
I just enjoyed seeing the late Friday trip on the end line.

22:30
And talking with Jesse about the 16, it sounded like it hit the threshold to go to 10 minute frequencies
on boardings per hour.
22:39
And given that, I'm really curious why the A line, which seems like it's well above the boardings per
hour threshold that you would need for 10 minute frequencies is still running at 30 minutes in the
evenings.

Packet Pg. 243

16.F.f

22:51
So that's where working with a concessionaire who runs the A line is different.
23:02
Any kind of changes to the schedule as far as frequency or changing the timing requires negotiations
of the concessionaires agreement.

23:27
The weekends is the main area where the boardings per hour threshold is met.
23:32
And so by adding a car, we can put off the increasing frequency.
23:40
I would like to increase frequency, but it's not going to be cheap.
23:43
Yeah, yeah, just seems hard to watch the Pena, Pena Blvd.
23:49
widening studies knowing that there's at least a short term solution available if we're willing to spend
the money and remember to, to pitch in.
24:00
But no, no, I'll, I'll remain hopeful that we can at least go to 15 on, on some of those.
24:06
Yeah, 15 I think is the most frequent that you could do because it is single track right now from 40th
and Airport to Pena and then between Pena and Denver airport, from 48th and airport all the way to
the airport.
24:24
Is, is that 100% on airport property?

Attachment: Attachment F - Public Comment (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

23:14
And at the time, right now we're meeting the need by taking adding additional cars to those trains in
the evening on the weekends.

24:28
It's not RTD, no, I, I don't know the exact.
24:38
I wasn't here for the planning and design of all that.
24:40
So I'm not familiar with all of the boundaries, but I think a good share of it is mostly airport property.

Packet Pg. 244

16.F.f

24:48
Yeah, I, I dug in a while back on how the, I can't remember the, the name for them, but the fees that
the airport is allowed to charge airlines, which is capped up to, you know, single digit dollars per per
passenger basically, and how they can use that for transportation improvements.
25:06
And there seem to be this sweet spot that since so much of the single track was, looked like it was on
airport property, that they could potentially use some of that funding to improve it, even though
there's more than one stop.

Attachment: Attachment F - Public Comment (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

25:19
Maybe.
25:20
I haven't looked into it.
25:21
Yeah.
25:22
That's something to pressure the airport on, though.
25:25
Yeah.
25:26
Reach out to Phil Washington.
25:33
But I have one just very general question too.
25:35
If you still have time when you're when we're talking about boardings per hour, is that implicitly a
boardings per hour per trip?
25:44
It's not just total, total boardings on the route over a one hour period.
25:50
Does it you get normalized by like if you had one trip per hour and you know, 400 boardings in that
time span versus 2 trips per hour and 400 mornings in that time span would be called the two trips
per hour, 1200 boardings per hour?
26:10
Well, it's not really by the trip, it's by the revenue hours.

Packet Pg. 245

16.F.f

26:14
So when we're calculating it, it's you know, the length of the trip and then how many trips make up
that service divided by the boardings.
26:25
So if you double the service frequency, you're also doubling revenue hours and off run times.

26:32
OK, yeah.
26:34
So it's not necessarily always a double, but it's it depends on how the cycle time for the route works.
26:43
So you know, the cycle time is the running time from start to end, plus any dead head and layover
recovery for the operator impact cycle time that you can achieve based off of the frequency.
26:58
So yeah, like it takes 9 E lines to run the E line service.
27:04
So OK, I'll have to rework the calcs I have in my, the database I've been building.
27:15
Cause I've been looking at purely how many people get on a given route at any stop over the span of
any one hour.
27:22
And it's in, it's in the hundreds for a lot of these routes, which is not consistent with like the, the
documentation I've seen for, for how you plan things.
27:30
So I'm trying to figure out where, where I'm missing something.

Attachment: Attachment F - Public Comment (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

26:30
You are, yes.

27:33
And I, I think the, it's the fact that, you know, 12:00 PM to 1:00 PM is not one revenue hour.
27:41
It's however many revenue hours that you get by, however many vehicles are running on that route,
right?
27:48
So it's whatever your cycle time is times however many vehicles it takes.

Packet Pg. 246

16.F.f

27:52
So like the E line is for example, it's an hour each direction.
28:00
Operators take 9 minutes to turn it each direction.

28:16
So however many 9 trains times 15 minutes is and then that's that could give you a rough estimate for
revenue hours.
28:24
Yeah, that makes sense.
28:26
But they also post them online, I think on in like the finance pages when they do their financial
reports.
28:33
You could get revenue hours from there.
28:35
I haven't seen it by route other than for maybe for the the rail, but definitely not by route for buses.
28:41
OK.
28:42
That's why I've been trying to do some of my own data.
28:47
Good luck.

Attachment: Attachment F - Public Comment (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

28:03
So that's an hour plus those 18 minutes plus their layover recovery time comes to like a cycle time of
like 135 or something like that, I don't remember off the top of my head.

28:53
OK, Any more?
28:56
I think that's that's actually the last one.
28:59
OK, cool.

Packet Pg. 247

16.F.f

29:01
I'm going to go back to the big group then.
29:04
Yeah, hopefully continue to get some good questions tonight.

29:09
Thanks again for doing this.
29:11
Yeah, have a good night.
29:13
Yes, thanks.

Attachment: Attachment F - Public Comment (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

29:07
Yeah, for sure.

Packet Pg. 248

16.F.f

Ask a planner
0:02
As opposed to routes that might have some higher ridership with 15 minute frequencies as well like
the the 1:05 or certain off peak times on the 15 or 15 L?

0:19
So you probably remember back in September 23 or when we took, we did the first changes on the
16, we broke it into 16 and the 17 and we added 15 minute service frequency.
0:30
Since then, the ridership on the 16, I'm not sure if you know this or not, but the overall ridership is
showing 40 boardings per hour on the overall route, which was our former, you know, a floor for a
route receiving 10 minute frequency.
0:46
So during what I call peak direction times, we get up to 48 boardings, 48.6 boardings per hour on the
route 16.
0:56
So it is actually doing extremely well, which encourages us to increase the ridership.
1:02
And what's different about let's say the 1515 L, which the last numbers I looked at, they were in the
high 30s, They operate on higher frequencies, but they also share 1/4, right.
1:13
You might remember the 16 and 16 L, which we no longer have.
1:17
We don't have the 16 L anymore.
1:19
So with the 16, we're actually, it's not that we're doing a disservice to the corridor itself, but the
corridor could use more service and that is different than what's in the current SOP.

Attachment: Attachment F - Public Comment (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

0:14
Awesome, great, great question and I truly appreciate it.

1:30
And that's why we're asking the board to amend the current SOP for the Route 16 that ridership is, it's
doing very, very well.
1:39
Route one O 5, I'm glad you mentioned that it does deserve a higher frequency.

Packet Pg. 249

16.F.f

1:44
We'll be revisiting that again.
1:45
But you might remember also, we just changed the Route one O 5 earlier last year to the higher all
day midday frequency.

2:01
So there we think we have a little room there.
2:03
Will we be back and revisiting the Route one O 5?
2:05
I do believe so.
2:06
I think it's going to reach that 40 plus boardings per hour to be absolutely honest.
2:11
So yeah, I, I think we're, we're on the same page.
2:16
I look forward to seeing what the 16 is actually going to do at the 10 minute level.
2:21
OK.
2:21
Does that answer your questions that that does and that boardings per hour, is that something you
look at over the entire span of the route?

Attachment: Attachment F - Public Comment (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

1:53
And then we came back in January with Route 35, which shares a corridor with the Route one O 5 on
Hampden.

2:32
We can look at it.
2:33
We look at it in several different ways.
2:34
We look at it from the raw route.

Packet Pg. 250

16.F.f

2:37
So that's the old when I say overall 40, that's the score that the route must meet in order to hold on to
10 minutes service frequency for the entire route at the segment exceeds that.
2:49
We can look at it for that time period.

2:56
However, because it's the overall in their, in their non typical times in which we're exceeding the 4548
boardings per hour, it gives us all the confidence in the world to say that, OK, this makes sense to
have midday peak frequency and we we can go there and actually grow the ridership.
3:16
At the same time, when we looked at the overall balance of the of the Service plan itself, the 16 is in a
unique position in that it's a core route that's very important to transfers throughout the system and it
crosses some very meaningful or larger routes as well.
3:34
So we think that it's a pretty big benefit to the, to the network as a whole.
3:43
How do you weigh those qualitative impacts when you're comparing different routes?
3:50
Say you have two routes that both meet that 40 boardings per hour metric.
3:54
But yeah, then it comes down to opportunity.
3:57
You know, Joe, the system is a lot more complicated in terms of where we dispatch the vehicles from.
4:03
So we're looking at different divisions in different parts of town.

Attachment: Attachment F - Public Comment (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

2:51
So if let's say AM peak and PMP meets it, we can, you know, grab the 10 minute frequency.

4:06
We're looking at different contracts that we have with private carriers.
4:09
We have limitations on certain contracts.
4:11
We we have to provide a balance.

Packet Pg. 251

16.F.f

4:13
So what what provides us the best opportunity based on our workforce and the divisions that the
services are out of.

4:38
Had they also had an additional flexibility of saying, OK, we're going to go ahead and make this move
with the 16 to 10 minute frequency there with a 40 foot coach, which means I can then free up
articulated coaches and not have to think about that to reserve, you know, put in reserve for that, but
instead think about that for future changes on the federal BRT quarter.
5:01
So there there are a lot of things that go into it and that's those are the harder things to really talk
about and to kind of enumerate in a in a report.
5:10
But there are things that we have to that we would want to take advantage of when we can to lower
our cost, increase frequency and then serve the customer as best we can.
5:19
Thanks.
5:20
Yeah, I appreciate all the the detail there.
5:22
OK, What other routes did you have?
5:25
Just to make sure that there wasn't anything else for North team, The D&H, the 12 and the Metro ride.
5:36
OK, I'll take the Metro ride.

Attachment: Attachment F - Public Comment (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

4:21
And it can even go down to with their future plans, like in this case, if there are future plans to not
address things with let's say an articulated coach, which is our our longer vehicle making a move like
this.

5:39
We'll knock out all the ones.
5:40
We'll see if we can find one of our rail folks for you.
5:42

Packet Pg. 252

16.F.f

But the Metro ride, so you might remember back when we did phase one of the downtown rail
reconstruction project.
5:51
So we brought the free Metro ride back all day, this service all day as a mitigation effort to provide,
you know, more service since we are not full bore with a free mall ride still under construction and
quite frankly, it's still under construction.

6:13
But knowing that the free metro arrived was supposed to be a part of the SOP, supposed to be a
permanent part.
6:20
Looking at the ridership, what we learned is the midday just wasn't there in terms of the number of
passengers per hour during midday.
6:27
So we're bringing back in the configuration that's more consistent with what we believe will make
sense from a permanent basis.
6:36
So this isn't just a mitigation effort.
6:39
This is the permanent replacement or permanent reimplementation of the the free Metro Ride.
6:45
I see.
6:45
OK.
6:46
And with so many buses already traversing the downtown corridor between Civic Center and Union
Station, is there any reason that those existing routes can't be reconfigured to serve the same niche as
the Metro ride?

Attachment: Attachment F - Public Comment (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

6:08
So I'm we hope that September is the date that it does come back.

6:59
Not without the impacts that are expected to, you know, to the customers who are currently using
those.
7:07
So I think it's better to, and this is again, my opinion and there's certainly a world out there who may
differ in opinion, but we're trying to re establish in the downtown area.

Packet Pg. 253

16.F.f

7:17
And you, you probably know this better than than most.
7:20
That is downtown isn't what it used to be in terms of employment population.

7:35
At the same time we have this dedicated fleet, the free metro ride, you may know as a three door
articulated coach with no fare box, right.
7:43
So that's part of our fleet that isn't as flexible as as other services.
7:48
So we think the investment and putting it back in the quarter that it was built for is that we did build a
corridor the 18th and 19th area for the free, free metro ride.
7:58
We think that that's a viable quarter to stave off some other things that we we may not be able to
justify as far as reinstatement.
8:09
So you might remember, and not only I know she does.
8:12
And looking at the 120X and 122X122X actually served the southern end of downtown.
8:18
It has not been reinstated with a free metro ride that keeps us from having to, you know, to take a
look at reinstating the 122 X until you know, it's, it's until the market is, is back.
8:32
And quite frankly, Joe, I, I'm not sure that downtown is going to come back to the level of
employment population as it was prior to pandemic.

Attachment: Attachment F - Public Comment (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

7:26
So we're trying to hold on and preserve what we have as far as ridership and travel patterns that are
there and we don't want to necessarily disrupt them.

8:43
I just, I, I'm not seeing that.
8:45
And it's been, it's been five years.

Packet Pg. 254

16.F.f

8:48
It literally has been fighting.
8:49
We're coming up on five years now.

9:01
And if that's the case and if that continues, then we're going to have to modify some things.
9:04
I think the free metro ride during peak period will provide an alternative way of getting to the
southern end of downtown and the best way that we possibly can can bring it and utilizing a fleet
that, you know, if we don't use it now, we'll we'll have bought an asset that's been useless for a very
long period of time, if that makes sense.
9:28
Yeah, that does.
9:29
Thank you.
9:32
And the Route 12.
9:34
Route 12 is there's a timing issue that I believe was brought up in the public hearing process from
January and we're addressing the Route 12's connections at 30th and Blake.
9:43
So that was that is purely a timing issue.
9:45
I'm I'm super happy to see that issue get addressed.

Attachment: Attachment F - Public Comment (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

8:51
So I think we've seen growth in the downtown employment area of like 445 percent from, you know,
what it what it has been since 2020.

9:49
I was mostly curious if addressing the issue with the 38th and Blake connection will have negative
impacts on the enh line connection at Louisiana Pearl.
9:59
Yeah, I'm hoping those can be maintained.
10:01

Yeah, I'm hoping that our our biggest issues as far as I will and I'm sure you'll probably hear this from
Tegan and Clara are the work schedule.
10:08
Those that you know have to be joined in in order to cure some of the infrastructure problems that we
have right now.

10:24
Then we have overhead wire issues that will have to be addressed.
10:27
So this this comes with, I can remember when we just had the central corridor, wrote the first
operations plan for the central corridor, the first schedules.
10:38
And I can't imagine, I couldn't have imagined one being here for 30 some odd years.
10:44
But it happened.
10:45
And now the system is over 30 years old and needs some real help.
10:51
And it's we have a lot of work that needs to be done.
10:55
So there are scheduled irregularities, as you know, still out there as we do slow orders and we do
shutdowns.
11:01
And some of the shutdowns are now lasting from like 2:00 AM in the morning until about noon the
next day in order to get certain work done.

Attachment: Attachment F - Public Comment (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

10:15
As far as straightening out rail, replacing rail in some parts and milling rail where there are, you know,
rust spots or other other problems.

11:07
So I, I, I do hope that we won't ruin any connections as far as Louisiana, but we still have a lot of work.
11:14
And I do know that in the next few weeks, we are going to start working on the area between South
Moor and Broadway.
11:21
Again, a bit of work that needs to be done there.

Packet Pg. 256

11:24
So I can't guarantee anything at this point in time, but we're definitely trying to cure the issue
between the 12 at 30th and Blake.

11:50
So brace for impact and stay a customer if you can, please.
11:56
Yeah, All right.
11:59
Thanks for the detail.
12:00
Further questions.
12:02
Yeah, Thank you for for, you know, joining and asking.
12:06
We can't fix it if we don't know about it.
12:08
So we appreciate it.
12:11
Yeah.
12:11
If there's nothing else, then I'll go ahead and stop the recording for this session.

11:33
As far as the A line is concerned, for sure we're going to do our best connections and on time
performance on the the E and the and the H, But as you know, we probably have another Phase 2
coming up later this year.

12:14
We can get back into the main room.

Category: Schedule Timing
Change: Minor changes to schedule.
Reason: Improve on-time performance and service reliability.
Please expand the service area of the Ridgeline station to include Castle Pines. I am a college student at MSU
living in CP who uses the Ridgeline station to get to campus and I do not apply for in-district free parking. It would
be very financially beneficial if people in my neighborhood would apply for free parking when we have to use the
light rail everyday.
Having more reliable times for the line would be good. I also think better integration with Google maps would be
good.

How am I supposed to know if you don’t tell me what the changes are? Dumb survey.
Can there be on time ever?
Go every 20 till 7pm instead of cut off at 6:30pm for Eline.

Really tired of changes to this line. Every change causes negative impact that is unacceptable. Ever since the
COVID shutdown things have been horrible and with the last two summers of maintenance that last 6 to 9 months
before schedules are back, it is ridiculous. When are you people going to get it together. Every major city in the
US except here have a great mass transit system. What is wrong here. Fire the CEO and start a clean slate!! This
sucks you run 2 to 3 cars going downtown and it was always 4 prior to COVID. We are packed in these trains like
sardines. Stop the madness.
I'd love this to be reliable, but it hasn't been for like a year now. It will take time for me to regain trust in RTD's
timeliness.
We use this Lightrail route to go to sporting events
The on-time proposal would be great as we didn't go to the home and garden show this year because of the
inconsistency of the E line operators and the hours of operation. You can't expect people to use light rail if they
can't depend on the overall operation. Plus make sure the line is safe for us to us by RTD Police on the line
checking for tickets and behavior.
The schedule changes should either reflect the real time that it normally gets to stations, or move as quickly as
reasonably possible, while also allowing other bus routes to easily get on or depart from a rail station along the Eline.
I use this line to commute to work as a professor at MSU. Increased reliability will drastically improve my work life
balance and ability to get to class reliably and on time.
RTD needs to return to pre-covid schedules on ALL lines. E, G, and B. RTD needs to finish the FastTrax
approved B line to Boudler Longmont. AND realize that the time for maintenance is when there are no trains. Not
during the peak time for commuting!!!!!
I am happy if the E line service is not being reduced. Slow zones seem to be getting better!

Attachment: Attachment G - Survey (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

Fire the entire RTD Board and start over - clueless. !

I would have liked to have seen the actual proposed schedule change, the text provided doesn't give any
information, and now I just get to worry that my layover at union station during my commute will be longer.
It's ridiculous don't even know when the trains are actually going to be there, can't count on rtd at all to be
anywhere on time and why should we pay for passes when the drivers all let people ride for free. It's getting really
old when I barely can live and still have to pay for a pass and all these junkies and homeless people get to ride for
free everyday all day long. Rtd is pathetic and dangerous. You don't do anything about the drug use and drug
deals going on at colorado station and all stations really your security is non existent. Rtd is just all around
pathetic no wo Der nobody wants to ride and it sucks for us that have to ride it.

I used to ride E/H from university to work downtown and back every day. Starting about 8 months ago it became
so unreliable that I no longer use RTD. Trains have been 40+ minutes late compared to estimated times on the
RTD app and google maps.
no matter what times you change it to there is NEVER on an on time train. its also 15-20 minutes late which
defeats the whole purpose. the 11 train is always arrives at 1130 and so on.

The change will positively impact me if the times run in closer sync with connecting trains.
I think the main priority should be trains that do not have to sit and wait between stops because of a traffic jam in
front of them. Trains every 15 minutes is nice, but more trains doesn’t make a difference when those trains arrive
very late at their destination.
The E line is how I get to and from my job. Don't have a car so it’s important. I have been leaving my home and
arriving at work super early. If I leave when google maps says I should I’m frequently late. Sometime very late. So
reliability and on time service is very important to me and everyone who rides rtd
Not a reliable option. Bring back the F line!
Minor changes to the schedule are fine as long as the number of trains per hour remains consistent and
predictable. Especially during the morning and evening commuting times.
E line needs improved security due to violent untreated mental health patients often on the train
Please plan accordingly so we do not have construction sites scattered without a promising competition date.
It’s impossible to tell what the schedule changes are so I can’t provide feedback. It just says “minor schedule
changes”
E Line is my main source of transportation to arrive to work on time everyday.
I like the concept, but where are the details? I ride between University of Denver and union Station. NB between 7
and 7:30. SB sometime between 3:30 and 4:00. Since I can’t depend on a reliable schedule. I am forced to wait,
up to 30 minutes for a train. That is a waste of time. I would prefer to have a reliable schedule rather than more
frequent service.

Attachment: Attachment G - Survey (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

Right now the e line south gets to Colorado station early 7:02 vs 7:05 and then will leave the station early and
then sits on the track 100 yards south of the station. Why leave early just to sit on the tracks for a few min? Why
not stay at the station? The south bound slow down goes from Colorado station to just after Southmoor on the
map it only shows the slow down between Yale and Southmoor

If it means the posted times are the actual that would be great!!
Could use more E line
If you want feedback on the change, then say what the change is to the schedule on the E Line. “Minor changes”
says nothing.

If this solves the "Trip is delayed due to excessive delay". "Next 4 trains cancelled due to excessive delay", issue
on Mondays between 8 and 10 am, great. Otherwise, you're not improving anything.
I do t know what the point of this survey is if all the changes are vague promises of improvements. You should be
improving your services anyway, they are terrible.
Any reduction in schedule for the summer will impact my ability to get to work. I am riding 3 days a week now and
need to during the summer. Just when the schedule get better and you hire drivers you want to reduce it again.
Constantly changing schedules is killing ridership.

Would just like reliable lines to be able to get to work on time. Would like to go back to every 15 minutes so a late
or nonexistent train isn’t end all be all
I would like to see a guaranteed transfer or cross platform interchange between D/E lines at I-25/Broadway
(Or better yet, a peak hour 1 seat ride from Littleton to Union Station)
Need more frequent and on time trains.
In order to have an opinion, it would be helpful to see the new proposed schedule, instead of simply noting “minor
changes to schedule.” Overall, regardless of the schedule change, I really urge RTD to run larger/longer trains (I.e
three cars instead of two) during typical rush hour periods (I.e 6am-9am and 4pm-6pm) so that trains aren’t
packed during high volume periods. I’d also encourage RTD to start routinely checking for tickets while trains are
en route - I take the E Line regularly and haven’t been checked in ~5 months. I guarantee at least half of riders
aren’t consistently paying.
It would be best to know how this change will look in practice. Are goal times getting adjusted? If so, earlier or
later? For me this would affect when i leave the house. It could also impact transfers (a couple minutes later and a
small delay from maintenance would lead to missing my transfer for example)
Generally speaking though more accurate to schedule is better, so im thankful efforts are being made to make
that happen!
Sometimes I take the E after taking the Flatiron Flyer to Union Station, hopefully this means Les waiting at the
platform.

Attachment: Attachment G - Survey (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

Is there more detail somewhere beyond "minor changes to schedule"? Hard to know what the impact is otherwise

Depends on what the changes are but if the changes mean the train will show up at the time wits supposed to
and makes it to where it's supposed to on time and is a line that makes sense for workers that work downtown
commuting from Littleton then yes that seems positive (again nothing is provided on what the actual change is) bring back the direct train from downtown Littleton to Union station
More frequent service would be great
I appreciate that almost all of the speed restrictions have been lifted. I’ve experienced improved service.
Can you be more specific? The description is not helpful at all trying to understand how this will impact me - I
understand it’s minor, but is it just when the train is coming, or is it the headway? Just provide more details please

Keep the 15 minute frequency. Appreciate the recent work with reducing slow zones, every 15 minutes is such a
benefit over every 30.
I regularly ride the 24 to catch the E line, but I am never able to ride the 24 back home because the schedules
don’t overlap well. I hope these changes will give me an easier commute after work.
Positive if it actually improves on time performance.

Can the 15 minute frequency for the E Line be extended later? Currently it only goes to 5:30/6pm. This is still
within rush hour. If 15 minute headways were maintained till 7 or 8 it would make it much more useful in the
summer, especially with longer stretches of daylight.
How can anyone comment when the exact timing issue isn’t disclosed??? A minor change by RTD could be once
an hour service. Absurd that there is no full disclosure especially with the poor track record of Rtd.
Make it more frequent in the morning please and on time.
I go between work and classes at MSU Denver and being able to submit schedules to my work so they know my
availability would drastically improve my quality of life
The details say there are minor changes but it does not specify what those changes are so how do I know
whether it impacts me or not?
All of the rail and BRT lines should be given priority over everything else, especially right now. Finish the BRT
lines ASAP, so we can get the remainder of the changes for these rail lines completed, and service times
increased to potentially 10 minute intervals vs 15 even, especially along the N, W, H, D, F, & E lines respectively.
Any change to improve reliability without affecting frequency will be helpful
The light rail needs to run later on weekends and on any Colorado game day. And any concert nights. I like taking
the light rail but if go to a concert we have to uber home Becasue the e line does not go late enough.
Reliability and frequency will make my commute quicker and consistent for transfers. I have not used rtd because
it’s not reliable.

Attachment: Attachment G - Survey (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

If it really improves on time performance and service reliability it will be great. I've been very frustrated by
unreliable for the past year.

I would rather you have the train tracks fully fixed and have operators to staff all routes before making any
changes. To me those items are more important before anything else.
The schedule timing needs to be a little bit better
It would be much appreciated if Southbound D & E line trips would resume the practice of scheduling back-toback arrival at I-25/Broadway station and pausing to allow for riders to transfer between the lines.
There are no details about the actual changes so it’s not possible to know how these will impact me and my
ridership. Please make the changes easier to find. Don’t just say what you’re changing, say how you’re changing.
For example, RTD say, “minor changes to schedule,” without giving a list of what those changes are.

The biggest issue is that E departs outside of it’s posted service window, often early. If it says it’s leaving at X
time, that should be the earliest it departs at. If it arrives early, it should wait until it’s scheduled departure. It’s
been great that it’s running every 15 again.

I am a proponent for the C line returning. If you are looking to increase ridership, provide The SW communities
with direct service to sporting events, LoDo entertainment venues and a direct connect to the A line. Anyone
traveling to DIA switching at the Broadway station w/a suitcase won’t feel safe hanging out at the Broadway
station w/o security. I don’t understand how RTD will increase ridership 30% w/o returning the C line which was
pulled during the pandemic. Have you surveyed the SW communities about the C line service? How was ridership
summer 2024?

make sure rail changes are communicated and light rail is on time. Needs during rush hour every 15 minutes.
Run shuttle buses to 18th and Curtis.
This line has been very unreliable recently. During construction when the d line was redirected it was nice that
there was a line that there was a train that went directly to Union. I wish rtd would reintroduce a train that goes
from mineral station to Union. It would be awesome if they planned ahead for events like Rockies games or other
sporting events

The changes will positively impact me if they are timed better with other trains. For example, I don't have to wait
for 15 or 20 minutes on the southbound Broadway platform at night in the bitter cold after stepping off a
southbound e train. Allow these trains to run until 1AM since a lot of people are returning home super late after a
concert gets out. Since the C train is gone, those of us returning from downtown to Littleton have to take the
southbound E or H train In order to catch the southbound D train. I got out of the Rolling Stones concert well after
11PM last July and was lucky to get back to Littleton on one of the last trains. That experience made me feel like
RTD is unreliable for concerts if it's going stop service at 12 midnight. RTD should be running trains until 1AM on
nights of big concerts at Empower Field or Ballerina. There's really not another affordable alternative.

D line should go to Union Station so that riders can connect to other lines
Please organize accordingly so we do not have construction sights scattered through downtown with unpromised
dates of completion.
Please keep them on time! They have been so unreliable for a year
Could be more consistent
Wtf are the changes?
Anything you can do to improve reliability. Special event schedules are an absolute mystery. What games count?
What holidays count? The website is impossible to navigate and the light up signs are wrong half the time and
only provide limited information
Any reduction in schedule for the summer will impact my ability to get to work. I am riding 3 days a week now and
need to during the summer. Just when the schedule get better and you hire drivers you want to reduce it again.
Constantly changing schedules is killing ridership.
Things have finally been on time and consistent for the D line, please don't make any drastic changes!
Please bring back the C line
I would like to see a guaranteed transfer or cross platform interchange between D/E lines at I-25/Broadway

Attachment: Attachment G - Survey (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

Would be nice if there were better connections to get into Union Station from Mineral. Timing is always off going
north and the E doesn’t run all that often. Better yet, bring back the C line!

(Or better yet, a peak hour 1 seat ride from Littleton to Union Station)
Please have this line go all the way to union station!
Whatever the changes are they need to line up the northbound D and OB arrival to Englewood station better. The
OB is always late and the train transfer is missed because of it.
Please do not change the timing of the 5:40am train. It is used by many commuters who start work between 6am6:30am. It allows us to end our day and get on the train before it is crowded with students at the CCD/Auraria
campus

As long as the trains go faster than 10mph by the time the fall semester of school comes around it won’t affect
me. My first semester all the construction started two weeks into the school year which disrupted my travel and
made the light rail unreliable. If it’s done over the summer and doesn’t effect school travel it only benefits me.
Depends on what the changes are but if the changes mean the train will show up at the time wits supposed to
and makes it to where it's supposed to on time and is a line that makes sense for workers that work downtown
commuting from Littleton then yes that seems positive (again nothing is provided on what the actual change is)

Of well over a year I have made attempts to use the D line to get to work downtown however due to the
inconsistencies in schedule and lack of service I have stopped trying. Just takes entirely too long to get to work.
Not to mention the crowding with the college stop and insufficient trains to accommodate those crowds.
The times need to be improved. Especially the late night times. The line should not stop running at 8pm and
strand people.
rtd timing sucks
Your handling. of the maintenance on this line has been horrible and caused me to stop using RTD. It has been
really frustrating and beyond incompetent on RTDs part.
It would be helpful for the E line to arrive at Broadway close to the time the D line drops off at Broadway. I am a
single woman and sometimes I am the only woman waiting for the E line at the Broadway stop to go to Union
Station; others appear to be homeless men during the week. I greatly miss the C line direct from Littleton to Union
Station; the Broadway station always makes me uncomfortable unless there is a security guard there. One time I
was waiting at Broadway on a Sunday and a man who did not seem in his right mind came up to me and started
unzipping his pants. I moved to another location at the station. Friends of mine (women) refuse to ride the trains
because of safety concerns; I have continued to use the trains in spite of the issues but am cautious.
Make sure when going southbound people can make a connection between the e line, and the d line along with
good implementation of the zero
Sure miss the direct train from Littleton to union station. Don’t go to union anymore, I used to enjoy taking the
train.
Bring the C Line back! Even if it would run every 1/2 hr, it would be better than nothing. The Southwest corridor is
being shortchanged. The parking lots used to be so full, it was hard to find a spot. Being back the C Line and
downtown will definitely benefit from the increased patronage.

Attachment: Attachment G - Survey (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

Having on time trains and not having randomly missing trains would be a huge improvement

As long as it doesn't increase the time between trains, just adjusting the times it runs and is posted on the app
correctly. That would be ok.
RTD changed in January the schedule so what now needs to be updated??
All of the rail and BRT lines should be given priority over everything else, especially right now. Finish the BRT
lines ASAP, so we can get the remainder of the changes for these rail lines completed, and service times
increased to potentially 10 minute intervals vs 15 even, especially along the N, W, H, D, F, & E lines respectively.

Curious about the proposed changes for transfer reasons.
You also need to consider having the 0 have a 7 minute headway and the 0B have a 15 minute headway.
If the train schedule is disrupted, it would be nice if the RTD app and the digital sign at the station showed an
accurate ETA for when the next train is coming. It is frustrating when the app/signage indicates a train is coming in
the next ten minutes, and then a train never comes, so it just skips to the next scheduled train. If I need to wait
thirty minutes, it is helpful to know that outright.

It would be much appreciated if Southbound D & E line trips would resume the practice of scheduling back-toback arrival at I-25/Broadway station and pausing to allow for riders to transfer between the lines.
There are no details about the actual changes so it’s not possible to know how these will impact me and my
ridership. Please make the changes easier to find. Don’t just say what you’re changing, say how you’re changing.
For example, RTD say, “minor changes to schedule,” without giving a list of what those changes are.
Make sure that D line trains align with E line squedule for better transfer to union station
I would like to see the implementation of a C line to Union station again, or perhaps alternate the D lines so that
every other train on the South-west alignment can function as a “C”. I believe having a route from mineral/union
station would help make transfers easier for patrons to get to the commuter rail lines as well as the West lines.
Otherwise, patrons that utilize the southwest alignment have to wait for an E line in order to get to Union station
and or Aurora west to get to golden.
I will keep saying this for as long as you don't do it. BRING BACK THE C-LINE!! Really, you need to. People
going to Union Station from Englewood and Littleton should not be forced to change trains at I-25 & Broadway.
And here's another idea, come up with a new light rail line that goes from Mineral Station to Peoria Station, which
I know is doable as you currently have one track that goes up to the bridge over the Broadway from Evans
Station. This would give Englewood and Littleton a fast connection to the University of Denver, Aurora, and the
airport. Yes it would bypass I-25 & Broadway but they have a line that goes there, it's not a problem.
I seek leadership to fund the southwest rail extension to C-470 and Lucent Blvd while I seek leadership to reroute
D Line service to Union Station with RTD route 402L SOP being implemented Monday-Saturday except modify
SOP route 402L Sunday service from 9AM-6PM due to low ridership and underutilization outside of the current
weekend hours before SOP implementation of route 402L. I also seek leadership of the second phase of route
402L SOP implementation of weekend service being discontinued in May 2027 due to low ridership and
underutilization on weekends. Lastly I seek leadership for a May 2028 target for opening of the D Line Extension
to C-470 & Lucent Blvd with D Line service being increased to 10 minutes 7 days a week by AM and PM peak
service being increased to 5 minutes bi-directionally, also funding for BRT service down Broadway to replace
routes 0B, 0, and 0L with service on weekdays and weekends from town center to Union Station and Civic Center
Station by naming the lines Red Line (Town Center to Union Station 5 minute frequency by rerouting it down
highlands ranch Pkwy to Broadway) Yellow Line (Town Center to Civic Center Station (same frequency and route
as Red Line)) with the implementation of d line Extension to C-470 & Lucent Blvd in May 2028 by discontinuing
route 402L service with the implementation of D Line Service to C-470 & Lucent Blvd in May 2028 due to low

ANYTHING that improves commuting from the NW side to the CBD. Offices are in the CBD not Union Station.

This ride is safer, and it has less stops and it runs along the streets where I work. Not having this Free Metro Ride
has a huge impact on getting to and from work.
Bring it back!
Rush hour service would be great!
I really appreciate the implementation of the free metro line to improve connections to federal office given the
RTO taking place. As I live in Broomfield, I’d also really appreciate restarting the FF4 as the FF1 through Union is
much slower for me and the FF1 is getting crowded at peak commute times. Thanks.

Really great while the mallride is not working and the quick commute across downtown to the train and bus
stations.
Please bring back the Free MetroRide. It is convenient for the people who work on 18th. It is also very
inconvenient right now having to walk through the construction on 16th Street. I like that the FMR is more reliable
than the Mall Shuttle.
This is needed as there are people who work on 18th St and North of 18th there are not easy was to get around
the free mall ride on 16th (currently 15 & 17th) gets really crowded and is slowed by the frequency of stops

Please bring back the MetroRide! Thank you!!
I so miss the option of taking the MetroRide and am excited that you're proposing to bring it back! There are not
many options near 18th & Broadway to head to Union Station and this would provide a great option. Thank you!
This route is incredibly more useful than the Mall Ride in its current state. Having this option will enable much
quicker trips to Union Station for rail connections, as well as generally increasing mobility downtown.
We really used the MetroRide in the past and hope you can extend the hours of service.
We live in the northeast edge of downtown (20th and Lincoln) and have no nearby RTD options to go directly to
Union Station to connect with other lines. Please reinstate the Free Metroride AND INCREASE the service to
EVERY day, and ALL day. Thank you.
PS Our area has NO nearby RTD service except for the L line which goes nowhere anyone needs to go!!! Please
reinstate the L line stop at the convention center/theater district. Right now, the L line is pointless!!
I would prefer to take FMR over the 16th street mall ride
Finally! New bus lanes on 18th are underutilized. This change will make it much easier & faster to get from Union
Station to upper downtown. Next step, add more hours.
I am occasionally in downtown Denver during rush hour and this would help getting to and from Union Station.
The metroride is much faster and more convenient than the mall ride.

Attachment: Attachment G - Survey (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

This would greatly approve my commute experience

I would like it to run all day and not have a break between 9am and 3pm.
This will better connect me to my job during the work week. I missed this service when it was gone.
The MetroRide is such a short distance in the heart of downtown—it should run every 5 minutes to provide true
rapid service. If I miss a bus, it’s faster for me to walk to my destination than wait 10 minutes.
This change would improve my commuting experience and would be a change that rtd made that would be
helpful to my experience. Not something I can say about previous schedule changes.

This service will allow me to return to office and downtown more often if I can more predictably get from Union
Station to Civic Center
Add more trips not just during peak hours
The MetroRide is a very valuable resource for me. I work downtown and with out the MetroRide I have to run
most the time a half a mile to catch a bus when it is not in service. When it is in service I only have to walk a block
to get to union. Plus it's a lot more enjoyable to ride than the 15 or the MallRide.
Yes I want this service back. It will be good for the 20th and welton area. The L line is just not as convenient

I live at 20th and California and it would be so nice to be able to use it to get to Union station.
Thank you for considering reinstating the MetroRide. I work one block south of the capitol building. It takes me
half an hour to get from Union Station to my office relying on the MallRide, and I often feel unsafe. The MetroRide
cuts travel time in half and allows me to worry less about my safety.
Please bring the Metro back! It is much needed for getting from Union Station to the other end of the mall!
Yes! It was so nice having the option in the fall, this perfectly aligns with N line arrivals and cuts my commute
down by 20 mins from Union to the Capitol. Make this permanent!!
I used this service everyday prior to the pandemic. Since the service was cut my commute has been significantly
more challenging. When I heard it was coming back, you cannot believe how excited I was. Unfortunately, the
proposed time windows were a little deflating... I typically dont get to Union station until 9:30am so the 9am cutoff
was unfortunate to hear... please, please, please extend the hours a little bit further into the morning for those
who's workdays dont start until a little later in the morning (thanks in advance)
I strongly support reinstating the Free MetroRide. As a Federal employee who is required to come back to the
office full time, this will substantially help the portion of my commute from Union Station to my office.
I would LOVE to see the free MetroRide service return. My normal route (FF4) was suspended during COVID so I
now take the FF1 to union station and then have to transfer to another bus or walk to get across downtown. The
MetroRide offered a great solution since it runs frequently during peak times making it a great option for
commuters. Additionally it’s faster than the mall ride since it doesn’t stop at every street. The mall ride is great for
people visiting/exploring downtown but the MetroRide is a much better option for commuters and I hope it is
reinstated!

Please increase evening hours to 7pm. Some work a little later.

This is a great idea however why not just allow the 120x bus to take the route of the old 122x which allowed for
downtown drop offs ?
I Love the Free MetroRide because it’s much faster conpared to the Free MallRide but however, it would be much
better to run it on weekends too because it’s acts as an express. route and I used to use it to get from Union To
Civic Center and go to Cherry Creek Shopping mall on weekends! If not, then please bring back the Flatiron Flyer
Route from Civic to Boulder Junction AND/OR Boulder Downtown because it runs along 18th and 19th St. and
also there was TOD project and people got property just for them to waste money.

Happy to have more service later at night, though I don’t usually feel comfortable riding that line after 8PM. I
attribute this to no fares ever being collected. The G line almost always collects fares. The N line never does. I am
not sure if this is intentional or a missed opportunity to collect revenue to fund more projects and expand access.

Trust the N line more after ball games and concerts than Uber.

Adjusting to a later time for the northbound trip really helps me out, and allows me to enjoy time downtown longer.
I ask work downtown and my shift ends at 11pm, and would appreciate an 11:26pm option 7 days a week so I
don't have to park downtown.
Weekend late night trips back north are essential for theater goers like myself. Wednesdays would be nice too.
😁

Thank you for adding an additional late evening trip on Friday nights!
I take the N Line during the week and adding a late Friday night trip from Union Station to Eastlake would be a
nice addition for when people are downtown for shows/games/concerts. I may not personally utilize this new late
Friday night trip often, but would be good to know it's available, if needed.
This will allow me to attend late night events downtown and get home if I stay late.
This is great news and a very welcomed addition.
I generally use this line during commuting hours but any additional service on the N line is much appreciated!
Thank you!
I would add one more time slot 11:56
This is an extremely minor service increase. To get me to rely on the N line more, you would need to move to 15
minute frequencies almost all day. Otherwise, I won’t trust it to reliably get me downtown and back any faster or
more conveniently than driving. As it is because of its minimal schedule, I only use it occasionally and one way if
my wife can drive me home. You spent so much money on the infrastructure only to provide useless headways,
it’s really a ridiculous system. Also, there are too many stops on the N line which makes it needlessly slow, and it
doesn’t go far enough north. You have right of way all the way up to Erie, you should expand it. Ending in a
random parking lot in the middle of a not dense Thornton neighborhood and 3+ miles from I25 is a terrible design.
To connect to other connections especially buses
this allows an option to reach destination for people who might work late or want to attend late events In Denver
an additional option to reach the Thornton Welby stop. Since the 122x is no longer in service. I want to bring back
the 122x back during peak hours and have requested via electronic form but I haven’t seen proposed service
changes, how can I get this on an agenda? It would make what should be a 20 minute ride for many people not
take over an hour to get to Civic Center instead of Union station and then connecting using the free mall ride, and
reduce congestion. Also improve safety from 16th street. Thank you for reading!

Attachment: Attachment G - Survey (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

Please continue to expand late night trips on the N line. Transit should be running until the bars close to support a
safer way to get home. Later night service will also be impactful for sports games and concerts as those are other
things that go later. I would love to take the train to a concert and not be stranded at the end of the night.

There are several events downtown that I like to attend, especially during the summer, and I always worry about
having to leave an event early so that I don't miss the train.
For the last two years I have ridden the N Line for transportation to entertainment downtown. It would be more
convenient to know there is a later N Line train available.

This will be good- it's always a rush to get to the last train after Friday sporting events
This is very good news.
Increased frequency allows the N-line to become a more integral part of our life in Thornton. This 11:26PM route
will be used instead of driving downtown and back because we can still use the train when stay out late

All of the rail and BRT lines should be given priority over everything else, especially right now. Finish the BRT
lines ASAP, so we can get the remainder of the changes for these rail lines completed, and service times
increased to potentially 10 minute intervals vs 15 even, especially along the N, W, H, D, F, & E lines respectively.
I mean would be cooler if had later options especially for those who like to go downtown and then don't have to
take a $60+ Uber. Do like maybe after 11 one train every hour to help with coverage - also should for morning
weekdays/work commutes do 4 train cars instead of 2. Sometimes cant find a seat... and if your numbers don't
reflect that its because the ticket system is a joke.
Increase sunday service too because people like me go out on sundays to malls and what not 😊
Please make more rides available on the N line
This would be much appreciated.
Please keep investing in the N Line! I'd like to see the last trip depart Union Station at/after 12 AM on Fridays, but
the addition of the 11:26 PM train is a good start.
I seek leadership to fund the N Line Extension to North Thornton & Hwy 7. Please influence 85% of RTD

It's ridiculous don't even know when the trains are actually going to be there, can't count on rtd at all to be
anywhere on time and why should we pay for passes when the drivers all let people ride for free. It's getting really
old when I barely can live and still have to pay for a pass and all these junkies and homeless people get to ride for
free everyday all day long. Rtd is pathetic and dangerous. You don't do anything about the drug use and drug
deals going on at colorado station and all stations really your security is non existent. Rtd is just all around
pathetic no wo Der nobody wants to ride and it sucks for us that have to ride it.

How about improving the H-Line in general. They never are on time, I can wait an hour at station and never see
one H Line train arrive or depart. It's the worst train line and not very dependable at all.
Please plan accordingly so we do not have construction sites scattered without a promising competition date.

Any reduction in schedule for the summer will impact my ability to get to work. I am riding 3 days a week now and
need to during the summer. Just when the schedule get better and you hire drivers you want to reduce it again.
Constantly changing schedules is killing ridership.
Well you didn’t share what the schedule changes would be so I can’t actually answer this
The lack of reliable H trains has had a very significant and negative impact for both my husband and myself. It’s
been terribly frustrating and consequential. Having frequent and on time H trains will make an enormous
difference for us.
Lately this line has been infrequent and undependable. Can't take the light rail to appointments downtown if you
can't count on service.
Half the time the trains take way too long or are missing completely so on time trains would be a huge

I’m assuming this will be positive, but just saying “minor changes to schedule” doesn’t actually tell me what the
changes are. I depend on this route to get to my job, so I need assurance that it will be running every 15 minutes

The H line and the Aurora side trains need a LOT of attention, but service frequency also needs to increase.

Reliability and frequency will make my commute quicker and consistent for transfers. I have not used rtd because
it’s not reliable.
Anything you can do to make the trains consistently on time would be great. And every 15 minutes would be

The details are not mentioned here, so that could be improved. After reviewing the W line changes online, I feel
that it's important to have the W line running to Union station on Sunday nights as well until 2am. I also feel that
the lines should start one hour earlier for those that have lengthy commutes or need to get to Aurora. I utilize the
W line more often than any RTD service, so it is very important that it runs at appropriate times based on
community need. Since it runs so far West I feel it needs longer hours
The w line is always late its super hard to plan for.

Grateful this line is available in case I miss my main bus which I've had to do recently.
The change will positively impact me if the times are more in sync with connecting trains. Another change you
should be making on the W train is adding more security. I am a single woman who doesn't feel too safe on the W
line. I seldom ride it anymore.
I need to catch the 30/32 SB on federal. I don't care about anything else. I'll stop complaining when I quit missing
my bus by literal seconds after trying to run up tre stairs at Decatur station
It would provide stability in getting to school (Red Rocks Campus) on time without worrying about being late.

Could use more W Line
It's unclear to me how this will affect me as your online presentation gave zero details on what the proposed
changes will look like in praxis. All the presentation says is that there are proposed changes to help with tardy
trains and to better match bus schedules. I cannot find any information on what this actually looks like and what
exactly the proposed changes are. This makes it pretty difficult for any riders to provide actionable feedback.
Please do better.
More security on this rail line would be helpful
What i really want is just transparency. What about a text line so I can find out what time the next train will be. But
actually accurate. Not just a pdf of the poster at stations. Like real time information.
I have tried to find information on what this change is. In any case, the current schedule has W line departing
Union Station only 2 minutes after A line arrives. I currently am a federal employee and with the return to work
order, I am trying to take A line from Aurora to the Federal Center. If you can have W line depart 5 to 7 minutes
after A line arrives at Union Station that would work well. Currently, I have to wait 15 minutes for W line to depart,
wasting 30 minutes of my day. Thank you!
What are the minor changes to schedule? I can't provide feedback unless I have actual information.
Train needs to run later after events! Was leaving ball arena once with one train left for the night, the train came

Depends on what the changes are but if the changes mean the train will show up at the time wits supposed to
and makes it to where it's supposed to on time and is a line that makes sense for workers that work downtown
commuting from Littleton then yes that seems positive (again nothing is provided on what the actual change is) need officers on this line with all of the unhoused on fentanyl unclothed on the train
It seems like the schedule is changed every few months it's starting to be unwieldy
Service reliability on weekends is as important as that on weekdays. I hope this improvement will ensure on time
performance on weekends as well.

I'd like to know what the "minor changes" are. If the changes are to make trips more frequent, great. But I doubt
that is what is meant.
What is the proposed schedule change???
would be great if it was every 10 min during the morning 7-9am

Anything to improve the frequency or on-time schedule to Government Center is fantastic news. The light rail is
currently busy, and not my first choice in terms of reliability.
I would like to see an east bound train departure from Jeffco at 5:08am M-F.
Thanks!!
The schedule timing needs to be better

All of the rail and BRT lines should be given priority over everything else, especially right now. Finish the BRT
lines ASAP, so we can get the remainder of the changes for these rail lines completed, and service times
increased to potentially 10 minute intervals vs 15 even, especially along the N, W, H, D, F, & E lines respectively.

Higher amount of traffic for an already-busy Colfax by having only one lane per side. It would be ideal if people
were to actually use RTD instead of driving, but I'm not sure if that's something that will happen immediately

Having more frequent busses coming by would be really convenient and helpful. Its happened multiple times in
the freezing cold weather, where a group of us will be waiting for the 16 but this is after 7 pm and the google
maps will say that one is coming in less than 10 minutes but then that time passes, and I would check again, and
it'll say that a bus is coming by in 20 or so minutes. I understand that the times online can't always be accurate
but to go from thinking you're gonna wait 10 minutes, to waiting 30 to 40 minutes in freezing cold temperature. A
lot of these people waiting already have health problems, and maybe i know that i get to go home to a warm
place, i know that not everybody does.
This is a well traveled route that offers important connection to the W line and will improve my commute options

I love the increase in service along a vital corridor. Living on colfax & osage, this connects me to west colfax and
to civic center, woth almost no other transit options. We need more 10 minute headway across RTD.
Increased frequency makes it easier for me to choose the 16 over the W.
this will alleviate the packed buses I encounter daily, standing room only occasionally, this is a commuter route for
me, odd hours throughout the day, this makes my commute much more reliable
I take the 16 everyday from work. Increasing this frequency of stops would give me more flexibility and reduce
crowding.
Bring back the West Colfax limited, service for West Denver has only gotten worse over time and never improved
This is a change that should be implemented BEFORE September… but if we HAVE to wait, then I suppose we
have to. Make a connection to the W line more often as well from this bus line at ONE or TWO stations.
Having 10 Minute afternoon frequencies are very important and I am glad it's happening, will it use more block
than currently used? Considering the fact that 1609 joins mid-day it in theory shouldn't consume blocks.

This is an excellent change for the 73 and the improved frequency makes the route much more useful.
About every other week, I have an appointment in Lowry. Increased frequency on Route 73 will mean my
transfers are shorter, as well as shorter wait time on the return trip.
I take this route to work in the morning and am often only just able to catch it as a transfer from the A line, and
with the way my schedule is, I just miss the bus to get home, resulting in me waiting at my stop for at least 30
minutes, and this increase would be convenient for myself and others.

Attachment: Attachment G - Survey (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

Reduced headways are very nice during the day. With the last service change (Jan 2025), evening connections
between A line westbound and Route 73 southbound were significantly degraded. The 30 minute headway on A
line and 30 minute headway on Route 73 were desync'd, which resulted in excessively long connection times
(20+ minutes, rather than 5 minutes). If the departure times were resync'd, it would be very much appreciated.
Sundays between 8pm - 11pm should be at 30 minute intervals at the very least. I work at the Central Park
Walmart and having to stay and wait an hour for the bus is a huge inconvenience to myself and other coworkers
who rely on public transportation. When we get off work, we want to go home. Not be forced to sit and wait for an
extra hour. The 73 is already inconsistent enough and it’s NEVER on time.

Packet Pg. 287

It is important that the service align with the A Line at Central Park Station.v
My daughter takes this bus to and from school and it is always packed. Running additional buses during that time
also means that she doesn’t have to get to school 25 minutes early because the later bus gets there too late.
I take the 73 quite often during the week to get to and from school, so this is very helpful
I like this change a lot and think it will help me more

Increasing frequency during business hours will make the commute better aligned with the transfers I need to
make.
This would be optimal as between 4-6 pm the bus is generally either too early, running late (10 or more minutes),
and lots of students leaving little to no seating. It’s hard when you are transferring from a 83L or83D and the
buses are literally missing one another depending on who gets to location 16178 first.
I do like the idea of running more buses on Quebec St, but I also think the fifteen minute interval needs to be on
Saturday as well as there are a lot of essential business services along Quebec that people want to get to,
especially as this bus connects with a good number of other routes. You also need a bus route that serves
Quebec south of Belleview Station, call it route 74 and have it run along South Quebec between Belleview and C470 University Park and Ride, connecting with Highlands Ranch and routes 24 and 402L, and also 66 at
Arapahoe Road.

My daughter takes this bus to and from school. Moving to 15 minute increments will make it much easier for her
to get to and from school on time, and to coordinate with various after school activities. I would hope the 15
minute increments could stay until 8pm, though, to really reflect after school sports timings.

in and early out. I appreciate you all very much.
We have lived in nederland for 5 years now and use the bus sometimes, but would use it more if we could get

Please be sure that the scheduled changes don’t negatively affect high-school and middle school ages students

Desperately needed for residents of Nederland.
Pleased to be getting back to a better (i.e. more frequent buses) schedule.

We would like to see bus to High School and back. In fact during summer we see them going there, they just don’t
stop to pick us at Eldora 72.
NB1/2 should be an express line. There are too many intermediate stops along this route, especially between the
mouth of the canyon and the transit center.
My husband works in Boulder but we live in the mountains, with his work schedule he was not able to commute
by bus after the route was affected by Covid. Previously he rode 4days/week. Hopefully now he will be able to
ride again.
It would be great if the bus could continue to end/ begin at Nederland Middle High School. The increase in service
is terrific.
Requesting bus added between 4:10 & 6:25 pm weekdays around 5pm to support folks working 8-5 shifts.
Ideally would like the 7:39 bus to run earlier. Previous was 7:09. 7:19 would be perfect to get to work or school for

We are on the 44 and the added times would help for getting to work.

Hello,

Attachment: Attachment G - Survey (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

I just want to make sure that #44 Bus has more busses going to and from downtown to Ward Road and not just
every hour. There have been some busses quite recently that have gotten taken out of rotation so I had to figure it
out and take the W Line (grateful for that its there) and then catch the 100 bus down Kipling street. Can we make
sure that there are more busses added to and from? I think that is what it looks like here that is being proposed
but just want to make sure during the summer hours that I don't get stuck waiting. Overall this bus line is amazing
and love my bus drivers :-)
This bus helps connect me to more parts of the city and having it run more often during peak times will be helpful
It would be even better if there were more buses per hour on this route.

Packet Pg. 293

16.F.g

The hourly run of the 44, is the biggest challenge. Half hour stops would be a huge improvement to this line.
Timing for arrival/departure times on inbound/outbound busses for getting to/from downtown is inconvenient for a
9-5 arrival/departure. The 48 runs more often but takes longer to get downtown. It would be nice if the 44, had this
option.
Commuter time services are necessary for access to downtown.
Any increase on rt 44 would be positive.
This change is not enough. The 44 needs to run more often than once per hour all day long.

I take this bus in the 8 o clock hour as does my child. Adding another bus would be very beneficial to the
neighborhood and hopefully increase ridership.
I don't often take the 44 but I am glad it is still available to me west of Kipling.
I frequently use this route it would be convenient to have more buses run.
Would love earlier options before 5pm to aid parents going home to pick up kids from daycare/school.
Losing the half hour rush hour buses in January had a large impact on my ability to get two and from work on
time. I know a number of people that had to stop taking the bus altogether. Adding these 4 times back into the
schedule is extremely helpful and I look forward to this getting passed.
The recent changes to the January 2025 Scheduling have had very negative impact on commuting options into
and out of the downtown. The inclusion of more frequent morning and evening schedules will greatly help support
ridership and address many of the issues facing right now due to timing, capacity and lack of accomodation.
Thank you.
This is a good start, but improving frequency to 30 minutes all day long on weekdays is essential for us to
consider using the 44 again as much as we were before the last service reduction.
I would like to see RTD bring back the weekday 6am eastbound trip from Wheat Ridge/Ward so that employees
reporting downtown can arrive by 7am! Overall, very excited about this service change, the 44 certainly needs
more frequent peak hour service than the current 60 minute service.

Attachment: Attachment G - Survey (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

Does not impact me.

Thank you for adding some of the peak-travel period trips back!! It's been hard for me to use the 44 since the
January service changes reduced the trips at peak commute times. Having these additional times will really make
the 44 more useful for me.
It would also still be great to add back a 6am departure from Ward Station in future.
Thank you for bringing them back, although taking them away will have caused a huge hit on 44 ridership which
may be unrecoverable at this stage.

the 38 is CONSISTENTLY more than 10 minutes late. not only does it require infrastructure updates such as bus
lanes along 38th ave bridge, bur it it also requires increased frequency because populated west denver is
severely disconnected from the rest of the city and cross town commutes are excessively long. it should be

There needs to be an increase to half hourly frequency on the route. This route is unique in being in the city of

I rely on this bus to get from my apartment to the university light rail station. This line already has very poor
frequency. Reducing this further would be even worse
This route would be useful for people living in cap hill if the frequency wasn’t abysmal, especially on weekends.

I have told you once and I will tell you again, route 24 needs to be on a half hour interval, at least between 40th
and Colorado Station and Hampden Ave, and especially now that the 35 bus is going east again. And what you
can do is have one 24 follow it's existing route between 40th and C-470, while the other one goes between 40th
and Englewood Station to connect with the southwest light rail line, enabling people in Englewood and Littleton to
have another option to go to places like Cherry Creek Mall and the Botanic Gardens, as well as better connecting
people who live along University Blvd to places like Swedish Medical Center without having to change buses, it

The main issue with the DASH is that it spends 10 minutes driving through Main Street Louisville, Pine Street and
Via Appia before getting back on South Boulder Road. There are not enough people who get on the bus at that
stop to warrant the big U through Louisville every 1/2 hour. What needs to be done is having it where every hour,
there are 2 dash buses that leave at 30 minute intervals, with one of the buses going from the Willoughby center

Please make the chances at the schedule, to make it more frequently, also if you can do it in at the general

Great!! I sometimes use this transfer to get from my home in Capitol Hill to DIA, but so often the A train pulls up to

Fix the LD1. Your last schedule change leaving Longmont 6 minutes late makes me consistently late to work.
Even worse, the 5:30 bus has made me miss my connecting bus in Longmont, leaving me to walk home every
night. Most days, the 5:30 bus leaves Union Station at least 3-5 minutes late, meaning we get to Longmont 10
minutes late. Since we lost the LX buses, my commute is now 2 hours one way.

All night service, even if just hourly, would help with my commute to work greatly.
I am unable to tell what changes are happening by this description. Is it timing? Is it more buses? Is it reducing
time between buses down from 30 minutes? I like the idea of greater reliability but how? As a bus commuter, if
like to know more details of what the planned changes are

The BOLT is a great option to access employment and services in Boulder from Longmont as well as connecting
to other regional routes into Denver. However, on Saturday and Sundays you don't run the full route, starting and
stopping at Bross/8th. The 324, which would connect to that stop, does not begin running until after 8am on the
weekends and stops running before the BOLT ends. I live in NE Longmont off 21st. I already have to walk a mile
to the bus stop to access either line at 21/Main. Not running the BOLT the full route on weekends limits my access
to a needed transportation option.
Please bring back the early BOLT route. I have to be in Longmont by 0645, and have not been able to take bus.

Depends on the minor changes…but I like the stops that are available, but I really would appreciate more bus
frequency on the weekends. Like maybe every 30 minutes instead of every hour on the weekends

Attachment: Attachment G - Survey (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

The northbound BOLT is chronically late/delayed. I rely on this bus to get home from college. Improvements to its
schedule and timing would be greatly appreciated.

I think it would be great to increase bus service to the new low-income housing development.
Yes please add more connections and hubs to the Willoboughy Corner area to serve new tenants
i use this to go to work, i cannot afford a car. it could impact me if the timing is longer and i am late for work
Why are both the 225 and DASH being extended to Boulder County Low Income Housing Development, rather
than using half of those resources to improve service elsewhere in Boulder County? Rather than investing 2 FTE
for these duplicate changes, the second FTE should be used to expand coverage elsewhere like improving the
frequency of LD service from Lafayette/Broomfield. This change will serve a very low number of riders compared
to improving connectivity across the network.

I seek leadership to Permanently discontinue route 225s 40 FT fleet RTD Boulder Division on weekdays and
weekends with all route 225's fleet to all 40 FT fleet contracted by transdev Longmont. Also I seek leadership to
permanently discontinue route 206 weekday service fleet from Transdev Longmont by making the 40 FT fleet
from RTD Boulder Division. Lastly I seek leadership to discontinue route jump fleet from RTD boulder division 7
days a week by making the routes fleet transdev Longmont. As soon as possible trade transdev Longmont 30 ft
fleet buses to transdev Englewood to support low ridership routes like route 59, 29, 36, 4, 402L, and 483. Please

I love this change and thinks its great that its connecting the new low income housing area. However I believe
there is increased demand within Boulder City limits for service along the Baseline corridor. I think it would be
beneficial to run 225L (local) buses that run from Downtown Boulder Station to somewhere around Platt Middle
School that when combined with the existing 225 services would provide 15 headways along Baseline. This would
provide more value per mile as this is a shorter route with more density. Thanks!

Most major cold weather cities provide some sort of place to stay warm during the winter months while waiting for
buses and trains.
I find it difficult to accept that Denver RTD apparently has no interest in providing a warm enclosure at major
transit hubs, specifically the Central Park Station.
Wait times between buses are usually 30 minutes, sometimes longer. I won’t use RTD during the cold months if I
have to stand in the cold/wind. Thank you.

This line overall needs more frequency, ESPECIALLY on weekends. once an hour, when I commute from
southmoor to DTC area, is rough working in retail when im here every weekend.
Less riders because you throttle service. This route is a nightmare
On 73 and 65 please keep them as early 4:00. As you already make changes recently. Especially for the people

You don’t even tell me what the changes this is the most ridiculous way to communicate a change
I dont know what tripper service is, i dont know if the changes to schedule make the bus run more or less
frequently. this is a very useful bus for my day to day professional travel and it also gives me closer access to 2
grocery stores. i think it should run more often

Attachment: Attachment G - Survey (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

The bus should come more frequently on this line as its route goes right by a high school, a senior center, City
Park, and downtown. It seems to come twice an hour at best, assuming it's not running late or leaving significantly
early.
Impact would depend on how significantly the schedule changes affect my commute. Improving on-time
performance would be helpful, as this bus is typically very late during the morning commute. The trip planner app
is often unreliable I. This scenario, as the bus just gets later as it gets closer.
This bus is ALWAYS delayed at least 10-15 minutes in the afternoon and results in me missing my connection!
Please increase frequency or adjust the schedule accordingly.

i would love if this route was on time, it’s hard to catch sometimes if it’s late and sometimes it’s packed with east
high school students
More buses during commute hours (7am to 9am and 4pm to 6pm)
Decreases frequency - want better all day frequency as an alternative to route 15 during construction
It would be great if the 20 ran more frequently!

The 20 route west of downtown only runs 3 times in the morning (6:00, 7:00, and 8:00 roughly) and 3 times in the
afternoon (3:12, 4:12, and 5:33 from NREL). Many nrel employees (myself included) would benefit from increased
frequency (even to 30 minutes) and possibly a shifted schedule to have a later bus in the morning and at night
I ride the 20 to and from work, and it is often running late, so more on-time busses would be great.
Please run more frequently
The 20 west remains absolutely useless , with only 6 stops a day. With this and removal of The West Colfax
limited bus service for West Denver has only gotten worse over time not better.

Attachment: Attachment G - Survey (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

This route needs more buses in general. It is the only bus to run down Montview and it runs every 30 minutes.

I do not know what kind of adjustments to the schedule will be made to Route 483, but it should align with the
schedule with the the rail lines’ northbound departure and their southbound arrival, with a few minutes offset to
allow for time to transfer even with minor delays from the rail. This is to prevent unnecessary delays in bus
transferring.

Instead of minor schedule adjustments for route 483 please have it expanded on weekdays and add service on
weekends while supporting RTD System Optimization Plan. Also add new funding for a reinstatement of route 403
I used to take that route so did other people there is a need for that route because there were people who rode
that periodically Monday-Friday between mineral station and Lincoln Station. Please let me know what people join
tomorrow's public meeting and what I can do to help this route to be restored to service.
I use the 483 quite often to get to Parker Rd and I use the 121/83L/130/133/R Line/H Line at Nine Mile. Time
adjustments would help me make on-time connections

I leave work at 3.30 from Parker. Southbound 483 reaches there by then. Changing it’s time too much will impact

I think this is a very good start, but if I read the system optimization plan correctly this bus was planning
eventually to run on weekends and I think RTD should start running this bus on weekends and holidays

I just wish the 66 would run later than 9pm so I didn't have to take an uber home from work on most nights.
Route 66 also needs to be on a half hour interval, as this bus goes through a lot of business and retail areas, as
well as serving as a connection for places like Arapahoe Community College, Southglenn, and
Littleton/Downtown and Arapahoe light rail stations. More people would ride this bus if it ran more regularly. I also
would like to see the return of route 77 that used to serve Dry Creek Rd, Mineral Ave, and Ken Caryl Ave, and I
mean the return of the FULL ROUTE between Ken Caryl Park and Ride and Dry Creek Station, we just need
more east-west bus service in the south suburbs overall, it's lacking down there.

Last summer the Jump stopped at 48th and Arapahoe at 3:30pm and then not until 4:40pm. There needs to be a
bus around 4pm. Seventy minutes is too long between pick ups when the rest of the year it stops every 15
minutes.
Hopefully this makes it easier to catch FF1 in downtown, some times the connections are too tight when Jump is
just slightly delayed.

I think that the 19 needs increased frequency as do most Union Station oriented routes. The added service to

Thank you for doing this, Pecos Junction is too difficult to access on foot from a bus stop because of having to

DIRECTOR REQUESTED AGENDA ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Records Request Fee Waivers for Members of the Media

March 20, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
April 29, 2025

Added to Committee Agenda as a Director initiated request pursuant to RTD Board Bylaws Art. V,
Section 3(b). Requires formal motion and second at Committee meeting.
MOTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt the attached resolution providing CORA and CCJRA request fee
waivers for certain verified members of the media.
BOARD REPRESENTATIVES
Chris Nicholson, Board Secretary, District A
Matt Larsen, Director, District, E
Brett Paglieri, Director, District M
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD is committed to transparency and to making its records available to the public for inspection as
provided by the Colorado Open Records Act (CORA) and Criminal Justice Records Act (CCJRA). The
agency receives hundreds of requests for its records each year. These requests are submitted through
RTD’s online CORA portal: https://www.rtd-denver.com/open-records. Requests come from a variety of
requestors, including customers, academics, other governmental entities, RTD employees and Directors,
claimants or their counsel, and members of the media. See the data attachment to this report for
historical information on requests. The agency has one employee in the Information Governance and
Management Division within the General Counsel Department who serves as the agency’s records
custodian and coordinates the collection and review of records in response to requests. It should be
noted that coordinating record responses is only one element of the employee’s responsibilities. Sections
24-72-205(6) and 24-72-306(1), C.R.S. allow governmental entities to charge a fee for the research and
retrieval of records. Under CORA, effective July 1, 2024, the maximum hourly fee is $41.37 with the
first hour being free of charge. Currently, RTD charges $30 per hour. Requestors, after making their
initial request, are provided fee estimate for the amount of time over an hour needed to produce the
requested records and can decide whether to pay the fee or narrow the request. The timeframe the
agency has to produce the records is tolled until the requestor submits the fee.

Packet Pg. 328

16.G

CORA requests and CCJRA requests for records of official action must be fulfilled within three business
days; however, should requests require additional time for staff to compile, the agency will notify the
requestor of the extenuating circumstance and will have an extension of up to seven business days.
Under CORA, public entities may waive fees for records used for a public purpose, including public
agency program support, nonprofit activities, journalism, and academic research. Under CCJRA, fees
may be waived in the criminal justice agency’s discretion. Because staff time is needed to research and
respond to records requests that could otherwise be devoted to the agency’s primary mission, RTD does
not grant fee waivers.
Research to date has not identified any other governmental entity in Colorado that waives records
request fees. Research did indicate that the State of South Dakota waives fees for the first $100 of
photocopies for members of the media. Other research has discovered that the City of Boulder has an
exemption whereby students requesting documents related to a school assignment need not pay fees
related to their CORA request unless their request involves extensive staff time. Finally, some
governmental entities have specifically stated that certain custodians of records (e.g., city manager,
town clerk) have the discretionary capacity under the respective statute to waive or reduce fees when
the request is made for a public purpose.
The practice of charging a de minimis fee on all requests, which require more than one hour of staff time
(the first hour is always free), is done to encourage efficient use of government resources, and to
discourage actions which place an unnecessary burden on government resources. It is a widely accepted
practice across governmental entities to charge fees to retrieve government records, and to charge those
fees indiscriminate of the identity of the requestor.
DISCUSSION
It is proposed that the Board act by way of the attached resolution to do the following:
•
•
•
•
•

Waive the first $300 of fees (with a maximum of $600 per mass media outlet) for certain verified
members of the members of the media
Set a cap of no more than $5,000 in fee waivers granted under the policy in a given calendar
year
Task the GM/CEO with creating a process to verify the eligibility of media members and
organizations for the proposed fee waivers
Direct staff to track the amount of fee waivers provided to individual members of the media and
media organizations
The resolution would be in effect from July 1, 2025 to December 31, 2026

The Committee is asked to discuss the merits of the attached resolution and take action on whether to
support the resolution or not.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There are two primary financial impacts to this action. The first, smaller impact is the actual dollar
amount in foregone open records request fee revenue. The second, larger impact is the opportunity cost

Packet Pg. 329

16.G

to staff time and resources.
The financial impact to the agency of foregone legally allowable fees over the course of two calendar
years is no more than $10,000. In 2024, the agency processed 103 records requests from 33 members
of the media and charged a total of $1,059 in fees. Of those 103 requests only 15 resulted in a fee
being charged. As such, roughly 85% of records requests from the media in 2024 were able to be
fulfilled within the one free hour all requests are allotted. The policy will likely increase the total volume
of requests from the media. However, in some circumstances requestors disaggregate requests so as to
avoid incurring a fee, i.e. submitting multiple requests to which the time needed to respond is less than
one hour. As such the resolution, if approved, may also lead to members of the media aggregating their
requests, thus putting some downward pressure on the number of requests submitted.
There will also be significant impacts to staff time dedicated to verifying the fee waiver eligibility of
requestors, fulfilling additional records requests, and tracking the amount of fee waivers provided. The
agency has one employee who coordinates responses to public records requests, and this coordination is
performed by the employee in addition to other job responsibilities. Staff time is not simply limited to the
sole employee who is responsible for coordinating responses to open records requests. The majority of
time spent responding to records requests is by staff members outside of the records department. These
staff are responding to requests in addition to their primary day-to-day duties. Therefore, time spent by
staff responding to requests diverts resources away from staff performing their regular day-to-day
duties.
Should the resolution be adopted, a significant amount of additional staff time will need to be diverted
from other responsibilities to fulfilling additional requests. Excluding fees paid by members of the media,
over the past three years, the average annual amount of fees paid to produce records from 2022 – 2024
was $5,034.96, while the average annual amount of records request fees paid by members of the media
over the same period was $1,143.87. Should the resolution be adopted, and members of the media take
full advantage of the fee waiver at current per hour costs, the annual amount of time staff dedicate to
responding to requests would increase by at least 4.37x or 437%. Additionally, at current trends, the
annual amount of time dedicated to responding to requests from members of the media would roughly
equal the amount of time dedicated to responding to requests from all other sources.

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT
RESOLUTION NO. ___, SERIES OF 2025
A RESOLUTION TO INCREASE CORA AND CCJRA ACCESS FOR COLORADO JOURNALISTS
WHEREAS, the Regional Transportation District (RTD) recognizes the vital role that journalists
play in informing the public about issues of local and regional importance; and
WHEREAS, members of the Colorado mass media play a unique and important role in informing
the public about the operations of the Regional Transportation District; and
WHEREAS, the Colorado Press Association and the Colorado Broadcasters Association represent
credentialed professionals dedicated to upholding transparency, accountability, and public
engagement; and
WHEREAS, the Colorado Open Records Act (CORA) and Colorado Criminal Justice Records Act
(CCJRA) are an essential tool for enabling media access to public records, which fosters a wellinformed citizenry and supports the principles of good governance; and
WHEREAS, the cost of CORA and CCJRA requests has been routinely raised as a barrier to
accessing public information, particularly for smaller media organizations and independent
journalists, thereby potentially limiting the public's access to critical information; and
WHEREAS, RTD is committed to promoting transparency and accessibility while ensuring that its
policies reflect equitable support for those who serve the public good;
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the Board of Directors of the Regional Transportation
District as follows:
1. Members of the Colorado mass media shall be eligible to receive a waiver of 90% of any
fees incurred, up to $300 total in a calendar year, for each CORA or CCJRA open records
requests, with a maximum of $600 waived for any mass media entity or employer.
2. Eligibility Verification: Requesters seeking the mass media waiver must submit an
application which either:
a) attests and provides documentation of current employment by or contract with a
voting organizational member of either the Colorado Press Association or the
Colorado Broadcasters Association
or;

b) attests and provides documentation that the applicant is a Colorado resident and an
active member of the Colorado mass media, corporate-owned or independent, as
defined in Colorado’s press shield law (C.R.S. § 13-90-119), which shall be linked
on the application. For the purposes of this resolution, “mass medium” shall also
include digital media.
3. In addition to the waiver for active members of the Colorado mass media, in keeping with
C.R.S. § 24-72-205 (4) The Regional Transportation District may, without creating any
enforceable right, reduce or waive fees at its sole discretion. Fee reductions and waivers
shall be uniformly applied among persons who are similarly situated.
4. Request Qualification: Applicants must confirm for each CORA or CCJRA request seeking
the waiver that it pertains to work to be used for a public purpose in service of their work
as a member of the mass media (C.R.S. § 24-72-205 (4)). The specific public purpose must
be identified in the request.
5. Administrative Procedure:
a) The RTD General Manager or their designee is directed to establish an efficient and
transparent process for verifying eligibility and applying fee waivers.
b) Applications shall be available no later than July 1st, 2025.
c) In a calendar year, only the first $5000 in qualifying requests by verified members
of the mass media shall be automatically waived. All additional requests may be
waived at RTD’s sole discretion as laid out in section 3, and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that this policy reaffirms the RTD's commitment to fostering
accountability, transparency, and collaboration with the mass media to enhance public trust and
engagement, and

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Review of 2025 Committee Approved Work Plans

March 25, 2025

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Jack Kroll, Executive Manager, Board Office
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
At the January 30, 2024, regular Board meeting, the Board of Directors approved a Bylaw amendment,
which calls for each standing committee of the Board to draft and approve an annual work plan. The
work plans approved by each committee cover meetings from March 2025 to February 2026.
Annual committee work plans are a useful tool for ensuring the Board and staff collaborate effectively to
accomplish the necessary work of the agency and Board, while providing dedicated space for the Board
to pursue governance/policy objectives and gain further insights into matters of interest to Directors.
Work plans elevate and respect the role of the committees of the Board as some of the most effective
forums for completing the work of the Board.
Subsequently the Finance & Planning, Operations, Safety, and Security, Performance, and Executive
committees have each approved a work plan for 2025.
DISCUSSION
The Board is asked to review the work plans and provide any additional input to the committees as those
committees proceed in their work for the balance of 2025.
This discussion aligns with the Strategic Priorities of Community Value, Customer Excellence, Employee
Ownership, and Financial Success, as the ability of the Board’s standing committees to effectively
govern directly impacts the overall performance of the agency. Organized committee work plans will
ensure RTD’s resources are used efficiently, and that the Board’s policy and governance objectives are
more focused, collaborative, and obtainable.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact to the review of the committee work plans.

RTD BOARD OF DIRECTORS
PERFORMANCE COMMITTEE
2025 WORK PLAN
As of February 24, 2025
COMMITTEE DEFINITION FROM BOARD BYLAWS: The Performance Committee
has three oversight functions: 1) Performance management of the General Manager and
CEO, 2) in close coordination with the General Manager and CEO, the development,
ongoing review, and subsequent amendment of long-range strategic planning efforts,
including the agency’s Strategic Plan, 3) high-level monitoring of agency performance in
relation to the Strategic Plan.
With respect to the performance management of the GM/CEO, the committee has primary
oversight over the GM/CEO’s employment agreement, annual goalsetting, the annual
performance assessment framework, and annual performance assessment. The
Performance Committee is also the appropriate venue through which the Board members
periodically engage in dialogue with the GM/CEO to discuss feedback regarding the
GM/CEO’s ongoing performance.
The Committee is responsible for monitoring performance metrics related to, and
progress toward, the agency’s Strategic Plan. The Committee will collaborate with the
GM/CEO to set the cadence, timing, and topics of performance updates relative to the
Strategic Plan when developing and adopting its annual committee work plan.
