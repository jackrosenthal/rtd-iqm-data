DIRECTOR REQUESTED AGENDA ITEM
To:

Board of Directors

Requested
by:

Vince Buzek, Director, District J

Date:

November 6, 2019

Subject:

Promotional Fare Pilot Program (“PFPP”) for
North Metro Line

Date: November 6, 2019

Board Meeting Date: November 19, 2019

Added to Committee Agenda as a Director initiated request pursuant to RTD Board Bylaws Art. VI,
Section 1(f). Requires formal motion and second at Committee meeting.
MOTION
It is recommended by Directors Buzek, Cook, Guissinger, Lubow, Rivera-Malpiede, Whitmore, Williams,
and Chair Tisdale at the Operations/Customer Services Committee meeting, that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager take all necessary steps to design and implement a Promotional
Fare Pilot Program (“PFPP”) and to deploy the first project in the program on the North Metro Line
commencing from its opening date and continuing for a period of six (6) months thereafter.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Increase Ridership
BACKGROUND
RTD has and is exploring means to increase ridership. In fact, increasing ridership is a 2020 Core Goal of
the General Manager. To that end, staff, Directors and others have been exploring the impact of a fare
reduction or flattening fares on ridership demand. This price elasticity of demand analysis is critical to
the RTD Mission. To advance this analysis, and in keeping with the goals of Reimagining RTD, this
proposal will create a pilot program on the soon-to-be-opened North Metro Line. This 6 month pilot
program will cause the fare for the entirety of the North Metro Line to be a Local fare notwithstanding
the fact that the two end of line stations are considered to be in a Regional fare zone. Depending on
outcome of the PFPP, this model may be used as a template to explore fare changes on similarly-situated
routes.
DISCUSSION
In its continuing effort to increase system ridership while simultaneously providing affordable
transportation services and maintaining fiscal sustainability, the Regional Transportation District shall
timely design and implement a Promotional Fare Pilot Program (“PFPP”).
Traveling through three Fare Zones on a corridor results in the rider having to pay a higher regional fare
rather than the lower local fare paid by riders traveling through less than three fare zones. The PFPP is
intended to explore, in a responsible way, what the impact would be of reducing these higher fares to
the same as that paid by local fare zone travelers. The assumption is that payment of the higher fare
may reasonably have the effect of reducing ridership, with the corollary assumption being that lowering
the rate should increase ridership.

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

The goals of the PFPP shall be:
o

o

To increase ridership by a designated factor, such factor to be determined in the development
of each pilot project, over RTD’s reasonable ridership estimates or actual statistics for any
corridor designated for the PFPP;
To test what percentage of lost fare revenue is recovered by an increase in ridership, and
evaluate effects on parking demand;

o

To gather data so as to inform the Re-Imagine study and/or subsequent reviews or
examinations of fare or zone changes

o

Over time, to better ascertain the relationship between fares, ridership, fare revenues, and
farebox recovery in the District
The PFPP would take advantage of the Promotional Fare exemption provision of applicable
federal law. An RTD rail or bus corridor operating under the PFPP shall charge a local fare
only during the period of its designation under the PFPP, unless the parameters of the PFPP
for a specific corridor demand otherwise.

o

All rail and bus corridors that traverse three fare zones, necessitating the payment of a regional fare,
may be eligible for inclusion in the PFPP, with the proviso that only one such corridor shall operate under
the PFPP at any given time, subject at all times to any applicable oversight or restrictions imposed by
regulatory agencies, including the Federal Transit Administration. For a variety of reasons, the North
Metro Commuter Rail Line (“N Line”) is a candidate for this pilot. These reasons include the N line’s
newness, the intense local interest in this subject on the N line, and because it will have available
technology to provide accurate ridership counts. Inclusion as a PFPP will mean that the N Line shall
charge riders a local fare only, starting from the opening date of the N Line until the date six months
following such opening.
At the conclusion of such six-month pilot period the agency shall examine ridership statistics, fare
revenue and parking demand to determine whether the N Line pilot enjoyed ridership growth meeting or
exceeding the designated factor (on an annualized basis) over the agency’s good faith reasonable
estimates or actual ridership statistics on the corridor. In the event that ridership did increase by at least
the designated factor for that corridor, the agency shall look at options for extending this fare and
expanding it to other areas.
STAFF DISCUSSION
BACKGROUND
Prior to the opening of the University of Colorado A Line, the RTD Board of Directors adopted a
consolidated fare structure that resulted in three fare categories: Local, Regional, and Airport. The new
fare structure was the outcome of a two-year process that included extensive public outreach and
engagement, exhaustive technical analysis (including a mandatory FTA Civil Rights Act Title VI fare
equity analysis), and thorough deliberation by the RTD Board of Directors.

Packet Pg. 4

1.B.1

The new fares were designed to simplify the way passengers pay for trips across RTD’s system and
were implemented on January 1, 2016. The rail fare zone categories are Zones A and B (Local), Zone C
(Regional) and the Airport Zone (Denver International Airport). Passengers traveling 1 or 2 zones pay the
Local fare and passengers traveling through 3 zones pay the Regional fare. Airport passengers pay the
Airport fare.
Charging a higher fare for longer distance, faster services is consistent with RTD’s past practice and fare
policies District-wide and was specifically retained as part of the 2016 Fare Policy due to concerns
regarding equity for those making shorter trips. Members of the public commenting on the proposed fare
changes at that time, as well as many elected officials, thought that traveling longer distances on rail
and premium buses warranted a higher fare. The option for traveling at a lower, Local fare, for these
longer distance trips remains for most passengers using the local/limited bus system.
Since 2016, bus fares for Regional and Express buses are based, consistently, on the rail zones. Routes
like the Flatiron Flyer, 120X, 122X and other routes serving Downtown Denver have their fares to and
from Downtown Denver based on the fare zones. Routes not serving Downtown Denver or having long
distances in Zone C have their fares based on the distances used in in determining a Local or Regional
fare for rail: 9.5 miles. Passenger trips traveling greater than 9.5 miles on an express or limited-stop
portion (generally freeway or expressway) require a Regional fare, while passenger trips less than 9.5
miles require a Local fare. These fares are accurately reflected in fare charts on the website and on the
schedules for each Regional route, as well as in the Trailblazer.
The boundary between Zones B and C, and thus a Local and Regional fare to Downtown Denver, is 9.5
miles from Union Station as noted above. The distances in RTD’s fare zones are concentric circles
centered on Union Station that do not take into account the length of the rail lines. RTD felt this was
important in order to assure that RTD passengers were treated as fairly and consistently as possible,
regardless of the difference between how far the station is from Union Station “as the crow flies,”
compared with the somewhat longer distance actually traversed by a Commuter or Light Rail Train (and
the Flatiron Flyer BRT). For example, while the Wheat Ridge-Ward Station on the G Line is 11 miles by
rail from Union Station, the rail line travels north for about 3.5 miles before turning southwest to reach
the end of the line and the straight-line distance is only 7.5 miles.
The Promotional Fare Pilot Project (PFPP) is proposed to respond to requests to expand the existing Rail
System Zone B (“Zone B”) to include two additional N Line stations: Northglenn-112th and Eastlake124th. The stations in question are 10.5 and 11.9 straight-line miles from Union Station, respectively.
Thornton Crossroads-104th is just inside the boundary at 9.4 miles.
The District has received similar requests since 2016 to expand the Local fare zone, including for
example the Jefferson County Government Center Station on the W Line. The narrative in the Discussion
section of this report highlights opportunities and issues associated with the N Line itself, as well as a
broader expansion to stations that would be included if the concept was expanded consistent with
RTD’s distance-based fare policy. To date, our message in response to Local fare zone expansion
requests has been consistent: we are unable to make exceptions to our fare zones for individual stations
or lines. Moving the fare zone boundary in a way that would make the entirety of the N Line a local fare

Packet Pg. 5

1.B.1

to Union Station would logically necessitate the inclusion of numerous additional stations on other Light
Rail and Commuter Rail lines in Zone B, two stations on the Flatiron Flyer, and the Wagon Road bus park
and ride.
The current PFPP proposal is to limit the expansion of the Local fare zone to only two N Line stations, as
noted above, for a limited period of time. There is a provision in the Federal Transit Administration’s
regulations regarding compliance with provisions of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to do so, for
up to a six-month period, as discussed below. Based upon previous dialogues and experience around this
topic, it is highly likely that other stakeholder jurisdictions will expect similar treatment, so we have
outlined some potential implications for Board consideration.
Also note that staff is preparing to undertake, in 2020, an analysis of various fare structure changes,
including an analysis of flat fares, with estimates of fare revenue changes and anticipated ridership
response. This work is to be modeled using the tools developed in support of the recent fare analyses
and with assistance from four nines technologies, the firm that assisted in analysis for the past studies.
DISCUSSION
As noted, the PFPP is proposed to respond to requests to expand the existing Rail System Zone B
(“Zone B”) to include two additional N Line stations: Northglenn-112th and Eastlake-124th. The PFPP can
afford RTD the opportunity to conduct a before and after analysis of impacts to fare revenue, ridership
and parking demand in isolation to help provide better information for future fare analyses and policy
decision-making. The following sections discuss a number of technical and policy considerations
regarding the PFPP implementation.
Parking Impacts: On the N Line, the station at Thornton Crossroads-104th has the largest parking
capacity at 880 cars. This station is also the last station within Zone B and a local fare to Downtown
Denver under RTD’s current Board-adopted fare structure. The two stations farther north at Northglenn112th and Eastlake-124th have a combined capacity of 720 cars (310 and 410, respectively) and, absent
the PFPP, passengers opting to drive farther to the greater capacity at Thornton Crossroads-104th will
have the advantage of more plentiful parking and a lower fare. Charging a local fare at all stations could
overburden the smaller parking facilities farther north on the N Line, making for a more difficult parking
situation.
Having additional stations with a Local fare to Downtown would also place additional parking demand on
several stations that currently experience full occupancy on a regular basis. The current Local and
Regional fare boundary helps to balance parking demand by encouraging some customers to drive to
parking facilities with available space in exchange for a lower fare to Downtown Denver.
Title VI Implications: RTD strives to operate a socially equitable transit system, where services,
resources, benefits, and adverse effects are shared in a fair and nondiscriminatory manner. As a
recipient of federal financial assistance, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) requires that RTD
promote social equity in compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Executive Order
12898 (Environmental Justice). Specifically, the FTA requires that all fare changes are subject to equity
analyses and public feedback. Equity analyses are an evaluation of permanent fare changes for

Packet Pg. 6

1.B.1

disproportionate impacts on low-income and minority populations. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of
1964 and Executive Order 12898 (Environmental Justice) prohibit recipients of federal funds from
implementing policies that have the effect of disproportionately impacting low-income and minority
populations.
Over the past four years, RTD has conducted two fare studies to develop fare policies that equitably
meet our fare revenue targets. Any proposal to revise our distance-based fare structure will require a
detailed analysis of revenue and equity impacts. RTD has not subjected the creation of a fare zone
exception for the N Line to an equity analysis or public feedback. Deviating from our current fare zone
policy without conducting an equity analysis or soliciting public feedback violates federal requirements,
jeopardizing current and future federal funding. Further, should the policy change result in
disproportionate impacts, RTD would be exposed to lawsuits under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of
1964.
FTA regulations do allow a very small set of exceptions to their fare equity analysis requirements, one in
particular referred to as a “promotional fare reduction.” If a promotional or temporary fare reduction lasts
six months or longer, then FTA considers the fare reduction permanent and the transit provider must
conduct a fare equity analysis. After the proposed promotional fare period on the N Line ends, RTD
would need to revert from a Local fare back to a Regional fare and then conduct a fare equity analysis to
determine the implications of the Local fare. In any case, RTD could not start another promotional fare
period without conducting a complete District-wide fare equity analysis.
Before and After Analysis: As noted above, a six-month PFPP implementation of Local fares on the N
Line would afford RTD and our stakeholders with a real-world demonstration of the impacts of distancebased fares on fare revenues, ridership and parking demand. RTD will be able to collect information on
each of these both before (during the six-month PFPP period) and then after the conclusion of the PFPP.
This information can be used in future analyses and will provide technical and policy insights that can
inform future decision-making.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Staff has estimated that the six-month promotional fare would result in a fare loss of approximately
$180,000 – based on the relative inelasticity of demand for transit relative to fare changes, and the
revenue differences between the average Local fare compared to the average Regional fare. RTD staff
has not estimated the revenue loss for other individual corridors.
Also note that implementation of fare changes will require staff resources and money, an estimate of
which staff has not had the time to prepare and which would vary based on Board Direction relative to
the scope of the preferred PFPP implementation. These could include but are not limited to: costs to
conduct the before and after analysis; costs to reprogram Ticket Vending Machines; needs associated
with adjusting back-office accounting and customer facing interfaces; resources required for
communications and customer information efforts, printing and advertising, etc.

Re:

Service Availability – October 2019

RTD fixed-route bus operations provided slightly over 99.30% of all scheduled hours of bus
service in October 2019. Lost service hours for personnel related reasons, reflects a fairly
consistent number compared the same month (October) last year. Service delivery overall has
stabilized and been consistent since July 2018. Lost service for personnel related reasons
follows:





October 2019 – 485.37 hours
October 2018 – 420.01 hours
Year to date hours for 2019 – 3,065.26 hours
Year to date hours 2018 – 9,747.46 hours

Contributing to our service/staffing challenges in October were 4 severe weather days, special
events and planned bus bridges (events include: CU Buff Ride, Zombie Crawl, Hot Chocolate
Classic, Rock-n-Roll Half Marathon, and Broncos Ride).
While RTD did provide in excess of 99.30% of all scheduled hours of service in the month, it
was necessary to cover 2,925 shifts with operators working a 6th day (one of their scheduled
days off). This represents approximately 23,400 hours of service being provided by a “6th day”
RTD operator and does not include the mandated service hours provided by our contractor
partners, First Transit and TransDev.

The Regional Transportation District (RTD) offers two dedicated transit services for customers
with disabilities: Access-a-Ride and Access-a-Cab. Both services are for passengers who are
unable to use other RTD services by themselves due to physical or cognitive disabilities.
Passengers have to be certified for paratransit use under the eligibility guidelines of the
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) to use either service. Access-a-Ride provides curbside and
door-to-door transit services on a shared-ride vehicle. Passengers have to make reservations for
Access-a-Ride trips in advance and must pay varying fares depending on their destinations
(ranging from $5.00 for a local trip to $20.00 for the airport, each way). Access-a-Ride is
available during the same days and hours as RTD’s local bus services.
Access-a-Cab is a RTD-subsidized taxi service that is designed to help alleviate some of the
demand for Access-a-Ride. Passengers pay the first $2 of the fare to their destinations, and RTD
pays up to $12 of the remaining fare. RTD operates the service through several local taxi
companies. Passengers have to make reservations for Access-a-Cab trips in advance and must
make those reservations through RTD.

As part of improving services for people with disabilities, RTD commissioned BBC Research &
Consulting (BBC) to conduct a survey with Access-a-Ride and Access-a-Cab customers. BBC used
the survey to gather customer insights about various aspects of Access-a-Ride and Access-a-Cab
services. RTD will use information from the survey to identify service areas that need
improvement and to better serve customers with disabilities.

SECTION I.
Introduction

1.C.3.a

BBC worked with RTD to conduct the survey over a two-week period beginning in July 2019. The
survey was distributed to customers who had completed an Access-a-Ride or Access-a-Cab trip
during the six months preceding survey distribution. Participants completed the survey either
via telephone or online. Customers who provided RTD with a valid email address were contacted
via email and were given the option of either completing the survey online or calling a toll-free
telephone number to complete the survey via telephone. Customers for whom RTD did not have
an email address on file were contacted via telephone and were given the option to either
complete the survey via telephone or online. Participants who could not participate in the survey
immediately were given the option to schedule a call-back to take the survey at a later time.

Participants

RTD provided BBC with a list of recent Access-a-Ride and Access-a-Cab passengers. The BBC
project team used random sampling to contact passengers from the list and invite them to
participate in the survey. The study team conducted the survey with 405 passengers via
telephone and 97 passengers via web.

Survey Instrument

The instrument that RTD and BBC used to conduct the survey was similar to the instrument that
RTD and BBC used for the 2016 Access-a-Ride and Access-a-Cab customer survey. BBC worked
with RTD to update the survey and format it as both telephone and online surveys. Each survey
was programmed to ensure compliance with Section 508 of the United States Workforce
Rehabilitation Act. The online survey was compatible with assistive devices (e.g., screen readers)
and took into account people who may be color blind. The telephone survey was administered to
interact with people using special assistive telephone equipment. The survey covered many
topics related to Access-a-Ride and Access-a-Cab services including:




Insights related to various aspects of participants’ most recent trips;
Experiences with RTD over the past six months;

Participants’ transit behaviors and demographic characteristics.

Appendix A presents the full instrument that RTD and BBC used for the survey.

SECTION II.
Methodology

1.C.3.a

BBC analyzed survey results to provide information that will allow RTD to assess customer
experiences with Access-A-Ride and Access-A-Cab services. In most cases, the project team
compared survey results between Access-a-Ride (n = 321) and Access-a-Cab (n = 167)
passengers.1 Web participants differed from telephone participants in terms of area of residence.
Specifically, whereas a greater proportion of web/online participants lived in Arapahoe county
than telephone participants, a greater proportion of telephone participants lived in Denver
county than web/online participants. To appropriately integrate web responses, RTD provided
BBC with customer ZIP code information, which the study team used to develop appropriate
survey weights. County-based weights were then applied to the data prior to analysis. As
appropriate, the study team made determinations of statistical significance at the α = .05 and α =
.01 levels using two-tailed tests. Unless otherwise noted, all differences reported in the text
between Access-a-Ride and Access-a-Cab were statistically significant at the α = .05 level. In
addition, where appropriate, the study team compared results from the 2019 survey to the 2016
survey.

Participant Characteristics

BBC assessed key demographic and household characteristics of survey participants. Figure 1
presents key results from the project team’s analyses of those characteristics. As shown in
Figure 1:







Nearly 60 percent of participants reported being non-Hispanic whites;

Ten percent of participants reported speaking a language other than English at home;

More than 40 percent of participants reported household incomes of less than $22,500;

Nearly 80 percent of participants reported having a physical or mobility-related disability;

Seventy percent of participants reported using assistive devices for mobility or hearing; and
Nearly seventy percent of participants reported not having a valid driver’s license.

1 Fourteen participants did not know/remember whether they rode Access-a-Ride or Access-a-Cab on their most recent trip

and were therefore removed from all comparative analyses.

Participants were asked how many Access-a-Ride/Access-a-Cab trips they had taken in the past
month. On average, participants indicated that they had taken seven trips in the past month
(mean = 7.15). Number of trips in the past month did not differ significantly between Access-aRide and Access-a-Cab passengers (Access-a-Ride mean = 7.49; Access-a-Cab mean = 6.62).

Trip Purpose

Survey participants indicated the primary purpose for their most recent
Access-a-Ride/Access-a-Cab trip. Figure 2 presents those results separately for Access-a-Ride
and Access-a-Cab passengers.

Half of Access-a-Ride passengers reported that the primary purpose of their most recent trip was
to or from a medical appointment. Similarly, Access-a-Cab passengers were also most likely to
indicate that the primary purpose of their most recent trip was to or from a medical
appointment. However, Access-a-Ride passengers were more likely than Access-a-Cab
passengers to report that a medical appointment was the primary purpose of their trip (Accessa-Ride = 50%; Access-a-Cab = 39%). Access-a-Ride passengers were also more likely than
Access-a-Cab passengers to report that the primary purpose of their trip was for social or
entertainment purposes (Access-a-Ride = 18%; Access-a-Cab = 11%) or commuting to/from
work (Access-a-Ride = 13%; Access-a-Cab = 3%). In contrast, Access-a-Cab passengers were
more likely than Access-a-Ride passengers to report that the primary purpose of their most
recent trip was to engage in shopping or eating out (Access-a-Cab = 27%; Access-a-Ride = 4%) or
personal business (Access-a-Cab = 19%; Access-a-Ride = 11%).

Survey participants indicated their satisfaction with their most recent Access-a-Ride/Access-aCab trip by rating their overall satisfaction with the trip as well as the likelihood that they will
choose Access-a-Ride/Access-a-Cab for a future trip. They also rated their satisfaction with the
value of their most recent ride. The study team compared results from the 2019 survey to the
2016 survey.

Access-a-Ride satisfaction. Figure 3 presents overall trip satisfaction, likelihood to choose
again, and value results for Access-a-Ride passengers. There were no statistically significant

Interactive Voice Response System

Survey participants were asked if they currently receive messages from RTD’s Interactive Voice
Response (IVR) system about trip information. Access-a-Ride passengers were more likely to
indicate that they receive messages from the IVR system than Access-a-Cab passengers (Accessa-Ride = 68%; Access-a-Cab = 43%). The survey asked about participants’ satisfaction with the
IVR system overall and the accuracy of information provided by the system. Participants rated
their satisfaction with those aspects on a scale from 1 (very dissatisfied) to 5 (very satisfied).
Figure 5 presents those results. Participants were satisfied with the accuracy of information

Access-a-Cab Satisfaction

1.C.3.a

The vast majority of both Access-a-Ride and Access-a-Cab passengers indicated that they
scheduled their most recent trip themselves (Access-a-Ride = 84%; Access-a-Cab = 89%). The
survey asked several questions of those participants about the scheduling and reservation
process associated with their most recent Access-a-Ride/Access-a-Cab trip. Those questions
assessed the type of reservation that participants made for their trip, whether participants were
able to schedule their trip at their desired time, and participants’ satisfaction with various
aspects of the reservation process.

Type of reservation. Participants were asked whether the type of reservation for their most

recent trip was a subscription/standing appointment or a single trip. Figure 6 presents those
results. Most participants indicated that their most recent trip was a single trip rather than a
standing appointment (Access-a-Ride = 74%; Access-a-Cab = 80%). A larger percentage of
Access-a-Ride passengers than Access-a-Cab passengers indicated that their reservations were
for a subscription/standing appointment (Access-a-Ride = 21%; Access-a-Cab = 16%).

passengers were contacted by RTD dispatch prior to their scheduled trip (Access-a-Ride = 55%;
Access-a-Ride = 38%). That difference was statistically significant.
Survey participants who reported receiving a call from an RTD dispatcher were also asked to

Overall, participants were satisfied with the timeliness of their most recent trip, but Access-aCab passengers were more satisfied than Access-a-Ride passengers with timeliness. Out of all of
the aspects of timeliness, the on-time performance overall and the on-time performance of the
pickup had the lowest satisfaction ratings. Access-a-Cab passengers rated directness of the route

The survey asked participants about Access-a-Ride/Access-a-Cab operator performance.
Questions included the participants’ satisfaction with various aspects of operator performance
and whether the operator engaged in specific behaviors, such as offering door-to-door service
and announcing himself/herself.

Satisfaction. Participants rated their satisfaction, on a scale from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent), with
six different aspects of the vehicle operator’s performance on their most recent
Access-a-Ride/Access-a-Cab trip. Participants were asked to rate the:


Courtesy of the driver;

Driver’s knowledge of the area;

Driver’s ability to answer questions about service;
Driver’s sensitivity to passenger needs;

Helping with belongings.

Figure 11 presents those results. Access-a-Ride and Access-a-Cab passengers indicated that they
were very satisfied with the various aspects of the vehicle operator’s performance on their most
recent trip. Access-a-Ride passengers gave higher ratings than Access-a-Cab passengers for
helping with belongings (Access-a-Ride mean = 4.73; Access-a-Cab mean = 4.38) and assistance

Operator behaviors. Participants were also asked about two behaviors that RTD expects of
Door-to-door service. Participants indicated whether the operator offered door-to-door service
on their most recent Access-a-Ride/Access-a-Cab trip. As shown in Figure 12, a larger
percentage of Access-a-Cab passengers than Access-a-Ride passengers were not offered door-todoor service (Access-a-Cab = 18%; Access-a-Ride = 9%).
Operator announcement. Participants also indicated whether the operator announced
himself/herself on their most recent Access-a-Ride/Access-a-Cab trip (e.g., “Hello, my name is
_____ with Access-a-Ride. Are you ____?”). As shown in Figure 12, more Access-a-Ride passengers
than Access-a-Cab passengers reported that the operator announced himself/herself on their
most recent trip (Access-a-Ride = 84%, Access-a-Cab = 61%).

Frequency of operator behaviors. Participants were asked to indicate how often they have been
offered door-to-door service and how often they have been greeted by name considering all of
their Access-a-Ride/Access-a-Cab trips in the past six months on a scale from 1 (never) to 5
(every time). In general, participants indicated that they are offered door-to-door service very
often as part of their Access-a-Ride/Access-a-Cab trips, but Access-a-Ride passengers reported
being offered door-to-door service more frequently than Access-a-Cab passengers (Access-aRide mean = 4.31; Access-a-Cab mean = 3.99). That difference was statistically significant.
Similarly, although participants indicated that the driver announces him/herself very often as
part of their Access-a-Ride/Access-a-Cab trips, Access-a-Ride passengers indicated that they
were more frequently greeted by name than Access-a-Cab passengers (Access-a-Ride

over the past six months on a scale from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent). Participants indicated high
satisfaction with Access-a-Ride/Access-a-Cab overall (mean = 4.17). That did not differ
significantly from 2016 survey results (mean = 4.20).

Experiences with RTD

Survey participants were also asked several questions about their general experiences with RTD
outside of Access-a-Ride/Access-a-Cab.

Length of RTD ridership. Participants were asked how long they had been riding RTD

services. Figure 14 presents those results. Most participants indicated that they had been riding
RTD for three or more years (Access-a-Ride = 67%; Access-a-Cab = 62%). There were no
significant differences in length of RTD ridership between Access-a-Ride and Access-a-Cab
passengers.

RTD services in the past 12 months. Survey participants were asked which of the following
RTD services they used in the past 12 months:






Light rail/train;
Bus;

Skyride;

Call-n-Ride;

16th Street Mall Shuttle; and/or
Free MetroRide.

The study team compared 2019 to 2016 survey results. Figure 15 presents those results.
Participants most frequently indicated that they had not used any RTD services other than
Access-a-Ride or Access-a-Cab in the past 12 months. However, 2016 participants (56%) were
more likely to say they had not used any other services than 2019 participants (47%). That
difference was statistically significant at the α = .01 level. Compared to 2016 participants, 2019
participants were more likely to indicate they had used bus, light rail/train, and MetroRide
services in the past 12 months.

rail/train and bus trips they took in past week. The study team compared 2019 to 2016 survey
results. Figure 16 presents those results. Overall, participants reported taking fewer light
rail/train trips in 2019 (mean = 1.71) than they did in 2016 (mean = 2.19). That difference was
statistically significant. Participants also reported taking fewer bus trips in 2019 (mean = 2.57)
than in 2016 (mean = 3.03), but that difference was not significant.

Device ownership. Survey participants indicated whether they owned a cellular phone, smart

phone, tablet, and/or a personal computer. Figure 17 presents those results. The majority of
Access-a-Ride and Access-a-cab participants indicated that they own a cellular phone, but
Access-a-Cab passengers were more likely than Access-a-Ride passengers to own a cellular
phone (Access-a-Cab = 79%; Access-a-Ride = 73%). However, Access-a-Ride passengers were
more likely to indicate that they own a personal computer (Access-a-Ride = 48%; Access-a-Cab =

Third-party applications. Participants were asked to indicate whether they used any third-

party applications to obtain transportation services in the Denver or Boulder areas in the past
six months. Figure 18 presents those results. Overall, most participants said they had not used a
third-party application to do so (57%). However, a larger percentage of Access-a-Ride
passengers than Access-a-Cab passengers indicated that they had not used a third-party
application to obtain transportation services in the past six months (Access-a-Ride = 63%;
Access-a-Cab = 45%). More Access-a-Cab passengers than Access-a-Ride passengers indicated
that they had used traditional taxi cab service (Access-a-Cab = 37%; Access-a-Ride = 16%).

work; on a mobile device; or by other means. Figure 19 presents those results. Twenty-six
percent of all participants stated that they did not access the Internet, and that percentage did
not differ significantly between Access-a-Ride passengers and Access-a-Cab passengers (Accessa-Ride = 24%; Access-a-Cab = 30%). Access-a-Ride passengers were more likely to indicate that
they access the Internet at home or work (Access-a-Ride = 58%; Access-a-Cab = 48%) or on a

The 2019 Access-A-Ride/Access-A-Cab Survey revealed importation information that RTD can
use to assess factors that impact customers’ experiences with those services. Key results from
the 2019 Access-A-Ride/Access-A-Cab Survey include:


On their most recent trip, a greater percentage of Access-a-Ride than Access-a-Cab
passengers:
 Used the service for travelling to or from a medical appointment, a
social/entertainment engagement, or commuting to or from work;
 Had a subscription or standing appointment;

 Were contacted by RTD dispatch prior to the trip;

 Were offered door-to-door service; and




 Were greeted by the driver.

On their most recent trip, a greater percentage of Access-a-Cab passengers than Access-aRide passengers used the service for personal business or to go shopping or eat out.
Access-a-Ride passengers were more likely to indicate they currently receive messages
from RTD’s Interactive Voice Response system.

There were no significant differences between 2019 and 2016 survey results in terms of
overall trip satisfaction, likelihood to choose again, and ride value. There were also no
significant differences between overall satisfaction with Access-a-Ride and Access-a-Cab in
the past six months between 2019 and 2016 survey results. Access-a-Ride and Access-a-Cab
customers continue to be satisfied with their trip experiences.
Access-a-Ride passengers gave higher ratings of satisfaction than Access-a-Cab passengers
on all aspects of their most recent reservation experiences. Access-a-Ride passengers also
gave higher ratings of satisfaction than Access-a-Cab passengers on all aspects of operator
performance and safety and security on their most recent trip.
Access-a-Cab passengers gave higher ratings of satisfaction than Access-a-Ride passengers
on all aspects of timeliness related to their most recent trip.
Access-a-Cab passengers were more satisfied with vehicle noise level than Access-a-Ride
passengers.
Access-a-Ride passengers rated the ease of boarding and exiting the vehicle higher than
Access-a-Cab passengers.

2019 survey participants were more likely than 2016 participants to have used bus, light
rail/train, and MetroRide services in the past 12 months.

2019 survey participants reported taking fewer light rail/train trips in the past week than
2016 survey participants.

• When asked to rate their satisfaction with RTD paratransit services over
the past six months, ratings are similar to 2016.
• Once again, because differences in values are not statistically significant,
we assume random chance is the cause.

I POLICY
The first element of the Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan is Safety Policy. This is at its most
simple, the safety policy developed, approved and signed by the District. However, this element also
describes RTD’s commitment to safety, its objectives and safety goals and the organizational structure
established and plans written to obtain these goals and objectives.
RTD is a multimodal agency comprised of light rail, commuter rail, bus, and special services.
RTD's mission is to meet its constituents’ present and future public transit needs by providing safe, clean,
reliable, courteous, accessible, and cost-effective service throughout the District. In accordance with the
directives of Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act, (MAP-21) and Fixing America’s
Surface Transportation (FAST) Act, RTD undertook the conversion of the System Safety Program Plan
(SSPP) into the Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP) in 2018. The PTASP consists of a
series of policies and procedures, which must be undertaken to ensure the safety of its customers,
employees, emergency responders, and the general public. Development of the PTASP was completed in
accordance with Title 49 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Chapter 53, Colorado Public Utilities
Commission (PUC) State Safety Oversight (SSO) Program Procedures and Standards 49 CFR Part 674;
Federal Transportation Administration (FTA) and Federal Railroad Administration rules and regulations
(FRA). The PTASP is the system-wide governing safety document for all transit modes operated by RTD.
The RTD PTASP has adopted a Safety Management System (SMS) approach to administering safety
throughout the organization. SMS is flexible and scalable and consists of four elements as described in
the following table.
SMS Element
Safety Policy
Safety Risk Management
Safety Assurance

Safety Promotion

Description
Definition of safety policies, procedures and
organizational structure
Formal process for management of hazards to
an acceptable level of risk
Establishment of process measures, assessments
and controls to assess the effectiveness of risk
control strategies
Safety training and risk communication practices to
promote a culture of safety

Described throughout the PTASP are: RTD’s safety policies and procedures; safety risk management in
the form of RTD’s hazard management program; safety assurance mainly accomplished through RTD’s
internal safety review program; and training and practices to support safety promotion.

1.C.4.a

The Regional Transportation District (RTD) is a special transportation district of the State of Colorado
and authorized under Colorado Revised Statutes Title 32, Article 9. As such, the District has its own
taxing power and operates within the counties of Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Broomfield, Denver,
Douglas, and Jefferson. The District is managed by a fifteen member elected Board of Directors who have
authorized the RTD General Manager to develop and implement a comprehensive and integrated Public
Transportation Agency Safety Plan. To that end, the General Manager, by signature authority of the
District’s Safety Policy Statement, has authorized the RTD Chief Safety Officer, Assistant General
Manager of Safety, Security and Asset Management to develop and implement a Public Transportation
Agency Safety Plan as an operating document of the District for all modes of operations including
commuter rail, light rail, and bus/paratransit. RTD’s contractors, including RTD’s commuter rail operator
– Denver Transit Partners - are also governed under this Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan.
In April 2005, the U.S. Congress expanded the FTA regulatory role by granting authority to develop state
safety oversight programs, as defined by 49 CFR 659 - Final Rule, Rail Fixed Guideway Systems; State
Safety Oversight.
The FTA recognizes Colorado PUC, as the state safety oversight agency for RTD. PUC-SSO is FTA's
certified safety oversight agency, working cooperatively to regulate RTD's light rail transit, by ensuring
compliance with state and federal requirements, regulations, and guidance, as applicable.
The FTA functions as both an administrator of funds for capital projects and as a federal regulator as
defined by 49 CFR 674, 670 and 673. The FTA conducts regular reviews of the state safety oversight
agency (PUC- SSOA), to determine the SSO's and RTD's compliance to the FTA's general requirements.
RTD's light rail service is regulated by the FTA, and PUC SSO agencies.
RTD's commuter rail service is fully regulated by the FRA, and is not regulated by the PUC- SSO
(excepting at-grade crossings), or the FTA.

I 1.3

Ensuring that all staff are provided with appropriate safety-related information, equipment and
training
Establishing and measuring our safety performance against realistic, data-driven safety
performance indicators and targets
Continually improving our safety performance through management processes that ensure
appropriate actions are taken and assuring effectiveness
Ensuring externally supplied systems and services meet RTD’s safety performance standards.

RTD utilizes a Safety Management System (SMS) to prevent accidents, to reduce risk of injury and
minimize damage to property and equipment. We will work proactively towards identifying and reducing
the existence of hazards and risks in the workplace and in our system.
As the Accountable Executive for all operations and activities I will ensure that resources are available to
ensure our SMS is robust and successful. RTD management will take steps to prevent workplace
incidents, injuries, and illnesses and will provide support of safety program initiatives. They will consider
employee suggestions for achieving a safer, healthier workplace; keep informed about workplace safety
and health hazards, and regularly review the company safety programs.
RTD managers and supervisors are responsible for supervising and training workers in safe work
practices. They are expected to reinforce safe work and behaviors and compliance with company safety
rules and work to eliminate hazardous conditions. Managers and Supervisors will lead safety efforts by
example.
All RTD employees are expected and encouraged to participate in safety activities including reporting
hazards, reporting unsafe work practices, near misses, and accidents immediately to their supervisor or a
safety committee/department representative. All employees will wear required personal protective
equipment (PPE) and participate in and support safety activities. Employees will serve as Safety
Ambassadors by working safely, complying with requirements and serving as an example to others.
Disciplinary action will not be taken against an employee who acts to prevent an injury or who reports
any accident, incident, concern or hazard. All employees are required to abide by the standards and
procedures set forth in the SMS policy and the Public Transit Agency Safety Plan (PTASP). Behaviors,
such as illegal activity, negligence, acts of willful misconduct, or undue care and attention shall be
considered outside the scope of this policy.
The SMS Program is managed under my authority by the Chief Safety and Security Officer who reports
directly to me. All levels of management and all employees are accountable for the delivery of the highest
level of safety performance, starting with the General Manager and CEO.

Goals and Objectives

Attachment: 2020 RTD TASP -Final - pdf 11-1-19 (3993 : 2020 Public Transit Agency Safety Plan)

I2

The RTD Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP) establishes formal structure and
processes to be used by RTD to identify, assess, track, control, minimize, and resolve hazards
associated with RTD bus and rail systems. The PTASP will be used as a means of preventing
injuries, incidents, system disruption, accidents, environmental damage, and other losses. It
demonstrates RTD's commitment to safety and compliance through loss prevention programs.
The plan is consistent with federal, state, and local regulations, and it sets forth procedures to
comply with standards and conditions of industry, 49 CFR Part 674, PUC's SSO Program
Standards, and applicable FRA rules and regulations applicable to Commuter Rail as contained in
49 CFR.
The PTASP applies to the planning, design, procurement, construction, activation, operations,
and maintenance services of the bus and rail system. The PTASP is approved by the General
manager /CEO and implemented under the direction of the Chief Safety Officer, the Senior
Leadership team, and Executive Safety and Security Committee (ESSC). RTD embraces and
participates with the Colorado Department of Transportation in achieving the state wide goal of
“Zero Fatalities” program. “This is a goal that everyone can live with”.
RTD's annual objectives for 2020 are:
 Zero Fatalities in RTD operating systems; Bus, Light Rail and Commuter Rail
 Preventable accident rate per 100,000 miles:
o Bus less than 2.0
 10% reduction in Light Rail preventable accidents
 10% reduction in Commuter Rail preventable accidents
 25% reduction of Lost time employee injuries
 15% reduction of OJI’s
o 25% reduction of Slip and Fall injuries
o 25% reduction of injuries from strains
The overall consideration in the development of the RTD PTASP is to provide safe and reliable
movement of passengers throughout the transit system. The passengers and the general public
must be confident that the RTD transit system is a safe system. To achieve this it is necessary to
design, construct and maintain a system that is free from recognized hazards with the safety of
employees, passengers and the general public in mind. RTD’s objectives will be met by drawing
information from system observation, local and state codes, federal guidelines, and specific RTD
requirements into a unified document to ensure a safe transportation system.

Continue to train management and employees on SMS, new SMS processes and their
roles and key expectations in making SMS successful at RTD.

Goals

The goal of RTD's PTASP is to utilize and achieve the highest practical level of safety in order to
protect passengers, employees, emergency responders, contractors, invitees, and property. At a
minimum, the PTASP ensures the following processes are incorporated into RTD's system safety
programs, plans, processes, and practices to achieve its goals to:
 Define the physical, functional, and operational characteristics of its transit system with
its potential impact to people, equipment, infrastructure, facilities, and its operating
environment.
 Identify hazards or undesired events by examining historical data, causes, and
contributing factors.
 Provide a level of safety that is consistent with transit bus and rail standards.
 Assess risks by balancing the potential frequency of a hazard occurring against the
severity of the event, and quantify the event into acceptable or unacceptable categories.
 Eliminate, mitigate, or control unacceptable or undesirable hazards to acceptable levels.
 Determine if RTD's goals and objectives were achieved.
 Monitor hazard resolution effectiveness and determine if there are unexpected hazards.
 Comply with federal, state, and local rules and regulations.
 Continually improve and evaluate the Safety Management System and the processes that
support the SMS.
 Ensure that all customers perceive the system is safe and secure by maintaining a high
level of safety comparable to other transit systems as measured by maintaining a good
safety record, and by maintaining the visual aspects of the system in good repair

Integrating Safety into all Aspects of RTD

The objective of safety at RTD is the continual improvement of our processes and operations to
maximize safety to the highest practicable level. This effort is undertaken by providing continual
opportunities for employees to be reminded of safety, incorporate safe practices into their
operations, and multiple means for each employee to identify potential hazards.
We accomplish this through Safety Moments at RTD meetings, Safety committee meetings,
weekly Safety messages, safety poster campaigns, identification and mitigation of hazards,
proactive reviews and inspections to identify potential hazards.
Within the different departments, multiple means of incorporating safety are presented. As

RTD Board of Directors and Executive Staff
Attachment: 2020 RTD TASP -Final - pdf 11-1-19 (3993 : 2020 Public Transit Agency Safety Plan)

I 3.1

RTD was created in 1969, by the 47th Colorado General Assembly for the purpose of providing a
public mass transportation system for RTD communities, and began operation in 1972. A 15member elected board of directors, which is the legislative body for RTD and determines all
questions of overall governance policy for RTD. RTD's board of directors appoints the General
Manager and chief executive officer (GM/CEO), who is ultimately responsible for safety.
The CEO has full charge of the acquisition, construction, maintenance, and operations of the
system and facilities of RTD, and of the administration of RTD business affairs. The CEO
supervises executive staff of chief department officers and Assistant General Managers. Included
in these officers, the chief operations officer is responsible for bus and rail transit operations. The
chief safety and security officer has responsibility for corporate safety. The safety department
reports monthly to the GM/CEO and executive staff during meetings of the Executive Safety and
Security Committee (ESSC)

The Executive Safety and Security Committee is the safety and security authority for the District
and has the following authority and responsibilities: to set and implement policies; to review and
approve rules and procedures; to assure the District’s safety and security goals and objectives are

Management—Key Role in Safety Overview

RTD's safety program is incorporated into every aspect of transit services, by rail and bus service
managers. Safe operations of bus and rail units are the responsibility of the Assistant General
Managers (AGM). Each operating division has an appointed AGM, who along with managers and
supervisors are responsible for implementing policies and procedures for safe operations. The
assistant general managers of the rail and bus units have charged their management teams to
effectively manage safety, and to develop safety programs, plans, procedures, training, policies,
and rules to govern safety; and to fully comply with the PTASP. Bus and rail maintenance
facilities are staffed with a manager of maintenance responsible for the safe operation of the
facility, and are supported by shift supervisors and maintenance workers during their performing
maintenance, servicing, and inspection. It is the RTD’s policy to comply with OSHA and FRA
regulations. RTD develops policies and procedures for occupational safety and health in
compliance with OSHA and applicable FRA regulations.
Supervisors' responsibilities place them at the forefront of RTD's rail and bus services safety
efforts. A significant portion of their duty is to serve as frontline safety specialists; monitoring,
ensuring, and emphasizing safety performance, rules compliance, and promoting a strong safety
climate. All employees are charged with adhering to safety, but supervisors are RTD's key to

improved safety-related behavior, and positive safety outcomes. Supervisors have the
responsibility to monitor safety compliance of their employees and ascertain that employees
understand their job functions and the safety requirements of that job.

Attachment: 2020 RTD TASP -Final - pdf 11-1-19 (3993 : 2020 Public Transit Agency Safety Plan)

RTD safety and health are managed at the lowest levels. Each employee is trained in safety, job
duties, and given responsibility for their own safety and the safety with whom he/she works. All
employees have the authority to halt an operation if it is deemed to be unsafe. RTD's system
safety processes emphasize open and fair dialog between leaders and subordinates to increase the
commitment to safety at all levels.
In an oversight role, transit safety specialists report to the Manager of Safety, who reports to the
Senior Manager, Safety and Environmental, who reports to the chief safety officer. Transit safety
specialists have a role in executing the functions necessary to ensure safety, to include the
following:
 Coordinate safety activities of the agency.
 Compile safety data and perform analysis to identify and assess operational risk.
 Assist in the investigation of accidents and incidents as appropriate.
 Evaluate hazard resolutions proposed by departments.
 Perform analysis to identify and resolve hazards.
 Evaluate proposed system modifications from a safety perspective.
 Conduct safety reviews and inspections.
 Provide safety support such as field and laboratory testing.
 Regulatory Reporting, including creation and submittal of PUC required Corrective
Action Plans and updates.
The Safety Department will conduct regularly scheduled internal safety reviews to evaluate
compliance and conformance with RTD's PTASP, PUC-SSO Program Standards 49 CFR Part
674; and 49 CFR 673. Transit safety specialists serve as alternates to each other. Transit safety
specialists work closely with management and employees, through various processes and
committees, and have authority to determine compliance. When warranted, transit safety
specialists may issue corrective action plans (CAP), and ensure appropriate departments
implement those plans. Transit safety specialists are the designated contacts to regulatory
agencies, and serve as alternate contacts to the PUC-SSO oversight agency.

Climate / Geography

The Denver Metro region normally has a semi-arid continental climate with four well-defined
seasons. Summers are characterized by hot, dry weather, but the high temperatures are usually not
oppressive since the relative humidity is generally low and the nights usually cool. August is the
hottest month with temperatures reading 90– 100 degrees F. Winters are cold, but usually not
severe. The average annual snowfall is less than 65 inches at the Denver airport but much higher
amounts fall in foothill locations. Precipitation is generally light during the summer and early fall
but may be heavy in the spring when storms from the Pacific Ocean are moving through the area
more frequently than at any other season of the year.
The RTD transit services extend throughout the Front Range Area approximately 60 miles wide
(E-W) between Pine Junction, Denver and Denver International Airport. The area also ranges
from Longmont on the north to Lone Tree on the South, a distance of 70 Miles. Service areas
include the foothills situated along the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains. Elevations range
from approximately 4,850 feet above sea level to greater than 9000 feet above sea level in the
foothills.

I 5 TRANSIT SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
I 5.1

Light Rail System Description

The RTD light rail system was designed as the first piece of a planned regional rapid transit
system. In 1989, the Colorado Supreme Court declared that the Denver metro area Regional
Transportation District was eligible to collect a Use Tax that enabled the District to accumulate
funding of $67 million for construction of a rail system.
The project was approved by DRCOG (Denver Regional Council of Governments) in 1991 and
construction on the initial 5.3 mile rail system and a functional maintenance facility began
without Federal funding or an increase in local taxes in October of 1992.
Safety Certification and Construction of the light rail system was completed by the end of
September, 1994 and the system opened for revenue service with eleven light rail vehicles on
October 7, 1994.

I 5.1.1 Scope and Service
Regular service of the light rail system is regulated by timetables and varies between peak (AM
and PM commuter times) and off-peak hours, weekends and weekdays, and special events, such
as conventions, sports, and parades. Light rail transit carries over 80,000 riders daily. Trains
operate as one, two, three, or four-car consists. Revenue service is generally available 21 hours
per day.
The Regional Transportation District’s objective is to operate the Light Rail Transit System
safely, reliably and efficiently and to integrate the light rail’s operation with bus service for the
greatest convenience to the public. This is the means by which the integration of transportation
services could assist the region in meeting clean air standards, alleviating traffic congestion, and
improving the overall quality of life of the area.
Light rail service operates on the existing 5.3 mile Central Corridor, the 8.7 mile Southwest
Corridor the 1.8 mile Central Platte Valley Spur, the 19 mile Southeast Corridor, and the 12.1
mile West Rail Line, the 10.5 mile I-225 corridor, and the 1.6 mile Southeast Rail Extension
(SERE). The system accommodates six lines; C, D, E, F, H, L, W and R.

I 5.1.2 Organizational Structure
The Light Rail Transit safety specialist’s office is located at the Elati Light Rail Operations and
Maintenance center. Thus, the lines of communication between Safety and Light Rail Operations
are effective. Key positions with Light Rail Operations are the Assistant General Manager of Rail

Operations, Senior Manager, Rail Operations, Planning &Systems, Business Program Manager,
General Superintendent of Light Rail Transportation, Manager of Rail Service Delivery, Manager
LRV Operator Training, Manager of LRT Operations, General Superintendent of Infrastructure.,
Manager of Light Rail Maintenance of Way, General Superintendent of Light Rail Vehicle
Maintenance, and Manager of Light Rail Vehicle Maintenance. All of these key positions have
access to the Light Rail Transit safety specialist.

I 5.1.3 Light Rail Corridors
Central Corridor
Central Corridor transit service is supported by a maintenance facility, light rail vehicles, 13
passenger stations, administrative offices, warehousing, traction power substations, and exclusive
and public rights-of-way through service areas. The light rail Mariposa maintenance facility is
located in Denver at 655 Mariposa Street near 6th Avenue. Light rail operates at speeds up to 55
mph along an exclusive right-of-way section adjacent to freight rail from the south, through the
central or downtown section at reduced speed, and continues at reduced speed through a
business/residential area to the north. The Central Corridor operates on 5.3 miles of trackway
with 13 stations including 3 park-n-ride locations. Light rail operates at surface level except for
one fly-over structure near Kalamath. There are two gated controlled high speed grade crossings
along the Central Corridor alignment, one at 13th Avenue and one at Bayaud.
The Central Corridor extends from I-25 and Broadway on the southwest end to 30th Avenue and
Downing Street on the north. Operations through downtown Denver is a contra-flow relative to
normal traffic, with trains heading northeasterly on California and southwesterly on Stout. The
Central Corridor provides direct connections between the I-25 and Broadway Station transfer
facility, Broadway Marketplace, Auraria Campus, Colorado Convention Center, and the 16th
Street Mall (Market Street, Civic Center Transit Stations, and Union Station, Five Points, and
many major hotels and businesses in between).
Major attractions within a short walking distance of the Central Corridor stations or the 16th
Street Mall shuttles include the Denver Center for the Performing Arts Complex, Federal
Courthouse, 17th Street Financial District, U.S. Mint, Tabor Center, State Capitol, Denver Art
Museum, Denver Public Library, Colorado History Museum, Larimer Square, and Coors Field.
Exhibit I shows the alignment of the Central Corridor and the locations of the thirteen passenger
stations which it serves.
The majority of the Central Corridor alignment is double tracked and parallels I-25 to the east on
an existing railroad right-of-way purchased by RTD from the D&RGW Railroad. The southern
terminus is at the I-25/Broadway Transfer Station where the alignment proceeds adjacent to the
Old Burnham Yard and proceeds down to the Colfax viaduct and Auraria campus. From the
Auraria campus on through the Central Business District area and out to the northern terminus,
the trackway is adjacent to the Denver public streets. The I- 25/Broadway southern terminus
station serves as a major bus transfer facility for Express, Regional and local buses previously
destined to the Denver Central Business District.
Approximately ½ mile north from the south end of the alignment and I-25/Broadway, another bus
transfer facility and passenger station is located at the Broadway Marketplace at Alameda.
Further north, the alignment is grade separated from Santa Fe and Kalamath by an elevated
structure. There are two high-speed grade crossings, one at Bayaud and one at 13th Avenue. Each

1.C.4.a

Continuing north, the Colfax at Auraria passenger station near the Auraria Campus allows direct
access to the campus via a plaza as well as a bus transfer point. After leaving the Colfax at
Auraria station, the double track alignment proceeds across Kalamath and Speer Boulevard,
across a structure over Cherry Creek along Stout to the Convention Center Station near 14th
Street and Stout. At 14th Street, the inbound track turns east and then north to travel along
California. The outbound track continues on Stout Street between 14th and 19th Streets. There are
two passenger stations located on Stout at 16th and 18th Streets. The inbound track along
California travels in an automobile traffic contra-flow direction across 15th Street to the 16th
Street and California passenger station located on the bus mall. Continuing on the single northeast
bound track the alignment then crosses 17th Street to the next passenger station at 18th
Street on California. The single track proceeds northerly along California and southerly along
Stout and lying between 14th and 19th Streets and is referred to as the Crossmall. The Crossmall
is a loop formed by the single-track along the streets of California, 19th, Stout, and 14th, and
provides contra-flow in normally counterclockwise movements.
The alignment turns southeast on 19th where it joins the track to Welton and where the double
track now travels east on Welton Street to the 20th Street passenger station located between 19th
and 20th on Welton. The double track alignment continues as it crosses over to the south side of
Welton near 20th Street to 24th Street. Between 24th and 25th the double track configuration
transitions into a single track configuration. The single-track alignment is retained as it continues
northeasterly on Welton and next proceeds to the 25th Street passenger station located at the
nearside of 26th Street. Still traveling northeasterly along the alignment, the LRV approaches the
27th Street mini station located between 27th and 28th Streets, the alignment then transitions into
a double track configuration as it enters the 30th Avenue/Downing northern terminus station.
Station platforms are unattended and utilize Automated Fare Equipment for ticket sales and ticket
validation. Fare Inspectors monitor the proof of payment honor system. Roving Rail Supervisors,
contracted security specialists, and local police departments provide platform security.
An initial fleet of eleven light rail vehicles (LRVs) was procured for the operation of the Central
Corridor. Shortly after opening for service, six additional LRVs were ordered. The LRVs are a
Siemens Duewag SD100 model. They are 6-axle, single articulated, double ended, bi-directional,
high floor vehicles. They are approximately 80 feet in length, 8 feet and 9 inches in width, 13 feet
high and operate on a standard railroad track gauge of 4 feet and 8 ½ inches. They are powered
from an overhead wire by 750 volts direct current and capable of speeds up to 55 MPH. Each
vehicle is able to seat 48 to 56 passengers and will accommodate up to an additional 61 standing
passengers at normal loads. Additional standees may be accommodated at a crush load capacity.
Exhibit II shows the vehicle layout and critical exterior measurements to maximize the level of
comfort with which the passenger is afforded for their trip. In addition, the LRV is equipped with
HVAC and good lighting configuration.

crossing is protected by a street median, flashing lights, gates and warning bells.. Another
passenger station is located at 10th and Osage. The station is primarily accessed as a pedestrian
and kiss-and ride.

Light rail vehicles are operated manually. Automatic block wayside signals, traffic signals, radio
communication, operational procedures and train orders govern operators regarding all
movements of the vehicles. Appropriate street traffic signals, speed limit signage and wayside
signals assist the operator in selecting proper movement sequence and speeds. City operations are

1.C.4.a

A 2.5 acre yard and Light Rail Mariposa Facility is located adjacent to the Southern Pacific
Railroad switching yard near 6th Avenue at 655 Mariposa Street. Powered switches on the
double track mainline provide access to and from yard leads at either end of the storage yard,
allowing access from ladder tracks into the shop. The Light Rail Mariposa Facility includes a
yard for vehicle storage and a maintenance facility for vehicle maintenance and system support
maintenance. Central Control is located on the second floor of the facility and is the operational
governing authority for all mainline vehicle movement. Central Control personnel
(Controller/Supervisors) direct, control and monitor revenue-service operations using radio,
telephone, and public address communications. Mainline operations is controlled by a schedule
timetable and directed by Central Control in accordance with established operating schedules,
rules and procedures. Controllers implement all corrective actions necessary to maintain service
schedules and to minimize adverse impacts of equipment failures, emergency situations, or
weather related problems. In addition, some unit repair, facility maintenance and non- revenue
maintenance occurs at RTD’s District Shop.
Passenger service on the Central Corridor Light Rail System began October 7, 1994. The system
is operated by Denver’s Regional Transportation District as part of a fully integrated mass transit
system which includes local bus routes, express bus routes, regional bus routes, shuttle bus routes,
and demand-response service for disabled customers.

Southwest Corridor
The Southwest Corridor opened for revenue service in July of 2000. It is an 8.7 mile extension of
the existing light rail system. Integrating into the existing system at I-25 and Broadway in
Denver, the Southwest Corridor extends south to Mineral Avenue in Littleton. There are five light
rail stations at the following locations: Evans Avenue Station; Englewood Station near Hampden
Avenue; Oxford Avenue Station; Littleton Station (downtown Littleton); and Mineral Avenue
Station. Each station location has an associated Park-n-Ride with the exception of the Oxford
Station. Refer to Exhibit I for a diagram of the Southwest Corridor alignment.
The corridor consists of mixed-use operations including three freight railroad mainline tracks,
two light rail tracks, and Santa Fe Drive on the west side of the corridor. The entire corridor is
grade-separated with the exception of a pedestrian-freight spur crossing at the Evans Avenue
Station. Traditional active grade crossing equipment and signals including warning bells, lights,
and gates control this crossing. The light rail tracks parallel the freight mainline tracks throughout
the corridor. To enhance patron use, the light rail corridor resides on the east side of the freight
rail corridor from I-25 and Broadway to Tufts Avenue, and on the west side of the freight corridor
from Tufts Avenue to Mineral Avenue. Two flyover structures accommodate grade separation
between freight railroad and light rail tracks; one near Tufts Avenue where the east/west
transition occurs, and one near Iowa where the light rail tracks cross the Iowa freight spur track.

by line of sight. All city street crossing are governed by coordinating adjacent street intersection
traffic signals while the at-grade crossings at 13th Avenue and at Bayaud are governed by a gate
crossing with flashers and warning bells. The crossing at 13th Avenue and at Bayaud are jointly
used and maintained by the Union Pacific Railroad and RTD.

The Southwest Corridor is a double track alignment operating in high-speed territory at a
maximum speed of 55mph. An additional fourteen light rail vehicles were added to the existing
fleet to accommodate the extension. The light rail vehicles are Siemens Duewag SD100 models,

Central Platte Valley Spur
The Central Platte Valley (CPV) Spur is approximately 1.8 miles in length, linking the existing
Central Corridor light rail line at Colfax Avenue to the Denver Union Station. This is a doubletrack alignment along the entire corridor including the junction.
The CPV Spur begins at approximately Colfax Avenue and Rio Court (at the location where the
existing Central Corridor light rail lines curves to the east under the Colfax Avenue viaduct). The
alignment generally follows Curtis Street from Colfax Avenue to west of 5th Street, on the
western edge of the Auraria Campus. At this point, the alignment turns north and parallels 5th
Street to Walnut Street. The alignment crosses Walnut and enters Auraria West Station. The
alignment parallels the Consolidated Mainline, to the Pepsi Center Station, then continues North
and ends at the Denver Union Station. Stations are located at the new Administration Building of
the Auraria Campus (Auraria West); near the existing "Sports Walk" that serves Empower Field
at Mile High Station near the Stadium; at the pedestrian bridge serving the Pepsi Center and
Elitch Gardens; and the Denver Union Station.
The alignment has two at-grade crossings:, 5th Street and Walnut Street.. The alignment includes
control and safety considerations to mitigate impacts to traffic in these areas. Specifically, these
include active warning devices at the light rail crossing of 5th Street and Walnut Street.
During major events, such as games and concerts at the Pepsi Center, Coors Field and Empower
Field at Mile High Stadium special service will be provided with trains running as frequently as
every four to five minutes between the event venue and the Southwest and Southeast Corridors.
Some of these special events trains may terminate at the I- 25/Broadway station while other will
continue to the Mineral Avenue, and Ridgegate end-of-line stations.

Southeast Corridor
The Southeast Corridor began revenue service in November 2006. The Southeast Corridor
consists of 34.47 kilometers (21.42 miles) of double-tracked light rail transit, beginning at the
existing Broadway station and ending at Ridgegate Station. This includes an alignment along I225 in the median, from I-25 to Parker Road. There are 16 stations: Louisiana; University;
Colorado; Yale; Southmoor; Belleview; Orchard; Arapahoe; Dry Creek; County Line; Lincoln;
Skyridge; Lone Tree Transit Center; Ridgegate Parkway; Dayton; and Nine Mile: . All facilities,
including RTD trains, stations, pedestrian and bicycle facilities, and other design elements, are in
full compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

the same vehicle in use for the Central Corridor. The light rail Mariposa maintenance facility was
expanded to accommodate the fleet size increase. All operational characteristics for the
Southwest Corridor are similar to the existing operational characteristics of the Central Corridor.
Since service origination of the Southwest Corridor, eighteen additional SD 100s have been
placed into revenue service.

In May 2019 the Southeast Rail Extension (SERE) was opened for revenue service. This
extended double track rail service from the old Lincoln End of Line 1.6 miles to the new end of
line Ridgegate Station. Two other stations, Skyridge and Lone Tree City Center are located on
the extension.

The Southeast Corridor LRT alignment begins with a wye connection south of the existing
Broadway Rail Station. This connection allows LRT vehicles from the Southeast Corridor to
access both the Southwest Corridor and existing LRT line to central downtown. Following the
wye tracks, the LRT alignment rises above grade to pass over Broadway on an aerial structure.
After crossing Broadway, the alignment turns to the south along the southbound I-25 on ramp and
drops down to match the grade of I-25. This allows the LRT alignment to pass under the cross
streets maintaining a 5.1-meter (17-foot) vertical clearance above the top of rail. Through the
Narrows (Broadway to University) the LRT alignment parallels I-25 between I-25's collector
distributor road and Buchtel Boulevard. The tracks generally pass behind the abutment of the
highway bridges through a separate LRT bridge structure.
At the University interchange, the LRT alignment moves away from I-25 and runs along the
outside edge of the University off-ramp and rises up to pass over University on the aerial
structure. After crossing University, the LRT alignment continues along the outside edge of the
University on-ramp, returning to an alignment adjacent to the I-25 shoulder and at the same grade
as the highway.
Colorado to Evans
At Colorado, the LRT alignment follows the Colorado Boulevard off-ramp and travels under
Colorado Boulevard in a short tunnel section. After passing under Colorado, the LRT alignment
remains below grade, in an open trench section, and again parallels I-25, remaining as it passes
under Evans in a tunnel section.
Evans to Union
After passing under Evans, the LRT alignment rises up to return to the highway grade running
adjacent to the highway to Yale. At Yale Avenue, the LRT alignment runs along the edge of the
Yale ramps and passes over Yale on an aerial structure.
South of Yale, the LRT alignment follows along the west side of I-25, to Hampden Avenue. At
Hampden, the LRT alignment enters a very short tunnel section under Hampden and then returns
to the I-25 grade on the south side of Hampden.
The alignment passes under Quincy and then travels along the western edge of the I-25/I- 225
freeway interchange. Special track-work at this location allows for a wye connection to the LRT
alignment located along I-225. These connecting tracks are primarily at- grade and pass below the
I-25/I-225 interchange.

the LRT alignment rises up to pass over the three west side ramps and Arapahoe Road on a long
aerial structure.

South of Arapahoe Road, the LRT alignment continues south, adjacent to the I-25 shoulder to
Dry Creek. At Dry Creek, the LRT alignment travels adjacent to the ramps and over Dry Creek
on an aerial structure. After passing Dry Creek, the LRT alignment returns to the I-25 shoulder to
County Line Road where it rises up to pass over two ramps and County Line Road on an aerial
structure. After passing County Line Road and the ramp in the southwest quadrant of the
interchange, the LRT alignment runs along the west edge of I-25 to the C-470/E470 interchange.
Through the C-470/E470 interchange, the LRT travels under the ramps in short tunnels and over
C470, around the western side of the interchange ramps and then adjacent to I- 25, where it
continues south to Skyridge station then crosses over to the east side of I-25 to Lone Tree City
Center and then south where it continues to an end of line station at Ridgegate Parkway.
I-225 from I-25 to Parker Road
The LRT alignment along I-225 begins at the I-25/I-225 interchange, where it connects to the I25 alignment through a wye connection, allowing LRT vehicles to connect to both the
northbound and southbound lines on the I-25 LRT alignment. After the wye connection, the LRT
alignment travels in the I-225 median at the highway grade. The LRT alignment continues in the
I-225 median to Parker Road where it passes over Parker and terminates with tail tracks on the
north side of Parker.
The Corridor operates with similar characteristics as existing corridors including traction power
substations and signal systems. A SCADA system is included in the Southeast Corridor project
and is retrofitted into the existing system. Additionally, an automatic trip stop system was added
to stop trains if they bypass a red signal.

West Corridor
The West Rail Line is a 12.1-mile light rail transit corridor that began revenue service in April
2013 extending from Denver Union Station (DUS) to Jefferson County, through Denver,
Lakewood and Golden. The West Rail Line has twelve stations including Auraria West,
Decatur/Federal, Knox, Perry, Sheridan, Lamar, Wadsworth, Garrison, Oak, Federal Center, Red
Rocks Community College, and Jeffco Government Center.
The alignment is double track from DUS to the Federal Center and is single track from the
Federal Center to the Jeffco Government Center station. Total travel time from DUS
to Jefferson County Government Center-Golden is 35 minutes. The corridor operates similarly to
existing RTD light rail corridors.

I-225 Rail Corridor
The I-225 project added 10.5-miles to the Light Rail System within the city of Aurora that
provides key regional connections to the East and southeast rail lines. It was part of Fastracks,
RTD’s voter-approved plan passed in November 2004 to expand transit service across the Denver
metro region. Construction on the full line began in 2013. This light rail line opened for service to
the public featuring eight stations, Florida, Iliff, Aurora Metro Center, 2nd and Abilene, 13th
Avenue, Colfax, Fitzsimmons, and Peoria; as the R line in February 2017. This corridor extends
Light Rail service North from Nine Mile Station to the Peoria station where customers can
connect to the Commuter Line to Denver International Airport.

I 5.1.4 Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)

40
Packet Pg. 105

The RTD Light Rail System includes a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)
system. The SCADA system provides two types of general functions: control over certain system
elements from the Central Control center; and system monitoring and status information to the
Central Control Center. The SCADA system allows light rail controllers certain capabilities such
as remote capability to power down sections of the alignment and control over power switches. It
also provides information to the light rail controllers on the status of certain elements of the light
rail system. SCADA information includes: train locations, switch alignments, power status, signal
status and a variety of additional system information.

I 5.1.5 Light Rail Vehicles
The RTD light rail vehicle fleet consists of two models from Siemens: the SD 100 and the SD
160. The vehicles are very similar and have two main differences. The SD 160 has an AC
propulsion system and sliding plug doors where the SD 100 has a DC propulsion system and bifold doors. The SD 100 model is the original RTD vehicle and there are 49 vehicles in the fleet.
The SD 160 was originally ordered for the Southeast Corridor extension: 68 were delivered with
an additional 55 vehicles ordered for FasTracks, the first of which arrived in August 2009. An
additional 29 SD 160 vehicles were ordered in July 2018.RTD now has a total fleet of 201
vehicles..

I 5.1.6 Operations
Central Control, which underwent a major remodel to accommodate the system expansion and
SCADA, governs the operation, control, and dispatch of light rail vehicles. Control maintains
contact with the train operators by means of radio located in each light rail vehicle cab. Light rail
operators also carry a portable radio to be used in case they have to leave the cab or radio failure.
Controller/Supervisors rove throughout the system during operations. Their role is to provide
support and coordination between Central Control and light rail vehicle operators during an
emergency or upset in the system that may require a manual block operation, bus bridge,
evacuation, or accident response and investigation.
Current operations consist of eight lines; C, D, E, F, H, L, W and R. The C line serves from
Mineral Avenue to Denver Union Station. The D line serves from Mineral Avenue to 18th and
California. The E line serves from Ridgegate to Denver Union Station. The F line serves from
Ridgegate to 18th and California. The H line serves from Florida to 18th and California. The L
line is a downtown loop between 16th and Stout and 30th and Downing. The W line serves from
Jeffco Government Center to Denver Union Station. The R Line which opened February 2017
serves from Ridgegate to Peoria Station. Typical headways vary from 5 to 15 minutes during
peak operations with increased service operated for certain special events. Early morning or late
night headways on weekends and holidays are typically 30 minutes.
In the case of an accident or breakdown of the system, the controller controls train movement
using a manual block system. When necessary, buses are used in a “bridging” procedure to move
passengers around a trouble area.

In 2020, an additional commuter rail line, the North Metro (N-Line) will be starting revenue
service. Regional Transportation District (RTD) employees will perform all operations and
maintenance on the N-Line.
Denver Union Station (DUS) is the hub for multiple transportation modes in the Denver metro
area. Services operating on the East Corridor, Northwest Electrified Segment (NWES), and the
Gold Line terminate at DUS, which also accommodates Amtrak and other heavy rail movements.
The North Metro (N Line) operated by RTD will also operate out of DUS hub. DTO is
responsible for dispatching all commuter rail trains in and out of DUS and for maintaining the
infrastructure within the station.
The East Corridor (A Line) is a 22.8-mile segment running from Denver Union station (DUS) to
Denver International Airport (DEN). This line has six intermediate stations. The Northwest
Electrified Segment (B Line) is 5.5 miles operating north from DUS to Westminster. Two
stations are located on a portion of the Gold and B Lines share a portion of the track. The Gold
Line (G Line) is an 11.2-mile line that runs from DUS, west to Wheat Ridge. This line has six
intermediate stations.
The Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility (CRMF) is the central control center for Denver Transit
Operators (DTO). This facility has a rolling stock maintenance shop, warehouse, administrative
offices and storage yard including a car wash.
The North Metro (N Line) is currently under testing and has six stations. Four of these stations
have pedestrian crossings. This 13.8-mile corridor will include 6 Highway Grade Crossings and
11 bridges.
Commuter Rail is regulated by the Federal Railroad Administration, and is subject to FRA rules,
regulations, and inspections. Hours of operation are, generally, 3:00 a.m.–1:30 a.m.

I 5.3

BUS OPERATIONS SYSTEM DESCRIPTION

The Regional Transportation District was created by an act of the Colorado General Assembly in
1969 and became an operating unit on July 1 of that year. The purpose of creating this agency
was to provide a regional approach to public transportation.
On January 1, 1974, RTD began collecting the half percent sales tax and became fully
operational. RTD initially inherited 321 buses from Denver Metro Transit.
Many of these vehicles were over 20 years old. Total bus mileage was nine million miles per
year, with fewer than 20 million riders annually.

Attachment: 2020 RTD TASP -Final - pdf 11-1-19 (3993 : 2020 Public Transit Agency Safety Plan)

1.C.4.a

Only one maintenance and storage facility existed for buses. There was little or no maintenance
capacity for buses in the small system operating in the District. These systems served several
local areas and there was a private Denver-Boulder bus line.

42
Packet Pg. 107

1.C.4.a

The improved service included the extension of routes, new local and express routes; more
frequent service; new nighttime service on many routes; increased service to the mountain areas
of the District; exclusive bus lanes and the inauguration of special service for the elderly and
disabled. Meeting special needs made RTD the first transit system in the nation with a
comprehensive bus program to service the needs of the elderly and disabled. All of these factors
led to a significant increase in ridership.
To support and encourage new riders, RTD also launched a program to establish Park-n- Ride
facilities. Additional bus maintenance and storage facilities were acquired to accommodate the
growing bus fleet.
The Mall bus service became operational in 1982. This was the first step in a unique transit
concept, which would pull 50 percent of the buses off downtown streets during peak hours and
provide opportunities for additional suburban service.
The District has evolved into a transit system that has a service area of 2,348 square miles. It
serves 40 municipalities in 8 counties. The system is comprised of 148 routes. The fleet currently
has 1011 buses of which 434 are leased to private carriers. There are currently four maintenance
and storage facilities District wide, 77 Park-n-Rides and 6 transfer stations.

I 5.3.1 Scope and Service
Regular service of the bus transit system is regulated by timetables and varies between peak and
off-peak hours, weekends, weekdays, and special events. The bus system transports an average of
344,339 weekday boarding’s. Denver Union Street Station and Civic Center Station are the main
transfer stations in the downtown Denver area.

I 5.3.2 Organizational Structure
The Bus Transit safety specialist’s office is located at the 1660 Blake Street office. Key positions
with Bus Operations are the Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, Deputy Assistant
General Manager of Bus Operations, General Superintendent of Bus Transportation, Manager of
Bus Transportation, General Superintendent of Bus Maintenance, Manager of Bus Maintenance,
and Manager of Street Supervision. All of these key positions have daily contact with the Bus
Transit safety specialist.

Attachment: 2020 RTD TASP -Final - pdf 11-1-19 (3993 : 2020 Public Transit Agency Safety Plan)

RTD began building a modern bus fleet and its needed support facilities. In 1975, the six
fragmented bus systems that had provided service to different areas of the District were integrated
into a single, unified system. New and improved service became the focal points for future
growth.

I 5.3.3 Bus Transportation Operations
Dispatch governs the operation, control and dispatch of buses and other RTD vehicles. Dispatch
maintains control with bus operators by means of two-way radios, standard telephones, and the
Global Positioning System. Street Supervisors also carry portable radios in the event of a system
failure. Street supervisors rove throughout the system during operations. Their role is to provide
43
Packet Pg. 108

1.C.4.a

Transportation Operations is responsible for providing safe, reliable and efficient service to all
areas served by our mass transit system. This is accomplished by scheduling bus service from
three divisions with 910 full-time and 133 part time bus operators. Service is provided seven days
a week over approximately 21 hours of each day.
Street Supervisors monitor service and performance of bus operators to insure the safe, efficient,
on-time delivery of scheduled bus service. The District also provides continuous evaluation of
routes, schedules, bus stops, shelters and facilities to determine the effectiveness and condition of
the service and amenities.
Effective, two-way radio communication is provided to all revenue and non-revenue vehicles.
Information is received and relayed to the proper sources to provide assistance and coordination
for bus operations. Communication is provided through the radio system, telephones, and a stateof the art tracking system.
The District also monitors bus service provided by private contractors, who operate
approximately 50% of RTD’s fixed route service. Assistance is provided to customers at transit
centers, transfer stations and the Telephone Information Center. The District also coordinates
special community events planning. In the event of a transit emergency, Dispatchers and Street
Supervisors will coordinate bus activities.

I 5.3.4 Standard Operating Procedures and Employee Rule Book
Bus Operations are strictly governed by policies and procedures outlined in the “Trailblazer”.
Standard rules of conduct and procedure are necessary. The rules outlined in this document have
been adopted for the requirements of RTD’s operations and are considered necessary for
rendering a quality level of service to customers. The “Trailblazer” is comprehensive manual with
procedures and guidelines for every aspect of bus operations including: the performance code;
passenger relations and interaction; ADA requirements; personnel practices; operating
procedures; emergency and legal procedures; equipment care and operation; personal appearance;
radio procedures; fares, transfers, and passes; operation procedures; routes maps and diagrams;
maintenance tips; fleet data; and street guides.
Service Planning/Scheduling updates the “Trailblazer” on an as-needed basis. Transportation
bulletins are a common practice that addresses day to day issues.

Management
I 6.1

System Security Plan (SSP)

The security program for RTD is described in the System Security Plan (SSP) filed with the
Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Transportation Security Administration (TSA). The
SSP is considered sensitive security information (SSI) per 49 CFR 15 and 1520, with distribution
controlled to only those with a need-to-know. The SSP complies with DHS guidance including
the National Response Framework, National Incident Management System (NIMS), and National
Preparedness Goal. For response to terrorism or natural disaster incidents, RTD Emergency
Management Plan is based on partnerships with the Urban Area Security Initiative working
group, and first-responder organizations of cities and counties throughout RTD's service area.
For traditional security functions as well as terrorism prevention, RTD's plans are based upon a
formally-adopted policy of awareness, observation and reporting by all employees, especially
front-line personnel, combined with effective responses by both RTD Security Operations
Command and first-responder law enforcement and emergency management organizations. RTD
riders are also asked to report suspicious behaviors or packages to employees, the RTD Security
Command Center, via the RTD Transit Watch App for mobile phones, or call 9-1-1 in the event
of an incident. RTD's Transit Police Division works in partnership with Police and Sheriff’s
departments throughout RTD's service area for high responsiveness to calls for police assistance
on the transit system, for application of the RTD Code of Conduct throughout the RTD service
area, and for effective criminal investigations and prosecutions. In support of security awareness
and reporting by transit system employees, RTD design criteria for new service projects applies
Crime Prevention through Environmental Design (CPTED) principles, and provides Closed
Circuit Television and other equipment throughout the system to enhance security.

A more extensive discussion of RTD emergency management activities is contained in the RTD
Emergency Preparedness Plans, and the Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP), which are being
developed/revised for RTD. Each mode within RTD has the requirement to develop their specific
emergency response plan. Light Rail Emergency Response Plan, Commuter Rail Emergency
response Plan and Bus Emergency Preparedness Plan. These plans detail activities and
responsibilities for Rail Service personnel and are the responsibility of the Safety Department.
This plan (along with the safety program documents and SSP) also describes coordination of the
following emergency preparedness/management activities:
 Incident management – RTD management of an emergency event or incident is based on
the principles of NIMS and the Incident Command System (ICS). Using National
Incident Management System (NIMS) principles allows emergency response agencies to
communicate with RTD Field Supervisors and/or the RTD Security Command Center
(SCC). The structure of the ICS can be as simple as a single RTD Field Supervisor
responding to an incident, or may require the activation of a field Incident Command Post
or the RTD Emergency Operations Center (EOC).
 Coordination with external agencies – the RTD Chief of Police and Emergency
Management is principally responsible for the coordination of incident management
resources with various emergency service agencies to provide for effective interaction
between RTD and those agencies. Liaison with law enforcement agencies is primarily
the responsibility of the Chief Safety Officer, with assistance from the Chief of Police
and Emergency Management
 Emergency response planning and mitigation – RTD establishes a Fire/Life Safety and
Security Committee for each new rail extension or significant transit facility project. The
committee is comprised of safety and security staff; RTD operations, maintenance, and
engineering representatives; and police, fire, emergency medical, and other area
emergency response agency representatives. The committee reviews transit system
designs and recommends fire protection, life safety and security measures, and
procedural response and training needs related to the new extension or facility project.
 Emergency planning – As a critical transportation provider in the Denver metropolitan
area, RTD is a member of the Regional Emergency Management COOP and Urban Area
Security Initiative (UASI). It is RTD’s intent to develop a task force with regional
Emergency Management agencies responsible for emergency preparedness, response,
recovery, and mitigation planning and coordination among the counties and cities in the
metropolitan area, emergency response agencies, RTD, utility companies, and other
critical groups. RTD, with assistance from the Fire/Life Safety and Security Committee,
has developed emergency management operating plans and procedures to address a wide
range of emergency incidents and events, including criminal activity, earthquakes, fire at
transit stations and along the rights-of-way, hazardous materials releases, medical
emergencies, severe weather, terrorism, transportation mishaps, and other emergency
situations occurring within the RTD transit system.
 Emergency preparedness exercises – a minimum of one emergency tabletop or field
exercise is planned and conducted annually to ensure the adequacy of emergency plans
and procedures; readiness of RTD personnel to perform under emergency conditions;
effective coordination between RTD and emergency response agencies; and coordination
of regional emergency exercises that are facilitated through Use of the TERA Software or
other means. All exercises are followed by after-action analyses and reports to document
lessons learned and actions needed to improve RTD’s emergency operations capabilities.

Emergency response training – All front line RTD transportation and maintenance
personnel will undergo emergency response training to ensure they have a full
understanding of their role and responsibility during an emergency incident. The level of
training will be based on their anticipated role during the incident. At a minimum,
training is provided on the emergency plans and procedures that the employee may be
required to implement. Training to familiarize fire, rescue, and other emergency service
personnel with special transit system requirements is coordinated through the Fire and
Life Safety Committees and Safety and Security staff with assistance from the
Transportation and Maintenance Departments, as appropriate.

I 7 Hazard/Risk Management Overview
The hazard management program is developed and implemented by the Safety and
Environmental Division. Under the direction of the RTD Chief Safety and Security Officer,
Assistant General Manager of Safety, Security and Asset Management, the Senior Manager of
Safety and Environmental is responsible for managing this program. RTD utilizes the American
Passenger Transportation Association (APTA) guidelines and Military Standard 882E regarding
the identification and classification of hazards based on severity and probability. The hazard risk
index matrix is used to determine the overall hazard risk index. Hazard identification and
notification is accomplished in a variety of ways. Any employee may report potential hazards to
the Safety and Environmental Division by: use of the RTD safety issue/hazard reporting systems
that include Safety Committees, Safety Concern Reporting (HUB), Safety Hotline, Safety
@RTD-Denver.com, and Safety Suggestion boxes, or by contacting any of the Safety Division
staff or their immediate supervisor. Many hazards are reported and managed through the safety
committee process. Hazards will also be reported through formal mechanisms such as facility and
equipment inspections, internal safety reviews, system modification proposals, design review,
safety open items lists, integrated testing, and safety and security certification. This is an
integrated, system-wide approach to hazard management.
Once identified and reported, the Safety and Environmental Division will conduct a formal
hazard/risk analysis. All identified hazards will be tracked by the Safety and Environmental
Division and documented in the RTD Hazard/Event system or risk register. Regarding hazard
control and elimination, the system safety or hazard reduction precedence will be applied: design
for minimum risk (eliminate hazard through design when feasible/practical); incorporate safety
devices; provide warning devices; and develop policies, procedures and training.
The State Safety Oversight rules require that transit agencies with fixed rail guideways develop
and implement a hazard management program. The requirements include that the program
identify minimum thresholds, using RTD system data for the notification and reporting of hazards
to the oversight agency. For RTD’s program, hazards defined as meeting the minimum threshold
as reportable to the Public Utilities Commission (which utilizing Mil. Stan. 882E will be hazards
of hazard risk assessment matrix “High/unacceptable” – 1A, 1B, 1C, 2A, 2B, and 3A) will be
reported to the PUC as soon as practicable, but not later than 24 hours from the time of
occurrence or discovery. Hazard investigation reports will be provided to the PUC within 45 days
of the initial report date and include all PUC required information including a corrective action
plan and schedule for implementation. RTD will provide the PUC with quarterly progress reports
for hazards defined as reportable to the PUC. Refer to section 3.3.2 for additional information on
hazard management program. Hazards that do not fall into the “High/Unacceptable” category

will be reported to the PUC in monthly reports and will have all corrective action plans created
and implemented by RTD staff as outlined in the Safety Risk Management and Safety Assurance
sections of the PTASP.

I8

Safety Assurance Overview

Safety Assurance is accomplished through implementation of safety oversight and risk
monitoring activities. As RTD implements its SMS, several activities will be initiated and tools
will be developed to support these safety oversight and risk monitoring activities. Safety
assurance includes safety reviews, evaluations, reviews, and inspections, as well as safety data
collection, tracking, and analysis, from various sources, including investigations; and
development of Key Safety Performance Indicators and Targets.
Safety Assurance also requires RTD to describe safety performance measures, and RTD will
initially focus on areas based on existing data delivered to the National Transit Database (NTD),
as the following:
 Fatalities – total number of reportable fatalities and rate per total vehicle revenue miles
by mode
 Injuries – total number of reportable injuries and rate per total vehicle revenue miles by
mode
 Safety Events – total number of reportable events and rate per total vehicle revenue miles
by mode
 System Reliability – mean distance between major mechanical failures by mode
These safety performance measures are used to select improvement targets for these four
measures and each mode of transit, in order to encourage improvements and monitor safety
performance of delivering transit services. In addition, RTD will select additional performance
measures, both leading and lagging, to insure continual improvement of our Safety Management
System.

I 8.1

Management of Change

Change Management is critical to an effective Safety Assurance program. The primary purpose of
change management, system modification, and safety and security certification is to ensure that
changes to the baseline/existing or significant capital projects for the transit system are reviewed
for conformance with existing RTD standards and to identify and assess potential hazards before
making changes to documents, equipment, facilities, or transit routes. Safety critical operational
documents, bus and rail fixed facilities, revenue and non-revenue vehicles equipment, and transit
routes are subject to change management and formal document control procedures. They include,
but are not limited to, agency policies standard operating procedures, emergency operating
procedures, safety and operating rules, training materials, drawings, and engineering reference
information.

Attachment: 2020 RTD TASP -Final - pdf 11-1-19 (3993 : 2020 Public Transit Agency Safety Plan)

Hazard management for the existing and future commuter rail system is described in Commuter
Rail System Safety Program Plan.

These documents are subject to review or revision as a result of (not exclusive):
 Incidents or mishaps

Policy changes

In 2019, RTD created the Infrastructure Change Review Committee. The management of change
will be managed by the Infrastructure Change Review process. Details of this change
management process and the safety and security certification process can be found in the Safety
Assurance Section of the PTASP. In addition, the RTD Transit Asset Management (TAM) Plan
and State of Good Repair efforts are managed separately, but are inputs to the SMS processes.

I 8.2

Continuous Improvement

Continuous improvement is defined by FTA as a process by which a transit agency examines
safety performance to identify safety deficiencies and carry out a plan to address the identified
safety deficiencies. RTD will use the management review cycle along with performance data for
the Safety Management System to identify and prioritize continuous improvement of each
process. This method is consistent with safety management systems principles and allows for the
resourcing and prioritization of RTD’s SMS efforts.

I9

Safety Promotion Overview

Safety promotion includes safety culture, safety-related lessons learned, and reporting systems,
recommendations based on safety metrics, data, and safety training. The intent of safety
promotion is to foster a positive safety culture in which RTD employees receive ongoing training
and updates of safety progress; feel comfortable reporting safety issues or concerns; and
understand why safety is important and how staff actions or inactions impact safety. Through
safety promotion, the Leadership Team broadcasts its commitment to safety and the SMS, and
demonstrates its commitment to the importance of safety.
The RTD Safety Promotion plans focus on three main areas:
1. Safety Culture - A positive safety culture focuses on finding and correcting systemic
issues rather than finding someone or something to blame. A positive safety culture
flourishes in an environment of trust, encouraging error-reporting and discouraging
covering up mistakes. The need to address behavior that is malicious or recklessly
negligent must be balanced with the need for a just culture that is not excessively
punitive. A positive safety culture goes beyond simply adhering to procedures. It is
demonstrated when employees carry out their duties correctly, with attention to detail,
full knowledge, sound judgment, and a sense of accountability.

Attachment: 2020 RTD TASP -Final - pdf 11-1-19 (3993 : 2020 Public Transit Agency Safety Plan)

1.C.4.a

2. Safety Communication - Effective communication of safety risks is critical and a key
component of the safety culture.

53
Packet Pg. 118

A Safety Promotion Communication Plan will be created with the assistance of the RTD
Communication Department. The Safety Promotion Communication Plan will include at least the
following topics:
 Dissemination of safety messages, progress towards safety performance targets, and
lessons learned
 Safety Hazards and risks
 Inform employees of actions taken in response to Safety Concern Reporting and trends
 Measuring or assessing safety culture
 Safety culture promotion
Safety Communication also includes the riders of the transit systems and the public that interacts
with the transit system. RTD leads and participates in several safety outreach activities and
provides safety awareness messages for riders and the public. The RTD Senior Specialist, Safety
Communications works directly with the SS&AM department to ensure a consistent internal and
external safety messaging.
3. Safety Training - Appropriate safety training is provided for each employee
commensurate with their position.
All RTD personnel will receive training to become familiar with:
 Safety Management Systems Overview
 Safety Reporting /Risk Management
 Safety Assurance
 Employee Roles and Responsibilities

I 9.1

Specific Job Safety Training

Safety specific training is provided by the division and department for employees. The training
includes an understanding of safety risks and controls, rules, and procedures. It is the
responsibility of department managers and supervisors to ensure the training requirements are
identified and fulfilled. SS&AM coordinates with department training instructors in formulating
and refining the training programs.
Managers and supervisors must arrange appropriate safety training for each position. This
includes both technical and non-technical training, on-the-job training, and refresher training.
Trainers must be competent and qualified in the delivery of training. A complete and
comprehensive training and qualification record by employee is maintained.
Suitable qualifications of employees are maintained and revalidated in accordance with the
requirements of the division and department, and regulatory requirements.

Element II of the Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan is Risk Management, describing how
RTD identifies, evaluates, tracks and mitigates hazards and risk in the organization and on the
transit system. In this element, the processes undertaken by the authority are provided in
sufficient detail to be effectively undertaken. Acceptable risk levels, performance targets and
mitigation measures are established.

Risk Management Program

II 1.1 Hazard Management
The management of identified hazards is a vital component of the RTD Safety Management
System. A hazard is defined as a condition or set of conditions, internal or external to the RTD
system, which when activated could cause injury or death or damage or loss of equipment or
property. An unacceptable hazard is a condition that may endanger human life or property or
result in system loss. This includes harm to passengers, employees, contractors, equipment, and to
the general public. These hazardous conditions must be mitigated. Hazards are identified in
several different internal and external sources. Hazards may be observed in the operating
environment, through procedures, during system modifications and capital projects, accidents,
extensions or operational changes.
RTD has implemented the guidance as outlined in FTA’s Clarification letter September 6, 2007
on the hazard management requirements. The Hazard Management Program applies to all RTD
employees and obligates everyone to constantly observe hazards in their work areas and report
them to their safety committee, the transit safety specialist or to their supervisor or manager. The
overall hazard management program incorporates a system-wide hazard identification process,
including activities for:
 Identification
 Investigation
 Evaluation and analysis
 Control and elimination
 Tracking
 Ongoing reporting to PUC SSO and RTD senior management relating to hazard
management activities and status

II 1.1.2

Local Hazard Management

RTD Department Managers will play a key role in the hazard management process and ensure
that the process has been fully integrated within their departments. Managers will also ensure the
following elements of the hazard management process are present in their departments:
 Ensure employees have the ability to report hazards to management in person or through
the use of the electronic hazard reporting form via the hub;
 Ensure hazards are placed on a local hazard log for tracking and documentation;

Participate in assigning hazard ratings (in accordance with the RTD Risk Assessment
Matrix); and
Ensure employees receive appropriate hazard management training.

II 1.1.3

Local Hazard Logs

Department managers along with transit safety specialists will ensure local hazard logs are used
to track hazards at the departmental level within RTD. These logs are to be maintained within the
department and are reviewed by the local safety committee on a monthly basis. Hazards placed on
the local log receive their initial and final hazard rating using RTD’s 21 box risk assessment
matrix. Management may give hazards their initial rating when hazards are received and final
ratings when they are closed. Management may also present hazards to the local safety committee
for hazard ratings or employ the Safety Department for assistance in rating hazards. Hazard
ratings may be changed when new information or as a result of data analysis.

II 1.1.4

Hazard Management

When a hazard is identified as needing mitigation that requires cost or changes beyond that of the
local safety committee or department abilities, the hazard will be elevated to the corresponding
Safety Department Hazard Logs and be reviewed by the future Safety and Security Review
Committee (SSRC). The SSRC will represent key department managers that have the ability to
make decisions and will employ multiple disciplines at RTD and have access to higher level
budgeted solutions.

II 1.1.5

Safety Department Hazard Logs

Transit safety specialists (TSS) are responsible for the maintenance of Safety Department Hazard
Logs. TSS’s ensure that hazards meeting defined criteria are entered into the appropriate category
within the Hazard Reporting System for accurate record keeping. Hazard rating can be assigned
by the either the TSS or the future SSRC. The following are Specific hazards that are identified
and mitigated at the corporate level:
 Unacceptable hazards (High Hazards);
 Hazards identified from reviews from outside agency’s (PUC, FTA, FRA, OSHA);
 Hazards identified from accident investigations;
 Hazards where corrective action will cost more than an estimate of $25,000;
 Serious or high hazards on local department hazard log over 180 day;
 When warranted by the Safety Department

II 1.1.6

Corrective Action Plan (CAP)

Attachment: 2020 RTD TASP -Final - pdf 11-1-19 (3993 : 2020 Public Transit Agency Safety Plan)



Corrective action plans are utilized within RTD for hazards that meet certain criteria. The
following hazards require the usage of a corrective action plan:
 Unacceptable hazards with a Risk Assessment Code of 1A, 2A, 1B, 2B, or 1C (High
Hazards);
58
Packet Pg. 123

1.C.4.a




Review findings from regulatory agencies resulting in Non-conformance (PUC, FTA,
FRA, OSHA);
Corrective action resulting from accident investigations;
When warranted by the Safety Department

In the following instances corrective action plans must receive prior approval by the SSO
Manager before corrective action plans may be carried out:
 Unacceptable hazards with a Risk Assessment Code of 1A, 2A, 1B, 2B, or 1C (High
Hazards);
 Review findings from regulatory agencies resulting in Non-conformance (PUC, FTA,
FRA, OSHA);
 Accident investigations requiring corrective action,
 Testing or reviews of Industrial Hygiene which potentially exceed OSHA PEL limits,
For hazards that do not meet the Unacceptable Risk Assessment Codes of 1A, 2A, 1B, 2B or 1C
(High Hazards), SSO staff will review and preliminarily approve the CAP before safety risk
mitigation activities are implemented.
If an emergency corrective action must be taken immediately to ensure safety, the SSO must be
notified of the issue immediately and RTD must follow up with the SSO for subsequent review
and approval of the corrective action, within 5 business days.
The SSO will review and provide final approval of all Corrective Action Plans on a quarterly
basis.
CAP’s are assigned a specific tracking numbers by the Electronic Hazard Reporting System and
are and are linked with its associated hazard. CAP’s must contain at a minimum:
 A person of responsibility for the corrective action
 A proposed completion date
 Plan approval when applicable

II 1.1.7

Corrective Action Plan/Preventative Action Plan Development

Corrective action plans are developed by department managers/designee in conjunction with the
Safety Department and associated safety committees (Local Safety Committee, future SSRC, and
ESSC). Accident Evaluation Groups (to be formalized) will also be utilized when developing
CAP’s resulting from hazards identified after an accident. TSS’s will ensure that the CAP process
is followed and properly tracked until it is closed.

II 1.2 Hazard Process Overview
RTD's hazard process includes light rail, commuter rail, and bus systems. The following hazard
management flow chart lays out an overall description of how hazards are identified, evaluated,
analyzed, controlled or eliminated, tracked and reported to RTD senior management and PUC
State Safety Oversight.
 The Transit safety specialists assigned to light rail, bus, and capital projects are the
primary points of contact (POC) for the hazard management process.

Safety Committee members for rail and bus will be able to identify, evaluate, and analyze
hazards.
The TSS’s will enter identified hazards into the electronic hazard reporting system.
The TSS and or committee will develop a Corrective Action Plan (CAP) for each
unacceptable and undesirable hazard entry and identify point of contact or owner of the
hazard and places this information within the hazard reporting system for tracking
purposes.
CAP's may also be identified as a result of an incident and investigation.
Safety committee members also participate in the evaluation and control or elimination of
the hazard.
Hazards must be mitigated at the lowest level possible. However, when a hazard is
identified as having a mitigation that involves multiple departments, or requires cost or
changes beyond the safety committee or department abilities or budgets the hazard will
be elevated to the future Safety and Security Review Committee (SSRC). The SSRC will
represent key department managers and have the capability to employ multiple
disciplines at RTD and have access to higher level budgeted solutions.
Recommendations/Results from Contractor or Internal review, testing, industrial or
environmental sampling results requiring corrective actions will be placed in the hazard
log for follow up and possible need for retesting for compliance with Safety or
Environmental requirements.
If mitigation or control of a hazard is not achieved through the future SSRC, the hazard
mitigation process may be elevated to the Chief Safety Officer’s Safety and Security
Committee (ESSC) for final resolution.

II 1.3 Hazard Identification
Identification of hazards is the responsibility of all RTD employees and contractors. The
continuous identification, monitoring, and elimination of hazards is key to an effective system
safety program.
 Hazard identification methods include, but are not limited to the following:
 Observation, inspection, and interaction of all RTD employees and contractors,
 Reports from safety committee members, passengers, customer service, and field
personnel,
 Evaluation of accidents, incidents, near misses, to include data trends and projections.
 Preliminary Hazard Analysis (PHA) of a design or new construction,
 Safety certification, system integration testing, pre-revenue testing, system modification,
configuration management verification, and inspection processes,
 Operation Hazard Analysis (OHA) of revenue operations
 Internal and external safety reviews, inspections, observations, defects, findings,
observations, violations, and reviews
 Controller logs, daily operating clearances/bulletins, and training feedback
 "Lesson learned" inputs.
 Review of applicable regulatory codes and standards
 "NTSB, FRA, FTA, OSHA, safety recommendations, guidance, initiatives, and alerts
 Nonconformance Reports, Corrective Action Reports (NCR and CARS)
Examples of observed hazards may include:
 An uneven sidewalk joint that could cause a trip and fall
 Opening in a section of corridor fencing which allows access of a trespasser

The RTD hazard logs (by mode – light rail, bus) are managed by the transit safety specialists
(TSS). Hazards identified by an employee to his/her supervisor may be resolved by the employee
and supervisor. For example, a discharged fire extinguisher may be identified by an employee and
brought to the attention of his/her supervisor and the supervisor gives the employee authorization
to order a newly charged extinguisher from the supply room for a replacement. If the supervisor
is unable to solve the identified hazard, he/she will forward the hazard to a safety committee
representative to be brought to the safety committee for resolution. The safety committee and
TSS will review the hazard and assign an initial hazard rating (IHR) and place the hazard into the
hazard reporting system to be tracked. The following flow process will be followed by employees
in identifying and correcting hazards at the employee/supervisor level and actions taken to move
the hazard to the safety committee and beyond if necessary.

II 1.4 Hazard Investigation, Evaluation, and Analysis
RTD is currently in the process of developing and refining a database where incidents and
observed hazards can be tracked and analyzed for leading indicators of potential hazards. This
will allow management to be proactive in correcting hazards.
Safety concerns should be identified and corrected at the lowest level (employee/department) as
soon as practicable. Safety concerns that are not eliminated at this level are reported to a
supervisor or a transit safety specialist. Reported concerns will be assessed by the TSS and or
safety committee to determine if a safety hazard exists and assign an initial hazard rating (IHR).

II 1.4.1

Root Cause Analysis and Accident Evaluation

Hazards are investigated as they are identified through evaluating accidents, incidents, and near
misses. Hazards originating from accidents are reviewed by the transit safety specialist and
respective safety evaluation committees. As part of evaluating accidents and incidents, root cause
analysis using the “FIVE Why?” methodology is used to help focus on the bottom-line
fundamental cause and determine the most effective solutions to mitigating hazards. The primary
purpose of the accident evaluation process is to determine root causes potential hazards that may
have contributed to an incident. A third party expert may be used to assist with an investigation if
deemed necessary. This will be determined based upon a RTD hazard assessments, to be
determined frequent and high (Catastrophic HIGH).
HIGH risk hazards (1A, 1B, 1C, 2A, 2B) that receive an unacceptable initial hazard analysis
made by management, safety committee or the transit safety specialist receive immediate
attention/control. A high hazard rating requires corrective action.
Hazards that receive a high hazard rating will be elevated from the local hazard log to the
electronic hazard reporting system.

LOW (4C, 4D, 4E) hazards do not require review and are acceptable.
ELIMINATED hazard is no longer present.

II 1.4.2

Hazard Reporting Threshold to PUC

RTD will notify the PUC of all identified hazards via the electronic reporting system and
monthly/quarterly reporting. RTD will notify PUC of all hazardous conditions that affect the
immediate safety or security of the rail system in a timely fashion. At a minimum, RTD notifies
PUC within one business day, according to the notification procedures in the PUC standard, of
hazardous conditions that are rated as High and set forth in the transit agency’s Hazard
Identification/Resolution Matrix:
 I-A (Catastrophic/Frequent)
 II-A (Critical/Frequent)
 I-B (Catastrophic/Probable)
 II-B (Critical/Probable)
 I-C (Catastrophic/Occasional)
RTD is responsible for assigning severity/probability ratings to hazardous conditions.
RTD will include in its hazard log and hazard management process hazardous conditions,
incidents, occurrences, and events, including the following:
 Incidents involving individuals working in the transit agency-controlled right of way that
are investigated by the transit agency.
 Malfunctions of safety-critical systems that could result, or have resulted in catastrophic
or single-point failure.
 Broken or missing safety-critical equipment, infrastructure, or systems that could result,
or have resulted, in employee or passenger injury, or damage to RTD property.
 Discoveries of systemic or patterns of employee non-compliance with transit agency
rules and procedures.
 Rail transit vehicle collisions with fixed objects on the mainline or in the yards.
 Rail transit vehicle derailments in the yards.
 Face-up or near miss of rail vehicles.
 Grade crossing warning system activation failure.
 Speed restriction or track closure due to track or facility damage.
 Fire or smoke on the track, on a vehicle, or in a facility.
 Broken or loose wheel or axle.
 Fallen or dragging rail vehicle equipment
 Split switch without derailment

Attachment: 2020 RTD TASP -Final - pdf 11-1-19 (3993 : 2020 Public Transit Agency Safety Plan)

SERIOUS hazards (1D, 2C, 3A, 3B) that are undesirable may require corrective action and
decisions by management. Hazards that receive a serious hazard rating will remain on the local
hazard logs no more than 150 days before being moved to the appropriate Safety Department
Log.

Hazard Severity

Hazard severity is a subjective determination of the worst case that could be anticipated to result
from human error, design inadequacies, component failure or malfunction. The categories of
hazards based on the modified MIL-STD-882 are as follows:
Category 1 Catastrophic - Operating conditions are such that human error, design deficiencies,
element, subsystem or component failure or procedural deficiencies may cause death or major
system loss and require immediate termination of the unsafe activity or operation
Category 2 Critical - operating conditions are such that human error, subsystem or component
failure or procedural deficiencies may cause severe injury, severe occupational illness or major
system damage and require immediate corrective action.
Category 3 Marginal - Operating conditions are such that they may result in minor injury,
occupational illness or system damage and are such that human error, subsystem or component
failures can be counteracted or controlled.
Category 4 Negligible - Operating conditions are such that human error, subsystem or component
failure or procedural deficiencies will result in less than minor injury, occupational illness or
system damage.
The categorization of hazards is consistent with risk-based criteria for severity; it reflects the
principle that not all hazards pose an equal amount of risk to personal safety.

II 1.4.45

Hazard Probability

The probability of a particular event or a specific hazard occurring may be defined as a nondimensional ratio of the number of times that a specific event occurs to the total number of trials
in which this event will occur during the planned life expectancy of a system. Generally, hazard
probability is described qualitatively in potential occurrences per units of time, miles, trips/runs
or passengers carried. A hazard probability may be derived from the analysis of transit system
operating experience, evaluation of RTD safety data, the analysis of reliability and failure data, or
from historical safety data from other passenger rail systems or bus systems. (see Exhibit VIII)

II 1.4.6

Hazard or Risk Assessments

RTD has adopted a system for assessing the level of risk for each identified hazard to determine
what action(s) must be taken to correct or document the hazard risk. This assessment system has
been incorporated into the formal system safety analysis which enables the Transit safety
specialist or safety committees as decision makers to understand the amount of risk involved in
accepting the hazard in relation to the cost (schedule, cost, operations) to reduce the hazard to an
acceptable level.
The Hazard Matrix (6.4.2) identifies the hazard risk index (HRI) based upon hazard category and
probability and the criteria for defining further actions based upon the index.

II 1.5

Hazard Control, Elimination, and Tracking

Safety critical hazards that have been identified must be controlled or eliminated so that the
hazard does not continue to pose a danger. This may be done in a temporary manner as long as
the hazard is controlled. The process of controlling, tracking, and elimination, of hazards is
recorded on the hazard log which is generated from the electronic hazard reporting system. The
hazard log will be forwarded to PUC SSO on a monthly basis.
All hazard log entries require a mitigation plan or corrective action plan (CAP) (depending on
risk ranking), tracking number, brief description, projected completion date, and an initial
hazard/risk rating (IHR/IRR) using the RTD Hazard Analysis Matrix.
Corrective action plans include the following information:
 Element of activity identified as deficient
 Planned activities to resolve deficiency
 RTD department responsible for implementing corrective action
 Scheduled completion date for implementation
 Estimated cost of implementation
Hazard log entries with their associated corrective action plan are reviewed regularly by the
safety department, safety committees, PUC SSO and periodically reviewed by senior
management. CAP's may be tracked and sorted from the hazard log. When a CAP is closed the
hazard log will reflect this action and a closed date.
Individual CAP files are stored in the enterprise content management system by hazard tracking
number.

Hazard Resolution and Elimination

Hazard resolution is defined as the analysis and subsequent actions taken to reduce to the lowest
level practical, the risk associated with an identified hazard. Hazard resolution is not synonymous
with hazard elimination. In a transit environment, there are some hazards, which are impossible to
eliminate and others, which are highly impractical to eliminate. Reduction of risk to the lowest
practical level can be accomplished in a variety of ways from protective and warning devices to
special procedures.
1. Design out or design to minimize hazard severity. To the extent permitted by cost and
practicality, identified hazards will be eliminated or controlled by the design of
equipment, systems and facilities.
2. Hazards that cannot reasonably be eliminated or controlled through design will be
controlled to the extent practicable to an acceptable level through the use of fixed,
automatic, or other protective safety design features or devices. Provisions will be made
for periodic functional checks of safety devices and training for employees to ensure that
system safety objectives are met.
3. When design and safety devices cannot reasonably nor effective, eliminate or control an
identified hazard, safety warning devices will be used (to the extent practicable) to alert
persons to the hazards.
4. Where it is impossible to reasonably eliminate or adequately control a hazard through
design of the use of safety warning devices, procedures and training will be used to
control the hazard.

II 1.6

Hazard Tracking

Each CAP developed for hazards, findings from investigations or deficiencies will be submitted
to PUC SSO as required for review and approval. The CAP form is automatically assigned a
tracking number and placed on the Hazard log with its identified hazard. Upon completion of the
corrective action the safety department will submit to PUC as required. The completed CAP is
formally adopted by receiving PUC SSO's signature. The Hazard Log will then be updated to
show the status of the identified hazard with its CAP to "CLOSED".
RTD will monitor all Corrective Action Plans with the use of the RTD Hazard Log and will
provide PUC with an updated hazard log quarterly.
Internally, the safety department will coordinate with the appropriate department to develop a
Mitigation plan and fill out the appropriate form for the identified hazard. The form will be
assigned a tracking number by the electronic hazard reporting system and placed on the hazard
log with the corresponding hazards for tracking purposes.

Ongoing Reporting To State Safety Oversight Agency

The transit safety specialist will review the current status and identify any issues with the
resolution action and dates. The hazard log, at a minimum is provided to the SSO monthly
All hazards identified and rated as unacceptable hazardous conditions will be separately tracked
and reported to PUC along with the corrective action plans for each unacceptable hazardous
condition found. All hazards identified and rated as unacceptable hazardous conditions will be
separately tracked and reported to PUC with determination of an unacceptable hazardous
condition.
PUC will notify RTD in writing of its acceptance or rejection of the corrective action plan and in
accordance with procedures specified in the PUC SSO standard. The RTD CAP form requires the
PUC SSO electronic or wet signature approval indicating the assigned resolution and completion
of the CAP. The CAP is maintained in the Laserfiche hazard reporting system files and is
identified by a specific hazard log identifier tracking number. After a hazard has been resolved, it
will be assigned its final hazard rating.

II 1.8

Job Safety Briefing

Hazards that are identified in the work area will be recorded on the hazard log which is
maintained by the Transit safety specialist to the specific transportation mode at RTD. All
employees are encouraged to identify and control or resolve hazards at the lowest management
level possible. Employees that perform job tasks are required to discuss job tasks and identified
hazards that are associated with those tasks or job steps during job briefings. Identified hazards
that cannot be controlled with PPE or procedures must be resolved or mitigated through the
hazard management process.

An environmental management system (EMS) is in place at RTD to assure that all materials
ordered have safety data sheet (SDS) forms shipped with the materials or prior to shipment. If
these types of materials are ordered, they are not received until the SDS is provided. SDS forms
are forwarded to the transit safety specialists or and transit environmental specialists who place
the forms in the appropriate SDS database in RTD’s facilities and electronic system.

Packet Pg. 134

1.C.4.a

The EMS policy manual will govern hazardous materials procurement, receiving, storage, use,
and disposal, as well as complying with legal and other requirements. A continual process of
assessment, corrections, and improvement will be adopted by RTD management as a part of the
adoption of the environmental management system program.
During 2013 the new addition of the Globally Harmonized System (GHS) was announced by
OSHA. RTD has incorporated awareness training and announced the new changes to the Hazard
Communications 29 CFR 1200 which are to be implemented over the next two years. All
material safety data sheets (MSDS) will change format and be known as SDS sheets and are
accessible through an Intranet-based system. All MSDS/SDS are available through the SharePoint
Site:
https://otis.osmanager4.com/#/chemical/righttoknow?rtkid=61fabd57-17a7-4a23-88d708aa3caec485&hv=7EBC55B743Z39E5A3578D01BB9E04008
Each employee receives training on hazardous materials management and is instructed as to their
responsibilities right to know about potential hazards that they work with. RTD's safety and
environmental compliance officers, as described in the EMS manual, review compliance with this
manual.

II 2.3

Management of Hazardous Materials

For any hazardous chemical used or stored in the workplace, RTD facilities must maintain a
safety data sheet (SDS), and submit the SDSs (or a list of the chemicals) to their state emergency
response commission (SERC), local emergency planning committee (LEPC), and local fire
department. RTD facilities must also report an annual inventory of these chemicals by March 1 of
each year to their SERC, LEPC, and local fire department. The Environmental Department has
been given this reporting responsibility. The information must be made available to the public.
There are over 2,000 listed hazardous materials and over 600 extremely hazardous chemicals
subject to reporting. Reporting requirements have been limited by quantity. RTD submits an
annual Tier II chemical inventory report for our facilities that are subject to reporting.
The common hazardous materials used by RTD that are subject to reporting are:
 Diesel Fuel
 Gasoline
 New and used oil
 Antifreeze (ethylene glycol)
 Lead acid batteries (sulfuric acid)

Attachment: 2020 RTD TASP -Final - pdf 11-1-19 (3993 : 2020 Public Transit Agency Safety Plan)

RTD will develop a comprehensive Environmental Management System Policy Manual that will
have jurisdiction over all hazardous materials activities and aspects of the organization. RTD
employees and department managers will be provided with and will be required to comply with
this management system. The manual and the EMS standard operating procedures (SOPs) will
require RTD personnel to comply with applicable local, state, and federal regulations.

The liquids are stored in tanks or drums within secondary containment. RTD also uses many
hazardous chemicals contained in soaps, solvents, brake cleaners, paints, and aerosols. These
hazardous materials are described in the product-specific safety data sheets (SDS).
70
Packet Pg. 135

RTD is also a small quantity generator of hazardous waste. Hazardous waste is a hazardous
material that has outlived its usefulness or has become contaminated through use. Hazardous
wastes, can be generated by:
 Discarding a hazardous material (oil-based paint, pesticides, some soaps, expired
products)
 Using a product (used batteries, fluorescent lamps, HID lamps, paint thinner, aerosol
dregs)
Hazardous wastes are stored in closed containers and accumulated in satellite accumulation areas.
These containers are labeled hazardous waste and are located near where the waste is generated.
The environmental compliance officers are responsible for preparing appropriate manifests,
scheduling hazardous materials transportation, and final disposal.

Element III of the Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan is Safety Assurance, which
describes how RTD will measure and review its processes to ensure that it remains in compliance
with established standards. These processes, safety performance targets, and reports will provide
the confidence to RTD leadership that the organization and system is functioning in an acceptable
level of safety. The reviews, inspections, rules checks and compliance verification procedures are
described, required schedules set and acceptable measures established.

III 1 Internal Safety Review Process
Internal safety reviews and inspections are critical components of an integrated system safety
program. As such, internal safety reviews of the light rail system are conducted semiannually
parallel to the PUC to assure compliance with the System Safety Program Plan and that the plan
is effectively implemented. Facilities are inspected monthly for occupational safety issues and
local fire codes. The overall light rail system is reviewed to assure that activities required by
RTD’s operating, maintenance, and System Safety Program Plan are completed. Written reports
of each review are prepared and distributed to the various light rail departments reviewed. The
Executive Safety and Security Committee may also discuss safety reviews, evaluate the
effectiveness of the System Safety Program Plan, recommend corrective action if necessary, and
ensure timely implementation and follow up. An annual internal light rail review report is
compiled in January of each year and submitted to the PUC by February 15 of each year. The
report documents the review findings for the year including the results of the internal reviews
performed during the previous year, a summary of required corrective actions taken, if any, and
provision for follow up to ensure timely implementation and to determine effectiveness of the
system safety program plan. The annual report will be accompanied by a formal letter of
certification signed by the General Manager indicating that the RTD is in compliance with its
system safety program plan and system security plan. If RTD identifies areas of deficiency, the
General Manager, by letter, will identify the activities RTD will take to achieve compliance.
Documentation of inspection and reviews are maintained in the Safety and Environmental
Division.
As part of the safety review program, all RTD departments are subject to review. Under the
direction of the Assistant General Manager of Safety, Security and Asset Management, the Senior
Manager of Safety and Environmental is responsible for and has complete authority to conduct
internal safety reviews. Two reviews are conducted each year, one in the spring and one in the
fall. Within a three-year period, all system safety plan elements are reviewed for compliance with
the plan and state safety oversight requirements. The sixth review cycle is usually reserved to
review and revise the review process to assure that all elements are completed and that the
program meets the state safety oversight requirements.

III ASSURANCE

RTD will notify the PUC of an upcoming review cycle at least 30 days prior to the start of the
safety review. The review team consists of representatives from the Safety Unit of RTD. Each
checklist is assigned a lead reviewer for the final development of the checklist and to be the
responsible person to complete the checklist including back up documentation when the review
cycle is complete.

73
Packet Pg. 138

An opening conference may be scheduled with the departments subject to safety review; in some
cases an opening conference is not required. At the opening conference, the checklists are
distributed and each checklist is discussed and reviewed for accuracy; the schedule is then set
with the affected departments. The actual internal safety review consists of interviews with key
personnel, documentation review, and observation of activities to assess compliance and
understanding of rules, training, and procedures. After completion of the onsite activities, the
checklists are completed and a written draft report is developed. The draft report may include
recommendations or findings. Recommendations are defined as suggestions to make
improvements, while findings are defined as documented deficiencies in the implementation of
established programs, rules or procedures. The draft report is distributed for review and comment
to the affected parties. Parties have 30 days to respond to the draft report including an
opportunity to correct any findings. A final report is completed and distributed to all parties.
Recorded findings require the development of a corrective action plan. Each year, the annual
internal safety review report is prepared and submitted to the PUC, will include an evaluation of
the adequacy and effectiveness of the System Safety Program Plan.
Recommendation and findings will be tracked in two ways. Recommendations from previous
review cycles will be reviewed and evaluated in subsequent cycles. Findings will be tracked
under the corrective action plan process of placing all findings on a tracking spreadsheet and the
subsequent quarterly corrective action plan progress reports filed with the PUC.

III 1.1 Inspections and Reviews
The Safety Division conducts periodic inspections and safety reviews. Maintenance facilities are
inspected monthly to ensure compliance with occupational safety regulations and local fire codes.
Semiannual safety reviews are conducted in parallel with the Colorado Public Utilities
Commission to document compliance with established standard operating procedures,
maintenance plans and the Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan. Any deviations from
required activities or identified safety hazards are resolved through a formal reporting process.
For additional information on system safety reviews, refer to section 5.3.

III 1.2 Accident Investigation, Notification, Reporting and Corrective Action Plans
Formal investigations shall be conducted for all light rail and bus accidents. All accidents are
investigated by either a Light Rail Supervisor or Transportation Street Supervisor Regarding bus
accidents, if damage is minor, personnel are unavailable or certain weather conditions exist,
operators may be instructed by Dispatch or law enforcement personnel to just complete an
accident report. Subsequent accident investigation reports are completed and distributed to the
Operations Division and the Safety and Environmental Division.
Light rail control will notify Safety Division of every accident that meets the criteria listed below.
Upon notification, Safety Division will determine the level of investigation to be performed by
the Safety Unit. Light rail accidents and incidents are investigated according to RTD Standard
Operating Procedure 103.2 – Incident/Accident Investigation.

Attachment: 2020 RTD TASP -Final - pdf 11-1-19 (3993 : 2020 Public Transit Agency Safety Plan)

1.C.4.a

This procedure is included as Exhibit V.
Safety Division personnel will either conduct light rail accident investigations or evaluate
accident investigation reports conducted by others, determine which agencies require notification
74
Packet Pg. 139

and make notification, determine most probable cause, prepare all necessary reports for the PUC
and other agencies, coordinate the preparation and implementation of corrective action plans if
necessary, prepare an accident tracking matrix, and provide summaries to the Executive Safety
and Security Committee. Light rail accidents will be tracked and evaluated by the Executive
Safety and Security Committee. The Safety Division will also coordinate all accident
investigation activities with the PUC and will provide as much advance notice as practical to
notify the PUC of an accident investigation. When investigating an accident as defined in rule
7347(a), RTD will give prior sufficient telephone or facsimile notice to the PUC's staff of the
times that an accident investigation team will convene to conduct interviews, inspections,
examinations, or tests to determine the cause of the accident.
Serious bus accidents are similarly investigated by the Accident Investigation Team consisting of
the following members: Street Supervisors, Manager of Dispatch-Street Supervision, Liability
Claims Representative, Division Manager, Manager of the bus operator’s division, Transportation
Manager of the bus operator’s division, Transit safety specialist/Bus Operations, and Technical
Services Representative.
Notification is required within two hours pursuant to 4 CCR 723-7-7348(a) for any accident
occurring on an RFGPTS where one or more of the following occurs:
1. Fatality at the scene, or confirmation of death within 30 days of accident
2. Serious Injuries as defined in Rule 7341 (tt) requiring immediate medical attention away
from the scene for one or more individuals
3. Property damage resulting from a collision involving a rail transit vehicle
4. An evacuation due to life safety reasons
5. A collision at a grade crossing
6. A derailment of a rail transit vehicle
7. A runaway train
8. A collision between a rail transit vehicle and a second rail transit vehicle, or a rail transit
non-revenue vehicle
Accident notification under 4-CCR 723-7, 7347(b) is not required by RTD as RTD has no light
rail track that is shared with the general railroad system.
RTD will also provide accident follow-up notification by e-mail in the form of a checklist to the
PUC including the following information:
 The nature of the accident as described above.
 The time, date, and location of the accident.
 The time and date of the notification to the PUC.
 A description of the vehicles, rail transit vehicles, passengers, individuals, rail transitcontrolled property, and other property involved in the accident and the direction they
were traveling at the time of the incident, if known.
For accidents involving a rail transit vehicle or taking place on rail transit-controlled property
where one or more of the above thresholds are met, the RTD will conduct accident investigations
for RTD and on behalf of the PUC. Written accident investigation reports will be provided to the
PUC within 45 days from the date of occurrence and shall include the following:

System safety data is collected through a variety of sources including near miss information,
accident investigation reports, internal safety reviews, safety committee meetings, occupational
injury reports, incident reports, use of an accident matrix, system monitoring including testing
and inspection records, and the hazard management program. This safety data will be analyzed,
and used for development of Key Safety Performance Indicators and Targets. RTD will initially
focus on areas based on data delivered to the National Transit Database (NTD), as the following:





Fatalities – total number of reportable fatalities and rate per total vehicle revenue miles
by mode
Injuries – total number of reportable injuries and rate per total vehicle revenue miles by
mode
Safety Events – total number of reportable events and rate per total vehicle revenue miles
by mode
System Reliability – mean distance between major mechanical failures by mode

These safety performance measures are used to select improvement targets for these four
measures and for each mode of transit, in order to encourage improvements and monitor the
safety performance of delivering transit services. In addition, RTD will select additional
performance measures and targets, both leading and lagging, to insure continual improvement of
our Safety Management System.
RTD will make its safety performance measures improvement targets available to applicable
State agencies (i.e. CDOT) and metropolitan planning organizations (currently Denver Regional
Council of Governments – DRCOG) (together, “External Entities”); and, to the maximum extent
practicable, will coordinate with the External Entities in the selection of External Entity safety
performance targets.
The safety data collected from the above sources will be analyzed for potential safety impacts.
Identified areas of concern are reported to appropriate personnel in the form of specific project
reports, memos, and recommendations from the Executive Safety and Security Committee.
Records of system safety data are maintained in the office of the Safety and Environmental
Division for a minimum of three years. Certain information, such as safety certification back up
documentation is maintained by RTD’s document control process managed by the Capital
Programs Department. In addition to safety, the Safety and Environmental Division maintains
data and documentation of activities required by the System Safety Program Plan. Distribution of
safety-related reports and data is accomplished through the RTD Executive Safety and Security
Committee.

System modifications are managed according to Light Rail Standard Operating Procedure 101.11,
Light Rail System Change Procedure. The SOP defines system change as follows: modifications,
alterations, additions, or deletions to the contracts, specifications, components, equipment or
facilities affecting any part of the light rail operating system.
This procedure is intended to assure that any potential hazards that may be introduced through
system modification are addressed through RTD’s hazard management program, and affected
RTD Departments are afforded the opportunity and given due consideration for any proposed
change or modification to the light rail system. System changes are proposed by submitting a
“Proposal for LRT System Change” form. This system change form includes the following
information:






Brief description including support data
Description of benefits expected
Resources required
Operation implications
Safety considerations

Completed forms are forwarded to the initiator’s supervisor, department head, and lastly to the
Executive Safety and Security Committee via the Assistant General Manager of Safety, Security
and Asset Management. Upon receipt of the proposed change, the Safety Unit determines if a
preliminary hazard analysis (PHA) is necessary. If a PHA is necessary, it is performed by the
Safety Unit. All information is distributed to the Executive Safety and Security Committee for
evaluation based on safety, operational, and cost criteria. The Committee must reach consensus
for the proposal to be accepted. Recommended proposals are forwarded to the Assistant General
Manager of Rail Operations for final signature approval. A review schedule is followed to ensure
proposals are evaluated in a timely manner. The Executive Safety and Security Committee meets
monthly to address proposals and other light rail safety and security issues.
Documentation is accomplished by tracking the system change form and keeping a log of
proposed changes with notes and final action disposition. The scope of this section applies to the
light rail system.
Management of Change/Configuration management is managed in a similar fashion. Authority to
make configuration changes lies with the Infrastructure Change Review Committee with the
consensus of the Executive Safety and Security Committee. The process for making configuration
changes is controlled by the Executive Safety and Security Committee. Specific members of the
Executive Safety and Security Committee participate in the design review and acceptance of
modifications, new equipment and facilities, and system expansion. In managing this process
through the Executive Safety and Security Committee, all departments are assured the
opportunity to review and provide input. Design is further controlled by RTD’s Light Rail Design
Criteria. Any deviation from the design criteria must be approved by the Executive Safety and
Security Committee. The formal safety certification process is applied to system expansions and
new systems. Refer to safety certification section for additional information.

New Equipment, System Expansion, and Modifications Hazard

New equipment, system expansions, and modifications are included in the hazard management
program process as described in sections 3.3.2, 3.3.3, and 3.3.4. This process is administered by
the Safety and Environmental Division and performed jointly by the Engineering Division, the
Light Rail Operations Division, and the Safety and Environmental Division. New equipment,
system expansions, and modifications are ultimately reviewed, approved, and documented by the
Executive Safety and Security Committee.

III 1.5.2

New Equipment, System Expansion, and Modification Review

New equipment, system expansions, and modifications are reviewed and approved by the
Engineering Division, the Light Rail Operations Division, and the Safety and Environmental
Division. This review is conducted to assure that new equipment, expansions, and modifications
safely and operationally integrate into the existing system.

III 1.5.3
Acceptance

New Equipment, System Expansion, and Modification

Operational readiness of new equipment and system expansions is verified through the equipment
acceptance and safety and security certification process. The Light Rail Operations Division
performs rigorous equipment and integration testing as part of the Vehicle and Equipment
Acceptance process. Once complete, new vehicles and equipment are formally accepted by the
Light Rail Operations Division. This information is presented and approved by the Safety
Certification Program and described in section 3.3.13. The Safety and Security Certification
Program provides an identification, design, review and verification process for system expansions
and modifications. Certification process completion is verified by sign-off from the Chairman of
the Executive Safety and Security Committee.

III 1.5.4

Exceptions to Established Design Criteria

Level 4 and above exceptions to RTD’s Light Rail Design Criteria are approved only by the
acceptance of the Executive Safety and Security Committee. If appropriate, the Design Criteria
may be amended or modified to accommodate acceptable modifications. The Assistant General
Manager of Capital Programs is responsible for the maintenance and distribution of the light rail
design criteria.

III 1.5.5

Procurement Procedures

Procurement of equipment and materials is controlled by RTD’s Procurement Standards Manual.
Each procurement requires the development of detailed specifications assembled by the
requesting manager. Levels of review are built into the procurement process depending upon the
scope of the procurement. As the scope of the procurement increases, so does the level of review.
Minor procurements require authorization from the Contracts and Procurement division and the
Division Manager of the requesting division. Major procurements such as light rail construction
related projects or procurement of light rail vehicles, are subject to the following review process.
The Engineering Division and Technical Support Staff develop detailed specifications through

the design process. These specifications are subject to several internal reviews at varying levels of
design, peer reviews by personnel from other transit agencies, and ultimate approval by the
Executive Safety and Security Committee. In addition to procurement specifications, the Safety
and Security Certification Review Process described in Section 3.3.13 governs light rail
construction. This procurement procedure in combination with the system modification
procedure, established design criteria, and hazard communication program precludes the
introduction of unauthorized hazardous materials and supplies as well as defective or deficient
equipment into the District’s Transit Systems.

III 2 Management of Change
Management of Change/Configuration control within RTD will be managed through the
Infrastructure Change Review (ICR) process during design and construction. The ICR process is
managed for RTD by Capital Development. The MOC process is managed by the Executive
Safety and Security Committee (ESSC) chaired by the chief safety officer. Management of
Change/Configuration management within RTD consists of the ICR process during design and
construction, and the management of change (MOC) process during operations, in coordination
with the ESSC.
The ICR process is managed for RTD by Capital Programs Department, and coordinates new
systems or extensions before they are implemented in the existing operating environment. Project
managers use the Project Management Plan (PMP) to guide capital projects. In addition to the
Project Management Plan (PMP) the Project Control Specialist will implement guidance from the
Project Control User Manual. This manual is updated periodically and contains direction for as
built and document control procedures. Specific guidance for document control procedures, File
Creation (4.2), File codes, is provided in the Project Control User Manual Section 4.0. Smaller
projects may include an abbreviated PMP specific to the project.
Representatives from each involved department and safety are represented in the ICR process.
Project changes to existing structures or facilities is critical that effected RTD personnel, public,
or other affected groups be notified of the change which might have potential safety or security
impacts. Affected personnel are invited to participate in project meetings and coordinate any
changes. Additional training may be required. Operations and maintenance procedures, bulletins
or SOP’s may need to be developed. General public may be affected. The Public Relations
Department personnel assist with communications to outside agencies or effected groups. There
is an essential element of communications that must take place after the project is completed and
being used. Any observed negative or hazardous impacts of a change must be reported to
management personnel as soon as possible.

III 2.1 Safety and Security Certification
System Safety personnel develop and implement Safety and Security Certification Programs to
assure that safety and security concerns and hazards are addressed prior to the initiation of rail
passenger operations for new corridors, system extensions, rehabilitation, modification or
replacement of equipment. RTD utilizes the FTA Handbook for Transit Safety and Security
Certification to develop the requirements for each safety and security certification program. An
individual safety and security certification plan is developed for each new corridor. For minor
extensions or projects, safety and security certification is addressed through the preparation of
safety and security certification forms applicable to the scope of work. Modifications are
managed through the light rail change/modification process. Regarding new equipment, if it is
procured as part of a new maintenance facility, the equipment is included in the certification

program for the facility. Rail vehicles undergo a formalized acceptance program under the
supervision of rail operations. The Safety and Security Certification Program has the following
goals: verify that acceptable safety and security levels are met or exceeded; document the
verification of safety and security standards; and provide consistency for project certification.
With these goals in mind, the objectives of the Program can be more narrowly defined.
Objectives of the Program include: identify and verify safety and security requirements of the
system design; identify and verify safety and security requirements for construction and system
equipment installation; identify and verify safety and security requirements are met or exceeded
for system testing; and identify and verify safety and security requirements are met for changes or
modifications to standard operating procedures, training manuals, rule book, and system
elements. Under the direction of the RTD Chief Safety Officer, Assistant General Manager of
Safety, Security and Asset Management, the Senior Manager of Safety and Environmental and
the System Safety and Security Manager are responsible for the management of the Program. The
Executive Safety and Security Committee, chaired by the Assistant General Manager of Safety,
Security and Asset Management, oversee the process, in coordination with the ICR.

III 2.2 Quality Assurance
Large projects at RTD have a quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) function built into the
design and construction of the project. Specific personnel are responsible for QA/QC activities. In
general, QA/QC activities in large projects follow standard industry practice and are subject to
review by the FTA and others. Quality control during construction projects is a requirement of the
contractor, and submitted in his quality plan prior to initiation of construction. RTD retains
qualified inspectors and testing firms to provide Quality Assurance by document submittal
reviews and periodic testing of materials throughout the project.
Received goods are compared to items ordered, lot numbering or other certifications as required
on safety critical items. Where applicable, receiving personnel assure that lot number
documentation is provided before materials are received or accepted. Periodically, purchasing
personnel or transit safety specialists will randomly sample hardware, slings, lifting devices, and
other devices for compliance with specifications. Items will also be periodically functionally
tested to assure they meet standards.

III 3 Rules Compliance
III 3.1 Reports and Data Analysis
The results of the operational tests are compiled and reviewed quarterly by the Manager of Rail
Operations or a designated supervisor(s) and the Safety Manager. A written form of the
discussion and review will be provided to the Safety Department within 30 days after the end of
the quarter. An annual report is completed by a designated supervisor(s) summarizing the
previous year’s results of the operational tests. The annual report is turned over to the Safety
Department for further review and trend analysis. See SOP 109.23 Operational Rule Compliance
Testing.

III 3.1.1

Enforcement Violations

Rule violations are addressed through the corporate positive people management process (PPM)
which includes: coaching, retraining, and, formal discipline (performance agreement and
termination) that may result in termination. See RTD Corporate Policy 6.3.1. Rail operations
maintains a log for all stop indications and wrong route violations, and may further investigate
any rules violation that is reported, or that may be part of an accident or incident. Additionally, all
accidents and incidents are reviewed by supervisors and the safety administrator to determine if
rules have been violated, or if revisions, changes, or additions are necessary.

III 3.1.2

Hazard Management

The transit safety specialist may incorporate violation trends or deficiencies for any rule or
procedure into the hazard management program for resolution. Hazards unresolved by the Rail
Safety Committee (RSC) are directed to the SSRC committee for further tracking, review,
resolution, and or correction. Non-compliant review findings determined to be hazardous are
documented in the hazard log. A date of observation, description of the hazardous condition,
corrective action required, and implementation date are tracked until the hazardous condition is
corrected. See the Hazard Management Program portion of the PTASP for further information.
The Safety Administrator conducts ongoing and regular observations and reviews to determine
the effectiveness of the rule compliance program. Rail Service and the Rail Safety Committee
review rules and procedures regularly to determine if changes, revisions, or additions are
necessary.

III 3.2 Standard Operating Procedures and Employee Rule Book
Adopted Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and the Employee Rule Books strictly govern
light rail operations. The SOP manual is comprehensive with procedures for every aspect of light
rail operation including: administration, communication, operations- normal, operations-

Packet Pg. 149

abnormal, safety, and signals/switches. SOPs are reviewed periodically and updated as necessary
according to the following guidelines: prior to revenue service of a system expansion or new
corridor; prior to opening a new rail maintenance facility; or as recommended by the internal
safety review process. A committee consisting of Light Rail Controller/Supervisors, Operators,
and the Light Rail Transit safety specialist performs review. Recommended SOP changes are
reviewed and approved by the Assistant General Manager of Rail Operations and then sent for
review and approval by the Executive Safety and Security Committee.
The Employee Rule Book contains the body of RTD’s light rail operating rules. It has been
designed to meet the following three purposes to ensure the safe operation of the system.
 To identify RTD’s operating practices and standards;
 To aid in the instruction of these practices; and
 To serve employees as a reference manual whenever questions rise on the safest course of
action.
The Rule Book contains the General Manager’s Statement, instructions for use, types of operating
regulations, and the operations policy statement. Rules are segregated by the following
categories: safety rules, general rules, train operating rules, and standard operating procedures.
The Rule Book is printed in a portable format for ease of reference. Similar to the SOPs, the Rule
Book is periodically reviewed and updated as necessary according to the following guidelines:
prior to revenue service of a system expansion or new corridor; prior to opening a new rail
maintenance facility; or as recommended by the internal safety review process.

III 3.3 Emergency and Contingency Planning
The RTD outlines emergency and contingency plans in the Light Rail Emergency Response Plan.
The purpose of this program is to provide direction to RTD and emergency response personnel in
the case of an emergency situation, which adversely affects operations. There is a training
component to familiarize Denver metropolitan area emergency response agency personnel with
safety features and operating characteristics of RTD’s Light Rail Transit system.
Included in the program are brief descriptions of system elements and illustrations that depict
these elements.
The objectives of this program are threefold:




Generate common knowledge among personnel in emergency response agencies, such as
police and fire departments as well as paramedic units, to enhance their interaction with
RTD personnel when required;
Minimize potential danger to passengers during incidents, emergency or otherwise, that
requires response from agencies external to RTD; and
Maximize the effectiveness of responding personnel dealing with emergency situations
by increasing their overall knowledge of unique elements within the respective
communities.

Emergency response procedures (internal RTD standard operating procedures) are reviewed and
revised as necessary and distributed to RTD personnel accordingly. Additional information
regarding emergency management is included in Section I 6.1.

III 3.4 Standard Operating Procedures and Employee Rule Book
Bus Operations are strictly governed by policies and procedures outlined in the “Trailblazer”.
Standard rules of conduct and procedure are necessary. The rules outlined in this document have
been adopted for the requirements of RTD’s operations and are considered necessary for
rendering a quality level of service to customers. The “Trailblazer” is comprehensive manual with
procedures and guidelines for every aspect of bus operations including: the performance code;
passenger relations and interaction; ADA requirements; personnel practices; operating
procedures; emergency and legal procedures; equipment care and operation; personal appearance;
radio procedures; fares, transfers, and passes; operation procedures; routes maps and diagrams;
maintenance tips; fleet data; and street guides.
Service Planning/Scheduling updates the “Trailblazer” on an as-needed basis. Transportation
bulletins are a common practice that addresses day to day issues.

Review of Standard Operating Procedures and Employee Rule

The Safety personnel review Standard Operating Procedures (SOP), the Trailblazer, and the
Employee Rule Book as necessary. These reviews are conducted when system monitoring and
data analysis imply that either the SOPs or rules are not as effective as possible, or when change
or expansion to operations occurs. Review also occurs during the RTD internal safety review
process. Recommendations for any policy or rule change are presented to the Executive Safety
and Security Committee for approval.

III 4 Facilities, Structures and Equipment Inspections
RTD's bus and rail facilities and equipment will be inspected on a regular basis according to
company policies and SOPs, equipment manufacturer's guidelines and recommendations, and as
required by local, state, and federal regulations.

III 4.1 Facilities and Equipment to Be Inspected
Operating facilities and equipment routinely inspected and tested by employees, supervisors,
management, and safety and environmental personnel include the following:
 Bus and rail maintenance/support shops/administrative offices, and equipment within the
shops
 Fire system equipment
 Safety eyewash and shower systems
 Floor and portable hoist systems and cranes
 Heating, air conditioning, lighting, and ventilation systems
 Hydraulic presses, grinders, welders, wheel-truing equipment, lathes, etc.
 Hazardous materials handling and storage, etc.
 Locomotives, cab-cars, passenger cars, light rail vehicles, and buses
 Support equipment (i.e. rolling stock) including high-rail vehicles, track maintenance
vehicles, bucket trucks, loaders, forklifts, aerial lifts, etc.
 Infrastructure including rail station platforms, track, switches, OCS, bridges, gradecrossing equipment, etc.

III 4.2 Techniques, Schedules, and Procedures
Preventative maintenance inspection schedules are generated through the computer system per
equipment manufacturer's guidelines and recommendations, and as required by local, state, and
federal regulations. A maintenance supervisor identifies upcoming PM inspections and assigns
the work out to their crew for completion. Inspectors use checklists to identify potential physical
hazards, unsafe equipment, unsafe acts, and policy and procedural deficiencies with the facility or
equipment being inspected. Completed inspection reports and checklists are returned to the
supervisor for review. Each department is responsible for maintaining inspection and repair
records to confirm the inspection process.

Tracking and Resolving Hazards Identified During Inspections

The majority of safety hazards and concerns are resolved immediately by employees, and
supervisors, and require no formal tracking process. Safety-critical hazards that cannot receive
immediate attention are forwarded to the appropriate supervision and will be reported to the
safety administrator or safety committee. An observed safety critical hazard that cannot be
corrected in a timely manner will be entered into the hazard log for tracking purposes and
managed by the SSRC committee. A corrective action plan, responsible person, and completion
date will be assigned. Follow-up inspections will verify that the hazard has been resolved.

III 4.4

Railroad Bridge Safety Management and Inspection Program

The railroad Bridge Safety Management Program (BSMP) has been developed and implemented
by RTD to minimize damages and identify and repair deficiencies in bridges carrying RTD
traffic, to safeguard their ability to carry RTD traffic, and to minimize risk of human casualties.

III 5 System Safety Inspections and Reviews
The Safety Division conducts periodic inspections and reviews. Maintenance facilities are
inspected monthly to ensure compliance with occupational safety regulations and local fire codes.
Semiannual reviews are conducted in conjunction with the Colorado Public Utilities Commission
to document compliance with established standard operating procedures, maintenance plans and
the Public Transit Agency Safety Plan. Any deviations from required activities or identified
safety hazards are resolved through a formal reporting process. For additional information on
system safety reviews, refer to section 5.3.

III 5.1 Internal Safety Review Process
Internal safety reviews and inspections are critical components of an integrated system safety
program. As such, internal safety reviews of the light rail system are conducted semiannually to
assure compliance with the Public Transit Agency Safety Plan (PTASP) and that the plan is
effectively implemented. Facilities are inspected monthly for occupational safety issues and local
fire codes. The overall light rail and bus systems are reviewed to assure that activities required by
RTD’s operating, maintenance, and PTASP are completed. Written reports of each review are
prepared and distributed to the reviewed parties. The Executive Safety and Security Committee
may also discuss review findings, evaluate the effectiveness of the Public Transit Agency Safety
Plan, recommend corrective action if necessary, and ensure timely implementation and follow up.
An annual internal light rail review report is compiled in January of each year and submitted to
the PUC by February 15 of each year. The report documents the review findings for the year
including the results of the internal reviews performed during the previous year, a summary of

Attachment: 2020 RTD TASP -Final - pdf 11-1-19 (3993 : 2020 Public Transit Agency Safety Plan)

Line and Signal uses a maintenance of way plan “MOW Procedures” that outlines specific testing
and maintenance procedures in accordance with FRA regulations. These are in accordance 49
CFR parts 233 - 236.
Right of way rail maintenance uses a maintenance plan “rail maintenance standards” to maintain
the track in accordance with FRA regulations 49 CFR part 213. The standard outlines all aspects
of proper maintenance and inspections regarding track.

required corrective actions taken, if any, and provision for follow up to ensure timely
implementation and to determine effectiveness of the system safety program plan. The annual
report will be accompanied by a formal letter of certification signed by the General Manager
indicating that the RTD is in compliance with its system safety program plan and system security
plan. If RTD identifies areas of deficiency, the General Manager, by letter, will identify the
activities RTD will take to achieve compliance. Documentation of inspection and reviews are
maintained in the Safety and Environmental Division.
As part of the internal review program, all RTD departments are subject to review under the
direction of the Assistant General Manager of Safety, Security and Asset Management, the Senior
Manager of Safety and Environmental is responsible for and has complete authority to conduct
internal safety reviews. Two reviews are conducted each year. Within a three-year period, all
system safety program plan elements are reviewed for compliance with the plan and state safety
oversight requirements. The sixth review cycle is usually reserved to review the review process to
assure that all elements are completed and that the review program meets the state safety
oversight requirements.
RTD will notify the PUC of an upcoming review cycle at least 30 days prior to the start of the
review. The internal review team consists of representatives from the Safety Unit of RTD. Each
checklist is assigned a lead reviewer for the final development of the checklist and to be the
responsible person to complete the checklist including back up documentation when the review is
complete. When a review element under the administration of the Safety and Environmental
Division is conducted, PUC staff serves as the lead reviewer to assure an independent review
process. Written checklists are developed by the lead reviewer.
An opening conference may be scheduled with the departments subject to review and the review
team. In some cases an opening conference is not required. At the opening conference, the
checklists are distributed and each checklist is discussed and reviewed for accuracy. The review
schedule is then set with the affected departments. The actual review consists of interviews with
key personnel, documentation review, and observation of activities to assess compliance and
understanding of rules, training, and procedures. After completion of the onsite review activities,
the checklists are completed and a written draft report is developed. The draft report may include
recommendations or findings. Recommendations are defined as suggestions to make
improvements, while findings are defined as documented deficiencies in the implementation of
established programs, rules or procedures. The draft report is distributed for review and comment
to the reviewed parties. Reviewed parties have 30 days to respond to the draft report including an
opportunity to correct any findings. A final report is completed and distributed to the reviewed
parties. Recorded findings require the development of a corrective action plan. Each year, the
annual review report prepared and submitted to the PUC, will include an evaluation of the
adequacy and effectiveness of the new Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan.
Recommendation and findings will be tracked in two ways. Recommendations from previous
review cycles will be reviewed and evaluated in subsequent review cycles. Findings will be
tracked under the corrective action plan process of placing all findings on a tracking spreadsheet
and the subsequent quarterly corrective action plan progress reports filed with the PUC.

Maintenance

89
Packet Pg. 154

1.C.4.a

Safety critical equipment that does not meet established requirements is withdrawn from service.
Vehicles or equipment that are involved in an accident are removed from service if there is reason
to suspect equipment failure contributed to the cause of the accident or if a fatality is involved.
Vehicles or equipment are returned to service only after it is determined that there are no defects
that could have contributed to the accident. The light rail maintenance crew has an established
strategic plan to ensure rapid deployment, recovery and return to service in the event of an
emergency.
Effective maintenance is an indispensable prerequisite to safe and efficient light rail and bus
operations. The Maintenance Departments have standards that make safety and reliability the
primary objectives of the system. These goals are met by the incorporation of preventive and
repair maintenance programs for all aspects of the system. These systems include: traction
electrification (substation and overhead wire), signals, trackway, buses, rail vehicles, and support
equipment such as shop equipment, non-revenue vehicles, and facilities (shop, passenger stations,
park-n-rides, right-of-way). The foundation of the rail maintenance documentation material is the
Rail Maintenance Plan. A well-developed plan ensures: 1) a high degree of continuity and
consistency in routine maintenance activities, 2) a structured process for improving the
productivity and efficiency of Rail Maintenance functions, and 3) a fulfillment of FTA’s Section
9 requirements.
The Light Rail Vehicle Maintenance Strategic Plan addresses the following areas: 1) Preventive
maintenance programs will be cost-effective in minimizing service failures. 2) Changes in
preventive maintenance programs may be expected periodically as experience is gained on the
equipment maintained. 3) Preventive maintenance goals and polices will not be altered due to
time constraints or as a cost-reduction measure in times of financial stress. 4) Effective
maintenance procedures require much record keeping and information storage/retrieval. 5) The
technical sophistication of the LRV, the tracking of a large, expensive inventory and the scale of
the physical plant, place a heavy responsibility on the information capabilities of the Rail
Maintenance Department.
The maintenance philosophy for RTD is to incorporate a mix of in-house and contracted
maintenance activities so that the system is safely and efficiently maintained. This type of
philosophy has successfully been implemented in other transit properties. The maintenance
philosophy also utilizes existing RTD transit operations, and in many instances will share
organizational services, personnel, and equipment.
Certain maintenance activities, due to space required, expensive repair/test equipment required, or
semi-skilled labor required, may be considered for contract services. Some of those activities as
listed below may include contracted service.

6.1

Drug and Alcohol Program

The RTD maintains an employee drug and alcohol program in compliance with U.S. Department
of Transportation and Federal Transit Administration regulations and to ensure the safe operation
and maintenance of systems and equipment. The program includes criteria for random testing of
safety sensitive personnel and testing for cause either accident related or from observed behavior.
The RTD Finance and Administration Department manages this program. The program is subject
to frequent review by the FTA. To date, the program has been found exemplary by the FTA.
Drug and alcohol testing and information about drug and alcohol abuse is included in RTD’s
Drug and Alcohol Policy. The program is administered by RTD’s Drug and Alcohol Coordinator
which includes verification of compliance with the program and training. Training is given to all
employees during orientation training. Revisions to the program are distributed to all employees.
If necessary, follow-up training is provided.
Compliance and knowledge of the program is accomplished through direct supervision of
employees and refresher training if necessary.

GENERAL POLICY STATEMENT
The Regional Transportation District is dedicated to providing safe, dependable, and economical
transportation services to the public, and to providing a healthy, safe and satisfying work
environment for our employees. RTD and the Amalgamated Transit Union, Division 1001, agree
that employees of the system must be able to work in a drug and alcohol-free work environment.
92
Packet Pg. 157

1.C.4.a

A successful drug and alcohol program must address the safety implications of drug and alcohol
abuse, and must also institute proper procedures and controls guaranteeing accurate alcohol and
drug testing results, while preserving confidentiality and focusing on rehabilitation through an
effective employee assistance program.
It is the responsibility of all employees to report to work free of alcohol and controlled
substances. At the same time, every effort must be made to protect and respect employees' rights
and privacy.
To meet these goals and comply with legal requirements, RTD has implement this policy to
1. Detect drug or alcohol use in violation of this policy through testing;
2. Encourage employees to obtain treatment and rehabilitation for drug and alcohol
problems;
3. Deter drug or alcohol use in violation of this policy through education, training, and
discipline; and
4. Enforce RTD’s goal of a drug- and alcohol-free work environment through appropriate
discipline.
Drug and alcohol abuse can have profound effects on the health, work, and personal life not only
of the abuser but also the abuser’s family, friends, and the public at large. Employees should be
aware of the signs and symptoms of drug or alcohol problems, and of available methods of
intervening when a substance abuse problem is suspected. Exhibits A to this policy contains
additional discussion of these matters.
This policy was originally adopted by the RTD Board of Directors on October 18, 1994 and
subsequent modifications were adopted by the RTD Board of Directors on September 1998, July
2000, May 2003, July 2011, and March 2013. Many elements of this policy are required by
federal regulations covering persons in safety-sensitive job classifications. Other elements of this
policy are not required by federal regulations but are official RTD policy.
Exhibits B to this policy explains which elements of this policy are not federally required.
Employees wishing to review federal regulations on drug and alcohol use may contact RTD’s
Drug and Alcohol Program Coordinator.
This policy supersedes all other RTD drug, alcohol or substance abuse policies. To the extent that
any elements of this policy may conflict with federal or state regulations as they may be amended
or revised in the future, the regulations shall control. Employees are expected to review, be
familiar with, and obey this policy and all laws concerning drug and alcohol use and testing. All
existing and new RTD employees must receive at least 60 minutes of training on the effects and
consequences of prohibited drug use on personal health, safety, and the work environment, and
the signs and symptoms which may indicate prohibited drug use.
Compliance with this policy, including participation in RTD’s drug and alcohol testing program,
is a required condition of employment.

Attachment: 2020 RTD TASP -Final - pdf 11-1-19 (3993 : 2020 Public Transit Agency Safety Plan)

At the same time, every effort must be made to protect the rights and respect the privacy of all
employees. The employer has the right and duty to protect its employees, passengers and the
public from the adverse effects of drug and alcohol abuse. It is not the intent of the employer to
restrict the employees' off-the-job conduct.

APPLICABILITY
III 6.2.1

Categories of Employees

This policy applies to all safety-sensitive and non-safety-sensitive RTD employees, volunteers,
and contractors. For ease of reference, all of the above persons are referred to in this policy as
"employees" unless otherwise noted. This policy applies to all employees while on the property
of RTD to perform RTD duty or while performing any RTD-related business. Visitors and
vendors are expected to adhere to this policy while on RTD property.
In addition to being subject to all other elements of this policy, employees who perform "safety
sensitive functions" for RTD, as that term is defined in federal regulations 49 CFR Parts 40 as
amended and Part 655, are subject to random drug and alcohol testing and other special
requirements set forth in this policy. Generally, a safety-sensitive function occurs when an
employee is performing, ready to perform or immediately available to perform any duty related to
the safe operation of public transportation.
The following are safety-sensitive functions:
 Operation of a revenue service vehicle, whether or not such vehicle is in revenue service.
 Controlling dispatch or movement of a revenue service vehicle.
 Maintaining revenue service vehicles or equipment used in revenue service.
 Operating a non-revenue service vehicle when required to be operated by a holder of a
CDL.
 Carrying a firearm for security purposes.
 Supervising, where the supervisor performs any function listed in items above.
RTD has reviewed the actual duties performed by employees in all job classifications to
determine which employees perform safety-sensitive functions, and has determined which job
functions may require the performance of safety-sensitive corporate policies.

III 6.3

Employee Safety Training, Certification, Verification and
Performance Testing

RTD employees receive formal training and certification for the work they perform according to
job classification. The categories of safety-related work requiring training and certification are
rail and bus operators, and rail and bus maintainers. The specific programs are discussed below.
However, each training and certification program contains classroom and hands-on training, and
written exams. Certification documentation, including tests and test scores, are maintained in
employee files and are subject to review during the RTD internal safety review program.
Except for the RTD on-track safety training program required of contractors working on or near
RTD rail property, RTD does not train or certify contractors or employees of contractors. The ontrack safety training program is required of contractors prior to issuance of an access permit to
work near or on RTD rail property. The program is usually instructed in a train-the-trainer format
allowing contractors to train their own personnel. Compliance with this program is verified
through in-field observation and examination of contractor’s training cards. The Safety and
Environmental Division maintains a log of all contractors trained under the program.

III 6.2

94
Packet Pg. 159

Regarding performance testing, any operating or maintenance rule is subject to verification and
compliance. Compliance with rules, training and certification requirements is verified in several
ways. Rail and bus operators are frequently observed in the field by supervisors and safety unit
personnel. If supervisors observe an issue, they discuss it with the operator as soon as practical. In
addition to this on-going monitoring and observation, rail and bus operators are subject to formal
ride checks in which supervisors, usually anonymously or covertly, observe bus and rail operators
according to a predetermined criteria or check list. These ride checks are documented, reviewed
with the operator and maintained in the operator’s employee file. These records are subject to
verification during the RTD internal safety review process. If a trend or issue is discovered during
system monitoring, observation and ride checks, they are reported to the RTD Executive Safety
and Security Committee for inclusion into the RTD hazard management program.
Bus, rail and facility maintainers also receive direct supervision including observation and
verification of their maintenance activities. Each piece of work that is assigned to a maintainer is
reviewed and approved for correctness by their immediate supervisor through the work order
process. When a maintainer completes their work assignment, their direct supervisor verifies and
approves the work through observation and signature approval on the work order. In late 2007,
this process was automated in the new enterprise system. The maintainer will enter in the system
that the work is complete, the direct supervisor will verify and approve the work, and then accept
that the work was properly completed in the enterprise system. Maintenance activities are also
observed during the RTD internal safety review process. Supervision is also assessed during the
RTD internal safety review program by the review of documentation and compliance with
schedules. If issues are discovered, they are reported as recommendations or findings in the
review report. Review findings are referred to the Senior Manager of Safety and Environmental
for inclusion in RTD’s hazard management program.

III 6.3.1

Operator Certification

LRV Operators must complete a course on RTD Light Rail Rules and Standard Operating
Procedures before being certified. Written tests, alignment map tests, and practical examination
are administered and must be passed with a minimum correct score of eighty percent. Four of the
six weeks are spent in the LRV in actual operation with a training Supervisor.

III 6.3.2

Operator Annual Re-Certification

Annual re-certification is required of all LRV Operators and Controller/Supervisors.
Controller/Supervisors complete this annual training as they are required to maintain their
operator certification. Re-certification consists of the following: one day review of SOPs, rules
and alignment; review of operators’ performance file including accidents, incidents, near misses
and attendance; LRV ride check with operator; and a written test covering SOPs, rules, and
alignment map. Re- certification requires a score of at least eighty percent.

Bus Operator Training

Bus operators must complete a six-week course on RTD rules and standard operating procedures
before entering service. A series of eight written tests are given throughout each class session.
The certification consists of hands-on and classroom instruction. After the first two days of
instruction, all class participants spend time on the bus daily. Prior to entering service, operators
must pass a final examination with a minimum correct score of seventy-five percent. Operators
must also obtain a CDL.

III 6.3.6

Operator Recertification

Bus operators undergo training after an extended absence from work. The general criteria for
retraining are listed:


Operators, who have been out-of service for up to ninety (90) days due to non- medical
leave of absence of vacation, will be required to undergo retraining for at least one (1)
day before returning to service.



Operators who have been out-of-service for over than thirty (30) days due to medical
reasons or on-the-job injury, will be required to retrain at least one (1) day before
returning to service.



Any operator who is away from the job over thirty (30) days may request and receive
retraining before returning to service.

Bus operators also receive training on new equipment and major changes in procedures.

III 6.3.7

Maintenance Certification

The General Repair Certification Program is a structural program for General Repair mechanics.
This program is voluntary, self-paced program designed to help employees increase their skills
and expertise and to improve opportunity for promotion. The certification process assures that
mechanics have the qualifications, knowledge and skills to perform their jobs. This program has
been divided into nine zones which represent the major skills that mechanics must have. The
skill zones are: Chassis, Power Train, Electrical, Air Systems, Preventative Maintenance,
Wheelchair Lifts, Heating and Air Conditioning, and Brakes.

III 6.3.8

Attachment: 2020 RTD TASP -Final - pdf 11-1-19 (3993 : 2020 Public Transit Agency Safety Plan)

Every maintenance employee has an opportunity to receive up to forty hours of annual refresher
training relating to their responsibilities. Re-certification occurs every two years. Maintenance
personnel must again demonstrate passing scores on a written exam and a hands-on practical
exam.

Safety Training for Safety Personnel and Other Units

Personnel outside the safety unit may receive the Rail System Safety Course and attend APTA
seminars. System safety personnel conduct in-house training for RTD personnel regarding safety
certification, hazard analysis, and construction safety.

III 6.4

Procurement

Procurement of equipment and materials is controlled by RTD’s Procurement Standards Manual.
Each procurement requires the development of detailed specifications assembled by the
requesting manager. Levels of review are built into the procurement process depending upon the
scope of the procurement. As the scope of the procurement increases, so does the level of review.
Minor procurements require authorization from the Contracts and Procurement Division and the
Division Manager of the requesting division. Major procurements, such as light rail construction
related projects or procurement of light rail vehicles, are subject to the following review process.
The Engineering Division and Technical Support Staff develop detailed specifications through
the design process. These specifications are subject to several internal reviews at varying levels of
design, peer reviews by personnel from other transit agencies, and ultimate approval by the
Executive Safety and Security Committee.

Attachment: 2020 RTD TASP -Final - pdf 11-1-19 (3993 : 2020 Public Transit Agency Safety Plan)

Responsibilities

PTASP Committees and Position Responsibilities

RTD implements the PTASP through Leadership and line management and also utilizes a series
of committees and department positions who have responsibility for specific areas, yet work in a
coordinated manner to ensure the safety management systems are in place and providing the
results desired. As related in section 3.2, safety is a key responsibility of all managers at RTD.
All employees have the right to present safety concerns to their immediate supervisor, manager,
or transit safety specialists. Any employee, supervisor, or manager that brings an incident,
accident, safety concern, or hazard, in good faith will not be adversely affected, or be subjected to
harassment or intimidation. These retaliations are not tolerated by RTD.

IV 1.2

PTASP Committees

RTD implements the PTASP through Leadership and line management and also utilizes a series
of committees coordinating bus and rail operation and maintenance services. Concerns, if not
resolved by the manager or supervisor, will be referred to and addressed by the respective safety
committee. The following hierarchy of committees at RTD are established to address all safety
issues.

1.C.4.a

The ESSC committee meets monthly to review reports on safety, accident trends, major
accidents, urgent/safety critical concerns or hazards, internal/external review findings,
certification recommendations, items referred from the SSRC, and other items of concern to the
ESSC for comment, direction, resolution, and execution. Minutes are maintained and
disseminated to members of the committee.

IV 1.2.3
Management of Change/Infrastructure Change Review
(MOC/ICR) Teams or Committees
Management of Change/Configuration control within RTD will be managed through the
Infrastructure Change Review (ICR) process during design and construction. The ICR process is
managed for RTD by Capital Development. The MOC process is managed by the Executive
Safety and Security Committee (ESSC) chaired by the chief safety officer. Management of
Change/Configuration management within RTD consists of the ICR process during design and
construction, and the management of change (MOC) process during operations, in coordination
with the ESSC.
.
MOC process applies to existing bus and rail services systems, vehicles, facilities, and equipment
that may not require formal safety certification but which may have safety impacts.

IV 1.2.4

Bus Safety Committee (BSC)

The bus safety committees coordinate on-going safety efforts within the Transportation,
Facilities, and Maintenance departments of the bus system. They meet monthly to update and
mitigate hazards within their facilities, and on their Systems. Committees are formed for the
District Shops, Platte and Treasury, East Metro, and Boulder Divisions. The BSC committees are
chaired by the Safety Division’s delegate, usually a Transit safety specialist. The committees
consist of up to any manager within the Division, and an employee(s) from the following areas:
bus operators, bus maintenance workers, facilities maintenance workers (to include Service and
Cleaning), Health and Wellness, RTD Security, and any other unique area (i.e. – Treasury). The
union (ATU) appoints bargaining unit employees to the BSC as needed to serve as safety
representatives from the ranks of each department.
Committee members are granted an opportunity to speak, and to present safety issues to the BSC
committee through an open communication process. Minutes will be maintained and distributed
to the members of the BSC, the Transportation Managers, and posted to the local Safety Board in
the division, and be made available to others.

Attachment: 2020 RTD TASP -Final - pdf 11-1-19 (3993 : 2020 Public Transit Agency Safety Plan)

The ESSC reviews and approves safety policies, goals, and objectives. It coordinates the support
and resources needed to maintain high safety standards for all aspects of service and system
safety. The general manager (GM), through the ESSC, is the ultimate authority for safety
certification, system modification, and configuration management. This authority includes
approving each project's safety and security certification statement.

The BSC minutes will contain an open item log listing issues brought forward at BSC meetings,
submitted through the Hazard Management System, and the Safety Suggestion Boxes posted at
each Division. The log will include the month/year the item was brought forward to the

committee, an initial hazard rating (Risk Assessment Code), and the estimated month/year the
corrective action will be complete. There will also be a log of closed/completed items, as well as
informational items for RTD employees. This log will be posted at each Division for all
employees to view. Most safety issues will be resolved within the parameters of the BSC. Issues
not resolved in the BSC, or safety critical hazards, are referred to the SSRC.
BSC actions will include the following:
 Reviews facility and operations system safety issues identified by members, staff,
reviews, or inspections
 Assigns responsibility for correcting hazards
 Reviews open items for completion
 Ensure safety and regulatory rule compliance (FTA, PUC)

IV 1.2.5

Rail Safety Committee (RSC)

The rail safety committees (RSC) coordinate on-going safety efforts within the operations and
maintenance services of the rail system. They meet monthly to update and mitigate hazards in
their facilities and on their systems. A committee is formed for light rail. The committees consist
of the Operations manager, two representatives (one Union rep, one admin rep) from operations,
LRV maintenance , Facility Maintenance, Maintenance of Way and the transit safety specialistrail, who serves as a technical advisor and Chair to the committee. The corresponding
maintenance facilities (Elati, Rio Court, and Mariposa) are represented respectively on their RSC.
The union appoints bargaining unit employees to the RSC annually to serve as safety
representatives from the ranks of each department, voicing safety concerns to the RSC.
Committee members are granted an opportunity to speak, and to present safety issues to the RSC
committee through an open communication process. Minutes of discussion and action will be
maintained and distributed to the members of the RSC, and be available to others.
The RSC will maintain a local hazard log listing issues, corrective actions, and close-out dates.
The log will include the date entered and the responsible party to correct the action. Most safety
issues will be resolved within the parameters of the RSC. Issues not resolved in the RSC, or
safety critical hazards, are referred to the SSRC.
RSC actions are similar to those listed under the BSC above. Additionally the RSC examines
compliance with General Code of Operating Rules (GCOR), (FRA 49 CFR Part 214, 49 CFR
200-399; FTA 49 CFR 659).

IV 1.2.6

Fire and Life Safety Committee (FLSC) (Projects Only)

The Fire and Life Safety and Committee serves as a liaison between project safety and local

/ (FAC)

Activation Committee (AC) / Rail (RAC) / Bus (BAC) / Facility

The Activation Committee is a working committee of managers that meets regularly, combining
safety and security verification process functions into RTD's construction, systems integration,
and testing phases of new rail projects. The RAC is made up of an activation manager (RAM) and
one manager from each of the following four supporting disciplines: Safety, Civil, Systems and
Operations.
RTD has instituted the use of the Activation Committee and the Hold Point process to bring on
new bus and facility projects. The membership of the committee may change slightly to best fit
the role of the RAC, BAC or FAC. The remainder of this section describes the Rail project
process, but is readily adaptable to a bus or facility project.
Each discipline manager will be responsible for ensuring all certified items lists (CILs),
procedures, tests, filing of documents, and any other assigned activities for his/her group are
completed in accordance with applicable parts of the rail activation plan (RAP). Three of the four
discipline managers, identified above, will each be assigned coordination responsibilities for one
of the three rail activation primary functions-safety and security certification, system integration
testing, and rail services. The RAC will oversee and approve all rail activation documents and
activities.
The RAM, with help from the RAC, will ensure that the project follows the rail activation
process, that all documents are properly completed and filed correctly, and that all necessary

1.C.4.a

The RAC will meet regularly to develop and finalize details of the RAP specific to the project,
and then manage rail activation activities against the plan. They will also discuss progress, issues,
and concerns in regard to activation activities and requirements. Meeting minutes will be
recorded and filed each time the committee meets. An action items list will be included with the
minutes, and will be updated and discussed each time the committee meets to ensure
responsibility and completion of items deemed critical to successful rail activation. The
committee will create, maintain, and adhere to a rail activation-specific schedule, which will help
to ensure completion of activation and start-up activities prior to scheduled revenue service dates.
Following commencement of revenue operations, the RAC provides "lessons learned" input to
planning and design teams, and for improved processes for the next activation.

IV 1.2.9

Safety and Security Working Group (SSWG)

The Safety and Security Working Group (SSWG) is established by the Project Manager (PM) for
each project that significantly changes the interaction of employees or patrons with the RTD
system. The SSWG examines the design and specifications of safety and security critical systems
on the project. The SSWG is chaired by the PM, project director, or a designee. Primary
responsibilities of the SSWG are to establish the preliminary hazard analysis, focus on and
mitigate hazards on the project, and coordinate the project safety elements through design,
construction and activation. The threat and vulnerability assessment (TVA), if conducted, is also
coordinated by the SSWG.
The SSWG begins during the design phase and conducts regular review meetings, separate from
ongoing design efforts, to focus specifically on safety issues. The project manager ensures that
safety considerations are continually considered during regular design reviews. Design
modifications that are recommended to be incorporated into the RTD design criteria are referred
to the Capital Development civil design manager for review at the design and construction
meeting (DCM). Modifications are then forwarded to the Configuration Control Committee
(CCC) for approval if the modifications are significant enough.

Intent – to review systems from an end-user perspective, looking for hazards that can be 1)
engineered out of the system, 2) corrected with SOP, procedures, etc. or 3) addressed with PPE.
The SSWG may not change the scope of the project, but may make decisions that relate directly
to the remediation of specific hazards. To this end, it is best for the SSWG to be included in the
scope phase of the project plan.
The SSWG defines the job specific CILS and creates and maintains the PHA. If the SSWG
determines that the residual risk of a hazard cannot be reduced below Medium, then the SSWG
presents its findings to the SSRC for final risk analysis.

Safety Assurance Practices
Employee Roles and Responsibilities

RTD employees and contractor personnel, whether construction or service contractors, are
required to be in compliance with applicable RTD rules and standard operating procedures (SOP)
as well as local, state, and federal safety regulations. Service contractors who perform specific
jobs under contract are required to be in compliance with specific safety or environmental laws
that are or may be affected by their work.
RTD has developed the RTD FasTracks Construction Safety Guidelines for Light Rail Transit
that governs contractor safety specifically for contracted construction workers for RTD. This
manual outlines procedures and responsibilities of RTD project managers and contractor
personnel who contract with RTD to perform construction work activities. Additionally, the RTD
safety goal is to achieve accident-free construction projects.
The RTD FasTracks Construction Safety Guidelines for Light Rail Transit reflect minimal
standards. All general contractors, contractors, and their sub-tiers will be expected to meet or
exceed the standards and good safe practices outlined in the manual and their own safety
program, whichever is more stringent.
The RTD grants and contract administrator will review and implement into contract language
requirements for the contract employees to meet. These contracts are written and reviewed by
RTD's Office of General Counsel and Safety and Environmental Divisions, as well as the contract
administrator to assure that specific safety and environmental requirements for contract
employees are met.

IV 2.3

Work-Required Training for Employees and Contractors

RTD is a public employer within the State of Colorado. As such, RTD is not subject to
enforcement under Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). However, it is the
District’s policy to voluntarily comply with OSHA regulations. To that end, the Safety Division
develops safety policies and procedures for occupational safety in compliance with OSHA
guidelines. Regular training sessions are conducted with affected employees based on job hazard
analysis. Annual refresher training is conducted for high hazard areas such as confined spaces and
lockout/tagout (LOTO). Safety staff conducts training. In addition to safety policies, the
environmental unit develops policies for environmental compliance. All RTD employees and
contractor personnel who foul or have the potential to foul the tracks (within 10' of centerline of
track), must receive the OTST prior to beginning their work. Contractors are responsible to train
their employees on OSHA-Required training prior to performing RTD projects. Other related
training that contract employees and RTD employees will be current on includes the following:
•
Hazard communication
•
Blood-borne pathogen awareness

Attachment: 2020 RTD TASP -Final - pdf 11-1-19 (3993 : 2020 Public Transit Agency Safety Plan)

controllers
These specific work positions, whether they are held by RTD employees or contractors
functioning for RTD Rail Services, may be regulated by 49 CFR 228. Other FRA regulatory
requirements, including the following, must be met by employees and contract personnel as it is
required by their function.
•
Maintaining and accessing employee and contractor training records
•
Compliance with training and certification requirements
Employees and contractors, who are under a legal contract with RTD, are obligated to comply
with specific safety and environmental requirements and demonstrate quality of workmanship by
observation and records reviews. Employees and/or contract employees will meet the training,
inspections, testing, and maintenance specifications as outlined in 49 CFR, as it relates to
commuter rail vehicle maintenance and personnel training. RTD supervisors, managers, and
transit safety specialists are authorized to make regular observations of work being performed,
and will determine whether or not safety and environmental requirements are being complied
with. The quality of materials and construction processes will also be reviewed by designated
quality assurance personnel. Training courses given to employees and contractors will require
that tests be completed prior to the completion of coursework. These will be the primary methods
used to assure that compliance is obtained.
RTD will identify the tasks related to the inspection, testing, and maintenance required by Part
238 that must be performed on each type of equipment that RTD LRV operates.

Contractor Safety Coordination and Construction Safety

Except for the RTD on-track safety training program required of contractors working on or near
RTD rail property, RTD does not train or certify contractors or employees of contractors. The
On-Track Safety Training (OTST) program is required of contractors prior to issuance of an
access permit to work near or on RTD rail property. The program is usually instructed in a trainthe-trainer format allowing contractors to train their own personnel. Compliance with this
program is verified through in-field observation and examination of contractor’s training cards.
The Safety and Environmental Division maintains a log of all contractors trained under the
program.
All contractor work on or near RTD rail property is controlled by access permits. Prior to issuing
an access permit, the contractor is required to meet with RTD staff to describe and coordinate
their work. After this initial coordination, the contractor applies for a permit which is reviewed
and approved by light rail maintenance-of-way, light rail transportation and safety prior to
signature issue by light rail control. The contractor is bound to the requirements of the permit. All
contractors contracted with RTD are also bound by contract specifications for the work they are
to perform.
The Safety and Environmental Division has developed two documents for the management of
construction safety; the Construction Safety Guidelines, and the Safety and Security Certification
Plan. The Construction Safety Guidelines presents the requirements for RTD construction
projects and follows the OSHA construction requirements and regulations. Contractors are
required to follow OSHA construction safety requirements and requirements of RTD contract
specifications and access permits.
RTD safety officers conduct construction safety oversight to monitor contractor work place safety
and conformance to OSHA standards. Oversight includes contractor safety orientation prior to
project commencement, field monitoring, and site safety inspections. Periodic safety meetings are
conducted between RTD and contractors to ensure safe project construction.
The Safety and Security Certification Plan describes the process for project and construction
verification. The Plan contains design and procurement specifications, field inspection
documentation, equipment testing requirements, and integrated testing procedures.

IV 2.5

Construction Safety Requirements

The construction safety program is developed and managed by RTD transit safety specialists.
This program defines construction safety functions and responsibilities and other construction
safety requirements such as safety equipment, documentation, and safety personnel. All
contractors and RTD employees must comply with Occupation Safety and Health Administration
(OSHA) rules and the requirements of the construction safety program, RTD Rail Services rule
books, SOPs, and individual company contract agreements with RTD.
Contractors who have personnel working around rail systems may be regulated by 49 CFR Part
214, the Roadway Worker Protection Act. Responsive to that requirement, RTD has established a

safety administrator– construction will also be the responsible party for participating in the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA Triennial Reviews 49 CFR 659.27) as they are conducted
each three-year cycle.

IV 2.6

Training and Certification Training, Courses, Education

The Safety Division maintains electronic training records for the following items: blood borne
pathogens, hazardous communications, lockout tag out, blue flag protection and forklift
certification. All safety related courses that are conducted in a classroom environment or through
computer based delivery are also maintained electronically by the Safety Division.
Records for the following training: Train operator certification, Train operator re-certification,
controller certification, controller re-certification, equipment certification, train license (N.S.T.),
lineman’s course, signal certification and basic/advanced track principles are maintained in the
employee training records, in paper form and are available for review. These records are available
directly from the rail department managers. The training supervisor and management review the
training records to determine completion. Most training is done annually, with all operators,
employees, and supervisors being trained in the same month.

IV 2.6.1

Transit safety specialists Certification

The Safety Department recognizes the FTA Transportation Safety Institute (TSI) to administer
Transit Safety and Security Program (TSSP) certification for all transit safety specialists at RTD.
All transit safety specialists will complete the TSSP within the first two years of their safety
assignment. This certification involves the successful completion of the Transit Safety and
Security Program Certificate as outlined by TSI training manual. Courses required are:
 Transit Rail/Bus System Safety
 Transit Rail/Bus Incident Investigation

Federal Railroad Administration and Commuter Rail

It is the intent of this Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan to meet all of the applicable FRA
requirements for commuter rail as well as to address the Light Rail system. This plan will not
identify all of the specific requirements of 49 CFR; however, it will identify the parts that will be
regulated by the FRA. Specific standard operating procedures (SOP) will be developed in each of
the operating areas of maintenance and operations, with the exception of waivers that have been
approved by the FRA for the operation of the Commuter Rail system. These procedures will
identify the inspection, testing, and maintenance of numerous tasks. The following is a list of
Code of Federal Railroad Administration Regulations (49 CFR) relating to commuter rail
operating equipment on standard gage rail that operates on or is connected to the general railroad
system. This list is taken from the Manual for the Development of System Safety Program Plans
for Commuter Railroads published May 15, 2006 by APTA.

Construction Safety

Construction safety is administered in accordance with contract specifications, and applicable
Federal, State and local safety requirements. The RTD System Safety Engineer has primary
responsibility for safety oversight of construction projects. The program is based on, and
complies with applicable federal, state, and local safety codes and regulations. Procedures have
been established for the control of operating hazards, including but not limited to chemicals,
noise, cut and abrasion injuries, strain, and sprain injuries. Contractors are required to comply
with these requirements for the safety of their own employees as well as to safeguard RTD
employees, contractors, passengers and the public.
Engineering and Project Management approves the contractor's safety program plan and
supporting documentation, with the concurrence of the Safety Division. Particular emphasis is
placed on work that may affect RTD operations, passengers, facilities, and personnel. All
contractors working in the RTD rail rights of way, or interfacing with RTD Rail Operations are
required to attend OTST. This training covers track access, right of way flagging, and operating
procedures. Reviews of the contractors are conducted to assure compliance with Federal and State
Law, and the RTD requirements.

IV 3.3.1

Employee and Contractor Awareness of FRA
Requirements

RTD employees and contractors are required to be aware of and comply with specific FRA
regulations. A specific requirement of Roadway Worker Protection (RWP) (49CFR214) is a
safety requirement that employees and contractors must follow. Employees and contractors who
may foul the tracks or have potential to foul the tracks while performing their work are required
to receive specific Roadway Worker Protection training before they perform roadway work. The
rail control centers have established a Work Permit which must be completed and submitted for
approval prior to working on the tracks. Contractors and employees must receive RWP training
and verify competency through testing. Track Access Coordinator reviews and verifies training
requirements prior to approving work permits. Safety personnel and Rail Supervisory personnel
may remove an employee or contractor from a worksite if he/she demonstrates a lack of
knowledge and understanding of applicable RWP rules and procedures. Contracts require
compliance with specific OSHA regulations and employee safety programs as applicable to the

Specific RTD employees must comply with Hours of Service requirements set forth by the FRA
while in the performance of specific job duties. Currently Train Operators, Operations
Supervisor/Controllers and Line and Signal Technicians must comply with Hours of Service
requirements.

IV 3.3.2

Personal Protective Equipment

Appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as safety glasses, safety boots, gloves,
face shields and work uniforms, etc. is required to be used in performing various work by RTD
personnel. This equipment should be evaluated and approved by the safety department prior to
procurement.

contractor worksites to assess contractor employee knowledge of and compliance with regulatory
and contract requirements. Deficiencies are brought to the attention of contractor project
managers for corrective action.

Date: November 6, 2019

GM

Date:

November 6, 2019

Board Meeting Date: November 12, 2019

Subject:

Revised On-Vehicle and Digital Advertising
Approach

INFORMATION
The Communications Department would like to proceed with an enhanced approach to system
advertising. Currently, RTD contracts with a vendor, Lamar Advertising of Denver (Lamar) to facilitate
on-vehicle advertising on behalf of the agency. The vendor sells advertising and coordinates ad
production and installation on RTD buses and trains. RTD receives a Minimum Annual Guarantee (MAG),
which is currently $3.4 million per year, or 60 percent of net sales, whichever is greater.
Currently, the advertising program includes only static on-board advertising, no digital advertising
capabilities. Recent innovations in advertising allow RTD to leverage emerging technology to improve the
distribution of customer information and enhance the overall customer experience. Digital advertising
also expands the potential to increase the revenues generated through system advertising.
The expanded approach to system advertising would combine the current on-vehicle advertising program
with a digital advertising program for a more comprehensive and holistic advertising program.
Goals
The revised approach to system advertising centers around three primary goals:
1. Enhance the customer experience by upgrading current static map cases at rail stations to digital
customer information displays, allowing convenient management and flexibility in sharing customer
information.
2. Reduce costs by securing free and guaranteed agency advertising space and reducing
print/production costs of agency ads.
3. Increase revenues by maximizing advertising across the agency’s vast capital assets including the
bus and rail fleet, rail and bus rapid transit stations, parking facilities, building facilities; and
migrating to digital advertising on the rail system.
BACKGROUND
On October 28, 2014, RTD awarded Lamar a three-year On-Vehicle Advertising Contract with a twoyear option for 2018 and 2019. RTD exercised the two-year option in 2017, to extend the agreement to
the end of 2019.
In an effort to begin digital advertising on RTD’s system, the agency issued an RFP for Digital
Advertising in December of 2018 and received two proposals. Following a thorough evaluation of both

Packet Pg. 185

1.C.5

proposals and taking into consideration the numerous questions and concerns received during the
procurement, RTD decided to cancel the solicitation for Digital Advertising and develop a more robust
and financially lucrative system advertising approach. This approach would combine the On-Vehicle
Advertising Program with a Digital Public Information and Advertising Program into one larger
comprehensive program. Staff would revise the advertising RFP to include on-vehicle advertising and
digital public information and advertising as a way to enhance the delivery of customer information and
optimize advertising revenues through RTD’s assets. This would require a one-year extension of the
current Lamar contract to continue the advertising program while staff conducts the new procurement
and contract award process.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
An expanded approach to system advertising provides RTD with an opportunity to optimize the revenue
the agency generates from advertising across its system and facilities.
NEXT STEPS
Staff plans to return to the Board in December 2019 at the Communications and Government Relations
Committee with a request to extend the current On-Vehicle Advertising Contract with Lamar Advertising
for one year from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020. During this time, staff will prepare a
more comprehensive advertising RFP and proceed with a procurement process for a new system
advertising contract.
Staff will also present the Board with a revised System Advertising Policy that reflects emerging
advertising trends, addresses new products and technologies, and aligns with agency progress.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approves the attached Resolution No. ______ reappointing Bill Van Meter and Derrick Black to a term
expiring 12/31/2021 as trustees for the Salaried Employee Defined Benefit (i.e., Pension) Plan and
Salaried Employee Defined Contribution Plan.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management
Task Goal #2 – Address Service & Human Capital
Task Goal #3 – Ensure Fiscal Sustainability
BACKGROUND
On January 8, 2008, the RTD Board of Directors adopted Resolution No. 1 Series of 2008 providing that
a screening committee composed of the Board Chair, the Chair of the Salaried Employee Pension Trust
Fund and the Finance Chair (i.e., Chair of the Finance Administration and Audit Committee) will screen
applications from the middle management salaried employee class and the senior management salaried
employee class and will bring recommendations back to the Board.
In 2010, Resolution No. 27 made modification to state that, “for reappointment of Trustees who have
served satisfactorily and in whose education the Trusts have made substantial investments, it is not
necessary to seek applications for renewal, and instead the application process established by the RTD
Board of Directors in 2008 will be used on those occasions when the Board finds it necessary or
appropriate to appoint new salaried trustees to the Trusts.”
On May 31, 2016, in Resolution No. 008 Series of 2016, the RTD Board of Directors amended the
Pension Trust and the Defined Contribution Trust, to end the “senior” and “middle” management
distinction, and instead authorized the Board of Directors to appoint two employee Trustees who
participate in the Pension Plan and two who participate in the Defined Contribution Plan, in addition to
the two Board members who are appointed to the Trusts and the Chief Financial Officer who is a
permanent member of the Trusts, to serve as the same set of trustees on both of the Trusts.
Bill Van Meter and Derrick Black current terms expire on 12/31/2019. Both Bill and Derrick meet the
criteria from Resolution No. 2017, Series 2010 for reappointment.

2. Reject the Recommended Action and the attached resolution, and require the screening
committee to return with a revised recommendation. This is not recommended since the
committee has reviewed applicants and performed its function in accordance with the Plan
requirements, consistent with the goals of existing Board resolutions.

Adoption of the 2020 Performance Measures

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: November 6, 2019
&

GM
Board Meeting Date:

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the Board of Directors adopts
the attached 2020 Proposed Performance Report and the accompanying performance measures for
mission statement goals 1-7. In 2020, there are 42 proposed performance measures to be tracked for
the GM, which is one higher than for 2019.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Service
BACKGROUND
Each year the RTD Board of Directors adopts a vision and mission statement, goals, objectives, and
specific performance measures. These performance measures provide a framework in which RTD can
determine how well it provides service to its passengers and the citizens of the District within the
context of its mission statement, and they should integrate with the Board’s priorities for the coming
year.
A report detailing year-to-date performance on each of these measures is presented to the Board of
Directors following the end of each quarter. The proposed performance measures for 2020 are brought
to the Board of Directors for review at this time because the measures are used in development of the
2020 Budget. These final 2020 performance measures are being presented to the Board at the
November 12th Financial Administration and Audit Committee meeting with a request to forward to the
Board for adoption on November 19th.
DISCUSSION
Recommended changes in the performance measures from 2019 to 2020 are listed below:


Goal 1.4 Reduce the number of light rail accidents
o It is recommended that the measure be changed from reporting preventable light rail
accidents per 100,000 train miles to reporting the actual number of preventable accidents
regardless of miles and that the measure be changed from ≤ 2.0 to ≤ 3.0 in 2020.



Goal 1.5 Reduce the number of commuter rail accidents
o It is recommended that the measure be changed from reporting preventable commuter rail
accidents per 100,000 train miles to reporting the actual number of preventable accidents
regardless of miles and that the measure be changed from ≤ 2.0 to ≤ 3.0 in 2020.



Goal 6.2 Increase in ridership
o It is recommended that the ridership increase for 2020 be established at 2.1% based on
estimates for ridership for 2019 and 2020. Overall system ridership is projected to be flat

Packet Pg. 198

2.B.2

for the Base System with any ridership increases attributed to FasTracks. Full-year G Line
and SERE numbers are factored in as well as mid-year opening of the N line. The measure
includes all passenger boardings not limited to revenue ridership; ridership estimates for
the Mall Shuttle and Free MetroRide are included.


Goal 6.3 Increase in fare revenue and total operating revenue
o It is recommended that the fare revenue increase for 2020 be established at 2.6%. This is
the percentage increase in estimated fare revenue over the 2019 projection. It is based on
ridership estimates and assumes full-year ridership for the G Line and SERE and half-year
ridership for the N Line.
o It is recommended that the total operating revenue increase for 2020 be established at
2.4%. This is the percentage increase in total operating revenue in the 2020 Budget over
the 2019 projection.



Goal 6.5 Maintain bus/light rail operator headcount and bus mechanic headcount within
authorization.
o A change is proposed to add the measurement of Light Rail operator vacancies at ≤ 5.0%
and light rail operators over headcount at ≤ 4.0%. This mirrors the same measure for bus
operators. It is deemed relevant due to system growth and the need to monitor operator
hiring in current labor markets.

With the addition of the measurement for light rail operator vacancies/headcount, there will be 42
proposed performance measures to be tracked for the GM which is one higher than for 2019.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The 2020 performance measures are being utilized in the development of the final 2020 Adopted
Budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors adopts the attached 2020 Proposed Performance Report and the performance measures
included for mission statement goals 1-7. In 2020, there are 42 proposed performance measures
to be tracked for the GM.
2. Do not adopt the 2020 Proposed Performance Report and the accompanying performance
measures. This is not the recommended action because it results in no measures for ridership,
fare revenue, and total operating revenue and does not aid in the development of the 2020
budget.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

From:

Heather McKillop,
Administration

Date:

November 6, 2019

Subject:

Adoption of the Investment Policy

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: November 6, 2019
&

GM
Board Meeting Date:

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
adopt the attached Investment Policy which contains recommended changes to reflect changes in state
law relating to bank securities and some wording changes for clarification purposes.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management, Task Goal #3 – Ensure Fiscal Sustainability
BACKGROUND
The Policy specifies the practices and procedures that pertain to the investment of RTD’s operating and
reserve funds. The Board last approved modifications to the Policy in November 2018. Section 10 of
the Policy states “The CFO shall conduct a review of the Policy on an annual basis and present the
policy, denoting any changes, to the Board of Directors for approval.”
DISCUSSION
Staff solicited the expertise, knowledge and recommendations of its investment advisor, Public Trust
Advisors, in reviewing the current Policy. Recommended changes are in response to a change in state
law in 2019 and clarification to some previously existing text in the policy.
The purpose of the Investment Policy (the “Policy”) of the Regional Transportation District ("RTD") is to
specify the policies and procedures that support a prudent and systematic program for investments in
RTD’s operating and reserve funds. The Policy also provides for the investment of bond proceeds that
are authorized through bond resolutions or indentures of trust.
By following best practices with respect to the management of public funds, the primary objectives of
RTD’s Investment Policy in order of priority are: 1) safety of principal, 2) sufficient liquidity to meet
known cash flow requirements, and 3) yield (achieving a market rate of return). Although RTD must
legally follow the investment parameters dictated by Colorado Revised Statutes (C.R.S. 24-75-601.1) it
has previously made a policy decision to implement its investment program in a more conservative
manner than is dictated by state statute through imposing stricter diversification requirements.
A redlined copy of the recommended policy is attached which highlights the recommended changes from
the currently adopted investment policy.

Regional Transportation District
Investment Policy Statement

The purpose of this document is to specify the policies and procedures that support a prudent and
systematic program for investment transactions involving operating and reserve funds of the
Regional Transportation District ("RTD").
2. SCOPE
This investment policy ("Policy") applies to investment of all operating and reserve funds of the
RTD (collectively, the “Portfolio").
This Policy shall not restrict the ability of RTD to invest proceeds from the issuance of RTD
securities in financial obligations permitted through board-approved bond resolutions or
indentures of trust pursuant to which the securities were issued. The standards of care dictated
for investments of other RTD funds shall also pertain to the investment of such proceeds.
3. OBJECTIVES
The objectives, in priority order, of the RTD's investment activities shall be:
3.1 Safety
Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the investment program. Investments of RTD
will be made in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the Portfolio. To
attain this objective, RTD will endeavor to mitigate credit and interest rate risks.
Credit Risk: RTD will minimize credit risk, which is the risk of loss due to the failure of the
security issuer or backer, by:



Limiting investments to the types of securities listed in the Authorized Investments
section of this Policy.
Diversifying the Portfolio in accordance with Policy limits in order to minimize the
potential for losses from any one type of security or any one individual issuer.

Interest Rate Risk: RTD will minimize interest rate risk, which is the risk that the market
value of securities in the Portfolio will fall due to changes in market interest rates, by:


Attachment: Recommended Investment Policy 10-31-19 (3995 : Adoption of the Investment Policy)

1. PURPOSE

Maintaining Portfolio duration appropriate to the cash flow requirements of RTD,
thereby reducing the likelihood that securities would need to be sold on the open
market prior to maturity.

1
Packet Pg. 215

2.B.3.a

3.2 Liquidity

3.3 Yield
The Portfolio shall be designed with the objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout
budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account the investment risk constraints, liquidity
needs, and cash flow characteristics of the Portfolio.
4. STANDARDS OF CARE
4.1 Prudence
All RTD officers and employees involved in the investment of RTD funds, along with any
external investment advisors, shall adhere to the guidance provided by the “prudent investor”
standard to insure that:
“When investing, reinvesting, purchasing, acquiring, exchanging, selling, or managing
public funds, a trustee shall act with care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the
circumstances then prevailing, including, but not limited to, the general economic
conditions and the anticipated needs of the agency, that a prudent person acting in a like
capacity and familiar with those matters would use in the conduct of funds of a like
character and with like aims, to safeguard the principal and maintain the liquidity needs
of the agency. Within the limitations of this section and considering individual
investments as part of an overall strategy, investments may be acquired as authorized by
law."
RTD shall recognize that no investment is totally riskless and that the investment activities of
RTD are a matter of public record. Accordingly, it recognizes that occasional measured losses
are inevitable in a diversified portfolio and shall be considered within the context of the overall
Portfolio’s return, provided that adequate diversification has been implemented, and that the sale
of a security is in the best long-term interest of RTD.
Authorized investment personnel acting in accordance with this Policy and exercising due
diligence shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security’s credit risk or
market price changes, provided that deviations from expectation are reported in a timely fashion
and appropriate action is taken to control adverse developments.

Attachment: Recommended Investment Policy 10-31-19 (3995 : Adoption of the Investment Policy)

The Portfolio will remain sufficiently liquid to enable RTD to meet all cash flow requirements
which might be reasonably anticipated. This will be achieved through maturity diversification
and purchases of securities that have an established secondary market.

4.2 Delegation of Authority
RTD is granted legislative authority to invest its funds pursuant to Colorado Revised Statutes,
Section 32-9-119. Management responsibility for the investment program is hereby delegated to

2
Packet Pg. 216

2.B.3.a

RTD may, in its discretion, contract with one or more investment advisers, registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, to manage a
portion of its Portfolio assets. Any such advisor shall comply with this Policy and such other
written instructions as provided by RTD.
While it is understood that the procedures and trading counterparties of a contracted investment
adviser may differ from those of RTD, contracted investment advisers must maintain internal
controls and compliance systems at least as extensive as those of the RTD in order to assure
adequate protection of RTD assets in keeping with the standards of prudence outlined below.
4.3 Investment Procedures
The CFO shall establish written procedures for the operation of the investment program,
consistent with this Policy, which shall include explicit delegation of authority to persons
responsible for investment transactions. No person may engage in an investment transaction
except as provided under the terms of this Policy and the internal procedures established by the
CFO. Persons who are authorized to transact investment business and wire funds on behalf of
RTD are listed in Appendix 1 to this policy.
4.4 Internal Controls
The CFO shall establish a system of internal controls, which shall be reviewed annually. The
controls shall be designed to prevent loss of funds due to fraud, employee error,
misrepresentation by third parties, or imprudent actions by employees of RTD.
4.5 Ethics and Conflicts of Interest
Investment activities shall be performed in accordance with RTD’s Code of Ethics and other
policies of RTD. Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from
personal business activity that could conflict with the proper execution of the investment
program, or which could impair their ability to make impartial investment decisions. Employees
and investment officials shall disclose to the General Manager any material financial interests in
financial institutions that conduct business with RTD, and they shall further disclose any large
personal/financial/investment positions that could be related to the performance of the Portfolio.
Employees and officers shall subordinate their personal investment transactions to those of RTD
particularly with regard to the timing of purchases or sales.
5. AUTHORIZED INVESTMENTS

the General Manager and his designees. The General Manager’s designee will hereinafter be
referred to as the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”).

Authorized investments for RTD funds are specifically listed below. RTD recognizes that
investment risk can result from issuer defaults, market price changes or various technical
impediments leading to diminished liquidity or loss of capital. Portfolio risk management and
diversification are employed as a way to minimize the risks inherent in investing.

highest rating category (“AA”) includes bonds rated AA+, AA and AA- for Standard & Poor's
and Fitch, and Aa1, Aa2 and Aa3 for Moody's Investors Service. In the event that an issuer or
security is downgraded below the minimum rating level for any specific security that is held in
the Portfolio, the CFO will review the exposure of that security holding and will determine if it is
advisable to sell such holding.

2.B.3.a

6. INVESTMENT PARAMETERS

RTD does not make investments for the purpose of trading or speculation, but, rather, with the
prevalent intent to hold securities to maturity. The prohibition of speculative investment
precludes pursuit of profit through unusual risk or conjectural fluctuations in market prices.
However, fluctuations in market rates or changes in credit quality may produce situations where
securities may be sold at a nominal loss in order to mitigate further erosion of principal or to
reinvest proceeds of sale in securities that will out-perform the original investment.
6.2 Competitive Bidding
A record shall be maintained of all bids and offers for securities transactions to support RTD’s
competitive pricing process. Relative offerings shall not be required in the purchase of
obligations at their initial auction or offering. Typically, awards will be made to the bidder
offering the highest effective yield consistent with the Policy: however, transaction costs,
diversification requirements, extraordinary events and other factors may be considered when
awarding investments. RTD shall obtain competitive bid or offer information on all purchases or
sales of investment instruments on the secondary market. A competitive bid or offer can be
executed through a bidding process involving at least three separate brokers/financial
institutions. If RTD is offered a security for which there is no readily available competitive
offering on the same specific issue, the investment officer may document quotations for
comparable or alternative securities. When purchasing original/new issue securities, no
competitive offerings will be required as all dealers in the selling group offer those securities at
the same original issue price.
6.3 Portfolio Duration
The maturity of the securities in the Portfolio shall be managed with respect to the cash flow
needs of RTD and the Portfolio shall be managed to maintain a duration of three years or less.
6.4 Authorized Financial Dealers and Institutions
RTD or an investment advisor hired by RTD will maintain a list of financial institutions
authorized to provide investment services and it shall be the policy of RTD to purchase securities
only from those authorized institutions and firms. Trading counterparties shall be limited to (i)
primary dealers reporting to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, or (ii) broker/dealers that
qualify under Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15c3-1 (uniform net capital rule).
6.5 Authorized Investment Advisors

Attachment: Recommended Investment Policy 10-31-19 (3995 : Adoption of the Investment Policy)

6.1 Sale of Securities

RTD may engage the services of one or more professional investment advisory firms to assist in
the management of the Portfolio. Such investment advisors may be granted discretion to
purchase and sell investment securities in accordance with this Policy and may utilize their own
approved list of broker/dealers. Such firms must be authorized to conduct business in the State

Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

2.B.3.a

7. SAFEKEEPING AND CUSTODY

With the exception of collateral under repurchase agreements (discussed below), all investment
securities purchased shall be held in a safekeeping account or trust custody account at a
designated third party custodian. For safekeeping accounts, the institution shall issue a
safekeeping receipt for each security, listing the specific instrument, par value, rate, CUSIP and
any other pertinent information. In addition, the safekeeping or trust custody institutions shall
provide a statement on at least a monthly basis listing all securities held in account, including
book value and market value of holdings at month-end.
For collateral (purchased securities) under repurchase agreements, RTD may utilize tri-party
repurchase agreements with an acceptable third-party custodian provided that RTD is satisfied
that it has perfected interest in the securities used as collateral, and that RTD has a properly
executed tri-party agreement.
7.2 Delivery vs. Payment
All investment transactions will be executed on a delivery versus payment basis.
8. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
Investment reports shall be prepared on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis. Transaction
summaries shall be maintained and available in the office of the CFO or other authorized
investment personnel. Quarterly investment reports shall be submitted to the Board of Directors
and shall outline RTD’s total investment return and compare the Portfolio’s performance to a
publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics.
Within 120 days of the end of RTD’s fiscal year, a comprehensive report on RTD’s investment
program and investment activity shall be prepared for the Board of Directors. The annual report
shall include quarterly comparisons of investment return and may suggest improvements that
might be made in the investment program. Such annual report shall include any other item of
significance which may enhance the understanding of the investment program. Each investment
advisor shall submit like reports in a timely manner based on the respective terms of each
contract and agreement
All securities holdings reports for RTD shall disclose the maximum maturity liability to RTD
(the stated maturity) as well as the first call date of each callable security held.
9. PERFORMANCE STANDARDS

Attachment: Recommended Investment Policy 10-31-19 (3995 : Adoption of the Investment Policy)

7.1 Safekeeping and custody

RTD's Portfolio is managed with the objective of obtaining a market rate of return,
commensurate with identified risk constraints and cash flow characteristics. Because the
composition of the Portfolio fluctuates, depending on market and credit conditions, various
indices may be used to monitor investment performance.
10
Packet Pg. 224

2.B.3.a

RTD recognizes that bond proceeds must be invested in accordance with Section 1.148 of the
U.S. Internal Revenue Code, related to arbitrage rebate, which limits the investment returns
which may be achieved or retained by RTD on such proceeds investments. For purposes of this
Policy “bond proceeds” shall mean proceeds from the issuance of bonds, certificates of
participation or other financial securities issued by RTD.
10. INVESTMENT POLICY REVIEW AND APPROVAL
The CFO shall conduct a review of the Policy on an annual basis and present the Policy,
denoting any changes, to the Board of Directors for approval.

Attachment: Recommended Investment Policy 10-31-19 (3995 : Adoption of the Investment Policy)

The current board-approved index for the liquidity tier of the Portfolio (cash and cash
equivalents) is the 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index as published by Bank of America Merrill
Lynch. For the enhanced cash portion of the Portfolio (securities maturing between 90 days and
5 years and with a target duration of 1 year), the designated performance benchmark is the
Merrill Lynch 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
adopt a 2020 contribution of $6.1 million to RTD’s Salaried Employees’ Defined Benefit Pension Trust
(the “DB Plan”), which pays a specified monthly benefit at retirement. It is also recommended that the
RTD Board of Directors adopt a 2020 contribution of 9% of each participant’s eligible compensation to
the Salaried Employees’ Defined Contribution Plan (the “DC Plan”), which contributes a specified amount
to the plan for each year of employment.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Task Goal #2 – Address Service & Human Capital
BACKGROUND
In December, 2007, the RTD Board of Directors closed the DB Plan to new employees with new
employees hired on January 1, 2008 and later participating in the DC Plan. From January 1, 2008 to
December 31, 2012 both the DB and DC Plan had been funded on a 9% of salaries basis.
DISCUSSION

DB Plan
In 2012, the Board of Directors agreed that beginning in 2013, annual contributions to the DB Plan
would be made at a fixed annual amount of $3.1 million rather than as a percentage of salaries as a
result of the actuary’s recommendation at that time. The fixed annual contribution of $3.1 million to the
DB Plan was determined by the plan’s actuaries to be the annual contribution necessary to maintain a
“fully funded” status for the plan in the future. In 2016, the policy was changed to fund an amount that
would keep the Plan “actuarially sound” based on the recommendations of the Actuary and RTD’s Chief
Financial Officer.
The Actuary has updated the DB Plan projections to reflect the final 1/1/2019 valuation assumptions for
the DB Plan. The 2020 Actuary recommended contribution is $8.1 million.
If the Actuarial
recommendation of $8.1 million is made beginning in 2020, the plan is expected to achieve 100%
funding in 2031 and the recommended amount is projected to drop below $5.1 million in 2032.
RTD’s Chief Financial Officer is recommending a contribution of $6.1 million. If RTD contributed $6.1
million in 2020 and beyond, the Plan is expected to achieve 100% funding in 2040. This also assumes
an annual rate of return of 7% per year.

Packet Pg. 229

2.B.4

DC Plan
Section 4.1 of the RTD Salaried Employees’ DC Plan adopted by the RTD Board provides that the
Employer may, at its sole discretion, set a contribution rate between 7 to 9% per year for participants.
The contribution rate has been 9% each year to the DC Plan from 2008 through 2019.

Plan”), which contributes a specified amount to the plan for each year of employment.
2. The RTD Board of Directors could certify an amount to be contributed to the RTD Salaried
Employees’ Defined Benefit Pension Trust or the RTD Salaried Employees’ Defined Contribution
Plan at amounts other than $6.1 million and 9%, respectively.
3. Do not authorize a contribution to the RTD Salaried Employees’ Pension Plans. This is not
recommended because the DB Plan’s funding status would deteriorate and the liability would
increase.

Date:

Subject:

Board Expense Reduction Resolution

Executive

Manager,

GM
Board Meeting Date:

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Executive Committee of the RTD Board of Directors that the Board approve a
motion to adopt the attached Resolution No. ______, Series of 2019, concerning a Temporary Reduction
of Certain Board Office Budget Lines Related to Director Travel and the Allocation of Certain Meeting
Expenses to Directors’ Local Expense Budgets.
This recommendation is consistent with the General Manager’s 2019 Core Goal #3 - Strong Financial
Management.
BACKGROUND
Directors are eligible for reimbursement from the District for reasonable local and travel expenses
incurred that are necessary to the transaction of official District business. Out-of-District registration
fees for the first two sanctioned events for each Director are not charged against the Director’s
expenses and are instead paid for using Board Office funds.
In 2009 and again in 2011, the Board unanimously adopted resolutions reducing the Board members’
spending limits on their local and travel expenses as economic downturns required a reduction in overall
agency spending.
DISCUSSION
The attached resolution, for Fiscal Year 2020 only:




Reduces by $2,000 the amount allocated to each Directors’ travel expense budget;
Reduces by half, or $12,750, the amount budgeted by the Board Office to defray the cost of
Directors’ registration fees incurred in order to attend out-of-District transit-related conferences;
and
Authorizes the Board Office to allocate a debit in a certain amount toward each Director’s local
expense account for expenses incurred by the Board Office on behalf of the Director in the course
of preparing for official meetings of the Board and its committees.

ALTERNATIVES
1. To adopt the attached resolution.
2. To reject the resolution. Rejection of this resolution would necessitate further cuts to certain line
items in the Board Office budget in order to balance the Board Office’s component of the 2020
requested agency budget.

Packet Pg. 232

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Adoption of this resolution would result in an estimated General Fund savings of at least $51,000 during
Fiscal Year 2020.

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT

Temporary Reduction of Certain Board Office Budget Lines Related to Director Travel and
Allocation of Certain Meeting Expenses to Directors’ Local Expense Budgets
WHEREAS, The Regional Transportation District (RTD) has 15 elected Board members who
serve their constituents on a daily basis throughout the community, at committee meetings,
study sessions, and Board meetings, and at the legislature, and
WHEREAS, there is an increasing need and desire of the community to hear of RTD’s
evolving plans and projects; and
WHEREAS, Board members’ direct contact with constituents puts a public face on RTD and
gives community members the opportunity to share ideas and concerns with their elected
officials; and
WHEREAS, in order to learn current information and keep updated on a myriad of
transportation issues and new innovations across the nation, it is important for Directors to
experience first-hand other transit agencies and issues they face; and
WHEREAS, in order to grasp new ever-changing transit technology, it is important for the
Directors to attend conferences and formal presentations and meet with peers from other
transit agencies to discuss issues similar to those experienced by RTD; and
WHEREAS, in recognition of the effect of the economic downturn in the Denver metropolitan
region, however, and the concomitant reduction in sales and use tax revenues, the Board
believes it appropriate to reduce the local expense limits allocated to the RTD Board
members;
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that for Fiscal Year 2020 only:
1) The amount allocated to each Director’s travel expense budget shall be reduced by
$2,000;
2) The amount budgeted by the Board Office to defray the cost of Directors’ registration
fees incurred in order to attend out-of-District transit-related conferences shall be
reduced by half; and
3) That the Board Office is authorized to allocate a debit in a certain amount toward
each Director’s local expense account for expenses incurred by the Board Office on

Draft 2020 Budget

Information

CFO/AGM,

Date: November 6, 2019

GM

BACKGROUND
RTD’s initial 2020 Requested Budget was presented at the Financial Administration and Audit
Committee (FAAC) on September 17, 2019. The State of Colorado requires that a requested budget be
presented to the Board and be made available for public inspection after giving public notice in
newspapers of major distribution by October 15th of each year. Public notice was given in the October
12-13, 2019 weekend editions of The Denver Post and The Boulder Daily Camera. Copies of the
preliminary 2020 budget were made available at that time in the Board office for public inspection and
the preliminary budget was posted on the website. A budget update was presented to FAAC on
October 22, 2019.
The purpose of this Board report is to update the Board with proposed changes and new information that
has become available since the presentation of the first draft 2020 Requested Budget and subsequent
update at the FAAC. The 2020 Recommended Budget (final budget) is now scheduled to be presented
at the December 10th FAAC meeting with a request to forward the budget to the Board for adoption on
December 17th.
DISCUSSION
The following summarizes revised assumptions incorporated into the 2020 budget from those previously
presented at the FAAC. Major revisions and areas of focus include:


Sales/use taxes are revised from the first draft Requested Budget previously presented to
the Board on September 17th. The first draft budget incorporated the CU-Leeds School
March sales/use tax forecast, while subsequent budget updates incorporate the September
forecast as will the final Recommended Budget. In the CU-Leeds School September
forecast, 2020 sales/use tax is revised downward to increase 2.0% over the 2019
projection, which is also revised downward to increase 2.7% over 2018. The most
current sales/use tax forecast is lower by $25.2 million in 2020 compared to the Mid-term
Financial Plan (MTFP).



Revised estimates for fare revenue have been made based on year-to-date actual data
through September and a forecast for North Metro based on a May 2020 opening. Fare
revenue is now estimated to be lower by $14.8 million in 2020 compared to the MTFP.
This number improved from the previous estimated shortfall of $17.1 million.

Packet Pg. 250

2.C.2



The total of 2020 fare revenue and sales/use tax revenue shortfalls from the MTFP is
$40.0 million. This number improved from the previous estimated shortfall of $42.3
million.



Staff has made a series of reductions in planned expenditures from the first draft
Requested Budget and subsequent update previously presented at FAAC. Reductions
were made by all departments to meet the operating expense target established in the
MTFP and to make up for the estimated shortfalls from the MTFP in sales/use tax revenue
and fare revenue. The goal is a balanced 2020 Recommended Budget to be presented to
the Board on December 10th.



Base System measures planned to balance the final budget are as follows:



The items highlighted in yellow are changed from the previous update on October 22 and
consist of the following:

Packet Pg. 251

2.C.2

o

Additional requests over the MTFP have been reduced from $4.1 million to $1.7
million. These are necessary expenses related to insurance and mobile ticketing
support identified after the MTFP was finalized.

o

Staff was informed about the State Audit in 2020 after the MTFP was finalized.

o

Grant revenue was revised after the MTFP was finalized to include grant-funded
projects and revisions to earlier forecasts based on updated information.

o

Purchase of the UP Burnham Yard property adjacent to the RTD ROW to be utilized
for additional trackage along the Central Corridor is postponed until 2022 at the
direction of the City & County of Denver.



An executed diesel fuel lock for 2020 will have positive benefit. Diesel fuel is budgeted at
a locked price of $2.00/gallon for 2020, down from the budgeted price of $2.30/gallon.
The favorable impact from the 2020 price lock is $3.0 million. Gasoline remains budgeted
at $2.90/gallon, same as the 2019 budgeted price.



Based on the above calculation, the 2020 Budget for the Base System would be balanced.
Should any of the items identified to close the gap not materialize before the 2020 budget
is finalized, additional measures will be taken to eliminate a Base System gap which may
include further operating expense reductions, capital expenditure reductions, or fund
draws.



The total capital carryforward (previously approved capital) is not estimated at this time
but will be included in the final Recommended Budget.



The FasTracks budget is able to withstand its share of the revenue shortfall to MTFP and
maintain a balanced budget in 2020.



In FasTracks Project and FasTracks Operations, the Board-Appropriated Fund, Capital
Replacement Fund, and Unrestricted Fund are established at 3 months of operating
expenses.



The Base System Unrestricted Fund balance is targeted at $2.0 million, which is the
projected fund balance in the MTFP. This target remains a viable goal after adjusting for
the above-noted revenue items and expense reductions. The Base System will not meet
the goal of 3 months of operating expenses in fund balances in 2020 but is estimated to
have approximately 1 month of operating expenses in fund balances in 2020.
The $3.0 million contribution to the Board-Appropriated Fund is retained for 2020.

POLICY REFERENCE
Investment Policy
DISCUSSION
Please find the District’s investment report for the third quarter of 2019 attached. RTD funds are
invested in high quality, short term investments which are often effected by changing economic
conditions and expectations and also by actions of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee.
The U.S. economy and household spending continued to expand at a moderate pace during the third
quarter of 2019 while business fixed investment and exports have weakened. The U.S. unemployment
rate decreased to 3.5% and general inflationary pressures have been muted.
In view of implications of global developments for the economic outlook, the Federal Reserve Open
Market Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 1.50 to 1.75 percent.
The District’s Investment Policy (the “Policy”) is conservative in nature and seeks to satisfy the three
primary objectives of: safety, liquidity and yield, in that order of importance.
The Policy specifies that:
“Quarterly reports shall outline the District’s total investment return and compare the portfolio’s
performance to a publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics
to the portfolio or sub-portfolio being measured. For the liquidity tier of the portfolio (cash and cash
equivalents), the specified index shall be the 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index as published by Bank of
America Merrill Lynch for the period being measured. For the enhanced cash portion of the portfolio
(securities maturing between 90 days and 5 years and with a target duration of 1 year), the designated
performance benchmark will be the Merrill Lynch 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.”
The total return on the liquidity and enhanced cash tiers of the District’s unrestricted portfolio and
investment benchmarks were as follows:
Liquidity Tier:

3rd Quarter

Y-T-D

RTD cash and cash equivalents:
B of A/Merrill Lynch 3-month U.S. T-Bill Index

0.568%
0.562%

RTD enhanced cash:
B of A/Merrill Lynch 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index:

0.561%
0.639%

2.309%
2.364%

The yield of the District’s unrestricted portfolio for the month of September was 2.13%. Year to date
invest earnings if annualized would produce earnings of approximately $8.1 million.
Historical performance of RTD Liquidity Tier investments relative to the Investment Policy benchmark is
reflected in the following graph:

Historical performance of RTD Enhanced Cash Tier investments relative to the Investment Policy
benchmark is reflected in the following graph:

In addition to the liquidity and enhanced cash tiers of the District’s portfolio, all other reserves are
invested in accordance with state law and additional guiding documents such as bond indentures,

LiVE Update

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: November 6, 2019
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: November 12, 2019
Information

BACKGROUND
In 2018, the RTD Board of Directors approved a new income-based fare discount program to be
implemented along with several other fare changes in 2019. This new program was named LiVE
(pronounced as in “live your best life”) and was developed using recommendations from the Pass
Program Working Group and public input. LiVE fares offer a 40% discount from RTD’s full fare rates
for eligible customers. To be eligible for the LiVE program, participants must live within the District,
have household incomes at or below 185% of the federal poverty level and be between the ages of 20
and 64 years old. Other RTD fare discount programs apply to those that are ages 19 and under and
ages 65 and older.
In conjunction with the implementation of LiVE, the non-profit fare discount program will transition to
new rules after December 31, 2019.
DISCUSSION
In order to use the discounted LiVE fare products, customers must be able to present a valid LiVE
eligibility card to bus operators and fare inspectors. To obtain this eligibility card, customers must
apply through the State of Colorado’s Program Eligibility and Application Kit (PEAK) website. The
PEAK website is the application point for several public assistance programs, and now also offers an
option to apply for the LiVE program.
Applicants who are enrolled in certain medical, food, or cash assistance programs and fall under the
income threshold for the LiVE Program will automatically be approved (“categorical eligibility”) for the
LiVE program if they choose to apply and fulfill the age and address requirements. Applicants who do
not participate in assistance programs may apply for the LiVE program as well. After an applicant has
submitted all required information through the PEAK system for the LiVE program and has uploaded a
photo, applications that were not automatically approved by the system are reviewed for eligibility by
Denver Human Services. Data for applicants who meet the eligibility requirements and have uploaded
a photo is transferred to RTD and RTD’s LiVE eligibility card vendor for production, mailing, and card
administration. Approved participants can expect to receive their eligibility card within about two
weeks of application approval. Applicants who do not meet eligibility requirements or do not provide
the required photo or information are notified by mail.

Packet Pg. 271

2.C.5

The PEAK application for the LiVE program became available to the public on July 29, 2019.
As of November 3, 2019, 2,652 LiVE eligibility applications have been submitted, 1,567 have been
approved, 743 have been denied and the remaining 342 are pending. Of the 743 denied, 489 of them
were denied because of age, i.e. they were 19 or younger or 65 and older which entitles them to a
better discount. 176 were denied because their address was out of District, 8 were denied because it
was a duplicate application, 4 were denied because the applicants were already enrolled, 5 were denied
because they did not respond to requests for additional information, and 61 were denied because they
did not meet the income threshold.
In addition to going live on July 29th, the following actions have been completed:

Step-by-by step instructions for applications as well as other materials are available
through the RTD LiVE web page. A LiVE Program handout has been created and printed.
The instructions and handout are available in English and Spanish.
The LiVE application process in PEAK is available to applicants in both English and
Spanish.

whose cards have been lost or stolen.
The livecard@rtd-denver.com mailbox is active and being utilized to communicate with
customers about photos and cards and to field questions.
A feedback form about the LiVE application experience is available on the RTD website.
RTD staff have promoted the LiVE program and answered questions at community events.
RTD hosted live and webinar training by PEAK Outreach (Boulder County) for nonprofit
organizations that are interested in helping their clients apply for LiVE.
RTD has refined the communications plan for LiVE and is expanding outreach and
marketing activities.
The team has started working on identifying requirements for PEAK enhancements related
to the LiVE application and application processing.

RTD is working closely with the State’s software vendor and Denver Human Services to
work out remaining “bugs”.
RTD staff is pursuing targeted outreach opportunities and is also including LiVE
information and brochures in other RTD outreach activities.
Denver Human Services is providing information and training about LiVE applications to
county and community partners.
RTD is working with nonprofit agencies to ensure a smooth transition from the current
nonprofit program rules procedures to the new ones that go into effect in 2020.

RTD will continue to refine communications materials and outreach activities.
RTD will conduct a survey of LiVE customers for feedback on all aspects of the LiVE
program.
The team will use feedback from customers, partner organizations, and RTD staff to
evaluate potential enhancements to systems, procedures, and communications.
