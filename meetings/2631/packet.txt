Subject:

Salaried DB & DC Contribution

CFO/AGM,

Board Meeting Date: October 24, 2017

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
adopt a 2018 contribution of $5.1 million to RTD’s Salaried Employees’ Defined Benefit Pension Trust
(the “DB Plan”), which pays a specified monthly benefit at retirement. It is also recommended that the
RTD Board of Directors adopt a 2018 contribution of 9% of each participant’s eligible compensation to
the Salaried Employees’ Defined Contribution Plan (the “DC Plan”), which contributes a specified amount
to the plan for each year of employment.

BACKGROUND
In December, 2007, the RTD Board of Directors closed the DB Plan to new employees with new
employees hired on January 1, 2008 and later participating in the DC Plan. From January 1, 2008 to
December 31, 2012 both the DB and DC Plan had been funded on a 9% of salaries basis.
DISCUSSION
DB Plan
In 2012, the Board of Directors agreed that beginning in 2013, annual contributions to the DB Plan
would be made at a fixed annual amount of $3.1 million rather than as a percentage of salaries as a
result of the actuary’s recommendation at that time. The fixed annual contribution of $3.1 million to the
DB Plan was determined by the plan’s actuaries to be the annual contribution necessary to maintain a
“fully funded” status for the plan in the future.
The actuaries have updated the DB Plan projections to reflect the final 1/1/2017 valuation assumptions
for the DB Plan. The 2018 Actuary recommended contribution is $7.3 million. If RTD contributed $5.1
million in 2018, and $5.1 million each year thereafter, 100% funding could be reached in 2037. If RTD
contributes $5.1 million in 2018 and the recommended contribution each year thereafter, 100% funding
could be reached in 2031. Under this scenario the recommended contribution is $5.1 million in 2018,
$7.0 million in 2019, $7.2 million in 2020 and starts to decrease thereafter, falling below $5.1 million in
2028. This also assumes an annual rate of return of 7.5% per year. This option has been deemed too
costly to fund at this time.
The recommendation is to increase the annual fixed contribution by $500,000 to $5.1 million.
DC Plan
Section 4.1 of the RTD Salaried Employees’ DC Plan adopted by the RTD Board provides that the
Employer may, at its sole discretion, set a contribution rate between 7 to 9% per year for participants.
The contribution rate has been 9% each year to the DC Plan from 2008 through 2017.

ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended that the RTD Board of Directors adopt a 2018 contribution of $5.1 million to
RTD’s Salaried Employees’ Defined Benefit Pension Trust (the “DB Plan”), which pays a specified
monthly benefit at retirement. It is also recommended that the RTD Board of Directors adopt a
2018 contribution of 9% of each participant’s eligible compensation to the Salaried Employees’
Defined Contribution Plan (the “DC Plan”), which contributes a specified amount to the plan for
each year of employment.
2. The RTD Board of Directors could certify an amount to be contributed to the RTD Salaried
Employees’ Defined Benefit Pension Trust or the RTD Salaried Employees’ Defined Contribution
Plan at amounts other than $4.6 million and 9%, respectively.
3. Do not authorize a contribution to the RTD Salaried Employees’ Pension Plans. This is not
recommended because the DB Plan’s funding status would deteriorate and the liability would
increase.

GM
Board Meeting Date: October 24, 2017

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approves the 2018 Plan Year Salaried Benefits plan and authorizes the General Manager/CEO or his
designee to enter into agreements with the insurance carriers.

BACKGROUND
Annually the staff brings the proposed Salaried Employee Benefits plan for approval to the Board of
Directors. Approval of the plan by the Board establishes the rates for Open Enrollment and provides
costs for the 2018 Budget. The Open Enrollment period for salaried staff begins November 5 through
November 20, 2017.
DISCUSSION
The goals for the 2018 plan year are: 1) Achieve the 2018 budget goals, 2) Continued focus on
containing cost and emphasis on improving health and wellness consumerism, 3) Maintain market
competitiveness, and 4) Insure compliance with PPACA – Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
(Health Care Reform provisions as applicable to RTD).
Following is a summary of the changes for the 2018 plan year.
Medical
-

Kaiser HDHP – No plan changes
Kaiser DHMO
o Increased Deductibles
 Individual from $600 to $800
 Family from $1,200 to $1,600
 Loss of grandfathered status on this plan will result in deductibles and co-pays
being credited toward the maximum out of pocket cost
o Add a new tier pharmacy benefit - 20% up to $250 per script on specialty drugs

-

Cigna HDHP – No plan changes

-

Cigna PPO
o Increase office co-pay visit from $20 to $25
o Increase specialist co-pay from $20 to $50
o Increase emergency room co-pay from $250 to $500
o Add a new tier pharmacy benefit - 20% up to $250 per script on specialty drugs

Utilize the Cigna Local Plus network vs the Cigna OAP network

Based on input from the Board in 2016, the Benefits Committee reviewed the Medical Premiums and
RTD and the Employee share of the premium payment. The Benefits Committee is moving toward the
less expensive plans, Kaiser, as being the base plans to which employees would buy up for Cigna.
- Year one (2018) participants on the CIGNA plans, HDHP and PPO, premiums will be
calculated as follows:
o RTD will pay (full Cigna premium – like Kaiser premium)/3
Dental
-

We are still in a rate guarantee period. There is no administrative fee or plan change.

Life & Disability

There was a significant increase in rates due to utilization and coming off a rate guarantee- we
are putting this out to bid.
Vision/Business Travel Accident
-

We will be changing providers to Superior Vision. Superior Vision has a better network and a better
benefit for contacts. The rates are almost identical.
We recently renewed the organization’s Business Travel Accident insurance for three years; there
was no increase in premium.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The 2018 planned Salaried Employee Benefit budget is projected to be a 2% over 2017 projected benefit
costs.

Packet Pg. 6

1.B.2

The major cost impacts in 2018 are due to an increase in Cigna life insurance. The premiums are higher
based on projects increases in salaries. Basic Life is 1.5 x annual salaries. There was also a significant
increase in life and long term disability claims. Due to the price increase, we are putting this out to bide
to see if we can get a better rate. This is the eighth year we have achieved strong cost containment as
a result of our shift in carriers, plan offerings, plan design and funding models.
The 2018 estimate of the Salaried Employee Insured Benefits is $13,864,043. The projected increase
of 4% results in an increase of $550,848 in 2018. The increase meets the projected costs in the
Strategic Budget Plan (SBP).
Affordable Care Act (ACA) Employer Fees:
PCORI = Patient Centered Research Institute, these fees fund a government agency that studies patient
outcomes. We pay a set fee per plan member annually; the fee goes up each year, indexed to the CPI.
Members include all persons covered under our self-funded plans.
TRI = Transitional Reinsurance fee the last payment was paid in November 2016
NOTE: All projected costs are based on the current employees enrolled in 2017
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors approves the 2018 Plan Year Salaried Benefits plan and authorizes the General
Manager/CEO or his designee to enter into agreements with the insurance carriers.
2. Further modify the salaried employee benefit plans to be offered in 2018. This is not
recommended since it would require additional negotiations with benefit providers and delay
the employee enrollment period.
3. Do not approve the recommended salaried employee benefit plans. This is not recommended, as
this will result in the Agency being unable to provide competitive and cost effective benefit
plans to the salaried employees.

Adoption of the Strategic Budget Plan and
Annual Program Evaluation

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: October 12, 2017
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: October 24, 2017

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors adopts the 2018-2023 Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) and the 2018-2023 Annual Program
Evaluation (APE).
This action item meets policy requirements and the General Manager’s goals of Fiscal Sustainability
by effecting current and long-range budgeting in a timely manner.

POLICY REFERENCE
Fiscal Policy Statement – Capital Improvement Policies 1 and 7, Budget Policies 13 and 14
BACKGROUND
Capital Improvement Policy 1 of RTD’s Fiscal Policy Statement states that “On an annual basis, RTD will
prepare and update annually a six-year Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) including projected capital
construction and improvements, service levels and operating costs, and revenues to fund the capital and
operating programs.” Capital Improvement Policy 7 states that “RTD will prepare an annual update of
the FasTracks Annual Program Evaluation (APE) which will be integrated with the SBP incorporating
actual costs incurred and the most recent available projections of capital improvement costs, service
levels, and operating costs and revenues to fund the FasTracks capital and operating programs.”
The SBP and APE are RTD’s six-year financial plans. Updated annually, they provide important cash
flow planning information used to determine the District’s operating, investing and financing activity as
well as services that the District can provide using projected financial resources. The first year of the
SBP and APE serve as the basis for the preparation of the annual budget.
Each year during the planning process, operating costs are estimated and capital projects are developed
to support the goals and objectives of the District. Estimates of other expenditures, such as principal
and interest payments on long-term debt, are also developed as part of the overall costs to the District.
The other major component of the plans is the estimate of available revenues during the six-year time
period. These estimates of costs and revenues are brought together to insure that RTD will have
adequate resources to meet cash flow needs.
Per RTD Fiscal Policy Statement, RTD will contract with a qualified third party to provide sales and use
tax forecasting containing projections for the short term (one year), medium term (SBP and FasTracks
APE) and long term (financial plan). RTD has contracted with the University of Colorado-Leeds School of
Business for this service. See “sales and use tax” in Discussion below.

Packet Pg. 8

1.B.3

Capital and operating/maintenance projects are evaluated based on their relative costs and benefits,
relative need, and to what extent they meet the RTD mission statement and State of Good Repair
priorities; projects are constrained to operate within the forecast of revenues and funding sources
available for their completion and operation.
The SBP and APE also provide the basis for the District’s application for federal transit funding through
the Transportation Improvement Program (TIP), prepared by the Denver Regional Council of
Governments. The TIP is a list of all roadway and transit projects in the region that receive federal
funding. RTD cannot receive federal funds for projects unless the SBP/APE qualifying projects are
included in the TIP.
The 2018-2023 SBP includes service and projects funded from the Base System 0.6% sales and use
taxes. The 2018-2023 APE includes service and projects funded from the FasTracks 0.4% sales and
use taxes. Projected Base and FasTracks future expense and projects for the period 2024-2040 are
presented separately in the Long-Range Financial Plan.
DISCUSSION
Strategic Budget Plan
The attached SBP incorporates the 2017 amended budget and includes all known adjustments and
best estimates at this time. The SBP was presented to the Financial Administration and Audit
Committee on May 16th, July 18th, and August 8th for discussion. The final presentation follows in
this document on October 17th with staff recommendation for Board adoption on October 24th.
Exhibit I
Exhibit I (attached) summarizes the 2018-2023 projected cash flow through the extension of the
2017 Amended Budget.
The column titled “Adjusted Amended Budget 2017” in Exhibit I
incorporates revenue and expense adjustments approved in the Amended Budget and subsequent
known items.
The SBP is balanced through the six-year period after incorporating into the projections 1) the
September sales/use tax forecast from CU-Leeds School of Business, 2) minimum/must-have SBP
requested projects, including minimum fleet requirements, within State of Good Repair (SOGR)
parameters, 3) reductions, eliminations or deferrals of non-critical SBP requested projects, 4) use of
the capital replacement reserve fund to support planned fleet purchases, 5) contribution to reserve
funds, and 6) no new debt issued. No service reductions other than reprogrammed fixed route
service are proposed in the SBP through this period.
Exhibit I summarizes the 2018-2023 projected cash flow activity based on the staff recommendation
incorporating the following:
 Revenue estimates:
 Fare revenue of $115.2 million in 2018 is projected to be slightly higher over 2017. The fare
revenue is forecast using the fare model and current data on average fare paid per boarding.
Fare rate increases in the fare model are assumed in conjunction with Board policy. (Line 1)
 Sales and use tax incorporates the September semi-annual update from the CU-Leeds School
of Business for the years 2018-2023. In all years of the SBP, the medium baseline forecast

Packet Pg. 9

1.B.3

from CU is used. Of the total forecasted amounts, 0.6% is apportioned to the Base System.
(Line 2)
o The CU-Leeds forecast contains confidence bounds on total RTD revenues. The mean
forecast for 2018 of $626.2 million is bracketed by 67% confidence bounds of $584.4
million on the low side and $666.9 million for the upper bound. The upper bound
estimate is 6.5% higher than the medium baseline forecast, reflecting more robust
economic conditions that could materialize. It is not impossible or unrealistic that revenue
could grow somewhat strongly over the next year. Likewise, economic threats pose
downside risk to the forecast, with a 6.7% lower bound. The values of the high and low
forecast bounds are computed as 67% confidence bounds, meaning that a 0.67
probability exists that the interval between low and high forecast values will contain the
actual value of the variable being predicted.
 Grant revenue estimates are based upon past trends, formula allocations, known proceeds,
and recent congressional actions. Amounts are escalated at the area Consumer Price Index
(CPI) (obtained from Moody’s) or as identified. (Line 3)
 Other income consists of on-going advertising revenue, joint venture revenue, and IGA and
miscellaneous rental income, escalated at the CPI beginning in 2018. (Line 4)
 Operating expenses (excluding depreciation):
 Operating expenses are increased at area CPI rates and then adjusted for known items and
necessary reductions.The area CPI rates follow:(Line 6)
2018: 2.8%
2019: 3.1%
2020: 2.9%
2021: 2.7%
2022: 2.6%
2023: 2.6%
 Service increase consists of the cost of new CMAQ-funded service projects to be operated by
RTD in years 2016-2019 to include service enhancements on Routes L and 324, Route 73
extension, Superior and Broomfield call-n-Ride services, and Anschutz Medical Campus
Shuttle. These services are included in the DRCOG TIP. RTD costs will be reimbursed in full
by CMAQ grant funds and contributed funds from the applicable municipalities. Determination
will be made in future years whether to continue such service at RTD’s cost. (Line 7)
 Costs of operating the West Line, R Line, DUS Bus Concourse, Free MetroRide, BRT, the HLine extension and SERE are allocated from Base to FasTracks based on resource drivers on a
full-allocation basis for all years of the SBP, thus, Base total expenses are reduced by the
amount of the allocation. Prior to 2017, the allocation was made on an incremental basis; it
was changed to full allocation including administrative and support costs beginning in 2017.
(Line 8)
 Expenses include the Collective Bargaining Agreement at a negotiated amount through 2017
plus an adjustment to capture current and anticipated higher costs, and then escalated at the
CPI rate for 2018-2023. (Line 9)
 Diesel fuel is forecast at an estimated lock price of $1.80/gallon in 2018 and then escalated
at the national CPI rates as follows: (Line 10)
2018: 2.5%
2019: 3.0%
2020: 2.7%
2021: 2.4%
2022: 2.3%
2023: 2.2%

Gasoline is forecast at $2.65/gallon in 2018, which is same cost per gallon used in the 2017
budget, and then escalated at the national CPI rates above. (Line 10)
 The line item for expense projects (O&M) includes specifically identified minimum/must-have
operating and maintenance projects based on SOGR priorities. These projects are detailed in
Exhibit III. Other projects may be added based on available cash flow if sales tax revenue
improves or there are excess fund balances at year-end. Specific projects will be determined
from the deferred project list in Exhibit IV. (Line 11)
 The FasTracks service increase, or “rubber tire” service based on the 2004 FasTracks
Financial Plan whereby FasTracks will fund enhanced bus service on the Base System,
increases by the CPI rate serially each year. (Line 12)
Interest income is based on current yields adjusted for expected changes in investable balances
and forecasted interest rates per forward rate curves. (Line 15)
Interest expense is calculated by individual debt instruments outstanding during each year (for
current debt and future debt as applicable) by using debt amortization schedules. Interest
expense is forecast only on existing debt balances because the plan assumes no new debt issued
through 2023. (Line 16)
The line item for capital expenditures includes specifically identified minimum/must-have capital
projects based on SOGR priorities, plus the minimum required new fleet, detailed in Exhibit II.
Dollar amounts of the new fleet are determined so as not to exceed cash flow constraints
determined in the SBP model. Other projects may be added based on available cash flow if sales
tax revenue improves or there are excess fund balances at year-end. Specific projects will be
determined from the deferred project list in Exhibit IV. (Line 19)
The Fiscal Policy Statement establishes a Board-appropriated fund, capital replacement fund, and
unrestricted operating reserve.
 Staff recommends that the Board-appropriated fund be funded at a minimum of $3 million
each year in 2018-2019, not funded (not drawn) in 2020, drawn by $7.0 million in 2021 to
help balance the SBP, and then funded at $5 million each year in 2022-2023. This fund is
projected to reach a balance of over $26 million in 2023. (Lines 20 and 33)
 Staff recommends that the capital replacement fund be drawn entirely in 2018 for fleet
purchases and then funded by $3.0 million each year beginning in 2022. This fund is
projected to reach a balance of $6.0 million in 2023. Per the 2017 Amended Budget, the
capital replacement fund was replenished to $2.7 million in 2017 after having been used in its
entirety in 2016 for fleet acquisition. (Lines 21 and 34)
 The Fiscal Policy Statement in Fund Balance Policy 4 allows for the designation of an
unrestricted operating fund used to respond to unanticipated events, including revenue
shortfalls. The unrestricted operating reserve was established in 2017 and funded with
available cash flow. Staff recommends that the unrestricted operating fund be funded at a
minimum of $5.0 million each year in 2018-2019, drawn by a total of $19.7 million in 20202021 to help balance the SBP, and then funded with available cash flow in 2022-2023. The
SBP will apply available dollars toward the operating fund such that it reaches nearly $29
million in 2022 and reaches over $59 million in 2023. (Lines 22 and 35)
 The total of these three funds is projected to be nearly $92 million in 2023.
A transfer to FasTracks for Base System support of FasTracks operations is not anticipated to be
necessary over the course of this six-year SBP. (Line 23)
Financing proceeds represent COPs issued for bus and light rail vehicle acquisition in accordance
with fleet schedules, net of grant funding and use of capital acquisition fund. No new debt is
issued during the SBP term in order to maintain required debt service coverage. (Line 25)

Packet Pg. 11

1.B.3

 Principal payments on debt are derived from individual debt instruments outstanding during each
year (for current debt and future debt as applicable) by using debt amortization schedules.
Principal payments are forecast only on existing debt balances. (Line 26)
 Other line items consist of the roll-over of the unrestricted fund ending balance at 12/31/17,
estimated changes to restricted reserves, and the use of previously-issued COP-bond proceeds for
future year capital expenditures. (Lines 29, 30, and 31)
 The SBP is balanced during the six-year period as shown by the positive unrestricted year-end
fund balance. The objective is to maintain a minimum unrestricted year-end fund balance of $2
million each year through 2023 while supporting a minimum critical level of capital and expense
projects and building reserve fund balances. (Line 32)

As required by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), RTD must review its SBP for any Title VI
impacts (disproportionate impacts on minority and low income communities). Any service changes
specified in the SBP will be reviewed for Title VI impacts during the service planning process prior to
final recommendations on service changes. For the capital component of the SBP, Title VI impacts are
reviewed on improvements that are over and above the state-of-good-repair elements (repairs,
replacements and rehabilitations) of the capital program. The Title VI review will be provided and a
statement from the Planning Department to this effect is attached.

Annual Program Evaluation
The underlying assumptions for the 2017 Annual Program Evaluation (APE) are consistent with those
used in the SBP:
 Fare revenues are projected using the same fare revenue model and fare increase
assumptions, adding revenue for new lines at their projected opening dates
 Sales and use tax projections for the 0.4% sales and use tax incorporate the September 2017
CU-Leeds forecasts
 Grant revenues are based on existing grant agreements and past trends, adjusted at CPI as
appropriate
 Interest income on available balance is projected using the same methodology as for the SBP.
 The cost allocations to FasTracks from the SBP and the FasTracks “rubber tire” service
increase feed directly from the SBP.
 Operating and maintenance costs for the Eagle Project are derived from the Concession
Agreement.


The total FasTracks project budget through 2020 included in the APE is approximately $5.6 billion.
Project-by-project costs and the changes from the 2016 APE are included as Exhibit VII.
The major changes between the 2016 and 2017 APE involve the North Metro Project. The proposed
APE assumes RTD operation and maintenance of the corridor, with DTP maintaining the vehicles, and
includes mobilization and startup costs to support RTD operations. Additional funding also is required to
complete the current scope of construction of the corridor to 124th Avenue. Specific changes are
detailed below:
 Additional funding to cover the current scope to complete - $52.7 million
o Additional RTD overhead
o Head-end tie-in
o Risk associated with scope gap/betterments
o Riverside grade crossing elimination
o Additional parking at end-of-line station
 Capital costs for mobilization for corridor operations - $19.9 million
 Other costs for mobilization for corridor operations - $12.8 million
The average annual operating and maintenance cost for the first ten years of North Metro operations is
projected at $25.9 million in 2017 dollars.
Outside of the North Metro Project, the project cost changes to this APE are relatively small. These
changes primarily reflect updates to project scope and timing, or work that has been completed under
budget. These changes result in a net savings of $12.2 million through 2020, as summarized below.






Additional funds required for project closeout staffing and extension of project closeout to
2020 - $5.4 million
Savings from projected completion of the I-225 project under the 2016 APE budget - $15
million savings
Reduce remaining budget for the Free Metro Ride to the $1.5 million required for City and
County of Denver capital improvements - $1.8 million savings
Reduction in program wide capital costs - $0.7 million savings

Future implementation of projects not included in the current APE would require identification of funding
sources for construction and operations, and would require approval of the Board. Therefore, the APE is

a dynamic tool, which is updated annually as projects move towards completion and any changes
approved by the Board are incorporated.
The projected APE cash flow through 2023 does not require Base System funding to support FasTracks
corridor operations and maintenance. However, the FasTracks Capital Acquisition Fund is drawn down
in 2021, and funding from the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) will be needed between 2021
and 2023, to fund FasTracks corridor operations and maintenance. The cash flow by year through 2023
is presented as Exhibit VIII.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The staff-recommended SBP and APE provide RTD with a plan for maintaining a positive unrestricted
year-end fund balance in each year of the SBP while growing reserve fund balances. However,
uncontrollable economic factors, such as sales tax revenue, cost of fuel, materials, and supplies, as well
as economic conditions will continue to have an impact on the SBP and APE, and may challenge staff to
present new options and solutions during the 2018 budget period.

ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended that the RTD Board of Directors adopts the 2018-2023 Strategic Budget Plan
(SBP) and the 2018-2023 Annual Program Evaluation (APE).
2. Defer the adoption of a 2018-2023 SBP and 2018-2023 APE to a later date. This is not
recommended because the SBP and APE identify the capital programs, expenditures, and service
guidelines for the 2018 budget process and adoption of the plans serves as a confirmation of the
Board of Directors' vision for the 2018 Budget.
3. Provide staff additional direction in the selection of assumptions for the projected 2018-2023 SBP
and 2018-2023 APE. This is not the desired action and will result in delay of the SBP and APE
adoption and possible delay in the 2018 budget process.

Project Description

TrapezeCOM has been the only customer complaint and commendation
tracking tool in use for the past 8 years at RTD and most departments find it
difficult to use and limited in its functionality. Various departments/projects like
Communications, FasTracks, and the SmartCard system use their own
customer issue tracking/management tools to collect customer data and
feedback that is not integrated. Reporting from TrapezeCOM is also not
conducive to the needs of the District. Customer Care and other departments,
including Legal, are unable to pull reports to view a customer's overall
interaction/relationship with RTD. Also, the current system has no analytics
capabilities, so we are unable to pull reports to understand complaints about
specific routes, lines, stops, etc.

The recommendation from studies like the SmartCard Business Process Reengineering (SMT BPR) and Fare Systems visioning exercise is that RTD
procure and implement an Enterprise Level CRM system that would meet the
needs of all departments and projects. The first phase (2018) of this project will
be to implement a contact center customer relationship management tool for
servicing customer needs and to replace the TrapezeCOM functionality as a
customer service case management need. The future phases (2019 and
beyond) will be to integrate and implement the service module to other needs
of RTD towards marketing/sales, etc. SaaS (Software as a Service) market
solutions like salesforce.com/Oracle CX/Microsoft Dynamics are top Cloud
CRM leaders. IT management of the CRM product will suffice with one cloud
administrator to administer and manage the cloud subscription and support
implementation.

Enterprise Content
Management

Districtwide

This project will implement a District-wide comprehensive Enterprise Content
Management (ECM) solution to consolidate identified existing systems that
create, capture or store content at RTD to create a single point of access. The
project scope will include the development of policies, procedures, taxonomy
and metadata for the consistent identification, use, maintenance, retrieval,
retention, and destruction of data. The project also will include identification of
personnel and tools required to implement the policies and procedures,
implementation of the system, and the development of training and audit tools
to support the ongoing utilization of the system.
The current project cost estimate beyond the approved scope for IQBG
assumes that RTD will own and maintain the hardware and software in-house.
As part of its scope, IQBG will recommend a path forward for procurement of
ECM tools, which could include externally hosted systems or software-as-aservice (SaaS) systems instead of in-house tools. If a hosted or SaaS system
is selected, the cost structure of the project and future staffing levels will
change.

The proposed project would allow the Legal Services division (“RTD Law”),
which functions as RTD’s in-house law firm, to come into compliance with its
legal and ethical obligations. There are three components: (1) secure
management and sharing of legal records along with case management of
those legal matters; (2) docketing and calendaring of court-mandated
deadlines; and (3) collection, review and production of electronically stored
information (“ESI”) for purposes of executing and enforcing legal holds and
producing documents in litigation and in response to other requests.

RTD currently is on version 12.1.3 of Oracle E-business suite. This current
version of Oracle E-business suite support will end in 2021. RTD would need
to upgrade to the next version starting 2019 or start looking at alternatives in
2018. Project is to implement the future of business applications such as
finance, HR, procurement, recruitment, and so on. The project will assess the
need to upgrade existing technologies and/or investigate/implement new
technologies for these business functions. The project will analyze the need to
move/segregate the business functions as necessary in order to upgrade
existing application or move to the cloud or SAAS (software as a service)
services. Under the project IT will upgrade the components needed to be
upgraded on premise applications and/or help move functions to the cloud and
build integrations to allow for hybrid implementation between cloud and onpremise.

CCTV Retrofit on LRV

Districtwide

This project is requested to replace 189 LRV CCTV recorders and cameras
that have surpassed their useful lives. This retrofit has been designed to match
CCTV systems that are currently specified within the new bus orders for
standardization. These modern systems also provide the ability to remotely
retrieve video from the Security Command Center. In addition, the LRVs are to
be outfitted with forward facing and cab operation cameras to aid in the
investigations of accidents. Forward facing cameras will assist by providing
information as to the status of signals, switches and crossings as vehicles
move along the rail system. This request is to provide funding to complete the
upgrades over a period of 3 years.

This project will include all of the downtown track and infrastructure from 7th
Street to 30th and Downing. This alignment is 23 years old and has been in
service since inception. For the most part this infrastructure has reached its
potential lifespan. There are several projects in place to make repairs and
replace the worst of the defects but an overall plan is needed to replace all
track, turnout switches, street crossings, concrete flat work, etc. Please see the
attached report from MOW and SGR, highlighting the condition of the
infrastructure in the area. This is a six year plan. The alignment will be divided
into segments that can be completely refurbished within the span of one
construction season. Our estimates are at a cost of $3,000,000 per year for 6
years.

Rail Replacement @
Central Corridor

Central Rail Line

The Central Corridor is over 22 years old. For the most part this infrastructure
has reached its potential life span. This repair project will replace existing rail,
switches, concrete flatwork and items associated with the existing rail
alignment which have deteriorated over the past 22 years. The work will be
broken down into zones based on the priority of conditions of the rail and
location. All work will include coordination with City and County of Denver
(CCD), traffic control, and public information (bulletins, radio and TV
announcements).

Burnham Yard Lead
Land Purchase

Central Rail Line

This funding would be used to acquire a 40’ swath of Union Pacific Burnham
Yard property adjacent to the RTD Right-of-Way between 4th Avenue and 13th
Avenue, for a total of 222,982 square feet (5.12 acres). If acquired, the 40’
swath of property would be utilized for additional trackage. This property would
allow for a future 3rd and 4th set of tracks along the Central Corridor. At this
time the two tracks on the Central Corridor are operating at maximum capacity.
Every train in the Central, Southwest, Southeast and CPV uses the Central
Corridor. With additional service tracks we can do heavy maintenance and
increase the capacity of the Central Corridor for future growth. To not purchase
this land and to let it be developed by others will permanently hinder the future
of light rail. This purchases will without doubt make the difference between a
successful rapid transit system and a congested failed light rail system.

Project Description

Cab Signaling on LRVs

Districtwide

The proposed Cab Signaling project would enable RTD Light Rail Vehicles
(LRVs) to constantly display, on the dash of the cab, the maximum speed a
train is permitted to operate based on signal indications and track conditions
ahead of the train. The wayside signal logic transmits a 100 hertz pulsed signal
into the rail using 7 unique pulsed rates, each having a different speed limit
associated with it. If an Operator fails to comply to a reduced speed limit zone
and begins braking within a predetermined grace period, the LRV will
automatically apply brakes and come to a complete stop. The project costs are
estimated to provide for new software and hardware for all 172 of our current
LRV fleet and the additional 29 LRVs on order. Additionally the project funds
would provide for new signal software for each of our existing corridors that
currently have Automatic Train Stop (ATS) functionality.

Project is to construct approximately 18 miles of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) in
the SH 119 Corridor to connect Boulder and Longmont in accordance with the
recommendation of the Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS). It is anticipated
that approximately half of the total costs for this project would be grant-funded.
The establishment of BRT in the corridor would raise ridership from
approximately 1,900 to approximately 5,000 daily weekday riders in 2035.
Detailed cost estimates and design will be established through the upcoming
environmental clearance and preliminary engineering, beginning April 2017.
The project is anticipated to take two years to construct.

Districtwide

$
The RTD Continuous Improvement and Innovation Division leads the E3
Innovation program, a "lean process improvement for government" initiative
undertaken in response to employee concerns voiced in the 2015 Employee
Survey. To address the GM Core Goal to “Successfully Deliver Transit
Service” and the Task Goal for “Workforce/Human Capital,” these initiatives
have met with exceptional early success. The E3 program’s aim is to improve
communication and collaboration by addressing employee frustrations through
training in process improvement and continued support from staff to employ
tools that identify and eliminate waste – improving morale and the service we
provide both internal and external customers. After successful 2016 pilot
efforts focused in Platte Bus Maintenance and Customer Care, the division
has developed a two-year work plan with the GM and Senior Leadership to
engage every department. The E3 model deploys in-house management
analysts to train and support employees using process improvement tools to
deliver small innovations and provides facilitation and project management
support for larger issues affecting the agency through Workshops and "Rapid
Improvement Events". To date, these efforts have used consultants as
management analysts supporting a portfolio of over 350 employees trained
and supported in using these tools. Senior Management suggests the
program should continue to educate and support E3 tools to improve the
service we provide each other and the public, becoming “Just the way we do
things at RTD.” To mature the program, it is recommended to transition from
embedded consultant support toward full time staff, saving money over the
cost of external consultant services (approximately 20% additional cost).

difficult to use and limited in its functionality. Various departments/projects like
Management System
Communications, FasTracks, and the SmartCard system use their own
(CRM)
customer issue tracking/management tools to collect customer data and
feedback that is not integrated. Reporting from TrapezeCOM is also not
conducive to the needs of the District. Customer Care and other departments,
including Legal, are unable to pull reports to view a customer's overall
interaction/relationship with RTD. Also, the current system has no analytics
capabilities, so we are unable to pull reports to understand complaints about
specific routes, lines, stops, etc.
The recommendation from studies like the SmartCard Business Process Reengineering (SMT BPR) and Fare Systems visioning exercise is that RTD
procure and implement an Enterprise Level CRM system that would meet the
needs of all departments and projects. The first phase (2018) of this project
will be to implement a contact center customer relationship management tool
for servicing customer needs and to replace the TrapezeCOM functionality as
a customer service case management need. The future phases (2019 and
beyond) will be to integrate and implement the service module to other needs
of RTD towards marketing/sales, etc.
SaaS (Software as a Service) market solutions like salesforce.com/Oracle
CX/Microsoft Dynamics are top Cloud CRM leaders. IT management of the
CRM product will suffice with one cloud administrator to administer and
manage the cloud subscription and support implementation.

This project was approved in the 2017 SBP. After further analysis, it has been
determined that the project will require $225,000 in Operating and
Maintenance Costs rather than the approved $75,000 in on-going Operating
and Maintenance. The additional funds are necessary because the cost of the
product is higher than we originally scoped. In addition, it has come to light
that there is a need for a new email service and text messaging provider in
order to send out the customized, targeted messages to riders. We are
resubmitting this request to ask for additional Operating and Maintenance
funds to maintain and build upon the product going forward.

Communications is looking to implement a Rider Alert System in order to
communicate up-to-the-minute service alerts for our riders in timely manner.
The system will include a web-based interface that allows staff to create and
manage the thousands of service alerts that are sent out each year. The
Alerts System will be intuitive and fast to use, allowing simple alerts to be
created in seconds. At the same time, the system will offer fine grained control
over selecting the specific route, branch, trip, or stop an alert applies to, when
an alert is in effect, and by what channels (like emails, text messages,
electronic signs, agency website, General Transit Feed Specification real-time
feeds and third party apps) the alerts should be disseminated. The system will
use templates to automatically generate appropriate messages for all the
dissemination channels. This alert system will aid RTD in answering the one
question every rider wants to know: Where is my bus? This alert system
coupled with real-time information delivery will allow RTD to notify passengers
quickly and preemptively, leading to greater customer satisfaction.

This project will implement a District-wide comprehensive Enterprise Content

create, capture or store content at RTD to create a single point of access. The
project scope will include the development of policies, procedures, taxonomy
and metadata for the consistent identification, use, maintenance, retrieval,
retention, and destruction of data. The project also will include identification of
personnel and tools required to implement the policies and procedures,
implementation of the system, and the development of training and audit tools
to support the ongoing utilization of the system.

The current project cost estimate beyond the approved scope for IQBG
assumes that RTD will own and maintain the hardware and software in-house.
As part of its scope, IQBG will recommend a path forward for procurement of
ECM tools, which could include externally hosted systems or software-as-aservice (SaaS) systems instead of in-house tools. If a hosted or SaaS system
is selected, the cost structure of the project and future staffing levels will
change.

In an age where organizations across markets and industries depend heavily
on technology to operate successfully, the IT Auditor plays an increasingly
important role in helping to manage and respond to risks. Information
Technology (IT) Audit was introduced in 2015 to ensure that RTD was
prepared for the current global scenario of Information Technology.
IT Audit was introduced with Board of Directors support, but the resources that
accommodate the successful introduction and ensure efficient and effective
work are still needed. This request will ensure that RTD Audit has the
resources needed to provide assurance on the protection of assets, data
integrity, system reliability and information security as required by the Board of
Directors.

Subject:

Adoption of the Long Range Financial Plan

CFO/AGM,

Date: October 12, 2017
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: October 24, 2017

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
adopts the Long Range Financial Plan.
This action item meets the General Manager’s goals of Fiscal Sustainability by effecting current and
long-range budgeting in a timely manner.
BACKGROUND
The RTD Long Range Financial Plan serves as an extension of the six-year Strategic Budget Plan (SBP)
and Annual Program Evaluation (APE) through the regional planning time horizon, which is currently
2040. This plan is submitted to the Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) for inclusion in
the Regional Transportation Plan (RTP), and projects must be included in order to receive federal funding.
RTD’s lenders also utilize the plan to ensure that RTD has the financial capacity to repay its debt.
DISCUSSION
The Long Range Financial Plan focuses on ensuring that RTD can fund the ongoing operation and
maintenance of the Base System and the FasTracks corridors while repaying its debt obligations. Key
elements of the plan for the years 2024-2040 include the following:






Base System Operations and Capital Replacement
o Continued operating costs based on the final year of the SBP, escalated at the
Consumer Price Index (CPI)
o Annual allowance for major rehabilitation assumed based on 0.5% of installed cost of
existing asset inventory, escalated at CPI
o Additional service for the SH 119 project at its completion
o Replacement of revenue fleet and other assets based on current asset inventory and
replacement schedules, adjusted for major assets purchased in the SBP period
o Replacement of a maintenance facility in 2026 to meet projected capacity needs
FasTracks Operations and Capital Maintenance
o Cost allocations from the Base System based on the final year of the SBP, escalated at
the Consumer Price Index (CPI)
o FasTracks-funded rubber tire service increase based on the final year of the SBP,
escalated at the Consumer Price Index (CPI)
o Eagle operating and maintenance costs derived from the Concession Agreement
o North Metro operations and maintenance costs based on RTD operations, escalated at
CPI
o Annual allowance for major rehabilitation of corridors outside the Eagle Project
assumed based on 0.3% of installed asset value, escalated at CPI
Revenue Projections
o Sales and use tax forecasts from the September 2017 Leeds forecasts

Packet Pg. 39

1.B.4

Farebox revenues forecast using the fare model used for the SBP
 Fare increases tied to the CPI assumed every third year
o Future formula grants forecast based on historic appropriations, escalated at CPI
 Additional fixed guideway grants assumed for FasTracks corridors beginning
nine years after corridors enter revenue service
FasTracks corridor construction
o Additional projects to meet commitments included in the environmental clearances for
federally-funded corridors
o



Exhibit I shows the projected cash flow for the Base System and FasTracks by 5-6 year increments
through the year 2040, including the current projections from the SBP and the APE. The plan shows
positive fund balances on both the base system and FasTracks in every year through 2040.







Need to take a total of $166.2 million from the base system in 2024-2030 to fund FasTracks
expenditures
Need to issue COPs to finance selected Base System capital expenditures in 2026-2028
o Bus maintenance facility in 2026:
o Bus purchases in 2027-2028:
Need to issue COPs to finance FasTracks vehicle replacements and US 36 construction in 2027
and 2030
Reduce combined Board appropriated and operating reserves on Base System to equivalent of one
months of operating expenses in 2024; restore to two months’ operating expenses by 2031
Reduce combined Board appropriated and operating reserves on FasTracks to equivalent of one
months of operating expenses in 2024; restore to two months’ operating expenses in 2031
Use remaining FISA balance to fund FasTracks operations and maintenance in 2024
o Restore FISA balances starting in 2031, as funding becomes available

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The recommended Long Range Financial Plan provides RTD with the means to maintain its current
system in a state of good repair through 2040. Between 2024 and 2030, RTD would not have the
capacity for service expansion or new projects beyond those needed for state of good repair.
Beginning in 2031, positive fund balances begin to accumulate on the Base System and in the restored
FISA. Funding from the FISA would be used to fund the remaining unfunded FasTracks corridors, which
have not been prioritized.

•

Looking ahead, forecasters encounter uncertainty
— Fed policy, Europe, the Middle East, China’s economy, emerging
markets, commodity prices, trade policy, tax policy, etc.
— Frequent revisions of forecasts to reflect new information

• In March 2017, the BRD changed to a more conservative medium term
macroeconomic forecast from Moody’s Analytics titled “Consensus Forecasts”

2018 Requested Budget

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: October 12, 2017
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: October 17, 2017
Information

BACKGROUND
Staff is required to present the 2018 Requested Budget to the Board of Directors in conjunction with
posting it for public inspection. RTD must post its 2018 Requested Budget for public review and
comment by October 15, 2017 in order to meet Colorado legal requirements (CRS 29-1-101). The
preliminary 2018 Requested Budget is included in this document in order to comply with these
requirements. This preliminary Requested Budget is posted to the RTD website and hard copies are
made available in the Board Office for public review.
At this time, Staff is presenting the preliminary first draft 2018 Requested Budget. Preliminary 2018
Requested Budget numbers are subject to further revision and a final budget will be presented in
November. The 2018 Recommended Budget will be presented at the November 14th Financial
Administration and Audit Committee meeting with Staff requesting approval to move to the Board of
Directors for ratification of the 2018 Adopted Budget on November 28th.
DISCUSSION
The Board has requested that staff keep it informed on key budget issues that RTD is facing and provide
opportunities for Board members to offer early input during the development of the 2018 annual budget.
Our previous communication included the 2018-2023 Strategic Budget Plan (SBP), the first year of
which forms the basis for the 2018 budget and which is scheduled to be approved by the Board on
October 24th. We also presented the FasTracks Annual Program Evaluation (APE), the first year of
which forms the basis for the 2018 budget and which is scheduled to be approved by the Board on
October 24th.
The budget is driven by the three top strategic goals established for the GM by the Board of Directors
for 2018, which consist of fiscal sustainability, workforce/human capital, and state of good repair.
During development of the 2018-2023 SBP for the Base System, staff presented a balanced budget to
the Board for 2018. Staff has worked to develop a preliminary proposed budget for the Base System as
set forth in the 2018-2023 SBP. Staff also incorporates FasTracks budget numbers for both FasTracks
Project and FasTracks Operations as set forth in the APE. Both the Base System and FasTracks
preliminary budget make up the 2018 Requested Budget presented here.
The 2018 Requested Budget is compared to the 2017 Amended Budget below with change from period
to period (in thousands). The summary data is from the attached Exhibit I.

OVERVIEW
The 2018 Requested Budget is a first draft budget and includes estimates for sources and uses. The
budget items will continue to be reviewed and the final version incorporating any necessary adjustments
will be the 2018 Recommended Budget scheduled for adoption in November. This Requested Budget
will be updated for items such as fare revenue estimates, sales taxes, grant revenue, and capital
expenditures for both new capital and capital carry forward amounts. Operating expenses will likely be
revised for specific changes.
As stated earlier, staff has developed the 2018 Requested Budget based on guidance from the SBP for
2018 for the Base System and by incorporating the FasTracks 2018 budget from the APE. On a
combined basis, the 2018 Requested Budget consists of the following:
(1) Fare revenue:
a. Farebox revenue is forecasted on the basis of a fare revenue model now being used
to estimate and allocate fare revenue between Base and FasTracks and within
FasTracks service corridors. The model uses ridership forecasts and current data
on average fare paid per boarding. Based on the model, in 2018 a higher amount
of fare revenue is allocated to Base and a lower amount is allocated to FasTracks
than in previous periods.
b. Farebox revenue for the Base System is forecast to increase almost 1% over the
2017 Amended Budget to $115.2 million in 2018. For FasTracks, fare revenue is
forecast to increase 11.6% to $31.6 million over the 2017 budgeted amount.
Overall farebox revenue is budgeted at $146.8 million in 2018, or an increase of
3.0% over the 2017 budget.
c. Ridership growth is expected to be flat on Base with ridership increases attributed
to FasTracks. Total revenue ridership is projected to grow 4.4% in 2018 over that
projected for 2017.
(2) Other operating revenue:
a. This amount includes advertising revenue, joint venture revenue, parking income,
rental income, and miscellaneous operating revenue.
b. Other operating revenue is increased at the CPI over the 2017 Amended Budget
and adjusted for known items. The amount will change if more information
becomes available for the 2018 Recommended Budget. The current run rate for
other operating revenue is generally on track with the 2017 budget.
(3) Sales/use tax:

Packet Pg. 79

1.C.3

a. Combined sales/use tax of $626.2 million is budgeted to increase 4.9% over the
2017 projection, per the CU-Leeds School of Business September forecast. The
2018 growth rate is the CU-Leeds Baseline forecast.
b. The 2017 projection shows an increase in sales/use tax of 5.9% over 2016
actuals, also the CU-Leeds School of Business Baseline forecast.
(4) Grant revenue:
a. Total grant revenue is estimated at $405.7 million, a decrease of $21.6 million
from the 2017 Amended Budget.
b. Operating grant revenue is $91.1 million on the Base System and $15.8 million for
FasTracks. Base System operating grant revenue is budgeted to increase $1.9
million from the 2017 Amended Budget due to fluctuations in funding in fixed
guideway, bus facilities funding, CMAQ, CDOT, and FASTER grant funding for
specific programs. FasTracks operating grant revenue is budgeted to increase $1.3
million due to an increase in STAMPS grants.
c. Remaining grant funds consist of capital grant revenue of $298.8 million. Of this
amount, $61.8 million is budgeted in the Base System and $237.0 million is
budgeted in FasTracks. Combined capital grant revenue is expected to decrease
$24.7 million from the 2017 Amended Budget with most of that coming from a
lower final draw on the FFGA offset by a small increase in CMAQ grants and carry
forward for FasTracks.
d. As more information becomes available and the capital carry forward budget is
finalized, capital grant revenue estimates may change accordingly in the
Recommended Budget.
(5) Investment income:
a. Combined investment income of $7.3 million is projected to increase $3.1 million
over the 2017 Amended Budget due to expectation of somewhat higher interest
rates on investable fund balances. Investable fund balances are projected to
increase organically and through contributions.
(6) Other (non-operating) income:
a. Other non-operating income will increase slightly from the 2017 Amended Budget
due to CPI increases on recurring income such as rental and joint venture income.
b. Recurring non-operating revenue is increased at the CPI (with the exception of the
Build America Bonds subsidy) over the 2017 Amended Budget. The amount will
change if more information becomes available for the 2017 Recommended Budget.
The current run rate for other income is generally on track with the 2017 budget.
(7) Operating expenses:
a. District-wide operating expenses (excluding SBP expense projects) of $628.2
million are budgeted to decrease $33.8 million from the 2017 Amended Budget.
Base System operating expenses are budgeted to decrease $3.0 million, FasTracks
Project expenses are budgeted to decrease $38.4 million, and FasTracks Operations
expenses are budgeted to increase $7.5 million. Base System operating expenses
at this time are target amounts derived from the SBP but may change in the final
2018 budget as deemed necessary.
b. The expense projects carry forward (previously approved expense projects) is not
included in the 2018 Requested Budget; this will be identified and included in the
final 2018 budget.
c. SBP expense projects are not included in the 2018 Requested Budget; these
projects will be included in the final 2018 budget post-Board approval of the SBP.

Packet Pg. 80

1.C.3

d. FasTracks Capital Programs will account for $36.4 million of the decline in
FasTracks Project expenses due largely to completion of several FasTracks projects
and capitalization of certain costs to the uncompleted corridors.
e. Costs of operating the West Line, R Line, DUS Bus Concourse, Free MetroRide,
BRT, the H-Line extension and SERE are allocated from Base to FasTracks based on
resource drivers on a full-allocation basis in 2018, and thus, Base System total
expenses are reduced by the amount of the allocation. Prior to 2017, the allocation
was made on an incremental basis; in 2017, a change was made to full allocation
including administrative and support costs. The amount of the allocation in 2017 is
$37.3 million.
f. FasTracks Operations also includes a $53.1 million estimated service payment to
Denver Transit Operators for Eagle operations and maintenance which began in
2016. The expense is included in the Rail Operations budget.
g. Diesel fuel is budgeted at $1.80/gallon, which is $0.11 higher per gallon than the
lock price in 2017, resulting in an incremental higher cost of approximately $1.1
million over 2017.
h. Gasoline is currently budgeted at an average cost of $2.65/gallon, which is the
same price as in the 2017 budget for no change.
i. Anticipated CBA costs for 2018 are set-aside in the non-departmental line item at
this time. All District rent is included in non-departmental as well as various
customary miscellaneous expenses.
j. Certain items may materialize after SBP approval and after this Requested Budget is
presented. These items will be discussed and prioritized with senior management
and it will be determined if funds can be made available to support these
expenditures.
(8) Debt:
a. Budgeted principal payments of $64.7 million on a combined basis are $6.6 million
higher than the 2017 Amended Budget due to debt restructuring.
b. Base System principal payments of $59.0 million are $9.0 million higher than the
2017 Amended Budget due to scheduled principal amortization on current debt.
c. FasTracks principal payments of $5.7 million are $2.4 million lower than the 2017
Amended Budget due to scheduled principal amortization on current debt.
d. No debt issuance is anticipated for either the Base System or FasTracks in 2018.
Both Base System and FasTracks will draw from previously issued debt to fund
major capital purchases and construction in 2018.
(9) Interest expense:
a. Interest expense is budgeted at $153.2 million, a decrease of $2.2 million from the
2017 Amended Budget due to the effect of refundings and scheduled amortization.
b. Of total interest expense, $21.8 million is budgeted for Base System and $131.5
million is budgeted on FasTracks. On FasTracks, the TABOR interest portion is
$34.4 million, which is paid as part of the DTO service payment.
c. Capitalized interest is budgeted at $21.4 million, a decrease of $11.6 million from
the 2017 Amended Budget. No capitalized interest is budgeted for the Base
System, and the full amount is budgeted for FasTracks solely for the North Metro
debt. Capitalized interest is the interest expense associated with construction
projects that is capitalized as part of the asset value on the balance sheet.
(10) Capital expenditures:
a. Base System new capital expenditures total $57.2 million. This is the amount to be
approved in the SBP for minimum critical projects and is escalated at the CPI of
2.80%.

Packet Pg. 81

1.C.3

b. FasTracks new capital expenditures are estimated at $82.1 million. This is a
preliminary amount subject to change in the Recommended Budget as estimates for
project expenditures in 2018 are reviewed and completed.
c. Capital carry forward (previously approved capital) is not estimated at this time but
will be included in the Recommended Budget because it is based on the 9/30/17
close of RTD’s financial statements.
(11) Reserves:
a. The combined TABOR reserve is budgeted at $24.0 million.
b. The FasTracks management reserve is budgeted at $15.9 million at year-end. This
reserve was set at $30.0 million in 2016 and is now net of Board-approved
transfers to the Southeast Rail Extension (SERE) and North Metro projects.
c. A $5.0 million contingency reserve is created for the first time for the Base System.
The purpose of this reserve is to cover unanticipated needs that may arise through
the fiscal year. The funds will typically be used to fund unbudgeted inflationary
increases, respond to emergencies, new regulations, and to cover cost overruns.
The use of the contingency reserve will be at the General Manager’s discretion. It
was established to minimize excess budgeting for contingency in individual
projects.
(12) Contributed capital:
a. Contributed capital totals $81.1 million for FasTracks, which consists of third-party
betterments, in-kind, and local match contributions for the Eagle project, R Line,
and SERE.
(13) Fund balances:
a. Base System:
i. Increase of $3.0 million to Board-appropriated fund per the SBP for a total
fund balance of $20.4 million.
ii. Use of $2.7 million of capital acquisition fund per the SBP for a total fund
balance of $0.
iii. Increase of $5.0 million to unrestricted operating reserve per the SBP for a
total fund balance of $14.7 million.
iv. The unrestricted year-end fund balance is budgeted at $33.8 million, which is
the fund balance estimated in the SBP. The objective is to arrive at a
budgeted unrestricted fund balance as close as possible to that estimated in
the SBP, regardless of further expenditure adjustments and any revisions to
revenue.
v. Fund balances are increased in a manner consistent with Board policy and the
SBP. The total of the above fund balances is expected to be 14.0% of
projected Base System operating expenses, or $68.9 million by the end of
2018.
b. FasTracks:
i. The total of the same funds for FasTracks is $34.2 million and reflects 3
months of operating expenses for both FasTracks Project/Construction and
FasTracks Operations.
ii. The FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) is budgeted to grow to $67.1
million in 2018 from savings from the R Line under budget and planned
account growth.
c. District-wide:
i. The total combined fund balances excluding the FISA are expected to be
16.4% of projected District-wide operating expenses by the end of 2018.

Reconciling items reflect cash activity in capital projects, inventory, accounts receivable and prepaids, accruals and capitalized interest.

2

Reserves include funds that are legally restricted by bond covenants, other contracts, Board designation and policy guidelines.

3

Reserves are an appropriated reserve which is available to fund unforseen projects expenses (such as a contingency reserve).

4
