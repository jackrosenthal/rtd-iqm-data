Local Government Relations Update

Below is our update for August 2018:
1. Metro Mayors Caucus (MMC) – The next full caucus meeting is Wednesday, August 1,
2018, from 7:30-10 AM at the at the Carla Madison Recreation Center. Congressman
Polis and Colorado Treasurer Walker Stapleton are confirmed to be in attendance. The
agenda includes presentations and discussion on water, transportation and the Fair Maps
ballot initiatives.
2. Transportation Funding Initiative #153 – Last week, the Colorado Transportation
Commission approved 120 highway and multimodal projects that would be funding
across the state should the voters approved an increase in the state sales tax of .62% for
twenty years. Several legislators and local officials along the Northwest Rail corridor
advocated the project be included on the list. The Commission determined the project
was not part of the CDOT planning process, so did not agree to include it on its list. The
Commission did add language acknowledging that “Initiative #153 also provides local
governments with sales tax funds for local transportation priorities and multimodal
projects, including rail, in addition to what the Commission is responsible for, and those
local governments will use their own planning processes to determine project selection
for those funds.”
3. RTD Board Candidates –Nineteen candidates submitted signed petitions by the July 12
deadline. As of today, 13 candidates have been certified as being sufficient and will
appear on the November ballot. The remaining candidates have until 3 PM on August 13
to “cure” there petitions.

Re:

August Board Update

During the legislative session, Senator Baumgardner resigned from his committee positions
including Chair of the Transportation Legislation Review Committee (TLRC) and the new chair
is Senator John Cooke. BBMK attended the TLRC tour of Northern and Northwest Colorado
which included discussions with local officials on transportation funding solutions.
The August 20th meeting will include updates from the Public Highways Authorities and interim
bill draft requests. On October 1st, BBMK has confirmed that RTD will present at 9 am for the
statutorily required update to the committee. BBMK would encourage board members to attend
this meeting.
BBMK is monitoring two transportation ballot initiatives filed by the Denver Metro Chamber of
Commerce and the Independence Institute. Each initiative must submit 98,492 signatures by
August 6th at 3:00 pm to move forward.
BBMK has begun coordinating briefings with legislators on the Pass Program Working Group.
These meetings will take place before the October 1st presentation before the TLRC. In addition
to the meetings on the Pass Program Working Group, BBMK has been interviewing prospective
legislative candidates this summer and fall and briefing them on issues of interest to the District.
Lastly, BBMK is working with RTD Executive Staff to coordinate a tour for legislators of the
Transit Orient Development sites within the District. The tour will happen later in the fall, and
we will keep the Board updated on the scheduling of these tours.
Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions.

Federal Update for August 7 Board Meeting

Chairman Bill Shuster (R-PA) Releases Infrastructure Proposal.
In July 23, House Transportation and Infrastructure Chairman Bill Shuster (R-PA) released
“discussion draft” legislation addressing a broad range of transportation and infrastructure
priorities within the jurisdiction of his committee. Chairman Shuster is retiring at the end of this
year so is free from many of the political constraints that govern transportation policy-making in
Congress. He intends for his proposal to prompt discussions among Members of Congress about
the future of infrastructure in the United States and to serve as a blueprint for any infrastructure
proposal Congress may consider next year. His legislation directly addresses the thorniest issue
facing the surface transportation program today – how to restore the solvency of the Highway
Trust Fund (HTF) – and includes policy changes, such as ways to expedite project approvals,
aimed at supporting smarter and more efficient infrastructure investment.
HTF Revenue Solution
The proposal would address the HTF revenue shortfall by increasing Federal fuel taxes and
broaden the HTF tax base by adding taxes on transit, electric vehicles, and bicycles. Together,
these revenue adjustments would raise $284 billion for the HTF over the next ten years. Specific
tax measures include:


Increasing the Federal gas tax by 15 cents per gallon and the diesel fuel tax by 20 cents
per gallon over three years and then indexing both to inflation.



No longer refunding gas and diesel taxes for mass transit buses and establishing a 4.3
cent per gallon diesel fuel tax on commuter rail.

 Establishing a 10 percent tax on both electric vehicle batteries and bicycle tires.
These tax increases are offered as stop-gap remedies only. The proposal would also establish a
national vehicle-miles-traveled (VMT) pilot program to examine the possibility of replacing the
gas and diesel taxes with VMT-calculated revenues. It would also establish a blue ribbon panel
to evaluate surface transportation system needs, determine the necessary HTF revenues to meet
those needs, and identify revenue solutions. The Commission would not be permitted to propose
simply extending Federal gasoline or diesel fuel taxes.

Federal Update

Multi-modal and Rail Project Proposals
The proposal would authorize the National Infrastructure Investments program (commonly
known as TIGER and now BUILD) long funded by appropriators without an authorization and
would authorize up to $3 billion in funding per year. The program would largely retain its
current form, with minimum grant sizes of $25 million and a maximum Federal share of 80
percent.
The proposal would also authorize $50 million per year to pay the CRPs for new loans under the
RRIF program. This funding, if enacted, could also potentially be used for the repayment of
CRPs on prior loans.
Senate to Vote on FY 2019 Transportation Appropriations This Week.
The Senate is expected to vote on its FY 2019 Transportation, Housing and Development
(THUD) appropriations bill later this week. The THUD bill has been added to a
“minibus,” which is a collection of several spending measures into a single bill.
The Senate THUD bill includes an increase in funding of about $10 billion over FY 2017 for a
wide range of transportation and infrastructure programs, similar to the significant increase
included in the FY 2018 spending bill.


Transit Formula Funding: The Senate provides $800 million above FAST Act-authorized
levels for Federal Transit Administration (FTA) formula programs. This includes:
$161.4 million for competitive bus grants; $29.5 million for competitive low- and noemission bus grants; $362 million for Section 5337 state of good repair formula grants;
and $30 million for Section 5304(d) high-density formula grants.



TIGER/BUILD Grant Funding: The Senate provides $1 billion for the TIGER/BUILD
grant program, a significant decrease from the $1.5 billion provided in FY 2018, yet well
above the $500 million usually provided for TIGER in prior year spending bills.



CIG Funding: The Senate provides $2.55 billion for the Capital Investment Grant (CIG)
program, an increase above the $2.3 billion FAST Act-authorized level, but a decrease
from the $2.64 billion provided in FY 2018.

RTD and SPB Continue our Push in Washington to Secure the Return of the DUSPA RRIF
Loan Credit Risk Premium.
In mid-July, RTD CEO Dave Genova met with key RRIF loan program officials at US DOT and
with Congressional staff for Senator Gardner and for the Senate THUD Appropriations
Subcommittee to get answers to how the Department intends to implement the RRIF loan
program under conflicting language governing the definition of loan cohorts and the return of
CRPs in the FY 2018 and Senate FY 2019 transportation spending bills.
In the meetings with Senate staff, which included authorizers and appropriators with jurisdiction
over the RRIF program, we pressed for language in the final FY 2019 THUD spending bill
directing US DOT to do what the law has long required them to do, which is to define cohorts,
and then to direct US DOT to inform borrowers, including RTD, of those cohort
decisions. These actions by US DOT are the necessary first steps to securing the return of our
CRP on the now-repaid loan for Denver Union Station.
