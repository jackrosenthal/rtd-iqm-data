David A. Genova, Interim General Manager and
CEO

Board Meeting Date: March 29, 2016

Subject:

Purchase of Six (6) Articulated Buses

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the Interim General Manager, or his designee, to exercise an option and amend contract 13-FK001 in an amount not to exceed $4,127,000 with New Flyer of America Inc. for the purchase of six (6)
additional 60’ articulated buses and associated spare components.
It is also recommended that the Board of Directors authorize the transfer of $4,127,000 from the
intercity bus procurement project to cover the cost of the requested 6 new articulated buses.
BACKGROUND
In support of the Board adopted strategic goal of Innovative and Fiscally Sustainable Service Delivery,
including Asset Management/State of Good Repair, Bus Operations has begun the process of replacing
the aging and high maintenance NABI sub-fleet of 60’ articulated buses.
On August 20, 2013 the RTD Board of Directors approved the procurement of 52 New Flyer 60’
articulated buses. This procurement was for the replacement of 40 existing NABI 60’ articulated buses
and also supplied 12 - 60’ articulated buses for the Free MetroRide service. The original procurement
was the result of RTD Request for Proposals (RFP 13-FK-001). Proposals were received on May 17,
2013. The contract allows RTD the options to purchase up to 162 additional buses over a five year
period. Pricing for additional option buses is based on the initial base pricing plus an inflationary price
adjustment computed using the US Department of Labor’s “Producer Price Index” or PPI which is
published monthly.
On June 24, 2014 the RTD Board of Directors approved the contract amendment for additional 40 New
Flyer articulated buses.
On February 17, 2015 the RTD Board of Directors approved the contract amendment for additional 18
New Flyer articulated buses.
The six (6) requested articulated buses will be used to implement service adjustments. These
adjustments are necessary for addressing changes in ridership and customer response to the new US 36
BRT service implementation. The service adjustments call for reducing the number of intercity buses to
be purchased this year and adding more articulated buses as replacement of the old NABI articulated
buses being retired.
This request is for the Board’s approval of the contract amendment to New Flyer to exercise the
purchase option for a quantity of six (6) additional articulated buses and to transfer funds from the
intercity bus procurement project to cover for the cost.
DISCUSSION

Packet Pg. 4

1.B.1

The 60’ articulated buses are low floor for ease of passenger boarding and de-boarding. They will be
equipped with a wheelchair ramp and two wheelchair access areas to allow for ADA compliance.
Their clean diesel engines will meet the latest EPA regulations and will reduce exhaust emissions up
to 90% from the level of the existing buses. The buses will be equipped with an automatic passenger
counting system and a security digital camera system. They will have two passenger doors, 55
passenger seats and two spaces for storage of large items such as walker, child stroller and shopping
caddy.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The quantity of intercity buses was reduced to forty-two (42) from the budgeted quantity of forty-six
(46). This left $4,127,000 in the intercity project.
Service changes have increased the need for six (6) additional articulated buses. As a result we are
recommending the transfer of capital funds in the amount of $4,127,000 from the intercity bus project
to the articulated bus project. No additional funds are required so the capital budget impact is zero.
DBE PARTICIPATION
There is no DBE requirement for transit vehicle purchases. Each vehicle manufacturer is required by the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to submit a DBE plan for FTA approval. As part of the required
proposal submittal documents, New Flyer has submitted a certificate attesting to FTA’s approval of its
DBE plan.
ALTERNATIVES
1. To authorize the General Manager to issue a contract amendment to New Flyer for the purchase of six
(6) additional articulated buses and transfer the capital funds. This is the recommended alternative.
2. Do not authorize the contract amendment and re-solicit proposals. This is not desirable as it would
result, at the very least, in a delay of the delivery of the buses and may increase the cost of the project.

Subject:

B and G Line Bus and Rail Service Plan

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the B and G Line Bus and Rail Service Plan package as revised and summarized in Attachment A
resulting in an annualized cost of approximately $72,700 in addition to the cost of the B and G Line
commuter rail service cost as included in the Concession Agreement, and, further, to authorize the
Interim General Manager or his designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private
operators whose service is impacted by these changes.
BACKGROUND
As part of the overall FasTracks program to enhance rail service in the Denver region, the upcoming
Northwest and Gold rail lines also known as the B Line and G Line respectively will represent significant
milestones in achieving improved connectivity and travel times for RTD customers. The B & G Line Bus
and Rail Service Plan (Northwest and Gold Line Service Plan) contains recommendations for developing a
restructured bus network capable of meeting the demand and mobility needs generated by the expansion
of commuter rail and light rail services. Recommendations in this proposal were formulated based on a
comprehensive assessment of existing conditions, service area demographics, transit market research,
route performance and analysis, and stakeholder input.
The project area is defined by the RTD West Line to the south, the US 36 & Broomfield Park-n-Ride to
the north, Interstate 25 and downtown Denver to the east, and the City of Golden to the west. The
study area included the cities of Arvada, Denver, Thornton, Westminster, and Wheat Ridge, as well as
unincorporated areas in Denver and Jefferson Counties.
The first 6.2-mile segment of the Northwest Corridor, from DUS to south Westminster is expected to be
completed in the Summer of 2016. This segment will serve two stations including Denver Union Station
and Westminster/71st Ave. The expected travel time from Westminster to Denver Union Station is
expected to be 11 minutes. While the corridor will not replace existing bus services, there are a number
of changes to the existing bus network that are proposed in concert with the implementation of the B
Line service in order to better serve B Line stations.
The G-Line is a future 11.2-mile commuter rail line that will run along the BNSF Railway and Union
Pacific Railroad right of way from Denver Union Station (DUS) to the City of Wheat Ridge. The G-Line
will serve eight stations, including DUS, 41st/Fox, Pecos Junction, Clear Creek/Federal, 60th &
Sheridan/Arvada Gold Strike, Olde Town Arvada, Arvada Ridge, and Wheat Ridge/Ward. The G-Line is
expected to open in the Fall of 2016. Total travel time between DUS and the Wheat Ridge/Ward terminal
station is approximately 25 minutes. By the nature of its alignment and planned services, this rail service
will replace Routes 55L and 72L.

1.B.2

DISCUSSION
The critical goal for the B and G Line Bus and Rail Service Plan is to build a simple, easy-to-use network
that is comprised of a family of bus and rail services, all focusing on delivering the overall network
experience desired by existing and potential customers.
To fully ensure that the transit network makes the most effective use of limited operating resources, it is
imperative that the recommendations are congruent with RTD’s vision for a regionally integrated transit
network that will improve mobility.
Significant investments have been made in new rail alignments to improve regional mobility. The Gold
Line Corridor offers new fast regional train service between Wheatridge and downtown Denver,
providing new transit network opportunities. The Northwest Corridor also opens new network
opportunities for both rail and bus transit from Westminster to downtown Denver with the potential for
future expansion. Adjacent or intersecting bus routes to these corridors have been considered for
realignment to serve the new rail stations, resources of duplicative bus service reallocated, and bus route
alignment changes made to refocus network coverage. Through these actions, an integrated transit
network is proposed that will attract riders, reduce operating costs, and strengthen regional and
community mobility.
The following route design strategies were used in the development of this proposal, which focus not
only maintaining high operating efficiency, but providing an improved customer experience that will
attract more riders and operating revenue:
Route Streamlining
The Gold and Northwest Corridor Service Plan calls for limiting deviations to just areas that can
justify the additional travel time and costs by high ridership on the deviation – areas such as rail
stations, transit hubs, and major destinations in order make individual routes, as well as the
transit network, more productive and attractive to riders. In cases where the deviation was
providing needed lifeline coverage, alternative service was proposed while also proposing
streamlined corridor bus transit.
Short-Lining
Routes often vary in terms of ridership and performance along the length of their alignments.
Generally, areas with higher population and employment densities generate more ridership than
areas with lower densities. For example, Route 76 serves the Wadsworth Boulevard corridor
where ridership is much stronger between the Olde Town Arvada and Lakewood City Commons.
Cost-effective short-lining has been proposed in such instances using either an interior short-line
(long-line running the full length with the short-line between Olde Town and Lakewood) or a
service overlap (north terminal to Lakewood and south terminal to Olde Town) depending on the
off-peak ridership pattern and customer through-riding.
Stop Consolidation
One of the greatest sources of operating delay and on-time performance impacts is dwell time at
bus stops. While closely-spaced bus stops increase the ease in which riders can access the
transit system that convenience comes at the expense of operating speed and service reliability.
Closely spaced stops not only impact route
performance, increase stop maintenance costs, and accelerate bus maintenance costs, but they
can significantly reduce the competitiveness of the service. By finding an optimal balance of stop
spacing to maintain convenient access to transit service while reducing potential for delay, the
efficiency and effectiveness of transit can be increased significantly. While stop consolidation is

Packet Pg. 7

1.B.2

not proposed per se as part of the Gold and Northwest Corridor Service Plan, it is recommended
that RTD continue is stop consolidation program throughout the bus network
Corridor Segment Consolidation
In some instances where multiple routes serve the same corridor at different points, it is more
intuitive for the customer to have one streamlined route that serves the corridor continuously. If
general travel patterns on the corridor show a higher degree of through travel relative to local
mobility, routes that link complimentary origins and destinations together were consolidated to
increase rider convenience by eliminating or reducing transfers required to complete their trip
along a natural transit corridor. In some cases this results in restructuring the corridor into routes
with consistent roles: one is streamlined to serve the main arterial with frequent service while one
or more are designed to serve the neighborhood interior with less direct service where walk
access to the main corridor is not feasible.
Route Segmentation
In contrast to the segment consolidation strategy, where routes exhibited a very high proportion
of rider transfer activity at a single point, the benefits of separating those routes into two distinct
routes at that point to improve schedule adherence or scheduling efficiency was evaluated. This
was primarily due to the low number of riders remaining on the bus and traveling through the
point in question. These actions also results in routes with more balanced service levels on either
side of this midpoint based on demand.
Low Performing Service Replacement
If a route or route segment performed poorly and the potential to improve performance appeared
to be limited within the existing configuration, then alternatives to fixed route service were
considered.
The B and G Line Bus and Rail Service Plan is anticipated to be implemented Summer 2016 with the
opening of B Line service from Westminster to downtown Denver. The G Line is currently expected to
open later in the Fall of 2016. The Northwest and Gold Line Preliminary Service Plan was completed on
June 29, 2015. Stakeholder meetings to review the preliminary plan were held between June 29 and
July 24. 2015. A review of the preliminary plan was presented in the August 11, 2015 RTD Board
Operations and Customer Service Committee meeting, resulting in revisions to the preliminary plan prior
to the public meeting process. Public comments were taken up to November 18, 2015, along with
subsequent meetings with municipal and community organizations leading to an update to the RTD
Operations Committee, provided on February 9, 2016.
The Final B and G Line Bus and Rail Service Plan is proposed herein is as result of an extensive study of
the area conducted by RTD Staff and consultants; ongoing interactions with RTD (Board Members and
staff), community and municipal organizations. This proposal can be viewed as a starting point for a
continued effort to improve overall transportation mobility and increase transit market share in the
Northwestern Metro area, through a multi-modal integrated transit network.
SUMMARY OF PUBLIC HEARINGS
Five public hearings were held during the public comment period, which extended from November 9th
through November 18th of last year. There were 60 participants in attendance at the public meetings
and a number of comments were also heard through RTD’s service change website. Letters from the
municipal, civic and community organizations were also received both in support and showing concern
for the proposal. Comments from these meetings and the service change website are summarized in
Attachment B of this report. Letters received are contained in Attachment C.

CHANGES TO INITIAL RECOMMENDATIONS
Staff receives input during the public comment process and continues to conduct additional analysis
after the initial service recommendations are communicated to the Board of Directors. Depending on the
outcome of the public comment process and continued analysis, staff may or may not propose
modifications to these initial recommendations. The following represent substantive changes proposed to
the service changes initially communicated to the Board of Directors for implementation as part of the A
and R Line Bus and Rail service change:
Route 8 – North Broadway: service frequency enhancements deferred
Route 17 – Red Rocks College: route service merged with the new Route 125
Route 19 - North Pecos: change of routing between 33rd and 46th Avenues
Route 51 – Sheridan Crosstown: proposal to deviate to Harlan Street
Route 55 – South Arvada: off peak service frequency revised
Route 76 – Wadsworth Boulevard: SW Plaza extension proposal eliminated
Route 92 – 92nd Avenue: discontinuance of service west of Sheridan eliminated
Route 95 – South Westminster: proposal postponed until Westminster Mall underway
Route 100 – Kipling Street: hourly Sunday service proposed
Route 125 –Youngfield/Ward new service proposal
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The base system cost impact of the B and G Line Bus and Rail Service Plan is estimated to be $72,700
annualized. The operating and maintenance costs of the B and G Lines are a part of the Eagle P3
contract to be paid from the FasTracks budget on a defined schedule.
EQUITY ANALYSIS
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and
Executive Order 12898 regarding Environmental Justice. In this circular, the FTA requires RTD to
evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that exceed the established major service
change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a disproportionately negative impact on
minority or low-income populations. Our evaluation of the proposed B and G Line Bus and Rail Service
Plan service changes do not reveal any disparities in impacts absorbed by minority or low-income
populations.
A LOOK AHEAD – Fall 2016
The following items are service concepts currently under consideration or are planned events that impact
operations in the next service change period:
 refinements to the A and R Line bus and rail service plan implemented in April 2016

Public Meeting Comments

Monday, November 9th, 2015
Blake Administrative Downtown Denver
12:00 noon
Doug Monroe conducted the meeting. Staff members Cooper Langdon, Nataly Erving,
Dave Menter and Chris Marko were also in attendance. There were no elected officials in
attendance and there was a count of 8 members of the public who signed in.
Most of the comments were in the nature of questions going after specifics on the service
changes as follows:
Route 92: The planned cut of route 92 between Sheridan Station and Wadsworth Blvd
caused concern to Prentice Ehret because it will leave only the route 104 serving where
he lives near 92nd & Piece. There will be no service on the weekends. He has two bad
knees and the walk that he would need to get to the route 100 on 88th Ave would be very
difficult for him. When it was mentioned that this was due to low ridership in this area,
Mr. Ehret suggested that being that this is an “end” of the route would be a likely cause of
the low ridership compared to the rest or central parts of the route.
Other:
Train Noise Raoul Martinez, who lives near 80th & Sheridan was concerned about how
much noise the new train will cause in his neighborhood.
Call-n-Ride Services Charlene Corson who lives in Wheat Ridge uses light rail trains to get
to classes at Marilyn Hickey ministries, located just south from Orchard Station. She has
no problem when the call-n-Ride vehicle is situated at that station, but when it’s not there,
walking to the ministry building is difficult as many of the property owners near the station
“forbid” RTD riders from walking across their property. RTD staff suggested that she use
the phone number to schedule trips from the LRT station to her classes when needed.
Applewood Village Transfers Lisa Myers inquired if the current transfers between the
buses at Applewood Village (Youngfield & 38th) continue to operate after the changes are
made.

Route 100 and Oak Street Station. Helen Bushnell wanted to voice her concern about
splitting the Route 100 and discontinuing service to Oak Street Station. She stated that
there are a lot of passengers who transfer to the Route 100 at Oak Station and that the
portion of the route 100 between (Oak Station and 56thAve) has the highest ridership.
She also feels that ridership will increase at Oak Station when the fairs are restructured on
the W-Line.
She suggests that if we split the Route 100, we should continue service to Oak Station
and split it there. Helen said that sometimes the bus will get stuck in bad weather on the
southern portion of the route, so splitting the route at Oak Street Station would benefit
passengers who sometimes are affected by adverse weather.
Helen also feels that RTD should monitor that the private contractors are notifying
passengers concerning upcoming Service Change, and that the passengers have not be
notified about the proposed changes on the route 100. She also thinks that we should be
holding a meeting somewhere in the Lakewood area concerning these changes on the
route 100.
Helen said that the clocks that are on the private contractors buses are not correct, but
the operators say they have to go by that time.
Route 32 and North Arvada Service. Marilyn Rittenhouse is concerned about any changes
that could affect her getting to North Arvada from her residence at 21st & High. She is
very unhappy about the service reduction on the route 32. She sometimes needs to get to
Rose Hospital and now has to use three buses to get there.
A few years ago we combined the route 7 and the route 12 making it more convenient for
passengers riding through not having to transfer, why are we now proposing to do just
the opposite with the route 6 and 100.
Route 100 and 51 – Operational issues - Kenny Shepard does not see the point of splitting
the route 100. He feels that a lot of passengers would be inconvenienced having to make
a transfer. Kenny said that this was proposed with the opening of the W-Line and that it
was not split then do too many passengers complaint.
He was also concerned with the restructure of the route 51 on Sheridan, as well as the
routes on Federal.
Kenny would like to see RTD have better coverage at the train platforms for waiting
passengers during adverse weather in Colorado. He also thinks that we should have
turnstiles for fare collection. He is concerned because he rarely sees fare inspectors on the
trains.
RTD should place the Ticket vending machine down in DUS so passengers can buy tickets
with their credit cards because they do not have the exact change for the fares for the
bus. Sometimes he tells passengers to go up to the train platform to get there tickets for
the buses.
He would like to see something done with the way the passengers are lining up at the
gates in DUS. He said sometimes you can’t tell which line to get into, and that the
passengers are blocking the walk way for people walking through the Station.

Route 9 - Bruce Bazo lives at 9th & Vrain St and rides the route 9. He would like to see the
service extended on this route later in the evening. It is difficult to make it home before
the last bus. He thinks RTD should add one more trip that would run closer to 10pm in
order for residents to stay out later.

Wednesday, November 11th, 2015
Irving Street Library
6:00 PM
Doug Monroe conducted the meeting. Staff member Nataly Erving was attendance.
There were no elected officials in attendance and there was a count of 6 members of the
public who signed in.
Route 92 - Roger Sillars is concerned about proposed discontinuation of Route 92 west of
US 36 & Sheridan Station. Provided write up of comments (‘Concerns with proposed RTD
2016 Service Changes’) to staff and reiterated that a discontinuation of Route 92 service
west of Sheridan would create a hardship for many residents in that area and force a twotransfer trip. He added that Route 100 is not an alternative to Route 92 in this area, due to
the steep hill along Wadsworth between 88th and 92nd streets, which is almost impossible
to maneuver by passengers in wheelchairs or other ADA challenges. There are no other
direct connections through the neighborhood. Mr. Sillars suggested that staff look at
extending Route 92 to Vance and perhaps even Yarrow, west of Wadsworth in order to
better serve the Covenant Village community, which has a number of residents and staff
depending on public transportation.
ParknRide Locations – Doug McGee: question about changes to Park-n-Ride locations
associated with the opening of the B and G lines. Mr. Magee asked if any other stations,
besides current Olde Town Arvada and Ward Road Park-n-Rides where going to experience
significant changes in location or access. He suggested that that information be included
in the final brochure and marketing information for these two projects.
Route 125 - Duncan Smith was concerned with north/south route at end of line in Wheat
Ridge. Mr. Smith was very pleased to see the addition of Route 125 to the plan and
commended staff for this. He did ask for clarification of routes represented on the map
provided to the public by gray lines vs. the colored lines, in order to make sure that all
routes represented by gray lines were to be continued and not experience any changes
associated with the opening of the B and G lines. Mr. Smith was happy to see the split of
Route 100 and addition of Route 99, as well as Route 51 and addition of Route 53. Lastly,
he requested for staff to consider Express service along Federal (Route 31) and perhaps
even Sheridan (Route 51).
Route 92 - Pat Hall is concerned about discontinuation of service on Route 92
(misunderstood that it was only to be west of US 36 & Sheridan). Ms. Hall also asked for
clarification as to why there were only going to be two stops/stations on the B line and
that Westminster Station was going to be the only train access to Downtown Denver from
Westminster. She also asked for clarification on the proposed changes to Route 31 north
of US 36, as well as Route 72 and mentioned that there is a community of low income

and several homeless people who depend on these routes to get to places they need to
get to (area near Westminster High School). Mr. Hall also commented that the fare
changes were a negative impact to this specific low income or no-income community.

6:00 PM
Doug Monroe conducted the meeting. Staff member Cooper Langdon and RTD Board
Member Natalie Menter were in attendance. There was a count of 21 members of the
public who signed in.
Routes 72, 52, 92,100, 51 - Teresa was interested in finding help navigating the routes.
Route 86X - Lindsay asked if the 86X was being discontinued. She was informed that the
86X was being absorbed by the new FF routes RTD has implemented. She also asked if
the buses leaving Union Station could be better timed with buses coming from the Boulder
area. Specifically mentioned the Rte. 0 as it leaves Union Station.
Route AB – Cokie mentioned that she was concerned that the AB was going to be
discontinued from Westminster Park-n-Ride when the new A Line opens. Doug explained
how the new service to DIA will be covered by the A Line.
Bicycle Access - Michael rides a bike and finds it difficult to take a bike on any of the RTD
Light Rail trains because there is very little room to store a bike and the doors are not open
long enough to find a location if there are a lot of bikes already on the train. He wanted to
know if any addition space or consideration has been given to the new commuter rail cars
that are going to be used on the new rail lines. He also wanted to know if the train
operators could wait if passengers are having a difficult time loading bikes. Doug
mentioned the expense of adding additional rail cars just to handle bikes. Additionally, he
wanted to mention that it is sometimes difficult to plan a trip on our buses, with his bike,
because if a bus bike rack is full he has to wait for the next bus which negatively impacts
his plans for the day. Finally, he asked if the Route 44 could go all the way to Golden.
Doug mentioned the low ridership and high cost associated with extending the route to
Golden.
Route 125 - Mrs. Brenan wanted additional information regarding the proposed new Rte.
125. She wanted to know exactly how far the route would go and if our call-n-ride would
cover passengers who live in the area currently serviced by the 72X, which is scheduled
to be discontinued. She also wanted to know if RTD was planning any new service to
cover additional housing growth. Doug mentioned that RTD is always looking at growth
and the need for new RTD bus service.

Subject: Proposed RTD bus service changes
Dear Mr. Monroe:
Thank you for visiting the City of Arvada and presenting the preliminary bus service plan to city staff in
our public works department, as well as the Arvada Citizen Transportation Advisory Committee. The city,
along with Arvada's Citizen Transportation and Gold Line Advisory Committees, appreciates RTD's
willingness to meet with us in advance of the official release of the proposed service plan changes as a
result of initiating Gold Line commuter rail service. We also appreciate information about the recent
update to the proposed service plan changes which proposes a new route to provide service between Olde
Town Arvada and the Arvada-Ridge Gold Line Station located on Kipling Street.
This letter is presented in response to the city' s concern that the proposed changes to the service plan will
eliminate fixed route and Access-A-Ride service to large portions of the community. We anticipated and
agree with the elimination of some bus services that parallel the Gold Line; we do not agree with
eliminating the 52 and 72X routes that currently provide service to the west side of Arvada. We also hoped
to see additional routes incorporated in the service plan update that would increase connectivity between
neighborhoods in Arvada and the FasTracks transit network and we do not feel that the one additional route
proposed meets that objective.
We are concerned with the current proposal for the following reasons:

Population growth in west Arvada: Arvada is experiencing heavy growth in the west and
northwest sections of the city. As of July 2015, 21 development projects are under design and
construction west of Ward Road. The 52 and 72X RTD bus routes serve an area with a population
of approximately 50,000. The current proposed service plan change would eliminate these two bus
routes which would require residents who live in the western half of the city to drive to park and
ride locations in order to access transit. The city is concerned that this would present barriers to
transit ridership on the west side and would leave a large portion of our community effectively
without adequate access to transit service.
Arvada Comprehensive Plan goals and recent zoning changes: During the 2005 and 2014
comprehensive planning efforts, the Arvada community supported multimodal travel and requested
that the land use and transportation plans integrate transit elements. This is reflected in several of
the goals set forth in the City of Arvada Comprehensive Plan adopted by the Arvada City Council
in September 2014. This is also reflected in recent zoning changes which allow for clusters of high
density and mixed-use zoning nodes on major streets throughout the city, including in northwest
8101 RALSTON ROAD

Arvada. In addition, the Candelas development located in northwest Arvada was designated as an
Urban Center in 2011 by DRCOG. The current service plan changes proposed by RTD are
counterproductive with many of the goals in the comprehensive plan and recent zoning changes
because it will leave a large portion of west Arvada without R TD bus service and it does not
provide sufficient connector routes between neighborhoods.
Past and future investment in multimodal infrastructure in support of transit: In support of
the comprehensive plan goals and recent zoning changes, the city has invested, and continues to
invest, significant resources in multimodal infrastructure such as bike lanes and sidewalk
connections in support of transit. We feel strongly that the community needs "feeder bus routes"
and high frequency bus service to complement the recent and future multimodal infrastructure
investments the city has made, as well as to provide adequate transit service for all of our citizens.
Demand by Arvada's aging population and individuals with disabilities: The housing and
transportation needs of senior citizens and individuals with disabilities are becoming a concern for
Arvada and Jefferson County. The Senior Resource Center (SRC) is reporting that nearly 600
requests for SRC buses in Arvada were unfilled in 2014 due to high demand. Our understanding of
RTD's policy is that ADA transit service is only provided within the areas serviced by fixed route
buses. The current proposed service plan changes would eliminate fixed route service and therefore
eliminate Access-A-Ride transit services for the western half of Arvada, despite the documented
demand for such service. Fixed route bus service must continue in this area so that Access-A-Ride
options remain available for the elderly and individuals with disabilities.

In summary, the City of Arvada is concerned that the proposed service plan changes will result in a lack of
transit service and a lack of Access-A-Ride service for a significant portion of the city. The Preliminary
Gold and Northwest Corridors Service Plan, June 2015, states on page 45 that if a poorly performing route
is eliminated, alternatives to fixed route service such as Call-n-Rides, special shuttles, service routes or
commuter oriented programs will be considered. The proposed service plan does not show that these
alternatives have been offered for this area. Furthermore, we feel that the proposed changes are
counterproductive to many of the goals in the recently adopted Arvada Comprehensive Plan and will result
in increased traffic congestion and unwanted environmental impacts. The city recommends that RTD
revise the service plan update so that it adheres to the community's expectations for a well-connected and
strong bus service. The plan should maintain existing bus patrons and attract new riders with the opening
of the Gold Line. The plan should also support Arvada's past and future bicycle and pedestrian
infrastructure investments.
We appreciate your consideration and look forward to a revised bus service plan that reflects the interests
of the Arvada community.

Subject: Proposed RTD Bus Service Changes

Dear Mr. Monroe:
As Chair of the Jefferson County Transportation Action and Advocacy Group (JEFFTAAG), I
have been asked to write you concerning bus routes near and around the new Gold Line.
JEFFTAAG is a consortium of Jefferson County communities including the cities of Arvada,
Wheat Ridge, Golden, and Lakewood in addition to unincorporated Jefferson County. The
membership of JEFFTAAG is excited about the new commuter rail line and the great
enhancement it will be for our communities. However, we want to ensure that changes to
RTD's bus service plan do not create negative impacts to our citizens.
We anticipate and agree with the elimination of some bus service that parallel the Gold Line.
However, we want to make sure RTD preserves adequate service to the west side of Arvada
and portions of unincorporated Jefferson County. JEFFTAAG members also request routes be
incorporated in the service plan update that would increase connectivity between nearby
neighborhoods in west Arvada and the FasTracks transit network. We are encouraged that one
additional route is proposed to help meet this objective, but with the significant growth in this
large area, additional routes are necessary. We are also concerned about the service that has
already been eliminated to the west of the end of line station in Wheat Ridge, unincorporated
Jefferson County, and Golden .
Jurisdictions throughout Jefferson County have invested in multi-modal infrastructure that
supports transit. We are supportive of feeder bus routes and high frequency bus service that
meets the needs of our citizens and that will provide access to the new commuter rail lines.

the of Jefferson County communities.

SUBJECT:

Preliminary Gold & Northwest Corridors Service Plan – June 2015

We have reviewed the Preliminary Gold & Northwest Corridors Service Plan dated June
2015 for the proposed bus service to the Wheat Ridge Ward Station. The comments below
also incorporate the exhibits from your e-mail on November 9, 2015, discussion at our
meeting on November 10, 2015, Lee Cryer’s e-mail on November 17, 2015, and the traffic
information that was part of the approval of the Special Use Permit (SUP) for the Station.
We have the following concerns regarding this submittal:
1. Gold Line Corridor Transit Operations Plan (October 7, 2009) – The data shown in
this document is consistent with our understanding of the proposed design of the
Station. These assumptions were what formed the basis for the Record of Decision
(ROD) for the Gold Line project dated November 2009 and the SUP for the Station
that was approved on September 9, 2014.
a. Figures 5.2 and 5.3 on pages 49 and 50 show that the opening day boardings were
estimated at 700 per day and the 2030 boardings were estimated at 1,100 per day.
According to Cryer’s e-mail, the 2030 boardings are now estimated at 800 per
day.
b. Figure 5.4 on page 51 shows that it was estimated that 37% of the passengers
would be arriving by bus and 62% of the passengers would be arriving by car. For
opening day, this equates to 259 bus passengers and 434 car passengers. For 2030,
the bus passengers increase to 296 and the car passengers increases to 496.
2. Ward Road Station – Traffic Impact Study Summary (May 19, 2014)
a. Exhibit A – Bus Circulation Map (October 2013) shows a total of 7 bus routes
serving the Station with a total of 19 buses during the peak hours and 15 buses
during the off-peak hours.
b. The number of buses and high percentage of ridership was the basis for the
Station design, most notably the 8 bus bays and a relatively small parking lot with
290 parking spaces.
3. Wheat Ridge Ward Road Station SUP
a. Work on the latest service plan started in March 2014. This SUP was approved by
the City six months later on September 9, 2014. An important part of the approval
of this SUP was that the traffic impacts would be as assumed in the ROD and the
Traffic Impact Study Summary.

4. Ridge Road Catalytic Study (December 2014)
a. This study focused on future transportation needs related to the Gold Line Station,
including future improvement recommendations for Ridge Road and bicycle and
pedestrian access between the station and surrounding destinations.
b. Also included in this study was the completion of a comprehensive traffic study
that utilized available data from the Gold Line EIS process and more recent traffic
information from RTD, which consistently assumed that access to the station
would be by automobile and bus, with a significant percentage by bus.
c. Based on that information, the traffic study by the City’s consultant determined
that a traffic signal will be warranted at the intersection of Ward Road and 50th
Avenue (Ridge Road) on opening day.
d. The City met with RTD and CDOT to discuss this issue on March 16, 2015, with
any willingness to participate in the construction of a signal being essentially
dismissed by staff of those agencies.
5. Gold Line Bus Service Recommendations
a. Map 10 in the service plan shows no bus routes serving the Station. See
discussion on the reinstatement of Route 125 below.
b. Route 51 Diversion to Harlan Street – We have had several requests to improve
the stops along the diversion to Harlan Street. One of the stops currently has a
shelter which we placed based on high ridership and that RTD currently helped us
enhance. During our meeting, keeping the diversion was discussed because of
high ridership.
c. Route 52 – This route was proposed to be eliminated in the 2009 plan, but was to
be replaced by a feeder route to the Station.
d. Route 55 – This route appears to have been added between the Arvada Ridge and
Olde Town Arvada stations.
e. Route 72 – This route was proposed to be replaced by a feeder route to the Station
from the west. It appears that this route has also been revised in the updated plan
to better serve central Arvada, but no service for west of the Station.
f. Route 125 – The reinstatement of this route provides a valuable connection to the
Station. Although, in the previous plans, the frequency of service was higher for
both the peak and non-peak hours.
6. Process – This section in the latest service plan opens with a statement that “RTD is
developing this service plan in concert with” “municipal” “stakeholders”.
a. We certainly do not feel that adequate contact was initiated by RTD, especially
given the drastic reduction in bus service compared what was presented during the
SUP process.
b. We are also astonished that the drastic reduction in bus service was not mentioned
at the City’s Town Hall Meeting on August 31, 2015 that was held a few months
after the draft plan was completed by the RTD representatives that were present to
provide an update on the Gold Line.
c. Had we been adequately notified of this plan and the public meetings that were
recently completed, we would have helped with the advertisement of the meetings
through our normal outlets.
7. Observations and Concerns
a. With the reinstatement of Route 125, there is only one bus route serving the
Station with a total of two buses during the peak hours and one bus during the offPacket Pg. 32

peak hours. This is a major departure from all of the information that was
received by the City over the last six years.
b. The drastic reduction in bus service compared to the assumptions in the ROD
does not deliver what was promised during that process. Is there a need to revisit
the ROD to reflect the revised service plan?
c. We are surprised that this service plan was started several months before the
approval of the SUP and that the drastic reduction in bus service was not
discussed prior to the SUP being approved. It seems likely that some preliminary
data concerning the drastic reduction in bus service was known prior to the SUP
being approved.
d. We are even more surprised that the drastic reduction in bus service was not
discussed during the meeting on March 16, 2015, just a couple of months before
the latest service plan was completed. Especially given the fact that the purpose of
this meeting was to discuss potential traffic impacts. Surely some of the RTD
representatives at that meeting were aware of the drastic reduction being planned
in bus service to the Station.
e. Presumably, the vast majority of the 700 boardings on opening day will arrive by
car, which increases the number of car trips by around 60%. This increase in car
trips likely elevates the need for a traffic signal and other surrounding roadway
improvements for access and public safety needs as much more critical.
f. We also wonder what has changed in the service area to cause the drastic
reduction in bus service, particularly since the Bus Circulation Map (October
2013) that was submitted with the Traffic Impact Study Summary for the SUP. If
anything, the population and employment density has increased with a resurgence
of development within our Northwest Sub-area since 2009 and continued growth
in the western portions of the City of Arvada since 2009.
8. Recommendations
a. The drastic reduction in bus service compared to the information included with
the SUP requires that a revised traffic impact study be provided to evaluate the
adverse impacts of the large increase in car traffic.
b. Mitigation of those adverse impacts could result in a revaluation of both the size
of the parking lot for opening day and the need for additional improvements at the
Ward Road intersections prior to opening day.
c. The diversion for Route 51 along 38th and 44th Avenues to Harlan Street needs to
be reinstated.
d. Could Route 55 be extended to the west to the Station possibly by way of Miller
Street, I-70 Frontage Road North, and Tabor Street?

Anschutz Shuttle Pass through Funds

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the Interim General Manager or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into
an Agreement with the University of Colorado in an amount not to exceed $2,157,000 for the purpose
of distributing grant funds in order to fund the Anschutz Shuttle. This Agreement is for the period 20162019.
BACKGROUND:
With the relocation of the Fitzsimons Light Rail Station on the new R Line, the University of Colorado
agreed to operate a shuttle to transport customers around the Anschutz Campus. In 2015, the
University of Colorado applied for a Congestion Mitigation Air Quality (CMAQ) Grant for a shuttle to
operate on the Anschutz Campus. This grant was approved with funding available 2016-2019. Total
funding for the project was approved at $2,157,000. CMAQ funds account for $1,509,000 and local
matching funds are committed at $648,000. The University of Colorado will contribute the entire local
match.
Because the RTD has been designated as the agency responsible for distributing CMAQ grant funds to
local recipients, the RTD will receive the federal funds and in turn will reimburse the University of
Colorado for the federal share of the grant.
The Anschutz Shuttle will operate on the campus serving the Fitzsimons Station. The shuttle will
operate seven days a week, 5:30am-8:00pm.
DISCUSSION:
RTD is the designated recipient of federal funds in the metropolitan area. The RTD will provide local
RTD local funds to reimburse the University of Colorado for the federal share only of the CMAQ
grant. In turn, RTD will draw down the federal funds to cover the RTD cost. RTD’s responsibility
will be to track expenditures over the course of the grant and reimburse the federal share. The
Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) approved this grant and the approach for
reimbursement in the 2016-2021 Transportation Improvement Program.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
Funds to reimburse the University of Colorado Anschutz shuttle for the federal share of the CMAQ
Grant for 2016 were included as local funds in the 2016 RTD budget. All funds expended by the
RTD will be reimbursed through the grant process.

Route L Pass through Funds

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the Interim General Manager or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into
an Agreement with Boulder County in an amount not to exceed $2,080,000 for RTD to provide
expanded Route L service. This service will be funded through CMAQ grant funding and local match
funds provided by Boulder County. This Agreement is for the period 2016-2019.
BACKGROUND:
In 2015, Boulder County applied to DRCOG for a Congestion Mitigation Air Quality (CMAQ) Grant for an
expanded Route L service. This grant was approved with funding available 2016-2019. Total funding
for the project was approved at $2,080,000. CMAQ funds account for $1,664,000 and local funds are
committed at $416,000. Boulder County will contribute the entire local match.
The Route L operates between the cities of Longmont and Denver. Under the grant, service will be
provided hourly during the off peak weekdays and every 90 minutes on Saturdays.
DISCUSSION:
Prior to the grant, the Route L grant operated a trip every two hours during the off peak weekdays
and operated 3 trips on Saturday with 3 hour frequencies. This grant will provide additional non
peak service and additional service on Saturdays.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
Funds for the provision of the expanded Route L service are included in the 2016 budget. All funds
expended by the RTD will be reimbursed through the grant process.

funding for the project was approved at $1,470,000. CMAQ funds account for $1,176,000 and local
funds are committed at $294,000. The City of Longmont will contribute the entire local match.
The Route 324 currently operates weekday 6:00am – 6:00pm and Saturday 8:00am – 6:00pm. Under
the grant, weekday service will be extended to 8:00pm and Sunday service will be added 8:00am –
6:00pm.
DISCUSSION:
The Route 324 service will extend later into the evening and offer Sunday service to the community
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
Funds for the provision of the expanded Route 324 are included in the 2016 budget. All funds
expended by the RTD will be reimbursed through the grant process.

Route 62 Pass through Funds

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the Interim General Manager or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into
an Agreement with Commerce City in an amount not to exceed $1,695,000 for RTD to provide the new
Route 62 service. This service will be funded through CMAQ grant funding and local match funds
provided by Commerce City. This Agreement is for the period 2016-2019.
BACKGROUND:
In 2015, Commerce City applied for a Congestion Mitigation Air Quality (CMAQ) Grant to extend the
existing Route 73. This grant was approved with funding available 2016-2019. Total funding for the
project was approved at $1,695,000. CMAQ funds account for $1,355,000 and local funds are
committed at $340.000. Commerce City will contribute the entire local match.
The Route 73 currently operates between the Denver Tech Center and Central Park Station. Under the
grant, service will be extended north from the Central Park Station to Parkway Drive and 60th Avenue.
In February 2016, RTD, Commerce City and the Denver Regional Council of Governments agreed that
the creation of a new Route 62 would take place rather than extending the Route 73.
DISCUSSION:
The Route 62 will offer connections to the University of Colorado A-Line and numerous RTD routes
at the Central Park Station. This new route will provide service to a new high school in the area and
special event service to Dick’s Sporting Goods Park.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
Funds for the provision of the new Route 62 (extension of the Route 73) service are included in the
2016 budget. All funds expended by the RTD will be reimbursed through the grant process.

Superior Call-n-Ride Pass through Funds

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the Interim General Manager or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into
an Agreement with the City of Superior in an amount not to exceed $530,000 for RTD to provide
Superior Call-n-Ride service. This service will be funded through CMAQ grant funding and local match
funds from the City of Superior. This Agreement is for the period 2016-2019.
BACKGROUND:
In 2015, the City of Superior applied to DRCOG for a Congestion Mitigation Air Quality (CMAQ) Grant
for a new Superior Call-n-Ride service. This grant was approved with funding available 2016-2019.
Total funding for the project was approved at $530,000. CMAQ funds account for $423,000 and local
funds are committed at $107,000. The City of Superior will contribute the entire local match.
The Superior Call-n-Ride will operate weekdays 5:30am – 7:00pm.
DISCUSSION:
The original Superior Call-n-Ride operated March 2000 – January 2012 and was discontinued due to
low ridership. The City of Superior determined that the Call-n-Ride was instrumental in the
community and submitted the grant application to DRCOG to reestablish the Call-n-Ride.

Construction Amendment for Contract 35 DP003 – Platte Hoist Replacement

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the Interim General Manager to amend contract 35 DP-003 with Precision Construction
Services for an additional $1,687,083, increasing the contract not-to-exceed amount to $2,322,433.
BACKGROUND
The Platte Maintenance and Storage Facility was constructed in 1975 and opened for operations in
December of 1976. The design capacity of the garage was based on 40-foot buses for a total of 250
buses. Currently, the facility supports 260 buses.
There are a total of 15 in-ground hoists within the facility. Original construction did not account for pit
drainage. Over the years, this omission has caused excessive corrosion and has compromised safety. In
addition, the lifts have lived their useful life. All lifts need to be replaced.
DISCUSSION
Bids for the project were received on December 18, 2015. There were four bidders with Precision
Construction Services being low in the amount of $635,350. There are four hoist replacements within
the base bid. This amendment authorization replaces 11 additional hoists for an additional $1,687,083.
The costs were identified within the initial bid therefore assuring RTD a competitive price for this
amendment. These new lifts have the capacity to accommodate various bus dimensions and the scope
also includes adding drains within the pits. With each new lift concrete work is required to construct a
new pit that accommodates the new lift mechanisms. In addition, having all lifts fabricated by the same
manufacturer allows for a more efficient operations and maintenance program.
SBE/DBE INVOLVEMENT
The IFB specified a SBE requirement of 7% of the construction contract. Precision Construction Services
is exceeding the SBE goal for the project and is providing 8% SBE participation.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The funds for the project are 100% local. Approved funds for 2015 and 2016 allows for seven hoists to
be completed by the end of 2016 and totals $1,349,424. The current SBP contains $600,000 for year
2017 and $600,000 for 2018. The eight additional lifts would be amended into the contract pending
Board budget approval for 2017 and 2018.

ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services
Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the Interim General Manager to amend contract

contract not-to-exceed amount to $2,322,433.
2. Do not Accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the Interim General Manager to amend
contract 35 DP-003 with Precision Construction Services for an additional $1,687,083,
increasing the contract not-to-exceed amount to $2,322,433. Do not amend the contract and
complete only the base bid four lifts. Do not continue with the replacement program and attempt
to further maintain the eleven other lifts. This is not recommended as replacement parts are
becoming obsolete.
3. Do not Accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the Interim General Manager to amend
contract 35 DP-003 with Precision Construction Services for an additional $1,687,083,
increasing the contract not-to-exceed amount to $2,322,433. Alternatively, complete the base
bid scope of four lifts and rebid all remaining 11 lifts in 2016 through 2018. This alternative is
not recommended due to the potential of over burdening the operations and maintenance program
by installing lifts from different manufacturers.

Architectural / Engineering Contract with Short
Elliot Hendrickson (SEH), Contract 11 DO-025 Contract Amendment

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the Interim General Manager to amend contract 11 DO-025 with SEH to allow for additional
architectural / engineering design services in the amount of $1,000,000 for a new, not-to-exceed
contract amount of $4,000,000. Work is administered on an as-needed, work order basis. The amended
amount is to be funded by various Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) approved future projects and existing
projects under contract.
BACKGROUND
Services rendered under this contract provide mechanical, civil, architectural, electrical, structural, and
landscaping, design and engineering services for the development of selected projects included in RTD's
SBP program and grant funded projects. The contract duration was specified for a three year term from
October 13, 2011 to October 13, 2014 with award being in the amount of $500,000. Allowable, are
two, one-year extensions to the contract and these extensions have been authorized. This board action
is to increase the existing not-to-exceed limit in the contract. All other terms and conditions of the
contract remain unchanged. Consultant responsibilities include preparation of drawings and
specifications for construction in addition to estimating and other construction related services such as
change order documentation, preparation of as-built drawings, and site inspections. The purpose of this
contract is to assist the Facilities Engineering Division with design services that cannot be completed
with in-house staff.
DISCUSSION
The initial contract amount awarded in October 2011 was $500,000. In May of 2012 the Board
approved an additional $1,500,000 that was based primarily on the Civic Center rehabilitation project. In
December 2013 the Board approved an additional $1,000,000 which anticipated 2014 and 2015 SBP
projects. To date, the contract has obligated $2,982,737 for twenty one projects leaving a contractual
balance of $17,263. Additional funding to the contract is required to accommodate approved 2016 SBP
projects.
SBE/DBE INVOLVEMENT
This contract does not have a SBE/DBE goal. Regardless, the consultant has retained SBE/DBE subconsultants and currently is maintaining a 12.2% participation.

the amount of $1,000,000 for a new, not-to-exceed contract amount of $4,000,000. Work is
administered on an as-needed, work order basis. The amended amount is to be funded by various
Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) approved future projects and existing projects under contract. Not
accepting the recommended action is not recommended because it would delay the schedule of
the approved 2016 SBP projects.
3. Do not Accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the Interim General Manager to amend
contract 11 DO-025 with SEH to allow for additional architectural / engineering design services in
the amount of $1,000,000 for a new, not-to-exceed contract amount of $4,000,000. Work is
administered on an as-needed, work order basis. The amended amount is to be funded by various
Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) approved future projects and existing projects under contract.
Instead, proceed with the implementation of a new Architectural / Engineering RFP for a contract
with a new consultant team. This is not recommended because of the delay it will cause on the
approved 2016 SBP projects.

Construction Award for RFP 14 FH - 050 –
Civic Center Renovation Project.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the Interim General Manager to award a contract to the most qualified proposer, Mortensen
Construction, in the amount of $26,526,319.50 for the Civic Center Renovation project. Additionally,
the Interim General Manager shall be authorized to issue contract amendments within the approved
budget of $30,882,564.
BACKGROUND
Civic Center opened to the public in December 1984 and was built as a part of the 16th Street Mall
project as the south end terminus. The Market Street station was the north end terminus. The original
source of funds were 41% federal and 59% local for a total capital investment of $28,093,307. Routes
that serve the facility are local, limited, regional, and the mall shuttle. Since 2004, both the Maintenance
and Operations Departments have observed degrading conditions of the station. These concerns were
focused on structural and performance elements of the facility which are based on the age of the facility
in addition to original design characteristics.
DISCUSSION
In June of 2011 a report was completed by Merrick & Company that surveyed the facility and made
recommendations for immediate issues, short-term recommendations, and long-term projects. After
reviewing the report and evaluating the estimated costs for repairs it made sense to evaluate the
possibility for an entire replacement. The costs for repairing and keeping the same design were
comparable to redesigning and building a new facility. With a new design there would also be permanent
solutions for problems based on design technology of the late 1970’s. In addition, a new design would
offer solutions to urban design issues that are also considered deficient within the entire site.
With the commitment to redesign the facility and the entire site, RTD held several stakeholder meetings
for site concepts and stakeholder input. The stakeholders included Denver Planning, Denver Parks &
Recreation, Denver Public Works, Downtown Denver Partnership, and the State of Colorado. Goals that
were addressed within the new design are as follows:
1. It gives the option to locate the Free Metro Ride within the station block, upgrades the bus
bays to our current standards to accommodate our current fleet, and gives us some additional
flexibility from a routing and scheduling standpoint.
2. It has a straightforward building structure that will be easier to maintain and repair over the
long term with a smaller more efficient station footprint.

3. It provides a more open and welcoming station environment that is easier to police and
manage, and provides clear visual connections between the mall shuttle, the station, and the
on-street routes at Broadway and Colfax.
4. It preserves a parcel for development opportunities along Colfax.
Due to the complexity and location of the project the decision was made to procure a builder through a
two-phase, qualifications/best value based process. The Request for Qualifications was solicited on
September 10, 2014. The submittals were due on October 17, 2014 and four proposers submitted their
qualifications. They were:
1. Milender White Construction Co.
2. Kiewit Building Group, Inc.
3. PCL Construction
4. Mortensen Construction
All of the proposers were determined to be qualified. The second phase which was the Request for
Proposals was issued on March 27, 2015. Through this RFP process, alternative technical concepts
were solicited. The goal of this process was for RTD to take advantage and own certain technical
concepts that could better the project through means & methods, phasing, logistics, schedule, and cost.
Proposals were due on January 28, 2016. Only two proposals were received. They were from Kiewit
Building Group, Inc. and Mortensen Construction. Both Milender White Construction Co. and PCL
Construction declined to pursue the project. There were thirteen options that were identified within the
scope that were priced separately. Mortensen’s proposed construction duration is 414 calendar days.
Amendment authority of the approved budget for the Interim General Manager is necessary to ensure
schedule adherence. Any unforeseen obstructions will need to be handled in an expeditious manner to
minimize delays as all patrons will be utilizing street-side bus stops without shelters throughout the
construction period.

Call-n-Ride Comments:
Ridership is down. As previously mentioned, a new Call-n-Ride policy went into effect in 2015
regarding how school children were scheduled for rides. In the past, a ride scheduled from a school
for one child, had other children getting on the bus all going in the same direction. This practice
evolved to the point where the Call-n-Ride bus was scheduled at the school by RTD staff rather than
an individual. While this approach provided a reliable service for the children and good ridership
numbers for certain Call-n-Rides, it created a safety issue of having too many children on the bus at
one time. The policy implemented for the start of the fall school service was to have parents book
their children’s rides. This new policy resulted in frustrated parents calling in more complaints and
less children using the service. This change with the drop in gas prices has resulted in ridership
going down in all but 4 Call-n-Rides.
All Call-n-Rides operate with a computer and scheduling software. The current computers in use are
old and this affects our Call-n-Ride operations. New computers have been ordered and are
anticipated to be on board in May 2016.

1.C.1

Belmar – The Belmar Call-n-Ride began operating in April 2013 with the opening of the West Line
Light Rail service. The Call-n-Ride operated with 2 peak vehicles and one all day vehicle, weekdays
only. Over the past two years, the service has been changed in order to gain more ridership as it
does not meet the minimum of three boardings per hour. The RTD Board approved discontinuance of
this Call-n-Ride in April 2016.
Evergreen – A strong Call-n-Ride over the years, there are two major factors in the decline of
ridership: a school closed whose students rode CnR and the Extension program for the disabled
moved and acquired their own bus. We have met with the Seniors’ Resources Center (SRC) and
they have been actively working with the senior living communities and the schools to increase
ridership. A Transportation Advisory Committee (TAC) was formed to evaluate the service and make
recommendations for change. As a direct result of the TAC, marketing has taken place, a shopping
trip created for the seniors and Call-n-Ride worked more with the school age children for school trips.
At the end of 2015, the shopping trip was discontinued but marketing continues.
Highlands Ranch - This CnR opened with the Southeast Corridor in November 2006. Highlands
Ranch CnR replaced the poorly performing Rte 426 Ranch Rider. Over the years RTD has tried
numerous adjustments to the service area and marketing. It has been recommended to be
discontinued twice. Highlands Ranch has carried a high percentage of Access-a-Ride qualified users.
While the subsidy is high for the CnR, if CnR were to be discontinued, this ridership would move to
Access-a-Ride where the subsidy would be much higher. Douglas County has contributed financially
to the CnR in the past. In 2015 Douglas County and Highlands Ranch will cost share with the RTD
for 50% of the subsidy. A TAC was formed to reevaluate service and marketing to increase
ridership. The TAC has come up with some ideas that were implemented in the August 2015
runboard.
Parker – This CnR opened with the Southeast Corridor in November 2006. Over the years RTD has
made adjustments to the service area and marketing. It has been recommended to be discontinued
twice. In 2015 Douglas County and the Town of Parker will cost share with the RTD for 50% of the
subsidy. A TAC was formed to reevaluate service and marketing to increase ridership. The TAC has
come up with some ideas that were implemented in the August 2015 runboard.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, Interim General Manager and
CEO

Date: March 9, 2016

From:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

March 8, 2016

Board Meeting Date: March 22, 2016

Subject:

Access-a-Ride/Cab 4th Quarter Update

Listed below is an update of the key performance indicators for the Access-a-Ride and Access-a-Cab
programs for the 4th quarter of 2015.
Ridership
Access-a-Ride ridership increased by 3% through the 4th quarter of 2015 compared to the same period of
2014. Productivity decreased from 1.22 to 1.21 passengers per hour. During the same period, Accessa-Cab ridership decreased by 5%. Combined Access-a-Ride and Access-a-Cab ridership increased by 1%
compared to 2014. Total boardings increased from 899,325 total boardings thru Q4 of 2014 to
908,467 total boardings thru Q4 of 2015.
Revenue Hours
Revenue hours of service provided on Access-a-Ride increased by 4% during the 4th quarter of 2015 as
compared to the same period of 2014. Access-a-Ride is approximately 3% under budgeted revenue
hours through the fourth quarter of 2015.
On-Time Performance
Carrier on-time performance through the 4th quarter of 2015 was 95.31% a slight increase as compared
to the same period of 2014 (94.93).
Passenger on-time performance through the 4th quarter of 2015 was 83.75% a slight decrease as
compared to the same period in 2014 (83.94%).
On time performance continues to be challenging as a result of operator shortages and the continuing
trend of traffic, construction, and other delays. Our private contractors continue to address the operator
shortage challenge by continuing to utilize radio ads, job fairs, referral bonuses, and internet job sites as
a means of attracting potential operators. In addition, our dedicated vehicle service providers have
instituted salary increases and bonuses in order to attract additional operators.
Customer Complaints
Access-a-Ride complaints increased 25% through the 4th quarter of 2015 as compared to the same
period in 2014. Many of the high complaint categories are related to the current operator shortages.
Access-a-Cab complaints decreased 30% through the 4th quarter of 2015 compared to the same period
in 2014. Staff continues to work with our carriers and passengers to improve overall customer
satisfaction.

Contracted Fixed-Route Quarterly Report – 4th
Quarter 2015

Information

The following is a discussion of the performance measures for the fourth quarter of 2015 for the fixedroute services provided by private contractors:


PREVENTABLE VEHICLE ACCIDENTS PER 100,000 MILES
The contractors, individually and as a group, met the target of ≤ 2.0 Preventable Vehicle
Accidents per 100,000 miles in the 4th quarter. First Transit and Transdev continue to utilize
bus operator monitoring technology and post-accident investigations for retraining of operators.
The contractors continue to emphasize safety with all employees at monthly safety meetings,
through periodic campaigns, and with daily reminders at their facilities.



PASSENGER ACCIDENT RATIO PER 100,000 MILES
The contractors, as a group, met the target of ≤ 0.18 Passenger Accidents per 100,000 miles in
the 4th quarter. First Transit Commerce City did not meet the goal; however, all two of the First
Transit Commerce City passenger accidents that occurred in the 4th quarter were classified as
non-preventable. First Transit and Transdev continue to raise awareness of passenger safety to
reduce the number of passenger accidents per 100,000 miles.



ON-TIME PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE INSPECTIONS
The contractors, individually and as a group, met the target of 98% of Preventive Maintenance
Inspections completed as scheduled in the 4th quarter. RTD and the contractor organizations
place a high emphasis on completing preventive maintenance inspections as required, and as
such, the local operations are diligent about completing these inspections on time.



ON-TIME PERFORMANCE
Transdev, First Transit Denver, and First Transit Longmont met the target of 88% Local On-Time
Service with 88.3% and 88.4% and 88.3% on-time performance respectively in the 4th quarter.
First Transit Commerce City improved during 4th quarter and achieved 83.8% on-time
performance. RTD and the private contractors continue to campaign routes and operators with
low on time performance with a strong focus on first time point departures. On a monthly basis
contractors review the OTP report and meet with operators of low performing routes to discuss
factors that are impacting their ability to reach 88% on time performance. Running time issues
are forwarded to RTD Service Planning and Scheduling for review.
The contractors will continue to address on-time performance issues with operators, but always
tie safety to the discussion. It’s better to be a few minutes late than to have an accident.

1.C.3



MILES BETWEEN LOST SERVICE ROAD CALLS
The contractors, individually and as a group, exceeded the target of 26,000 Miles Between Lost
Service Maintenance Road Calls in the 4th quarter. The contractors continue to improve in this
area by completing preventive maintenance inspections on time, working off defects in a timely
manner, monitoring repeat issues, providing additional training for mechanics, and taking a proactive approach to maintaining the buses in their fleets.



OPERATOR COMPLAINTS PER BOARDING
First Transit Longmont met the target of .0004 Complaints per Boarding with .0003 complaints
per boarding in the 4th quarter. First Transit Commerce City, First Transit Denver, and Transdev
did not meet the goal and all achieved .0006 complaints per boarding in the 4th quarter. The
contractors continue to investigate and address customer complaints with operators. The
contractors utilize onboard video surveillance as a coaching tool to assist operators in improving
customer interactions. In addition, the steps noted above regarding on-time performance should
help address some customer complaints. The contractors also continue to address complaint
trends with all operators at monthly safety meetings.

Analysis

4th

Quarter

Recapped below is an analysis of the customer complaint trends for the 4th Quarter of 2015. Also
included is a comparison of customer complaint data for the same period in 2014.
As noted in previous reports, in 2007 and 2008, RTD and the private contractors were meeting the
performance goal for customer complaints of .0002 complaints per passenger boarding. In 2009, RTD
began stricter enforcement of the fare policy and the priority seating area policy which advised
passengers with strollers or other large items that they would need to move from the priority seating
area if those seats were needed for disabled passengers. In addition, RTD posted notices on all buses
and light rail vehicles advising passengers of the requirement under Title VI of the Civil Rights Law for
operators to call out transfer points. Following the implementation of these policies/procedures,
customer complaints increased, but for 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 RTD and the private contractors
performed, for the most part, at a level of .0003 to .0004 complaints per passenger boarding. In 2012,
the performance goal for passenger complaints was adjusted to .0003 complaints per passenger
boarding. The goal for 2014 was again adjusted to account for the static higher level of complaints due
to the securement area/priority seating issues, the fare enforcement campaigns, TIC availability,
introduction of SmartCards, and the new West Line service. The goal for 2015 remains at .0004
complaints per passenger boarding.
For the 4th Quarter of 2015, RTD and First Transit Longmont met the goal of .0004 complaints per
passenger boarding. First Transit Commerce City, First Transit Denver and Transdev (formerly Veolia)
had .0006 complaints per passenger boarding. The combined performance for all of the private
contractors was .0005 complaints per passenger boarding. The combined performance for RTD and the
private contractors was .0004 complaints per passenger boarding.
RTD staff, as well as the private contractors, monitor and address customer complaints on a daily basis.
RTD and the private contractors investigate all customer complaints using a variety of tools, including
CAD/AVL “flashbacks” and video review and address/discipline operators as needed. Many times the
results of the investigation reveal that the complaint is not valid. Some of the reasons for the “Not
Valid” classification include the following:
Bus was on time (between 1 min early to 5 min late) per “flashback”
Operator followed proper procedure
Passenger presented insufficient fare
Passenger had no proof of eligibility for a discounted fare
Passenger presented an expired transfer
Passenger presented a counterfeit pass
Buses were running late District-wide due to weather
There was no video evidence to support the complaint

1.C.4

RTD and the private contractors continue to work collectively in a variety of different areas to address
customer complaints.
 Bus routes with poor on-time performance are monitored by both RTD and private contractor
personnel to determine if the problem is related to the operator or the running time of the route.
 Meetings are held on a monthly basis with contractor and RTD personnel to discuss challenges,
solutions and best practices in the areas of bus maintenance, operations, safety and training.
 Bus operator trainers from RTD and the private contractors meet weekly in an effort to ensure
consistency in training messages and practices and produce a quarterly newsletter which is
shared with operations personnel.
 RTD is conducting refresher training for all operators on an annual basis, and a component of the
training is customer service. The private contractors conduct mandatory monthly safety meetings
wherein they discuss customer service issues and provide suggestions for improving passenger
interactions.
 RTD and private contractor trainers spend time at Civic Center Station and Denver Union Station
the first week of each runboard to provide assistance to operators who may need some
refreshers on station procedures or have questions on their routes.
 RTD has also reached out to the disability community (Colorado School of the Blind, Atlantis,
DRMAC Transit Accessibility Task Force) to get feedback on ways to improve RTD service for
passengers with disabilities.
 Operators are recognized for the good customer service they provide. Divisions post
commendations on a bulletin board in the drivers’ room and some provide additional means of
recognition.
Historically, and in 2015, the following complaint categories generated the highest number of customer
complaints:
Bus Did Not Show
Bus Early
Bus Late
Careless Driving/Operator
Discourtesy/Operator
Improper Procedure by Operator
Passed Up Passenger at Stop
All of these complaint categories are what RTD considers “operator related” and are included in the
complaint numbers that are tracked and reported to the Board of Directors on the Quarterly Performance
Report.
The high complaint categories are routinely reviewed to determine the factors, both internal and
external, that are impacting the number of complaints. The input received from both RTD and private
contractor operations is noted below:
Bus Did Not Show – 4th Quarter 2015: the complaints in this category increased 25.9% compared to
the same period in 2014. In the last three months of 2015, due to operator shortages at both RTD and
the private contractors, a high number of trips were either dropped or ran late. Consequently, a number
of passengers experienced times when their bus did not show. The YTD average in this category for
2015 is 6.03 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2014 was 4.79 complaints per day.
Bus Early – 4th Quarter 2015: complaints in this category increased 7.3% compared to the same period
in 2014. “Flashbacks” for “bus early” complaints often show buses running late. It is possible
passengers see the prior bus running late and will assume it is their bus running early. Operators are

Packet Pg. 64

1.C.4

addressed whenever the CAD/AVL playback confirms that the bus was running ahead of schedule. The
YTD average in this category for 2015 is 5.52 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2014
was 5.15 complaints per day.
Bus Late – 4th Quarter 2015: complaints in this category increased 2.0 % compared to the same period
in 2014. This category was also impacted by the operator shortages. Additionally, improving on-time
performance continues to be a challenge for a variety of reasons including construction, traffic and
heavy ridership delays; service reductions, which result in the same number of passengers on fewer
trips; and the inability to fund service improvements to address running-time issues. The YTD average in
this category for 2015 is 12.63 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2014 was 12.38
complaints per day.
Careless Driving/Operator – 4th Quarter 2015: complaints in this category increased 11.4% compared to
the same period in 2014. On a regular basis, video recordings are reviewed and undercover ride checks
are performed to determine if operators are driving in an unsafe or inappropriate manner. In addition,
RTD and the private contractors have “G-force activated” event-recording systems (Drive Cam, Smart
Drive) installed on the buses. These incidents are also reviewed on a daily basis. Operators continue to
be counseled and retrained as needed to improve driving performance. Also, periodic safety campaigns
are conducted to reinforce safe driving habits. The YTD average in this category for 2015 is 5.13
complaints per day. The comparable number for 2014 was 4.60 complaints per day.
Discourtesy/Operator – 4th Quarter 2015: complaints in this category increased 5.4% compared to the
same period in 2014. In the majority of cases, video evidence confirms that the operator followed
proper procedures and treated the customer with respect. In many cases, operators are shown
enforcing or explaining policies (requesting proper fare payment, requesting space in the priority seating
area, addressing inappropriate behavior) in a polite and respectful manner and the passengers react in a
negative manner. Operators are counseled and disciplined if video evidence confirms that they treated
passengers in a discourteous or inappropriate manner. Operators are also given suggestions for handling
similar situations in the future. The YTD average in this category for 2015 is 11.60 complaints per day.
The comparable number for 2014 was 11.0 complaints per day.
Discrimination – 4th Quarter 2015: complaints in this category remained the same as the same period in
2014. Investigation into discrimination-related complaints usually shows the operator not at fault. The
YTD average in this category for 2015 is 0.32 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2014
was 0.32 complaints per day.
Fare Dispute –4th Quarter 2015: complaints in this category decreased 3.4% compared to the same
period in 2014. It appears passengers have come to accept the fact that operators are expecting fares
to be paid upon boarding. Investigations into “fare dispute” complaints often show that passengers
presented an improper/incomplete fare and are not happy with the operators’ enforcement of the fare
policies. The YTD average in this category for 2015 is 1.08 complaints per day. The comparable
number for 2014 was 1.12 complaints per day.
Improper Procedure/Operator – 4th Quarter 2015: complaints in this category increased 2.1% compared
to the same period in 2014. RTD and private contractor training and operations personnel meet on a
regular basis to ensure all operators are receiving consistent and up-to-date information. In addition, the
on-going refresher training provided to RTD operators and the monthly safety meetings held at the
private contractor divisions provide operators with information about accommodating the needs of RTD
passengers to the best of their abilities. In cases where video evidence shows operators are not

Packet Pg. 65

1.C.4

following proper procedures, appropriate action is taken. The YTD average in this category for 2015 is
8.13 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2014 was 7.96 complaints per day.
Incorrect Info/Operator – 4th Quarter 2015: complaints in this category increased 1.3% compared to the
same period in 2014. The combined efforts of the General Superintendent of Transportation, the Bus
Operator Training Newsletter Team, Street Supervisors and Dispatchers are providing operators with upto-date information to answer customer questions and address customer concerns. The YTD average in
the category for 2015 is 0.44 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2014 was 0.43
complaints per day.
Passed Up Passenger At Stop – 4th Quarter 2015: complaints in this category increased 6.2%
compared to the same period in 2014. In many cases, “flashbacks” for these complaints will confirm
buses are on route and either on time or running late. It is possible the passenger was not directly at the
stop when the bus arrived. Many complaint comments indicate the passenger was running to the stop
as the bus passed. Operators are reminded to stay vigilant and watch for passengers that may not be
waiting directly at the bus stop. In addition, operators are directed to contact RTD Dispatch whenever a
passenger is passed up due to the bus being full. The number of “Pass Up” complaints from passengers
with disabilities and/or those using mobility aids represents a small number of the total “Pass Up”
complaints (163 of the total 4,248 = 3.8%). Information regarding overcrowded routes is forwarded to
the Service Planning & Scheduling Department for review and adjustment as needed and as resources
will allow. The YTD average in this category for 2015 is 11.64 complaints per day. The comparable
number for 2014 was 10.96 complaints per day.

Customer Satisfaction Survey
Although customer complaints help identify those areas in which RTD and the private contractors can
continue to improve the quality of service provided, the results of the 2011 Customer Satisfaction
Survey indicate that the majority of RTD passengers are satisfied with RTD services. On a scale of 1
(poor) to 5 (excellent), over 80% of bus, light rail, Call-n-Ride, and SkyRide passengers rated RTD either
a 4 or a 5.
Specific driver related areas that received ratings of 4.0 or higher were as follows:
Courtesy of bus driver
Driving skills
Drivers’ knowledge of their specific route
Drivers’ ability to answer your questions about bus service
Drivers announcing transfer stops

4th Quarter 2015 Security Statistics & Fare
Inspection Summary

Information

DISCUSSION:
Fare Enforcement Statistics
Fare inspectors, security officers, street supervisors, and police officers, conduct fare inspection onboard buses and light rail vehicles. RTD’s policy is to provide a warning to first time offenders and then
to issue a citation if that person is contacted a second time without fare. The table below shows the
actual number of patrons without fare that resulted in warnings or citations. The variation in numbers
from month to month may be due to several factors: special events or other security security-related
incidents.

Light Rail Station Sweeps and on-Board Enforcement Sweeps
In addition to the regular on-board fare enforcement, security officers conduct random, unannounced
fare checks at light rail platforms twice a week. Below are the numbers of patrons contacted during the
quarter. Any area that exhibits a higher fare evasion rate, we go back to that area and conduct an onboard enforcement sweep.

Plain Clothes Police Officer Fare Inspection
Police Officers are placed on bus and rail vehicles that have been identified by operators, supervisors,

Arrests include citations issued or physical arrests made for criminal violations other than fare evasion.
This is an additional advantage to the plain clothes police fare inspection program as peace officers have
the authority to check for warrants and take the appropriate law enforcement action. This quarter the
bus routes inspected include the 15, 16, 31 & 0.

The below chart shows the plain clothes police fare enforcement observations for light rail. There is a
slightly higher fare evasion rate observed by the plain clothes program than for the rail station sweeps
and bus enforcement because of the following factors:
 Fare station sweeps are conducted by uniformed security officers; these officers require all
patrons to have fare before boarding vehicles
 Rail operators do not have any interface with patrons, while bus operators do ask for fare
 Plain clothes police officers do not have a deterrence factor as uniformed officers, thus they
inherently find more violations of fare evasion.

Security Officer Use of Force Incidents
Use of Force is defined as any hands on touching of a suspect by a security officer to detain a suspect
or make a citizen’s arrest. The majority of these issues are minor in nature. No injuries to any suspect

Resolution Expressing the intent of the
Board to be reimbursed for certain expenses
relating to the financing of the FasTracks
Project

CFO/AGM,

&

Board Meeting Date: March 29, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Resolution”), expressing the intent of the Board to
be reimbursed for certain expenses relating to the financing of the FasTracks Project.
BACKGROUND:
The FasTracks financial plan anticipates a 2016 FasTracks bond issuance for approximately $150
million to finance certain components of the FasTracks projects including the District’s Southeast Rail
Extension (SERE) project, I-225, North Metro, Longmont Station, EAGLE and US 36 BRT, Phase 2.
Related costs of issuance of the bonds are also anticipated to be financed through these bonds.
DISCUSSION:
In anticipation of fully funding the SERE project in 2016, certain preliminary expenses are being
incurred today such as right of way acquisition and final design work to facilitate a quick start to the
project once all funding is in place. In order for these preliminary SERE expenses and ongoing
expenses of the other projects listed above to be reimbursed by a future FasTracks bond issuance, a
reimbursement resolution such as the one being recommended must be adopted by the Board.
Once the Federal Small Starts Construction Grant for the SERE project is fully secured, the Chief
Financial Officer will take preliminary actions to arrange for the issuance of FasTracks bonds,
including assembling financial information related to the District and drafting preliminary documents
and a Resolution for issuance of the Bonds. Drafts of these documents and the Resolution
authorizing issuance of the 2016 FasTracks bonds will be brought to the Board for consideration at a
future time.
The Board is being requested, through this Resolution, to express the intent of the Board to be
reimbursed for certain expenses relating to the financing of the FasTracks Project through the future
issuance of FasTracks Bonds.

Packet Pg. 77

2.B.1

RTD is receiving the advice of Butler Snow as Bond Counsel in regard to this reimbursement
resolution.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
Principal and interest costs related to the 2016 issuance of FasTracks Bonds are included in the
budget and the FasTracks financial plan adopted by the Board in August 2015.
ALTERNATIVES:
1.
Authorize the attached Resolution No. __, Series of 2016, expressing the intent of the
Board to be reimbursed for certain expenses relating to the financing of the FasTracks
Project. This is the recommended action.
2.
Do not authorize the execution of documents, including the attached Resolution No. __, Series
of 2016, expressing the intent of the Board to be reimbursed for certain expenses relating to
the financing of the FasTracks Project. This is not the recommended action as it would
adversely affect RTD’s ability to proceed with FasTracks projects.

A RESOLUTION EXPRESSING THE INTENT OF THE
BOARD TO BE REIMBURSED FOR CERTAIN EXPENSES

WHEREAS, it is the current intent of the Board of Directors (the

arranges for the specific financing of such Project; and
WHEREAS, it is the Board’s reasonable expectation that when such
financing occurs, the capital expenditures will be reimbursed with the proceeds of
the financing; and
WHEREAS, in order to comply with the provisions of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), it is the Board’s desire that this
resolution shall constitute the “official intent” of the Board to reimburse such
capital expenditures within the meaning of Treasury Regulation §1.150-2.

resolution shall for any reason be held invalid or unenforceable, the invalidity or
unenforceability of such section, paragraph, clause or provision shall not affect any
of the remaining provisions of this resolution.

DISCUSSION
Attached is the Performance Report for the Fourth Quarter of 2015. These year-to-date measures
provide a framework in which RTD determines how well it provides service to its passengers and
the citizens of the District within its mission statement objectives. Of the 23 performance
measures tracked, RTD met 17 of the goals in their entirety in the third quarter compared to 17 in
the third quarter. The following is a discussion of the exceptions.
Goal 1.1 – Safety Incidents
First Transit-Commerce City was the only carrier to not meet goal in Q4 in the passenger accident
ratio per 100,000 miles. All of the passenger accidents were non-preventable.
Goal 3.1 – System-Wide On-Time Performance
The District as a whole did not meet its goals for on-time service in Q4; performance is stable to
Q3 and on a full-year basis improved over prior year 2014. In Local on-time service, all carriers
met goal except RTD Local and First Transit-Commerce City. Regional & Express on-time service
showed improvement over Q3. Staff will continue its targeted efforts in studying the worst
performing routes and identifying the resources needed to improve, such as service changes and
operator training.
Light Rail on-time service was stable compared to Q3 and 2014.
Goal 4.2 – Level of Customer Complaints
This measure showed a slightly higher level of complaints in Q4 over Q3. Overall system
complaints met goal, but individually, three carriers did not. We have seen customer complaints
increase across the entire system over the past few years due to several factors including the fare
enforcement campaign, the stroller policy, heavy/longer load times, TIC availability, SmartCards,
and lost service arising from the inability to staff all routes due to operator shortages. Staff
continues to review CAD/AVL playbacks to determine the validity of these complaints and to work
with operators to address the valid issues.
In Q4, RTD and First Transit-Longmont met or exceeded goal while First Transit-Commerce City,
Transdev and First Transit-Denver did not meet goal. Staff provides an analysis of complaints as
part of the Operations/Customer Services report.

Packet Pg. 89

2.C.2

5.1 – ADA On-Time Performance
Access-a-Ride on-time service was only slightly down from Q3, again mostly due to challenges in
operator hiring.
Goal 6.2 – Increase Ridership
Ridership in Q4 was down almost 2%. Ridership goal is 0% increase for 2015. Ridership actuals
compared to budget will continue to be evaluated.
Goal 6.5 – Bus Operator/Mechanic Headcount within Authorization
RTD exceeded its vacancies goal in bus operators and bus mechanics. We are experiencing a high
level of vacancies in this category and recruitment is on-going. Human Resources has revised its
hiring practices to include signing and referral bonuses, “one-stop” job fairs, the use of outside
agencies, and advertising. Vacancies are due to retirements, system growth, and the strong local
economy. Bus operator vacancies are declining and we expect an improvement in mechanics
vacancies going forward due to successful hiring at end of year.

The measure was increased in 2013 to ≤6.0 due to the addition of the West Line which added 30% to the overall system
and 25 more grade-crossings coupled with limited history on the new line.

CFO/AGM,

Finance

&

Board Meeting Date: March 22, 2016
Information

BACKGROUND
A Fiscal Sustainability Task Force (Task Force) was formed in November 2010 for the purpose of making
recommendations detailing opportunities for operating efficiencies and revenue enhancement for the
Base System to ensure RTD’s long-term fiscal sustainability. The Task Force consisted of 22 members
with 12 of those members being external to RTD.
The Task Force presented its written
recommendations to the Board of Directors in June 2011. The Board of Directors subsequently
approved those recommendations and directed Staff to pursue implementation of each recommendation.
The Task Force reconvened for a final meeting in July 2012 to be briefed on the progress of their
recommendations and provide an opportunity for feedback.
DISCUSSION
The Task Force made revenue enhancement, expense reduction and fiscal policy recommendations to
the Board of Directors which were approved for further consideration and/or implementation. The
majority of the recommendations made have been completed or their status has not changed since our
last report in October 2015. We continue to report on the status of the Task Force recommendations as
follows:
Recommendations - Completed
Removing the Volatility from Sales and Use Tax Projections
RTD contracted with the University of Colorado, Leeds School of Business – Business Research Division
(Leeds) to provide sales and use tax forecasts beginning in March 2011. Each quarter, Leeds has
provided a forecast containing short-term (one year by quarter), medium-term (six year SBP period) and
long-term (30 year APE period) sales and use tax projections. This was implemented to provide RTD
with expert economic analysis and sales and use tax forecasts using sophisticated financial modeling
techniques not available internally. These forecasts are intended to provide a better analysis of RTD’s
expected sales and use tax collections which comprise approximately 2/3 of RTD’s recurring revenues.
For 2016, the CU contract was renewed for semi-annual forecasts rather than quarterly.
Service Optimization
In 2012, RTD implemented modifications and reductions in service representing approximately $10.7
million or an 8% net reduction in service. Service optimization was recommended by the Task Force and
implemented with Board approval in order to match services provided with available funding sources.
Since that time, service has been gradually restored as needed within budgetary constraints. Service
modifications were brought forward to accommodate the new FasTracks lines opening in 2016 and we
will continue to assess service optimization.

Packet Pg. 102

2.C.3

Fund Balance Policy
Due to the volatility of RTD’s largest single revenue source, sales and use taxes, the Task Force
recommended implementation of a more robust fiscal policy regarding fund balances. Fund balances
represent financial assets that are available to RTD after allowing for obligations that have been incurred.
Fund balances increase when fund sources exceed fund uses and vice versa. Fund balances, therefore,
exist as a form of savings account to be used for specific purposes when needed and replenished when
economic circumstances allow. In response to this recommendation, RTD implemented a fund balance
policy with a target level of $90 million for the Base System, which is approximately three months of
operating expenses. The target fund balance for FasTracks is two months of operating expenses (with
the third month contributed to FISA). These targets were established based on levels recommended by
the Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA) best practices. The Fund Balance Policy further
categorizes the available fund balances into the categories of a Board Restricted Fund, a Capital
Replacement Fund and an Unrestricted Fund. At FYE 12/31/15, preliminary fund balances (net of Net
Pension Obligation and prior to audit adjustments) totaled $78.9 million on the Base system.
Sales and Use Tax Exemptions
In Colorado, legislation establishes products and services that are subject to sales and use taxation and
those that are exempt from taxation. The state, cities, municipalities and special districts in Colorado
each have different sales and use tax rates and often have differing items subject to taxation due to
legislation establishing exemptions. Exemption parity was identified by the Task Force as providing a
benefit to RTD during difficult economic conditions when the state implements exemption changes and
vice versa. In addition, exemption parity removes the complexity to vendors of RTD having different
taxable items than the state. RTD introduced legislation that was passed in May 2013 to establish
parity with the state regarding items subject to sales and use taxation. Exemption parity took effect
1/1/14. RTD estimates that parity generated a net increase of $2.7 million in 2014 based on 2012
figures, however, this is difficult to track due to the way vendors report sales tax components.
Technology and Energy Innovation
RTD conducted a comprehensive energy audit of the oldest and largest operating division (the Platte
facility) to determine the potential scope of savings that may be available through equipment and lighting
upgrades. The audit identified that facility lighting upgrades could result in potentially significant energy
savings. Areas for minor energy savings were identified for other building systems; however, these have
a very significant capital investment and long pay-back periods. RTD budgets for energy upgrades
throughout the District in the Strategic Budget Plan. We will continue to address energy efficiency in
building systems as on-going projects are completed. Facilities Maintenance has completed lighting
upgrades by replacing older metal-halide fixtures with more energy-efficient fluorescent fixtures at the
East Metro, Boulder, District Shops and Platte operating facilities. Solar panels were also installed at the
East Metro facility. Average savings of approximately $50,000 annually have occurred at the East
Metro facility due to the combination of solar and lighting upgrades. The Boulder facility is remaining
even in costs since the lighting upgrades occurred. District Shops is saving $20,000 annually and the
Platte Division is saving over $50,000 annually.
Sales and Use Tax Compliance Reviews
The Colorado Department of Revenue (DOR) collects and audits sales and use taxes for RTD. The Task
Force identified an opportunity for revenue enhancement by performing additional sales and use tax
compliance reviews based on the favorable collection experiences of Colorado cities and municipalities
that implemented these reviews. Compliance reviews consist of RTD providing additional resources
from a contracted provider to supplement the DOR’s audit function and is intended to provide the DOR
with the additional resources necessary to ensure complete and timely tax compliance by vendors. RTD
contracted with Revenue Recovery Group (RRG), an audit firm with substantial experience providing

Packet Pg. 103

2.C.3

compliance review services to several Colorado municipalities, and the program began in April 2014.
While assessments from this effort have exceeded the costs, it has not yet been determined to what
extent those assessments will be collected. RTD staff decided not to extend RRG’s contract beyond
December 31, 2015 due to the limited remaining opportunities for assessments outside of the scope of
work of the DOR.
Recommendations – Ongoing
Naming Rights
In August, the RTD Board approved the first naming rights/corporate sponsorship agreement under the
Board-adopted naming rights policy with the University of Colorado for naming the commuter rail A Line
and creating an advertising presence on the Flatiron Flyer bus rapid transit line. In return, RTD will
receive from the University of Colorado total gross payments of $5 million over the next five years, less
implementation costs and commission, with a possible five year extension if both parties agree. By way
of background, RTD’s naming rights consultant WME/IMG presented to the Board in 2013 an inventory
and financial analysis of RTD facilities, services, and assets that could lend themselves to
naming/sponsorship value-added contracts. WME/IMG completed the valuation of RTD assets and was
given the green light to begin pursuing potential clients, resulting in the public launch of the program in
the third quarter of 2014. Any additional proposed naming rights/corporate sponsorship contracts will
continue to be brought to the RTD Board for approval.
Partnerships and Privatization
The Task Force described this recommendation as a broad area that could include items such as
privatizing routes and administrative and operational functions to reduce expenses. RTD has undertaken
some actions under this recommendation such as the lease of the DUS historic building, IGAs for
improvements to US36 and the East Line, as well as TOD activities. RTD continues to look for
partnership and privatization opportunities on an ongoing basis. RTD has received an unsolicited
proposal regarding its parking facilities that may present further opportunities for working with the
private sector.
Recommendations – Low Priority
The status of recommendations made by the Task Force and categorized at the 2012 Board Retreat as
having lower priority follows:
Charge for Parking
RTD currently charges out-of-District patrons parking fees to use parking facilities as well as fees
charged to in-District patrons parking for longer than 24 hours. The Task Force identified charging
parking fees to all patrons as a possible revenue enhancement source. This recommendation could be
perceived as a fare increase. In 2013, the state legislation regarding RTD charging for parking was
amended to allow a third party to charge in-District patrons as long as RTD receives no revenue.
Tolling and Managed Lanes
The Task Force recommended investigating the possibility of RTD generating additional revenues
through charges for tolling and managed lanes.
Enacting this recommendation would require
coordination with CDOT and other agencies. The US36 BRT project is an example of how tolling and
managed lanes can enhance RTD operations and save costs. The agreement guarantees running times,
allows for bus on shoulder operations to facilitate schedule adherence on local service, and provides for
maintenance of managed lanes with no contribution from RTD. Prior to entering into agreements with
CDOT for managed lanes, RTD contributed to maintenance and snow removal on the I-25 HOV lanes.

Packet Pg. 104

2.C.3

Home Rule Initiative
The Task Force recommended that RTD consider becoming a “Home Rule” entity which would allow
RTD to collect and audit its sales and use taxes instead of the DOR. This initiative would require
legislation. RTD met several times with the DOR to discuss this initiative as well as sales and use tax
compliance reviews. Although the DOR did not object to RTD performing these services itself, the
Colorado Municipal League and other entities recommended against it. “Home Rule” is a state
constitutional authorization for creating municipalities. It could only be secured for RTD by statewide
constitutional amendment. As discussed earlier in this report, RTD has entered into an agreement with
DOR to facilitate better tax compliance and monitoring, which has been coupled with simplification of
state and RTD taxation through legislation that provides for uniformity on items taxed.

Board Meeting Date: March 22, 2016

BACKGROUND
The 2016 Summary Budget Calendar is structured to provide the Board the opportunity to offer
early, substantive input into the development of the RTD Annual Budget. The purpose of the
attached calendar is to assist Board members in anticipating and planning their input into the
development of the 2016 Amended Budget, 2017-2022 Strategic Budget Plan (SBP), and the 2017
Budget. The General Manager’s strategic goals developed by the Board at the March 5 Board
Strategic Advance meeting will be incorporated into the 2017 Budget plans.
DISCUSSION
In the course of the development of the three financial plans mentioned above, staff will look to the
Board to provide guidance and collaboration in:
(1) 2016 Amended Budget and proposed FasTracks multi-year project approval
(2) Determining the objectives of the 2017 Budget
(3) Understanding the key drivers of costs in the District’s annual budget
(4) Determining the required adjustments to RTD programs and fund balance levels
(5) Developing an understanding of departmental operating expenses and capital projects
(6) Establishing and adhering to a calendar of critical milestones that make it possible for the
District to satisfy State Statutes relative to budget formation and monitoring
CONCLUSION
The suggested topics and timing in the accompanying calendar are proposed with the intent of
keeping the Board informed on critical budget information as it becomes available and allowing the
Board to develop an understanding of the key financial plans. Staff is seeking the support of the
Board in moving ahead with this plan.

Board Meeting Date: March 22, 2016
Information

The Stored Value MyRide Card is a product that can be purchased by the general public currently
enrolled in the pubic pilot program to pay for transit fares on fixed route buses and rail platforms. Stored
Value is provided on reloadable plastic cards encoded with chips. These cards can be loaded with certain
dollar amounts and used much like a debit card. Once the card is loaded, it can be used to board bus or
rail until the dollar amount on the card is less than the fare needed. Additional value can be loaded onto
the card at RTD retail outlets.
Starting the morning of Monday January 4th, cards were being dispersed to the Public Pilot Riders at the
RTD retail outlets. For the first nine-weeks and as of March 6th, a total of 1,005 cards were issued of
which 760 (76%) were full fare and 245 (24%) were discount cards. The average initial stored value
loading is $43.58 with a total value loaded of $63,900. There have been 13,060 boardings using these
MyRide cards with fare value of $27,900. Of these boardings; 73% were local, 26% regional and 1%
airport.

REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
VIRTEGIC GROUP
AUDIT REPORT # 15-11-12

RTD issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) in an effort to hire a Public Information (PI)
Consultant during the third quarter of 2011, following the expiration of the original PI
Consultant contract. After evaluating responses from interested firms, Virtegic Group
was chosen and entered into a ‘fixed price labor hours, time and materials’ contract with
RTD that expires later this year.
Based on the original bid proposal, if all option years were exercised, the total cost for
Virtegic’s services would approximate $3.8 million over the five year period. This was
significantly lower than the prior provider’s bid and Virtegic was considered to have the
necessary expertise to fulfill the RFP requirements.
AUDIT SCOPE
The Audit Scope included the initial contract awarding process and monthly invoice
submissions over the last twelve months. Tests were performed to validate that
responding vendors were adequately reviewed and evaluated at RTD; the contract was
properly executed; both RTD and Virtegic are in compliance with the contract terms
and conditions, and monthly invoices are reviewed and approved by appropriate RTD
management.
CONCLUSION
Internal Audit concluded that the most favorable bidder was selected and the contract
was properly executed. Invoices contain the required detail from Virtegic Group
including each assigned employee’s hours charged, and accomplishments for the
month. The monthly invoice packages were approved by appropriate individuals within
RTD before payment. However, Accounts Payable did not maintain the signed Invoice
Routing Slip as evidence of approval with the imaged paid invoice.

Attachment: FAACMarch 2016Attachments (2737 : Internal Audit Report)

BACKGROUND SUMMARY

Finance will convene a ‘working group’ to review the entire invoice routing, approval,
and retention process, in an effort to identify potential efficiencies for all vendors.
CURRENT STATUS
We will review the status of these actions as part of our normal follow-up in 2016.

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT) AUDITING
REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
AUDIT REPORT # 15-06-13

The District had not been involved in IT Audits prior to 2015. On the Suggestion of a
Board Member, Internal Audit obtained permission from the General Manager and CEO
to proceed with the inclusion of IT Audits in the Audit Universe from 2015. This meant
inclusion of an audit on the Annual Audit Plan for 2015. The Audit was of a general
nature. IT Audit is different from Internal Audit as it requires specialized knowledge of IT
systems and controls, which is not needed by Internal Audit.
2015 has been a busy year for Internal Audit as we prepare to stretch our limited time
across both fields. In the spring of 2015 Internal Audit attended a week long IT Audit
School in order to refresh our IT Audit skills. In addition we have joined/rejoined the
Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA) and have acquired the
materials that would assist in performing quality IT Audits for RTD.
Information Technology, Cyber Security conducted a very detailed Risk Assessment in
2014, as part of the planning for future IT Audits Internal Audit reviewed the risk
assessment. Internal Audit also conducted research and prepared a one year IT Audit
Plan for 2016, together with an Audit universe for IT Audits that would be utilized for a
further four years. In doing this we have consulted with the IT Department, the Chair of
the Finance, Accounting and Audit Committee (FAAC) and other IT Audit Professionals.

SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES

The scope included determination of the best process for IT Auditing for RTD. Each IT
audit will have a predetermined scope and an appropriate amount of time will be
allocated to completing it.

Attachment: FAACMarch 2016Attachments (2737 : Internal Audit Report)

BACKGROUND SUMMARY

CONCLUSION

The use of technology in business means that Cyber Security is of utmost importance in
ensuring protection at the right level. Management at all levels need to be involved in
Cyber Security as it is an enterprise-wide risk management issue not just and IT or
Audit issue.

REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
2015 DENVER TRANSIT PARTNERS – DIA
CONTINUOUS MONITORING – INTERIM # 2
AUDIT REPORT # 15-12-15

In early 2007, RTD investigated the option of building two major rail lines using a publicprivate partnership. Significant effort was involved in developing and soliciting a
‘Request for Quotations’ (RFQ) and evaluating the results pertaining to a Design, Build,
Finance, Operate and Maintain Agreement for the East Rail Line to Denver International
Airport.
Denver Transit Partners (DTP) was awarded the contract with the lowest anticipated
cost for the construction phase, and the best overall technical score. Groundbreaking
was initiated in August 2010 and the line is expected to open in April of this current
year. Proposed Change Orders are periodically submitted by DTP for RTD pre-approval
when unplanned circumstances are experienced.
In addition to DTP, RTD contracted directly with Delcan Corporation, a firm hired to
perform ‘Quality Management Oversight Services’ of ongoing FasTracks Construction
efforts. As part of their provided services, Delcan hired a DBE and SBE certified subcontractor, DQP Enterprises, to perform ‘Internal Quality Reviews’ related to
construction activity. DTP and Delcan, both submit monthly invoices to RTD which are
reviewed and approved by various RTD individuals before payment is made to each
respective firm.
SCOPE
Internal Audit performed a limited review of the controls within RTD over both DTP and
Delcan invoice receipt, review, and approval. A sample Change Order from DTP was
also reviewed for adequate controls.
Testing was performed to validate that monthly progress invoices are properly
supported by detailed worksheets. We also ensured that there was evidence of RTD
management review and approval of each invoice package.

Attachment: FAACMarch 2016Attachments (2737 : Internal Audit Report)

BACKGROUND SUMMARY

CONCLUSION
Based on the results of our limited testing, it appears that monthly progress invoices are
adequately supported by DTP and sufficiently reviewed by appropriate RTD employees.
Internal Audit has reported a concern with the high rate of over $200 per hour, charged
in 2015 by DQP Enterprises, the Quality Auditor that operates under Delcan.

RISK ASSESSMENT
REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
AUDIT REPORT #15-12-16

The key to effectively protecting RTD’s assets and ensuring continued success in achieving the
business objectives is to identify and manage RTD’s risks. Identification of risks ensures that
efforts are focused on the risks that have the most significant impact on RTD.
The Risk Assessment:
 Identifies key risks for the organization.
 Allows prioritization of the risks.
 Provides opportunity to determine significance of risks.
 Provides opportunity to determine how risks are to be handled.
 Provides opportunity to determine RTDs Risk Appetite.
 Allows Internal Audit and RTD Management to determine effective use of limited
resources.
Internal Audit developed and delivered a Risk Assessment Survey to all departments, requiring
completion by the Middle of March 2016. The survey is designed to effectively and efficiently
identify the risks perceived by RTD management and staff and at the same time reveal their
determination of significance and likelihood of occurrence.

SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES
The Risk Assessment covers all departments, divisions and sections of RTD. The surveys were
sent to every department for completion. Internal Audit will prepare a final Audit Risk Universe
which will be used to develop future Audit Plans. The information will also be reviewed by the
Senior Leadership Team and updated annually.

CONCLUSION
Risk Assessment is a continuous process. Audit has obtained Management’s agreement,
researched and designed a survey that would capture the required information and distributed
surveys to all departments. We are currently handling questions from departments and are
available for assistance as needed.

Attachment: FAACMarch 2016Attachments (2737 : Internal Audit Report)

BACKGROUND SUMMARY

The next steps involve reviewing survey responses, and classifying risks in a manner that would
be representative of RTD as a whole. The Risk Assessment will then be presented to Senior
Management for confirmation of the determination of significance and likelihood. Management
will then be required to review the information to determine RTD’s risk appetite and the efforts in
mitigating the risks. Risk Assessment is a continuous process. The results of the Risk
Assessment Survey could be used throughout the organization.
This report does not require a response.

BACKGROUND SUMMARY

The Senior Manager of Debt and Investments reports to the CFO/AGM Administration.
One Finance Analyst, Senior position was added in 2015, and reports directly to the
Senior Manager of Debt and Investments. The Investment and Debt Accountant reports
to the Senior Manager of Accounting. The Senior Manager of Debt and Investment and
the Senior Manager of Accounting review the monthly reconciliations prepared by the
Investment and Debt Accountant, to validate accuracy.
AUDIT SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES
This audit is designed to ensure compliance with RTD’s Investment Policy. In order to
cover all aspects of the investment function within the limited time available, audit efforts
are concentrated on different areas annually. The current audit scope included a review
of the organization structure for RTD investment functions, and monthly reconciliations
prepared by the Investment and Debt Accountant were tested for review and approval.
CONCLUSION
Internal controls over investments appear effective and support RTD’s Investment
Policy.
Management has agreed to examine the Senior Manager reviews of the monthly
investment reconciliations, in an effort to streamline the process and ensure adequate
evidence exists. The Investment and Debt Accountant job description will be reviewed
and updated.

Attachment: FAACMarch 2016Attachments (2737 : Internal Audit Report)

RTD has an extensive investment portfolio that is overseen by the Senior Manager of
Debt and Investments, with investment advice and transaction activity provided by PFM

reporting lines so that the Investment and Debt Accountant position reports directly to
the Senior Manager of Debt and Investments for improved efficiency. Internal Audit
continues to support the recommendation.
CURRENT STATUS
We will review the status of the agreed upon corrective actions as part of our normal
follow-up.
