BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

From:

William C. Van Meter,Assistant General
Manager, Planning

Date:

Board Meeting Date: June 3, 2014

Subject:

Approval of NAMS Recommendation

Resolution
RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
approve the attached Resolution, which accepts the Final Consensus Statement as developed by the
Northwest Area Mobility Study stakeholders for priorities within the Northwest Study Area.
Implementation of these priorities will be subject to future Board consideration and approval.
BACKGROUND
In April 2013, RTD initiated the Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS). The purpose of the study
was to develop consensus among RTD, the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) and the
Northwest-area stakeholders, including local jurisdictions and businesses, on cost effective and
efficient mobility improvements to serve the Northwest area. RTD engaged HNTB Corp. to serve as
the lead consultant in March 2013.
The study had five key tasks as described below:
1. Determine how the remaining FasTracks US 36 BRT commitment will be allocated to the corridor
and determine what, if any, BRT elements are needed to achieve full BRT in the corridor;
2. Evaluate the feasibility and determine the cost associated with constructing the Northwest Rail in
segments;
3. Evaluate the possibility for extending the North Metro Corridor from SH 7 to Longmont;
4. Evaluate potential for early implementation mobility improvements in the area, such as arterial
BRT; and
5. Conduct a high-level analysis of the reverse commute issues on the I-25 Downtown Express
lanes.
The study was governed by:
1. A Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), made up of staff members from the northwest area
local jurisdictions, CDOT, DRCOG, the University of Colorado Boulder, 36 Commuting
Solutions and the North Area Transportation Alliance (NATA); and
2. A Policy Advisory Committee, made up of the elected officials from the local jurisdictions, as
well as a representative from CDOT, the 36 Commuting Solutions Board of Directors, NATA
and the RTD Board members representing Districts within the study area (Directors Anderson,
Hoy, Lubow and Sisk).
RTD staff, the consultant and the stakeholders contributed significant input throughout the study.
At the final PAC meeting held on April 18, 2014, the stakeholders came to a consensus on how to

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

move forward with transit improvements in the northwest area. A Consensus Statement was
developed to document the principles and priorities that the stakeholders desired.
DISCUSSION
The Consensus Statement includes a section that discusses general principles and a section which
discusses prioritization of potential projects.
General Principles
The Consensus Statement general principles are as follows:
• An overarching theme serves as a basis from which consensus on the priorities is grounded:
The Northwest area remains committed to Northwest Rail, as envisioned in FasTracks. Given
the projected timing of Northwest Rail’s implementation, the Northwest stakeholders want to
see mobility benefits sooner.
• Projects on this prioritized list should not be considered absolutely sequential. Nothing should
preclude the pursuit or acceleration of any of these priorities should viable opportunities or
partners become available. More than one priority can be pursued simultaneously. RTD
should be proactive, aggressive and creative in monitoring these projects for any significant
developments that help a project move forward, such as public or P3 funding opportunities.
Priorities
The Consensus Statement’s priorities are as follows:
1. Completion of the Remaining US 36 BRT Commitments – These are the commitments that
were included in the Final Scope Elements for US 36 Bus Rapid Transit, as approved by the
RTD Board of Directors September 17, 2013.
2. Arterial BRT/Enhanced Bus Service – Proceed into advanced planning, environmental
clearance and preliminary engineering via submittal of TIGER Planning Grant (submitted April
28, 2014) for SH 119 from Longmont to Boulder as the first priority; and US 287 (as selected
by staff, based on cost effectiveness and ridership) as the next priority. One or both corridors
could be implemented following the next phase of study based on further refinement of
regional priorities, project scopes, funding availability and leveraging opportunities.
3. North I-25/Downtown Express Reverse Commute Solutions – In the short-term, RTD should
work with CDOT to advance a bus-on-shoulder concept. For the long-term, advanced
planning for systematic improvements should be initiated for this segment of I-25.
4. Northwest Rail – The stakeholders recognize the present funding challenges and
accompanying near-term inability to secure an agreement with the BNSF. However, as noted
above, completion of Northwest Rail, while a longer term goal, remains a priority. On an
annual basis, RTD will explore and update Northwest Rail implementation strategies and
report to stakeholders and the public.
5. Remaining Arterial BRT/Enhanced Bus Service Corridors – This priority would be a long-term
goal depending on funding availability and further refinement of regional goals, project scopes,
funding availability and leveraging opportunities. These corridors include:
a. SH 7 from Boulder to I-25
b. 120th Avenue from Broomfield to I-25
c. S. Boulder Rd from Boulder to I-25
d. SH 42/95th Street in the Louisville area
e. 28th Street/Broadway Arterial BRT/Enhanced Bus Service improvements.

1.B.1

North Metro Extension from SH 7 to Longmont
Given the high estimated cost, combined with projected low ridership, the stakeholders opted not to
proceed with any action that would advance the North Metro Rail Extension (from SH 7 to
Longmont) at this time. They recommended that the corridor should be re-evaluated in the future if
population densities or other conditions change.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact directly related to this action; however, should the Board at a later date, and
after further study, opt to move forward with specific recommendations from the Consensus, there will
be a financial impact to the District.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning and Development
Committee that the RTD Board of Directors approve the attached resolution, which accepts
the Final Consensus Statement as developed by the Northwest Area Mobility Study
stakeholders for priorities within the Northwest Study Area.
Implementation of these
priorities will be subject to future Board consideration and approval.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not approve the attached resolution, which
accepts the Final Consensus Statement as developed by the Northwest Area Mobility Study
stakeholders. This action is not recommended given the considerable commitment on the part
of RTD and the stakeholders to reach this consensus, which provides RTD a path forward for
implementing mobility improvements in the Northwest area.

RESOLUTION No. ____
SERIES OF 2014
ACCEPTING THE CONSENSUS STATEMENT OF THE NORTHWEST AREA
MOBILITY STUDY STAKEHOLDERS
Whereas, RTD initiated the Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS), in April 2013. The purpose
of the study was to develop consensus among RTD, the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT)
and the Northwest-area stakeholders, including local jurisdictions and businesses, on cost effective and
efficient mobility improvements to serve the Northwest area;
Whereas, the Northwest area stakeholders and RTD executed a Memorandum of Understanding
(MOU) dated January 14, 2013. The MOU included a stakeholder involvement plan for achieving
consensus;
Whereas, RTD and the stakeholders analyzed a wide variety of alternatives to address the study
purpose; and
Whereas, the Northwest area stakeholders formulated a Final Consensus Statement, which was
endorsed on April 18, 2014, to document the principles and priorities which the stakeholders desired for
mobility improvements in the Northwest area; and
Whereas, RTD has submitted a Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery
(TIGER) grant to pursue advanced planning on two of the high-priority Bus Rapid Transit corridors
identified in the Final Consensus Statement.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that:
The RTD Board of Directors accepts the attached Final Consensus Statement as developed by
the Northwest Area Mobility Study stakeholders and presented to the Board Planning & Development
Committee on May 13, 2014; and
RTD will be proactive, aggressive and creative so as to advance the recommendations and
priorities as described in the Final Consensus Statement, with implementation of these priorities subject to
future RTD Board consideration and approval.

Passed and adopted by the Board of Directors of the Regional Transportation District on
the 24th day of June, 2014.
