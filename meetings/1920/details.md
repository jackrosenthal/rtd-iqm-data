#### 1. Approval of NAMS Recommendation

It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the RTD Board of Directors approve the attached Resolution, which accepts the Final Consensus Statement as developed by the Northwest Area Mobility Study stakeholders for priorities within the Northwest Study Area.  Implementation of these priorities will be subject to future Board consideration and approval.

Motion:              Director Hoy made the motion to move this item to the full Board meeting at the June 24, 2014 Board Meeting.

Director Deadwyler seconded the motion.

Discussion:               Chris Quinn, Project Manager for Planning, reminded the Directors about the Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS) presentation during the May 13, 2014 Planning and Development Committee Meeting.  At that time staff presented the findings of the study, which was summarized in the Final Consensus Statement as developed by the NAMS stakeholders.

Director Hoy wanted to confirm that the document staff was referring to was the letter sent from the US 36 Mayors/Commissioners Coalition (MCC) to General Manager Phil Washington on April 9, 2014.  Chris Quinn replied that document became the basis for the consensus statement.  The process was reviewed by two groups:

- A Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) which included staff members from the northwest area local jurisdictions, Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT), Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG), the University of Colorado Boulder, 36 Commuting Solutions and the North Area Transportation Alliance (NATA)

- A Policy Advisory Committee (PAC), consisting of the elected officials from the local jurisdictions as well as representatives from CDOT, the 36 Commuting Solutions Board of Directors, NATA and the RTD Board members representing Districts within the study area.

At the final PAC meeting, stakeholders arrived at a consensus on how to move forward with transit improvements in the northwest area.  A Consensus Statement was developed to document the principles and priorities desired by the stakeholders.

Director Hoy confirmed that the motion calls for future RTD Board consideration and approval indicating ongoing discussion on the subject.

Director Lubow emphasized that her constituents would like to see the Northwest Rail line built.  She also stressed the stakeholders asked for an annual RTD report on the status of the rail.

Director Bagley said he appreciated the opportunity to meet with Director James and 36 Commuting Solutions representatives.  He said he understands and is supportive of the stakeholders Final Consensus Statement. He pointed the Directors to priority #4:

“The stakeholders recognize the present funding challenges and accompanying near-term inability to secure an agreement with the BNSF.  However, as noted above, completion of Northwest Rail, while a longer term goal, remains a priority.  On an annual basis, RTD will explore and update Northwest Rail implementation strategies and report to stakeholders and the public.”

He recalled from the Southwest Corridor experience that construction should not start until there can be construction for revenue service.  He will be voting no at this meeting and will probably introduce an amendment during the Board Meeting.

Director Anderson said she supports the Consensus statement as recognition of community work as well as Board acceptance of the stakeholders’ priorities.

Chair Sisk requested that a copy of the final consensus statement get attached to the Resolution.

Committee Chair declared the motion PASSED.

#### 1. RTP/Senate Bill 208 Update

Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager for Planning, presented the Regional Transportation Plan (RTP)/Senate Bill 208 update as found starting on page 19 of the FasTracks Monitoring/Government Relations/Planning and Development Committee Meetings Packet for June 3, 2014.  He was joined by Susan Wood, Project Manager for Planning, and Genevieve Hutchison, Transportation Planner.

The update explained two (2) concurrent processes: the Baseline Report on FasTracks and the Base System Fixed Guideway.

The Baseline Report on FasTracks update gave a status on the FasTracks projects, an updated schedule of completion, a revised schedule for the Southeast Rail extension, bus service levels and operations.   In order to comply with Senate Bill 208, FasTracks reports have been prepared for DRCOG review and approval since 2004.

The Base System Fixed Guideway update gave a background on the Senate Bill 208 which requires RTD to submit a report on fixed guideway projects (currently 119 BRT and US 287) to the DRCOG for approval.

Both processes need to be submitted to DRCOG by August 1, 2014.  Staff is updating the Board during the June meeting, will present items for review and action during the July FasTracks and Planning and Development committee meetings in order to have Board action on July 15.  DRCOG will review/approve the reviews during the fall.  These reports will be included in the DRCOG 2040 RTP for approval in December, 2014

Bill Van Meter reiterated the revised Southeast Extension schedule, noting the request to enter the engineering phase must be made in September, 2014 to meet FTA’s window for the President’s 2015 budget.  They anticipate an FFGA in early to mid 2016.

Director Lubow asked if staff knew RTD’s funding responsibility for the Southeast Rail extension as expressed in the Full Funding Grant Agreement.  Bill Van Meter answered that staff is waiting for local stakeholders’ final commitments to RTD and will communicate to the Board the final amounts prior to the July action deadline.

Director Anderson asked if staff anticipated any modifications to the Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM) and the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) during the SB208 process, specifically as it pertains to rubber tire/bus services.  Bill Van Meter answered that staff does not anticipate any changes to the RAM/FISA assumptions adopted by the Board in late 2012.

Director Folska pointed out Bill Van Meters’ comments relating service to the inflation rate and asked what would happen if the inflation is negative.  Bill Van Meter answered that in the case of negative inflation, FasTracks will fund the same amount of service hours.  He said that staff understood the Board’s intent for FasTracks to continue funding base system service at the level determined at that time.  If a negative inflation were to occur, the dollar amount would decrease but the service purchased by FasTracks would remain the same.  General Manager Phil Washington pointed out that if such scenario were to happen staff would come to the Board.

General Manager Phil Washington clarified that in order for RTD to accept federal funding, our plans must be included in DRCOG’s plans.  RTD is leveraging the Full Funding Grant Agreement of $92 million and the substantial contributions from local governments for the Southeast Rail extension.  This update lays the groundwork to move the Southeast Rail extension up in the schedule.
