BACKGROUND
On January 19, 2021, the General Manager and CEO, with support of the Board of Directors, submitted
a written request to the American Public Transportation Association (APTA) for a peer review of the
agency’s internal audit function.
APTA accepted RTD’s request and a Peer Review Panel was convened virtually in February and March
2021 to assist in reviewing the agency’s internal audit function. The review was conducted by highly
experienced transit professionals who were selected based on their subject matter expertise. The
Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) International Professional Practice Framework (the “Standards”) and
the IIA Quality Assessment Manual were used to perform the review.
Specifically, the scope of the peer review included:
1. The audit functions performed by the Internal Audit Division (division) as compared with the audit
units of similar agencies;
2. The efficacy of the division in fulfilling the goals stated in its Board-approved charter;
3. The division’s compliance with recognized audit standards and practices;
4. The reporting structure of the division as compared with audit units of other agencies;
5. The adequacy of the division’s report documents, including their format, findings, conclusions
and recommendations;

6. The current knowledge, skills and abilities of the audit division employees, including an
assessment of any technical knowledge needed to perform internal information technology (IT)
audits;
7. The division’s practices regarding follow-up to audit recommendations.
DISCUSSION
The panel conducted interviews with 12 agency representatives including Board members and staff and
conducted research to determine guidelines, comparisons and best practices, and an analysis of financial
records and a review of relevant supporting documentation were performed to understand agency
practices and analyze financial records.
The review yielded 17 recommendations, summarized in Section 5 of the attached Peer Review Report.
The observations and recommendations provided by the panel are offered as an industry resource to
assist RTD as it develops its strategies for the Internal Audit Division.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Future financial impacts are yet to be determined.

Internal Audit Function Provided to the Regional
Transportation District
1. Methodology and scope of review
The APTA Peer Review process is well-established as a valuable resource to the industry for assessing all
aspects of transit operations and functions.
The Regional Transportation District, more commonly referred to as RTD, is the regional agency operating
public transit services in eight out of the 12 counties in the Denver-Aurora-Boulder Combined Statistical Area
in Colorado. It operates over a 2,342-square-mile area, serving 3.08 million people. RTD was organized in
1969 and is governed by a 15-member, publicly elected board of directors. Directors are elected to a four-year
term and represent a specific district of about 180,000 constituents.
The peer review was conducted virtually by highly experienced transit professionals who were selected based
on their subject matter expertise. The Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) International Professional Practice
Framework (the “Standards”) and the IIA Quality Assessment Manual were used to perform the review.
Through the benefits of interviews of agency staff and review of relevant documents, the panel concluded its
review with a summary of observations and recommendations to the RTD board. The APTA Peer Review
team conducted 12 interviews that included the following:

Acting Chief Financial Officer.
Senior Manager, Human Resources.
Senior Manager, Materials Management.
State Audit Manager Rubin Brown.
Audit Manager (external auditors).
RTD Auditor.
Others as necessary to gain an understanding of how RTD operates.

Research was conducted to determine guidelines, comparisons and best practices, and an analysis of financial
records and a review of relevant supporting documentation were performed. The observations and
recommendations provided by the panel are offered as an industry resource to assist the RTD organization as
it develops its strategies.

2. Noteworthy accomplishments within the RTD organization
During the review, the panel noted the following RTD accomplishments: RTD currently operates a bus and
rail system that has a service area of 2,342 square miles. It employed 2,888 people and reported 97.6 million
boardings in 2018. It had a $675.5 million operating budget for the year of 2018. RTD is constructing the

voter-approved FasTracks transit expansion that will add 122 miles of new commuter rail and light rail,
18 miles (29 kilometers) of rapid transit bus service, 21,000 new parking spaces at rail and bus stations, and
enhance bus service across the eight-county district.

3. Conclusions


The RTD Internal Audit Division does not comply with the Institute of Internal Auditors International
Professional Practices Framework (the Standards) as it pertains to:
1. Independence and structure;
2. Risk assessment at the enterprise level;
3. Audit work performed (planning, field work, reporting and documentation of work); and
4. Audit recommendation follow-up.



The RTD Financial Administration & Audit Committee should do the following:
1. Establish an independent, objective assurance and advisory internal audit function designed
to add value and improve RTD’s operations.
2. Ensure that the internal audit function uses the spirit of the COSO framework and the
Institute of Internal Auditor’s International Professional Practices Framework to guide its
work and approach to evaluating and improving the effectiveness of risk management,
control and governance processes.
3. Ensure that the RTD internal audit function’s organizational independence is derived from its
reporting structure, as it should report functionally to the Audit Committee of the RTD Board
of Directors.
4. Ensure that day-to-day supervision of the internal audit function falls under the RTD general
manager and CEO, as the function reports administratively to the general manager and CEO.

While there are many best practices demonstrated in the organization, there are also various enhancement
opportunities based on our observations and comparison of RTD with other high-performing organizations,
which included the following:
1.
2.
3.
4.

Reviewing its Board Governance activities regarding board recommendations and approvals.
Having a more formalized process to track corrective action plans for all audit recommendations.
Performing a formalized risk assessment of the RTD organization.
Implementing an ethics training program and anonymous hotline.

4. Notable observations
4.1 Size of audit function
The audit functions performed by the Internal Audit Division as compared with the audit units of similar
agencies were found to be smaller in size, thus limiting their capabilities. The function has a budgeted
headcount of three positions and should be increased to at least five positions.

4.2 Effectiveness with respect to charter
The Internal Audit Division is not effective in fulfilling the goals stated in its board-approved charter. There is
no direct evidence that the board and its Finance, Administration & Audit Committee periodically approves
the internal audit charter. The RTD has a formal internal audit charter; however, the version provided was
dated December 2017. RTD’s organizational chart dated July 2020 shows a reporting line to the general
manager/CEO but not to the board or its Finance, Administration & Audit Committee.

Based on the peer review work performed, it is the panel’s opinion that:

1.C.1.a
FINDINGS OF THE NATSA PEER REVIEW PANEL

The performance evaluation provided for review did not include evidence of input from the Finance,
Administration & Audit Committee. While the mission of Internal Audit and the mandatory elements of the
International Professional Practices Framework are referenced in the internal audit charter, there is no
evidence that RTD’s internal audit manager/CAE discusses this information with the General Manager and
CEO, the Senior Leadership Team and the board. There is no direct evidence of ongoing communication with
the board or its Finance, Administration & Audit Committee. The internal audit manager/CAE does not have
unrestricted access to the board. This was also confirmed based on information gathered through interviews
with the internal audit manager/CAE and members of the board.
According to the Roles and Responsibilities of the Finance, Administration & Audit Committee as outlined in
its charter, the chair of the committee is expected to meet with the internal audit manager on an as-needed
basis to discuss any matters of relevant concern or importance, particularly when the auditor reasonably
believes that a matter would impact the health, safety and welfare of RTD, its customers or its employees, or
would otherwise constitute an emergency in the mind of a reasonable person. This is not the case in practice.
According to the Roles and Responsibilities of the Finance, Administration & Audit Committee Charter, the
vice chair is expected to meet with the chair and the internal audit manager on an as-needed basis to discuss
any matters of relevant concern or importance. This is not the case in practice.
According to the Roles and Responsibilities of the Finance, Administration & Audit Committee Charter, the
committee as a whole is expected to monitor audit activities, evaluate audit reports and track close-out of
audit findings. This is not the case in practice. The staffing expectations outlined in the Finance,
Administration & Audit Committee Charter require that the CFO, audit managers and administration staff
participate in meetings and be available to address questions or concerns raised by board members on a
particular item along with other outside resources that the committee requests and submit any reports
specified by the board.
According to the Finance, Administration & Audit Committee Charter, the internal audit manager is expected
to schedule an annual meeting with the full board through the Finance, Administration & Audit Committee to
present and discuss the draft proposed Audit Plan for the following year. The internal audit manager is also
expected to schedule two or more meetings, based on the circumstances and perceived need, with the Finance,
Administration & Audit Committee to provide updates regarding pending audits as may be reasonably
appropriate, which meetings may require convening an executive session due to the privileged or confidential
or other protected nature of such discussions. This does not appear to be the case in practice.

4.3 Language to establish an Internal Audit Department
The RTD bylaws do not include language to establish and maintain an Internal Audit Department. Please
consider the following language to include in the bylaws and reference in the Internal Audit Department
Charter:
In addition, The Board shall maintain an Internal Audit Department, led by the Manager of
Internal and IT Audit, who shall report functionally to the Board of Directors and
administratively to the General Manager/CEO. The Board of Directors shall approve the riskbased Internal Audit Plan. The Manager of Internal and IT Audit shall respond to requests for
assistance from the General Manager/CEO, so long as those requests are not inconsistent with
the Manager of Internal and IT Audit’s responsibilities to the Board. All personnel decisions

The Authority section of the Internal Audit Charter dated December 2017 shows the expected functional
reporting relationship to the board and administrative reporting relationship to the GM/CEO. However, in
practice the chief audit executive (CAE) has no reporting relationship to the board. According to the Finance,
Administration & Audit Committee Charter, the internal audit manager should have a dotted-line reporting
structure to the board, and the committee is expected to provide input for the manager’s annual evaluation.

1.C.1.a
FINDINGS OF THE NATSA PEER REVIEW PANEL

regarding the Manager of Internal and IT Audit, including but not limited to hiring, firing,
promoting, demoting and setting salaries, shall be made by the Board. The Board shall
conduct the performance evaluation of the Manager of Internal and IT Audit in consultation
with the General Manager/CEO.

The Internal Audit Division does not comply with recognized audit standards and practices (the Standards) as
it pertains to independence and structure; risk assessment at the enterprise level, audit work performed
(planning, field work, reporting and documentation of work), and audit recommendation follow-up.

4.5 Documentation of audit plans
There is no way to determine the proper allocation of resources against audits identified in the annual audit
plan as a result of a lack of a comprehensive risk assessment. Audits are mainly identified through interviews
with management, which is only one of many sources for the audit plan. In addition, the thoroughness of
work performed cannot be fully evaluated, as time budgets and the recognition of actual time spent on
assignments are not documented or monitored. Audit work papers should be automated to prevent loss and
assist in the preparation of well-organized and properly documented audit plans and work. Judgmental
sampling is the main sampling technique used or no sampling approach plan is evident.
We noted that all auditable units in said departments were not identified or documented, risk ratings are not
performed, nor has criteria been established to identify or evaluate potential auditable areas. The audit
universe presented to the board is a “running list” of items that is an incomplete list. We noted no evidence to
demonstrate the additions or deletions. We noted that key areas were not in the audit universe and that areas
such as maintenance were too high of a category to perform a proper assessment. For example, bus
maintenance could be several sub-audits, such as scheduled maintenance, emergency repairs, midlife repairs
and long-term overhaul. In addition, Internal Audit did not develop an internal audit plan that usually includes
a list of proposed audit engagements (and specification regarding whether the engagements are assurance or
consulting in nature) and rationale for selecting each proposed engagement (e.g., risk rating, time since last
audit, change in management).

4.6 Audit plan contents
The Standards state the following:
The proposed internal audit plan may include a list of proposed audit engagements (and
specification regarding whether the engagements are assurance or consulting in nature);
rationale for selecting each proposed engagement (risk rating, time since last audit, change in
management, etc.) objectives and scope of each proposed engagement; and a list of initiatives
or projects that result from the internal audit strategy but may not be directly related to an
audit engagement.
We noted no evidence to support this.

4.7 Resource limitations
Resource limitations affect the priorities in the internal audit plan. If resources are not sufficient to complete
every proposed engagement in the plan, then some engagements may be deferred, and some risks may go
unaddressed. During the board presentation, the CAE discusses the proposed internal audit plan and the risk
assessment on which it is based, indicating the risks that will be addressed, as well as any risks that cannot be
addressed due to resource constraints. Board members can discuss this information and make
recommendations before ultimately approving the internal audit plan. We noted no evidence to support this.

4.4 Compliance with recognized audit standards

1.C.1.a
FINDINGS OF THE NATSA PEER REVIEW PANEL

We did note, in reviewing the board minutes, that the board questioned whether headcount resources were
sufficient but noted no response or follow-up to the question.

The chief audit executive (CAE) must report periodically to senior leadership and the board on the internal
audit activity’s purpose, authority, responsibility and performance relative to its plan and on its conformance
with the Code of Ethics and the Standards. Reporting must also include significant risk and control issues,
including fraud risks, governance issues and other matters that require the attention of senior leadership
and/or the board. We noted no evidence to support this.

4.9 CAE responsibilities
The CAE should establish or review the following:





The internal audit charter, including the internal audit activity’s purpose, authority and responsibility;
The internal audit plan and key performance indicators to measure the internal audit activity’s
progress toward accomplishing the plan;
The quality assurance and improvement program, which gauges the internal audit activity’s
conformance with the Mandatory Guidance of the International Professional Practices Framework
(IPPF);
Processes for identifying significant risk and control issues.

We noted no evidence to support this.

4.10 Reporting structure
The reporting structure of the division as compared with audit units of other agencies is generally not
consistent as it reports functionally to the RTD general manager/CEO and administratively to the board.
Proper governance requires that the internal audit function report functionally to the Internal Audit Committee
and administratively to the General Manager/CEO.

4.11 Document standards
The Internal Audit Division’s workpaper and report documents, including their format, findings, conclusions,
and recommendations, are not adequate to ensure compliance with the Standards.

4.12 Resource allocation
The Standards state the following:
The CAE usually itemizes the audits that comprise the internal audit plan and then assesses
the types and quantity of resources that would be needed to accomplish each audit project.
Estimates are generally based on past experience with a particular project or comparisons to a
similar project. The CAE can compare the resources needed to accomplish the plan’s
priorities with those available to the internal audit activity to determine whether any gaps
exist. This comparison can be used as a basis for determining the impact of resource
limitations.
We noted no evidence to support this.

4.13 Audit report contents












Audit reports did not have an overall conclusion.
Conclusions do not match audit objectives.
Reports issued do not have five elements of audit findings (criteria, conclusion, impact, management
response and recommendation).
There were no corrective action dates in management response.
Management partially disagrees or disagrees with no audit comment or evidence of resolution.
Financial information was not provided in reports.
Draft and final report objectives were changed with no reason documented.
One audit dropped all findings in the draft final report.
There were no dates on audit reports.
Immaterial items were included in reports.
Audit recommendations were not always actionable.

4.14 Adherence to IIA Standards
While the CAE is aware of the IIA Standards, the application and adherence of such Standards needs
improvement.

4.15 Quality assurance and improvement program
The Standards state the following:
The CAE is also responsible for implementing a quality assurance and improvement program,
as required by Standard 1300, and for implementing the methods and tools related to the 1200
series of standards. The CAE must also evaluate the internal audit activity’s effectiveness to
achieve conformance with Standard 2000. Typically, the CAE develops metrics for
evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of the internal audit activity. Tools the CAE may
use for this purpose include soliciting feedback through post-audit client surveys, completing
annual performance reviews of individual internal auditors, implementing the quality
assurance and improvement program, and comparing the organization’s internal audit activity
against contemporary internal audit groups in the industry (benchmarking).
We noted no evidence to support this.

4.16 Follow-up to audit recommendations
The division’s practices regarding follow-up to audit recommendations are not adequate. There are no
implementation dates to track completion or monitor progress. There are inadequate explanations to close out
unimplemented recommendations or evidence to support the closure of implemented recommendations. There
is no evidence to demonstrate recommendation implementation status was presented to the Audit Committee.

5. Summary of recommendations
The APTA Peer Review Panel recommends the following:
1. We recommend a clearer delineation between the RTD Finance Committee and Administrative &
Audit Committee. We recommend the Audit Committee be a separate stand-alone committee.
2. We recommend that the Audit Committee establish for the Internal Audit Office a functional
reporting relationship to the board and administrative reporting relationship to the general manager
and CEO.

3. We recommend that the Audit Committee update and approve the Audit Committee Charter.
4. We recommend that an internal audit strategy and approach be developed that aligns with the goals
and expectations of the organization’s leadership.
5. We recommend that an Audit Committee work plan designed to add value and improve RTD’s
operations be developed.
6. We recommend that the internal audit office staffing complement be increased by at least two staff
(one manager, one senior auditor). Consider co-sourcing opportunities to supplement resources.
7. We recommend that the internal audit function perform an independent risk assessment of RTD. Risk
ratings (materiality, reputational, internal controls, etc.) should be developed, scored and welldocumented.
8. We recommend that the internal audit function establish a risk-based plan to determine the priorities
of the internal audit activity, consistent with the organization’s goals. Include budgeted hours with
anticipated completion dates.
9. We recommend that the internal audit function develop an allocation of resources plan to identify
achievable assignments identified in the audit universe.
10. We recommend that the internal audit function document the audit universe identification process.
11. We recommend that the internal audit function adhere to the Standards for risk assessment at the
enterprise level, audit work performed (planning, field work, reporting and documentation of work)
and audit recommendation follow-up.
12. We recommend that the internal audit function perform a risk assessment at the auditable level for
each audit endeavor.
13. We recommend that the internal audit function establish through automation a more robust audit
recommendation follow-up process.
14. We recommend that the internal audit function automate through audit software the workpaper
process to assist in the preparation of well-organized, properly documented audit plans and work.
15. We recommend that the internal audit function develop an audit sampling policy.
16. We recommend that the internal audit function establish a quality assurance and improvement
program that gauges the internal audit activity’s conformance with the Mandatory Guidance of the
International Professional Practices Framework.
17. We recommend that the board revise the RTD Bylaws to include language to establish and maintain
an Internal Audit Division.

Peer Review Scope and Methodology
•

The APTA Peer Review Panel was convened at the request of RTD to
assist the organization by conducting a peer review to satisfy the
requirements specified in the RTD peer review request.

•

The APTA peer review process engages highly experienced and
respected audit professionals of the public transit industry who
provide their time and support to conduct required reviews.

•

12 interviews were conducted with the RTD board; board chair;
chair of Finance, Administration & Audit Committee; general
manager; executive management team; and chief audit executive.

•

The Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) International Professional
Practice Framework (the “Standards”) and the IIA Quality
Assessment Manual were used to determine compliance.

•

APTA’s peer review members reviewed best practices.

•

There is no direct evidence that the board and its Finance, Administration & Audit Committee Charter
periodically approves the internal audit charter. The RTD has a formal internal audit charter; however, the
version provided was dated December 2017.

•

RTD’s organizational chart dated July 2020 shows a reporting line to the general manager/CEO but not to the
board or its Finance, Administration & Audit Committee. The Authority section of the Internal Audit Charter
dated December 2017 shows the expected functional reporting relationship to the board and administrative
reporting relationship to the GM/CEO. However, in practice the chief audit executive (CAE) has no reporting
relationship to the board.

•

According to the Finance, Administration & Audit Committee Charter, the internal audit manager should have a
dotted-line reporting structure to the board, and the committee is expected to provide input for the manager’s
annual evaluation. The performance evaluation provided for review did not include evidence of input from the
Finance, Administration & Audit Committee.

While the mission of Internal Audit and the mandatory elements of the International Professional Practices
Framework are referenced in the internal audit charter, there is no evidence that RTD’s internal audit
manager/CAE discusses this information with senior management and the board.

•

There is no direct evidence of ongoing communication with the board or its Finance, Administration & Audit
Committee. The internal audit manager/CAE does not have unrestricted access to the board. This was also
confirmed based on information gathered through interviews with the internal audit manager/CAE and
members of the board.

•

According to the Roles and Responsibilities of the Finance, Administration & Audit Committee as outlined in its
charter, the chair of the committee is expected to meet with the internal audit manager on an as-needed basis
to discuss any matters of relevant concern or importance, particularly when the auditor reasonably believes
that a matter would impact the health, safety and welfare of RTD, its riders or its employees, or would
otherwise constitute an emergency in the mind of a reasonable person. This is not the case in practice.

committee requests—and submit any reports specified by the board.

•

According to the Finance, Administration & Audit Committee Charter, the internal audit manager is expected to
schedule an annual meeting with the full board through the Finance, Administration & Audit Committee to
present and discuss the draft proposed Audit Plan for the following year. The internal audit manager is also
expected to schedule two or more meetings, based on the circumstances and perceived need, with the
Finance, Administration & Audit Committee to provide updates regarding pending audits as may be reasonably
appropriate, which meetings may require convening an executive session due to the privileged or confidential

priorities of the internal audit activity, consistent with the organization’s goals. Interpretation: To
develop the risk-based plan, the chief audit executive consults with senior management and the
board and obtains an understanding of the organization’s strategies, key business objectives,
associated risks and risk management processes. The chief audit executive must review and adjust
the plan as necessary, in response to changes in the organization’s business, risks, operations,

•

The CAE stated that the audit universe is never complete as we add to it or delete items. We noted no evidence
to demonstrate the additions or deletions. We noted that key areas were not in the audit universe and that
areas such as maintenance were too high of a category to perform a proper assessment. For example, bus
maintenance could be several sub-audits, such as scheduled maintenance, emergency repairs, midlife repairs
and long-term overhaul.

•

Standard 2010 states: The CAE develops an internal audit strategy and approach that aligns with the goals and
expectations of the organization’s leadership. In addition, as stated in Standard 2010, the CAE creates a riskbased internal audit plan to determine the priorities of the internal audit activity’s assurance and consulting
engagements. This process considers the input of senior management and the board, as well as a documented
annual risk assessment (Standard 2010.A1). RTD Internal Audit does perform this action, but it was not
documented in order to assess the conversation.

•

The Standards state: The CAE develops an internal audit plan that usually includes a list of proposed audit
engagements (and specification regarding whether the engagements are assurance or consulting in nature);
rationale for selecting each proposed engagement (e.g., risk rating, time since last audit, change in
management). We noted no evidence to support this.

The CAE is responsible for communicating the plan, resource requirements and the impact of
resource limitations.
•

The Standards require that: In the internal audit plan, the CAE typically defines the internal audit activity’s
scope and deliverables, specifies the resources needed to achieve the plan, and outlines an approach to
develop the internal audit activity and measure its performance and progress against the plan. According to
Standard 2020, the CAE is responsible for communicating the plan, resource requirements, and the impact of
resource limitations to the board and senior management and receiving their approval. Significant interim
changes to the plan must also be communicated and approved. We noted no evidence to support this.

•

The Standards further add that: To ensure that the audit universe covers all of the organization’s key risks (to
the extent possible), the internal audit activity typically independently reviews and corroborates the key risks
that were identified by senior management. According to Standard 2010.A1, the internal audit plan must be
based on a documented risk assessment, undertaken at least annually, that considers the input of senior
management and the board. We noted no evidence to support this.

Standard 2020: Communication and Approval (cont.)
The Standards require that: The chief audit executive must communicate the internal audit activity’s plans and
resource requirements, including significant interim changes, to senior management and the board for review and
approval. The chief audit executive must also communicate the impact of resource limitations.
Before communicating to senior management and the board regarding the internal audit plan, the internal audit
activity’s resource requirements, and the impact of resource limitations, the chief audit executive determines the
resources needed to implement the plan, based on the risk-based priorities identified during the planning process
(Standard 2010). Resources may include people (e.g., labor hours and skills), technology (e.g., audit tools and
techniques), timing/schedule (availability of resources), and funding. A portion of resources is usually reserved to
address changes to the audit plan that may arise, such as unanticipated risks that could affect the organization
and requests for consulting engagements from senior management and/or the board. We noted no evidence to
support this.

Standard 2030: Resource Management
•

The Standards require that: The chief audit executive must ensure that internal audit resources are appropriate,
sufficient, and effectively deployed to achieve the approved plan. Interpretation: “Appropriate” refers to the mix of
knowledge, skills and other competencies needed to perform the plan. “Sufficient” refers to the quantity of
resources needed to accomplish the plan. Resources are effectively deployed when they are used in a way that
optimizes the achievement of the approved plan. We noted no evidence to support this.

•

The Standards state: When developing the internal audit plan (Standard 2010) and reviewing it with the board and
senior management (Standard 2020), the chief audit executive (CAE) considers and discusses the resources needed
to accomplish the plan’s priorities. To implement Standard 2030, the CAE usually begins by gaining a deeper
understanding of the resources available to the internal audit activity in the board-approved internal audit plan. The
CAE may carefully consider the number of internal audit staff and productive work hours available to implement the
plan within the organization’s schedule constraints. Productive work hours generally exclude factors such as paid
time off and time spent on training and administrative tasks. We noted no evidence to support this.

Resource Management; Standard 2030 – Understanding of the resources; Standard 2060 – Internal audit activity’s
performance
•

The Standards state: Because the CAE must report on the impact of resource limitations (Standard 2020)
and on the internal audit activity’s performance relative to its plan (Standard 2060), it is important for the
CAE to gauge the overall adequacy of resources continuously. To affirm that resources are appropriate,
sufficient and effectively deployed, the CAE establishes metrics that assess the internal audit activity’s
performance and solicits feedback from internal audit clients. We noted no evidence to support this.

Attachment: RTD Virtual Peer Review Final Presentation -

Standard 2030: Resource Management (cont.)

Packet Pg. 4730

1.C.1.b

•

The Standards cite that: The proposed internal audit plan may include a list of proposed audit engagements (and
specification regarding whether the engagements are assurance or consulting in nature); rationale for selecting
each proposed engagement (risk rating, time since last audit, change in management, etc.) objectives and scope
of each proposed engagement; and a list of initiatives or projects that result from the internal audit strategy but
may not be directly related to an audit engagement. We noted no evidence to support this.

•

Resource limitations affect the priorities in the internal audit plan. For example, if resources are not sufficient to
complete every proposed engagement in the plan, then some engagements may be deferred, and some risks
may go unaddressed. During the board presentation, the CAE discusses the proposed internal audit plan and the
risk assessment on which it is based, indicating the risks that will be addressed, as well as any risks that cannot
be addressed due to resource constraints. Board members can discuss this information and make
recommendations before ultimately approving the internal audit plan. We noted no evidence to support this. We
did note, in reviewing the board minutes, that the board questioned whether headcount resources were sufficient
but noted no response or follow-up to the question.

Standard 2060: Reporting to Senior Management and the Board
•

The chief audit executive must report periodically to senior management and the board on the internal audit
activity’s purpose, authority, responsibility and performance relative to its plan and on its conformance with the
Code of Ethics and the Standards. Reporting must also include significant risk and control issues, including fraud
risks, governance issues and other matters that require the attention of senior management and/or the board.
We noted no evidence to support this.

•

The frequency and content of reporting are determined collaboratively by the chief audit executive, senior
management and the board. The frequency and content of reporting depends on the importance of the
information to be communicated and the urgency of the related actions to be taken by senior management
and/or the board. The chief audit executive’s reporting and communication to senior management and the
board must include information about the audit charter; independence of the internal audit activity; the audit
plan and progress against the plan; resource requirements; results of audit activities; conformance with the Code
of Ethics and Standards, and action plans to address any significant conformance issues; management’s response
to risk that, in the CAE’s judgment, may be unacceptable to the organization. These and other CAE
communication requirements are referenced throughout the Standards. We noted no evidence to support this.

Additionally, the CAE may find it helpful to establish or review the following: the internal audit charter,

4. The Audit Committee and general manager asked to evaluate…

The reporting structure of the division as compared with audit units of other
agencies.
Conclusion: The reporting structure of the division as compared with audit units of other
agencies is generally not consistent, as it reports functionally to the RTD general
manager/CEO and administratively to the board. Proper governance requires that the
internal audit function report functionally to the Internal Audit Committee and
administratively to the general manager/CEO.

•

The chief audit executive must report to a level within the organization that allows the internal audit activity to
fulfill its responsibilities. The CAE must confirm to the board, at least annually, the organizational
independence of the internal audit activity.

•

Interpretation: Organizational independence is effectively achieved when the CAE reports functionally to the
board. Examples of functional reporting to the board involve the board approving the internal audit charter;
approving the risk-based internal audit plan; approving the internal audit budget and resource plan; receiving
communications from the chief audit executive on the internal audit activity’s performance relative to its plan
and other matters; approving decisions regarding the appointment and removal of the chief audit executive;
approving the remuneration of the chief audit executive; and making appropriate inquiries of management and
the chief audit executive to determine whether there are inappropriate scope or resource limitations. This
standard needs to be present in the RTD Charter.

Additionally, The CAE works with the board and senior management to avoid conditions that would affect
internal audit’s ability to perform its responsibilities in an unbiased manner. Often, the CAE has a direct
functional reporting line to the board and an administrative reporting line to a member of senior management.
The reporting line to the board provides the CAE with direct board access for sensitive matters and enables
sufficient organizational status. Administrative reporting to a member of senior management also provides the
CAE with sufficient organizational status, as well as authority to perform duties without impediment and to
address difficult issues with other senior leaders. This standard needs to be present in the RTD Charter.

•

Organizational Independence is effectively
achieved when the CAE reports functionally to
the board. Generally, the CAE also has an
administrative reporting line to senior
management, which further enables the
requisite stature and authority of internal audit
to fulfill its responsibilities.

•

To enhance stature and credibility, the IIA
recommends that the CAE report
administratively to the chief executive officer so
the CAE is clearly in a senior position with the
authority to perform the duties unimpeded.

The Standards state: The CAE usually itemizes the audits that comprise the internal audit plan and then
assesses the types and quantity of resources that would be needed to accomplish each audit project. Estimates
are generally based on past experience with a particular project or comparisons to a similar project. The CAE
can compare the resources needed to accomplish the plan’s priorities with those available to the internal audit
activity to determine whether any gaps exist. This comparison can be used as a basis for determining the
impact of resource limitations. We noted no evidence to support this.

The Standards state: The CAE is also responsible for implementing a quality assurance and improvement
program, as required by Standard 1300, and for implementing the methods and tools related to the 1200 series
of standards. The CAE must also evaluate the internal audit activity’s effectiveness to achieve conformance
with Standard 2000. Typically, the CAE develops metrics for evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of the
internal audit activity. Tools the CAE may use for this purpose include soliciting feedback through post-audit
client surveys, completing annual performance reviews of individual internal auditors, implementing the
quality assurance and improvement program, and comparing the organization’s internal audit activity against
contemporary internal audit groups in the industry (benchmarking). We noted no evidence to support this.

approve the internal audit charter as needed. Evidence that the CAE periodically reviews the internal audit charter
with senior management and the board also exists in minutes from those meetings.

The Standards state: The chief audit executive must establish and maintain a system to
monitor the disposition of results communicated to management.
•

Whether sophisticated or simple, it is important for the CAE to develop a process that captures the relevant
observations, agreed corrective action and current status. For outstanding observations, the information
tracked and captured typically includes the observations communicated to management and their relative risk
rating; the nature of the agreed corrective actions; the timing/deadlines/age of the corrective actions and
changes in target dates; the management/process owner responsible for each corrective action; the current
status of corrective actions, and whether internal audit has confirmed the status. Often, the CAE will develop
or purchase a tool, mechanism or system to track, monitor and report on such information. Based on
information provided to internal audit by the responsible management, the status of the corrective actions is
updated in the system periodically and often directly by management using a shared exception tracking
system. We noted no evidence to support this.
