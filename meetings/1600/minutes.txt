Financial Administration about this item.




Total monthly boardings were 3.1% higher in November 2006 than in November
2005.
Due to the opening of the Southeast Corridor; LRT boardings for November 2006
are estimated to 32.9% higher than November 2005
Total year-to-date boardings were 1.2% higher than year-to-date 2005.

Base Sales and Use Tax
The November actual sales and use tax receipts do not fully reflect sales and use taxes
collected in November. Tax returns for November were not completely processed in the
usual timely manner primarily due to delivery delays and Department of Revenue closures
resulting from the weather during December. November tax returns that were not
processed prior to the Colorado Department of Revenue’s remittance of the November
sales tax will be remitted to the District in the December sales tax remittance.

Farebox Revenues system-wide were 22.8% higher in November 2006 that they
were in November 2005. The increase in farebox revenues can be primarily
attributed to the increase in ridership and the implementation of a fare increase for
