BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
2023 Code of Conduct and Service Suspension Policy
Revisions

February 15, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
February 28, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt revisions to the Code of Conduct and Service Suspension Policy.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Debra A. Johnson, General Manager and CEO
Dr. Joel Fitzgerald, Chief of Police and Emergency Management
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
The RTD Act, Article 9 of Title 32, Colorado Revised Statutes, authorizes the district to develop,
maintain, and operate a mass transportation system for the benefit of the inhabitants of the district.
In order to provide for the safety, convenience, and comfort of all customers, the agency has established
a Code of Conduct (Code) setting forth rules prohibiting certain conduct that may adversely affect use,
operation, or occupancy of RTD vehicles, facilities, or property. To enforce this Code, RTD has
established a Service Suspension Policy (Policy) setting forth procedures and enforcement guidelines.
The Code and Policy are tools in an overarching strategy to maintain a welcoming transit environment
for all RTD employees and customers.
In addition to security personnel and a growing contingent of sworn transit police officers, RTD deploys
a team of mental health clinicians and a full-time outreach coordinator focused on houselessness issues,
in the spirit of firm compassion, to engage with individuals utilizing the system who may be in need of
assistance and those experiencing mental health or substance abuse issues. For several years, the
agency has also engaged with local law enforcement jurisdictions to share resources and information and
bolster the agency’s public safety presence throughout the service area.
Beginning in January 2022, the GM/CEO along with several senior staff members engaged with
representatives from the City and County of Denver, including individuals from Mayor Hancock’s
administration as well as law enforcement, criminal justice, public health, and social services entities, to
form a steering committee focused on mitigating the impacts of unwanted behaviors affecting Denver
Union Station and its surrounding area, as well as other locations in Denver’s central core. The steering
committee and its subcommittees met on a monthly basis with the intent to establish a holistic and
compassionate strategy for the reduction of sales and use of illicit drugs as well as aggressive behaviors

by those not utilizing transit services, patronizing businesses, working, or living in the impacted area.
Staff and contractors are also working towards implementation of additional Crime Prevention through
Environmental Design (CPTED) elements identified through a collaboration with the Denver Police
Department to curb unwelcome behaviors and ensure that multimodal transit hubs are being used by
customers for their intended purpose.
RTD-PD also works closely with WellPower Denver to utilize its Support Team Assisted Response
(STAR) Van, which provides person-centric mobile crisis response to community members experiencing
problems related to mental health, depression, unhouselessness and substance abuse. RTD-PD also
provides support to the Downtown Action Team, which includes members from the Denver Police
Department, Denver Fire Department, Denver Public Works, and outreach organizations that focus on
assisting individuals in the immediate downtown Denver area. RTD-PD have been invited to use the
newly opened AID Center, which stands for “Assessment, Intake, Diversion” and is a drop-off area for
individuals that have committed low level offenses related to theft or shoplifting. The program is
intended to assist these individuals in receiving assistance rather than being subjected to the criminal
system.
During Q4 2022, staff collaborated to craft revisions to the Code and Policy intended to align with both
the Board’s direction regarding the restoration of a welcoming transit environment, pursuant to
Resolution No. 3, Series of 2022, and the recommendations contained in the subsequently published
report from the peer review panel of American Public Transportation Association (APTA) subject matter
experts who convened to assess the agency’s policing model.
The report specifically identified gaps that exposed customers to noncustomers loitering in facilities or
engaging in aberrant or illegal behavior that may jeopardize overall public safety. The recommended
revisions to the Code were made to augment the tools that members of the police department may
employ to address chronic offenders and provides additional opportunities for improvement using
discretion; they strengthen policy but notably remain in alignment with the overall goal of contributing to
the RTD strategic priorities of Community Value, Customer Excellence, and Employee Ownership.
In drafting these revisions, staff garnered input and perspectives from the RTD Police Department,
Operations staff, and the Operator Assault Committee (Committee), comprised of representatives from
the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1001 and the Operations and Administration departments, to
ensure the concerns and experiences of employees and customers were considered. Other employees
were invited to engage with the Committee including Legal Services, Communications and Engagement,
Capital Programs staff, as well as those from the Bus and Rail divisions.
The proposed revisions are intended to provide enforcement tools that are responsive to the present
experiences of RTD’s employees and customers, and do not reduce the expectation that public safety
employees apply alternative problem-solving strategies when engaging community members who suffer
mental health crises, addiction to illegal narcotics, and who are unhoused.
DISCUSSION
This recommended action seeks Board approval to modify the Code and Policy in order to:

1.D.1

•
•

•
•
•
•

•
•
•
•

Clearly differentiate between Code violations and violations related to criminal offenses
Ensure that the most serious consequences in the Policy are for violent criminal offenses,
including increased penalties for criminal offenses committed against RTD’s employees and
contractors
Ensure that recognized fundamental rights are protected for individuals on RTD property
Ensure that RTD, as mandated by state law, is operating a mass transportation system for the
benefit of district inhabitants
Ensure secure and available boarding and seating areas for all customers, including low-income
customers that depend on RTD
Prohibit harassment, sexual harassment, and bullying based on sex, race, color, national origin,
religion, marital status, sexual orientation, transgender status, pregnancy, ancestry, age, military
status, disability, genetic information, or any other status protected by law
Permit consideration of any and all evidence that either supports or negates a finding that an
individual engaged in conduct justifying a suspension
Permit enforcement personnel to consider the totality of the circumstances when issuing
suspensions, including the nature and severity of a criminal offense
Prohibit unprotected speech, such as fighting words or threatening language, that would cause
customers, employees, or contractors to fear for their safety
Prohibit unauthorized use of an electrical or data outlet

In adopting this recommended action:
• The agency seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan priorities of Community Value,
Customer Excellence, and Employee Ownership
• The Board further authorizes staff to incorporate, periodically and as necessary, revisions to the
Code and Policy, based on industry best practices and in alignment with the Board-adopted
Strategic Priorities. Staff will ensure that the Board will be made aware of any such changes prior
to implementation.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no substantive financial impact associated with the adoption of this recommended action.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
RTD Police Department Update

February 14, 2023

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Dr. Joel Fitzgerald, Chief of Police and Emergency Management

PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes

BACKGROUND
On January 19, 2021, the General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) submitted a written request to the
American Public Transportation Association (APTA) for a peer review of the existing RTD Security
Model. APTA accepted the request and convened a peer review panel in March and April 2021, to assist
in a comprehensive review of the agency’s security/transit police model. The review was conducted by
highly experienced and tenured transit professionals who share subject matter expertise in the law
enforcement field. Specifically, the scope of the peer review, and the current status of the
recommendations resulting from the panel’s review, are as follows:
1. Evaluating concerns regarding public safety response models that include contracted security that
often serve as "First Responders” (Initiated)
2. Use of Community Policing Programs, Recruiting/Training Diverse Officers, Use of Community
Service Officers (Ambassadors), Cadet Programs, Community Engagement, and Social-Media to
improve external communications and increase awareness (Initiated)
3. Use of "Paid Fare Zones" in intermodal transit facilities (i.e., Denver Union Station) (Initiated)
4. Use of Armed Security as Second Crew Members/Fare Inspectors on commuter rail and potential
conversion to Train Conductors (Initiated)
5. Collection and use of system data (e.g., incidents, assaults, fare evasion, demographics) –
methodologies and systems (Initiated)
6. Collaborating with City and County of Denver officials to resolve the jurisdictional issues that
inhibit RTD transit police officers from initiating direct law enforcement actions within the City
and County of Denver (Initiated)
On August 22, 2022, following a national recruitment effort, the GM/CEO appointed a new Chief of
Police and Emergency Management and tasked him with leading the implementation of the panel’s
recommendations and to establish the RTD Police Department’s (RTD-PD) operational strategy and
functional direction over the next several years.
DISCUSSION

Packet Pg. 26

1.E.1

The actionable steps identified in the final peer review report yielded a framework for the development
of a community policing strategy, the elements of which are described herein.
The community policing strategy summarizes how RTD-PD has integrated the peer review
recommendations and continues to augment the RTD brand while improving RTD-PD’s legitimacy as a
law enforcement entity. As RTD-PD concurrently assumes a more visible and active role in improving
overall public safety throughout the transit network, the phased hiring of sworn staff and a renewed
commitment to decreasing crime while remaining sensitive to the non-criminal social issues that may
negatively affect employee and customer experiences appropriately frames future departmental
expectations.
RTD-PD’s overarching strategy is to evolve operations to better engage with the community in a trusted
partnership, dedicated to crime prevention, focused on intentional and phased internal growth, and
committed to applying evidence-based solutions to solve complex problems and to promote
infrastructure improvements that enhance the safety of employees and customers.
Efficacy
Recent accomplishments in crime reduction in 2021 and 2022, as compared to 2020, are highly positive
indicators of the efficacy of the approach espoused by the peer review panel and substantiated by RTDPD command staff, specifically with respect to Denver Union Station (DUS) and other facilities. Overall
incidence of crime in the DUS area has declined approximately 34% since September 2022, and almost
37% in comparison to the same three-month period from 2021, which are indicative of the extreme
importance cultural changes can have in any organization. Moreover, a 68% overall systemwide
decrease, between 2020 and 2022, in criminal incidents demonstrates how a strategic and intentional
reinvestment into personnel, facilities, and technology can yield benefits to the agency and its
employees and customers.
Although the incidence of crime trended downward, workload calculations that account for the diverse
needs of RTD stakeholders and community policing deficiencies support the peer review panel’s
recommendations to reduce the historical overreliance on armed and unarmed security as well as the
shift toward a sworn police force that can meet future needs. For example, since August 2022, the
RTD-PD has become more racially diverse and has embraced all tenets of diversity, equity, inclusion and
belonging (DEIB), committing to the “30 by 30 Pledge,” a national initiative to recruit and retain more
women in policing.
Community Policing and Engagement
As RTD-PD continues to transition to a majority sworn police workforce, it is better positioned to nurture
community relationships to collectively mitigate conditions conducive to crime and to expand the
capacity to serve those with mental health, addiction, and housing struggles, without over-criminalizing
non-chronic offenders. In short, RTD’s commitment to hiring and reinvestment in public safety resources
demonstrates that the agency remains cognizant of the importance of public safety when delivered in a
firm, fair, and professional manner, and that has the deployment capacity to meet the diverse needs of
employees and customers.

Packet Pg. 27

1.E.1

The plan of action delineates how increased engagement and partnerships with agencies across the
service area facilitate a coordinated multi-agency approach to improving law enforcement outcomes and
transit system safety.
As RTD-PD becomes a more active participant in proactively addressing regional criminal and social
challenges, the community policing strategy details how RTD-PD intends to improve relations with other
government entities, addiction and mental health treatment providers, and the community.
Capital Improvements
Along with the reinvestment in sworn workforce cited in the peer review recommendations, the
community policing strategy also highlights the need to proactively pursue Capital Improvement Planning
(CIP) funds to design, locate and construct a dedicated facility for the department’s police, emergency
management, and dispatch functions as well as technological CIP needs, such as Records Management
Systems (RMS) and Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) that facilitate evidence-based policing approaches
and that support the ability to use data and evidence to drive internal deployment and decision-making.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with this discussion item. The expansion of sworn RTD-PD
personnel and capital and operating expenses related to this expansion are contemplated in the 2023
Budget.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
May 2023 Service Change Proposals

February 15, 2023

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Ford, Chief Operations Officer
Jessie Carter, Senior Manager, Service Development
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 minutes
BACKGROUND
Commensurate with the service change and voting process detailed in the Collective Bargaining
Agreement (CBA) shared between RTD and the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1001, the May 2023
Service Change Proposal facilitates both an opportunity for RTD bus and rail operators to vote new work
assignments and the opportunity for Service Development Division staff to adjust the operations plan for
RTD’s transit network.
Currently, weekday boardings average slightly more than 185,000, a 10% increase over the same period
in 2021. Despite growth, overall system capacity remains ample throughout the RTD, with few
exceptions. Customer expectations and agency goals outlined in the Reimagine RTD System
Optimization Plan have driven an interest toward increasing levels of service. However, current
employment levels for bus and rail operators remain a challenge, limiting resources available to operate
increased services. Accordingly, the proposals for May 2023 have been arranged to leverage seasonal
changes to address maintenance needs, resulting in a service proposal composed of a limited number of
service increases and resource neutral adjustments.
DISCUSSION
The proposals herein include a mix of service improvements and adjustments. Notable proposals included
herein include a Reimagine RTD System Optimization Plan (SOP) proposal restructuring the Route 10 –
12th Avenue local service and a proposal to reintroduce select trips on the FF2 – Union Station
Downtown Boulder Express branch of the Flatiron Flyer. This proposal also supports the implementation
of a new North Broomfield FlexRide service area, which is grant funded.
Following the guidelines contained in the Strategic Plan, relating most directly to Customer Excellence
and recognizing the RTD’s workforce challenges, the proposals herein are directed at improving on-time
performance, maintaining CBA compliance and adjusting service levels to match summer ridership
demand.
The Board adopted guidance for proposed service changes continue to be:

Attachment A
May 2023 Service Change Proposal

Route 0 – South Broadway
Current average weekday ridership: 31.5 passengers per hour
Current on-time performance: 77.9% on-time, 18.4% late
It is proposed to add resources to Route 0 on weekdays to alleviate current running time
issues. A running time analysis determined there is a significant delay occurring between
Evans and Englewood Station on weekdays, in comparison with current running times
allotted to that segment. Research comprised of route review, operator interviews and data
analysis determined this delay to be primarily due to heavy passenger loads and traffic signal
timing issues. Resource impacts are anticipated to be an estimated 7 weekday hours.
Route 3L – East Alameda Limited

Current on-time performance 20.8% late, 79.2% on time
Schedule adjustments resulting from running time analysis, aimed at improving on-time
performance are proposed. No cost impacts anticipated.
Route 10 – East 12th Avenue

Current on-time performance 23.9% late, 76.1% on time
Current ridership is 23 boardings per hour weekdays, 20 boardings per hour Saturdays, 16
boardings per hour Sundays
As outlined in the RTD Board-approved System Optimization Plan (SOP), it is proposed to
expand service east into Aurora. However, the routing proposed in the SOP is not compliant
with the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), due to lack of sufficient options for
operator respite at the terminal. To expand service and in compliance with the CBA, it is
proposed to modify the SOP and extend the Route 10 to Colfax and Billings instead, via east
11th Avenue and Peoria Street. Headways to the eastern terminus would be 60 minutes, as
proposed in the SOP.
Further, in accordance with the SOP, all westbound patterns will terminate at Denver Union
Station. This route will no longer serve Decatur-Federal Station or the Children’s Museum
due to lack of ridership compared to the resources required to maintain such routing. The
existing headways will be maintained between Denver Union Station and 9th and Clermont.
This proposal aims to increase ridership by improving transit access and connectivity to
major activity and employment centers in Denver and Aurora. This modified routing complies
with the Collective Bargaining agreement and provides a greater benefit to Title VI
populations, who are more likely to rely on RTD services. This addresses ongoing customer
requests for Route 10 service to return east of Claremont and is warranted based on the
ridership demand on parallel Routes 6, 15, 15L and 121.
Customers who previously utilized service west of Denver Union Station will be impacted.
However, that segment of the route was discontinued with the COVID 19 service changes

and previously accounted for less than 5% of Route 10 ridership. Anticipate resource
impacts are estimated to be 34 weekday hours, 3 vehicles.

Route 20 – 20th Avenue

Current on-time performance 27.2% late, 72.8% on time
Schedule adjustments resulting from running time analysis, aimed at improving on-time
performance are proposed. Additionally, seasonal school tripper service would be
suspended. No cost impacts anticipated.
Route 28 – 28th Avenue
Schedule adjustment aimed at providing a respite period and location for Routes 28 and 32
beyond 26th and Wadsworth. Cost impacts would be shared between Routes 28 and 32
through interlining the services, which is anticipated to be an estimated 19 hours daily and
an additional vehicle.
Route 30 – South Federal
Seasonal adjustment, discontinuing school tripper for summer. No cost impacts anticipated.
Route 32 – 32nd Avenue
Schedule adjustment aimed at providing a respite period and location for Routes 28 and 32
beyond 26th and Wadsworth. Cost impacts would be shared between Routes 28 and 32
through interlining the services, which is anticipated to be an estimated 19 hours daily and
an additional vehicle.
Route 34 – Bruce Randolph Ave
Current average weekday ridership: 27.1 passengers per hour
Current on-time performance: 87.4% on-time, 12.3% late
In order to achieve further compliance with the Collective Bargaining Agreement maintained
between RTD and ATU 1001, it is proposed to extend route 38 east and connect to route
34 at 30th/Downing Station, due to the lack of a Driver’s Relief Station (DRS) at the current
eastern terminal of route 38. Route 34 will be merged into route 38, and the extra recovery
time currently available on route 34 will accommodate the additional running time necessary
to merge the two routes. Eastbound routing will continue on Stout St from 17th St until 32nd
St, at which point they will turn right on Downing, right on California, where it will enter the
station. Westbound routing will leave the station on California and will follow that until
standard routing is resumed with the turn on 15th Street. Discontinued stops will be #19044
and #10945. The new combined route with be named 38 – 38th Ave Crosstown.
Stop Consolidation

Current average daily ridership on Route 34 is 720 Weekdays, 539 Saturdays, 307 Sundays

In conjunction with the proposed combination of the Route 34 and Route 38 and considering the
multimodal street improvements being made on Bruce Randolph Avenue, it is proposed to remove
two stops to improve the efficiency, on-time performance and customer experience on the Route
34. It is proposed to remove Stops 10944 and 10945 on Bruce Randolph Avenue at Fillmore
Street. These are legacy stops, and do not meet current RTD, FTA or ADA stop standards.

Attachment A

This will impact the existing customers that may use these stops, which is estimated to be at
most 8 customers per day. However, since the distance to the next closest stop is less than 0.1
mile, the estimated customer impact is minimal. New stop spacing will meet the standard for local
routes of roughly 0.25 mile between stops. Additionally, this change will make the route more
efficient for other Route 34 customers.

This will mitigate potential bus and bicycle conflicts with the installation of the bikeway along the
corridor.
Route 38 – West 38th Avenue
Current average weekday ridership: 21.9 passengers per hour
Current on-time performance: 79.1 on-time 20.3 late
In order to achieve further compliance with the Collective Bargaining Agreement maintained
between RTD and ATU 1001, it is proposed to extend route 38 east and connect to route
34 at 30th/Downing Station, due to the lack of a Driver’s Relief Station (DRS) at the current
eastern terminal. Route 34 will be merged into route 38, and the extra recovery time
currently available on route 34 will accommodate the additional running time necessary to
merge the two routes. Eastbound routing will continue on Stout from 17th St until 32nd St,
at which point they will turn right on Downing, right on California, where it will enter the

Attachment A

Route 228 – Lafayette/ Louisville/ Broomfield
Schedule adjustments resulting from running time analysis, due to recent route extensions
to Forest Park/Arapahoe and Diamond Circle/Aspen Ridge. In addition, minor routing change
due to adjustment of timepoint from Garfield/ South Boulder Road (Northbound, nearside in
the northbound route direction) to South Boulder Road (Eastbound, far side in the northbound
route direction). This route adjustment allows for a more direct routing along S Boulder Rd
and reduces operational turning movement required. No cost impacts anticipated. No cost
impacts anticipated.
DASH – Boulder/ Lafayette (via Louisville)
Seasonal adjustment, reducing weekday service frequency for summer. No cost impacts
anticipated.
FF – Boulder/Denver
Current On-time performance: 81.8% on-time 18.2% late
FF2 – It is proposed to add three FF2 (Boulder Express) trips, in the eastbound direction at
7:07AM, 7:37AM and 4:15PM from Downtown Boulder Station to address demand during
the peaks. Ridership on the current eastbound FF1 7:15AM and 7:45AM trips average 48%
of the max load or 40 passengers per trip. However, this average is calculated over a 5-day
period while most of the ridership occurs on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. This
creates a higher ridership than the average on these three days, resulting in overloads
regularly on these days. In the PM peak, ridership averages 63 passengers per trip, 9
passengers or about 15% above max load. Over half of this ridership boards before and at
US36 & McCaslin Station. Again, this ridership average also occurs mainly on Tuesdays,
Wednesdays, and Thursdays, creating a higher ridership than the average, on these midweekdays, resulting in regular overloads.
It is also proposed to add three FF2 trips leaving from Union Station at 7:45AM, 4:45PM
and 5:20PM to address demand during the peaks, in the westbound direction. In the
westbound direction. Ridership in the AM peak between 7:30AM and 8:00AM averages 49
passengers per trip. Ridership in the PM peak, between 4:45PM and 5:30PM averages 64%
of max load or 44 passengers per trip. Close to half of this ridership deboards between US36
& McCaslin and Downtown Boulder Station. Again, most of this ridership occurs on
Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays, resulting in higher than the average ridership on
those days, creating overloads on a regular basis. A new eastbound trip at 4:15pm and a
new westbound trip at 5:15pm are also proposed.
FF5- Downtown Boulder/Anschutz
It is proposed to add a 6:30AM eastbound trip, from Downtown Boulder Station to Anschutz
Campus, to address the demand for an 8:00AM shift start-time and to shift the current
7:30AM westbound trip, from Anschutz Campus to Downtown Boulder Station, to a
7:50AM leave time, for interline efficiencies. Ridership on the current 7:30AM trip boards

FLEXRIDE
North Broomfield FlexRide
It is proposed to create a new FlexRide service area in North Broomfield that will operate
weekdays between 9 am and 4 pm to provide transportation alternatives for those affected
by changes to Route 128. The new service area would go as far east as Washington Street,
as far south as 136th Avenue, as far west as US287 and as far north as Lowell. The primary
boundaries would roughly be Washington Street, 144th Ave, 120th St and Baseline Rd
(Hwy 7).
