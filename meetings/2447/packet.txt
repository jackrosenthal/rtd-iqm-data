Board Meeting Date: March 29, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Resolution”), expressing the intent of the Board to
be reimbursed for certain expenses relating to the financing of the FasTracks Project.
BACKGROUND:
The FasTracks financial plan anticipates a 2016 FasTracks bond issuance for approximately $150
million to finance certain components of the FasTracks projects including the District’s Southeast Rail
Extension (SERE) project, I-225, North Metro, Longmont Station, EAGLE and US 36 BRT, Phase 2.
Related costs of issuance of the bonds are also anticipated to be financed through these bonds.
DISCUSSION:
In anticipation of fully funding the SERE project in 2016, certain preliminary expenses are being
incurred today such as right of way acquisition and final design work to facilitate a quick start to the
project once all funding is in place. In order for these preliminary SERE expenses and ongoing
expenses of the other projects listed above to be reimbursed by a future FasTracks bond issuance, a
reimbursement resolution such as the one being recommended must be adopted by the Board.
Once the Federal Small Starts Construction Grant for the SERE project is fully secured, the Chief
Financial Officer will take preliminary actions to arrange for the issuance of FasTracks bonds,
including assembling financial information related to the District and drafting preliminary documents
and a Resolution for issuance of the Bonds. Drafts of these documents and the Resolution
authorizing issuance of the 2016 FasTracks bonds will be brought to the Board for consideration at a
future time.
The Board is being requested, through this Resolution, to express the intent of the Board to be
reimbursed for certain expenses relating to the financing of the FasTracks Project through the future
issuance of FasTracks Bonds.

1.B.1

RTD is receiving the advice of Butler Snow as Bond Counsel in regard to this reimbursement
resolution.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
Principal and interest costs related to the 2016 issuance of FasTracks Bonds are included in the
budget and the FasTracks financial plan adopted by the Board in August 2015.
ALTERNATIVES:
1.
Authorize the attached Resolution No. __, Series of 2016, expressing the intent of the
Board to be reimbursed for certain expenses relating to the financing of the FasTracks
Project. This is the recommended action.
2.
Do not authorize the execution of documents, including the attached Resolution No. __, Series
of 2016, expressing the intent of the Board to be reimbursed for certain expenses relating to
the financing of the FasTracks Project. This is not the recommended action as it would
adversely affect RTD’s ability to proceed with FasTracks projects.

RESOLUTION NO. _____

A RESOLUTION EXPRESSING THE INTENT OF THE
BOARD TO BE REIMBURSED FOR CERTAIN EXPENSES
RELATING TO THE FINANCING OF THE FASTRACKS
PROJECT.
WHEREAS, it is the current intent of the Board of Directors (the
“Board”) of the Regional Transportation District to acquire land for, design and

WHEREAS, the Board currently believes that it is in the best interest
of the District to finance the Project through the execution and delivery of one or
more series of bonds; and
WHEREAS, the Board has determined that it may be necessary to
make capital expenditures to acquire the Project prior to the time that the District
arranges for the specific financing of such Project; and
WHEREAS, it is the Board’s reasonable expectation that when such
financing occurs, the capital expenditures will be reimbursed with the proceeds of
the financing; and
WHEREAS, in order to comply with the provisions of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), it is the Board’s desire that this
resolution shall constitute the “official intent” of the Board to reimburse such
capital expenditures within the meaning of Treasury Regulation §1.150-2.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
OF THE REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT:

connection therewith.
Section 3. The officers, employees and agents of the District shall
take all action necessary or reasonably required to carry out, give effect to and
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and shall take all action
necessary or desirable to finance the Project and to otherwise carry out the
transactions contemplated by the resolution.
Section 4. The officers and employees of the District are hereby
authorized and directed to take all action necessary or appropriate to effectuate the
provision of this resolution.
Section 5. The District shall not use reimbursed moneys for
purposes prohibited by Treasury Regulation §1.150-2(h).

intent” to reimburse expenditures within the meaning of Treasury Regulation
§1.150-2
Section 7. If any section, paragraph, clause or provision of this
resolution shall for any reason be held invalid or unenforceable, the invalidity or
unenforceability of such section, paragraph, clause or provision shall not affect any
of the remaining provisions of this resolution.
Section 8. All acts, orders and resolutions of the Board, and parts
thereof, inconsistent with this resolution be, and the same hereby are, repealed to
the extent only of such inconsistency. This repealer shall not be construed to

Fiscal Policy Statements – Budget Policy 10
DISCUSSION
Attached is the Performance Report for the Fourth Quarter of 2015. These year-to-date measures
provide a framework in which RTD determines how well it provides service to its passengers and
the citizens of the District within its mission statement objectives. Of the 23 performance
measures tracked, RTD met 17 of the goals in their entirety in the third quarter compared to 17 in
the third quarter. The following is a discussion of the exceptions.
Goal 1.1 – Safety Incidents
First Transit-Commerce City was the only carrier to not meet goal in Q4 in the passenger accident
ratio per 100,000 miles. All of the passenger accidents were non-preventable.
Goal 3.1 – System-Wide On-Time Performance
The District as a whole did not meet its goals for on-time service in Q4; performance is stable to
Q3 and on a full-year basis improved over prior year 2014. In Local on-time service, all carriers
met goal except RTD Local and First Transit-Commerce City. Regional & Express on-time service
showed improvement over Q3. Staff will continue its targeted efforts in studying the worst
performing routes and identifying the resources needed to improve, such as service changes and
operator training.
Light Rail on-time service was stable compared to Q3 and 2014.
Goal 4.2 – Level of Customer Complaints
This measure showed a slightly higher level of complaints in Q4 over Q3. Overall system
complaints met goal, but individually, three carriers did not. We have seen customer complaints
increase across the entire system over the past few years due to several factors including the fare
enforcement campaign, the stroller policy, heavy/longer load times, TIC availability, SmartCards,
and lost service arising from the inability to staff all routes due to operator shortages. Staff
continues to review CAD/AVL playbacks to determine the validity of these complaints and to work
with operators to address the valid issues.
In Q4, RTD and First Transit-Longmont met or exceeded goal while First Transit-Commerce City,
Transdev and First Transit-Denver did not meet goal. Staff provides an analysis of complaints as
part of the Operations/Customer Services report.

Packet Pg. 15

1.C.2

5.1 – ADA On-Time Performance
Access-a-Ride on-time service was only slightly down from Q3, again mostly due to challenges in
operator hiring.
Goal 6.2 – Increase Ridership
Ridership in Q4 was down almost 2%. Ridership goal is 0% increase for 2015. Ridership actuals
compared to budget will continue to be evaluated.
Goal 6.5 – Bus Operator/Mechanic Headcount within Authorization
RTD exceeded its vacancies goal in bus operators and bus mechanics. We are experiencing a high
level of vacancies in this category and recruitment is on-going. Human Resources has revised its
hiring practices to include signing and referral bonuses, “one-stop” job fairs, the use of outside
agencies, and advertising. Vacancies are due to retirements, system growth, and the strong local
economy. Bus operator vacancies are declining and we expect an improvement in mechanics
vacancies going forward due to successful hiring at end of year.

average number of days between when a customer contact is entered for action and when the action is completed (closed). The
categories are also added for 2015.

We are experiencing a high level of vacancies in bus mechanics and operators; recruitment efforts are continuing and revised hiring
practices have been implemented, including signing and referral bonuses, “one-stop” job fairs, community/veteran/education job fairs,
and advertising. Vacancies are due to retirements, system growth, and the strong local economy. Bus operator vacancies are declining

Fiscal Sustainability Update

CFO/AGM,

Finance

&

Board Meeting Date: March 22, 2016
Information

BACKGROUND
A Fiscal Sustainability Task Force (Task Force) was formed in November 2010 for the purpose of making
recommendations detailing opportunities for operating efficiencies and revenue enhancement for the
Base System to ensure RTD’s long-term fiscal sustainability. The Task Force consisted of 22 members
with 12 of those members being external to RTD.
The Task Force presented its written
recommendations to the Board of Directors in June 2011. The Board of Directors subsequently
approved those recommendations and directed Staff to pursue implementation of each recommendation.
The Task Force reconvened for a final meeting in July 2012 to be briefed on the progress of their
recommendations and provide an opportunity for feedback.
DISCUSSION
The Task Force made revenue enhancement, expense reduction and fiscal policy recommendations to
the Board of Directors which were approved for further consideration and/or implementation. The
majority of the recommendations made have been completed or their status has not changed since our
last report in October 2015. We continue to report on the status of the Task Force recommendations as
follows:
Recommendations - Completed
Removing the Volatility from Sales and Use Tax Projections
RTD contracted with the University of Colorado, Leeds School of Business – Business Research Division
(Leeds) to provide sales and use tax forecasts beginning in March 2011. Each quarter, Leeds has
provided a forecast containing short-term (one year by quarter), medium-term (six year SBP period) and
long-term (30 year APE period) sales and use tax projections. This was implemented to provide RTD
with expert economic analysis and sales and use tax forecasts using sophisticated financial modeling
techniques not available internally. These forecasts are intended to provide a better analysis of RTD’s
expected sales and use tax collections which comprise approximately 2/3 of RTD’s recurring revenues.
For 2016, the CU contract was renewed for semi-annual forecasts rather than quarterly.
Service Optimization
In 2012, RTD implemented modifications and reductions in service representing approximately $10.7
million or an 8% net reduction in service. Service optimization was recommended by the Task Force and
implemented with Board approval in order to match services provided with available funding sources.
Since that time, service has been gradually restored as needed within budgetary constraints. Service
modifications were brought forward to accommodate the new FasTracks lines opening in 2016 and we
will continue to assess service optimization.

Packet Pg. 28

1.C.3

Fund Balance Policy
Due to the volatility of RTD’s largest single revenue source, sales and use taxes, the Task Force
recommended implementation of a more robust fiscal policy regarding fund balances. Fund balances
represent financial assets that are available to RTD after allowing for obligations that have been incurred.
Fund balances increase when fund sources exceed fund uses and vice versa. Fund balances, therefore,
exist as a form of savings account to be used for specific purposes when needed and replenished when
economic circumstances allow. In response to this recommendation, RTD implemented a fund balance
policy with a target level of $90 million for the Base System, which is approximately three months of
operating expenses. The target fund balance for FasTracks is two months of operating expenses (with
the third month contributed to FISA). These targets were established based on levels recommended by
the Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA) best practices. The Fund Balance Policy further
categorizes the available fund balances into the categories of a Board Restricted Fund, a Capital
Replacement Fund and an Unrestricted Fund. At FYE 12/31/15, preliminary fund balances (net of Net
Pension Obligation and prior to audit adjustments) totaled $78.9 million on the Base system.
Sales and Use Tax Exemptions
In Colorado, legislation establishes products and services that are subject to sales and use taxation and
those that are exempt from taxation. The state, cities, municipalities and special districts in Colorado
each have different sales and use tax rates and often have differing items subject to taxation due to
legislation establishing exemptions. Exemption parity was identified by the Task Force as providing a
benefit to RTD during difficult economic conditions when the state implements exemption changes and
vice versa. In addition, exemption parity removes the complexity to vendors of RTD having different
taxable items than the state. RTD introduced legislation that was passed in May 2013 to establish
parity with the state regarding items subject to sales and use taxation. Exemption parity took effect
1/1/14. RTD estimates that parity generated a net increase of $2.7 million in 2014 based on 2012
figures, however, this is difficult to track due to the way vendors report sales tax components.
Technology and Energy Innovation
RTD conducted a comprehensive energy audit of the oldest and largest operating division (the Platte
facility) to determine the potential scope of savings that may be available through equipment and lighting
upgrades. The audit identified that facility lighting upgrades could result in potentially significant energy
savings. Areas for minor energy savings were identified for other building systems; however, these have
a very significant capital investment and long pay-back periods. RTD budgets for energy upgrades
throughout the District in the Strategic Budget Plan. We will continue to address energy efficiency in
building systems as on-going projects are completed. Facilities Maintenance has completed lighting
upgrades by replacing older metal-halide fixtures with more energy-efficient fluorescent fixtures at the
East Metro, Boulder, District Shops and Platte operating facilities. Solar panels were also installed at the
East Metro facility. Average savings of approximately $50,000 annually have occurred at the East
Metro facility due to the combination of solar and lighting upgrades. The Boulder facility is remaining
even in costs since the lighting upgrades occurred. District Shops is saving $20,000 annually and the
Platte Division is saving over $50,000 annually.
Sales and Use Tax Compliance Reviews
The Colorado Department of Revenue (DOR) collects and audits sales and use taxes for RTD. The Task
Force identified an opportunity for revenue enhancement by performing additional sales and use tax
compliance reviews based on the favorable collection experiences of Colorado cities and municipalities
that implemented these reviews. Compliance reviews consist of RTD providing additional resources
from a contracted provider to supplement the DOR’s audit function and is intended to provide the DOR
with the additional resources necessary to ensure complete and timely tax compliance by vendors. RTD
contracted with Revenue Recovery Group (RRG), an audit firm with substantial experience providing

Packet Pg. 29

1.C.3

compliance review services to several Colorado municipalities, and the program began in April 2014.
While assessments from this effort have exceeded the costs, it has not yet been determined to what
extent those assessments will be collected. RTD staff decided not to extend RRG’s contract beyond
December 31, 2015 due to the limited remaining opportunities for assessments outside of the scope of
work of the DOR.
Recommendations – Ongoing
Naming Rights
In August, the RTD Board approved the first naming rights/corporate sponsorship agreement under the
Board-adopted naming rights policy with the University of Colorado for naming the commuter rail A Line
and creating an advertising presence on the Flatiron Flyer bus rapid transit line. In return, RTD will
receive from the University of Colorado total gross payments of $5 million over the next five years, less
implementation costs and commission, with a possible five year extension if both parties agree. By way
of background, RTD’s naming rights consultant WME/IMG presented to the Board in 2013 an inventory
and financial analysis of RTD facilities, services, and assets that could lend themselves to
naming/sponsorship value-added contracts. WME/IMG completed the valuation of RTD assets and was
given the green light to begin pursuing potential clients, resulting in the public launch of the program in
the third quarter of 2014. Any additional proposed naming rights/corporate sponsorship contracts will
continue to be brought to the RTD Board for approval.
Partnerships and Privatization
The Task Force described this recommendation as a broad area that could include items such as
privatizing routes and administrative and operational functions to reduce expenses. RTD has undertaken
some actions under this recommendation such as the lease of the DUS historic building, IGAs for
improvements to US36 and the East Line, as well as TOD activities. RTD continues to look for
partnership and privatization opportunities on an ongoing basis. RTD has received an unsolicited
proposal regarding its parking facilities that may present further opportunities for working with the
private sector.
Recommendations – Low Priority
The status of recommendations made by the Task Force and categorized at the 2012 Board Retreat as
having lower priority follows:
Charge for Parking
RTD currently charges out-of-District patrons parking fees to use parking facilities as well as fees
charged to in-District patrons parking for longer than 24 hours. The Task Force identified charging
parking fees to all patrons as a possible revenue enhancement source. This recommendation could be
perceived as a fare increase. In 2013, the state legislation regarding RTD charging for parking was
amended to allow a third party to charge in-District patrons as long as RTD receives no revenue.
Tolling and Managed Lanes
The Task Force recommended investigating the possibility of RTD generating additional revenues
through charges for tolling and managed lanes.
Enacting this recommendation would require
coordination with CDOT and other agencies. The US36 BRT project is an example of how tolling and
managed lanes can enhance RTD operations and save costs. The agreement guarantees running times,
allows for bus on shoulder operations to facilitate schedule adherence on local service, and provides for
maintenance of managed lanes with no contribution from RTD. Prior to entering into agreements with
CDOT for managed lanes, RTD contributed to maintenance and snow removal on the I-25 HOV lanes.

Packet Pg. 30

1.C.3

Home Rule Initiative
The Task Force recommended that RTD consider becoming a “Home Rule” entity which would allow
RTD to collect and audit its sales and use taxes instead of the DOR. This initiative would require
legislation. RTD met several times with the DOR to discuss this initiative as well as sales and use tax
compliance reviews. Although the DOR did not object to RTD performing these services itself, the
Colorado Municipal League and other entities recommended against it. “Home Rule” is a state
constitutional authorization for creating municipalities. It could only be secured for RTD by statewide
constitutional amendment. As discussed earlier in this report, RTD has entered into an agreement with
DOR to facilitate better tax compliance and monitoring, which has been coupled with simplification of
state and RTD taxation through legislation that provides for uniformity on items taxed.

Information

The Stored Value MyRide Card is a product that can be purchased by the general public currently
enrolled in the pubic pilot program to pay for transit fares on fixed route buses and rail platforms. Stored
Value is provided on reloadable plastic cards encoded with chips. These cards can be loaded with certain
dollar amounts and used much like a debit card. Once the card is loaded, it can be used to board bus or
rail until the dollar amount on the card is less than the fare needed. Additional value can be loaded onto
the card at RTD retail outlets.
Starting the morning of Monday January 4th, cards were being dispersed to the Public Pilot Riders at the
RTD retail outlets. For the first nine-weeks and as of March 6th, a total of 1,005 cards were issued of
which 760 (76%) were full fare and 245 (24%) were discount cards. The average initial stored value
loading is $43.58 with a total value loaded of $63,900. There have been 13,060 boardings using these
MyRide cards with fare value of $27,900. Of these boardings; 73% were local, 26% regional and 1%
airport.

REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
VIRTEGIC GROUP
AUDIT REPORT # 15-11-12

RTD issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) in an effort to hire a Public Information (PI)
Consultant during the third quarter of 2011, following the expiration of the original PI
Consultant contract. After evaluating responses from interested firms, Virtegic Group
was chosen and entered into a ‘fixed price labor hours, time and materials’ contract with
RTD that expires later this year.
Based on the original bid proposal, if all option years were exercised, the total cost for
Virtegic’s services would approximate $3.8 million over the five year period. This was
significantly lower than the prior provider’s bid and Virtegic was considered to have the
necessary expertise to fulfill the RFP requirements.
AUDIT SCOPE
The Audit Scope included the initial contract awarding process and monthly invoice
submissions over the last twelve months. Tests were performed to validate that
responding vendors were adequately reviewed and evaluated at RTD; the contract was
properly executed; both RTD and Virtegic are in compliance with the contract terms
and conditions, and monthly invoices are reviewed and approved by appropriate RTD
management.
CONCLUSION
Internal Audit concluded that the most favorable bidder was selected and the contract
was properly executed. Invoices contain the required detail from Virtegic Group
including each assigned employee’s hours charged, and accomplishments for the
month. The monthly invoice packages were approved by appropriate individuals within
RTD before payment. However, Accounts Payable did not maintain the signed Invoice
Routing Slip as evidence of approval with the imaged paid invoice.
Finance will convene a ‘working group’ to review the entire invoice routing, approval,
and retention process, in an effort to identify potential efficiencies for all vendors.
CURRENT STATUS
We will review the status of these actions as part of our normal follow-up in 2016.

BACKGROUND SUMMARY

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT) AUDITING
REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
AUDIT REPORT # 15-06-13

The District had not been involved in IT Audits prior to 2015. On the Suggestion of a
Board Member, Internal Audit obtained permission from the General Manager and CEO
to proceed with the inclusion of IT Audits in the Audit Universe from 2015. This meant
inclusion of an audit on the Annual Audit Plan for 2015. The Audit was of a general
nature. IT Audit is different from Internal Audit as it requires specialized knowledge of IT
systems and controls, which is not needed by Internal Audit.
2015 has been a busy year for Internal Audit as we prepare to stretch our limited time
across both fields. In the spring of 2015 Internal Audit attended a week long IT Audit
School in order to refresh our IT Audit skills. In addition we have joined/rejoined the
Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA) and have acquired the
materials that would assist in performing quality IT Audits for RTD.
Information Technology, Cyber Security conducted a very detailed Risk Assessment in
2014, as part of the planning for future IT Audits Internal Audit reviewed the risk
assessment. Internal Audit also conducted research and prepared a one year IT Audit
Plan for 2016, together with an Audit universe for IT Audits that would be utilized for a
further four years. In doing this we have consulted with the IT Department, the Chair of
the Finance, Accounting and Audit Committee (FAAC) and other IT Audit Professionals.

SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES

The scope included determination of the best process for IT Auditing for RTD. Each IT
audit will have a predetermined scope and an appropriate amount of time will be
allocated to completing it.

CONCLUSION

The use of technology in business means that Cyber Security is of utmost importance in
ensuring protection at the right level. Management at all levels need to be involved in
Cyber Security as it is an enterprise-wide risk management issue not just and IT or
Audit issue.

REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
2015 DENVER TRANSIT PARTNERS – DIA
CONTINUOUS MONITORING – INTERIM # 2
AUDIT REPORT # 15-12-15

In early 2007, RTD investigated the option of building two major rail lines using a publicprivate partnership. Significant effort was involved in developing and soliciting a
‘Request for Quotations’ (RFQ) and evaluating the results pertaining to a Design, Build,
Finance, Operate and Maintain Agreement for the East Rail Line to Denver International
Airport.
Denver Transit Partners (DTP) was awarded the contract with the lowest anticipated
cost for the construction phase, and the best overall technical score. Groundbreaking
was initiated in August 2010 and the line is expected to open in April of this current
year. Proposed Change Orders are periodically submitted by DTP for RTD pre-approval
when unplanned circumstances are experienced.
In addition to DTP, RTD contracted directly with Delcan Corporation, a firm hired to
perform ‘Quality Management Oversight Services’ of ongoing FasTracks Construction
efforts. As part of their provided services, Delcan hired a DBE and SBE certified subcontractor, DQP Enterprises, to perform ‘Internal Quality Reviews’ related to
construction activity. DTP and Delcan, both submit monthly invoices to RTD which are
reviewed and approved by various RTD individuals before payment is made to each
respective firm.
SCOPE
Internal Audit performed a limited review of the controls within RTD over both DTP and
Delcan invoice receipt, review, and approval. A sample Change Order from DTP was
also reviewed for adequate controls.
Testing was performed to validate that monthly progress invoices are properly
supported by detailed worksheets. We also ensured that there was evidence of RTD
management review and approval of each invoice package.
CONCLUSION
Based on the results of our limited testing, it appears that monthly progress invoices are
adequately supported by DTP and sufficiently reviewed by appropriate RTD employees.
Internal Audit has reported a concern with the high rate of over $200 per hour, charged
in 2015 by DQP Enterprises, the Quality Auditor that operates under Delcan.

RISK ASSESSMENT
REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
AUDIT REPORT #15-12-16

The key to effectively protecting RTD’s assets and ensuring continued success in achieving the
business objectives is to identify and manage RTD’s risks. Identification of risks ensures that
efforts are focused on the risks that have the most significant impact on RTD.
The Risk Assessment:
 Identifies key risks for the organization.
 Allows prioritization of the risks.
 Provides opportunity to determine significance of risks.
 Provides opportunity to determine how risks are to be handled.
 Provides opportunity to determine RTDs Risk Appetite.
 Allows Internal Audit and RTD Management to determine effective use of limited
resources.
Internal Audit developed and delivered a Risk Assessment Survey to all departments, requiring
completion by the Middle of March 2016. The survey is designed to effectively and efficiently
identify the risks perceived by RTD management and staff and at the same time reveal their
determination of significance and likelihood of occurrence.

SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES
The Risk Assessment covers all departments, divisions and sections of RTD. The surveys were
sent to every department for completion. Internal Audit will prepare a final Audit Risk Universe
which will be used to develop future Audit Plans. The information will also be reviewed by the
Senior Leadership Team and updated annually.

CONCLUSION
Risk Assessment is a continuous process. Audit has obtained Management’s agreement,
researched and designed a survey that would capture the required information and distributed
surveys to all departments. We are currently handling questions from departments and are
available for assistance as needed.
The next steps involve reviewing survey responses, and classifying risks in a manner that would
be representative of RTD as a whole. The Risk Assessment will then be presented to Senior
Management for confirmation of the determination of significance and likelihood. Management
will then be required to review the information to determine RTD’s risk appetite and the efforts in
mitigating the risks. Risk Assessment is a continuous process. The results of the Risk
Assessment Survey could be used throughout the organization.
This report does not require a response.
