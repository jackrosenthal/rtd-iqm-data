BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
January 2022 JEDI Workshop Part 2

Committee Meeting Date:
January 19, 2022

REPRESENTATIVE
MiDian Holmes, 8PM Consulting
WORKSHOP LENGTH
120 minutes
BACKGROUND
In order to have JEDI be a lens through which we operate, the RTD Board needs to have ongoing
workshops to better understand systemic inequities, our own identities, power, and how these intersect.
JEDI is not simply a one-time training but requires ongoing work on the part of the individual. These
workshops will serve as the first step of many as we work to truly represent the passengers and
communities the Board serves.
Workshop #2 will cover privilege, perspective and perception.
