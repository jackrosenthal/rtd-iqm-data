Attachment: RTD Feb 25 BOD Joint Service Overview PPT

So, What is Joint Service?
The Colorado General Assembly, via SB24184, directed the Stateʼs three leading transit entities to use
their statutory authority to collaboratively study how they could deliver the first phase of Front Range
Passenger Rail.
Joint Service is exploring pathways towards delivery of Phase I by a target date of January 1, 2029.

This is a streamlined planning process with the goal of:
➔

Accelerating the timeline to deliver starter service from Denver Union Station to Fort Collins

➔

Reducing costs of delivering service and increasing efficiencies.
◆
Pursuing NW Rail and FRPR independently increases costs and complications with BNSF.

➔

Fostering collaboration amongst Coloradoʼs transit leaders and entities to deliver Passenger Rail
service

1. Introduction
SB-184 Legislation
►

Requires a report concerning a plan to begin providing Front Range Passenger Rail Service no later than January 1, 2029, to the
legislative bodies and Governor. The report shall include an assessment of whether additional revenue is needed to support such
service and, if so, recommended sources of such funding.

►

The plan should seek to implement construction and operation of the RTD’s Northwest Fixed Guideway Corridor, including an
extension of the corridor to Fort Collins as the first phase of Front Range Passenger Rail Service.

Financial Analysis
►

Information contained in this presentation has been prepared to help inform the SB-184 Legislative Report and should be considered
preliminary pending additional technical analysis and project definition. Initial results are intended to support discussion of potential
financing scenarios and provide input to future decision-making.

►

The financial analysis underlying information in this presentation is based on delivering and operating FRPR starter service from
Denver Union Station to Fort Collins. It aggregates available project cost and revenue information supplied by Colorado Department
of Transportation (CDOT), Regional Transportation District (RTD), and external project consultants.

Analysis outputs are generally dependent on the maturity and accuracy of the technical analysis supplying the model inputs as well as the
funding assumptions used therein. The project is at an early stage of planning and design, and therefore the model outputs are subject to
refinement.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Certificates of Participation, Series 2015A Refinancing

February 11, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
February 25, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the RTD Board of Directors to adopt the attached Resolution Number ____ (the “COP Resolution”),
Series of 2025 authorizing the refinancing of Certificate of Participation (COP) Series 2015A.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Brenden Morgan, Senior Manager, Debt and Investments
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD primarily utilizes sales tax bonds and certificates of participation (COPs), when necessary, as
financing mechanisms to provide funding for certain purchases of assets with useful lives in excess of
one year. Sales tax bonds are subject to Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TABOR) limitations and debt service
payments are secured by future collections of sales and use taxes. COPs are lease-purchase
arrangements and are not subject to TABOR limitations, however, COPs require annual appropriation by
the Board through the budgeting process to authorize annual principal and interest payments. COPs are
secured through collateralization of essential assets of the district. Bonds and COPs are referred to as
RTD debt for discussion purposes.
All of RTD’s debt has fixed interest rates, meaning that the interest rate paid on the portfolio of debt
does not vary with market changes. In addition, RTD’s debt has fixed terms of maturity and is not
subject to acceleration meaning that all debt payments will occur on a fixed schedule through the term
of each obligation. These features provide budget certainty as well as limit RTD’s interest rate risk.
RTD’s debt portfolio contains obligations that are either tax-exempt or taxable. Taxable debt results in
interest payments to debt holders being subject to income tax while tax-exempt debt is generally nontaxable. Taxable debt generally has a higher cost to RTD than tax-exempt debt due to the difference in
interest rates at the time of issuance. Taxable debt is issued instead of tax-exempt debt in situations
that are advantageous to RTD but do not meet the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requirements to be
issued as tax-exempt.
As of December 31, 2024, RTD’s total outstanding bonds and COPs totaled $2.804 billion.

Packet Pg. 67

15.A

In addition, RTD has other long-term obligations associated with the Eagle Public Private Partnership
(P3), which is the design, build, finance, operate and maintain concessionaire agreement entered with
Denver Transit Partners/Operators for the A, B and G Commuter Rail Lines and the Commuter Rail
Maintenance Facility (CRMF), totaling $0.510 billion.
DISCUSSION
RTD and its Municipal Advisor, Hilltop Securities, constantly monitor market conditions for opportunities
for efficiencies regarding RTD’s finances. Current market conditions for debt have created an opportunity
to lower future interest expense.
RTD generally issues tax-exempt debt with 10-year call provisions to provide future flexibility for which
refinancing is permitted at the call date. Current IRS regulations do not permit advance refinancing (prior
to the call date) of tax-exempt debt obligations unless more expensive taxable debt is used.
The Series 2015A COPs were issued for equipment purchases, including light rail vehicles, mall shuttles,
60-foot articulated buses and 40-foot buses. These COPs are eligible for refinancing and current market
conditions indicate that refinancing for interest savings would generate savings of approximately $15.4
million through 2040. These savings are equivalent to net present value (NPV) savings of $4.1 million or
3.84%.
The attached Resolution allows the issuance of Certificates of Participation, Series 2025 to refinance the
currently outstanding Series 2015A COPs.
Substantially final drafts of the contractual documents are on file and available for review on the RTD
Investor Information webpage under the “Documents for Potential 2025 Certificates of Participation”.
The webpage can be found at the following link: https://www.rtd-denver.com/open-records/financialinformation
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Refinancing the Series 2015A COPs is estimated to reduce RTD’s gross interest expense by $15.4
million through 2040 or $4.1 million or 3.84% on an NPV basis. This equates to cash flow savings of
more than $900,000 annually through 2040.

general obligation or other indebtedness or multiple fiscal year financial obligation of the District
within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory provision, nor a mandatory charge or
requirement against the District in any ensuing fiscal year beyond the then current fiscal year.
The District shall have no obligation to make any payment with respect to the 2025 Certificates
except in connection with the payment of the Base Rentals and certain other payments under the
Lease, which payments may be terminated by the District in accordance with the provisions of
the Lease. Neither the Lease nor the 2025 Certificates shall constitute a mandatory charge or
requirement of the District in any ensuing fiscal year beyond the then current fiscal year or
constitute or give rise to a general obligation or other indebtedness or multiple fiscal year
financial obligation of the District within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory debt
limitation and shall not constitute a multiple fiscal year direct or indirect District debt or other
financial obligation whatsoever. No provision of the Lease or the 2025 Certificates shall be
construed or interpreted as creating an unlawful delegation of governmental powers nor as a
donation by or a lending of the credit of the District within the meaning of Sections 1 or 2 of
Article XI of the Colorado Constitution. Neither the Lease nor the 2025 Certificates shall
directly or indirectly obligate the District to make any payments beyond those budgeted and
appropriated for the District's then current fiscal year.
Section 8.
Reasonableness of Rentals. The Board hereby determines and
declares that the Base Rentals due under the Lease, in the maximum amounts authorized
pursuant to Section 3 hereof, constitute the fair rental value of the 2025 Leased Property and do
not exceed a reasonable amount so as to place the District under an economic compulsion to
renew the Lease or to exercise its option to purchase the 2025 Leased Property pursuant to the
Lease. The Board hereby determines and declares that the period during which the District has
an option to purchase the 2025 Leased Property (i.e., the entire maximum term of the Lease)
does not exceed the useful life of the 2025 Leased Property.
Section 9.
Exercise of Option; Direction to Trustee. In the event that the
General Manager or the Chief Financial Officer determines to proceed with the Refunding
Project and executes a Sale Certificate in accordance with the provisions set forth herein, the
Board hereby elects and hereby declares its intent to exercise on the behalf and in the name of
the District its option to purchase all of the 2015A Leased Property currently encumbered under
the 2015A Indenture and to redeem all of the outstanding 2015A Certificates (the "Refunded
Certificates"), as applicable, on the redemption date and at the redemption prices set forth in the
Sale Certificate related to the Refunding Project. Upon the execution of the Sale Certificate
related to the Refunding Project, the District hereby irrevocably instructs the Trustee to give
notice of refunding and defeasance to the owners of the Refunded Certificates in accordance with
the provisions of the Sale Certificate, the Indenture of Trust related to the Refunded Certificates
and the Escrow Agreement between the Corporation and the Trustee, as escrow agent, related to
the Refunded Certificates.
Section 10.
No Recourse against Officers and Agents. Pursuant to Section 1157-209 of the Supplemental Act, if a member of the Board, or any officer or agent of the District
acts in good faith, no civil recourse shall be available against such member, officer, or agent for
payment of the principal, interest or prior redemption premiums on the 2025 Certificates. Such
recourse shall not be available either directly or indirectly through the Board or the District, or
otherwise, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute, rule of law, enforcement of penalty, or

provision of this Resolution or the documents hereby authorized and approved (other than
provisions as to the payment of Base Rentals by the District during the Lease Term, provisions
for the quiet enjoyment of the 2025 Leased Property by the District during the Lease Term and
provisions for the conveyance of the 2025 Leased Property to the District under the conditions

(FTA) Funding

February 11, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
February 25, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve Resolution No. ______, Series of 2025, authorizing the General
Manager and CEO to be responsible for applying for and legally committing RTD to compliance with
terms of awards from the Federal Transit Administration (FTA).
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD is a direct recipient of federal grant funding from the FTA. Eligibility for being a direct recipient of
federal funding requires certain qualifications, certifications, registrations, and authorizations granted by
the FTA. Application, expenditure, and receipt of federal grant funding is subject to several compliance
and reporting requirements as well as regular engagement and coordination with the FTA Region 8
Office.
RTD has internal policies and procedures for applying for grant opportunities regarding planned activities.
Therefore, the agency is strategic in its approach to considering and pursuing grant funding.
On December 6, 2024, RTD received notification from the FTA that certain enhancements will be
required for recipients to apply for and continue receiving FTA funding effective March 5, 2025. These
enhancements include:
•
•

Opinion of Counsel: Each recipient must be legally empowered to carry out the activities specified
in the award
Authorizing Resolution: Each recipient organization must have a resolution or equivalent, from the
recipient’s Board of Directors or equivalent Authorizing Official, to be responsible for applying for
assistance and legally committing the applicant or recipient to compliance with terms of an award

DISCUSSION
In adopting this recommended action, the agency demonstrates its commitment to meet the Strategic
Priority of Financial Success.

Packet Pg. 94

Dear Colleague:
FTA is pleased to announce the release of a recent enhancement in TrAMS, FTA’s grants
management system of record, specific to the organization and labeling of recipient documents.
As you are aware, one of the prerequisites to be a recipient of FTA funding is demonstrating
legal capacity to carry out the project(s) included in federal assistance awards. This is generally
based on the review of the recipient organization’s documentation and certification that it has the
legal capacity to carry out FTA-funded programs and projects. Specifically, the recipient must be
eligible and authorized under state or local law to request, receive, and spend FTA funds to
administer FTA-assisted projects.
•

Opinion of Counsel: Each recipient must be legally empowered to carry out the
activities specified in the award.

•

Authorizing Resolution: Each recipient organization must have a resolution or
equivalent, from the recipient’s Board of Directors or equivalent Authorizing Official, to
be responsible for applying for assistance and legally committing the applicant or
recipient to compliance with terms of an award.

This enhancement provides updated document labels within the Recipient Document profile
module for these two required documents, as well as includes an enhanced search functionality
for all users to find important documents that may be uploaded in their profile. In an effort to
assist with the rollout of this enhancement, TrAMS has attempted to proactively label any
documents that were named using these terms for the recipient. However, all recipients are
asked to review and confirm that the correct document was properly labeled by the system.
Additionally, if the system was unable to locate a document labeled using these terms, recipients
must locate and properly identify both documents within their Recipient profile.
Beginning March 5, 2025, TrAMS will prevent any recipients that have not properly identified
the Opinion of Counsel and Authorizing Resolution in their Recipient Document profile from
transmitting or submitting new applications unless they have correctly labeled and/or uploaded
their required legal documents.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Light Rail Vehicle Cameras Retrofit

February 12, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
February 25, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO or her designee to enter into a
contract with Confluence Security for the purchase and installation of forward-facing, operator-facing incab, and customer compartment cameras on 157 light rail vehicles for a total cost not to exceed
$3,000,000.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Dave Jensen, Assistant General Manager, Rail Operations
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
In accordance with 49 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 674, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA)
has delegated its safety oversight responsibilities to the Colorado Public Utilities Commission (CPUC),
which is the State Safety Oversight (SSO) agency responsible for the oversight of safety and security of
rail fixed guideway systems within the state of Colorado.
Effective June 30, 2022, pursuant to CPUC Rule 7349(b), as a Rail Transit Agency (RTA), RTD was
required to use cameras currently installed in its light rail vehicles (LRVs) to record activity at all times
when the light rail vehicle power is on. This footage must be used to assist in the management of safe
light rail operations, including in accident investigations, whether performed by CPUC staff or the RTA.
Rule 7349(b) also requires that no later than June 30, 2027, RTAs must install and use forward-facing
and operator-facing in-cab cameras on all LRVs for the above purposes.
DISCUSSION
On November 7, 2024, RTD issued a solicitation for LRV cameras and camera installation to replace
existing cameras. The solicitation was made available on the RTD website and advertised on RTD’s
online procurement portal. Proposals were due December 20, 2024. Two proposals were received during
the solicitation period. A panel of subject-matter experts assessed the proposals using pre-determined
objective evaluative criteria. Based on the overall evaluations of the proposals, the panel recommends
awarding the contract to Confluence Security.
This recommended action aligns with 2021-2026 Strategic Plan priorities of Community Value,
Customer Excellence, and Financial Success by improving the agency’s ability to investigate events,
accidents, and criminal incidents and to increase public and employee safety and security on LRVs.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding is included in the 2025 Budget for the provision of replacing existing cameras with forwardfacing and operator-facing in-cab cameras in LRVs.

the fiscal year ended. The Board of Directors shall cause such other audits to be made as it deems
necessary, utilizing the Internal Audit staff or independent auditor as it alone shall determine.” In
addition, as a recipient of over $1,000,000 annually of federal grant funding, RTD is required by the
Single Audit Act of 1984 and certain debt and lease covenants to have an independent audit of other
selected information. Additional services include an annual review of information provided for the
National Transit Database as well as a review of the General Manager and CEO’s employment contract.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
2025 Access-on-Demand Funding

February 12, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
February 25, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO or her designee to provide
additional funding of $15,814,441 for the Access-on-Demand program, raising the not-to-exceed
amount from $21.9 to $37.8 million, and delegating authority to amend the contracts with existing
providers to increase the current amount of program funding for the remainder of the term of the
contracts, which expire December 31, 2025.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Fred Worthen, Assistant General Manager, Bus Operations
Paul Hamilton, Director, Paratransit Services
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD and its contractor partners deliver multimodal transit services across a 2,345 square-mile service
area, which services include bus, light rail, commuter rail, and micro transit services, as well as Accessa-Ride complementary paratransit services in accordance with the requirements of the Americans with
Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA).
In November 2020, RTD launched its Access-on-Demand service as part of an expanded premium to
Access-a-Ride paratransit service. Access-on-Demand began as a supplemental demand-response pilot
program in partnership with Uber, a private transportation network company (TNC). The program’s goal
was to provide a responsive, on-demand platform for paratransit customers, which was similar to the
agency’s Access-a-Cab program as it existed at that time. The Access-a-Cab program provided
alternative on-demand service to paratransit customers through private taxicab providers.
The Access-on-Demand pilot program provided eligible customers a per-trip subsidy of up to $20, and
those customers were required to pay the first $2 in fare for each trip. Access-a-Ride customers within
four ZIP codes, selected for their density of existing paratransit customers, were eligible to participate in
this pilot. The program hours were between 6 and 9 a.m. and between 2 and 5 p.m. The program was
later expanded to an additional three ZIP codes and was expanded again to serve customers 24 hours a
day, seven days a week. During the pilot period, RTD continued to offer its Access-a-Cab demandresponse service, for which a $12 subsidy was offered, and customers were required to pay $2 in fare
for each trip.

Packet Pg. 106

16.E

Following the Board’s approval of funding in November 2022 in the amount of approximately $9.3
million, in January 2023, RTD merged the Access-on-Demand and Access-a-Cab programs. Since then,
RTD has partnered with four contracted private providers, Uber, Lyft, Metro Taxi, and zTrip, to provide
Access-on-Demand service. Customers travel using their choice of these providers, receive a subsidy of
up to $25 per trip, and pay no upfront fare. Additionally, customers schedule trips through the four
providers’ mobile apps or the RTD Access-a-Ride call center for Metro Taxi or zTrip. Customers are
limited to 60 one-way trips per month across all providers and are responsible for monitoring their trip
usage.
Due to the popularity of Access-on-Demand as an alternative to traditional paratransit services, demand
for service quickly exceeded expectations following the expansion beyond the pilot program in January
2023. Key factors driving the increase in demand likely include the same-day convenience when booking
an Access-on-Demand trip, expanded service times and service area when compared with Access-aRide, and no out-of-pocket cost to customers. As a result, RTD anticipates that Access-on-Demand trip
cost subsidies for calendar year 2024 will reach $11.1 million, a 77 percent increase over subsidy costs
in 2023 (at the time of this report development all third-party costs for 2024 have yet to be reconciled).
To ensure customers continue to have equitable and sustainable access to the agency’s services, RTD
commissioned a peer review of the agency’s paratransit service delivery. This on-site review was
conducted by industry subject-matter experts (SMEs) in May 2024. These SMEs engaged in a holistic
review of the paratransit program, including both the Access-on-Demand program and the Access-a-Ride
program. Peer review recommendations, coupled with paratransit customer feedback, will assist RTD in
adopting industry best practices, understanding the agency’s strengths and opportunities concerning
paratransit service delivery, and determining options for potential improvements, sustainability, and fiscal
responsibility.
DISCUSSION
In considering this recommended action, the agency seeks to meet the Strategic Priority of Customer
Excellence.
The Board approved an additional $8,600,000 in June 2024 to fund Access-on-Demand, and the
GM/CEO approved an additional $2,000,000 in December 2024, which sustains the program through
February 2025. Based on projected continual growth in demand for Access-on-Demand services, and
until sustainability recommendations of the peer review committee may be vetted and adopted, an
additional $15,814,441 is requested to continue to provide Access-on-Demand services through
December 2025 when the third-party contracts expire.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Additional funding for the Access-on-Demand program in the amount of $13,814,440 will be derived
from existing funds in the 2025 budget, and the remaining $2,000,000 will be made available through
the unrestricted reserve. Future funding for this program will be allocated through the annual budget
process.

Committee Meeting Date:
Contracted Security Services

February 12, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
February 25, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the summary scope of work for a solicitation for security services.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Glyn Horn, Acting Co-Chief, Transit Police and Emergency Management
Michael Millage, Senior Manager, Commuter Rail Contract Services
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
The current RTD security model consists of internal police officers, secondary employment police
officers from local jurisdictions, and contracted security officers to provide security for RTD employees,
customers, facilities, and property, as well as federally required commuter rail second crewmember
duties.
On July 11, 2019, following a comprehensive procurement process, Allied Universal Security Services
was awarded a three-year contract with three one-year options to provide system-wide security
services. The initial contract term expired June 30, 2022, and following three separate Board approvals,
RTD executed each of three additional one-year contract options. The third and final option year term
expires June 30, 2025. No additional contract options remain.
To continue to augment the overall security model with contracted security services, RTD staff will
publish a competitive solicitation for services to begin July 1, 2025.
DISCUSSION
If approved, staff will prepare a solicitation seeking contracted security services consistent with the
below summary scope of work.
In adopting this recommended action, the agency seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan priorities
of Community Value and Customer Excellence. Specifically:
• The perceived value of RTD in terms of Community Value would be enhanced through
recruitment and retention of contracted security personnel to support RTD Police throughout the
District yielding a greater sense of employee, customer, and overall community security in areas
RTD serves

Packet Pg. 109

16.F

• Increased Customer Excellence would be achieved through the continued ability of Commuter Rail
Contracted Services to deploy unarmed security guards on commuter rail services, thereby
improving system reliability and decreasing delays
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The contracted services funding for this contract is included in the 2025 Budget.

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Julien Bouquet, Board Chair
Debra Johnson, General Manager and CEO
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD developed its Board-adopted 2024 Legislative Program to serve as a guiding document for staff to
pursue goals related to legislative and policy matters. A Legislative Program serves as a living document
that can be adjusted throughout a legislative session to provide an avenue for Board-adopted policy
positions to be communicated and pursued by agency staff.
SB161 was introduced on Tuesday, February 11, 2025, and assigned to the Senate Transportation and
Energy Committee. The full text of the bill is appended to this report.
DISCUSSION
Provided below for the purposes of discussion by the Board of Directors is a section-by-section summary
of SB161.
•

Section 1 – Legislative declaration

•

Section 2 – Adds language stating the Board of Directors has the authority to enter into service
partnership agreements. RTD currently has the authority to enter into service partnership
agreements such as agreements related to service in Boulder County or any of the agencies
Partnership Program service agreements

•

Section 3 – Directs RTD to align with goals set in the state’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Target,
establish employee retention goals, and develop performance measures to evaluate progress
related thereto; and to follow federal regulations related to assaults on transit workers

•

Section 4 – Requires RTD to:

•

Sections 6 and 8 – Add two ex officio Directors to the Board of Directors and establish a process
for ex officio Director vacancies

•

Section 7 – Prohibits write-in candidates for the Board of Directors

•

Section 9 – Within the Colorado Energy Office, creates an accountability committee, comprised
of appointed members external to the agency along with two ex officio members of the Board of

submitted to the General Assembly by January 30, 2026

FINANCIAL IMPACT
As introduced, SB161 requires RTD to produce a ten-year strategic plan, a comprehensive operational
analysis beyond the scope of current staff planning, update service standards, and create new public
information dashboards beyond current requirements in state law. Staff has not determined which, if
any, of these tasks can be completed in house without appropriated funding authorization. Funding
sources to complete these requirements have not been identified and will need to be addressed on a
case-by-case scenario; the 2025 Budget or external grant opportunities are potential funding sources for
one or more of these requirements.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Review of 2025 Committee Approved Work Plans

February 25, 2025

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Jack Kroll, Executive Manager, Board Office
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
At the January 30, 2024, regular Board meeting, the Board of Directors approved a Bylaw amendment,
which calls for each standing committee of the Board to draft and approve an annual work plan. The
work plans approved by each committee will cover meetings from March 2025 to February 2026.
Annual committee work plans are a useful tool for ensuring the Board and staff collaborate effectively to
accomplish the necessary work of the agency and Board, while providing dedicated space for the Board
to pursue governance/policy objectives and gain further insights into matters of interest to Directors.
Work plans elevate and respect the role of the committees of the Board as some of the most effective
forums for completing the work of the Board.
Subsequently the Finance & Planning, Operations, Safety, and Security, Performance, and Executive
committees have each approved a work plan for 2025.
DISCUSSION
The Board is asked to review the work plans and provide any additional input to the committees as those
committees proceed in their work for the balance of 2025.
This discussion aligns with the Strategic Priorities of Community Value, Customer Excellence, Employee
Ownership, and Financial Success, as the ability of the Board’s standing committees to effectively
govern directly impacts the overall performance of the agency. Organized committee work plans will
ensure RTD’s resources are used efficiently, and that the Board’s policy and governance objectives are
more focused, collaborative, and obtainable.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact to the review of the committee work plans.
