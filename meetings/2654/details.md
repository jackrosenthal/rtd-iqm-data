Ms. Silva advised the Board that the 2016 Civil Rights Annual Report was completed and she would be providing a copy to each of the Directors.  She gave a brief overview of the report which included highlights of the Civil Rights division.

2016     Highlights of the Year:

- In collaboration with bus ops, facilities, capital programs, etc., an effective checklist was created for bus stop accessibility district-wide which will bring RTD into compliance with Federal Transit Administration (FTA) regulations.

- The American Disability Association (ADA) office received a Shalom of Denver Hero Award for efforts and assistance coordinating efforts to grant a 1-year of Access-a-Ride services to disabled patrons.

- Brought on an additional Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Specialist to assist with protected class investigations and EEO trainings.

- In accordance with FTA, EEO office created and implemented a process to review Subrecipients’ EEO Program Plans

- Implemented an effective process of monitoring and reporting the RTD’s workforce utilization analysis reporting to the RTD CEO, Senior Leadership as well as HR recruitment staff.

- The Small Business Office (SBO) successfully completed the FTA Triennial DBE Goal and Methodology for FFY 2017-2019 proposing a 24% agency-wide DBE goal. As part of the goal methodology, SBO consulted one-on-one with all the local chambers and organizations that represent small businesses and hosted a public forum. RTD has received another successful FTA Concurrence of the Triennial Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) Goal.

- Base system and FasTracks DBE/SBE goals were achieved for 2016, and many FasTracks projects that closed during 2016 exceeded their DBE/SBE commitments.

- The WIN Program was selected to be a part of the FTA’s National Workforce Grantee Summit “Implementing, Disseminating & Modeling Ladders of Opportunity”. The Summit was held in Washington, D.C. in the U.S. Department of Transportation’s (USDOT) offices

- The WIN Program executed two Intergovernmental Agreements with each founding partner of the WIN Program. This major milestone is for a primary use of the federal grant that WIN was awarded as well as solidifying the continuance of the WIN Programs’ vision for creating a skilled and trained workforce to enter RTD

Ms. Silva also briefly touched base on meetings that Civil Rights’ staff members conducted or attended in 2016.  In closing Ms. Silva presented the goals of the Civil Rights’ division moving forward.

Director Anderson asked if the WIN program provided outreach to Adams and Jefferson County.

Ms. Silva replied that the WIN program has participated in several panels to reach out to high school students about careers in transportation.

Director Anderson asked if there is a continuing issue regarding assistance animals.  Ed Neuberg, ADA Manager, said that service animals are still an on-going issue.

Director Folska asked Ms. Silva how the $200,000 contribution to the WIN program will be utilized.

Ms. Silva explained that the WIN program was originally designed to train WIN participants within the District to work on construction projects.  Civil Rights staff will recruit participants but anyone is eligible to apply.  She informed the Board that there are limited projects for the participants at this time; however they have hired some personnel through the program.  She stated that the Community College of Denver along with the Urban League of Metro Denver both help the WIN program in their recruiting efforts.  The recruitment process accesses the applicants and determines what training is needed.

Director Folska asked Ms. Silva if there are recruitment efforts for people with disabilities.

Ms. Silva and Martell Dyles, Manager of WIN, confirmed that some classes were offered through Atlantis Community Inc.  She stated that they are shifting their energy from construction industry jobs to bus and rail operators to assist RTD with recruitment efforts.

Mr. Dyles explained that the WIN program helps all individuals that come through the program regardless of race or disability.  He stated that WIN has made changes in the program to accommodate those with disabilities.

Director Folska asked Mr. Dyles and Ms. Silva if they could provide a list of organizations that they partner with, that work with people with disabilities.

Director Williams said that she was under the impression that the reason we are having problems with recruitment is because of the union’s commitment to a set number of hours per week.  She asked if shorter shifts could be offered to the drivers.

General Manager Genova stated that there are part-time positions and the Union does utilize part-time operators.

Director Williams asked if the new ADA committee is a stand-alone.

Ms. Silva responded that the goal is to only have two ADA committees at RTD.  She stated that it is very important to retain the ADA Paratransit Advisory Committee (APAC) committee as a stand-alone committee.  She explained how they are going to terminate the design panel committee and absorb some of those committee members.  She said that her team has put a lot of work in creating a protocol and setting a criteria before they go out.  The second committee has a working group, steering committee and an external advising committee to provide input.  The external advising committee will bring issues or concerns to the steering committee and they then commute that to the working group.

Director Williams asked if the Board gets reports from those meetings every month.

Ms. Silva stated that APAC meets every other month and a meeting facilitator has been hired.  She said that there are things to report throughout the year but not necessarily every other month.  She stated that in moving forward there will be discussions as to what is appropriate to report to the Board.

Director Williams mentioned that there were people volunteering their time from various parts of the community that would like to know that their input is heard by the Board.

Director Sisk thanked Ms. Silva and the Civil Rights team.  He stressed his appreciation for John Thompson with DTP, and stated that his contributions to the WIN program are noteworthy and deserves accolades.

Director Tisdale stated that workforce development is the number one issue facing economic development and developers, it is not just RTD it is everyone.  He said the WIN program is a great contribution to addressing workforce development.  He explained that Community College of Denver has been a great partner and they are committed to this.  He applauded DTP, RTD and CCD for their partnership efforts.

Director Francone thanked Mr. Thompson.  She noted that the Annual Report stated that Civil Rights was going to hire a new EEO Manager.  She asked if that was in addition to whom they already have or if they are replacing a position.

Ms. Silva stated that the Civil Rights division is replacing someone.

Director Folska asked if people with disabilities have been included in the on-board, off-board surveys and the customer service satisfaction survey.

Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager of Planning, stated that commuters were selected at random.

Director Folska asked if the surveys included paratransit services.

Mr. Van Meter responded that the surveys only included fixed rate services.

Director Folska asked if paratransit services encompass 10% of RTD’s operating budget.

General Manager Genova said he would research and provide exact numbers later to the Board.

Director Menten asked what part of the annual budget goes towards the WIN program.

Ms. Silva explained that with every grant that RTD receives there has to be a match component.  She stated that there is a memorandum of understanding with the Community College of Denver and Urban League of Denver stating that some of the funds are in-kind and participants hired will specifically perform WIN program work.  She agreed that it is a bit cumbersome and stated that her team will be happy to sit down and explain more in detail to Director Menten.

Director Menten asked if the WIN program employs 50 participants a year.

Ms. Silva stated that the number fluctuates depending on the projects WIN is involved with, as people are hired based on project goals.  Mr. Dyles noted that hiring can vary from 20-180 people a year depending on the construction projects.

### D. Other Matters

Director Folska informed the Board that former Chair Tom Tobiassen will be honored on Friday, March 10th, 2017 by the Aurora Chamber of Commerce, as Man of the Year.

Chair Hoy thanked everyone that participated last Saturday at the retreat.  He said that they accomplished a lot and he was pleased with the participation and the results.
