B.

Budget Transfer for Commuter Rail Third Party Services

It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the RTD
Board of Directors approve a budget transfer of $2.82 million from the FasTracks
Management Reserve to the commuter rail operations budget for third party
reimbursable projects to allow RTD to compensate Denver Transit Partners (DTP) for
costs it will incur for work associated with third party agreements. The FasTracks
Management Reserve will be replenished in the 2018 Amended Budget with the funds
that will be received from third parties to compensate RTD for the impacts to its
operation.
This action addresses two of the General Manager’s goals for 2018: Core Goal #1 –
Successful Delivery of Transit Services, and Task Goal #1 – Fiscal Sustainability.
