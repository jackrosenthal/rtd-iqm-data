2017 CAFR and Report to Governance

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors accept and enter into the record the District’s audited financial reports relating to
the year ended December 31, 2017 as prepared by staff and audited by RTD's
independent auditor, RubinBrown, LLP.
GM CORE AND TASK GOALS MET
Core Goal #3: Strong Financial Management
Task Goal #1: Fiscal Sustainability
B.

Budget Transfer for Commuter Rail Third Party Services

It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the RTD
Board of Directors approve a budget transfer of $2.82 million from the FasTracks
Management Reserve to the commuter rail operations budget for third party
reimbursable projects to allow RTD to compensate Denver Transit Partners (DTP) for
costs it will incur for work associated with third party agreements . The FasTracks
Management Reserve will be replenished in the 2018 Amended Budget with the funds
that will be received from third parties to compensate RTD for the impacts to its
operation.
This action addresses two of the General Manager’s goals for 2018: Core Goal #1 –
Successful Delivery of Transit Services, and Task Goal #1 – Fiscal Sustainability.

employee, the General Manager, and he added that the General Manager’s issues
and successes are the Board’s issues and successes.
Committee Walker announced that the committee meeting was being videotaped.
He stated that the day’s mission was narrow.

B. GM Oversight & Performance Management Committee Background/Overview
Committee Chair Walker briefly reviewed the history of the General Manager
Oversight and Performance Management Committee (GM Oversight). He said
the legislature felt that RTD’s General Manager required more oversight,
which lead to the creation of the committee to perform that duty.
Director Broom asked whether the committee reported to the legislature.
Committee Chair Walker responded that the committee did not report to the
legislature out of obligation.
Chair Tisdale added that the committee was formed as a result of a state
audit.
Director Folska, Ph.D., noted that RTD reported periodically to the
Transportation Legislation Review Committee (TLRC) and stated that RTD’s
General Managers have given presentations to that committee.
Committee Chair Walker stated that his understanding was that RTD’s
interaction with TLRC was to present information on the agency as a whole,
rather than a report on the General Manager’s performance.
Director Folska, Ph.D., agreed that RTD’s involvement with TLRC might not
be obligatory.

 Committee Background

6.A

Director Hoy noted that he would not be able to attend the committee
meeting scheduled for May 17.
Committee Chair Walker noted that the binders also included a timeline he
and Barbara McManus, Executive Manager of the Board Office, had put
together. He said the timeline denoted which person or group would be
required to take action on certain dates. He stated that no Directors had
commented on the revised version of the timeline that was distributed the
previous week.

Committee Chair Walker said that the committee was in the process of
reviewing the General Manager’s goals for 2018, which was a process that
was carried over from 2017. He said that Market Research Manager Dennis
Yaklich, Ms. McManus, and he were working on a survey that would
capture the evaluative criteria for the General Manager’s goals.
Ms. McManus noted that the draft survey was included under the eighth tab
of the binder.
Committee Chair Walker said that the survey would be sent out to Directors
soon and that every Director was expected to fill it out in order to provide
guidance to the General Manager. He said the process would be repeated
toward the end of the year, followed by an opportunity to discuss the
General Manager’s performance for the entire year.
Ms. McManus reviewed the survey changes. She said Directors had
commented that the previous year’s survey questions were not structured in
a way that yielded effective results.
Committee Chair Walker added that the current year survey’s questions had
been changed so as to directly correlate with the General Manager’s core
goals.
Ms. McManus said that the General Manager’s tactical plan and the priorities
identified at the joint Board/SLT retreat followed the same alignment. She
said the survey was modeled to follow that same alignment, which would
give Directors the opportunity to request specific information and materials
to assist them in determining their individual assessment of the General
Manager’s performance by the end of the year.

D. Review Performance Evaluation Process & Mapping

6.A

Director Broom noted that some Directors did not complete a survey in
2017.
Ms. McManus said she was aware of three Directors who did not complete
their surveys.

Ms. McManus said that, of the three Directors who did not fill out a survey,
only one was a member of GM Oversight.
Committee Chair Walker agreed with Director Broom and said he did not
think people should be on the Board if they were not willing to fulfill all of
the duties required of Directors. He said there would be opportunities in the
survey responses to provide subjective assessments on areas in which the
General Manager could improvement and in which he exceeded
expectations. He said that the Directors all observed different things with
respect to the General Manager’s performance, and he stated that certain
Directors might not be in tune with certain aspects of the performance
criteria.
Director Menten asked whether the responses of “not sure” or “needed
information” were new additions to the survey.
Ms. McManus responded that the previous survey included a response that
stated the Director did not have enough information to answer the question.
She said the new survey would include responses that, when selected,
would navigate to a separate page to elicit additional feedback. She
reminded the committee that the surveys would be accompanied by a
document from the General Manager listing his evaluative performance
criteria, along with a self-assessment of his year-to-date accomplishments.
Director Menten said that in previous years the Directors did not see the
interaction between the survey and the General Manager’s self-evaluation
memo.
Committee Chair Walker added that the ability to expound on a given
answer was included as an option for each survey question, rather than as a
separate optional comments section at the end of the survey.

Packet Pg. 7

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 24, 2018 3:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Broom said there was not much point in Directors being on the
committee if they did not fill out the survey.

6.A

Ms. McManus reiterated that the survey was structured in the same format
as the core and task goals in the General Manager’s performance evaluation.
She said the format would allow Directors to gather information to formulate
their responses before the survey was issued.

Committee Chair Walker responded that subjectivity existed in any
evaluation.
Director Folska, Ph.D., answered that the General Manager’s voice was the
only one at the table with respect to his self-evaluation. She said selfevaluations carry an inherent bias and noted the General Manager’s report
did not include documentation from staff supporting or opposing his selfrating.
Director Menten asked for clarification on questions that were phrased as
asking how the respondent anticipated the General Manager would perform
on a given criterion as of the end-of-year evaluation.
Chair Tisdale clarified his interpretation of the survey question. He said the
question was whether the respondent felt, based on the person’s knowledge
at the time the survey was issued, that the General Manager would meet
expectations by the end of the year for a given review criterion. He said the
respondent would state whether they felt the General Manager would
improve, stay the same, or get worse. He added that, while the General
Manager may need to improve on a given area, based on current
observations, the Director could still rate his performance as meeting
expectations.
Director Menten said she would prefer to respond to questions based on her
thoughts at the time the survey was issued.
Committee Chair Walker likened the questions to the prospective quarterly
reports of a Fortune 500 company and said that respondents could state
that they anticipated things to be on track at the end of the year based on
current observations.

Packet Pg. 8

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 24, 2018 3:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Folska, Ph.D., said that she would have no knowledge of certain
actions taken by the General Manager. She said she would like better
documentation of the General Manager’s actions in order to render an
evaluation.

6.A

Director Folska, Ph.D., added that the Directors would know whether things
were on schedule based on milestones.

Director Mihalik stated that he was hung up on the wording of the
questions. He asked why the question was not phrased as an evaluation of
the General Manager’s performance at the mid-year point, and he said he did
not see the value in predicting how he would feel at the end of the year.
Ms. McManus said she might have misstated the intent of the question. She
said she let the expert, Mr. Yaklich, figure out how to ask the question.
Committee Chair Walker said that, at his other job, he reported quarterly to
his supervisor in order to track his goals for an end-of-year review. He said
he interpreted the question as asking what the Director knew at the time the
survey was released.
Director Mihalik said that the Directors responses would still answer that
question. He said that responses to certain review criteria would indicate
that the General Manager needed improvement at the mid-year point.
Chair Tisdale suggested that there might be questions contained in the
survey to ascertain both current and future assessments of the General
Manager’s performance, but he said he would review the draft survey
thoroughly. He agreed with Director Menten’s statement that she wanted to
assess the General Manager’s performance based on his then-current
performance.
Director Menten reiterated that she did not want to rate the General
Manager on his anticipated performance.
Committee Chair Walker suggested that the question regarding the agency’s
fiscal sustainability was specifically worded to assess the General Manager’s
anticipated performance at the end of the year.
Chair Tisdale suggested that the Directors should be asked both questions,
for both current and anticipated performance.

Packet Pg. 9

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 24, 2018 3:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Committee Chair Walker said that the retirements of senior staff or
legislative action could also create additional challenges that would affect
the responses.

6.A

Director Hoy asked whether the two surveys given during the calendar year
would be identical.

Director Hoy said that the Directors’ predictions of future performance in the
first survey were not as important as the actual results in the second survey.
He said that Directors could not know at the mid-year point what they would
think in the future.
Director Broom replied that the answers to the first survey would send a
signal to the General Manager that the Directors anticipate a problem.
Director Hoy said that Director Broom hit the nail on the head. He said the
point of the survey was not to find out what the Directors think at the time
but rather to give the General Manager feedback on what he would need to
do to meet expectations by the end of the year.
Committee Chair Walker asked whether Director Broom’s statement
answered the Director’s questions or whether they still wanted a “how do
you feel today” question.
Director Menten said she preferred to respond to the survey questions based
on her feelings at the time of the survey.
Committee Chair Walker asked whether it would be helpful to Director
Menten and others to add a question based on then-current performance.
Director Lubow said she felt that the survey was missing a component, one
that would assess whether the Board and the General Manager felt things
were working well within the agency. She said she did not know where such
a question would fit within the goals. She said that, by not asking the
question, the committee was not addressing the elephant in the room. She
added that the problems with rail lines in 2017 were a concern.
Committee Chair Walker asked whether Director Lubow was asking for a
general catch-all question.
Ms. McManus said she understood what Director Lubow was saying, but
she stated that the committee only could evaluate the General Manager in

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 24, 2018 3:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Ms. McManus said the surveys would be worded identically, though she
noted the first would measure the General Manager’s performance mid-year
and the second would measure cumulative year-to-date performance.

6.A

2018 on criteria approved by the committee in 2017. She said the questions
should fit with the categories of his performance review.

Director Folska, Ph.D., said that the challenge in evaluating the General
Manager was that some things that were out of his control. She suggested
that those elements that he could not control could be weighted differently
in his review and asked whether the committee had contemplated doing so
in the past.
Committee Chair Walker responded that no such weighting had been done in
his time on the committee.
Ms. McManus said that something similar had been done in the past.
Director Folska, Ph.D., added that the things beyond the General Manager’s
control could happen at the right time or the wrong time. She said certain
external events were important but not as important as things going on
within the district. She reiterated that parsing the General Manager’s direct
and indirect control over certain elements was a better way to evaluate his
performance.
Chair Tisdale stated that the Directors rule the forms, not the other way
around. He said the Directors had the right to consider the questions and
their responses, and he said that any survey that a monkey could score was
not one that properly served the agency and the General Manager. He said
the committee would review each question on the survey and encourage
Directors to add narrative information to their answers. Regarding Director
Lubow’s request to add a catch-all question about the state of RTD as a
whole, Chair Tisdale said that, in a well-crafted survey, that question is itself
answered by the sum of the responses to all other questions. He said each
question at its heart was supposed to ask whether things were working,
otherwise the questions should be revised. Regarding the desire to make
changes to the criteria on which the General Manager is reviewed, Chair
Tisdale noted that the committee would perform two functions in 2018: to
assess the General Manager’s current-year performance based on
parameters set in 2017 and to set the parameters for 2019. He said the
Packet Pg. 11

Director Lubow said Director Menten and she had spoken with General
Counsel Rolf Asphaug about changing review criteria. She said that the
terms were not written in stone and that there were options available in the
General Manager’s contract. She stated that it was essential to ask about
the state of the agency

6.A

parameters were not cast in stone, but he added that the committee
formally decided in 2017 the review criteria that would be used in 2018,
and he said the rules should not be changed in the middle of the game.

Committee Chair Walker agreed with Director Broom. He said some results
were outside of one’s control, but there were actions the person could take
as well. He said the actions taken to achieve a goal should count.
Director Hoy asked about mechanics of filling out the survey. He said in
previous years Directors were required to complete the survey within one
sitting and that it was not possible to save one’s work. He asked whether
that could be changed.
Ms. McManus said that she would check with Mr. Yaklich on that capability,
but she said she believed that would be a possibility because Directors
would receive individual survey links rather than one link for the entire
Board.
Director Menten asked whether the agency was required to pay for the use
of the survey program it used.
Ms. McManus said that the agency used the base model of the program and
would have to check on the payment structure.
Director Hoy suggested that the agency pay for the premium version if doing
so would grant access to the features that would allow Directors to save
their progress on the surveys.
Director Folska, Ph.D., stated that the committee’s conversation was useful
and should be shared with full Board in order to receive richer responses to
the survey questions.
Committee Chair Walker said the plan was to include the rest of the Board in
the committee’s discussions. He said the committee served two functions,
to create the metrics for performance for the following year and to evaluate
the General Manager’s performance. He said the Board met in March to
Packet Pg. 12

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 24, 2018 3:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Broom stated that it would be inaccurate to say that the recapture
of the $29 million credit risk premium from the refinancing of the Denver
Union Station project was out of the General Manager’s hands. He stated
that the General Manager’s efforts counted, adding that the General
Manager could direct lobbyists’ actions.

6.A

Director Lubow said that Committee Chair Walker was referring to the 2019
priorities and that the task goals could only be changed at the time of a
contract issuance or renewal.
Committee Chair Walker asked Director Lubow to clarify whether she was
referring to the core goals.
Director Lubow said that was correct.
Committee Chair Walker said that Director Lubow’s understanding of the
process was not incorrect, but he added that the core goals could be
changed. He said the goals were tied to the performance measures in the
General Manager’s contract.
Chair Tisdale said that he has begun the discussion of changing the
nomenclature used to discuss the General Manager’s performance review
process. He said that he drafted a glossary of terms, in which he would
define “core goals” as being key employee competencies, whereas “task
goals” would flow from and advance the strategic priorities selected by the
Board. He said task goals relate to things that could change from year to
year, while core goals would be things that were contractually established.
He said Committee Chair Walker was correct that core goals would not
change year over year because they were contractual. He said that the
committee would regularly look at task goals year over year, because the
agency’s priorities change.
Committee Chair Walker said he reviewed the General Manager’s core and
task goals and job description. He said that there was some overlap between
the core and task goals. He said the core goals could be changed and
suggested that any alteration might simply require wordsmithing. He said he
was not sure of elements could be changed entirely because they related to
specific sections of the job description.

Packet Pg. 13

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 24, 2018 3:30 PM (Committee Reports)

determine the agency’s strategic priorities for 2019. He said the difference
between terms “task goals and core goals” and “strategic priorities” could
be considered a matter of semantics, but he said there was more to it than
that. He said the committee and the General Manager would formalize the
goal-setting process on May 17th, the date on which the General Manager’s
tasks and strategic priorities would be set. He said that was the date that
the committee could interject and discuss how and whether to adjust the
metrics.

6.A

Ms. McManus said that the performance evaluation process was changed
agency-wide in 2018, though she said the process was not far from where it
was in years past. She said it was determined previously that the General
Manager’s review would follow the same process as other employees’
reviews. She noted that seven years prior senior management established
core goals for all agency employees to be evaluated against, and she added
that previous members of GM Oversight wanted to ensure that the General
Manager’s review process was the same as that for any other agency
employee. She added that structure was what dictated that the core goals
would not change.
Director Lubow said she was not comfortable with that restriction.
Ms. McManus said she was only giving the history of the process. She said
it would be a different scenario if another category were only added to the
General Manager’s core goals. She said people had made the statement that
the core goals could not be changed based on how the process was set up
and approved for the agency. She said she was unsure whether the same
process was in place for previous General Managers Cal Marsella.
General Manager Genova stated he did not think there was a performance
evaluation process for Mr. Marsella.
Ms. McManus said that, following the legislative audit, the performance
evaluation structure was changed to be more inclusive to entire agency.
Director Lubow observed that the General Manager’s core goals were related
to the General Manager’s specific duties, and she asked whether every
employee’s core goals are related to their positions.
General Manager Genova said that was correct. He said that the core goals
came about as a result of the legislative audit and were developed based on
the job description of the General Manager. He said there was considerable
effort to draft the goals and elicit the Board’s approval. He noted that the
Board felt that the core goals should remain relatively consistent, whereas
Packet Pg. 14

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 24, 2018 3:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Lubow said it was her impression that the core goals could be
changed. She said that in the past Directors had stated that the goals were
set in stone, which she said was not accurate, and she indicated the
evaluation process should be revisited. She said she was not sure of the
origin of the rating tiers of “needs improvement”, “achieved goal” and
“exceeds expectations”.

6.A

the task goals would reflect the changing priorities of the Board. He said the
process was similar for other employees, where the task goals are developed
between the manager and employee. He stated that the review pyramid
contained in the binder influenced the priorities of the entire organization,
meaning that the goals established in 2018 would flow down through the
agency in the form of specific employee tasks.

General Manager Genova said the changes would not necessarily affect
employees but said they could.
Ms. McManus added that, if the committee were to change what was
expected of the General Manager, the changes could affect everyone down
the chain.
Director Lubow said that it made sense to revisit the expectations
periodically and not to be hamstrung.
General Manager Genova responded that minor revisions to his goals had
been made over time. He cited the review element regarding his oversight
and monitoring of Denver Transit Partners (DTP) covers monitoring DTP
performance, which change he said was instituted the previous year.
Ms. McManus said that DTP monitoring was added as an element.
General Manager Genova said the change was made through GM Oversight.
He clarified that he had never heard the committee contemplate going back
to the General Manager’s contract to make changes to the core goals. He
said the intent was never to make major changes to the core goals but
rather to make tweaks as necessary over time. He said the committee felt it
appropriate to add the DTP monitoring item because it was a change
precipitated by changing times.
Committee Chair Walker added that the goal was not changed, only a review
element under the goal.
Ms. McManus stated that the review elements could change every year. She
noted that the percentage of key performance indicators necessary to
achieve the goal was increased the previous year.

E. Bi-Annual Board of Directors Survey
(See discussion above)

F. Questions and Next Steps

Ms. McManus said that the committee developed each of the review
elements under the core goal headings.
Committee Chair Walker noted that the committee’s proposed timeline of
events was contained in the second tab of the binder. He said he took it that
no changes were necessary because he heard no comments from the
committee members.
Ms. McManus said the timeline was formulated based on what had
happened the previous year. She said additional dates could be added or
meeting times could be changed if necessary.
Chair Tisdale said he wanted to make sure that Director Lubow was
comfortable with the scoring of the survey questions. He said the scoring
methodology was set by the Board in 2010 but could be changed by a
subsequent Board action. He added that the core goals remained generally
consistent and the task goals were established collaboratively between the
Board and the General Manager.
Committee Chair Walker explained that the General Manager would return to
the committee with his tactical plans, which the committee would review
and request ay necessary changes. He said that the General Manager had
the opportunity to explain how and why those changes could be difficult to
implement.
Ms. McManus stated that she had worked with Committee Chair Walker in
setting an earlier than usual date for the first meeting of the GM Oversight
committee, which would allow the committee to begin to think about the
review process at the same time General Manager Genova presented his
tactical plan at the April study session.

Committee Chair Walker said that the General Manager would present his
task goals to the committee at a future meeting. He said the committee
would discuss whether the General Manager’s goals and the committees’
aligned and would modify elements accordingly.

6.A

General Manager Genova added that he would receive feedback from the
Board based upon his presentation that would take place later that day. He
said he would return to the committee to propose his core and task goals for
2019.

Director Menten said the changes could be proposed on May 17th.
Committee Chair Walker said there was an opportunity to address potential
changes earlier than that date as well.
Director Menten said she would try to distribute by the following week a
modified version of one of the previous year’s review documents. She asked
whether the committee agenda item regarding the approved policies had
been acted upon.
Ms. McManus said that the policy documents were included in the packet
for the committee’s review. She added that the materials were initially
approved following the legislative audit and were included to familiarize the
committee members with the historical governing documents.
Chair Tisdale added that those documents had previously been approved by
the Board and, absent any changes, would govern the conduct of the
committee going forward.
Director Menten asked whether the documents could be addressed, and she
asked which state statutory provisions governed the General Manager’s
review.
General Manager Genova stated that the impetus for the review came from a
legislative audit rather than from a statutory mandate
Chair Tisdale said the committee had the opportunity to make sure that
Directors’ questions and concerns were heard. He said that the issues could
be put on the table, and the committee could determine whether the issues
that were identified had been addressed or could be addressed in the future.

Director Lubow said she was aware that Director Menten wanted the
performance evaluation criteria to change, and she asked when that would
happen.

6.A

Director Mihalik said he hoped the Board would entertain the idea of
separating the General Manager’s discretionary performance payout from his
overall evaluation.
Ms. McManus said that was the plan for 2018.

General Manager Genova when he would need to provide his proposed
formalized goals in written form.
Ms. McManus said that the document would need to be delivered by
Thursday, May 10th in order to be included in the packet for the May 17th
meeting.
General Manager Genova pointed out that the performance survey would be
distributed on June 4th, but he noted that his mid-year self-assessment
document was not due until June 20th. He asked whether the Directors
needed his self-assessment before they would be able to complete their
surveys.
Ms. McManus said that the survey turnaround dates were loose but the
General Manager’s due date for his document was not.
Committee Chair Walker said that GM Oversight was an important
committee. He said he was nervous about being the chair of the committee
but hoped that he would earn the committee members’ support. He said that
he would be reaching out to committee members soon and that he was open
for dialogue.

Discussion:

Rolf Asphaug, General Counsel, stated that the Colorado
General Assembly had passed a law in February that fixed a
mistake which had inadvertently halted the collection of
marijuana tax revenues by RTD the Scientific and Cultural
Facilities District (SCFD) and a number of other entities. The
new law, passed in February, allowed for marijuana tax
revenues to again flow to RTD provided that the Board
certified to the Colorado Department of Revenue that no
further vote of the electorate was required by the Colorado
constitution and under applicable case law by the Colorado
Supreme Court and Colorado Court of Appeals to do so. He
indicated that the certification requirement came about as a
result of a pending Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TABOR) case
which involved RTD and SCFD being undecided at the
Supreme Court at the time that the general assembly passed
the new bill in February. That case involved a statute which
was passed in 2013 and RTD and SCFD won that case, and
relevant statements were made in the case opinion which
were helpful in deciding this issue. He noted that staff had
recently provided the Board with copies of the legal opinion
analyzing whether the legal authorities required a vote and,
now that the Supreme Court case had been decided in RTD’s
favor, his opinion was that no further vote was required to
resume collection of the marijuana tax under TABOR, other
provisions under the Colorado constitution, or other case law.
He stated that he had drafted a recommended resolution
containing the necessary certifications so that RTD could again
collect marijuana tax revenue. He noted that the SCFD had
already undergone the same exercise as the Board and had
already issued their certification to the Colorado Department of
Revenue. He added that there was some urgency, and if
RTD’s certification was not submitted by May 17th, both RTD
and the SCFD would not be able to collect marijuana tax
revenue until the following January. He commented that, if the
certification were submitted before May 17th, RTD could begin
to collect marijuana tax revenue beginning July 1st. He further
added that the new Supreme Court opinion had language
supporting the concept of being able to resume collection of a
previously voter authorized tax in a situation like this, when

Packet Pg. 23

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 15, 2018 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Deadwyler seconded the motion.

6.C

Director Menten said that she provided each Director with an
original promotional flyer produced by RTD in an effort to sell
the FasTracks program to the voters. She noted that she had
highlighted one portion of the flyer, which indicated that sales
tax would not apply to groceries. She said that with the sales
tax parity, otherwise referred to as the dirty dozen bills, there
was a sales tax on certain groceries and asked if RTD was
collecting sales tax on groceries.
Mr. Asphaug stated that, if Director Menten was referring to
the bill from 2013, it was sustained as constitutional by the
Colorado Supreme Court.
Director Folska, Ph.D., commented that Director Menten’s
remarks were off topic and asked to either call the question or
get back on topic.
Chair Tisdale asked Director Menten to be more concise with
her question.
Director Menten remarked that RTD staff waited to bring
forward the marijuana reinstatement of a retired tax because
of the Supreme Court ruling for the tax of some grocery
products and added that she would like to continue with this
discussion as she thought it was appropriate.
Chair Tisdale said that the Supreme Court needed to rule their
decision before RTD could move forward because RTD needed
to know if the action that needed to be taken was in
compliance with the Supreme Court decision.
Director Menten commented that the Board owed it to the tax
payers to have the discussion. She noted that one bill was
referred to as the pop and candy act. She said that if a food
product was qualified as junk food it would be taxed, and to

Packet Pg. 24

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 15, 2018 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

the legislature made a mistake which caused the collection of
an existing voter-approved tax to be inadvertently interrupted.
He reiterated that this was not a new tax, or a tax policy
change under TABOR, but an effort to fix a mistake so that an
existing voter-approved tax could be properly collected.

6.C

Director Mihalik noted that he too took issue with the opinion
and how it diluted the meaning and intent of TABOR and
added that this would set a dangerous precedent for future
TABOR opinions.
Director Folska, Ph.D., said that it was clear to her that this
was something that the voters approved, and, only because of
an error by the Colorado legislature was the reason for RTD’s
discussion. She added that RTD was not issuing the tax, the
state was.
Chair Tisdale remarked that the legislature did admit it was a
mistake on their part and it needed to be remedied.
Director Lubow said that she would be voting in favor of this
item. She added that, while she appreciated the opinions of
those opposed, the standard of reasonableness was something
that the courts had the right to consider.
Director Catlin noted that she shared some of the same
concerns with the ruling as Director Mihalik. However, she
noted that she would rather RTD have the ability to control
that tax than to have it put into the black hole of government
spending.
Director Hoy said that there should be a distinction between
groceries and marijuana. He noted that the Supreme Court
dealt with the grocery issue, and they may have watered
down TABOR, but the issue this evening was whether RTD
should collect marijuana taxes as it did in the past. He added

Packet Pg. 25

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 15, 2018 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

her, it was immoral to tax food. She added that the Fiscal
Sustainability Task Force was created to increase sales tax
and the numbers mentioned in their documents indicated that
it would raise sales tax revenue by $3 to $12 million. She
added that TABOR was very clear that tax policy changes are
supposed to go to the taxpayers. She further added that she
strongly disagreed with the policy actions and, that if the
marijuana tax resolution passed, she could not trust
government.

6.C

that the tax went away by mistake and the Board should
acknowledge that and move forward.

Director Menten asked if she could submit a minority report. She wanted to make it
clear that she was not a unanimous vote.
Chair Tisdale stated that the official record would show that she was a no vote.

B. Recommended Actions

• Increase Fixed-Route Contract Authority and Budget Transfer due to
Operator Wage Increases

Transit “Group 24” (contract #14-DH-003); Transdev “Group 25” (contract
#14-DH-021); First Transit “Group 26” (contract #15-DH-064); and First
Transit “Group 27” (contract #16-DH-055); to cover increased costs
incurred due to proposed operator wage increases over the term of the

 Group 24 – add up to $2,327,316.00 to increase the contract authority
on contract #14-DH-003 from $130,465,884.00, as approved by the
Board of Directors on March 18, 2014, to a revised contract authority of
$132,793,200.00.
 Group 25 – add up to $2,432,022.00 to increase the contract authority

6.D

6.D

Board of Directors on April 25, 2017, to a revised contract authority of
$148,679,846.00.

It is further recommended by the Operations and Customer Service
Committee that the Board of Directors authorize budget transfers in a total
amount not to exceed $4,998,797.00 from the 2018 Board-appropriated
reserve to the following fixed-route service contracts to cover the increased
costs incurred due to proposed private contractor operator wage increases
for 2018:
 Group 24 (contract #14-DH-003) - $1,508,841.00
 Group 25 (contract #14-DH-021) - $1,042,295.00
 Group 26 (contract #15-DH-064) - $878,518.00
 Group 27 (contract #16-DH-055) - $1,569,143.00
This action supports Core Goal #1, Successful Delivery of Transit Services;
Task Goal #1, Fiscal Sustainability; and Task Goal #2, Workforce and
Human Capital.
Motion:

Director Anderson made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the May 22, 2018
Board Meeting.
Director Solano seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Michael Ford, Chief Operations Officer, noted that this had
been brought up as an informational item at the committee
meeting the previous month. He said that this action item
would help stabilize the contractor workforce as there were
concerns with the new Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA)
that had been adopted. He added that this action item would
help keep some parity with RTD’s private sector contractors.
Carolyn Conover, Senior Manager of Contracted Services,
noted that all of the information was included in the Board
Report. She added that staff had conversations with its private
contractors since the new CBA went into effect, and 125 out
of 840 contractor operators had approached them with
concerns about the disparity in operator wages. Staff is
concerned that by not allowing the contactors to increase their
wages there might be some cannibalization of the contractor
operators as they move to work directly for RTD.

Packet Pg. 29

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 15, 2018 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

The total increase in contract authority is up to $14,387,479.00 over the
next four (4) years while these services are rebid.

6.D

Director Broom asked if RTD’s existing contracted services
contracts had escalator clauses to deal with issues like this.
Ms. Conover stated that they did not.

Director Folska, Ph.D., echoed Director Broom’s comments
and said that it should not be a surprise to staff that
negotiations with Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU) 1001
would occur every three years and the outcome of that
negotiation would affect contractor agreements as well. She
then inquired as to how much RTD’s contractors pay for the
buses that they get from RTD.
Ms. Conover stated that RTD did not charge contractors for
the use of RTD buses.
Director Folska, Ph.D., asked why the contractors did not
provide the increase on their own without RTD interference.
Ms. Conover explained that the new wages amounted to a
large increase. She noted that RTD’s starting operator wage
was $19.40 and the contractor’s starting wage was only
$17.50, so it was a big difference.
Director Folska, Ph.D., inquired as to what the range was for
the contractor agreements.
Ms. Conover explained that each contract was between three
to five years and they were all staggered. She noted that staff
was looking at accelerating the re-bid process for the next
contract so that they were quicker.
Mr. Ford noted that the increase would not be applied to the
contractor’s profit margin, but would be applied to the basic
wages and selected supervision of the contractor operators.
Director Folska, Ph.D., stated that this was about the
contractors maintaining their current profit margin and passing
on their costs to RTD.
Director Anderson said that if RTD gave their drivers increased

contracted operators would eventually move over to RTD for
jobs. She said that those in the suburbs who were served by
contracted services such as First Transit for bus service would
not have enough operators to maintain service, therefore she
would be supporting this.

Ms. Conover stated that it would be up to the contractors to
negotiate what their starting wage would be and the
progression for the rest of their employees. She noted that
$18.00 to $18.50 would be the target pay range.
Director Lubow asked if that meant that RTD did not know
what would be spent.
Ms. Conover explained that the total amount could be less
than anticipated, but it would not be more than what the
Board had authorized.

C. Updates

• University of Colorado A Line Service Interruption on April 20, 2018
Presentation
Mr. Ford stated that since the April 20th event RTD has been working with
its contractor to improve service moving forward and to rectify certain
issues.
John Thompson, Denver Transit Partners (DTP), stated that everyone at DTP
was investing in RTD and the metro area, and no one more so than Anne
Herzenberg, General Manager of Denver Transit Operators (DTO).
Ms. Herzenberg thanked the Board for the opportunity to explain the April
20th event. She noted that her presentation would cover:
 Causes and Effects of Service Disruption
 Efforts to Rescue Disabled Trains

Communication with Patrons During Event
Plans to Prevent a Recurrence
Improving Response to Abnormal Conditions
Improving Communication to Patrons

Ms. Herzenberg said that the timeline of the event was:
 3:57pm: Train 4045/46 departed DIA in service
 4:03pm: Train 4045/46 reported a power problem at MP 18.41 (5
miles south of DIA in the single track area)
 Operations Control Center (OCC) attempted to advise train operator
on how to overcome a vehicle related propulsion fault
 4:13pm: Train 4017/18 departed DIA with passengers – OCC
instructs operator to couple to the disabled train ahead and push to
61st and Pena Station
 4:18pm: Train 4017/18 reports train disabled – “will not take power”
 4:19pm: Two disabled trains are stranded with passengers on-board
– a major service disruption began to unfold
Ms. Herzenberg remarked that the problems were caused by:
 The OCC assumed the initial power problem on train 4045/46 was
due to a train-related fault
 The Traction Power System (overhead catenary system) did not
experience any faults and indicated a normal state at the OCC
 The overhead wires were intact and the traction power system
remained energized, however a piece of the hardware assembly
supporting the OCS had failed
 The “steady arm” component of the cantilever beam supporting the
OCS fractured
 The free swinging steady arm made contact with the passing trains
and broke the shear pins supporting the trains’ pantographs causing
the trains to lose contact with the overhead wire and lose power
Ms. Herzenberg stated that the recovery effort for train 4045/46, the first
disabled train was:
 4:03pm: Train 4045/46 was disabled with passengers on board
 4:42pm: OCC requested a bus bridge
 4:42pm: a third train was off loaded at 61st and Pena Station and
sent to rescue the train 4045/46 from the south
 Multiple efforts to couple to train 4045/46 were unsuccessful due to
weather conditions and a steep grade
 6:54pm: successful couple, southbound tow in progress
 7:13pm: passengers on train are unloaded at 61st and Pena
 Total time passengers were on disabled train = 190 minutes

Ms. Herzenberg commented that RTD’s concerns and criticism about its
communications with customers and RTD was well founded. Furthermore:
 Communications directly with passengers on the failed trains, with
other passengers on the line, and with RTD was disjointed, unreliable,
and inaccurate at times
 Despite considerable efforts by DTO staff:
o Communication Systems were not used effectively
o Efforts were confused with results (many messages were
made – but often proved unreliable due to the lack of specifics
or changing circumstances)
o Our passengers were just not well informed – neither was RTD
Ms. Herzenburg said that the events lead to a major disruption because:
 During initial stages, the OCC failed to accurately assess the cause
and magnitude of the problem
 Attempts to couple the first disabled train were complicated by
extreme weather conditions and a steep grade
 Severe weather affected decisions that may have led to evacuating
passengers on to the right-of-way
 Trains were stranded at least 4 miles from the closest station
 Inexperience - DTO personnel have not encountered this type of
incident before
Ms. Herzenberg remarked that lessons learned for DTO operations included:
 Treating all disabled trains between stations as a potential emergency
– understanding the potential for a prolonged event
 Operational tactics need review – focus on taking care of the
passengers first – moving the train is secondary
 Limit the time passengers are stranded before evacuation is ordered.
FRA and RTD view evacuation to the ground as a last option.
 Review SOPs and the EPREP – plug gaps
 Training for operations personnel needs to be re-examined especially
procedures and preparation for dealing with abnormal circumstances

OCC communication systems were not used effectively
Customers received inconsistent and unreliable information
The OCC was slow to realize the magnitude of the problems and, as
a result, important information flow was compromised
Reliable descriptions of the service impacts were not conveyed to
RTD via the ReadyOps Notification system
DTO did not supplement the OCC with additional customer service
staff until well into the emergency
On-board and station announcements were not used effectively
Quality matters not just quantity
During emergencies, staff the OCC with additional communications

Utilize existing systems and technology better
o The OCC could have communicated directly with passengers
on-board the disabled trains – it did not
o ReadyOps messaging was too generic – notifications require
specifics
o Station public address and variable messaging systems were
underutilized
Review reliance on ReadyOps notification system
Automated communications were not enough

Ms. Herzenberg said that plans to prevent recurrence included:
 Evaluating failure analysis of fractured bracket
 Improving DTO Operational Responses
 Improving Communication with RTDC Customers
 Improving Communication with RTD Management and Staff
 Continuously test operational readiness
 Consider all the input from the after-action review – apply lessons
learned
 Augment training program (June 30)
o Incorporating quarterly table-top drills into existing operations
staff training program
o Underscore emphasis on tactical decision making during
abnormal circumstances
o Emphasis on rigor of communication protocols at all levels –
within the OCC, on trains, in stations, RTD notifications, Rider
Alerts, etc.
o Hands-on equipment training for field supervisors (interim
completion of May 31, repeat quarterly)
 Revising DTO Operations SOPs – Completed

Ms. Herzenberg remarked that in summary:
 Operational readiness will be improved
 Communications with RTD will improve
 And improving communications with our customers is our highest
priority

Committee Chair Deadwyler thanked Ms. Herzenberg for her update and
DTO’s plans to improve service in the future. She added that people realize
that there will be some type of breakdown, but they do not understand
being held hostage while staff tries to figure out what the problem was. She
added that this incident was in her district and constituents were calling her
trying to figure out what was causing the delay. She further added that RTD
and DTO need to get people off stranded trains, no matter how long the
delay.
Director Williams asked if a big part of the issue was the location of the
stalled trains.
Ms. Herzenberg said yes. She noted that both trains were four miles from
the nearest station, and the closest gate in the fence was far off. She added
that both RTD and the FRA have said that evacuating passengers to the
ground was the last resort. She noted that in hindsight DTO should not have
attempted to couple the trains and the rescue train should have been
brought in from the beginning. She added that DTO would examine the
location and position where the trains broke down again.
Director Archuleta commented that the entire presentation seemed like a
fancy way of saying if it breaks, it will be fixed. He added that train tickets
should have a disclaimer indicating that passengers ride at their own risk.
Mr. Ford stated that RTD took this matter very seriously. He remarked that
RTD was meeting with DTO and staff to provide the best customer service,
and added that RTD did not want to have a system that people were
hesitant to use. He added that he was on one of the trains, so he had
firsthand knowledge of what happened that day. He stated that RTD was
providing more oversight and recommendations to DTO to train them for
how to correctly respond to these type of incidents.
Director Anderson commented that, while people were uncomfortable,
luckily no one was hurt. She noted that when trains couple it is a very
Packet Pg. 35

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 15, 2018 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Ms. Herzenberg added that in the future DTO would treat every train issue
as a full scale emergency. She commented that DTO will need to examine
the situation and be very careful about their response before taking any
action. She stated that DTO needed to improve all aspects of its
communication as well as continue to improve its operational readiness.

6.D

dangerous maneuver, and she was happy to know that no one was injured
in the process.
Director Broom asked if DTO could use tugs similar to those used by
airplanes to move disabled trains to the nearest station. He noted that, if
there was a power issue, it would need to be diesel or battery powered, but
it was something RTD and DTO should look into.

General Manager Genova commented that RTD owned a Nordco Mobile
Railcar Mover but it was only for use on light rail tracks. He said that RTD
had recently replaced its outdated Mercedes-Benz Unimog in 2016, but the
Nordco could not be used on the commuter rail tracks because it was not
FRA compliant.
Director Folska, Ph.D., agreed with Director Anderson that safety was RTD’s
number one priority, but she said that the situation that occurred on April
20th was not acceptable. She stated that, when trains break down,
passengers need to be removed from the stranded trains and bus bridges
need to be implemented as soon as possible.
Ms. Herzenberg noted that DTO had tried to find a suitable rescue train for
the past two years but they had still been unable to find one.
Director Folska, Ph.D., suggested that if DTO could not find the right rescue
train they should invent one. She noted that other train companies could
potentially need the same design too. She added that DTO should
incorporate the Japanese way of thinking of “Look, See, Say”.
Director Sisk stated that both RTD and DTO had glossed over the 230
passengers that were inconvenienced and that was part of the public
relations effort that was lacking. He said that both agencies failed its
constituents and left them stranded on two trains for hours without any
explanation and that was unacceptable. He added that a situation like that
could not happen again and both agencies need to reach out to the
inconvenienced passengers to make it right.
Chair Tisdale commented that DTO came to fall on their sword, as it was
appropriate. He noted that it did not fix the problem, but DTO was taking
the necessary steps to address their failure. He remarked that the biggest
part of the failure was the lack of communication to the individuals stuck on
the two trains and added that it was compelling for him to find out that
RTD’s own COO was on one of those trains, and the only way he was able
to find out any information was because he called internally to RTD staff.

Director Folska, Ph.D., said that RTD already owned something like that.

6.D

Director Lubow remarked that what happened was very disappointing. She
asked if DTO intended to have more emergency planning exercises.
Ms. Herzenberg said yes, and added that quarterly table top exercises would
reinforce that as well.

Ms. Herzenberg stated that table top exercises put staff on the spot. She
explained that staff would be asked how they would handle a certain
emergency and their responses would then be compared against the
Standard Operating Procedures (SOP). She noted that table top exercises
would be recorded so staff could see what ideas were beneficial, and which
ideas did not conform to the SOP.
Director Lubow asked what the difference was between table top exercises
and drills.
Ms. Herzenberg remarked that drills were acted out in the field and noted
that DTO had recently performed a drill on the G Line in Arvada.
Director Lubow inquired if DTO would schedule drills regularly.
Mr. Ford said yes, and he noted that was something that RTD was asking
DTO to do since they are critically important.
Director Lubow noted that coupling exercises in steep grades should be at
the top of DTO’s training and exercise list as well.
Director Menten asked if the broken bracket that was shown in the
presentation was aluminum.
Ms. Herzenberg stated that it was cast-aluminum.
Director Menten inquired as to how many cast-aluminum brackets existed on
the University of Colorado A Line.
Mr. Herzenberg said there were hundreds.
Director Menten asked if the bracket was a typical design, or if it was a
custom made piece.
Ms. Herzenberg remarked that the design was used by a lot of agencies, but
the investigation into the cause of the failure was still underway.

Director Lubow inquired as to what exactly a table top exercise entailed.

6.D

Dave Jensen, Assistant General Manager of Rail Operations, said that RTD’s
requirement was that DTO performed adequate preventative maintenance.
He said that staff understood components would fail from time to time, but
those failures should be caught before a critical situation occurred.

Director Williams commented that there were trains that break all over the
country. She added that recently her staff was in Washington D.C. and their
train broke down, had to be towed, and they were stuck on the train for 90
minutes. She remarked that this was a learning experience and if RTD and
DTO move and improve on the lessons learned, service would improve.
Director Walker said that, to his recollection, there have been three well
known failures for the University of Colorado A Line. He noted that most of
the failures had occurred near the bridge heading towards Denver
International Airport (DIA) and asked if there was something significant
about that area.
Ms. Herzenberg said that the area around DIA was subject to lightning, more
so than other places.
Director Walker stated that the lack of communication was unacceptable
and he hoped that some of the steps being addressed were also transferable
to the G Line and the light rail system.
Director Hoy remarked that he agreed with a majority of the comments
made, but he was concerned with the part of the process that failed. He
noted that DTO’s investigation should consider if the broken component was
the right piece for the system and location. He added that he was
disappointed that RTD’s reputation was tarnished with this incident and it
hurt when something like this happened and hoped that DTP shared in that
pain. He asked if there was a cost associated with the problem to DTO,
such as reimbursing RTD for bus bridges.
Ms. Herzenberg said yes, DTO reimbursed RTD for bus bridges on the
commuter rail.
Director Solano asked how often DTO performed quality control testing and
inspection of components.
Ms. Herzenberg said that DTO’s maintenance program was based on
preventative maintenance and thar the line was checked every night. She
said other checks were performed at different levels of frequency.
Packet Pg. 38

Ms. Herzenberg added that DTO had an extensive preventative maintenance
program, and some work was completed during the day as well as at night.

Director Lubow urged Ms. Herzenberg and Mr. Thompson to come back in a
few months to provide the Board with another presentation that outlined
what changes had been made and implemented.

Mr. Ford noted that RTD continued to provide a steady level of service at
98.7%, but the agency was still having issues with driver retention and
operators working 6 days. He added that RTD continuined to have
challenges with bus bridges and fulfilling needs for other special events that
impacted operations. He noted that staff was monitoring and working on
operator retention and recruitment efforts and staff was increasing activity
on those fronts.

B. Recommended Actions

• 2017 CAFR and Report to Governance
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors accept and enter into the record the District’s audited
financial reports relating to the year ended December 31, 2017 as prepared
by staff and audited by RTD's independent auditor, RubinBrown, LLP.
GM CORE AND TASK GOALS MET
Core Goal #3: Strong Financial Management
Task Goal #1: Fiscal Sustainability
Motion:

Director Solano made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the May 22, 2018
Board Meeting.
Director Williams seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Heather McKillop, Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and Assistant
General Manager of Finance and Administration, introduced
Cheryl Wallace from the auditing firm of RubinBrown, LLP
(RubinBrown).
Ms. Wallace highlighted the results of the financial statement
and single audit from December 31, 2017, from the
ViewPoints presentation included in the Board packet which
contained the communication that every auditor is required to
Packet Pg. 41

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 15, 2018 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

6.E

Ms. Wallace explained that RubinBrown provided the following
services:
 Financial statement audits for the year ended December
31, 2017
 Single audit for the year ended December 31, 2017
 National Transit Database Federal Funding Allocation
Statistics Agreed-Upon Procedures Engagement for the
year ended December 31, 2017
 Report on Cost of General Manager’s Contract
She highlighted the objectives of a financial statement audit:
 Report to those charged with governance
o RTD Board of Directors
 Provide an opinion on whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement
 Obtain an understanding of the entity’s internal controls
 Audit procedures include:
o Review risks impacting the financial reporting
process
o Perform inquiries and analytical procedures
o Verify and substantiate selected account
balances or a sample of certain
o transactions
o Update our understanding of IT security risks
Ms. Wallace noted that the required auditor communication
began on page 9 of the presentation and she explained that
the left side of the report outlined the auditing standards and
the right side was the response from RubinBrown. She stated
that the audit was performed following governmental auditing
standards. Ms. Wallace explained that RubinBrown had issued
an unmodified opinion that was previously called an
unqualified opinion or a clean opinion. She noted that
RubinBrown planned and scoped the audit through an
engagement letter dated October 16, 2017. Ms. Wallace
explained that RubinBrown was responsible to report to the
governing body any changes in accounting practices and their
application and summarized the following findings:

Packet Pg. 42

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 15, 2018 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

provide to a governing body. She stated that RTD had retained
RubinBrown to perform a single audit and a financial
statements audit because RTD had received federal awards
over $750,000, and that RTD had also engaged RubinBrown
to issue an opinion on RTD’s federal awards.

No new accounting policies were adopted, and the
application of existing policies was not changed.
We noted no transactions entered into during the year
for which there was a lack of authoritative guidance or
consensus, with the exception of the P3, which the
Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) had
yet to address.
No significant transactions have been recognized in a
different period than when the transactions occurred.

Ms. Wallace explained that RubinBrown evaluated the key
factors and assumptions used to develop the estimates in
determining that they were reasonable in relation to the
financial statements taken as a whole. She identified the most
sensitive estimates affecting the financial statements as:
 Management’s estimate of depreciation is based upon
estimated useful lives of capital assets.
 Management’s estimate of the allowance for bad debts
is based on management’s review of outstanding
receivables.
 Management’s estimate of the net pension liability is
based on actuarial valuations and employee census
data.
Ms. Wallace stated that RTD had several financial disclosures
that were particularly sensitive because of their significance to
financial statement. However, she said the disclosures were
neutral, consistent and clear. She explained the most sensitive
disclosures affecting the financial statements were:
 The disclosure of investments in Note B
 The disclosure of capital assets in Note D
 The disclosure of long-term debt in Note E
 The disclosure of employee retirement and unearned
compensation plans in Note F
 The disclosure of commitments and contingencies in
Note H
 The disclosure of the tax, spending and debt limitations
in Note K
Ms. Wallace explained that the RTD finance team prepared the
document and that there were no difficulties encountered in
dealing with the management related to the performance of
the audit. She detailed the following audit adjustments that
were proposed as a result of the audit:



Interest expense was adjusted for prepaid TABOR
Secured Interest in the amount $40,953,636. This
adjustment increased the change in net position by the
same amount.

Ms. Wallace stated that RubinBrown had one recommendation
regarding the Public Private Partnership (P3) arrangement. She
explained that impacts to financial reporting were not
consistently evaluated throughout the project to consider the
changes and that the project was nearing full completion with
several amendments and anticipated amendments to contract
provisions. She said RubinBrown recommended that
management perform a comprehensive review of the key
clauses of the P3 agreement, which included but were not
limited to, completion of project, termination clauses and
changes in service, any potential accounting, budgetary and
financial reporting impacts. Further the suggested a review at
least annually with a key member of the financial management
team related to the impacted areas.
Ms. Wallace stated that the Governmental Accounting
Standards Board (GASB) had been very active implementing
future financial disclosures and that RTD would need to report
on the following:
 GASB Statement No. 75, Accounting and Financial
Reporting for Postemployment Benefits Other Than
Pensions
o Effective for 2018 RTD year end
o Similar effect to GASB 68 for other
postemployement benefits (health and welfare
plans), i.e., ATU Division 1001 Health and
Welfare Trust. RTD would be required to report
the benefit plan’s projected liability.
 GASB Statement No. 87, Leases
o Effective for 2019 year end
o Established a single model for lease accounting
based on the principle that leases were
financings of the right to use an underlying asset
o Application of this standard would go beyond
the previous guidance related to the recording of

Ms. Wallace stated that professional standards required her
firm to accumulate all misstatements identified during the
audit, other than those that were trivial, and communicate
them to the appropriate level of management but she said
there were no uncorrected misstatements in the RTD report.

leased assets. The standard would require
additional leased items on the books be recorded
as intangible right-to-use assets and related
liabilities.

Ms. McKillop explained that the FFGA had been withheld
because the G Line had not opened and that, as soon as the G
Line opened, the funds would be released. She added that the
funds from the FFGA were not an accounting issue and that
the money had been appropriated but could not be withdrawn.
Ms. McKillop stated the RubinBrown recommendations
regarding the P3 project were regarding what to classify as
reimbursable and set accounting standards of the funds for the
future.
Director Broom asked how pension reporting had changed in
the last few years.
Ms. Wallace explained that the GASB found significant
differences
in
pension
reporting
between
for-profit
corporations and governments. She stated that in the past, if
the actuary stated that payments had been made, then there
was no issue, and in 2008 some pension plans lost retirement
funds and that brought about the new requirements for
government pension reporting. Ms. Wallace explained that
government appropriate budgets yearly and the pension
reporting needed to include what the total benefits payments

• Budget Transfer for Commuter Rail Third Party Services
It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee
that the RTD Board of Directors approve a budget transfer of $2.82
million from the FasTracks Management Reserve to the commuter rail
operations budget for third party reimbursable projects to allow RTD to
compensate Denver Transit Partners (DTP) for costs it will incur for work
associated with third party agreements. The FasTracks Management
Reserve will be replenished in the 2018 Amended Budget with the funds
that will be received from third parties to compensate RTD for the
impacts to its operation.
This action addresses two of the General Manager’s goals for 2018:
Core Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services, and Task Goal #1
– Fiscal Sustainability.
Motion:

Director Anderson made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the May 22, 2018
Board Meeting.
Director Solano seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Ms. McKillop stated that RTD had worked with third party
partners, including stakeholders, local governments, and
private entities, on betterments that have included
enhancements to RTD rail lines and facilities beyond the
original construction plans and concurrent construction of

associated facilities for third parties. She explained that the
third parties requesting the work would reimburse RTD for all
costs associated with these betterments, so these betterments
were done at no net cost to RTD, and that RTD must pay DTP
for its costs related to these improvements.

Susan Cohen, Senior Manager of Finance stated that the two
largest projects are for the City and County of Denver (CCD)
road related projects such as the Central Park Road widening
and the Wewatta viaduct structure.
Director Folska, Ph.D., asked why CCD was not doing their
own projects.
Ms. Cohen explained that if CCD performed the work they
would impact RTD rail and have to coordinate with RTD
projects in order to perform any work. She stated that RTD
may see service impacts from third party construction projects
that require access to the right-of-way. She explained the
project varied from utilities that pass under the track, or
construction on bridges over the track and that in these
instances, DTP may be required to provide access to the track,
or to modify service, to allow the third party construction.
Director Folska, Ph.D., asked how long it would take for CCD
to reimburse RTD for the city’s projects.
Ms. McKillop stated that CCD pays within thirty to sixty days
of invoicing.
Director Hoy asked for clarification between the FasTracks
Management Reserve and what Ms. McKillop stated was the
Board Reserve.
Ms. McKillop stated that it was one and the same and
explained that the FasTracks Management Reserve was a
reserve that the Board set aside out of the base system, but in
order to draw money from that reserve, it must be Board
approved.

C. Updates

• Salaried Trust Actuarial Report
Ms. McKillop introduced Wendy Londa from Rael and Letson to provide the
update on the salaried employees’ pension plan fund status.
Ms. Londa reminded the Board that the Salaried Employees’ Pension Plan
was reviewed each year by an actuarial for a fund status report.
Ms. Londa reviewed the following information from the presentation that
was included in the Board packet:
Valuation Highlights as of January 1, 2017
 Total participant count decreased by 12 (from 687 to 675)
 Plan closed to new participants on January 1, 2008
 Active population decreased from 327 to 291
 Actuarial Accrued Liability increased by $7.6M (from $157.8M to
$165.4M)
 Actuarial Value of Assets increased by $8.3M (from $123.6M to
$131.9M)
 Unfunded Actuarial Accrued Liability decreased by $0.7M (from
$34.2M to $33.5M)
 Funded ratio based on the Actuarial Value of Assets increased from
78.3% to 79.7%
 Funded ratio based on the Market Value of Assets increased from
77.8% to 79.2%
 Recommended contribution decreased by $0.3M from $7.6M to
$7.3M

Trust “actuarially sound” based on the recommendations of the
Actuary and RTD’s Chief Financial Officer to contributing.
Last year, based on January 1, 2016 actuarial valuation results and
an estimated 2016 net investment return of 9.4%, the Plan was
projected to reach 100% funding in 2043 with a $4.6M contribution
each year if all assumptions were met in the future.
What has changed since last year?
 The actual net investment return for 2016 was 9.3% based on
the 12/31/2016 Plan audit.
 The Plan experienced a $2.3M salary gain in 2016 (2.5%
average salary increase for continuing actives compared to an
expected weighted average increase of 5.0%).
Reflecting January 1, 2017 valuation results, the Plan is projected to
reach 100% funding in 2042 (1 year earlier) with a $4.6M
contribution each year if all actuarial assumptions were met in the
future, including a net investment return of 7.5% per year beginning
in 2017.
What happened since the final January 1, 2017 valuation results
were issued?
 The Board approved a $5.1M contribution for the 2018 Fiscal
Year; the actuary’s recommended contribution was $7.3M.
 The investment return in 2017 exceeded the 7.50%
assumption – the preliminary 2017 net return is 14.2%.
Reflecting January 1, 2017 valuation results, a $5.1M contribution in
2018, and a 14.2% preliminary net return on assets in 2017, if all
actuarial assumptions were met each year, including a net investment
return of 7.5% per year beginning in 2018:
 If future contributions were equal to $5.1M (or the
recommended contribution if lower), the funding level is
projected to reach 100% in 2031 (end of the 14-year
amortization period) with recommended contributions dropping
below $5.1M in 2022.
 The recommended contribution ranges from $4.9M in
2022 down to $0.8M in 2032.
 If the recommended contribution is made beginning in 2019,
the Plan is expected to achieve 100% funding in 2031 (end of
the 14-year amortization period) and the recommended
amount is projected to drop below $5.1M in 2022.
 The recommended contribution ranges from $5.9M in
2019 down to $4.7M in 2022 and $0.8M in 2032.
Due to the Plan’s size and nature, future investment returns have a
significant impact on projected liabilities – we would keep the Board
apprised of the impact of the Plan’s investment performance on
future costs.

Projections
 14.2% preliminary net return in 2017, 7.50% in all future years
 Reflects a $4.6 million contribution in 2017 and a $5.1 million
contribution in 2018.
 Assets reflect a preliminary market rate of return of 14.2%, net of
investment expenses, in 2017, and assumes a market rate of return
of 7.50%, net of investment expenses, in each future year thereafter.
 Assumes all other assumptions were met in 2017 and each future
year.
 As of 1/1/2017, the amortization period is 14 years.
Next Steps
 We would continue to monitor and review the following items going
forward:
 The Plan’s funding level and recommended contribution
amount.
 Actuarial assumptions and methods:
 The Trustees of the RTD Salaried Employees’ Pension
Plan were considering lowering the interest assumption
– which would increase Plan liabilities and lower the
benchmark for future investment returns.
 Policies adopted by other public pension plan systems.
 All such items would be reviewed by Rael & Letson and discussed
with the Board annually.
Director Hoy asked what would be the disadvantage of funding more in
order to reach full funding faster.
Ms. McKillop stated that RTD should be funding closer to the level of the
actuarial recommendation of 7.3%. She added that the agency had not been
had a situation where performance for investment was up in some time.
Ms. Londa stated that the 14.2% return for 2017 painted a different picture
for the funding status of the pension plan.
Ms. McKillop explained that the trustees concern was that it was unlikely
that the investment rate would continue at the same rate of return and that
was why she recommended a slight increase rate of investment each year in
order to get achieve full funding of the plan earlier than projected and to set
the agency up for better plans for the future.
Director Hoy clarified that the goal was to get to full funding sooner.
Director Hoy ask who made the investment decisions.

Ms. McKillop explained that at this time last year RTD was forecasted to
have to transfer money from the base system to FasTracks, and currently
that would not have to happen. She added that the FISA account was
already being drawn down and that also was not needed. Ms. McKillop
stated that the financial position was substantially better than last year due

- Continued refunding of reserve fund balances
- Increased O&M costs
- Completion of ongoing FasTracks projects
- Funding of currently unfunded FasTracks corridors
- Debt service coverage (combined) of 1.2x may require
o Higher reserve balances
o Reduction in expense projects
o Other sources of funds
Next Steps
 June 26 – Adoption of 2018 Amended Budget
 July 10 – Presentation of second draft mid-term financial plan at FAAC,
first draft long-range financial plan
 August 14 – Presentation of third draft mid-term financial plan, second
draft long-range financial plan
 September 11 – Presentation of final mid-term and long-range financial
plan, and 2019 Requested Budget at FAAC
 September 18 – Adoption of mid-term and long-range financial plans
Ms. McKillop stated that this is the planned schedule but she said that the
outcome of the Pass Program Working Group (PPWG) would have an impact
on the schedule because the current plan assumes a fare increase and that
there may be revisions due to adoption of the PPWG recommendation.
Director Broom stated that listed under uncontrollable variables were interest
rates on debt and asked if the agency had variable rate debt, how much of
this type of debt, and how much the rates increased.
Ms. Scarpino explained that must be a mistake and the RTD debt was all at
a fixed rate.

Ms. McKillop stated that she would provide that list of all the projects being
considered for the $65 million in project requests (capital and expense) that
need to be eliminated, reduced, or deferred in Base System.
Director Lubow asked if the North Metro Line would be completed to State
Highway 7 or to 124th Avenue within the six year plan.

Director Lubow asked what the consequences would be for not making the
1.2 times debt service coverage requirement.
Ms. McKillop stated that she had met with the rating agencies because the
agency had not met the required debt ratio and were not expected to meet it
the last plan. She added that rating agencies would receive a copy of RTD’s
short-term and long-term model to be aware of any problems the agency
may encounter. Ms. McKillop stated that the consequences would be that
both RTD COPs and outstanding bonds were downgraded, that RTD had
high ratings which meant that RTD interest rates when bonds were issued
were lower, and that RTD had been able to take an advantage because the
agency was well respected in the investment community for high, solid
COPs or bonds. She stated that RTD was not expecting issued debt in the
near future and any issued debt would be subject to a new rating. Ms.
McKillop stated that the other issue was that the agency may be violating a
Board policy by not maintaining the required 1.2 times debt service
coverage. She explained that in the financial plan last year the agency was
expected to meet the requirement in 2026 and this year was expected to
meet it in 2023, so there was improvement. Ms. McKillop stated that the
financial department was working on determining what it would take to
meet the debt service coverage requirement in 2019 and if the agency could
afford that.
Director Lubow asked when the Board would receive a cash flow graph.
Ms. McKillop stated that the cash flow graph would be included in the long–
term financial plan.

Fare Box Revenue targets were set by the RTD Board of Directors
The Board’s Fiscal Policy Statement directs staff to plan on a fare
adjustment every three (3) years to adjust to inflation
 Policy directs staff to review potential fare adjustments to establish a
fare structure to ensure that it:
o Is understandable
o Is implementable
o Is equitable
 Achieves the revenue levels established in the Mid-Range Financial
Plan (Formerly SBP & APE)
 The current Mid-Term Financial Plan for 2018-2023 incorporates a
planned fare increase assumption in both 2019 and 2022.
o Approximately 10% in 2019 and 10% in 2022
Current Fare Structure
 $2.60 for Regional
 $9.00 for airport
2019 Fare Change Proposal Three Alternatives
 Primary Fare Change Proposal Elements:
o 3-Hour Pass to replace One-way Trip with 3-hour transfer
o EcoPass, NECOPass and CollegePass - Price based upon the
previous year’s utilization
o FlexPass – Retain without discount
o MyRide – Retain without discount ($0.25)
o 10-Ride Ticket Book – Retain without discount (10%)
o ValuPass – Discontinue (purchase 12 monthly passes instead)
 Three Alternatives Summary
o No Increase in the Base Fare
 Doesn’t generate enough revenue to meet fare targets in
current SBP/APE
 Insufficient revenue generated by eliminating discounts and
transitioning to utilization pricing for pass programs to
introduce 70% discount for Youth or Low Income Program
o Regularly Scheduled Fare Change
 Local One-Way $2.60 to $2.90
 Regional One-Way $4.50 to $5.00
 Airport One-Way $9.00 to $10.00
o Pass Program Working Group Recommendation
 Local One-Way $2.60 to $3.00
 Regional One-Way $4.50 to $5.25
 Airport One-Way $9.00 to $10.50
 70% discount for Youth
 Maintain Nonprofit Program (Adult & Senior/Disabled
products offered at 50% discount on the full fare;

Youth at 70% discount)
 70% discount for Youth

 40% discount through the Low Income Program
o Alternative 1: No Increase in Base Fare: Modeling Results
 Leaving the Base Fares unchanged results in a sizeable
revenue shortfall (-$36 million) compared to the cumulative
Strategic Budget Plan fare revenue target for 2019-2021
 This revenue shortfall remains sizable, even with the
elimination of some fare discounts (e.g.: FlexPass, MyRide,
ValuPass, etc.)
 Compared to the Baseline, this alternative results in higher
ridership, due to the lower Base Fare
o Alternative 2: Regularly Scheduled Fare Change: Modeling Results
 The Regularly scheduled fare change would result in
revenue slightly below (-$2 million) the cumulative
Strategic Budget Plan fare revenue target for 2019-2021
 Compared to the Baseline, the Recommendation results in
a very slight increase in ridership, due in part to the greater
discount offered to Youth customers
o Alternative 3: PPWG Recommendation
 The PPWG recommendation is slightly below (-$2 million)
the cumulative Strategic Budget Plan fare revenue target
for 2019-2021
 Compared to the Baseline, the Recommendation results in
a slight increase in ridership, due in part to the introduction
of the Low Income Program
Still Evaluating: Staff continues to evaluate implementation of the LowIncome program and Youth discount:
o Low-Income Fare and Youth Fare
o What will it take to apply the discount to all products
o Which fare product(s)/media would allow for the lowest
implementation cost
o Which fare product(s)/media would allow for the soonest
implementation
o Which fare product(s)/media would allow for the simplest
operator/customer interaction
o Is mobile ticketing an accessible option
o Administration: means-testing, proof of eligibility, fare product
acquisition, etc.
o Is the 12 and under free enforceable
Public Engagement Strategy: Guiding Principles

process presenting the three option but that these three option may change
due to staff and public recommendations. She added that the options would
be presented in order to give the public something to respond to and provide
comments.

Director Broom asked what the cost would be to implement the change that
kept the existing fare schedule and increase all fares by 10% and offer the
40% discount.

Director Sisk stated that it was expensive to provide the program.
Ms. McKillop explained that was why it would be difficult to implement the
alternative and that the PPWG option balanced a new fare structure.
Mr. Washington stated that the revenue loss was shaded with that
alternative because it was largely dependent upon the type of fare media
and the fare to apply the discount. He explained that if the discount was
applied to unlimited monthly pass there would be a much greater revenue
loss than if the discount would be applied to a stored value MyRide card.
Ms. McKillop agreed with Mr. Washington and explained that the shortfall
was dependent on how the discount would be offered to the public.
Director Broom asked if there would be costs estimates provided for several
different discount percentage amounts.
Ms. McKillop explained that there was not enough money to offer several
different discount options and that it would require a significant raise in the
current base fare.
Director Williams stated that the modeling results of the three alternatives
reported that the revenue loss was relatively small and that, by not
implementing a new fare program, what the agency may lose in public
opinion and reputation would be significant. She added that there was not a
dollar value to be placed on the reputation of RTD by trying to provide the
discounted service to the public and that the agency needed to make the
best out of all the work that was done. Director Williams asked what
percentage of ridership would bear the fare increase to provide discount for
other riders.
Mr. Washington stated that he did not have that information with him but
would send it to Director Williams.

Ms. McKillop stated that the total cost of the program was between $11
and $12 million to implement the 40% discount. She explained that
approximately $6.8 million was applied to the current discount program and
it would cost an additional $7 to $8 million because RTD actually only
receives about half of the $6.8 million to implement the 40% discount
alternative.

Director Anderson stated that she was concerned the outreach would not
include the people that pay the regular fare. She added that she did not
agree that part of RTD riders should be paying for others, which she stated
was unfair. Director Anderson stated she agreed with the plan for children
riding free with a parent or responsible person. She added that the income
level needed to be transparent and that she would like to see an option
where the agency reduced all fares in order to increase ridership. She asked
what routes and services would be impacted by implementing any low
income program.
Ms. McKillop stated that an option to eliminate all discounts, except for
federally mandated discounts, to try to get fares as low as possible was
examined but that resulted in a tremendous amount loss in ridership.
Director Anderson stated that RTD should figure out how to provide the
lowest fares possible and increase ridership and have the taxpayers
subsidize that amount.
Ms. McKillop stated she would provide the modeling results of reducing all
fares option.
Director Anderson stated that the agency had provided the Eco and college
passes and that the options appeared to eliminate those programs.
Ms. McKillop stated that all options keep the ECO, NICO, and college
passes.
Director Anderson stated that the person that does not receive discount
passes and fares pays for the people who do.
Director Lubow stated that the ridership declined on both option 2 and 3 and
why would RTD provide a low income pass that caused ridership to go
down.
Mr. Washington explained that ridership decline was due to the sensitivity to
price increases and that people would ride less if it cost more to ride. He
added that using fares to gain the revenue needed to provide a discounted
pass begin to eat away at the goal to gain ridership.

Director Menten commented that there needed to be more than five
outreach meetings and that five meeting would possibly work if there was
enough advertising and the meetings were held at convenient locations and
hours. She added that the meetings should share the information to the
taxpayers regarding the subsidy and what the current cost was and how it
would increase.

6.E

Ms. McKillop stated that both options 2 and 3 tried to keep the ridership as
high as possible by how passes were implemented.
Director Lubow asked if in option 3 if there would no longer be a nonprofit
program but still have the 50% government requirements.

Director Lubow asked whether nonprofit organizations be negatively
impacted from option 3.
Mr. Washington stated that it would allow nonprofit organizations to expand
the rate at which they can contribute to the transportation services
provided.
Director Lubow asked if there was data that showed ridership decreased
because of the deletion of MyRide and the ten-ride fare book.
Ms. McKillop stated that it was a very small portion that impacted ridership
related to those passes.
Director Lubow asked if those people who were low income but did not
qualify for the low income pass were losing a discount and had to pay
increased fares. She also asked who the riders were that RTD was losing.
Mr. Washington explained that ridership loss came from the increase of the
base fare to $3.00.
Ms. McKillop stated that it was hard to measure exactly which riders RTD
would lose and that currently there was no statistical information to
determine if it would impact cash fare payers.
Director Lubow suggest having a Telephone Town Hall to reach plenty of
people.
Chair Tisdale stated that in the presentation option 2 included senior and
disabled discounts but noted that those are not included in option 3 and
asked to verify that those discounts were federally mandated and regardless
of the option that was being assessed.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 15, 2018 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Mr. Washington explained that nonprofit organizations would be able to
purchase fare media on behalf of individuals but that it would not be the
nonprofit program in place currently. He added that there would not be a cap
on the amount of fare media to be purchased on behalf low-income
individuals as there currently is a limit.

6.E

Mr. Washington explained that wording was difficult but that it was
supposed to communicate that there would not be a way to receive a
discount on a discount.
Chair Tisdale asked if the information on page 14 regarding ridership
numbers was equivalent to boardings.

Chair Tisdale stated that RTD reported that in 2017 the agency had 101
million boardings and was projecting, in any of the options, to significantly
fall short of that number.
Ms. McKillop stated that data reports a 1% to a 1.5% decrease in ridership
every year.
Chair Tisdale stated that the Board was interested in the public comments.
Director Archueta asked if the agency would consider changing the fare
increase timing to every five years rather than every three years.
Director Walker stated that he looked at the way these options as a
household benefit and that he did not agree that it was RTD’s mission to
increase ridership but rather to provide the needs to the customers. He
expressed concern that ridership loss would resulted in service cuts and
eliminating discounts to pay for discounts would hurt a lot of riders that
would not qualify for the low in come pass. He asked if the cost of gas was
included in the model.
Mr. Washington explained that gas was not included and the study was a
sensitivity to price model.
Director Walker stated that gas, parking, and transit oriented development all
impact ridership.
Director Hoy stated that all options showed that when the agency gave
something away, the fares increased and it shows that someone else pays
for someone else’s fare. He added that the person who pays the cash fare
was paying for someone’s discounted fare. He asked how the 70% youth
discount was calculated.
Mr. Washington explained that it was calculated at 70% discount off of the
base fare.
Director Hoy stated that, as a director of a suburb, he would not underwrite
the Denver Public School district because children that go to school in other

areas do not take the RTD bus. He added that means that the people in the
suburbs subsidizes the urban areas. He stated that he was surprised that
there was not an option 4 that was just a fare increase and that every
option that had a fare increase there was a new discount and that the pass
program was tied to increasing the fares.

Director Hoy agreed with Director Anderson and stated that RTD was not a
social agency but a bus company and responsible for moving people. He
added that was not an RTD decision was who should receive discounted
fares and that it was RTD’s decision to give a great service to all the district.
Directory Hoy stated that the issue with the programs was that someone
would pay more money to give somebody else a free ride and that it was
taking money from A to give it to B, and the taxpayers all pay more.
Mr. Washington stated that the 10 cent difference in Alternative 2 and 3
was to allow the low income program to not have a cap on the amount of
discounted fare revenue to be purchased for low income individuals and was
not to pay for a discounted youth fare.
Director Catlin asked to see more information on the cost to implement any
of the alternatives or similar programs and to have the in formation available
for the public.
Ms. McKillop explained that was being worked on and would be provided.
Director Catlin expressed concern that RTD was presenting the PPWG
alternatives to the public at the same time as making service changes.
Director Menten agreed with Director Hoy and stated that she believed that
ridership was decreasing because of time. She stated that RTD should get
rid of low discount fares and should keep the ECO pass and flex pass.
Director Menten stated the Board members were to be the stewards of the
taxpayers’ money.

• 2018 1st Quarter Performance Measure Report
Ms. McKillop asked if there were any question regarding the 1st Quarter
Performance Measure Report that was included in the Board packet. She

goals except in ridership, fare revenue, and operator headcount.

• March 2018 Monthly Financial Status Report

• Quarterly Investment Report
Ms. McKillop stated that the agency investments were performing well and
the rising interest rates had resulted in an estimated few million dollar
increase. She added that the report included new charts that show the
benchmark for earnings and the agency’s benchmarks were ahead of the
earning curve.

D. Other Matters
Director Menten asked where the agency would take money from reserves to pay
for the betterments for other entities and when the Board would receive a report on
the local matching amounts for these projects.
Ms. McKillop stated was working on the report.

Mr. Stopplecamp stated that Mr. Schear had worked in the construction group for past 17
years and that his role as an inspector was very valuable to ensure that the district was
being provided the best possible construction and exactly what was required for a project.
He added that Mr. Schear was visible and volunteered for many investigations during the
night to ensure proper operations and regulations. Mr. Stopplecamp thanked Mr. Schear for
his dedication.
Chair Tisdale recognized Jim Sutton for his 27 years of exemplary service to RTD as the
Manager of Asset Management.

Public Participation
Chair Tisdale stated that the public participation period was open to anyone who wanted
to speak. He explained that elected officials were invited to speak first, and others would
be called in the order they signed up, and then additional speakers would be invited at the
end of the list. He reminded the audience that each speaker was allowed three minutes
and to approach the lectern when called and state their name and address. Chair Tisdale
asked that if any speaker had documentation or reference materials for the Board to give
those materials to the Board staff prior to speaking.
Steven Meyer, Denver, stated that the residents of Sunset Park Apartments object to the
removal of Bus Stop Number 17750 that was proposed to be eliminated for the May 20,
2018 Service Changes. He added that the bus stop was valuable to RTD ridership and
accommodates the senior, disabled, severely disabled and non-English speaking residents
at Sunset Park. Mr. Meyers explained that the residents were a mix of seniors from varied
backgrounds and needs who depended on the close proximity of the bus stop to allow
routes 9, 38, and 52 that transport the residents to shopping, work, doctors, and other
important destinations, because 99% of the residents did not drive cars. He asked the
Board to reconsider the decision to eliminate the bus stop that currently served the 270
residents and asked for RTD to provide a presentation to inform the residents of RTD
services in order to improve ridership at that location.
Joann Trudell, Denver, on behalf of the people that unable to attend from the Sunset Park
Apartments, stated that the residents needed the bus stop directly outside the apartments
and asked RTD not to not eliminate the stop.
Jacquie Koewler, Denver, Board Member of The Gathering Place, encouraged the Board to
accept the recommendations of the Pass Program Working Group (PPWG) to implement a

Programs, would say a few words on Mr. Schear’s behalf.

low-income bus pass program and to keep the 50% discount for non-profits organizations
that maximized the number of passes that would be provided to those in need. She added
that many people relied on the bus as a lifeline to work, education, shelters, and affordable
housing. Ms. Koewler asked the Board to take into consideration the population that really
needed the bus in order to survive.
Reagan Bird, Denver, a former RTD candidate, asked the Board to consider the public
outcry regarding service changes and providing a low-income pass. She urged the Board to
take affordability and access seriously. Ms. Byrd asked that RTD develop a forum so that
citizens did not have to continue to come to the Board to express concerns. She added
that she advocated for the PPWG recommendations for a low-income pass. Ms. Byrd
stated that she was surprised about the bill at the state level that would limit RTD’s ability
to implement a low-income pass. She asked that RTD, the Board, and the community be
involved in strategizing how to do better.
Will Anderson, Denver, stated that there were many people in the district that needed an
income based bus pass because they cannot afford a bus pass increase and relied on RTD
buses. He urged RTD to keep an income-based pass and make sure the State Senate does
not take that power away from RTD.
Jenee Elise Donelson, 9to5, and Rocky Mountain Bus Riders Union, stated that in July
2016, before the PPWG was created, the RTD senior staff and Board discussed raising
fares by 10%. She added that the message presented by the staff regarding the income
based pass was damaging and false. Ms. Donelson stated that the discounts discussed
were not handouts and should not become an excuse to raise fares. She added that RTD
money woes were not the fault of the public that depend on RTD service. Ms. Donelson
stated that during Director Anderson’s town hall Heather McKillop, Chief Financial Officer,
discussed that a fare increase was to be discussed in the near future. She added that a
fare increase should not be imposed without public input. Ms. Donelson stated that cutting
service and adding more light rail lines that do not service neighborhoods was a civil rights
issue. She asked that RTD hold a diversity training meeting for staff and to find other
ways to increase revenue than to reduce service and increase fares to the people that rely
on transit and keep the city running.
Kristen Siedel, Denver, on behalf of Woman’s Collaborative for Colorado (WCC), stated
that many clients used the current discount fares provided by RTD. She added that the
fare programs were essential to WCC work and how the groups assisted clients to get to
work, school, and other programs. Ms. Siedel stated that WCC supported the incomebased pass presented by the PPWG at a 50% discount. She stated that had brought
several stories from the Delores Project that provided shelter to homeless women and
children. She explained that these women were unable to attend do to the curfew at the

Packet Pg. 69

shelter. Ms. Siedel shared a written statement that said that being homeless was difficult
enough and the bus passes that were issued from the Delores project had helped women
get their lives back together. She added that the RTD daily pass allowed women to board
a safe bus and return to a shelter. Ms. Siedel shared a second testament that stated that
RTD service was needed especially by mobility-impaired patrons, seniors on fixed incomes,
and other disadvantaged groups. She stated that these groups needed an income-based
pass to continue to work towards ways to better their lives. Ms. Siedel stated that she
wanted to remind the Board members that it was an election year and that they were all
elected officials and should act like it.

Chair Tisdale asked General Manager Genova to share his report.
General Manager Genova stated that the written report was included in the Board packet
and highlighted the following activities:
 The Colorado Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) received certification from the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) for the State System Oversight Program that
would meet all new regulatory requirements for fixed guideways operations (light
rail, commuter rail, and heavy rail). General Manager Genova explained that the FTA
had set a deadline for all states to be certified by April 2019. He added that states
did not meet the deadline would lose all federal funding and that Colorado was one
of eight states that had completed the certification process.
 The North Carolina Department of Transportation, Deputy Secretary, David Howard
visited RTD and toured the Denver Union Station. General Manger Genova
discussed RTD financial models to complete the Eagle Project, Denver Union
Station, and how RTD organized the buildout of FasTracks. He added that North
Carolina was looking to start similar projects.
 Wednesday, April 25 staff would attend the Mobility Choice Board Meeting and
that RTD had a small section on that agenda to discuss RTD mobility strategy and
about transportation transformation. General Manager Genova stated that staff
would also update the Board on the Request for Information (RFI) RTD issued
regarding different mobility issues and how RTD would work with local jurisdiction
transportation staff to have a regional mobility dialog.
 The CPUC approval on the grade crossing design was a huge milestone but the
written orders have not been received. General Manger Genova stated that staff
continued to move forward and to work closely with the Commission staff and the

Motion:

Director Deadwyler made the motion to approve

Director Williams seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Director Folska, Ph.D., stated that she received an email that
stated that many of the Smart Card readers had not been
working across the district and asked if NewPush was the
company that would make the readers works.
General Manager Genova explained that NewPush was not the
same company and that they have nothing to do with the
Smart Card readers. He added that the readers were
continuously checked and monitored and that staff would look
into the issue.
Director Menten stated the price of the IT contracts were
shocking. She asked about the price differences between the
other bidders for the contract and specifically about how RTD
procurement made the selection of the company.
General Manager Genova explained that RTD had two specific
procurement processes: a Request for Proposal (RFP) and an
Invitation for Bid (IFB). He stated that the contract was issued
as an RFP where RTD used best value procurement to evaluate
the bidders. General Manager Genova explained that the RFP
included other requirements, in addition to the cost, to meet
the contract requirements. He added that the evaluation team
was made up of a both technical and contract staff. He stated

GM
Board Meeting Date: May 22, 2018

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
accept and enter into the record the District’s audited financial reports relating to the year ended
December 31, 2017 as prepared by staff and audited by RTD's independent auditor, RubinBrown, LLP.
GM CORE AND TASK GOALS MET
Core Goal #3: Strong Financial Management
Task Goal #1: Fiscal Sustainability
BACKGROUND
State statutes require an annual audit by independent certified public accountants. RTD is also required
to provide annual audited financial statements to external entities and other government organizations to
be in full compliance with legal covenants, debt agreements, and other contractual documents. The
accounting firm of RubinBrown, LLP performed the 2017 audit. In addition to the requirements set forth
in state statutes, the audit also was designed to fulfill the requirements of the federal Single Audit Act of
1984 and related OMB circular A-133.
DISCUSSION
As stated in the auditor’s unmodified opinion, the financial statements in the enclosed Comprehensive
Annual Financial Report (CAFR) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of RTD as of
December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flow for the 2017 and
2016 fiscal years in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors accept and enter into the record the District’s audited financial reports relating to the
year ended December 31, 2017 as prepared by staff and audited by RTD's independent auditor,
RubinBrown, LLP.
2. Do not accept and enter into the record the audited financial reports relating to the year ended
December 31, 2017 as prepared by staff and audited by RTD’s independent auditor, RubinBrown,
LLP. This is not the recommended action, since state statutes and other sources, such as rating
agencies and other legal covenants, require RTD to enter annual audited financial statements into
the record.

Board of Directors
Regional Transportation District
Denver, Colorado
In accordance with Colorado statutes and Regional Transportation District (RTD) bylaws, the enclosed Comprehensive Annual Financial
Report of the Regional Transportation District as of December 31, 2017, has been compiled. Responsibility for the accuracy of the
presented data and the completeness and fairness of the presentation, including all disclosures, rests with RTD. Management believes
the data, as presented, fairly sets forth the financial position and operating results of RTD. Disclosures necessary to enable the reader
to gain the maximum understanding of the financial affairs of RTD have been included.
In developing and evaluating RTD’s accounting system, consideration has been given to the adequacy of internal accounting controls.
These controls are discussed by the Chief Financial Officer in the Letter of Transmittal. Within that framework, we believe RTD’s
internal accounting controls adequately safeguard assets and provide reasonable assurance of the proper recording of financial
transactions.
This report has been prepared according to the guidelines recommended by the Government Finance Officers Association of the United
States and Canada. In accordance with these guidelines, the accompanying report is presented in three parts:
1.

Introductory Section, including the Chief Financial Officer’s Letter of Transmittal.

2.

Financial Section containing the independent auditor’s report, Management’s Discussion and Analysis, the financial
statements, notes thereto and supplemental information.

3.

Statistical Section, including selected tables of unaudited data depicting the financial history of RTD, demographics, and
other miscellaneous information.

Colorado law requires the governing bodies of local governments to have an independent audit of RTD’s financial statements
performed. RTD has complied with this requirement and has included the report of the independent auditors in the Financial Section
of this report.
Preparation of this Comprehensive Annual Financial Report could not have been accomplished without the dedicated efforts of the
entire financial staff. Should you have any questions or comments, please contact Heather McKillop, Chief Financial Officer.
Respectfully submitted,
Doug Tisdale

Mr. Doug Tisdale
Chair, Executive Committee
Regional Transportation District
State law requires that all general-purpose local governments publish within seven months of the close of each fiscal year a
complete set of financial statements presented in conformance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and
audited in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards by a firm of licensed certified public accountants. Pursuant
to that requirement, we hereby issue the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report of the Regional Transportation District (RTD)
for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.
This report consists of management’s representations concerning the finances of RTD. Consequently, management assumes
full responsibility for the completeness and reliability of all of the information presented in this report. To provide a reasonable
basis for making these representations, management of RTD has established a comprehensive internal control framework that
is designed both to protect the government’s assets from loss, theft, or misuse and to compile sufficient, reliable information
for the preparation of RTD’s financial statements in conformity with GAAP. Because the cost of internal controls should not
outweigh their benefits, RTD’s comprehensive framework of internal controls has been designed to provide reasonable rather
than absolute assurance that the financial statements will be free from material misstatement. As management, we assert that,
to the best of our knowledge and belief, this financial report is complete and reliable in all material respects.
RTD’s financial statements have been audited by RubinBrown, LLP, a firm of licensed certified public accountants. The goal of
the independent audit was to provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements of RTD for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2017, are free of material misstatement. The independent audit involved examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements; assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management; and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. The independent auditor
concluded, based upon the audit, that there was a reasonable basis for rendering an unmodified opinion that RTD’s financial
statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, are fairly presented in conformity with GAAP. The independent
auditor’s report is presented as the first component of the Financial Section of this report.
The independent audit of the financial statements of RTD was part of a broader, federally mandated “Single Audit” designed to
meet the special needs of federal grantor agencies. The standards governing Single Audit engagements require the independent
auditor to report not only on the fair presentation of the financial statements, but also on the audited government’s internal
controls and compliance with legal requirements, with special emphasis on internal controls and legal requirements involving
the administration of federal awards. These reports are in RTD’s separately issued Single Audit Report.
GAAP requires that management provide a narrative introduction, overview, and analysis to accompany the basic financial
statements in the form of Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A). This letter of transmittal is designed to complement
the MD&A and should be read in conjunction with it. RTD’s MD&A can be found immediately following the report of the
independent auditors.
REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT (RTD)
RTD provides public mass transit service to the Denver metropolitan area. In 1969, the Colorado General Assembly (Assembly)
found that public transit was a necessary part of the growing Denver Metropolitan Region. The Assembly found that public

11.A.a

RTD boundaries now include Jefferson, Boulder, and Denver counties, most of the City and County of Broomfield, and portions
of Adams, Douglas, Weld, and Arapahoe counties. Over 2.92 million people reside within RTD’s 2,342 square mile area.
Since 1983, RTD has had a fifteen-member Board of Directors that are elected by their constituents to serve four-year terms
to govern RTD. There are approximately 180,000 residents per director district. The RTD Board of Directors is responsible for
setting policy, overseeing the agency’s annual budget, and establishing short and long-range transit goals and plans in concert
with local, state, and federal agencies.
RTD employs over 2,779 men and women, making it one of the largest employers in the eight county areas. In addition, RTD
contracts with private carriers to provide access-a-ride, fixed route and commuter rail services employing over 2,058 men and
women. Besides its administrative headquarters in Denver, RTD has seven operating facilities (excluding purchased
transportation services), including four in Denver, one in Aurora, one in Englewood, and one in Boulder.
The financial reporting entity includes all of the financial activities of RTD, as well as those activities of its component unit,
the Asset Acquisition Authority, Inc. (the Authority), a nonprofit corporation established to facilitate RTD’s use of
lease/purchase financing.
RTD also maintains budgetary controls. These controls ensure compliance with legal provisions embodied in the annual
appropriated budget approved by RTD’s Board of Directors. The budget sets forth proposed outlays for operations, planning,
administration, development, debt service, and capital assets. The level of budgetary control (that is, the level at which
expenditures cannot legally exceed the appropriated amount) is established at the project level.
The annual budget serves as the foundation for RTD’s financial planning and control. All departments of RTD are required to
submit requests for appropriation to the General Manager on or before August 1st of each year. The General Manager uses
these requests as the starting point for developing a proposed budget. The General Manager then presents this proposed budget
to the Board of Directors for review prior to October 15th. The Board of Directors is required to hold a public hearing on the
proposed budget and to adopt a final budget no later than December 31st.
Unused appropriations lapse at year-end, except that the Board of Directors has the authority, as stated in the adopted
appropriation resolution, to carry-over the unused portion of the funds for capital projects not completed, for a period not to
exceed three years.
RTD’s policy also authorizes the General Manager to approve certain line-item transfers within the budget. Budget-to-actual
comparisons are provided in the Supplemental Information Section of this report.
Factors Affecting Financial Condition
The information presented in the financial statements is perhaps best understood when it is considered in the broader
perspective of the specific environment within which RTD operates.
RTD serves the eight-county region considered the Denver metropolitan area. It is the most populated area of the state and
the economic barometer of Colorado. Employment in the Denver Metro area is dominated by small businesses. These companies
represent a diverse mix of industries and are located throughout the Denver metropolitan area, providing a geographic balance
in employment centers.

sector involvement was the best method to ensure the continuation of this vital component. Thus, the Regional Transportation
District was created as a political subdivision of the State effective July 1969 “to develop, maintain, and operate a public
mass transportation system for the benefit of the District.”

On November 3, 1992, the voters of Colorado approved a Constitutional Amendment (the “Amendment”) that limits taxes,
revenue, and spending for state and local governments effective December 31, 1992. On November 7, 1995, the voters of the
District exempted RTD from the revenue and spending limitations concerning the Amendment through December 31, 2005. On
November 2, 1999, the voters of the District further exempted RTD from the revenue and spending limitations outlined in the
Amendment for the purpose of paying any debt incurred to finance the construction of the Southeast and Southwest light rail
lines or to operate such for as long as any debt remains outstanding, but in no event beyond December 31, 2026.
On November 2, 2004, the voters of the District authorized an increase in the District’s sales and use tax rate from 0.6% to
1.0%, effective January 1, 2005, to finance the FasTracks transit improvement program. This authorization also exempted
the District from any revenue and spending limitations on the additional tax and on any investment income generated by the
increased tax revenue, and allowed RTD to incur debt to finance the capital improvements included in the FasTracks program.
At the time that all FasTracks debt is repaid, the District’s sales and use tax rate will be reduced to a rate sufficient to operate
the transit system financed through FasTracks.
Long-term Financial Planning
Each year the Board of Directors adopts a financially constrained Strategic Budget Plan (SBP), which is the six-year operating
and capital improvement plan of RTD excluding FasTracks. Historically, FasTracks has been excluded from the SBP because
the program was primarily for capital expansion. In addition, the Board of Directors adopts a financially constrained Annual
Program Evaluation (APE), (which is a six-year operating and capital improvement plan that includes the FasTracks
program). The SBP and APE are components of the long-term transportation planning program for the Denver metropolitan
area evaluated by the Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG). As the FasTracks program continues to transition
from capital expansion to operations, RTD will migrate the SBP and APE into a single short, medium and long-term Financial
Plan which will include the entirety of RTD in a single report. This financial information forms the basis for the development
of RTD’s annual budget.
The long-term financial planning seeks to allocate resources among related and, at times, competing activities and to optimize
those resources in a manner consistent with defined organizational goals and objectives.
FINANCIAL INFORMATION
RTD management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an internal control structure designed to ensure that assets
are protected from loss, theft, or misuse and that adequate accounting data are compiled to allow for the preparation of
financial statements in conformity with GAAP. RTD has designed its internal control structure to provide reasonable, but not
absolute, assurance that these objectives are met. The concept of reasonable assurance recognizes that: (1) the costs of a
control should not exceed the benefits likely to be derived and (2) the valuation of costs and benefits requires estimates and
judgment by management.

The Colorado Legislative Council (CLC) in its March 2018 report forecasts that the economy is expected to grow at a more
moderate pace; demographic change, growing inflationary pressures and rising interest rates will slow consumer spending.
Economists for CLC reported the following key economic indicators:

11.A.a

As part of RTD’s single audit, tests are made to determine the adequacy of the internal control structure, including that portion
related to federal financial assistance programs, as well as to evaluate RTD’s compliance. RTD’s single audit for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2017 found no instances of material weakness in the internal control structures or significant
violations of applicable laws and regulations. A separate report was prepared for this purpose.
Fiscal Policy: RTD follows a fiscal policy approved by the Board of Directors annually or as necessary due to modification.
The fiscal policy contains policies for revenue, investments, expenditures, capital improvements, fund balance, debt, budgeting,
accounting and grants.
Debt Administration: RTD formulates its debt policy to protect its credit ratings and soundly manage its assets and liabilities.
Included in this policy is a requirement that debt will not be used to finance current operations. Another requirement precludes
financing capital projects beyond the useful life of the project. Additional policies go beyond these essential guidelines and
result in further protection. RTD has a dual rating for its 1.0% sales tax credit. Moody’s Investors Service rates the sales tax
credit as “Aa1”, Standard and Poor’s Corporation rates the sales tax credit “AAA” and Fitch Ratings rates the sales tax credit
“AA” that are secured by the 0.6% sales tax. Moody’s Investors Service rates the sales tax credit as “Aa2”, Standard and
Poor’s Corporation rates the sales tax credit “AA+” and Fitch Ratings rates the sales tax credit “AA” that are secured by the
0.4% sales tax.
Cash Management: The main objective of RTD’s cash management program is the protection of investment principal while
providing optimal levels of cash throughout the year. The RTD investment policy is modified periodically to adapt to changes
in eligible investments, benchmarks, and specific objectives.
During the year, RTD invested its cash in various investment vehicles including money market funds, U.S. Treasury securities,
agency securities, discount notes, commercial paper, repurchase agreements, and variable and fixed rate mortgage-backed
securities. The total average return on investments for the year was 1.4%.
Risk Management: RTD employs a combination of self-insurance and purchased insurance in its efforts to protect assets and
control and prevent losses.
The areas of self-insurance are worker’s compensation, automobile and general liability. RTD is self-insured for liability, the
limits of which are $387,000 per person and $1,093,000 per occurrence as specified under the Colorado Governmental
Immunity statute. The self-insured retention for worker’s compensation claims is $2,000,000 per claim, with any amounts
above this covered by purchased insurance up to the legal limits of liability under the Colorado worker’s compensation statute.
Commercial insurance policies provide property coverage up to $1,663,245,896 for buildings, their contents, and rolling stock
(other than collision); a Commercial Crime Policy and Faithful Performance Bond; a $3,500,000 Workers’ Compensation Bond;
Felonious Assault Policy; travel insurance for employees on RTD business; fidelity coverage on the Trustees of the Union
Pension Trust, Salaried Pension Trust, Represented Health and Welfare Union Trust, Legal Trust, and the employees
administering the health benefits program for salaried employees. With the growth of Light Rail Transit (LRT) services, RTD
has added Railroad Protective and Railroad Liability commercial insurance policies that provide coverage when required under
operational needs.
The Risk Management Division coordinates these programs internally for RTD.

Single Audit: As a recipient of federal assistance, RTD is responsible for ensuring that an adequate internal control structure
is instituted to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations related to those programs. This internal control
structure is subject to periodic evaluation by management and the RTD internal audit staff.

11.A.a

Independent Audit: State statutes require an annual audit by independent certified public accountants. The accounting firm
of RubinBrown LLP was selected to perform the 2017 audit. This audit also was designated to meet the requirements of the
Federal Single Audit 2 CFR 200.501, Uniform Grant Guidance and related 2 CFR 200, Uniform Grant Guidance – Uniform
Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles and Audit Requirements. The auditor’s report on the financial statements and
schedules are included in the Financial Section of this report. The auditor’s report related specifically to the single audit is
included in a separate report.
Awards: The Government Finance Officers Associations (GFOA) awarded a Certificate of Achievement for Excellence in
Financial Reporting to RTD for its Comprehensive Annual Financial Report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. This
is the twenty-fifth consecutive year that RTD has been awarded this prestigious award.
In order to receive the Certificate of Achievement for Excellence in Financial Reporting, RTD must publish an easily readable
and efficiently organized Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the contents of which must conform to program standards.
This report must also satisfy both GAAP and applicable legal requirements.
The Certificate of Achievement is valid for one year only. We believe our current Comprehensive Annual Financial Report meets
the program’s requirements and will be submitting it to the GFOA to determine its eligibility for another certificate.
Acknowledgements: Preparation of the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report on a timely basis was made possible by the
dedicated services of the entire staff of the Finance Division. Each member of the division has our sincere appreciation for the
contributions made in the preparation of this report.
Finally, without the leadership and support of the members of the RTD’s Board of Directors, preparation of this report would
not have been possible.
Sincerely,
Heather McKillop
Chief Financial Officer

Report On The Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the Regional Transportation
District (RTD) as of and for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 and the
related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise RTD’s basic
financial statements as listed in the table of contents.
Management’s Responsibility For The Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial
statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America; this includes the design, implementation and maintenance of
internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditors’ Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our
audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial
audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General
of the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from
material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the
auditors’ judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of
the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk
assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation
and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. Accordingly, we express no
such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting
policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to
provide a basis for our audit opinion.

Opinion
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of RTD as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the
changes in its financial position and its cash flows for the years then ended in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.
Other Matters
Required Supplementary Information
Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that
the management’s discussion and analysis and pension plan summary information on
pages 23 through 35 and 87 through 90, respectively, be presented to supplement the
basic financial statements. Such information, although not a part of the basic financial
statements, is required by Governmental Accounting Standards Board, which considers
it to be an essential part of financial reporting for placing the basic financial statements
in an appropriate operational, economic or historical context. We have applied certain
limited procedures to the required supplementary information in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which consisted
of inquiries of management about the methods of preparing the information and
comparing the information for consistency with management’s responses to our
inquiries, the basic financial statements and other knowledge we obtained during our
audit of the basic financial statements. We do not express an opinion or provide any
assurance on the information because the limited procedures do not provide us with
sufficient evidence to express an opinion or provide any assurance.
Supplementary And Other Information
Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the financial
statements that collectively comprise RTD’s basic financial statements. The
accompanying budgetary information, introductory section and statistical section are
presented for purposes of additional analysis and are not a required part of the basic
financial statements.

11.A.a

The budgetary information is the responsibility of management and was derived from
and relates directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the
basic financial statements. Such information has been subjected to the auditing
procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements and certain additional
procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the
underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements
or to the basic financial statements themselves, and other additional procedures in
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America.
In our opinion, the budgetary information is fairly stated, in all material respects, in
relation to the financial statements as a whole.
The introductory and statistical sections have not been subjected to the auditing
procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements, and accordingly, we do
not express an opinion or provide any assurance on them.
Other Reporting Required By Government Auditing Standards
In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report
dated May 8, 2018 on our consideration of RTD’s internal control over financial
reporting and on our tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations,
contracts and grant agreements and other matters. The purpose of that report is to
describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting and
compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on internal
control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an
audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering
RTD’s internal control over financial reporting and compliance.

The management of the Regional Transportation District (RTD) offers users of our financial statements this narrative overview and analysis
of the financial activities for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. This discussion and analysis is designed to assist the reader
to focus on significant financial activities and identify any significant changes in the financial position of RTD. It should be read in conjunction
with the financial statements that follow this section. All amounts, unless otherwise indicated, are expressed in thousands of dollars.
Key Reporting Implementations
In fiscal year 2016 RTD implemented the provisions of Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Statement No. 72, Fair Value
Measurement and Application, which would generally require state and local governments to measure investments at fair value. GASB's
goal is to enhance the comparability of governmental financial statements by requiring fair value measurement for certain assets and
liabilities using a consistent definition and accepted valuation techniques. This standard expands fair value disclosures to provide
comprehensive information for financial statement users about the impact of fair value measurements on a government's financial position.
Financial Highlights
As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, total assets and deferred outflows of resources of RTD exceeded total liabilities and deferred inflows
of resources by $3,413,509 and $3,322,352 respectively. The amount of unrestricted net position as of December 31, 2017 was
$(223,204) compared to $(214,479) in 2016. RTD’s unrestricted net position was negatively impacted by the implementation of GASB
Statement No. 68, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions (GASB 68). GASB 68 required RTD to record the amount of unfunded
pension liabilities. More information on the pension plans is available in the Notes.
The net position of RTD increased by $91,157 during the current year compared to an increase of $145,414 in the previous year. The
increase for 2017 and 2016 was due to higher operating revenues, sales and use tax and grant revenues, net of increases in operating
expenses and non-operating expenses which resulted from an improving economy combined with revenue enhancement and expense
reduction initiatives undertaken by RTD.
RTD’s sales and use tax revenues are its largest single source of revenues. These tax revenues increased $34,589 (6.1%) in 2017 and
increased $22,080 (4.1%) in the previous year. In 2017 and 2016, The District experienced growth in tax revenues due to increased
consumer and business-spending activity as the District continues to experience population growth of 1.4% and 1.6%, low unemployment
of 2.8% and 3.3% as well as growth in personal income of 3.8% and 1.9%, respectively.
For 2017, total operating expenses exceeded total revenues resulting in a loss before non-operating revenue and expenses of $683,158
compared to a loss of $641,186 for 2016. The increase in operating loss for 2017 was mostly due to FasTracks launch of A and B line
depreciating assets for a full year and betterments for the North Metro and South Corridor Extension build-outs. The increase in operating
loss for 2016 was mostly due to the FasTracks launch of the University of Colorado A line and B line commuter rail, purchased transportation
service. RTD anticipates operating losses, as these losses are subsidized by non-operating sales and use tax, grant revenues and other
miscellaneous income.
RTD’s total debt decreased $93,317 (2.6%) and increased $165,289 (4.8%) in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Debt decreased in 2017 due
to the refunding and partial extinguishment of the DUSPA bonds. Debt increased in 2016 due to issuance of the 2016A FasTracks Sales
Tax Bonds for the purpose of funding additional FasTracks projects.
Capital grants and local contributions decreased $115,840 (57.3%) in 2017 and increased $32,922 (19.4%) in the previous year. The
decrease in 2017 occurred as a result of Eagle P3 project construction being in final phase of completion. The increase in 2016 was a result
of RTD securing a small starts grant for the Southeast Rail Extension, construction of the Civic Center Station and betterments for the I225 corridor.

RTD’s capital assets, excluding depreciation, increased $420,558 in 2017 and increased $634,633 in 2016. The increase in both 2017 and
2016 was primarily due to the build-out of the FasTracks project.
Basic Financial Statements
Management’s Discussion and Analysis serves as an introduction to RTD’s basic financial statements. RTD’s financial statements are
prepared using proprietary fund (enterprise fund) accounting that uses the same basis of accounting as private-sector business enterprises.
Under this method of accounting, an economic resources measurement focus and an accrual basis of accounting is used. Revenue is recorded
when earned and expenses are recorded when incurred.
The basic financial statements are comprised of four components: statements of net position; statements of revenues, expenses and
changes in net position; statements of cash flows; and notes to the financial statements.
The statements of net position presents information on assets and deferred outflows of resources and liabilities and deferred inflows of
resources, with the difference between the two reported as the net position. Over time, increases or decreases in net position may serve
as a useful indicator of whether the financial position of RTD is improving or deteriorating. The statements of revenues, expenses, and
changes in net position presents information on operating revenues and expenses and non-operating revenues and expenses of RTD for the
fiscal year with the difference, the net income or loss, combined with any capital grants and local contributions to determine the change in
net position for the year. That change combined with the previous year-end total net position reconciles to the net position total at the end
of the current fiscal year. All changes in net position are reported as soon as the underlying event giving rise to the changes occurs,
regardless of the timing of the related cash flows.
The statements of cash flows reports cash and cash equivalent activities for the fiscal year resulting from operating activities, capital, and
related financing activities, noncapital and related financing activities and investing activities. The result of these activities added to the
beginning of the year cash balance reconciles to the cash and cash equivalents balance at the end of the current fiscal year. The statements
of cash flows, along with the related notes and information in other financial statements, can be used to assess the following: RTD’s ability
to generate positive cash flows and pay its debt as the debt matures; the reasons for differences between RTD’s operating cash flows and
operating income (loss); and the effect of investing, capital, and financing activities on RTD’s financial position.
The notes to the financial statements provide additional information that is essential to fully understand the data provided in the statements
of net position, statements of revenues, expenses, and changes in net position, and statements of cash flows.
RTD provides bus, paratransit, and light rail service in a 2,342 square mile area in and around Denver, Colorado. The activities of RTD are
supported by a 0.6% and 0.4% sales and use tax collected within the District. The 0.6% sales and use tax is used to fund the Base System
operations of RTD. The Base System operations provide the bus and the majority of current light rail services in the Denver area. The 0.4%
sales and use tax funds the FasTracks build-out program and operation and maintenance of those program elements as well as providing for
enhanced transit services in the District. Additional revenue sources include fare collections, federal, state, and local financial assistance,
investment income, and other income such as advertising and rental income.
Financial Analysis
Condensed Financial Information - Condensed financial information from the statements of net position and statements of revenues,
expenses, and changes in net position is presented below.
Statements of Net Position – As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, total assets and deferred outflows of resources of RTD exceeded
total liabilities and deferred inflows of resources by $3,413,509 and $3,322,352, respectively. The largest portion of this excess, in 2017
and in 2016, was invested in capital assets, net of related debt. RTD uses these capital assets to provide public transportation services to
customers; consequently, these assets are not available for future spending. Although RTD’s investment in capital assets is reported net of
related debt, it should be noted that funding required to repay this debt will be obtained from other sources such as sales and use tax, since

the capital assets themselves cannot be used to pay the related debt. The amount of unrestricted net position as of December 31, 2017
was $(223,204) compared to $(214,479) in 2016. Substantially all of the unrestricted net position, although not legally restricted, has
been appropriated or reserved by the RTD Board for future capital acquisition and reserve policy requirements, and debt liquidation during
the budget process. The deficit balance in Unrestricted Net Position includes an allowance for a Net Pension Liability of $330,955 in 2017
for the represented employee defined benefit pension plan (see Note I). RTD has recognized this liability in its financial statements in
accordance with GASB Statement 68; however, RTD is current in making all required contributions under the collective bargaining
agreement.

In 2017, capital assets net of accumulated depreciation increased $202,016 (3.1%) for acquisition of revenue equipment, buildings, land,
and construction in progress for the projects in the FasTracks program.
Current liabilities increased $16,940 (7.1%) in 2017 primarily due to higher volume of Ecopass 2018 contracts processed at end of year
resulting in recording of unearned revenue.
Noncurrent liabilities and deferred inflows decreased $43,877 (1.0%) in 2017 primarily due to change in the Net Pension Liability recognition
of deferred resources as require by GASB Statement No. 68, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions, and GASB Statement 71,
Pension Transition for Contributions Made Subsequent to the Measurement Date.
The net position of RTD increased by $91,157 during the current year compared to an increase of $145,414 in the previous year. The
increase in 2017 and 2016 was due to higher operating revenues, sales and use tax collection increases a one-time gain recognized for a
bond refunding, net of increases in operating expenses and non-operating expenses.

Passenger fares – Passenger fares provided 14.2% and 13.4% of total revenues in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Farebox receipts, monthly
and annual pass revenue, and special event fares for bus and rail services are included in passenger fares. Passenger fares increased by
$5,595 (4.2%) in 2017 compared to an increase of $14,092 (11.7%) in 2016. Passenger fares changes in 2017 were minimal. The increase
in 2016 was due to new fare boundaries and pricing, in addition to the launch of the University of Colorado A line commuter rail services.
Advertising and other – Advertising and other revenue provided 0.7% and 0.6% of total revenues in both 2017 and 2016; this includes
revenues from advertisements primarily on RTD’s buses and external wraps on light rail vehicles. Advertising and other income increased
$1,356 (23.4%) in 2017 compared to an increase of $456 (8.5%) in 2016. The increase in 2017 and prior year was due an increase in
advertising revenue related to a stronger economy, new rail lines and revenue for lease and naming rights.
Sales and Use Tax – Sales and use tax provided 60.4% and 56.0% of RTD’s total revenues in 2017 and 2016 respectively. Sales and use
tax is a dedicated 1.0% tax imposed on certain sales within the service area. Sales and use tax increased $34,589 (6.1%) in 2017 compared
to an increase of $22,080 (4.1%) in 2016. In 2017 and 2016, the District experienced growth in tax revenues due to increased consumer
and business-spending activity as the District continues to experience population growth of 1.4% and 1.6%, low unemployment of 2.8%
and 3.3% as well as growth in personal income of 3.8% and 1.9%, respectively.
Grant operating assistance – Grant operating assistance provided 8.1% and 7.7% of total revenues in 2017 and 2016. Grant operating
assistance increased $3,077 (4.0%) in 2017compared to an increase of $3,952 (5.4%) in 2016. The operating assistance is a federal grant
revenue program used to perform capital maintenance and maintain RTD’s revenue fleet of bus, paratransit, and rail vehicles. The increase
in both 2017 and 2016 is the result of grant funding sources being available during the year.
Investment Income – Investment income provided 6.4% and 0.6% of total revenues in 2017and 2016. Investment income increased
$56,659 (889.3%) in 2017 compared to an increase of $3,207 (101.4%) in 2016. The increase in 2017 was due to the gain from
extinguishment of DUSPA Bonds. The increase in 2016 was due to fixed securities getting better yields.
Other Income/Gain on sale of Assets – Other income provided 1.5% and 1.6% of total revenues in 2017 and 2016. Other income
decreased $973 (6.2%) in 2017 compared to an increase of $4,184 (36.7%) in 2016. Other income includes interest subsidy income, rental
income from retail space, parking, and miscellaneous other items. The decrease in 2017 was due to reduction of asset sales, which was
primarily attributable to the sale of three Fort Lupton parcels sold in 2016.

Capital grants and local contributions – Capital grants and local contributions provided 8.7% and 20.1% of total revenues in 2017 and
2016. Capital grants and local contributions decreased $115,840 (57.3%) in 2017 and increased $32,922 (19.4%) in the previous year.
The decrease in 2017 was a result of lower capital contributions related to completion of major construction projects. The increase in 2016
was a result of RTD securing a small starts grant for the Southeast Rail Extension, construction of the Civic Center Station and betterments
for the I-225 corridor.

Salaries and wages–Salary and wage expense is the largest expense category accounting for 19.2% and 19.0% of the total RTD expenses
in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Salary and wage expenses increased by $8,885 (5.4%) in 2017 compared to an increase of $12,842
(8.5%) in 2016. Increases in both years occurred from salary and wage performance (result based) and progression increases, and additional
service provided with the openings of new rail lines.
Benefits – Fringe benefits accounted for 10.2% and 11.2% of total expenses in 2017 and 2016. Fringe benefits decreased by $4,947
(5.1%) in 2017 compared to an increase of $19,990 (26.2%) in 2016. The fluctuations for both 2017 and 2016 is primarily due to
implementation GASB Statement Nos. 68 and 71 establish standards for measuring and recognizing net pension liabilities.
Materials and supplies – The materials and supplies expense category accounted for 5.0% and 6.1% of the total expenses in 2017 and
2016 respectively. Materials and supplies expenses decreased $7,494 (14.4%) in 2017 compared to a decrease of $6,704 (11.4%) in
2016. The decrease in both years is primarily due to a decrease in diesel/gasoline fuel prices.
Services – Services expense accounted for 8.6% and 6.8% of total expenses in 2017 and 2016. Services expense includes contracted
services such as security services; vehicle, equipment and right of way maintenance services; advertising and marketing services, and legal
services. Services expense increased $18,763 (32.0%) in 2017 compared to a decrease of $21,189 (26.6%) in 2016. The increase in 2017
was primarily due to contract services for betterments for North Metro Rail and South East Extension projects. The decrease in 2016 was
primarily due to the contract service deduction for Westminster Station IGA and U.S. 36 managed lane project (Phase I).
Utilities – Utilities accounted for 1.8% and 1.7% of total expenses in 2017 and 2016. Utilities expense includes electric,
telecommunications, water and sewer, and natural gas for facilities. Utilities expense increased $2,283 (16.1%) in 2017 compared to an
increase of $547 (4.0%) in 2016. The increase in 2017 and 2016 occurred primarily due to traction power costs due to the opening of the
University of Colorado A line and the B Line commuter rail.
Insurance – Insurance accounted for 1.5% and 1.2% of total expenses in 2017 and 2016. Insurance expense includes RTD’s self-insured
cost for general liability and worker’s compensation claims. In addition, RTD purchased insurance in its efforts to protect assets. Insurance
expense increased $2,937 (28.3%) in 2017 compared to an increase of $2,280 (28.1%) in 2016. The increase in both years 2017 and
2016 was due increased frequency and severity of claims.

Purchased transportation – The purchased transportation expense category accounted for 17.7% and 18.2% of the total expenses in
2017 and 2016. Purchased transportation represents the costs of contracted transportation services for bus, commuter rail, access-a-Ride,
and call-n-Ride services. Purchased transportation costs increased $2,446 (1.6%) in 2017 compared to an increase of $43,389 (38.3%) in
2016. The increase was primarily due to the opening of the University of Colorado A Line and B Line commuter rail purchased transportation
service in 2016.
Leases and rentals – Leases and rentals include lease expense for office space, office equipment, park-n-Ride facilities, and use of
communication towers. Leases and rentals expense decreased $459 (14.0%) in 2017 compared to a decrease of $174 (5.0%) in 2016. The
decrease in 2017 was primarily due to RTD’s need for reduction of office space due to completion of EagleP3 project. The decrease for
2016 was primarily due to reduction in stadium management lease costs.
Miscellaneous – Miscellaneous expense includes other incidental operating expenses not included in other defined categories.
Miscellaneous expenses increased $30 (0.7%) in 2017 compared to a decrease of $348 (7.7%) in 2016. This category includes additional
one-time project expenses creating fluctuations between years.
Depreciation – The depreciation expense category accounted for 27.7% and 25.8% of the total expenses in 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Depreciation expense is a non-cash systematic allocation of the cost of capital assets over the estimated useful life of the assets.
Depreciation expense increased $26,479 (11.9%) in 2017 compared to an increase of $69,623 (45.6%) in 2016. The increase in both 2017
and 2016 occurred primarily due to the FasTracks assets that were placed in revenue service.
Interest expense – The interest expense category accounted for 7.3% and 9.0% of the total expenses in 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Interest expense decreased $11,926 (15.4%) in 2017 compared to a decrease of $2,414 (3.0%) in 2016. The decrease in 2017 interest
expense is due to partial refunding of Sale Tax Bonds, Certificates of Participation and partial extinguishment and refunding of DUSPA
bonds. The decrease in 2016 is due to reduced principal resulting in decrease in interest expense.
Other expense – Other expense includes miscellaneous non-operating expenses not classified in other expense categories. Other expense
increased $1,723 (137.0%) in 2017 compared to a decrease of $164 (11.5%) in 2016. The increase in 2017 was primarily due to issuance
costs for 2017A/2017B Sales Tax FasTracks Revenue Bonds. The decrease in 2016 was a result of reduced financial issuance costs.
Capital Assets – Investments in capital assets include: land and rights-of-way; buildings and improvements; leasehold improvements;
revenue and non-revenue vehicles; shop and service equipment; security and surveillance equipment; computer equipment; and furniture.
RTD’s investment in capital assets, net of accumulated depreciation, in 2017 was $6,804,036 compared to $6,602,020 in 2016. The
increase in capital assets in 2017 was $202,106 (3.1%) compared to an increase of $470,412 (7.7%) in 2016. RTD acquires its assets
with sales and use tax revenues, farebox revenue, federal capital grants, and proceeds from the sale of revenue bonds and certificates of
participation. The increases during 2017 and 2016 were primarily due to the cost of planning, design and construction of FasTracks projects
and fleet acquisition.

Major capital asset events during the 2017 fiscal year included the following:
FasTracks North Metro Corridor - The North Metro Corridor is an 18-mile rail transit corridor between Denver Union Station and 162nd
Avenue, passing through Denver, Commerce City, Thornton, Northglenn and unincorporated Adams County. A construction contract was
entered to complete the commuter rail line from DUS north to 124th Avenue by 2018 with an option to extend construction to 162nd Avenue
if additional funding is identified. In 2017, expenditures related to the North Metro Corridor were approximately $121,418.
East and Gold Line Public-Private Partnership (Eagle P3) RTD was selected for inclusion in the FTA Public-Private Partnership Pilot Program (Penta-P). In 2010, RTD entered into a public-private
partnership to design, build, finance, operate and maintain several of the transit improvements contemplated under the FasTracks program.
The Eagle P3 project is a $2,185,000 project that includes a Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility, the East and Gold Line Corridors as well
as the Northwest Rail Electrified Segment. The Eagle P3 partnership was awarded to a concessionaire, Denver Transit Partners (DTP),
through a competitive bid process culminating in a contract price that was $305,000 below internal estimates. The project is expected to
be fully in revenue service in 2018.
The Eagle P3 project will be completed in two phases. Phase I includes the East Corridor, Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility and design
work for Phase II. Phase II includes the Gold Line Corridor and the Northwest Electrified Rail Segment. The Eagle P3 Project elements are
described below:
FasTracks East Corridor - The East Corridor is a 23.6-mile commuter rail transit corridor between Denver Union Station and Denver
International Airport. The East Corridor opened for revenue service in April 2016.
FasTracks Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility - The Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility is designed to service the four planned
commuter rail corridors (East Corridor, Gold Line, North Metro, and Northwest Rail) included in the FasTracks plan. The Facility opened
in 2015.

FasTracks Gold Line Corridor - The Gold Line Corridor is an 11.2-mile rail transit corridor between Denver Union Station to the vicinity
of Ward Road, passing through northwest Denver, unincorporated Adams County, Arvada, and Wheat Ridge. The Gold Line is planned
to be open for revenue service in 2018.
FasTracks Northwest Electrified Rail Segment – The Northwest Rail Corridor, described previously, includes a project segment,
referred to as the Northwest Electrified Rail Segment, extending from Denver Union Station to Westminster. This segment opened for
revenue service in Summer 2016.
FasTracks I-225 Rail Line – The I-225 Rail Line is a 10.5-mile extension of RTD’s existing light rail line from the Southeast Line Nine Mile
Station to the East Line commuter rail transfer point near the intersection of Peoria Street and Smith Road. The project includes eight
stations and serves the Aurora City Center and the Anschutz/Fitzsimons Medical Campus. This line opened for revenue service in February
2017. In 2017, expenditures related to the I-225 Rail Line were $12,158.
FasTracks Southeast Rail Extension – The Southeast Rail Extension extends the popular Southeast Rail Line from Lincoln Station to the
new RidgeGate Parkway Interchange at I-25. The project will add 2.3 miles of light rail. New stations will be built at Sky Ridge Medical
Center, Lone Tree City Center and RidgeGate with a 1,300 space Park-n-Ride facility. In 2017, expenditures related to the Southeast Rail
Extension were $76,635. The project is expected to open for revenue service in 2019.
Additional information on RTD’s capital assets can be found in footnote D of this report.
Debt Administration
Outstanding debt – Outstanding debt includes sales tax revenue bond, a Transportation Infrastructure and Innovation Act (TIFIA) loan,
certificates of participation, and a Purchase and Assignment Agreement. The 2017 outstanding debt was $3,521,291 compared to
$3,614,608 in 2016. Outstanding debt decreased by $93,317 (2.6%) in 2017 and increased by $165,289 (4.8%) in 2016. The decrease in
2017 is primarily due to refunding and extinguishment of DUSPA Bonds. The increase in 2016 was due to issuance of a 2016A FasTracks
Sales Tax Revenue Bond.
Sales tax revenue bonds – RTD issues sales tax revenue bonds to fund the acquisition and construction of assets. The sales tax
revenue bonds were $2,088,744 and $2,190,533 as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The sales tax revenue bonds
decreased $101,789 (4.6%) in 2017 compared to an increase of $177,313 (8.8%) in 2016. The decrease in 2017 is primarily due to
refunding of DUSPA bonds. The increase in 2016 is primarily due to issuance of the 2016A FasTracks Sales Tax Revenue Bond. The
sales tax revenue bonds are payable from RTD’s sales and use tax revenue. RTD is required to maintain certain minimum deposits, as
defined in bond resolutions, to meet debt service requirements. The bonds may be redeemed prior to maturity, at a price equal to the
principal amount plus accrued interest thereon and a premium to the date of redemption.
Certificates of participation - Certificates of participation relate to financial obligations issued by the Asset Acquisition Authority, Inc.
(Authority), a nonprofit corporation. The Authority issued Certificates of Participation (Certificates) with the proceeds being used to
acquire certain equipment and facilities to be used by RTD. RTD leases the equipment acquired with the proceeds from the Certificates
under separate Master Lease Purchase Agreements. For financial reporting purposes, RTD accounts for the Certificates as its own
debt. Certificates outstanding were $1,176,397 and $1,199,275 as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Certificates
outstanding decreased $22,878 (1.9%) in 2017 compared to a decrease of $31,585 (2.6%) in 2016. The decrease in 2017 and 2016 is
due to principal payment reducing debt.

Economic Factors and Subsequent Events after adoption of the 2017 Budget
RTD is dependent on sales and use taxes, which are the largest single source of revenue for RTD, representing 60.4% and 56.0% of the
total revenues in 2017 and 2016 respectively. Sales and use tax revenues are affected by the local economy in which changes will affect
the level of funding available to RTD during its fiscal year.
RTD is dependent on passenger fares collected for transit services provided. Passenger fares accounted for 14.2% and 13.4% of total
revenues in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Passenger fare collections may be affected by fare levels charged by RTD. In January 2016,
RTD implemented a fare increase and modification to fare products offered to customers.
RTD is dependent on federal and local grant funding as well as local capital contributions for both operations and capital
expenditures. Grants and local contributions provided 16.8% and 27.8% of total revenues in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Grant funding
and local capital contributions are only available for use by RTD for qualifying expenditures after appropriation is made by the awarding
agency.
Each year, RTD proposes an Amended Budget at mid-year to the Board of Directors for appropriation in order to adjust revenue and
expenditures for the remainder of the fiscal year according to existing economic conditions and fiscal results. RTD may also present budget
amendments to the Board of Directors for approval at any time during the fiscal year to accommodate economic factors.

In June 2017, the Board of Directors approved the 2017 Amended Budget in which revenue was adjusted downward to reflect economic
conditions and results and certain adjustments to appropriated expenditures were made to accommodate the expected lower funding
availability.
RTD is in various phases of construction and testing on the Southeast Rail Extension (SERE), the North Metro rail line and the Gold Line.
Each of these FasTracks projects is expected to open for revenue service during the next few years. Additional funding for other capital
projects within the FasTracks project scope have been deferred due to a lack of funding.
Requests for Information
This financial report is intended to provide an overview of RTD’s finances for those with an interest in this organization. Questions
concerning any information contained in this report may be directed to the Chief Financial Officer.

Packet Pg. 125

11.A.a

1. Organization
The Regional Transportation District (RTD) was created as a transportation planning agency, a political subdivision of
the State of Colorado, by an Act of the Colorado General Assembly (the Act), effective July 1969 (Title 32, Article 9,
C.R.S., 1973, as amended). In 1974, the Act was amended and RTD became an operating entity charged with the
responsibility for development, operation and maintenance of a public mass transportation system for the benefit of
the citizens of the District. The District is comprised of 15 separate districts located in Denver, Boulder, Broomfield
and Jefferson counties, and certain portions of Adams, Arapahoe, Douglas, and Weld counties.
RTD is governed by a publicly elected board of directors consisting of 15 members. Each board member is elected to
serve a term of four years by the constituents of the district in which the board member resides. As required by Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), these financial statements present RTD and its component unit. The
component unit discussed in note A.2 is included in the RTD’s reporting entity because of the significance of its
operational or financial relationship with the District.
In 1988, a Senate Bill was enacted (privatization legislation) requiring RTD to implement by March 31, 1989, a plan to
competitively bid contracts for the provision of at least 20% of RTD’s bus service by private contractors. In 1999, the
Bill was amended requiring RTD to increase this provision to at least 35% of fixed route bus service. In 2003, the Bill
was amended to require that at least 50% of RTD’s vehicular service be operated by private transit companies. In May
of 2007, the legislation was amended to provide for “a system under which up to 58% of the District’s service” is
provided by private contractors.
2. Financial Reporting Entity – Blended Component Unit
The Asset Acquisition Authority, Inc. (the Authority) was formed in 1987 as a nonprofit corporation on behalf of RTD
for the purpose of issuing certificates of participation in a public offering collateralized by an installment purchase
agreement with RTD. RTD’s General Manager appoints the Board of Directors of the Authority. The Authority serves
as a financing mechanism for various financing arrangements for RTD. RTD follows pronouncements 14 and 61 issued
by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board which provides guidance regarding the inclusion of component units
in the primary government’s financial statement presentation. The activity related to the underlying financial obligations
of the Authority has been included as a blended component unit in RTD’s financial statements for the years ended
December 31, 2017 and 2016. No separately audited financial statements are prepared for the Authority.
3. Basis of Accounting
The accounts of RTD are reported as a Proprietary Fund. Proprietary funds are accounted for on the flow of economic
resources measurement focus and use the accrual basis of accounting which reports all assets, deferred outflows of
resources, liabilities, deferred inflows of resources, revenues, expenses, gains and losses. Revenue is recognized when
earned and expenses are recorded at the time liabilities are incurred. Proprietary funds distinguish operating revenues
and expenses from non-operating items. Operating revenues and expenses generally result from providing services and
producing and delivering goods in connection with a proprietary fund’s principal ongoing operations. The principal
operating revenues of RTD are charges to customers for services. Operating expenses include the cost of services,
administrative expenses and asset depreciation. All revenues and expenses not meeting this definition are reported as
non-operating revenues and expenses.
It is RTD’s policy to apply GAAP in its presentation of financial statements. When both restricted and unrestricted
resources are available for use, it is RTD’s policy to use restricted resources first, then unrestricted resources as they
are needed.

NOTE A – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Packet Pg. 126

11.A.a

RTD considers all highly liquid investments, both restricted and unrestricted, with an original maturity of three months
or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
5. Interest Bearing Investments
Investments with a maturity date, when purchased, of less than one year are carried at cost or amortized cost which
approximates fair value. Investments with a maturity date of more than one year from the date of purchase are carried
at fair value.
6. Inventories
Inventories consist primarily of materials and supplies used in the ordinary course of operations. Materials and supplies
are stated at cost using the FIFO (first-in, first-out) method.
7. Other Current Assets
Certain payments to vendors reflect costs applicable to future accounting periods and are recorded as prepaid items.
Escrows are deposits held in escrow during the period of construction. At the time projects are completed, escrows
are generally applied toward the cost of the project or may be forfeited by RTD upon breach of contract.
8. Receivables
Accounts receivable are stated at the amount management expects to collect from outstanding balances. Management
provides for probable uncollected amounts through a charge to earnings and a credit to a valuation allowance based on
its assessment of the current status of individual accounts. Balances that are still outstanding after management has
used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the valuation allowance and a credit to accounts
receivable. Changes in the valuation allowance have not been material to the consolidated financial statements.
9. Restricted Assets
Restricted assets are assets restricted by the covenants of long-term financial arrangements.
10. Capital Assets
Property and equipment are stated at historical cost. Capital assets are defined by RTD as assets with an initial,
individual cost of more than $5,000 and an estimated useful life in excess of one year. Maintenance and repairs are
charged to current period operating expenses and improvements are capitalized. Upon retirement or other disposition
of property and equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts
and any gains or losses are included in non-operating revenue and expense. A pro rata share of proceeds from the sale
of property and equipment, which were acquired with federal funds, is required to be invested in a similar asset.
Interest is capitalized on assets financed with debt or certificates of participation from the date of the borrowing until
completion of the project. The amount of tax-exempt and taxable debt and certificates of participation (externally
restricted) interest to be capitalized is the difference between the interest expense and interest earnings on issuance
proceeds. The amount of other interest to be capitalized is calculated by weighted average construction expenditures
multiplied by the weighted average interest rate of the outstanding obligations.

11. Depreciation
Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of
the assets, which are as follows:
Land improvements
Buildings
Revenue earning equipment
Shop, maintenance and other equipment

10–20 years
30 years
8–25 years
3–10 years

Fully depreciated assets, which are still in use, are included in the asset balances in the accompanying financial
statements. The cost of fully depreciated assets was approximately $350,394 and $336,323 at December 31, 2017
and 2016, respectively.
12. Deferred Outflows/Inflows of Resources
In addition to assets, the statement of financial position will sometimes report a separate section for deferred outflow
of resources. This separate financial statement element, deferred outflows of resources, represents a consumption of
net position that applies to a future period(s) and thus, will not be recognized as an outflow of resources
(expense/expenditure) until then. RTD’s deferred outflows were $95,038 and $107,526 as of December 31, 2017 and
2016, respectively.
In addition to liabilities, the statement of financial position will sometimes report a separate section for deferred inflows
of resources. This separate financial statement element, deferred inflows of resources, represents an acquisition of net
position that applies to a future period(s) and so will not be recognized as an inflow of resources (revenue) until that
time. RTD’s deferred inflows were $19,302 and $5,764 as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
13. Compensated Absences
RTD employees receive compensation for vacations, holidays, illness, and certain other qualifying absences. The
number of days compensated in the various categories of absence is based generally on length of service. Compensated
absences, which have been earned but not paid, have been accrued in the accompanying financial statements.
14. Self-Insurance
Liabilities for property damage and personal injury are recognized as incurred on the basis of the estimated cost to RTD.
In addition, RTD offers a self-insured health benefit option as part of its employee benefits program in which costs are
recognized as they are incurred.

Attachment: RTD 2017 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (05-2018) (3480 : 2017 CAFR and Report to Governance)

Total interest cost of RTD consisted of the following as of December 31:

Packet Pg. 128

11.A.a

Passenger Fares
Passenger fares are recorded as revenue at the time services are performed and revenue is collected from the farebox.
Sales of monthly passes are recorded initially as unearned revenue and recognized as income at the end of the month
for which the pass is used. Sale of MyRide stored value, Mobile ticketing, ten ride and day pass tickets are recorded
as income at the time of sale. Sales of college based passes, which are valid for a specific academic semester, are
recorded initially as unearned revenue. Sales are recognized as income at the end of each month, with the amount
recognized in each month determined by prorating the total contract amount over the semesters/quarters covered. Sales
of Eco Pass and Neighborhood Pass, which are valid through December 31 of a given year, are recorded initially as
unearned revenue. Sales are recognized as income at the end of each month, with the total contract amount prorated
evenly over the number of months of the contract.
Sales and Use Taxes
Under the provisions of the Act, as amended, RTD levies a sales tax of 1.0% on net taxable sales made within the
District and a use tax of 1.0% on items purchased for use inside the District. As described in Note D, under the terms
of the Sales Tax Revenue Bonds, Series 2007A, Series 2010A, Series 2010B, Series 2012A, Series 2013A, 2016A,
2017A and 2017 B bond resolutions, and TIFIA Sales Tax Loan and Series 2016A, sales and use tax revenue is pledged
for payment of debt service. Sales and use taxes are collected by the State of Colorado, Department of Revenue and
are remitted to a trustee who satisfies debt service from the collections, as required under RTD’s bond and commercial
paper resolutions, and remits the balance to RTD.
Sales and use taxes are recorded as revenue by RTD in the month collected by the merchant. Sales and Use Tax Bonds
debt service will be paid from the collateralized sales and use tax revenues in the amount of approximately $3,962,030
through 2050. Principal and interest paid for the current year and pledged revenues received were $108,393.
Grants and Local Contributions
RTD receives grants from the federal government, through the Federal Transit Administration (FTA). Grants are also
awarded to RTD by state of Colorado through the Colorado Department of Transportation. The federal and state
governments issue grants to RTD for operations and acquisition of property and equipment.
The amount recorded as capital grant revenue was $75,500 and $185,324 in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Operating
assistance grant revenue was $80,412 and $77,335 in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Other contribution revenue was
$10,895 and $16,911 in 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Grants and local contributions are recorded as revenue by RTD once all applicable eligibility requirements are met.
16. Use of Estimates
The financial statements contained herein have been prepared in accordance with US Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles (GAAP). GAAP are uniform minimum standards of and guidelines to financial accounting and reporting. GAAP
establishes appropriate measurement and classification criteria for financial reporting. Adherence to GAAP provides a
reasonable degree of comparability among the financial reports of state and local governmental units. The preparation
of financial statements in accordance with GAAP involves the use of management’s estimates. These estimates are
based upon management’s best judgments, after considering past and current events and assumptions about future
events. Actual results may differ from estimates.

Packet Pg. 129

11.A.a

For purposes of measuring the net pension liability, deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of resources
related to pensions, and pension expense, information about the pension plan’s fiduciary net position and additions
to/deductions from the plan’s fiduciary net position have been determined on the same basis as they are reported by
the plan. For this purpose, benefit payments (including refunds of employee contributions) are recognized when due and
payable in accordance with the benefit terms. Investments are reported at fair value.
18. TABOR (Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights) – Reserve Composition
Restricted net position represents amounts constrained by external parties or legislation. In 1992, Colorado voters
approved an amendment to the state constitution referred to as the TABOR (Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights) Amendment in
which certain annual limitations were placed on the growth of government revenues. The Amendment also requires
that an Emergency Reserve, referred to as Restricted TABOR, of 3.0% of fiscal year spending excluding debt service
be maintained for all years subsequent to 1994 for declared emergencies. The Amendment does not specify the
asset composition of the Restricted TABOR reserve. In 2016, RTD’s Restricted TABOR reserves were comprised

Deposits
RTD’s deposits are subject to the State of Colorado’s Public Deposit Protection Act (PDPA). Under this act, all uninsured
public deposits at qualified institutions are fully collateralized with pledged collateral which is held in custody by any Federal
Reserve Bank or branch thereof, or held in escrow by some other bank in a manner as the banking Commissioner shall
prescribe by rule and regulation, or may be segregated from the other assets of the eligible public depository and held in its
own trust department. Colorado’s PDPA requires that pledged collateral to be held is clearly identified as being security
maintained or pledged for the aggregate amount of public deposits accepted and held on deposit by the eligible public
depository. The depository has the right at any time to make substitutions of eligible collateral maintained or pledged and is
at all times entitled to collect and retain all income derived from those investments without restrictions.
As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, RTD had bank deposits of $5,191 and $46,919 collateralized with
securities held by the pledging financial institutions’ trust department or agent but not in RTD’s name.

Concentration of Credit Risk, it is the policy of RTD to diversify its investment portfolio. Assets held in the investment
funds shall be diversified to eliminate the risk of loss resulting from over-concentration of assets in a specific maturity, a
specific issue or a specific class of securities. The asset allocation in the portfolio should, however, be flexible, depending
upon the outlook for the economy and the securities markets.
RTD’s investment policy outlines the following maximum exposure limits for unrestricted investments. As of December
31, 2017, RTD was in compliance with these limits. More than 5.00% of the District’s unrestricted investments in U.S.
agency securities are in individual issuers: Federal National Mortgage Association (5.27%), Federal Home Loan Bank

In the event that one or more nationally recognized statistical rating agency rates such Agency obligations below the highest rating category, but no
lower than one of the two highest rating categories, RTD’s funds may continue to be invested in Agencies if such investments satisfy the requirements
of CRS 24.75.601.1 (m) which limits the maturity from the date of settlement to three years, provided that the book value limits of CRS 24.75.601.1
(m) (II) shall not apply. Rather, the diversification limit shall be set as follows: no more than 75% of the portfolio may be invested in Agencies, with any
more than 25% being invested in any one Agency.

Proceeds from the issuance of RTD’s obligations are invested in accordance with legal documentation governing the
transaction, notwithstanding any provisions of RTD’s investment policy to the contrary, and do not fall within the maximum
exposure limits listed above.
At December 31, 2017 and 2016, RTD had $396,604 and $607,668 of cash and investments that were restricted under the
provisions of bond agreements.
Fair Value Measurements
In March 2015, the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) released Statement No. 72, Fair Value Measurement
and Application, which would generally require state and local governments to measure investments at fair value. GASB's
goal is enhance comparability of governmental financial statements by requiring fair value measurement for certain assets
and liabilities using a consistent definition and accepted valuation techniques. This standard expands fair value disclosures
to provide comprehensive information for financial statement users about the impact of fair value measurements on a
government's financial position.
Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in an active market for identical assets or liabilities that the District has the ability to
access at the measurement date. Examples derived from NYSE, NASDAQ, Chicage Board of Trade, Pink Sheets.
Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices under Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly
on the measurement date. Examples include Matrix pricing, market corroborated pricing; inputs such as yield curves and
indices.

Attachment: RTD 2017 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (05-2018) (3480 : 2017 CAFR and Report to Governance)

11.A.a

Level 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability used to measure fair value that rely on the reporting entity's reasonably
available information concerning the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability, including
assumptions about risk. Examples include investment Manager Pricing for Private Placement, Private Equities, and Hedge
Funds.

ten years. The benefit amount is based on final average earnings, years of employment under this Plan and age at date of
retirement.

• The maximum service included in the benefit calculation is reduced from 30 years to 25 years. (Priority 3).

Projected benefit payments are required to be discounted to their actuarial present values using a Single Discount Rate that
reflects (1) a long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments (to the extent that the plan’s fiduciary net position
is projected to be sufficient to pay benefits) and (2) tax-exempt municipal bond rate based on an index of 20-year general

obligation bonds with an average AA credit rating as of the measurement date (to the extent that the plan’s projected fiduciary
net position is not sufficient to pay benefits).
For the purpose of this valuation, the expected rate of return on pension plan investments is 7.00%; the municipal bond rate
is 3.78% (based on the daily rate closest to but not later than the measurement date of the Fidelity “20-Year Municipal GO AA

Plan Description
The Regional Transportation District and Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1001 Pension Plan was established pursuant to
collective bargaining agreements between RTD and the Union. This plan covers substantially all full-time union-represented
employees in accordance with the union agreement. The plan is a single-employer defined benefit pension plan administered by
Compusys, Inc.
Benefits Provided
All benefits are paid in the form of a 50% joint and survivor annuity unless this form is rejected by the participant and the
spouse.
Normal retirement benefits under the Plan are paid to participants who have attained age 65 and have been with the Plan for
ten years. The benefit amount is based on final average earnings, years of employment under this Plan and age at date of
retirement.
Early retirement, effective January 1, 1992, any Participant who has accumulated 20 or more years of credited service and
terminated employment prior to attaining age 50, will be entitled to an early retirement benefit starting on the first day of any
month after he has attained age 50. The Plan was amended effective January 1, 2011. The years of credited service needed
to qualify for a normal retirement benefit was increased from five to ten years and the benefit multiplier for both the normal
and early retirement was revised.
Death benefits state if an employee, who is not eligible for a vested benefit or not eligible to retire, should die, his beneficiary
will be paid the accumulated employee contributions plus interest. Upon the death of a pensioner, a funeral benefit of $2,000
will be paid in a lump sum to the pensioners designated beneficiary.
Disability benefits, an individual who becomes totally disabled prior to age 65 and retires from active employment with RTD
as a direct result of being totally disabled is entitled to a disability retirement benefit provided he or she has worked for at
least ten years for RTD in covered employment or any of its predecessors. An individual will be considered totally disabled
upon receipt of a disability award from Social Security. Effective January 1, 2011 the years of credited service needed to
qualify for a disability benefit was increased from five to ten years and the benefit multiplier was revised.
Deferred Vested Retirement Benefit, an individual who terminated employment on or after January 1, 1993, for any reason
other than retirement, will be entitled to a deferred vested benefit at age 65 provided he or she had worked for at least ten
years in covered employment for RTD or any of its predecessors. A participant is entitled to deferred, vested benefits as early
as age 50 if he or she has worked for at least 20 years in covered employment and terminates active employment on or after
attaining age 50. If an individual with 20 or more years of service terminated employment prior to age 50, benefits will be
payable at any time after age 50. Effective January 1, 2011 the years of credited service needed to qualify for a deferred
vested retirement disability benefit was increased from five to ten years and the benefit multiplier was revised.
Benefit structure for participants hired on or after January 1, 2011. The following changes are included:
•
•
•
•
•

The benefit multiplier is changed from 2.5% to 1% with a new benefit schedule. (Priority 1).
Regular retirement is changed from age 55 with 20 years of service to age 60 with 20 years of service.
Sick and vacation payouts are no longer included in the pension benefit calculation. (Priority 2).
Vesting is changed from 5 years to 10 years.
Interest on employee contributions is changed from 5% to 3%.

A “Trigger Policy” has also been provided that will partially rescind the modified benefit structure when certain Plan funding
benchmarks are achieved. If the total Actuarial Required Contribution (ARC) is less than 11% of payroll, pension benefits would
be restored in the order of priority listed above. The "Trigger" remains in effect until such time as the 11% ARC is restored.

• The maximum service included in the benefit calculation is reduced from 30 years to 25 years. (Priority 3).

Projected benefit payments are required to be discounted to their actuarial present values using a Single Discount Rate that
reflects (1) a long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments (to the extent that the plan’s fiduciary net position
is projected to be sufficient to pay benefits) and (2) tax-exempt municipal bond rate based on an index of 20-year general

obligation bonds with an average AA credit rating as of the measurement date (to the extent that the plan’s projected fiduciary
net position is not sufficient to pay benefits).
For the purpose of this valuation, the expected rate of return on pension plan investments is 7.00%; the municipal bond rate
is 3.57% (based on the weekly rate closest to but not later than the measurement date of the “state & local bonds” rate from
Federal Reserve statistical release (H.15)); and the resulting Single Discount Rate is 4.54%.

Benefit Services, Inc.
Benefits Provided
Normal retirement eligibility age is 65 with five years of credited service; monthly benefit 2.5% of average final compensation
times credited service. Early retirement age is 55 with five years of credited service; monthly benefit if retire or terminate from
active status on or after age 55, the normal retirement benefit is reduced 1/30 for each year less than age 60. If the employee
terminates from active status prior to age 55, the normal retirement benefit is reduced 1/15 for each year between ages 60
and 65, and 1/30 for each year less than age 60.

if death occurs while the participant is actively employed with RTD. The lump sum is the present value of the survivor’s pension
above but determined as if the participant was married and the spouse was the same age as the participant.
Termination eligibility is five years of credited service; monthly benefit if not eligible to retire normal retirement benefit, early
retirement benefit, or if elected within six months, a lump sum equal to the present value of the age 65 accrued benefits,
payable in lieu of all other benefits in the Plan. Employee monthly benefit if eligible to retire normal retirement benefit, early
retirement benefit, or a lump sum equal to the present value of an immediate accrued benefit, payable in lieu of all other
benefits in the Plan.

Credited service is one year for each calendar year of 1,000 hours of service (except years and completed months in the year
of transfer). Credited service applies to vesting and service for retirement benefit eligibility. Average final compensation is
average of participant's highest consecutive 36 months of compensation in the last 120 months of credited service immediately
preceding the calendar month in which retirement occurs. Compensation excludes bonuses, severance pay, long-term disability

Actuarial Assumptions
The total pension liability was determined by an actuarial valuation with date of January 1, 2016, using the following actuarial
assumptions applied to all periods included in the measurement with a liability roll forward to December 31, 2016 for
disclosure purposes for the Fiscal Year Ending December 31, 2017:
Inflation
Salary Increases
Investment Rate of Return

3.00%
4.75% - 9.75%, based on age
7.50%, net of investment expenses

The long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments was determined using a building-block method in
which best- estimate ranges of expected future real rates of return (expected returns, net of pension plan investment expense
and inflation) are developed for each major asset class. These ranges are combined to produce the long-term expected rate
of return by weighting the expected future real rates of return by the target asset allocation percentage including expected
inflation.
Best estimates of arithmetic real rates of return for each major asset class included in the pension plan’s target asset
allocation as of the December 31, 2016 (for disclosure purposes for the Fiscal Year Ending December 31, 2017) are
summarized in the following data and reflect assumed long-term expected real rate of return over a 30-year horizon upon
which the disclosure is based:

RP-2014 Blue Collar Mortality Tables for healthy annuitants, blended 70% male / 30% female for participants and 30% male /

The actuarial assumptions used in the January 1, 2016 valuation were based on the results of an actuarial experience study
covering the period January 1, 2009 – December 31, 2013.
Single Discount Rate
The discount rate used to measure the total pension liability was 7.50%. The projection of cash flows used to determine
the discount rate assumed that RTD contributions would be equal to the actuarially determined contribution rate for the
applicable fiscal years. Based on those assumptions, the pension plan’s fiduciary net position was projected to be available
to make all projected future benefit payments of current plan members. Therefore, the long-term expected rate of return on
pension plan investments was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine the total pension liability.
The discount rate does not incorporate nor require a 20-year tax-exempt general obligation municipal bond rate (with an
average rating of AA/As or higher).
Sensitivity of the Net Pension Liability to Changes in the Discount Rate
The following present the net pension liability of the Plan, calculated using the discount rate of 7.50%, as well as

The actuarial assumptions used in the January 1, 2015 valuation were based on the results of an actuarial experience study
covering the period January 1, 2009 – December 31, 2013.
Single Discount Rate
The discount rate used to measure the total pension liability was 7.50%. The projection of cash flows used to determine
the discount rate assumed that RTD contributions would be equal to the actuarially determined contribution rate for the
applicable fiscal years. Based on those assumptions, the pension plan’s fiduciary net position was projected to be available
to make all projected future benefit payments of current plan members. Therefore, the long-term expected rate of return on
pension plan investments was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine the total pension liability.
The discount rate does not incorporate nor require a 20-year tax-exempt general obligation municipal bond rate (with an
average rating of AA/As or higher).
Sensitivity of the Net Pension Liability to Changes in the Discount Rate
The following present the net pension liability of the Plan, calculated using the discount rate of 7.50%, as well as
what the Plan’s net pension liability would be if it were calculated using a discount rate that is 1-percentage-point
lower (6.50%) or 1-percentage-point higher (8.50%) than the current rate:

Plan Description
The RTD defined contribution plan represents full-time salaried employees hired after January 1, 2008. The RTD Board adopted
amendment No. 8, effective January 1, 2008. RTD contributes 9% of the employee’s qualifying wage. Contributions totaled
$3,981 and $3,478 in 2017 and 2016, respectively. RTD employees cannot contribute to the Plan. Membership was 596 and
520 active employees in 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Amalgamated Transit Union Division 1001 Health and Welfare Trust
The Amalgamated Transit Union Division 1001 Health and Welfare Trust was formed pursuant to a Trust Agreement effective
July 1, 1971, between Amalgamated Transit Union Division 1001 (ATU 1001) and an agent of a transit enterprise owned by
the City and County of Denver, through July 3, 1974, and the Regional Transportation District (RTD) thereafter. In addition
to the original Denver Metro Division, employees of other RTD divisions have been approved for participation in the Trust
benefits. The Trust agreement shall continue in full force and effect in all its terms and provisions so long as there continues
to be a collective bargaining agreement between the Union and RTD.
The Trust provides health benefits (hospital, medical, dental, vision, life and short-term disability) for represented employees
of RTD and certain officers of ATU 1001 and health care benefits for retired employees actively working 600 hours or more
per quarter. The Trust is funded through contribution by the employer and employee, the share of benefit plan contributions is
set by the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA). RTD’s contribution was $19,065 and $19,025 the years ended
December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Trust also provides insurance coverage for felonious assault for each
employee and funds the Amalgamated Transit Union Division 1001 Legal Services Trust. The Trust self-insures part of its
health benefits, life insurance coverage and short-term disability. The plan issues audited financial statements, which include
financial information for the plan. The financial statements may be obtained from the plan: RTD ATU 1001 Health and Welfare
Trust, 2821 S. Parker Road, Suite 215 Aurora, Colorado 80014-2602.
Unearned Compensation Plan
RTD offers its employees an unearned compensation plan (the Plan), created in accordance with Internal Revenue Code
Section 457, which is available to substantially all employees and permits them to defer a portion of their compensation to
future years. Under the terms of the Plan, the unearned compensation is available to participants upon termination, retirement,
death or in the event of an unforeseeable emergency or other financial hardship.
Compensated Absences
RTD considers all accrued compensated absences as due within one year. Employees accrue paid time off (PTO), vacation, and
sick leave based on time in service; employees are not allowed to accumulate more than twice their annual PTO or vacation
accrual and sick leave based on years of service. Employees are paid any outstanding compensated absence balances upon
leaving RTD. RTD records these accrued compensated absences as current liabilities under the principle of conservatism by
assuming these amounts are the most RTD would be obligated to pay in the near-term.

Union Station Alliance (USA) Lease
In December 2012, RTD entered a contract with Union Station Alliance (USA) to renovate and lease RTD’s historic Denver
Union Station Building. The renovation by USA included a hotel, Amtrak facilities, office space, retail and restaurant services
as well as renovation of the Great Train Hall. The renovations were complete and open to the public in July 2014. The
agreement includes a 60-year lease to USA to operate and maintain the facility in which RTD will participate in certain revenue
collections.

Operating Lease – Civic Center Transfer Facility
In 1976, RTD entered into an operating lease for a portion of the land on which the Civic Center transfer facility is located in
downtown Denver. As collateral for the lease, RTD must maintain an account balance with a minimum market value of $1,500 in
an escrow account, the interest on which accrues to RTD until the lease expires. This amount in escrow is included in restricted
assets in the accompanying financial statements.

RTD has entered into a number of transactions in which certain of its light rail vehicles have been leased to and subleased
back from certain U.S. and foreign companies and has entered into a transaction in which its maintenance facilities have been
leased to and subleased back. As part of these transactions, RTD irrevocably set aside certain monies (which were received
from each counter party as payment for its leasing of light rail vehicles and real property) with a third party trustee.
The monies held by such trustees will be utilized to make the lease payments owed by the RTD under the transactions and are
therefore considered fully funded and economically defeased.
Capital Projects
As of December 31, 2017, RTD has contracts for the construction of various capital projects and the purchase of buses and
light rail vehicles. The costs to complete these projects and the purchase of buses/light rail vehicles total $291,887 and
$560,716 in 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Grant Match Requirements
Under the provisions of current grants, RTD is obligated to satisfy certain matching requirements of these grants. At
December 31, 2017, RTD had a commitment to provide $179,032 in matching funds in order to receive $221,624 in future
federal and state grant funds.
Privatization Contracts
In response to the privatization legislation (Note A), RTD has awarded contracts for specific groups of routes, not to exceed
58% as required by law for vehicular services. As of January 2018, slightly over 54.18% of RTD’s non-rail transit services
are delivered by private contractors operating under the auspices and direction of RTD.
ADA Paratransit Service
With the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), RTD was mandated to provide paratransit service to
the disabled individuals unable to use RTD’s fixed route buses, operating the same days and hours of service as the fixed route
service. This service, called Access-a-Ride, is a curb-to-curb (with door-to-door assistance upon special request) transportation
system offered to disabled individuals who cannot functionally use RTD’s regular fixed route system. Passengers eligible for
Access-a-Ride service must originate their trip within 3/4 of a mile of an RTD non-commuter fixed route. Since September
1996, RTD has been in full compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 requirement to provide paratransit
service to the disabled individuals unable to use fixed route buses.
Future Commitments under Construction Contracts
In 2010, RTD entered into a public-private partnership to design, build, finance and operate several of the transit improvements
contemplated under the FasTracks program, including the Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility, the East Rail Corridor, the Gold
Line Rail Corridor and the electrified segment of the Northwest Rail Corridor (together, the “Eagle P3 Project). The Eagle P3
Project is being delivered and operated under a concession agreement that RTD has entered with a concessionaire that has
been selected through a competitive proposal process. The selected concessionaire is known as Denver Transit Partners (DTP),
a special purpose company owned by Fluor Enterprises, Uberior Investments and Laing Investments.
The Eagle P3 Project construction was completed in two phases with Phase I completed in 2016 and Phase II completed in
2018. Under the terms of the Eagle P3 Project agreement, RTD made scheduled construction payments to DTP from 2011
through 2017 for completed project elements. RTD began commuter rail services on the University of Colorado A Line and the
B Line in 2016 with testing and revenue service of the final corridor, the G Line, expected to occur in 2018. RTD will assume
ownership of the entire project once certain contractual criteria and final completion occurs. Under the terms of the

concessionaire agreement, RTD will make scheduled secured principal and interest payments to DTP from 2017 through 2044
in addition to service payments for the provision of operations and maintenance services by DTP. The principal and interest
payments are fixed amounts for the term of the agreement while the service payments are indexed each year according to
certain inflation measurements. In addition, the service payments may also be adjusted for schedule changes, special services
and certain availability factors.
In 2013, RTD entered a contract with Regional Rail Partners to construct the North Metro Rail Line. The North Metro Rail
Line is an 18.5-mile electric commuter rail line that will run from Denver Union Station through Commerce City, Thornton and
Northglenn to Highway 7 at 162nd Avenue in North Adams County. The North Metro Rail Line is expected to open within the
next few years.
In 2014, RTD entered a contract with Balfour Beatty Infrastructure, Inc. to design and construct the Southeast Rail Extension
Project. The Southeast Rail Extension includes 2.3 miles extending of the existing Southeast Light rail Line from Lincoln Station
through the City of Lone Tree to RidgeGate Parkway Station featuring a new Park-n-Ride with a structure of 1,300 parking
spaces. The Southeast Rail Extension is scheduled to open in 2019.

RTD contracts with Mansfield Oil Co of Gainesville, Inc. for diesel fuel. The contract is structured as a single year contract.
The estimated (no locked-in price) commitment under the Mansfield contract in 2018 is $18,900. RTD estimates usage of 9.0
million gallons at unit cost of $2.10 per gallon: 5.2 million gallons of RTD’s usage and 3.8 million gallons of RTD private
carrier’s usage.
Contingencies
Federal Grants
RTD receives federal grants for capital projects and operating assistance, which are subject to audit by FTA. Although the
outcome of any such audit cannot be predicted, it is management’s opinion these audits will not result in liabilities to such an
extent that they would materially affect RTD’s financial position.
Self-Insurance
RTD is self-insured for general liability and Workers’ Compensation claims. Liabilities are reported when it is probable that a
loss has occurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In addition, RTD offers a self-insured health benefit
option as part of its employee benefits program in which costs are recognized as they are incurred.
RTD does not carry excess liability insurance for personal injury and property damage. Under the provisions of the Colorado
Government Immunity Act, the maximum liability, with certain exceptions as defined in the Act, to RTD for claims involving
personal injury and property damage is $350 per individual and $990 per incident.
For Workers’ Compensation, an excess coverage insurance policy covers individual claims in excess of $2,000. The amount
of settlements has not exceeded insurance coverage in any of the past three years.
RTD’s liability for unpaid claims includes an amount for claims that have been incurred but not reported (IBNR). RTD’s Risk
Management determines incurred claims by investigating the accident and establishing a reserve. Reserves are established on
the day of assignment, reviewed at 30 days and again at 90 days. Reserves are reviewed every 90 days thereafter and based
on ultimate exposure. This amount is included in other accrued expenses in the statement of net assets. Changes in the
balances of claims liabilities for both general liability and Worker’s Compensation during the past year are as follows:

RTD is party to a number of pending or threatened tort lawsuits, workers’ compensation claims, or labor/employment claims
under which it may be required to pay certain amounts upon final disposition of these matters. RTD also has certain contract
disputes being considered in contractual dispute resolution proceedings. RTD’s legal counsel estimates that the ultimate
outcome of these matters is sufficiently covered by RTD’s general liability or workers’ compensation reserves, project
contingencies, or insurance, or would not otherwise materially affect the financial statements of RTD.
RTD’s prime contractor for the North Metro Line has asserted claims primarily seeking compensation for delays on the
project. These claims are scheduled for arbitration in late 2018 and are estimated to be up to $70,000. RTD is contesting
these claims and believes it is likely to prevail.
RTD’s concessionaire has asserted a series of change in law and force majeure claims which, if successful, could entitle the
Concessionaire to monetary relief estimated to be up to $70,000. RTD is contesting these claims and believes it is likely to
prevail.

RTD’s annual budget is prepared on the same basis as that used for accounting except that the budget also includes proceeds
of long-term debt and capital grants as revenue and expenditures include capital outlays and bond principal payments, and
excludes TABOR rebates under Amendment One, extraordinary loss and depreciation on, as well as gains and losses on
disposition of, property and equipment. The budget sets forth all proposed outlays for operations, planning, administration,
development, debt service, and capital outlays for the fiscal year. Prior to October 15, the General Manager submits to the
Board of Directors a proposed operating and capital budget for the fiscal year commencing the following January 1, which is
made available for public inspection and comment. On or before December 31, the budget is adopted in conjunction with an
appropriation resolution by the Board of Directors, who must also approve subsequent amendments thereto. In the absence
of such adoption, RTD has authority to begin making expenditures limited to 90% of the prior year’s approved appropriation.
RTD’s policy on budget transfers authorizes the General Manager to approve certain transfers within the budget.

In November 1992, Colorado voters passed an amendment (Amendment 1) to the State Constitution (Article X, Section 20)
that limits the revenue raising and spending abilities of state and local governments known as the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights
(TABOR). The limits on property taxes, revenue, and “fiscal year spending” include allowable annual increases tied to inflation
and local growth in construction valuation. Fiscal year spending as defined by the amendment excludes spending from certain
revenue and financing sources such as federal funds, gifts, property sales, fund transfers, damage awards, and fund reserves
(balances). The amendment requires voter approval for any increase in mill levy tax rates, new taxes, or creation of multi-year
debt. Revenue earned in excess of the “spending limit” must be refunded to the taxpayers unless voters approve retention of
these revenues. In addition, the amendment mandates that reserves equal 3% of fiscal spending be established for declared
emergencies.
On November 7, 1995, the voters of the District exempted the Regional Transportation District from the revenue and spending
limitations concerning the Amendment through December 31, 2005. On November 2, 1999, the voters of the District further
exempted RTD from the revenue and spending limitations outlined in the Amendment for the purpose of paying any debt
incurred to finance the Southeast Corridor light rail project or to operate such project for as long as any debt remains
outstanding, but in no event beyond December 31, 2026.
On November 2, 2004, the voters of the District authorized an increase in RTD’s sales and use tax rate from 0.6% to 1.0%,
effective January 1, 2005, to finance the FasTracks transit improvement program. This authorization also exempted RTD
from any revenue and spending limitations on the additional tax and on any investment income generated by the increased tax
revenue, and allowed RTD to incur debt to finance the capital improvements included in the FasTracks program. At the time
that all FasTracks debt is repaid, RTD’s sales and use tax rate will be reduced to a rate sufficient to operate the rapid transit
system financed through FasTracks. RTD has $3.477 billion in authorized debt, subject to the Amendments’ limitations. This
debt was authorized by the voters of the District in 2004 to pay for the FasTracks rapid transit improvement program. Based
on estimated fiscal year spending for 2017, $25,735 interpretation. RTD believes it is in compliance with the requirements
of the Amendment based on the interpretations of the Amendment’s language available at year-end.
NOTE L – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
On February 28, 2018, the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) between RTD and the Amalgamated Transit Union Local
1001 (ATU) expired. RTD has a single CBA that primarily covers operations and support staff as well as some administrative
positions. Contract negotiations between RTD and ATU for a contract renewal began early in the fourth quarter of 2017. On
March 27, 2018, a new three-year CBA was ratified to be effective March 1, 2018 through February 28, 2021.
On January 1, 2018 Risk Management self-insured liability limits increased. The limits which are $387 per person and $1,093
per occurrence as specified under the Colorado Governmental Immunity statue.
RTD’s concessionaire-provided commuter rail services on the East Corridor (University of Colorado A Line) and the Northwest
Electrified Rail Segment (B Line) are operating under a five year waiver granted by the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA).
The waiver was granted to allow these revenue service operations to continue as specific grade level crossing gate timing
issues are addressed. In addition to the FRA, The Colorado Public Utilities Commission (PUC) also exercises regulatory
authority of commuter rail services and is in agreement with the provisions of the FRA’s five year waiver. Both parties agree
that once certain conditions are met, a waiver for the Gold Line Corridor (G Line) may be granted to allow revenue operations
to commence. RTD believes that the conditions will be met to allow the additional operations to commence and does not
believe an additional waiver will be necessary after the expiration of the five year period.

NOTE K – TAX, SPENDING AND DEBT LIMITATIONS

The Colorado Governmental Immunity Act limits RTD’s tort claims exposure to $350 per person and $990 per occurrence for
claims that accrued after July 1, 2013 and before January 1, 2018. Claims that accrue after January 1, 2018 are subject to
limits of $387 per person and $1,093 per occurrence.

* Fiscal year 2015 was the 1st year of implementation, therefore only three years are shown.

Assumption changes for the Fiscal Year Ending December 31, 2017 (December 31, 2016 measurement date, January 1, 2016 actuarial valuation date): The mortality assumptions were updated
to RP-2014 blue-collar tables published by the Society of Actuaries with project scale MP-2017. This change increased the liabilities by 2.113 million.

Assumption changes for the Fiscal Year Ending December 31, 2016 (December 31, 2015 measurement date, January 1, 2015 actuarial valuation date): Assumption changes were a result of a
change in the Single Discount Rate changing from 5.00 percent to 4.54 percent, measured at the end of the year.

* Fiscal year 2015 was the 1st year of implementation, therefore only three years are shown.

Assumption changes for the Fiscal Year Ending December 31, 2017 (December 31, 2016 measurement date, January 1, 2016 actuarial valuation date): the
administrative expense assumption was updated from $165,000 per year, payable monthly, to $150,000 per year, payable monthly. The updated administrative expense
assumption is expected to be more reflective of future administrative expenses for the Plan. The administrative expense assumption is used for determining the
actuarially determined contribution and does not impact Total Pension Liability.

Assumption changes for the Fiscal Year Ending December 31, 2016 (December 31, 2015 measurement date, January 1, 2015 actuarial valuation date): the amount
reported as Assumption Changes resulted from a change in the salary increase assumption (average weighted salary increase changed from 4.00% to 5.00%). This
change is expected to be more reflective of future plan experience.

Auditing standards require the auditor to ensure that those charged with governance receive additional information
regarding the scope and results of the audit that may assist the governing body in overseeing the financial reporting and
disclosure process for which management is responsible. The following section describes matters which are required to be
reported to you.

Regional Transportation District
We have audited the basic financial statements of RTD for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our audit was performed
in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards
applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the
United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement and presented in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit
evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. We also assessed the accounting principles
used by RTD and the reasonableness of significant estimates made by RTD’s management, as well as evaluated the
overall financial statement presentation.

Professional standards also require that we obtain a
significant understanding of RTD’s internal control to plan
the audit. However, such understanding is required for the
purpose of determining our audit procedures and not to

Accordingly, we express no such assurance.

Our responsibility, as described by professional standards,
is to express an opinion about whether the financial
statements prepared by management with your
assistance are fairly presented, in all material respects, in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles and whether RTD complied in all material
respects with the applicable compliance requirements of
its major federal programs. Our audit of the financial

Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and was not designed
to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies, and therefore,
material weaknesses or significant deficiencies may exist that were not identified.

A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a
material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance.

A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control, such that there is a
reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity’s financial statements will not be prevented, or
detected and corrected, on a timely basis. We did not identify any deficiencies that we would consider to be a
material weakness.

A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or
employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, misstatements
on a timely basis.

Regional Transportation District
In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of RTD as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2017, in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, we
considered RTD’s internal control over financial reporting (internal control) as a basis for designing our auditing
procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinions on the financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of RTD’s internal control. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness
of RTD’s internal control.

As the project is nearing full completion with several amendments and anticipated amendments to contract
provisions, we recommend that management perform a comprehensive review of the key clauses of the
P3 agreement, which include but are not limited to, completion of project, termination clauses and changes in
service, for any potential accounting, budgetary and financial reporting impacts. We would recommend
performing this review at least annually with a key member of financial management related to the impacted
areas as noted above.

We noted that the P3 contract/projected deviated from the original timeline, scope and payment terms due to
economic and inflationary changes in the Denver Metro Area. Review of the anticipated timeline and accounting
impacts was evaluated at inception of the agreement, regarding the impact to the accounting, budgetary and
legal impacts; however, the impacts to financial reporting were not consistently evaluated throughout the project
to consider the changes.

The recodes occur for various reasons not limited to correcting errors, utilizing
different funding sources or refining/finalizing the accounting for a project. The
recode entries are created by the budget analyst and reapproved by the
individuals who approved the original transactions. The Accounting Manager then
reviews and approves posting of the entry. While the Accounting Manager will
consult with the FasTracks Program Control Manager or the Chief Financial Officer,
depending on the nature and sensitivity of the recode, there is no other formal
documentation regarding approval of the recode. We recommended that
management continue to enhance the policy whereby recodes that meet certain
quantitative or qualitative characteristics, such as a change in funding source or
project, be approved by the Program Control Manager or other appropriately
designated individual.

Subject:

Budget Transfer for Commuter Rail Third Party
Services

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: May 9, 2018
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: May 22, 2018

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors approve a budget transfer of $2.82 million from the FasTracks Management Reserve to the
commuter rail operations budget for third party reimbursable projects to allow RTD to compensate
Denver Transit Partners (DTP) for costs it will incur for work associated with third party agreements .
The FasTracks Management Reserve will be replenished in the 2018 Amended Budget with the funds
that will be received from third parties to compensate RTD for the impacts to its operation.
This action addresses two of the General Manager’s goals for 2018:
Delivery of Transit Services, and Task Goal #1 – Fiscal Sustainability.

Core Goal #1 – Successful

BACKGROUND
Since the T-Rex project, RTD has worked with third party partners, including stakeholders, local
governments, and private entities, on betterments associated with its construction projects. These
betterments have included enhancements to RTD rail lines and facilities beyond the original
construction plans and concurrent construction of associated facilities for third parties. The third
parties requesting the work reimburse RTD for all costs associated with these betterments, so these
betterments are done at no net cost to RTD.
With the opening of the Eagle commuter rail lines, RTD also may see service impacts from third
party construction projects that require access to the right-of-way. These could include utilities that
pass under the track, or construction on bridges over the track. In these instances, DTP may be
required to provide access to the track, or to modify service, to allow the third party construction to
proceed in a safe and timely fashion.
DISCUSSION
RTD anticipates that eight third-party projects planned for 2018 will impact operations on the Eagle
P3 projects. These impacts may include construction of the actual betterments, provision of
flaggers to ensure safety along the corridor for third party construction, power shutdowns a t the
locations of the improvements, and potential bus bridges to provide service to patrons during a
shutdown of service. RTD must pay DTP for its costs related to these improvements, or contract
with a private bus operator to provide bus bridges when RTD does not have operators available to
provide the service. This transfer will allow RTD, DTP, and its third party partner entities to continue
work on these projects in a timely manner.

FINANCIAL IMPACT

Packet Pg. 220

11.B

There will be no net financial impact to RTD. RTD will be compensated by third parties for all costs
incurred on their behalf. These revenues will be included in the 2018 Amended Budget and will be
used to replenish the FasTracks Management Reserve.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit
Committee that the RTD Board of Directors approve a budget transfer of $2. 82 million from
the FasTracks Management Reserve to the commuter rail operations budget for third party
reimbursable projects to allow RTD to compensate Denver Transit Partners (DTP) for costs it
will incur for work associated with third party agreements. The FasTracks Management
Reserve will be replenished in the 2018 Amended Budget with the funds that will be received
from third parties to compensate RTD for the impacts to its operation.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not approve the requested budget transfer at
this time. Instead, include this request as part of the 2018 Amended Budget. This action is
not recommended since it will delay work on the associated betterments and on construction
projects undertaken by outside entities.

Subject:

Increase Fixed-Route Contract Authority and
Budget Transfer due to Operator Wage
Increases

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to increase contract authority for the following fixedroute contracts: First Transit “Group 24” (contract #14-DH-003); Transdev “Group 25” (contract
#14-DH-021); First Transit “Group 26” (contract #15-DH-064); and First Transit “Group 27”
(contract #16-DH-055); to cover increased costs incurred due to proposed operator wage increases
over the term of the contract.
 Group 24 – add up to $2,327,316.00 to increase the contract authority on contract #14-DH003 from $130,465,884.00, as approved by the Board of Directors on March 18, 2014, to a
revised contract authority of $132,793,200.00.
 Group 25 – add up to $2,432,022.00 to increase the contract authority on contract #14-DH021 from $139,831,296.00, as approved by the Board of Directors on July 1, 2014, to a
revised contract authority of $142,263,318.00.
 Group 26 – add up to $2,786,932.00 to increase the contract authority on contract #15-DH064 from $70,188,522.00, as approved by the Board of Directors on July 7, 2015, to a
revised contract authority of $72,975,454.00.
 Group 27 – add up to $6,841,208.00 to increase the contract authority on contract #16-DH055 from $141,838,638.00, as approved by the Board of Directors on April 25, 2017, to a
revised contract authority of $148,679,846.00.
The total increase in contract authority is up to $14,387,479.00 over the next four (4) years while
these services are rebid.
It is further recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize budget transfers in a total amount not to exceed $4,998,797.00 from the 2018
Board-appropriated reserve to the following fixed-route service contracts to cover the increased costs
incurred due to proposed private contractor operator wage increases for 2018:
 Group 24 (contract #14-DH-003) - $1,508,841.00
 Group 25 (contract #14-DH-021) - $1,042,295.00
 Group 26 (contract #15-DH-064) - $878,518.00
 Group 27 (contract #16-DH-055) - $1,569,143.00
This action supports Core Goal #1, Successful Delivery of Transit Services; Task Goal #1, Fiscal
Sustainability; and Task Goal #2, Workforce and Human Capital.
BACKGROUND:
RTD currently contracts with two companies to provide fixed-route service. These two companies
are First Transit and Transdev. They operate under the terms of four (4) separate contracts, each of

Packet Pg. 222

12.C

which is for a three (3) year term with two (2) one-year options. Collectively, these contractors
provide approximately 45% of RTD’s fixed-route bus service.
First Transit provides service under three contracts:
 “Group 24” (“First Transit Commerce City”) which is operated out of the First Transit
Commerce City location. This contract includes local service in metro Denver and was
implemented on 8/17/14. This contract provides approximately 334,700 revenue hours of
service per year.
 “Group 26” (“First Transit Longmont”) which is operated out of the First Transit Longmont
location. This contract includes local service in Boulder and Longmont and was implemented
on 1/3/16. This contract provides approximately 189,400 hours of service per year.
 “Group 27” (“First Transit Denver”) which is operated out of the First Transit Denver location.
This contract includes local service in metro Denver and was implemented on 5/13/17. This
contract provides approximately 344,600 hours of service per year.
Transdev provides service under one contract:
 “Group 25” (“Transdev Englewood”) which is operated out of the Transdev Englewood
location. This contract includes local service in metro Denver and was implemented on
1/4/15. This contract provides approximately 339,700 hours of service per year.
DISCUSSION:
Historically, the starting wages paid for operators by the private contractors have been approximately
$1.00 per hour less than the starting wage for bus operators for RTD. In February of 2018, RTD renegotiated its collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with the Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU) and
increased the starting wage for bus and rail operators from $17.59 to $19.40 per hour. The starting
wages for bus operators for the private contractors are currently as follows:
First Transit Commerce City (Group 24)
Transdev (Group 25)
First Transit Longmont (Group 26)
First Transit Denver (Group 27)

$15.38 per hour
$15.71 per hour
$15.43 per hour
$15.43 per hour

Due to the low unemployment rate in Colorado and the highly competitive labor market, there is
concern that the disparity in operator starting wages between the private contractors and RTD will
entice a high number of bus operators at the private contractor operations to “jump ship” – to quit
their jobs and apply for jobs with RTD. As a result, our contract partners will lose employees and be
unable to meet their service commitments to RTD and our customers. This will result in dropped
service for our customers and a decrease in reliability, one of the primary determinants of transit
ridership. In order to mitigate a large-scale migration, it is recommended that RTD renegotiate the
existing Contract Agreements with First Transit and Transdev so that private contractor operator
wages can be adjusted to a more competitive amount relative to the new starting wage for RTD
operators and the local Denver labor market for drivers.
After extensive conversations with First Transit and Transdev, the parties have mutually agreed that
adjustments to the starting wage for First Transit and Transdev bus operators would be appropriate
given the current market conditions and the result of RTD’s contract negotiations and that the
adjusted starting wages for the private contractors should be between $18.00 and $18.50.
In addition to the adjustment to starting wages, it will also be necessary to adjust the wage scales
for existing operators as well. Wages for operator trainers, dispatchers and street supervisors will

Packet Pg. 223

12.C

also be increased as wages for these positions are typically determined based on an operator wage
plus a stated per-hour increase (eg.- the operator wage plus $1.00 per hour).
The proposed Board action will provide the necessary increases in contract authority to cover the
increases in wage costs from a proposed effective date of April 1, 2018, through the end date of the
existing contracts. Language will be included in the contract amendments to ensure that ALL of the
increased compensation resulting from this action will go towards the agreed upon wage increases
for drivers and related positions and that none of the increased compensation will go towards
corporate overhead and/or profit.
The projected timelines for rebidding the First Transit and Transdev contracts are as follows:
First Transit “Group 24” – expires August, 2019 – to be rebid in 2018
Transdev “Group 25” – expires January, 2020 – to be rebid in 2019
First Transit “Group 26” – expires January, 2021 – to be rebid in 2020
First Transit “Group 27” – expires May, 2022 – to be rebid in 2021
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
The total cost of the private contractor wage increases for 2018 is $4,998,797.00. It is
recommended that RTD transfer funds from the 2018 Board-appropriated reserve, to the above
referenced contracts, to cover the cost. The Board-appropriated reserve will be replenished in the
2018 Amended Budget. Funds for subsequent years will be included in the new 2019-2024 Midterm Financial Plan (previously known as the SBP) and in the requested budgets for those years.
ALTERNATIVES:
1) Increase contract authority for the following fixed-route contracts: First Transit “Group 24”
(contract #14-DH-003); Transdev “Group 25” (contract #14-DH-021); First Transit “Group 26”
(contract #15-DH-064); and First Transit “Group 27” (contract #16-DH-055); to cover increased
costs incurred due to proposed operator wage increases over the term of the contract.
 Group 24 – add up to $2,327,316.00 to increase the contract authority on contract #14-DH003 from $130,465,884.00, as approved by the Board of Directors on March 18, 2014, to a
revised contract authority of $132,793,200.00.
 Group 25 – add up to $2,432,022.00 to increase the contract authority on contract #14-DH021 from $139,831,296.00, as approved by the Board of Directors on July 1, 2014, to a
revised contract authority of $142,263,318.00.
 Group 26 – add up to $2,786,932.00 to increase the contract authority on contract #15-DH064 from $70,188,522.00, as approved by the Board of Directors on July 7, 2015, to a
revised contract authority of $72,975,454.00.
 Group 27 – add up to$6,841,208.00 to increase the contract authority on contract #16-DH055 from $141,838,638.00, as approved by the Board of Directors on April 25, 2017, to a
revised contract authority of $148,679,846.00.
The total increase in contract authority is up to $14,387,479.00 over the next four (4) years while
these contracts are re-bid.
In addition, authorize budget transfers in a total amount not to exceed $4,998,797.00 from the
2018 Board-appropriated reserve to the following fixed-route service contracts to cover the increased
costs incurred due to proposed operator wage increases for 2018:
 Group 24 (contract #14-DH-003) - $1,508,841.00
 Group 25 (contract #14-DH-021) - $1,042,295.00
 Group 26 (contract #15-DH-064) - $878,518.00

Packet Pg. 224

12.C



Group 27 (contract #16-DH-055) - $1,569,143.00

2) Do not increase contract authority for cost adjustments to the fixed-route contracts or authorize
budget transfers to cover the increased costs associated with wage adjustments for private
contractor bus operators and related positions. This course of action is not recommended, as it
may prompt a mass exodus of employees from the private contractors and further increase our
collective inability to meet service requirements and the expectations of our customers.
