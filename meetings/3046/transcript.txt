ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, Ms. McManus. We've convened a special Board
meeting tonight to recognize and pay tribute to our current General Manager and CEO, Paul J.
Ballard. Mr. Ballard, the RTD Board has created a proclamation recognizing your outstanding
work over the past eight months. At this time, I'd like to read the document into the record.
Paul J. Ballard, whereas Paul J. Ballard is leaving RTD after serving as the agency's Chief
Executive Officer and General Manager since February 2020 and whereas RTD Board of
Directors selected Mr. Ballard among a number of excellent candidates to serve in the interim as
the agency's GM following the retirement of David Genova and whereas having served as
President, CEO, or GM of several transit agencies for the better part of four decades, Mr.
Ballard's wealth of experience uniquely qualified him to rise to meet RTD's challenges and
opportunities and whereas even though Mr. Ballard's tenure with the RTD began a mere weeks
before the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, drastically altering daily life in Colorado and
across the globe, he quickly took the reins and provided sage counsel and operational expertise to
combat the financial and public health threats facing the agencies all while maintaining a level of
service necessary to support first responders and those critically dependent on public transit and
whereas, in response to the drastic loss of fare and tax revenue due to the impacts of the
pandemic, Mr. Ballard assembled a task force charged with ensuring the solvency of the agency
in the years to come and whereas in addition to his other duties, Mr. Ballard served as a member
of the DRCOG Regional Transportation Committee and the ad hoc committee on RTD's code of
conduct and as a trusted advisor to the General Manager Executive Search Committee in its task
of identifying a candidate to serve in the role of the GM CEO on an ongoing basis and whereas

Mr. Ballard successfully fulfilled his charge to oversee the completion of the North Metro rail
line, which opened for service on September 21, 2020 and whereas though he is departing RTD
in November 2020, Mr. Ballard's leadership and vision has left the agency in a position to
succeed in the coming months and years, now therefore be it resolved by the RTD Board of
Directors that we extend our deepest thanks and commendations to Paul J. Ballard for his tireless
service, leadership, and advocacy during his tenure as the RTD Chief Executive Officer and
General Manager, dated this 27th date of October 2020.
Do we have a motion to approve the proclamation?
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
DOUG TISDALE: Madam Chair, Director Tisdale moves that-[LAUGHTER]
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I think all 15 want to move this forward.
DOUG TISDALE: Yep.
PEGGY CATLIN: I think I was first.
TROY WHITMORE: Second, Whitmore.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah. I heard first Vice Chair Catlin and then Director Tisdale.
At this time, I would like to call on each Director in alphabetical order to see if they would like
to say a few words. Director Broom.
BOB BROOM: Just a big thank-you. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Secretary Buzek.
VINCE BUZEK: Thanks, Madam Chair, and thank you, Paul. You know, the statements made in
this proclamation just scratch the surface of all that you have done. And I'm proud to have my
name attached to the proclamation. Thanks a lot.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: First Vice Chair Catlin.
PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you, Madam Chair. Paul, I echo the sentiments of Director Buzek and
want to punctuate the piece about the sage advice and counsel in the General Manager Executive
Search Committee. As Chair of that committee, I could not have handled it without your help. So
thank you many, many times over.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. Second Vice Chair Cook?

SHELLEY COOK: Yes. Just want to say thank you. I think it was Vince who once expressed
appreciation for Paul's steady hand in a storm. And I've been very grateful that we had him on
board and somebody with his experience, a true vet, who could see us through the past several
months. So thank you, Paul.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Folska.
CLAUDIA FOLKSA: Thanks, Madam Chair. Paul, it has been such an honor and a privilege to
get to know you over the last eight months. Your professionalism, elegance, and grace in the
midst of so many things that were completely unforeseen and out of anyone's control, you did
such a fine job. Job well done. And thank you so much for your work and your dedication and
your service.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. Treasurer Guissinger.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Well, yes, I would agree with the statements that have been said. And
especially what came to mind was what Director Cook said that you brought a steady hand in a
crazy time and planned the task force and so many other things that you did, getting the N Line
finished, and just always being open to our calls and dealing with our problems honestly and
openly. And I appreciate it. Thanks.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. Director Lewis.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Thank you, Madam Chair. Mr. Ballard, I'd actually like to thank you for a
few things. I'd like to thank you for your work on the transit ambassadors. I know you and I had
conversations many, many moons ago. And I appreciate your work in that area. I think it is a
model that we can continue into the coming years.
I'd also like to thank you for the contract extension that you've provided to our contractors.
During this global pandemic, a lot of things have really been up in the air. And I appreciate your
commitment to our contractors.
And then finally, I'd like to thank you for your swiftness as it came to the rear-door boarding. I
think it most certainly saved lives, and I appreciate your work in that regard. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. Director Lubow.
JUDY LUBOW: Yes. Thank you. I just want to say, Paul, it's been a pleasure working with you.
And it's my hope that your helpful interaction with RTD will continue in the future.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Menten.
NATALIE MENTEN: Thanks. I don't have anything to add to the other comments.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Mihalik.

KEN MIHALIK: Thank you, Madam Chair. Yeah, just, Mr. Ballard, you did exactly what you
said you were going to do and more. So thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Tisdale.
DOUG TISDALE: Thank you very much, Madam Chair. Mr. Ballard, it has been a privilege and
a pleasure to know you and to work with you. And we cannot hope to somehow fit into the
words of this resolution or any words that any of us may give now to encompass the incredible
gratitude and appreciation that we have for your stellar efforts during incredibly challenging
times. I thank you. And, Madam Chair, I ask unanimous consent to revise and extend my
comments on the record. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, sir. Director Walker.
JEFF WALKER: Thanks. Mr. Ballard, thank you for your work here-- the guidance,
collaboration, your raw honesty that was delivered with finesse. Safe travels. See you wherever
you end up. Hopefully I'll get to see you before you take off.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. Director Whitmore.
TROY WHITMORE: Mr. Ballard, it's hard to add to the descriptors here, but I'm going to try. I
had a opportunity to visit with Paul in person today. And one of the things that he mentioned as
we discussed a few matters is his eternal optimism. And I think we felt that from the day that you
began and till this month. Time flies? Well, maybe. I'm sure it seemed like it drug a bit at times.
But here we are in November.
So we're saying so long. But we do appreciate your professionalism and some of the other
descriptors like grace that certainly permeated your time with us. And I know I learned a lot
under your tutelage and your decision-making process. So I appreciate it immensely. And as one
of my colleagues said, you may not be done with us, because I have your phone number.
Godspeed to you, sir, and your family.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. Director Williams. Director Williams?
BOB BROOM: How do we do a virtual round of applause?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah, I'm not quite sure. I guess we could do a hurrah. Well, I
don't see Director Williams.
KATE WILLIAMS: I'm here.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Oh, there you go. Go ahead, Director Williams. You have the
floor.

KATE WILLIAMS: I got cut off somehow. It was probably a good thing. Mr. Ballard, I can't
imagine that anyone could have done anything any better. Thank you for being with RTD and
with Denver in this interesting time. And I'm only sorry that your stay isn't any longer.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. And Mr. Ballard, I would be remiss if I didn't just
say to you personally, I am beyond grateful to you and your wife, Susan, for uprooting your life
and coming to Denver to help us go through this first part of our adventure together. As the
Board Chair, I feel incredibly blessed to have crossed my life's journeys path with you to help
move this agency forward. I think that I was privileged to work with such a man of grace and
integrity. And on behalf, you know the entire Board of Directors is standing right now honoring
you and wishing you godspeed.
I will now call for the vote, and we will proceed in alphabetical order. Director Broom.
BOB BROOM: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Secretary Buzek.
VINCE BUZEK: A misty yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: First Vice Chair Catlin.
PEGGY CATLIN: Absolutely yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Second Vice Chair Cook.
SHELLEY COOK: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Folska.
CLAUDIA FOLKSA: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Treasurer Guissinger.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Lewis.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Lubow.
JUDY LUBOW: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Menten.

NATALIE MENTEN: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Mihalik.
KEN MIHALIK: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Tisdale.
DOUG TISDALE: An emphatic yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Walker.
JEFF WALKER: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Whitmore.
TROY WHITMORE: Absolutely yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Williams.
KATE WILLIAMS: Yes, ma'am.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: And I am Yes. Let the record show it is unanimous to move this
motion forward. Mr. Ballard, the floor is yours.
PAUL BALLARD: Well, thank you, Madam Chair and members of the Board. I sincerely
appreciate all of the comments you have made. When I saw that this was on the agenda and that
it was going to be voted on, I was holding my breath a little bit. But I tended to relax my breath
as I heard the positive comments. So thank you. I do love unanimous decisions. And I want to
thank you for that.
But little did we know, when we met in January-- and if you remember, I thought you held a
parade for my interview, but it turned out to be the Stock Show Parade. But it felt good anyways.
We didn't know what was going to-- what was just around the corner and what was going to
happen in just a few weeks. By the second weekend of March-- the second week of March, we
were dealing with a lethal challenge in the coronavirus. We knew very little about it or how to
respond. But by working as a team, the Board, management, employees, ATU 1001, and our
contractors for the bus and the rail services, we figured it out. We took multiple steps to keep our
customers and employees as safe as possible.
Collectively, we then moved to the next logical steps-- adjusting the budget, our services, and the
RTD itself. These are not easy challenges, and very difficult decisions are still being made. In the
middle of all this, we opened up the N Line last month, on September 21. Progress is being made
with our external relations through the Accountability Committee organized by our Chair Angie
Rivera-Malpiede and several of you on Board.

The work of our Coronavirus Task Force under the direction of Chair Bruce Abel is wrapping up
its work and laying out RTD's path to the future. So while I do sincerely appreciate the
sentiments so wonderfully expressed in the proclamation, I want to expand that proclamation to
include everyone who has worked together to help RTD emerge as a stronger and more
responsive regional agency.
I want to thank each of you for the personal relationships that we have developed. It's
unfortunate that because of the coronavirus, we didn't have the opportunity to spend more time
together. And I expand that beyond the Board to RTD employees, to the community. But we all
learned how to use Zoom and Microsoft Come to Meetings.
And I guess the one phrase that I will remember from my tenure in Denver at the RTD is "sorry,
I had my mute button on." So anyway, with that, I really do want to thank everyone. This is a
great honor. I sincerely appreciate the proclamation. And I just want to say thank you from the
bottom of my heart. I appreciate it
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Mr. Ballard what was the one thing? Because you cut out.
[LAUGHS]
PAUL BALLARD: Oh, you mean the one phrase?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes.
PAUL BALLARD: Oh, I'm sorry. No. What I was saying was the one phrase that I will always
remember from my time at the RTD in Denver is "oh, sorry, I left my mute button on," because
that's how we all met, and that's how we all communicated. And that's what everybody said,
including me, hundreds and hundreds of times. So I will never forget that phrase.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. All right. Thank you so very much, sir. Well, seeing
no other business to discuss during this special Board meeting, I will now entertain a motion to
adjourn.
BOB BROOM: So moved.
VINCE BUZEK: Buzek.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: So who was the first? Buzek was the second.
BOB BROOM: Broom.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Broom. OK. Any opposition to adjourning the special Board
meeting? Hearing none, the special Board meeting is now adjourned at 5:50 PM. We will
convene the regular Board meeting here in just a moment. So please stick around. OK.
ROGER: Did you want, Angie, to go right into the new meeting?

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I think so, Roger. Let's go ahead and go.
LYNN GUISSINGER: OK.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Good evening. I will now call the Tuesday, October 27 RTD
Board meeting to order. We are convened as of 5:51 PM Mountain Daylight Time. Please note
that under the current circumstances, the official meetings of the RTD Board of Directors are
being held remotely in the interest of public health, safety, and welfare.
During this time, meetings will be primarily audio recorded. The audio recordings, along with
the unofficial minutes of the meetings, will be posted as soon as practicable on the Board's
website. Please visit rtd-denver.com and scroll to the bottom of the page for the link to the Board
of Directors page.
If anyone on the phone would like to engage with the Board during the public participation
portion of tonight's agenda, please press star 3 now. You will be placed into a queue, and I will
call on you at the appropriate time. Directors and members of the staff, for the sake of the record,
if you would like to be acknowledged during tonight's proceedings, I would ask you to please
announce your name and wait for me to call you before proceeding to speak. Speaking out of
turn will only add confusion to the record and to its proceedings.
Please note that at the appropriate time during our discussion and voting processes later on in the
evening, I will call on each Director in turn. So please know that your time to speak will come.
And if possible, please hold your comments until that time.
We usually do a Pledge of Allegiance, but this evening we will dispense with the Pledge of
Allegiance. Ms. McManus, I'd like to do the roll call for our quorum.
BARBARA MCMANUS: I'd like to note that we have done a roll call, and I think all directors
are still on, so we can move forward.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, ma'am. OK. The roll call was taken during our
special Board meeting. And I'll note for the record that we still have a quorum.
At RTD, safety is our core value. And I'd like to begin this meeting with a safety shorts safety
briefing. Frequently and thoroughly wash your hands. Continue to practice physical distancing. 6
feet is a minimum. Minimize your time spent in poorly ventilated indoor public areas, especially
when large number of people are present. And wear a mask at all times in public spaces such as
in office spaces and grocery stores and while using public transportation.
I'll mention this again. If anyone on the phone would like to engage with the Board during the
public participation period of tonight's agenda, please press star 3 now. You will be placed in a
queue, and I will call on you in the appropriate time. This evening, there are no retiree awards.
And now we will move on to our public participation period, which is open to anyone who wants
to speak. As is our custom, we will allow any of our elected officials present to speak first so
they can get back to their meetings and attend to business.

If you've indicated that you would like to speak to the Board by dialing star 3 on your phone, I
will call your name in order which you signed up. Each speaker will have 3 minutes. And please
also bear in mind that participating in this process, you are being audio recorded. So if you do
not wish to be audio recorded, then your comments will have to be submitted in writing, and you
will not have the opportunity to speak this evening.
If any speaker has documentation or reference materials for the Board, please email those
materials to the Board office at the following email address-- board.office@rtd-denver.com. The
public participation period is not the appropriate venue for back-and-forth discussion amongst
speakers and the Board. Please do not anticipate that the Board will respond to questions and
comments at this time. For this reason, it is important that you state your name and address so
that someone may follow up with you at a later time.
For anyone just joining the call, if you would like to speak to the Board, you can press star 3 on
your phone now, and you will be placed into the queue when it's your turn to speak. I will call
your name. And our first speaker is Loren Hansen. Miss Hansen, if you wouldn't mind stating
your name and your address for the record, please.
LOREN HANSEN: Absolutely. My name is Loren Hansen. I'm located at 1201 Kalamath Street,
80204 in Denver, District C.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah.
LOREN HANSEN: All righty. That's sufficient?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes, please.
LOREN HANSEN: Awesome. OK, let me continue with my comment then. Well, my name is
Loren Hansen. I've been a long-time caller-- or long-time listener, first-time caller. I am the
moderator of a public transit enthusiast group on Facebook called RTD Memes for Front Range
Teens and have been a lifelong advocate for public transportation. I am commenting in regards to
this Board's decision not to approve fare-free transportation on Election Day despite the fact that
the Board found it in their budget to renew a contract with Allied Universal after Raverro
Stinnett's beating by officers on a train.
And despite the fact the Board approved fare-free transportation during the beginning of the
COVID-19 pandemic, they did not find it in their budgets nor their hearts to approve fare-free
transit on Election Day. However, as a private citizen, I just want to make people aware that the
Directors in the districts A, F, and G are up for re-election and are the ones that voted No on this
measure. I will also encourage you and anyone else listening in on this call to explore the options
of Directors that would be supportive of fare-free transportation on Election Day and beyond.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Mr. Hansen-LOREN HANSEN: And that's it.

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK, thank you.
LOREN HANSEN: Yeah, that's the end of my comment. My bad. Sorry.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: No. Thank you, sir. Our next speaker is Brett Feddersen. Mr.
Feddersen, if you could state your name and your address for the record, please.
BRETT FEDDERSEN: Yes. Brett Feddersen. I live at 1845 East 134th Circle in Thornton,
Colorado, Director Whitmore's district.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Go ahead, sir.
BRETT FEDDERSEN: Yes. So I am the Manager of Shared Technical Services here at RTD.
And I'm calling tonight representing myself, but I'm advocating for all RTD employees. The
reason for my call tonight is to talk about the database of personally identifiable information that
is available on the website www.nataliementen.com.
On August 4, I received an inquiry from our HR division asking if I had filed for an
unemployment claim. This, of course, led to a phone call with my boss that was 75% playful and
25% overly concerned to confirm that I was indeed an RTD employee. Spoiler alert-- I am an
employee.
That brief investigation complete, I'm now saddled with the burden of calling the Department of
Labor and Employment and flagging this claim as fraudulent, filing a police report after playing
a game of ping pong between police districts to find out who actually had jurisdiction, and
setting up fraud monitoring on my identity for the next couple of years. In the next few days,
other members of our team found that they too were the victims of identity fraud, including
having credit cards opened in their name, which brings me to a website which freely advertises
RTD and other public sector employees' data.
This website has three key pieces of personally identified data, including our salaries. To put it
simply, this action, this website is wrong. The website is not an action of RTD demonstrating
transparency. This is a website associated with a private citizen that poses or actually commits
material harm to the hardworking RTD employees.
The threat landscape around each individual's most precious digital commodity, our identities,
grows uglier by the minute. This threat demands and deserves the utmost in protection from the
entity best able to defend its employees, that entity being RTD.
While I get the burden of being overly obsessed and concerned with my own identity for the next
few years, each of you has the power to do something positive on the subject. Director Menten,
you have it in your power to take action tonight to take this salary data down. To the Board of
Directors who remain after the election, I ask you to consider a policy change to limit or prohibit
the release of this and other personal identifying information. You have the power to protect
RTD employees from further harm in this regard.

It is true that the issue of salary transparency has been en vogue across the public sector the past
several years. I leave you tonight with the conclusion, with the power and scope of cyber
criminals, releasing this type of information is not the price of being a public employee. It's a
punishment for it. Thank you for your time and consideration.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, sir. Next, we have Molly McKinley. Miss
McKinley, if you could please state your name and your address for the record.
MOLLY MCKINLEY: Yes. Good evening. My name is Molly McKinley, and I live at 1150
North Downing Street, Denver, 80218. And I'm here tonight on behalf of the Denver Streets
Partnership to offer some comments on the January 2021 service changes. The Denver Streets
Partnership is a coalition of community organizations advocating for people-friendly streets. And
we know that a high-functioning transit system-- excuse me-- is essential for achieving our
vision of streets as living public spaces that connect us to all the things like jobs, schools,
services, and each other that are designed to foster health, happiness, and opportunity for all.
We understand that you're moving forward with the January 2021 service changes within the
context of the massive budget shortfalls due to COVID-19 and that new funding will be required
to return service to pre-pandemic levels. So for that reason, we're vigorously advocating for at
least $32 billion in federal emergency relief funding for RTD and other transit agencies across
the country.
We really applaud you for being responsive to the needs of those who depend on transit most
during this difficult time by increasing the service along the most heavily used routes on Federal
Boulevard and West Colfax. These corridors are home to some of the most diverse
neighborhoods in Denver, including a mixture of immigrant, low income, young adult, and
senior populations as well as college campus communities, many of whom are the hardest hit
during this economic crisis. Federal and Colfax are main streets for these neighborhoods. And by
providing access to these services, schools, parks, you know, you're doing a service to the
community.
Increasing transit service will also help ensure safe physical distancing on the buses, but will also
help ease the pain of the overall service level reductions for these communities that have been hit
the hardest. We also appreciate that these service changes do not include any reductions in
paratransit service, a really important lifeline for many of our community members who have
limited transportation options.
Finally, we just urge you to maintain this responsive approach and focus on equity as you
consider future service changes and longer term system-wide changes once the RTD Reimagine
process is restarted. We hope that one key priority moving forward is making sure that we're
putting service where we have the most people and the most transit dependency. Thank you for
your time.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you so much. Next, we have Michael Garcia. Mr. Garcia,
if you wouldn't mind stating your name and your address for the record, please.

MICHAEL GARCIA: Yeah. Michael Garcia, Sheridan, Colorado, 80110, Key Steward ATU
1772. Are we good?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes, please.
MICHAEL GARCIA: I'm also a coach operator full time. Kudos first of all to Mr. Ballard. My
notes-- I'm trying to catch up. Yeah, the past deadline for guaranteed moneys with RTD was
through October 31. A few Trans dev operators have already quit and/or resigned due to last
deadline.
Now we found out last night-- yesterday that it's extended through November 30. This is just bad
for overall culture. I mean, can you give a week or two notice? Is that asking too much?
Couple other things I have as I was listening. Miss Ballard, I believe you had mentioned drastic
loss of money due to fares slash COVID. Again, I call when I can on these meetings to the
Board. Please, again, if fares were enforced-- I'm an operator. You've got to be on the front line.
If fares were enforced, it would not be necessary to increase fares yearly, i.e. 30, 31, 16, 15
routes. One other thing-- well, two other things. Payroll pay-- is this on or off the table? Seems
like it's off to most of us, the operators.
And lastly, with the increase of COVID, I believe it's imperative we go back to rear door policy.
And if you cannot do this for us operators-- I'm speaking to you, the Board-- why don't you-well, actually I'd like to invite each member to ride the route 30-31 for eight hours or 16 or 15
route for eight hours. Hands on-- that's how you learn the most.
Thank you for your time. And I would like to yield my rest of my time, because I believe I have
35 seconds left, to any other ATU 1772 member. Thank you for your time.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, sir. Our last speaker is Darlene "Witow." I hope,
Darlene, I'm not butchering your name. Please state your name and your address for the record,
please.
JODI WITTHAUS: So it's actually Jodi Witthaus. J-O-D-I.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: (LAUGHING) OK, thank you.
JODI WITTHAUS: [LAUGHS]
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: You have the floor, ma'am. Could you give us your address?
JODI WITTHAUS: Sure. My address is 5915 South Sycamore Street, Littleton, Colorado,
80120.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK, you have the floor.

JODI WITTHAUS: Thank you. So I am a blind Coloradan here to represent the National
Federation of the Blind. And so unfortunately, it's not going to be as formal as everybody else's
speeches. I thought they were great. I'm just here to show my face and to say it's really affecting
us blind Coloradans.
(VOICE BREAKING) And we just really need services. So-- sorry for getting so upset. But, you
know, one reason I moved to Colorado was for our RTD service. So whatever we can do to help
keep it stay alive, I would really appreciate it for us and everyone else. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. I see no other callers in the queue. So I'm going to
close the public participation period at this time. Thank all of you for calling in and talking with
the Board of Directors. We really appreciate your input.
All right. This evening, the committee meetings were included in your Board packet. Are there
any additional corrections other than those already noted?
SHONTEL LEWIS: Director Lewis.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Go ahead, Director Lewis.
SHONTEL LEWIS: I might have to wait, but I wanted to pull something from the unanimous
consent agenda. Would you like me to wait for that?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I think so. That would be great. Thank you.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Sure.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Is it from here? So those committee reports will stand as
submitted and will become part of the permanent record. Is it something within all of those,
Director Lewis?
SHONTEL LEWIS: I'm sorry. What did you say?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: My question to you is where is it that you need to pull from?
Which committee?
SHONTEL LEWIS: From the unanimous consent agenda.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK.
SHONTEL LEWIS: It's the January 2021 service change proposal.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: All right. All right. Hold on. Yeah. I'll be calling on you in a
little bit later. That would be great. Thank you,
JESSIE CARTER: Chair Malpiede? I'm sorry. This--

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes, go ahead, Mr. Carter. Yes.
JESSIE CARTER: I have just a housekeeping item. The Title VI review of the January 2021
service change proposal has been completed. So we will be able to say that the Title VI review
process has occurred, and there are no issues.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: All right, thank you, sir. OK. We'll be coming back to that.
Seeing this, these committee reports will stand as submitted and become part of the permanent
record. And there will be a piece under here under unanimous consent. So if there's questions, we
can bring it forward.
Currently, what I'd like to do is call on the General Manager oversight and performance
management update. Committee Chair Catlin, if you would at this time, please share with us
your comments regarding the GM executive search, GM Oversight and Performance
Management Committee, please.
PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you, Madam Chair. Most of the work of the GMES portion of our dual
committee roles has been concluded with the exception of putting forth a document on just kind
of a roadmap for going forward, a constructive review of processes and what it would take in the
event that we have a similar exercise in the future, hopefully not too near future. I would like to
say that I believe the outcome of the committee's work was very satisfactory.
Going forward, we have a standing meeting time on Thursdays at 8:00 o'clock in the morning.
We hope to keep those meetings to just an hour out of respect for members' other work
schedules. The committee, however, will not be meeting this Thursday but will be meeting next
week. One of the things that we want to get over the long term-- we want to meet our contractual
obligation with Debra Johnson to develop mutually a performance review plan. And so we have
120 days after her start date to do that. So the committee will be working with her on that.
In the interim, we wanted to have a fairly formal exit interview with Paul Ballard that is more of
a two-way street. We want to learn from him his assessment of the agency, not only with respect
to the 2020 goals, but just overall assessment of the agency in general and of the Board. And
then we in turn will provide feedback to him on his eight months with us of acting General
Manager and CEO-- or interim General Manager and CEO. So we will be doing that within the
next couple of weeks.
And I encourage Board members to provide topics that they would like to have discussed in that
exit interview. So with that, Madam Chair, we will be moving forward on the next phase of the
committee's work. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK, thank you. May I please have a motion to approve the
minutes from the regular Board meeting of September 29, 2020?
KATE WILLIAMS: So moved, Director Williams.
DOUG TISDALE: Whoops. Second, Tisdale.

TROY WHITMORE: Second, Whitmore.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK, I have Director Williams as the movement and Director
Tisdale as the second. Unless there's any discussion, we'll proceed to a voice vote. Are there any
No votes on the approval of the Board minutes? OK, hearing none, that motion is adopted, and
the minutes are approved.
Next is the Chair's report, and I'll keep my comments brief tonight. I cannot believe that we are
only one week away from a truly historic election evening. Four of the eight candidates for
election in the RTD Board of Directors are unopposed. And a fifth in District I has just been
appointed by the Boulder County Commissioners.
And while I'm sure we are all keeping our eyes on some of the big ticket races, there are also
three contested races for seats on the RTD Board for districts A, H, and G. Whoever the victor is
in each of these races, I think I speak on behalf of the entire Board in saying that we're looking
forward to communicating and working with all of you successful candidates in the months and
years ahead. Both the returning members and the new members who will be sworn in this
coming January will have a heavy lift in 2021 and beyond.
I would also like to note that our new General Manager Debra Johnson will be beginning her
tenure here at RTD on November 9, and we're very excited to have her here in Denver. I might
also add, she is starting on November 9 at 4:00 AM. So welcome, Debra. I hope it doesn't snow
that day, because it can be pretty cold early in the morning.
With that, I'd like to turn it over to the General Manager's report. Mr. Ballard, would you please
share with us-- I hate to think it's your final monthly report with our esteemed General Manager.
Mr. Ballard.
PAUL BALLARD: Well, thank you, Madam Chair. And for my final report, I will be quite brief.
I've already had my share of congratulations tonight. So I will leave it at that. And we've already
talked about how we got to this point in October of 2020. So I'd like to take just a brief moment
to talk about the future.
And I just want to offer just a couple of thoughts. Number one, I know that everyone on the
Board is thrilled with Debra Johnson coming on board on November 9. Throughout the whole
selection process, which I was privileged to be a part of, she constantly stood out as a real
outstanding applicant. And right through the whole process, she was clearly our best choice. And
so I'm really pleased with the Board's decision. She brings experience, talent, passion. And this is
going to turn out to be one of the best decisions the Board made in 2020 and maybe in a longer
period of time.
I also wanted to compliment the Board leadership. The Board has been decisive and proactive.
And with Angie Rivera-Malpiede and the Executive Committee at the helm, the future is bright
for RTD with this Board leadership. Your management team is strong and getting stronger. And
the corporate culture of a can-do attitude will only get stronger and stronger.

The employees of RTD are outstanding. Although I met far fewer than I had hoped to, it's clear
to me that our employees are a very special group of dedicated people.
And lastly, to our customers, please come back. We're ready to take care of your mobility needs
once again. We are safe and welcoming and really look forward to seeing you again on our
services. So come on back. We're ready for you. And with that, Madam Chair, I will turn it back
to you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, sir. Are there any questions for Mr. Ballard? I will
go through the list. Director Broom?
BOB BROOM: No, not at this time. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. Secretary Buzek.
VINCE BUZEK: No questions or comments. Thank you very much.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: First Vice Chair Catlin?
PEGGY CATLIN: Not at this time. Thank you, Madam Chair.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. Second Vice Chair Cook.
SHELLEY COOK: No, thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Folska.
CLAUDIA FOLKSA: No, thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Treasurer Guissinger.
LYNN GUISSINGER: No, thanks.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Lewis.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Nothing for me.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Lubow.
JUDY LUBOW: No, thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Menten. Director Menten? OK, I'll go to the next
person. Director Mihalik?
KEN MIHALIK: No questions or comments. Thanks.

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Tisdale.
DOUG TISDALE: Applause for the brevity and impactfulness of his report. Nothing further.
Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. Director Walker.
JEFF WALKER: Nothing from me Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Whitmore.
TROY WHITMORE: Nothing more for me. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Williams.
KATE WILLIAMS: I have nothing. Thank you, Madam Chair.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you so much. Director Menten, are you on the line?
NATALIE MENTEN: Yes. I have no question or comment. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, ma'am. OK. Thank you, Mr. Ballard. Next is our
unanimous consent. There are four items on the unanimous consent agenda this evening and
listed-- they're under 11 as actions A through D, the adoption of the pension plan contribution,
adoption of the 2021 benefit plan, the January 2021 service change proposal final, and adoption
of the 2021 performance measures. If anyone has a change to or questions on any of these items,
now is the time to advise the Chair. And we will, of course, be happy to pull the item or items
from unanimous consent agenda for consideration under recommended action.
I would also like to note that the following publications this past Thursday of the Board meeting
agenda packet-- RTD has received additional letters from elected officials, local jurisdictions,
and planning organizations regarding the January 2021 service change proposals. Those letters
will be added into the packet, which will be republished by the Board office tomorrow. Is there
any additional request to remove items from the consent agenda?
SHONTEL LEWIS: Director Lewis.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Go ahead, Director Lewis.
SHONTEL LEWIS: I'd like to pull the January 2021 service plan from the agenda, please-- the
unanimous consent agenda, please.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK. Thank you. So that will be moved. All right. Director
Lewis, go ahead.
TROY WHITMORE: Madam Chair?

SHONTEL LEWIS: Well, normally we pull it from the unanimous consent agenda, and then we
vote on the unanimous consent agenda. And then we come back to that topic.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you so very much. All right.
TROY WHITMORE: With that, I would make the motion, Madam Chair. This is Whitmore.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes.
DOUG TISDALE: Tisdale, second.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: All right. Whitmore, Tisdale. All right. All in favor? Or all of
those opposed, please. OK, hearing none, we have all of the agenda items approved with the
exception of pulling the January 2021 service change proposal final. Director Lewis, you have
the floor.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Thank you, Madam Chair. To Jessie's credit, he actually correctly assumed
that I was going to ask about the equity analysis as I hadn't seen it in our final agenda-- in our
final packet. And so I don't feel comfortable voting to approve the January 2021 service change
without that information.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK.
JESSIE CARTER: Chair Malpiede, this is Jessie Carter.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Please, Mr. Carter.
JESSIE CARTER: Thank you to Director Lewis for pointing that out. We had underlined or
highlit in the initial proposal that it had not been completed. But I didn't make the deadline cutoff
for getting the information back from the Title VI department. I have since received that. I can
and will send what was sent to me from Title VI, which definitely says that the review has taken
place and that there are no issues at this point in time. And I will also have the paper corrected.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK. Thank you so much. Director Lewis?
SHONTEL LEWIS: Thank you. Yeah, thank you, Madam Chair.
JESSIE CARTER: Thank you.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Jessie, do you mind just sending that to me via email quickly so that I can
support this tonight? I'd hate to not support it because I don't get that information.
JESSIE CARTER: Director Lewis, I will send that to you momentarily.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Sorry. You kind of broke up. Say that again.

JESSIE CARTER: I'm sorry-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: He will send it to you momentarily.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Sounds good. Thank you.
JESSIE CARTER: Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK, Director Lewis, so-VINCE BUZEK: Buzek.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Go ahead, Director Buzek.
VINCE BUZEK: Thank you, Madam Chair. I would move that the Board of Directors approve
the January 2021 service change package as revised and summarized in attachment A and as
amended by the Title VI analysis and to authorize a General Manager or his designee to execute
contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is impacted by these
changes.
BOB BROOM: Second.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: --Broom, I have a first by Secretary Buzek, a second by Director
Broom. All in favor? I'm going to go through and ask. Director Broom is the movement. Director
Buzek is the second. First Vice Chair Catlin?
PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you, Madam Chair. Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Second Vice Chair Cook.
SHELLEY COOK: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Folska.
CLAUDIA FOLKSA: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Guissinger. Treasurer Guissinger.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Lewis, I'm going to come back to you right after you
get the information with Mr. Carter unless you're ready to vote now.
SHONTEL LEWIS: No, I'm not. Thank you so much.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK, thank you. Director Lubow.

JUDY LUBOW: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Menten.
NATALIE MENTEN: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Mihalik.
KEN MIHALIK: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Tisdale.
DOUG TISDALE: Reliant on the representations made by Jessie Carter relative to the plan
satisfying the equity requirements, I am a Yes vote. Thank you, Madam Chair.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, sir. Director Walker.
JEFF WALKER: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Whitmore.
TROY WHITMORE: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Williams.
KATE WILLIAMS: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: And I am a Yes. Thank you. So that is 14 yeses, one really on
hold.
SHONTEL LEWIS: I got it. He just sent it to me. Thank you. I'm a Yes, Madam Chair.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK, thank you. So that passes unanimously. So that means all of
the unanimous passes forward. So thank you so very much.
There are no recommended actions this evening. And the next thing is, is there any old business
to come before this Board to discuss?
DOUG TISDALE: Madam Chair, if I may, this is Director Tisdale.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Please, sir.
DOUG TISDALE: Thank you very much, Madam Chair. It was an item that did not pass out of
committee last week relative to the proposal that was submitted by Directors Lewis, Tisdale, and
Walker concerning free rides on Election Day. I do want to point out just for the benefit of those
directors who were not able to participate directly in the webinar that was sponsored by the

SWTA Nation today-- that's the South West Transportation Association. The first question on
the webinar that was posed to the attendees was whether their agencies were providing free rides
on Election Day.
There were approximately 81 or so agencies in the Southwest region who were represented on
that webinar, and 72%-- that's 7 2 percent actually said that they offered free rides on Election
Day. And I offer just that information for input and for whatever value it may have with the
acknowledgment that the next general election in two years and the next presidential election in
four years, it may be a consideration that we would wish to take back up. Thank you, Madam
Chair.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, Director Tisdale. Is there any other old business to
come before this Board? Hearing none, does any Director have any new business to discuss
before we proceed into executive session? OK. I will now entertain a motion to move into
executive session pursuant to 24-6-402(4)(c) CRS for the matters required to be kept confidential
by federal or state law or rule regulations and 2-3-103(2) and 2-3-103.7(1) CRS regarding
confidentiality of the audit reports and the recommendation for presentation of a draft audit
finding by the Office of the State Auditor related to the 2021 performance audit.
JUDY LUBOW: So moved.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director-- I'm sorry?
JUDY LUBOW: Lubow.
SHELLEY COOK: And Shelley Cook.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: And Second Vice Chair Cook. All in favor? I'm going to just
say, is there anyone opposed? Hearing none, I'll note for the record that the Board will not
address additional business following the executive session. And would all those entitled to
participate in the executive session please move into the other meeting instance at this time?
