Adoption of the Pension Plan Contribution

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the
RTD Board of Directors adopt a 2021 contribution of $6.1 million to RTD’s Salaried
Employees’ Defined Benefit Pension Trust (the “DB Plan”), which pays a specified
monthly benefit at retirement. It is also recommended that the RTD Board of
Directors adopt a 2021 contribution of 7% of each participant’s eligible
compensation to the Salaried Employees’ Defined Contribution Plan (the “DC Plan”),
which contributes a specified amount to the plan for each year of employment.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Mission-Oriented Goal #3: Strong Financial Management
Strategic Priority #6: Move RTD Toward Stable Financial Situation
B.

Adoption of the 2021 Benefit Plan

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the
Board of Directors approves the 2021 Salaried Benefits plan and authorizes the
General Manager/CEO or his/her designee to enter into agreements with the
insurance carriers.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Mission-Oriented Goal #3: Strong Financial Management
Strategic Priority #6: Move RTD Toward Stable Financial Situation
C.

January 2021 Service Change Proposals Final

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the
Board of Directors approve the January 2021 Service Change package as revised
and summarized in Attachment A and to authorize the General Manager or his
designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators
whose service is impacted by these changes.

The January 2021 service changes are pandemic plan 2, intended to be temporary.
The cuts and changes in this plan and the original pandemic plan will be revisited
by the Board no later than September 2021. In the meanwhile, RTD will establish,
in coordination with local jurisdictions, a documented process for restoring or
restructuring suspended and reduced services. This process will use the January
2020 run board as a baseline, also considering the changes in transit use and
lessons learned in Reimagine RTD and during the pandemic.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #1 - Successful delivery of Transit Service.
D.

Adoption of 2021 Performance Measures

It is recommended by the Operations & Customer Service Committee that the Board
of Directors adopts the attached 2021 Proposed Performance Report and the
accompanying performance measures for mission statement goals 1-7. In 2021,
there are 44 proposed performance measures to be tracked for the GM, which is
two higher than in 2020.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Mission-Oriented Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Service

1.2.1.a

Proclamation in recognition of the contributions made to the
Regional Transportation District (RTD) by

Paul J. Ballard

WHEREAS, the RTD Board of Directors selected Mr. Ballard from among a number of
excellent candidates to serve in the interim as the agency’s GM following the retirement of
David Genova; and
WHEREAS, having served as the president, CEO, or GM of several transit agencies for the
better part of four decades, Mr. Ballard’s wealth of experience uniquely qualified him to
rise to meet RTD’s challenges and opportunities; and
WHEREAS, even though Mr. Ballard’s tenure with RTD began mere weeks before the
effects of the COVID-19 pandemic drastically altered daily life in Colorado and across the
globe, he quickly took the reins and provided sage counsel and operational expertise to
combat the financial and public health threats facing the agency, all while maintaining the
level of service necessary to support first responders and those critically dependent on
public transit; and
WHEREAS, in response to the drastic loss of fare and tax revenue due to the impacts of the
pandemic, Mr. Ballard assembled a task force charged with ensuring the solvency of the
agency in the years to come; and
WHEREAS, in addition to his other duties, Mr. Ballard served as a member of the DRCOG
Regional Transportation Committee and the Ad Hoc Committee on RTD’s Code of Conduct,
and as a trusted advisor to the General Manager Executive Search Committee in its task of
identifying a candidate to serve in the role of GM/CEO on an ongoing basis; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Ballard successfully fulfilled his charge to oversee the completion of the
North Metro Rail Line, which opened for service on September 21, 2020; and
WHEREAS, though he is departing RTD in November 2020, Mr. Ballard’s leadership and
vision has left the agency in a position to succeed in the coming months and years.

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED
BY THE RTD BOARD OF DIRECTORS
That we extend our deepest thanks and commendations to Paul J. Ballard for his tireless
service, leadership, and advocacy during his tenure as RTD’s Chief Executive Officer and
General Manager.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Paul J. Ballard, Interim General Manager and
CEO

From:

Heather McKillop,
Administration

Date:

Subject:

Adoption of the Pension Plan Contribution

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: October 14, 2020
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: October 27, 2020

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
adopt a 2021 contribution of $6.1 million to RTD’s Salaried Employees’ Defined Benefit Pension Trust
(the “DB Plan”), which pays a specified monthly benefit at retirement. It is also recommended that the
RTD Board of Directors adopt a 2021 contribution of 7% of each participant’s eligible compensation to
the Salaried Employees’ Defined Contribution Plan (the “DC Plan”), which contributes a specified amount
to the plan for each year of employment.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Mission-Oriented Goal #3: Strong Financial Management
Strategic Priority #6: Move RTD Toward Stable Financial Situation
BACKGROUND
In December, 2007, the RTD Board of Directors closed the DB Plan to new employees with new
employees hired on January 1, 2008 and later participating in the DC Plan. From January 1, 2008 to
December 31, 2012 both the DB and DC Plan had been funded on a 9% of salaries basis.
DISCUSSION
DB Plan
In 2012, the Board of Directors agreed that beginning in 2013, annual contributions to the DB Plan
would be made at a fixed annual amount of $3.1 million rather than as a percentage of salaries as a
result of the actuary’s recommendation at that time. The fixed annual contribution of $3.1 million to the
DB Plan was determined by the plan’s actuaries to be the annual contribution necessary to maintain a
“fully funded” status for the plan in the future. In 2016, the policy was changed to fund an amount that
would keep the Plan “actuarially sound” based on the recommendations of the Actuary and RTD’s Chief
Financial Officer.
The Actuary has updated the DB Plan projections to reflect the final 1/1/2020 valuation assumptions for
the DB Plan. The 2021 Actuary recommended contribution is $8.6 million.
If the Actuarial
recommendation of $8.6 million is made beginning in 2021, the plan is expected to achieve 100%
funding in 2031 and the recommended amount is projected to drop below $6.1 million in 2032.
Due to financial constraints RTD is currently experiencing, RTD’s Chief Financial Officer is
recommending a contribution of $6.1 million. If RTD contributed $6.1 million in 2021 and beyond, the
Plan is expected to achieve 100% funding in 2043. This also assumes an annual rate of return of 7%
per year.

DC Plan
Section 4.1 of the RTD Salaried Employees’ DC Plan adopted by the RTD Board provides that the
Employer may, at its sole discretion, set a contribution rate between 7 to 9% per year for participants.
The contribution rate has been 9% each year to the DC Plan from 2008 through 2019. However, due to
budgetary constraints, we are recommending a contribution rate of 7% in 2021.

Long-Term Funding
§ The Board’s funding policy (since 2016) remains the same – the contribution is
determined as an amount to keep the Trust “actuarially sound” based on the
recommendations of the Actuary and RTD’s Chief Financial Officer

§ Last meeting (in March), based on January 1, 2019 actuarial valuation results and an
estimated 2019 net investment return of 16.5%, the Plan was projected to reach 100%
funding in 2034 with a $6.1M contribution each year beginning in 2020, if all
assumptions were met in the future, including a net investment return of 7.0%

Ø The Plan was projected to achieve 100% funding (in 2031) if the recommended contribution
was contributed beginning in 2021

§ What changed since last year?
Ø The actual net investment return for 2019 was 16.5% based on the 12/31/2019 Plan audit
Ø The Plan experienced an asset loss of $0.8M (6.4% net return on the Actuarial Value of
Assets vs. 7.0% assumption) and a liability loss of $2.3M during 2019

Long-Term Funding (Continued)
§ Reflecting January 1, 2020 valuation results, the Plan is projected to reach 100%
funding in 2035 with a $6.1M contribution each year if all actuarial assumptions are
met in the future, including a net investment return of 7.0% per year beginning in 2020

§ What happened since the final January 1, 2020 valuation results were issued?
Ø The preliminary YTD investment return through September 2020 is -3.0%, net of investment
expenses, per the investment consultant (vs. the 7.0% assumption)

Long-Term Funding (Continued)
§ Reflecting January 1, 2020 valuation results, a $6.1M contribution in 2020, a -3.0%
preliminary net return on assets in 2020, and assuming all actuarial assumptions are
realized, including a 7.0% net investment return per year beginning in 2021:

Ø If future contributions are equal to $6.1M, the Plan is expected to achieve 100% funding in
2043 and the recommended amount is projected to drop below $6.1M in 2043
q The recommended contribution ranges from $8.6M in 2021 up to $49.2M in 2031 and
decreases down to $3.3M in 2043

Ø If the recommended contribution is made beginning in 2021, the Plan is expected to achieve
100% funding in 2031 (end of the 11-year amortization period) and the recommended
amount is projected to drop below $6.1M in 2032
q The recommended contribution ranges from $8.6M in 2021 up to $9.8M in 2026 and
decreases down to $1.0M in 2032

§ Due to the Plan’s maturity, future investment returns have a significant impact on
projected liabilities – we will keep the Board apprised of the impact of the Plan’s
investment performance on future costs

Adoption of the 2021 Benefit Plan

CFO/AGM,

Date: October 14, 2020
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: October 27, 2020

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approves the 2021 Salaried Benefits plan and authorizes the General Manager/CEO or his/her designee to
enter into agreements with the insurance carriers.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Mission-Oriented Goal #3: Strong Financial Management
Strategic Priority #6: Move RTD Toward Stable Financial Situation
BACKGROUND
Annually the staff brings the proposed Salaried Employee Benefits plan for approval to the Board of
Directors. Approval of the plan by the Board establishes the rates for Open Enrollment and provides
costs for the 2021 Budget. The Open Enrollment period for salaried staff begins November 1 through
November 14, 2020.
DISCUSSION
The goals for the 2021 plan year are: 1) Achieve the 2021 budget goals, 2) Continued focus on
containing cost and emphasis on improving health and wellness consumerism, 3) Maintain market
competitiveness, and 4) Insure compliance with PPACA – Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
(Health Care Reform provisions as applicable to RTD). Following is a summary of the changes for the
2021 plan year.
Based on input from the Board in 2016, the Benefits Committee reviewed the medical premiums and
RTD/ employee share of the premium payment. The Benefits Committee is moving toward the less
expensive plans, Kaiser, as being the base plans to which employees would buy up for Cigna. In year
four, 2021, premiums for participants on the CIGNA HDHP and PPO plans, will be calculated as follows:
•

Cigna participants will pay 80% of the difference in premium between the Cigna plan and a like
Kaiser plan. This is an increase of 10% over the employee premium calculation for 2020.

Medical
• Kaiser HDHP
o No plan changes – 3.8% increase in premium
• Kaiser DHMO
o No plan changes – 3.8% increase in premium
• Cigna HDHP
o No plan changes – 28% increase in premium
• Cigna PPO
o No plan changes – 28.3% increase in premium

Packet Pg. 47

2.11.B

Dental
• The annual premium decreased by 10.2%.
• No change to the Exclusive Panel Option (EPO) Dental Plan and the annual premium decreased by
22.8%.
Due to the decrease in premium and our budget situation, we are recommending that the percent of
premium paid by RTD decrease from 75% to 70% in 2021.
Life & Disability
• Unum is under a rate guarantee – no changes in premium or plan design
Vision/Business Travel Accident
• Superior Vision is under a rate guarantee – no changes in rate or plan design, however the
employee contributions were smoothed resulting in a $3,276 reduction in employer contribution.
• Business Travel Insurance is budgeted/paid on a three-year basis, 2021 is year three of the most
recent contract.
The 2019-2021 rate is $1,900 total for three years, this premium is
approximately $100.00 less than the premium for 2016-2018.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The 2021 planned Salaried Employee Benefit budget is projected to be 3.1% above the 2020 projected
benefit costs. However, this is based on headcount as of September 30, 2020. In addition, we don’t
know how many employees may switch from Cigna to Kaiser based on the employee contribution
increase in cost for Cigna.

The 2021 estimate of the Salaried Employee Health and Welfare Benefits is $11,864,237. This is an
increase of $359,116.
For 2021, these benefit costs are already assumed in the draft 2021 budget presented to the Board on
October 13, 2020.
Note: RTD contributions on self-funded plans are based on actual claims. The number above is based on
2020 estimated claims and current enrolled employees.

January 2021 Service Change Proposals Final

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the January 2021 Service Change package as revised and summarized in Attachment A and to
authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private
operators whose service is impacted by these changes.
The January 2021 service changes are pandemic plan 2, intended to be temporary. The cuts and
changes in this plan and the original pandemic plan will be revisited by the Board no later than
September 2021. In the meanwhile, RTD will establish, in coordination with local jurisdictions, a
documented process for restoring or restructuring suspended and reduced services. This process will
use the January 2020 run board as a baseline, also considering the changes in transit use and lessons
learned in Reimagine RTD and during the pandemic.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #1 - Successful delivery of Transit Service.
DISCUSSION
The proposed January 2021 service adjustments reflect a mix of service enhancements, service
reductions and service suspensions in order to maximize ridership within the very limited resources
available to the District as a result of the financial shortfalls resulting from the COVID induced economic
slowdown. The proposals herein include a mix of service adjustments that represent the redeployment of
current resources available under the COVID 19 service plan. Overall, these proposals redirect resources
from services that are underperforming to services that have passenger capacity challenges due to limits
set by social/physical distancing policies that limit capacity on each RTD vehicle to approximately 30%
of pre-COVID capacity. Additionally, these proposals modify service patterns and levels of service on rail
corridors to more effectively match service to ridership demand. With the anticipated depletion of “Cares
Act” funding, the RTD’s ability to fund the operation of additional “follower” service will be sharply
reduced. This necessitates that services that have retained ridership during the pandemic are adequately
resourced to avoid leaving passengers behind due to capacity requirements. COVID induced reductions
in sales and use tax collections preclude returns to higher Pre-COVID service levels and overall ridership
remains less than half of former levels.

Figure2
As can be seen from the tables and graph above, weekday ridership on local bus service has continued
at levels approximately 45% of pre-COVID levels while ridership on Regional services, Flatiron Flyer
services and light rail services have seen weekday ridership declines of 75%-85%. These ridership
numbers appear to be largely affected by reduced commuter activity and reduced employment center
occupancy. The tables were excerpted from a previous Ridership Restoration report and are provided to
describe changes in system ridership.
It is intended that the service adjustments proposed to the current COVID 19 service plan be adopted as
a distinct change to the initial COVID service plan implemented April 19, 2020, as notable changes are
proposed to both bus and rail services. Leveraging the significant collaborative efforts made by the
Reimagine RTD project, a proposal to optimize RTD Light Rail service patterns are contained herein.
Continued coordination between RTD Systems Planning and Service Development staff has also yielded
alternative service plans and analyses to support proposals that shift resources to route services with
higher utilization from services with very low utilization. It should be noted that many of the routes
proposed for service improvements are routes that serve communities that rely on transit for their travel
needs. These riders often perform essential jobs and have continued to ride during the pandemic. It
should also be noted that alternative services have been considered for services that are proposed for
suspension and are listed in Attachment B of this report.
The guiding principles for proposed routine RTD service changes continue to be:
• Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;

Packet Pg. 52

2.11.C

•
•
•
•
•

The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; and also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
Response to changes in the communities where services are provided

However, given the current economic conditions due to the COVID induced economic slowdown, the
overarching guiding principles for the proposed January 2021 service changes come from the Board
adopted Guiding Principles for COVID-19 Budget Reductions, especially Principle number three (3):
“We will prioritize mobility for people who must depend on transit during the pandemic: we will strive to
maximize mobility during the pandemic for those customers who most depend upon our services to
access essential jobs and their necessities, while also keeping our community activity centers
appropriately connected.”
SUMMARY OF PUBLIC HEARINGS
There were 5 public meetings conducted virtually via Microsoft Teams and Facebook Live between
October 7th and October 12th with 95 participants. Comments and further details from these meetings
have been recorded and are summarized in Attachment H of this report.
CHANGES TO INITIAL RECOMMENDATION
Staff receives input during the public comment process and continues to conduct additional analysis
after the initial service recommendations are communicated to the Board of Directors. Depending on the

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The overall estimated financial impact contained in this proposal is designed to be cost neutral.
EQUITY ANALYSIS
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and
Executive Order 12898 regarding Environmental Justice. In this circular, the FTA requires RTD to
evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that exceed the established major service
change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a disproportionately negative impact on
minority or low-income populations. Our evaluation of the proposed January 2021 service changes has
found no disproportionate burden or disparate impacts.

2.11.C.a

Route 228 – Louisville/ Broomfield
Average weekday ridership is 8 passengers per hour. Maximum passenger level on a trip for
weekday, 6 passengers
It is proposed to reduce Route 228 service span weekdays to 8am – 9pm due to very low
ridership. FlexRide is available within Louisville, Superior, as well as Interlocken/Broomfield
area to provide earlier service. It is also proposed to reduce the service span to 8am – 8pm
Saturdays and to 8am – 6pm Sundays.
Route CS/CV – Pine Junction/Conifer/Denver
Average weekday ridership is 4.3 passengers per hour. Maximum passenger level on a trip
for weekday, 6 passengers
Due to very low ridership, it is proposed to suspend Route CV/CS, between Pine Junction

Route 225/225D/225E – Boulder/ Broomfield via Baseline & US287
Average weekday ridership is 9 passengers per hour. Maximum passenger level on a trip for
weekday, 10 passengers
It is proposed to reduce daily Route 225 service frequency from half-hourly to hourly in the
mid-day, due to low ridership. It is also proposed to reduce the service span to 7am – 8pm
on Saturdays and Sundays.

2.11.C.a

C/D Lines
Due to low ridership in the late evening, and increased ridership in the morning peak, this
proposal adjusts the weekday service span: 30-minute frequency between 4:00 a.m. –
6:00 a.m., a 15-minute frequency between 6:00 a.m. – 10:00 p.m., and a 30-minute
frequency from 10:00 p.m. – 11:00 p.m. Weekend service span would be operated from
4:00 a.m. – 11:00 p.m. with a 30-minute frequency between 4:00 a.m. – 8:00 a.m., 15minute frequency between 8:00 a.m. – 10:00 p.m. and 30-minute frequency between
10:00 p.m. – 11:00 p.m. Change in service span and frequency will accommodate the
increased passenger loads that are occurring in the morning peak that currently under the
COVID plan on a 30-minute frequency during the weekday, reduction in the overall service
span will allow for a larger maintenance window for MOW to do routine maintenance
(currently an hour, this change will allow for a 3.5 hour maintenance window), and minimize
overtime costs. Scheduled meets will occur all day long, instead of just the late evening
between E and D line southbound at I-25 & Broadway to allow for a more efficient transfer
for passengers coming from Denver Union Station (DUS) going to Mineral. Northbound
passengers will only need to wait for 3 minutes to transfer to the E line to reach DUS.
E/F Lines
This proposal consolidates the E and F lines to run the E line pattern of service to DUS from
RidgeGate. The E line has the highest ridership bi-directional peak commute when compared
to any other light rail line pre-COVID. Due to low ridership in the late evening, and increased
demand in the morning peak, it is proposed that the weekday service span be adjusted to
4:00 a.m. – 11:00 p.m. with a 30-minute frequency between 4:00 a.m. – 6:00 a.m., a 15minute frequency between 6:00 a.m. – 10:00 p.m., and a 30-minute frequency from 10:00
p.m. – 11:00 p.m. Weekend service span would also be from 4:00 a.m. – 11:00 p.m. with
a 30-minute frequency between 4:00 a.m. – 8:00 a.m., 15-minute frequency between 8:00
a.m. – 10:00 p.m. and 30-minute frequency between 10:00 p.m. – 11:00 p.m. The effort
in changing service span and frequency will accommodate the increased passenger loads
that are occurring in the morning peak. The proposed reduction of the overall service span
will allow for a larger maintenance window for maintenance (currently an hour, this change
will allow for a 3.5 hour maintenance window), and reduce overtime costs. Proposed
adjustments to the schedule would support all-day scheduled meets between E and D line
southbound at I-25 & Broadway to allow for a more efficient transfer for passengers coming
from Central Downtown Denver destined to RidgeGate Parkway. Northbound passengers
will only need to wait for 3-6 minutes at I-25 & Broadway to transfer to the D or H lines to
the Central Downtown area.
H line
Due to low ridership in the late evening, and increased demand for capacity during the
morning weekday peak, recommend adjusting the service span to be consistent with the D
and E lines. Adjust weekday service span will be from 4:00 a.m. – 11:00 p.m. with a 30minute frequency between 4:00 a.m. – 6:00 a.m., a 15-minute frequency between 6:00
a.m. – 10:00 p.m., and a 30-minute frequency from 10:00 p.m. – 11:00 p.m. Weekend
service span will be from 4:00 a.m. – 11:00 p.m. with a 30-minute frequency between 4:00
a.m. – 8:00 a.m., 15-minute frequency between 8:00 a.m. – 10:00 p.m. and 30-minute
frequency between 10:00 p.m. – 11:00 p.m. Change in service span and frequency will

accommodate the increased passenger loads that are occurring in the weekday morning
peak that currently under the COVID plan running on a 30-minute frequency during the
weekday, will also allow for a larger maintenance window for MOW to do routine
maintenance (currently an hour, this change will allow for a 3.5 hour maintenance window),
and reduce overtime costs.

R line
Recommend adopting the Reimagine RTD rail plan by recommending shifting the
southernmost terminal from RidgeGate to Lincoln due to low demand south of Lincoln with
a service span of 4:00 a.m. – 11:00 p.m. on a 30-minute frequency for weekday and
weekend. Change in service span will allow for a larger maintenance window for MOW to
do routine maintenance (currently an hour, this change will allow for a 3.5-hour maintenance
window), and minimize overtime costs.
W line
Due to low ridership in the evening and increased capacity demands during the weekday
morning peak, recommend adjusting the service span to be from 4:00 a.m. – 11:00 p.m.
Weekday frequency between Jeffco Government Center to DUS 30-minute frequency
between 4:00 a.m. – 11:00 p.m., and 30-minute frequency between Fed Center to DUS
between 6:00 a.m. – 10:00 p.m., creating a combined frequency of 15-minutes between
the Fed Center and DUS to address capacity concerns under the current COVID plan.
Weekend service span would be 30-minute frequency between Jeffco Government Center
to DUS 4:00 a.m. – 11:00 p.m., and 30 minute frequency between Fed Center and DUS
between 8:00 a.m. – 10:00 p.m., creating a combined frequency of 15-minutes between
Fed Center and DUS between 8:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. Change in service span and
frequency will accommodate the increased passenger loads that are occurring in the morning
peak that currently under the COVID plan is only running on a 30 minute frequency, allow
for a larger maintenance window for MOW to do routine maintenance (currently an hour,
this change will allow for a 3.5 hour maintenance window), minimize the need to pay
operators overtime which is usually over $1M each year.

Regional Routes
During the 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic, ridership on Regional bus routes has fared comparatively worse
than other services offered by RTD. Even at reduced service levels, some operating routes are carrying 3
to 5 passengers per trip on routes of 25 to 40 miles in length. These poorly performing Regional routes
are:
CV – Pine Junction/Conifer – Denver
EV – Evergreen – Denver
GS – Golden – Boulder
Recognizing that travel patterns will not return to normal as people with the ability to work from home,
the vast majority of Regional passengers, will continue to do so, several options are being considered for
how to more cost-effectively serve these remaining Regional passengers. While passengers need the
mobility currently offered by RTD bus service, continuing to run full-size buses to accommodate a few
passengers is not a cost-effective or efficient use of RTD’s resources. Options being considered include:
vanpools/carpools; ride-hailing, e.g., taxi, Lyft; and RTD FlexRide or Access-a-Ride.
Vanpool service refers to a group of passengers with similar origins and destinations driving together in a
van provided and maintained by the DRCOG waytogo program and partially funded by RTD.
Advantages of this option include:
o Drivers are not paid, thus relatively low cost
o No deadhead, as vehicles remain with the driver
o Capacity in one van sufficient for each bus trip at current ridership, and flexible for additional
passengers
o Convenient trips for passengers — Vehicles would not need to stop at all bus stops along the
route and potential for passenger pickup/drop-off at home or work.
Challenges of this option include:
o One passenger must volunteer as the driver and also a backup driver needed
o Willingness of passengers to share a vehicle under COVID conditions

Alternative Service Considerations for Suspended Fixed-Routes
January 2021 Proposal

2.11.C.b
Attachment B

Can operate only upon passenger request, thus reduce costs relative to a fixed-scheduled bus
when demand is lower (e.g., Friday, holidays)
o Convenient trips for passengers — Vehicles would not need stop at all bus stops along the route;
potential for passenger pickup/drop-off at home or work.
Challenges of this option include:
o Vehicles are typically not ADA accessible. RTD would need to provide Access-a-Ride if requested
by a passenger to keep the service equivalent to present bus service, though this is not required
for Regional service.
o Willingness of passengers to share a vehicle under COVID conditions likely limits usage to one
passenger per vehicle, requiring multiple vehicles for each bus trip, increasing costs
o In ride-hail model the driver is not paid for deadhead time and these routes would likely require
significant deadheading, making them less attractive to drivers and less reliable to passengers.
Could be mitigated through a subscription model.
o If the service proves to be popular and attracts additional passengers, costs can rise significantly
Ride-hailing Cost
Prevailing rates apply and an individual ride is required for each rider. An estimate is $25 for a 25-mile
trip or (probably) more.
RTD FlexRide or Access-a-Ride operated could offer two operating options:
o Operating the full Regional route with smaller, more efficient vehicles
o Operating a truncated route to connect passengers with the RTD system without going all the way
to Downtown Denver. This is similar to a FlexRide as a first and last mile solution, but covers a
much longer distance.
Access-a-Ride currently has capacity to operate additional trips and meets ADA requirements. It could
provide a general public service, acting like a FlexRide anywhere in the metro area. FlexRide typically
operate in small service zones and may not achieve the same efficiencies as operating this kind of service
with Access-a-Ride.
Benefits of operating RTD Access-a-Ride include:
o Lower hourly operating cost
o Potential for less deadhead and service hours and cost by truncating route at a station
o Utilizing available capacity in Access-a-Ride
Challenges of operating RTD Access-a-Rdie include:
o Requires a vehicle and operator provided by RTD
o Passenger willingness to ride in a smaller vehicle with other passengers due to COVID concerns
o Longer travel time passenger trips If route is truncated to connect with RTD system prior to
Downtown Denver
o Truncating Route GS is not a viable option due to already only having potential connections at its
endpoints
Access-a-Ride Weekday Alternative Cost
CV (current service, but operated by AaR) – $637
CV (between Fed Center and Pine Junction, operated by AaR) - $582
EV (current service, but operated by AaR) – $517

Attachment B

In addition to the routes stated previously, there has been requests from passengers to provide service
on the following routes that were suspended entirely due to COVID-19:
116X – South Simms Express
P – Parker – Denver
Y – Lyons – Boulder
The alternative delivery options outlined in this document could also be applied to these routes, though
Route Y is similar to Route GS in that is does not have a good connection point to the rest of the system
other than at its current south end in Boulder. Boulder County is currently providing taxi vouchers to
residents of Lyons for travel to Boulder or Longmont. Additionally, Route P may be better served as a
local feeder service due to the proximity of existing rail service at Lincoln Station to most of the boarding
passengers. This can be better addressed when looking at providing alternatives to low-performing local
services.
Local Routes
During the 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic several local routes were completely or partially suspended in April
2020 due to projected low ridership. As essential workers have traveled throughout the pandemic and
businesses have reopened more recently, requests for service on some suspended routes have been
communicated to RTD. Routes and options for providing service to these areas are the following:
Route 99 – South Kipling
Service has been frequently requested from passengers between Federal Center Station and the US285/Hampden Ave area. Options considered are:
o Operate hourly service on the full Route 99 between Federal Center Station and Southwest Plaza
- Serves the entire route at fixed, regular schedule
- Continues to provide service to low-demand areas that have not requested it
- Cost of three buses and operators
o Operate hourly service on a truncated Route 99 between Federal Center Station and US285/Hampden Ave
- Serves the in-demand portion of the route at fixed, regular schedule
- Cost of one bus and operator
o FlexRide
- Serves area on-demand and may have scheduled timepoints
- Cost of a bus and operator but at lower cost than bus
- Zone would be very large to cover all passengers and connect to Federal Center Station,
reducing reliability
128 – 128th Ave
Service has been requested in Broomfield on Route 128. Most of this area is currently covered by the
Broomfield FlexRide and also the Broomfield Easy Ride. Options considered are extending one or both.
RTD will work with the municipality and passengers to better communicate the options available in this
area. FlexRide currently covers the area and has capacity.
Route 483 – Parker Rd/Lincoln Ave and Route P – Parker/Denver

2.11.C.b

Service has been requested from the Parker area to connect with the rest of the RTD system. The Parker
FlexRide currently operates but does not currently connect with the transit network. Options considered
are:
o 75-minute service on a truncated Route 483 between Lincoln Station and Parker Park-n-Ride
- Serves the in-demand portion of the route at fixed, regular schedule
- Cycle time prevents more frequent service
- Cost of one bus and operator
o Extension of Parker FlexRide to provide service to Lincoln Station
- Could operate as a demand responsive service or a deviated fixed route
- Cost of one additional bus and operator, but at lower cost than a bus
125 – Youngfield/Ward
Service has been requested for the portion of Route 125 between Federal Center Station and Red Rocks
Community College. The options considered is to extend the coverage zone for the Green Mountain
FlexRide to cover Red Rocks Community College. The FlexRide zone is adjacent to the college and this
requires no additional resources.
Utilizing other demand-responsive services such as taxis, Uber, and Lyft, were examined but are not
recommended due to challenges related to providing ADA accessible service. Third parties providing
service in non-accessible vehicles require accessible vehicles be available from RTD to serve disabled
passengers and will generally offer one vehicle per passenger trip. Furthermore, it is difficult to attract
drivers to attract drivers to provide these trips for reliable service. The cost of having these accessible
vehicles on standby negates any efficiencies gained by providing trips with third-party non-accessible
operators. RTD is currently conducting a pilot program that allows for accessible trips to be provided in
conjunction with other trips operated by non-accessible vehicles. Should this prove successful and
scalable, it may be possible to implement on a larger scale across the district.

Need to have the 206 return in Boulder

We have been supporting Neighborhood EcoPasses the last 10 years even though we use the bus less than the cost of
an Ecopass. We did this to keep the program alive. And now our daughter just started 6th grade and we were
planning to have her take the 206 route in Boulder to her middle school. I understand why the 206 was cut
at the beginning of the pandemic and I believe it was the right decision. However, schools are now starting back
up and the 206 gets neighborhood kids to 2 different middle schools and Fairview High School. Now that the
students are going back to school it is time to start the 206 again.
Sincerely,
Martha Kendall

Do not discontinue the CV route. You have a 15 passenger maximum and are encouraging low ridership. Lift the
maximum limit and passengers will ride.

Planned 205 Heatherwood cancellation

Hello,
I'm a Gunbarrel Estates resident who has for years relied upon, and continue to rely upon, the Heatherwood branch of
the 205 to get to and from Boulder. I and many people in my area took the 205 to get to CU Boulder for school every
day, and after graduation I continued to ride for medical appointments.
While I understand the budget constraints facing RTD, especially with the COVID‐19 pandemic restricting public transit
ridership for health and safety reasons, this route change will have a negative impact on the lives of west Gunbarrel
residents. I would ask that, at the least, RTD consider reestablishing this leg of the route in the future, when the
pandemic is sufficiently under control that students and workers will be able to safely resume the activities that take
them to Boulder.
Thank you for your time,
Anya Thurmes

I have heard the 205 service may change. I ride it and see people everyday using it from my neighborhood. Please
continue service and if necessary in the short term, only reduce frequency. Gunbarrel has many lower income residence

Please do not suspend CV bus in 2021 for commuters

Yes there was low ridership over the summer, but there are many of us using the only 2 remaining CV buses this
fall. The RTD max is 15‐20 riders and at least 11 of us were riding home the 4:24pm on October 1. This is huge burden
on those of us who have relied on Mon‐Friday CV bus service for many years.
I urge you to reconsider and attempt to at least operate 1‐2 buses for commuters from Pine Junction to Denver Civic

Please do not start eliminating commuter routes for those still having to go downtown to their jobs despite Covid‐19.

To operate the most productive, efficient transit system for the communities we serve, we make changes to
our bus and rail system three times a year. We propose the following service changes to take effect on
January 10, 2021.
CV/CS: Due to very low ridership, it is proposed to suspend Route CV/CS between Pine Junction and
Denver, replacing it with an RTD-paid Uber/Lyft service partnership and/or taxi voucher program.
Consideration should also be given to DRCOG-coordinated carpool and vanpool options.
Attend a virtual meeting about proposed service changes or email service.changes@rtd-denver.com no
later than October 14, 2020. You may also fax your comments to 303.299.2227.

Please do not suspend Regional CV route in 2021

Could RTD please reconsider suspending the CV route in January 2021, so those who have ridden the bus to Denver area
jobs could continue to use it. If there is temporary reduction, could at least the 6:35am bus eastbound be retained?
Riding in small Uber car or shared van is concerning during COVID‐19 ‐ plus Colorado winters which many drivers are not
equipped to handle well on 285 foothills. This is not acceptable alternative during a pandemic.
We had 9‐10 riders each way today (RTD max is 15 right now on single bus) so even combining the 2 remaining buses
would likely put ridership at current max limits.
Most riders are very concerned if buses suspended in mountain communities (conifer and evergreen) they will not likely
return for years. We urge you to reconsider.
Thank you, T. Gale

Proposed changes to Route 205

I am writing to express my serious concerns about the proposed change to Route 205 in Boulder.
The Heatherwood Loop at the end of this route is an essential service for many in our
neighborhood, and dropping this section of the route is really unacceptable. My teenage daughter
uses this route often to get home, and eliminating this portion would put her safety at risk, along
with the safety of other teens who depend on this section.
In addition to high school and college students, the Heatherwood loop serves people traveling to
and from work, several blind residents, as well as many senior citizens. There are no other bus
routes within miles of Heatherwood, and there are no other options besides paying exorbitant prices
for Uber or LYFT. Over the years, RTD has cut this route by 50% during the non-peak hours. Basic
bus service through Heatherwood is essential and already runs at a frequency that is barely
functional. The service must, at a bare minimum, remain in place.
RTD must look at other ways to address their budget shortfalls than cutting routes which people
depend on for their participation in society.
Thank you in advance for taking this proposed change off the table.
Sincerely,
Heidi Alina
Heatherwood Resident and Boulder native

Proposed changes to route 225, Lafayette

I’m writing to request you reconsider changing the frequency of the bus service for route 225. I understand the current
ridership doesn’t warrant the 30 minute schedule. However, once BVSD schools are back in session, many students will
need this bus route to get to and from their schools, homes, and workplaces. This route services Peak to Peak, Platt and
Platt Choice, Douglas Elementary, New Vista, and Fairview, among others. Because of the block schedules, students
don’t come and go only at set morning and afternoon times, but often need to catch the bus during the middle of the
day for open lunch, off periods, and to go to classes at other schools or CU, not to mention internships and paid
employment.
Please don’t let this strange time limit what’s available once we are able to be out and about. And, if it makes sense to
change the schedule now, please make provisions to re‐open the routes and provide more regular schedule once the
world is back on a more typical schedule.
Thank you for your time and kind consideration.

Proposed D Line changes

I am strongly in favor of the proposed D‐Line changes.
As a 6 day/week, car‐less commuter between Evans station and Convention/Theatre, I regularly leave downtown
between 10‐10:30 pm. The loss of this line affected me tremendously. The reliability of a transfer from downtown to
the C line at Broadway is low enough to cause anxiety. Additionally, there is no substantial shelter at any of the 3 stops
one could make this transfer at. (The minor exception being Broadway, which is still very open and you run the risk that
a northbound train could cause you to miss the southbound C line.)
Another issue with the current D‐Line reduction is that all Southbound patrons must travel through the campus, and at
times, the trains can become unsafely overcrowded as the traffic has not been distributed. All of these problems have
caused me tremendous amounts of inconvenience and I have often had to resort to ridesharing if it is simply too late to
catch a train considering the low frequency of trips at this time.
In consideration for the Theatre traffic (Pre COVID at least), there were often riders out waiting for, even missing the
last train of the evening, and were often confused and dismayed at the situation. I heard many claim they will not use
RTD again for this simple reason. Additional service extensions until midnight would be a tremendous convenience and
a fantastic safety measure, but perhaps too much of a luxury for budgetary concerns.
We all understand the current situation and revenue concerns, but I have heard no positive reactions or anecdotes to
the service reductions, and I interact with a lot of D‐Line and H‐Line commuters and first‐timers. It seems backwards to
continue this reduction as traffic begins to return. Patrons will already be wary to use public transit, and the levels of
discomfort caused by the current D‐Line reduction could cause even long time commuters to seek alternatives.
I believe it is a wise choice to reinstate the D‐Line schedule as proposed. Any other action could be detrimental to the
future of the Light Rail system by grass‐root abandonment. Your core customers want this! Give it to us!
Thank you for your time,
8 year daily commuter

Proposed RTD Service Changes

I hope you're doing well. I'm emailing you regarding plans to discontinue the Route 205 bus line between Lookout
Rd/Gunpark and Heatherwood/Devonshire. I understand that funds are tight, and I know the 205 doesn't get as much
traffic as some of the other lines, but if at all possible, please don't discontinue it. If nothing else, could you decrease the
frequency, stop it over the winter, or just temporarily halt it during the pandemic instead? The 205 is the only method I
have to reach Walden ponds and my friends in Gunbarrel ‐‐ both of which are very precious to me. I also know people
who use it to get to work every day in the summer too. They'd lose their jobs without it.
That being said, there are people who rely on other bus lines for employment, as well, and if it comes down to the 205
or the FF1, for instance, obviously you should chose the latter. If there's any chance of saving the 205, though, please do.
There might not be many people who use it, but it means a lot to the people that do.

Best regards,
Ellie Bowers

Re: Please don't stop the 205 service to Heatherwood and Gunbarrel

Thank you for writing with these concerns. I have heard from other Heatherwood neighbors as well. I am
forwarding all of the emails that I receive to RTD's service planning staff and will discuss the concerns with the
proposed change with them.
We at RTD hate having to cut service. Right now, though, ridership is only about 40% of its pre‐
Covid.numbers, which is causing serious budget problems. The Heatherwood route has very few riders,
especially during the pandemic. The service team will verify ridership, and I will work with them to consider
the options.
In addition, there are still three virtual public meetings where you can ask questions to staff and express your
concerns. The meetings are listed below. I encourage you and others to try to attend. Changes can still be
made, often based on the comments from these meetings and emails. I will attend the Facebook Live event

Subject: RTD Route 205

I am a resident living in the Twin Lakes neighborhood and it has come to my attention that the Heatherwood loop may
be completely cancelled from this route. This change would not affect me personally, as I am privileged with a car,
license and also a bike that I usually ride everywhere.
I am writing to express my serious concerns to the proposed change to Route 205 in Boulder. RTD is proposing to drop
the Heatherwood Loop off the end of this route. There are at least two totally blind residents, living in two separate
dwellings in that area and who depend on RTD for transportation. If you cut this service, they will have to get to 75th to
catch the bus.
The Heatherwood loop serves numerous commuters and senior citizens.The concern is that there are no other methods
of public transportation in that area. The frequency of stops has already been diminished a fair amount. I believe
completely cutting the route is detrimental for those who do not have a car or choose not to drive.
I ride my bike almost everywhere and the removal of the route may not significantly impact me personally, but I know
numerous people who cannot simply start riding their bike or driving their car. In the winter I usually try to take the bus
at least 2 or 3 times a week to avoid contributing to car traffic on the road.
I don't have an answer for solving budget issues. If I were the lawmaker, I would happily pay more tax money to sustain
the public transportation. I believe it is going to be even more important in the future for us to rely on public
transportation, instead of cars. I will fight for RTD and ample access to public transportation, even if it does not affect
me personally.

Christina

Hi,
I have been riding your buses and light rail, etc. for the last 54 years and because of that I do not have access to a car,
nor do I want one because you guys are so fantastic!!!!
If I might suggest that because of the pandemic and your budget short fall why not run ALL of the routes in the
Boulder ‐ Denver/Metro areas at least every hour or half hour 7 days a week. Including the Flatiron Flyer....
It would be really nice if you would return the 32 route so that it goes to the Denver Museum of Nature and Science
and the Denver Zoo.
And many thanks for bringing the south bound 204 back during the week, every hour ‐ really do appreciate it as I use
it to get to King Soopers and back, and during winter/bad weather it will be much more used for that!!!!!
Thank you very much for all you do for us passengers, especially the ones who don't have cars (like me), are elderly,
or handicapped, students, etc.
I really do appreciate the email updates you send to us also, keep them coming!
Please take care and keep safe...

sad about Route 205 discontinuation :-(

I am writing to express disappointment upon hearing that Route 205 east of Lookout/Gunpark might be discontinued.
My family lives at 75th St and Clubhouse Rd and would be affected.
While some cuts are inevitable given coronavirus and the economy, our hope that the proposed route 205
discontinuation would be only temporary, signage would be left up (perhaps with "temporary discontinuation" stickers),
and that service would eventually be reinstated. Given that our route is "low ridership" compared to other routes with
"very low ridership" on https://www.rtd‐denver.com/service‐changes/january‐2021, we hope that route 205 could be
near the front of line when deciding which services comes back.

Support not changing the L Line schedule this service change

I would like to thank you for not proposing to reduce L Line service this schedule change, when reductions
have been proposed for other light rail line. The L Line's span of 15‐minute service ‐ roughly 9 am to 7 pm ‐ is
already shorter than the corresponding spans being proposed with this service change ‐ 6 am to 10 pm. It
strikes me as unusual that the L Line gets less service despite it being RTD's least‐subsidized (per boarding) rail
line.

I have been speaking to you about this for some time now. I live at Mexico an Chambers in Aurora for United airlines
working at DIA. I have no service but nine mile. I have no car, so now I am forced at 60yrs old to leave at 2am for a 5 mile
walk to 9 mile. Everything else forces me to take the train and I would be late everyday. We have no early morning bus
to get us to the train station. Plus connections time are just to short. Most times coming and going you have less then 4
minutes to make the 169 out 40th , the morning 169 right now only gives me 3 minutes to make the train. Same with the
153. The trains give us short periods. One real big thing no one cares about we have at a time 6, 000 employees going to
work on a morning shift. The system is not timed for that. To be honest that is why DIA EMPLOYEES DRIVE IN, THE
TIMING OF THE SYSTEM! TO MANY TIME STUCK ON A LINE!!! The A line feels like the care is for visitors to union Station.
200 dollars a month for poor service.
I shouldn't have to walk 5 miles at 2am for a 6am start with my job!
We had the 169L for almost 20yrs 40 people everyday at 5am. Never had a issue, same drivers it was great 👍.
But now, out of control. The A line is a big problem . I am a logistics specialist with united. Moving united states mail
around. So I do understand the facts. You have to rebuild. To much down time with drivers. Sit around for 30 minutes
and then leave 10 minutes late?
Seen a bus seating on a street by apartment no one around, a side street on Chambers the other day?
You need undercovers to just watch system. Includes your supervisors.
It is amazing the stories I have heard over the years about them. Problem in all departments. Clean sweep on all
levels, reorganization is called for.

operating hours were further constrained in September.
There are myriad bus lines that operate every 15 or 30 minutes, but the 72 only runs every hour; more
egregiously, it has ceased operations before 8AM, eliminating its utility for many who must leave for work
before then. We as a community need our public services now more than ever to be run as a necessary public
good rather than as a for-profit business that ignores the needs of the people. I highly encourage that the 72 be
returned to a functional schedule.
Thank you,

D Line Service Changes

I would just like to voice my support for the Jan. 2021 service change that would resume service on the D line to/from
Mineral. I know many people who work on the Southeast side of Downtown who stopped riding light rail not because of
COVID, but because of the long time involved with taking the C line and then trying to transfer to the H line. I would
anticipate many of those folks will be taking advantage of the D line once it resumes.
Thank you,
Andrew Pitts

CV/CS Proposed Route Change

Many of us living in the foothills who work in Denver are concerned about the proposal to suspend Route CV/CS
between Pine Junction and Denver.
The stated reason for the proposed change – very low ridership – should be considered in the context of the COVID‐19
pandemic. Prior to March, the CV/CS route buses were consistently full. Regardless of which bus I caught, it was almost
always full. With the pandemic and significant moves to work from home and remote work options, ridership
understandably dropped. Oftentimes, despite a reduced number of daily routes, there would be 3‐5 passengers on the
buses. Recently, however, there has been an uptick in passengers. That trend toward increased riders will likely continue
as more employers return to “normal” operations, or at least modified operations that rely less on remote work.
For the environment and to avoid the high cost of downtown parking, many of us rely on RTD to safely and economically
get to work. Rather than suspend Route CV/CS, the better option would be to continue with the reduced route schedule
until such time as sufficient ridership warrants expanding the route options. At a minimum, RTD should defer a
suspension determination until it is able to evaluate ridership levels post‐pandemic. Otherwise, suspending service while
so many are still struggling imposes an additional, economically‐crippling burden.
I appreciate the opportunity to express my and my neighbors’ concerns.

Comment on proposed service changes -lines CV/EV

Thank you for the public comments opportunity.
Tough choices are needing to be made, I understand this.
I ride the CV bus from Pine Junction to Civic center station daily for work. I'm essential personnel in Denver.
While the bus isn't full, in the last month, ridership has doubled , going from 5 to 10 now most days. 10 is a good load
with social distancing. I suspect it will only continue to rise as more folks get back you work in person.
This is both mornings and afternoons . Seeing the afternoon riders for EV I assume this is the case for that line too
Please consider leaving at least one service time running for the CV line . There's many of us living in the 285 corridor
that rely on the bus for work. Leaving the 6:34am service and 4:24pm service running fits most people schedules and
isn't entirely stopping service.
Maybe to offset keeping CV EV running on one time, 16th Street Mall ride bus could go entirely too 15 mins times? Or as
I used to ride the FF7 maybe one less FF7 run could offset CV EV staying running?
Rather than just complain, I wanted to offer some solutions along with my concerns.
Best and I'm a big fan of riding RTD
Always

comment on service changes

I utilize wagon road park n ride to take bus downtown. I normally would take the 122x as my place of business is much
closer to civic center station. With the current reductions my commute has increased over 30 minutes each way due to
having to wait for a mall ride or timing a 0 bus or just walking due to only having the 120x as an option.
Is there any possibility of restoring some 122x routes or the metro running again or some hybrid where the 120x drops
off at union and also goes on to civic center station? Why not have the option of extending the 120x route to have an
additonal stop/travel to civic center station?
Right now the mall ride does not run frequently enough during work starting hours (630‐730am) so it's not as feasible an
option.

Limiting hours mid day to hourly would not effect my schedule to and from work.
I really have been inconvenienced with no early AM bus to connect me to the LD3 from the 225. If an earlier bus could
be offered out of boulder to Lafayette, it would provide more persons access to a regional bus to get to Longmont from
Lafayette.
Also, the first LD3 runs rather late to get persons to work...not getting into Longmont till 8 AM makes me late for work

Conifer Bus Route

My name is Kelly and I wanted to write my concerns about discontinuing the Conifer (and Evergreen) bus route.
While I understand that cuts need to be made, many people in the mountains do not have an alternative. Once people
are allowed to go back to work in the Denver downtown area, I do not think the Lyft‐carpool solution will be sufficient. I
am worried that when we go back down into Denver for in‐person work, RTD won't be there to make it possible for us to
travel and it would be too difficult to get the bus route back once it has been discontinued. There is not any sort of bus
service in that area and no other alternatives.
Please consider not ending this bus route and decreasing resources in other bus routes where people at least have other
options.
Thank you for your consideration,
Kelly Breslin

Covid response feedback

I'm writing this because it would appear your asking for feedback on your response to the COVID crisis.
As a student I have to say I'm incredibly disappointed in your decisions. I currently attend Community College of Denver
and prior to this quarantine you partnered with them to offer affordable transit options to students with the fee coming
directly from our student account. As most students needs changed during the pandemic, CCD made the choice to
suspend their partnership which would have forced all students to pay for an RTD pass they likely wouldn't have needed.
My program does however still require me to come to campus daily and when the college reached out to you requesting
an opt‐in program for affected students you said no.
This choice to deny introduction of a temporary opt‐in program for the Collegepass card has greatly impacted my
financial situation for these quarantined semesters. It has forced me to take the cheaper option of driving a personal
vehicle to school and work increasing my environmental impact and adding one more vehicle to the already problematic
issue of Denver traffic.
The simple fact is being a student during COVID is already hard and the choices your institution has made during this
crisis has made it even harder

Crowding issue

Thanks for working on solutions in difficult times.
While you're considering high use routes, could you PLEASE see if something can be done about the weekday morning
Mallride in the 06:30 to 07:00am period? For weeks now, all busses, at least EB from DUS, have without exception been
carrying at least 25 people. Many of us depend on this to get to work, (especially as walking the Mall seems more risky
at that time of day, every day) waiting for a next bus, or trying to get an earlier one cannot be an option for us, because
so many employers not do not allow employees to enter their business early.
This is of course only going to increase as the weather gets colder. A significant number of us are seniors, so crowding
risks become very pertinent.
Thanks again for your work.
Sincerely,
Carol Young

CS/CV suspension

I write to you today to urge the RTD Board to reconsider the plan to cut off the foothill community from our daily bus
service. The idea that we will be able to use and rely on Uber/Lyft or a taxi to get to/from work is completely ridiculous
unless RTD is now going to create & fund this "new" Uber/Lyft/taxi program.
I am an essential worker who relies on public transportation to get to/from work and will never have the luxury to work
from home.
Ridership increases due to winter weather and Covid restrictions will not last forever. Many people have already been
told they need to return to the office starting Jan 1. The other households who will return to work and school after the
New Year will be blindsided because the bus service is now gone.
I am interested to know what your plan is to determine the rider‐need if you completely shut down the service. The
struggle it took to get RTD to service the 285 corridor was no easy task and it feels like this is being done at a time when
the least amount of people are aware of the change so they cannot voice their opinion.
We need to keep the CS/CV route in place!
Sincerely,
Jason

D Train instead of C Train

You can not change the C train to the D train without a public restroom in central downtown! For the last 6 months, I
can't find anywhere with a public restroom in the downtown area except Civic Center station (weekdays until 7pm only),
and Union Station that are still open to the public. Someone told me to go to Pavilions, but you need a code to get in
there. And Starbucks closed all their bathrooms. CVS and Walgreens and TJ Max and Ross haven't had public restrooms
in years. I take water pills for high blood pressure along with a large portion of senior citizens, and this causes one to
have to urinate often and suddenly. With nowhere to go to the restroom between bus trip and train trip, I can not leave
my house to go shopping. I use the C train to go to Walmart in Englewood by switching from bus coming from west side
of downtown. I will no longer be able to shop at Englewood Station if I have no restroom to use in between. At least if I
switch to C train from bus, Union Station is right there. There are way more residences near Union Station than 16th and
Stout anyway. Noone is working in the Office Buildings, so why do you need the train to go there? I don't know of any
more people going to central downtown except protesters. Noone is going to Convention Center and most of the hotels
are empty.
Please reconsider switching from C train to D train only and keep the C train running into Union Station as it does now.
Thank You,

Don't eliminate the CV Route

This route provides vital access to high paying jobs in Denver so that the economic growth along 285 is maintained. I love
riding the bus in the winter; it’s cozy to be on a dark bus in the morning with a coffee and headphones. Replacing it with
Lyft/Uber increases the amount of cars on the road and then we are in some yahoo amateur’s car in likely adverse
weather conditions.
Reducing service to vans would put us all in closer quarters. Crazed mountain folk don’t do well in close quarters to other
folk.
Consider shortening the route to the Mountain View pickup location instead of going all the way to Pine Junction.
I purchase a $200 monthly pass for this route; but haven’t been riding lately due to the local gov. response to the virus.
Thanks,
Jarod

EV Bus Route

I would like to oppose the discontinuation of the EV bus route. I have been a regular commuter on this route
for over 5 years. Not only would paying for parking downtown be a financial burden, but also the negative
impact on traffic and the environment are not in the best interest of our community.
Wondering if a compromise would be to run the bus from the Morrison stop only. CV and EV commuters
could easily meet at that location and run a combined route to the Civic Center.
Please reconsider this decision that would be detrimental to Evergreen and Denver in general.
Thank you,

EV Route Discontinuation

Dear RTD:

Pre‐Covid I would take the 6:00 a.m. EV bus from Evergreen to Denver Civic Center. I work for the federal government and we are
on Phase 1 of coming back to the office. Before Phase 1, we were on max telework. I am concerned that bus service will stop
starting in January 2021. By January 2021, my office could be in Phase 2 or even Phase 3 (full return of all staff to the office). Of
course, it will all depend on the pandemic in CO. Pre‐Covid, RTD is my only source of transportation – a family member drops me off
at the bus stop and uses the car during the day to get to and from school. I would appreciate at least one early morning and an
afternoon EV bus to and from Denver in January 2021. Otherwise, I will have to purchase a car and drive downtown.
QUESTIONS:



Will the EX bus still operate? If so, will there be an early morning EX bus that gets me to downtown BEFORE 7:00 a.m.?
I looked on the link in the email I got from RTD and I did not see detailed information about the Uber Lyft partnership
and/or taxi voucher program. Will that work with my Eco‐Pass if the EV bus is discontinued? Do you have to meet the
service at a bus stop or do they come to your home?

EV Route

As the company I work for pays for this service (Ecopass), as do I through my taxes, I am concerned about losing this
route. Due to my work schedule, I take the early bus into Denver and the late bus going home. The ridership seems to
be increasing and I expect it will continue to. More options would be nice, as opposed to fewer. Can you guys look at a

EV/ES route cancellation

Hi,
I'm a state employee who rode the EV/ES route daily to Capitol Hill prior to COVID. I've paid for an annual pass that is
good through the end of the year, despite not riding the bus since the pandemic began. I intend to go back to riding the
bus, and others who are currently working from home do, too. Many, many people have moved to Evergreen in the last
10 years‐‐the recent census puts the number at 40,000, a 4‐fold increase in a decade. The demand will continue to be
there post‐pandemic. Please reconsider canceling the route entirely and consider going down to 1‐2 buses a day to
weather the pandemic.
Thanks,
Gina Cannan

Input on RTD changes

As a student living in Boulder, I find that the bus lines that are most important to me are the AB(to fly to see my family,
ubers are expensive from boulder to DIA), and the NB to enjoy the mountains and go snowboarding when able.
I don't use the RTD to commute, but I feel these lines are key to being able to fully appreciate living in the Colorado
Boulder area.

reducing service has created the financial shortfall. it is your own fault. In Europe they don't limit the number of people

Feedback on proposed schedule change: Route 20

I was distressed to hear about your proposed changes to the Saturday and Sunday schedule for route 20. I rely on this
route to get to work on Sundays, and many people in our community also rely on this route to provide transit to the
Denver Museum of Nature and Science and the Denver Zoo. Cutting service to such an inconvenient time table on
weekends is paramount to cutting the route completely. People gravitate towards convenience and especially right now
safety. Decreasing service will result in a lack of ridership for those who may have decided to take this route, and more
crowded busses for those of us who have no choice. Cutting service is like slowly poisoning yourself. How do you expect
your riders to continue using your services when you keep discontinuing rides and slashing away at your capability to be
a reliable form of transportation? I implore you to reconsider this decrease of service, this is not the right time.
Sincerely,
Stephanie Saccone

Hi Elizabeth,
Thank you for writing with these concerns. I have heard from other Heatherwood neighbors as well. I am
forwarding all of the emails that I receive to RTD's service planning staff and will discuss the concerns with the
proposed change with them.
We hate having to cut service. Right now, though, ridership is only about 40% of its pre‐Covid.numbers, which
is causing serious budget problems. The Heatherwood route has very few riders, especially during the
pandemic. The service team will verify ridership, and I will work with them to consider the options.
In addition, there are still three virtual public meetings where you can ask questions to staff and express your
concerns. The meetings are listed below. I encourage you and others to try to attend. Changes can still be

Hi Lynn,
I just learned that the 205 bus service to and from Heatherwood may be cancelled. We need our bus service! I've heard
from several neighbors who are disabled and it serves as their only form of transportation into Boulder. It is also
important to our middle and high school students as a way to be more independent. As housing prices in Boulder soar,
more college students are moving into the neighborhood to save money on rent and need transportation to CU. And for
the rest of us, we need greener options to get into Boulder. Heatherwood needs the 205!

FW: Your Recent Question

Writing to follow up on the response below. I understand schedule changes are made 3 times per year but this is a
significantly different year than previous ones. Covid changed everything in March. Ridership dropped, service was cut
back. Now we’re more aware of the covid challenges and more people have returned to work, driving. Traffic is getting
heavier and winter is approaching. I would feel confident riding the bus, masked up, and socially distant, and would
particularly appreciate riding during the winter. But the morning times for the eastbound FF5 are missing the mark with
no 8am bus. Arriving at 7am or 9am just doesn’t cut it.
I’ve kept my bus pass up all these months and now, when I need it most, I guess I will cancel b/c the scheduling can’t
meet my needs. My understanding from the message below is that nothing’s going to happen, if at all, until January,
correct?

Fwd: January 2021 Proposed Service Changes: Virtual Public Meetings

During normal times, I ride the GS four days per week, round trip from south Boulder to the Denver Federal Center
(where my office is located). With covid, of course, everything is different ‐‐ I have not ridden the GS bus since March,
and I have only been to my office a handful of times. I recognize the difficulty this puts on RTD, as I imagine that very
few people are riding the GS bus these days. So, I can see that a temporary suspension of this route makes sense, even
if it's unfortunate.
I hope very much that when things return to more of a normal pattern, the GS route will return. And, importantly, I
hope that this can happen pretty quickly. If people are commuting fairly normally, but there's no GS, then the regular
riders will develop other patterns and might not return to the GS. It seems like a pretty quick (weeks, months) return to
regular GS (even just a couple per day) will be important to keeping the ridership and keeping the healthy route.
Thanks,
Seth

January Service Changes

I appreciate your effort to improve morning rush hour service by adding more trips on the light rail E line (30 minute
frequency starting at 4:00 am). However, this does not improve the situation for Flatiron Flyer riders who connect with
light rail in the morning, as it seems the first trip out of Boulder on weekday mornings will continue to be at 5:00 am
(arriving at Union Station at 5:48).
I have been a faithful daily RTD commuter for 17 years from Westminster to the Denver Tech Center, starting with the
‘T’ bus route and then transitioning to FF1 and E line service when the ‘T’ line was cancelled. Unfortunately I need to be
to work at 6:30 am in the Denver Tech Center and was forced to stop riding when you cut service for COVID‐19. If you
don’t make an improvement to the FF1 service that is equitable to that proposed for the E line, I will be forced to
continue to drive. The same can be said of numerous coworkers who have recently discontinued riding RTD.
Please make an effort to restore service for all of your riders—we’re counting on leadership from RTD to do their best
for the entire district.

Please do not cancel Route GS

I am writing in response to the proposed elimination of the route GS bus this January. I have relied on this bus for the
past 5 years to get to work in Boulder from my home in Golden. This is largely a commuter bus that many people like
myself use to travel between Lakewood and Boulder. I understand that ridership is low due to so many of us now
working remotely during the pandemic, but just before the pandemic this route had increased ridership to the highest
numbers it has ever had. RTD had already cut this route down to a handful of busses each day. To completely eliminate
this bus would cause a huge hardship to myself and many others who rely on this bus. My fear is that it will take a long
time to reinstate this bus as we start returning to our offices, and that will leave many of us in a bind. I also fear that
they might not bring it back, as I know RTD is so short on funds.
The proposed vanpool option that RTD emailed us today is not clear. The vast majority of commuters on this route use
an ecopass. There is no information on what this vanpool would cost us out of pocket, and why we cannot use our
ecopasses, which are already paid for. I do not see this as a good option, and will cause many of us further hardship
since it will carry a higher cost.
Please do not cancel our GS bus! It is already running in a very limited capacity, please keep it that way so that we at
least have one or two options to get to Boulder each day.
Thank you,
Heather Michener

Conifer/Pine Junction Bus Route

This email is in response to the proposed upcoming route changes. Removing all bus lines to/from the
foothills is an unfair way to manage your business issues. You are cutting off an entire section of the metro
area, and yes, we are still in the metro area. Reducing the number is reasonable, but eliminating is not
appropriate.
Are you basing this assessment on recent ridership? Clearly during COVID the ridership decreased to virtually
nothing, but that won't last once the pandemic gets under control.
Will this be a temporary removal of these bus lines? It sounds like this decision is permanent. If it is
temporary until COVID is under control, that's understandable. But at least leave the option open to resume
these lines.
Are you concerned at all about the environment? You are putting that many more cars on the road, through
which your other buses will have to travel.
Parking downtown used to be horrible, without these lines it will be even worse. It may not seem that way
now, but once we get back to normal, we will all pay for this in many ways.
I was unable to attend any of your meeting due to my work schedule, but wanted to provide input. And I
would appreciate responses to my questions above.
You have a faithful following up here, and I can speak for myself and say I'd prefer to pay more than see the
bus lines go away entirely.
Please reconsider!!

CS/CV Proposed Changes - comments

As a former daily rider of the CV from Aspen park who has been working remotely since March, I completely understand
RTDs reasoning for discontinuing this route at this time. There is likely nowhere near the ridership needed to justify the
use of the motorcoaches that run this route until more progress is made around preventing the spread and severity of
COVID‐19.
I would strongly encourage RTD to reinstate this route once offices in downtown Denver are once again open without
restriction as to the number of workers in each office, as I, and many of my fellow state employees, really depend on the
CV route as our main means of transportation from our foothills community to the downtown area. We also see it as a
way to keep all of our cars off the road, which reduces both traffic and pollution, and it provides a safe way to get to
work during bad weather.
In summary: totally support and understand the elimination of the route in the short‐term, but strongly encourage
reinstating the route once people are able to return to work in large numbers.
Thank you for your consideration of my comments, and please let me know if you have any questions for me, or if I can
be of further assistance.

Respectfully,
Matt Mortier

Service Change
E Route

I've been riding the E route for over a decade. I HIGHLY suggest keeping this line open by running
one bus during these difficult times. If it stops running, I will close my office downtown because
parking rates are too expensive. You also get the domino effect. Denver loses demand for rent
leading to less people downtown leading to less economic activity = loose / loose situation. This route
is more than just a line on an income statement but a lifeline for businesses, families, individuals
which keep the mountain corridor connected.
Lastly, please keep this one route at a desirable time. The 5:30am buses are too early and it doesn't
solve the issue.
Sincerely,
John Briggs

Re: RTD Proposed R Line Service Change - 2021
Dear Mr. Ballard,
The City of Aurora, like other jurisdictions and agencies, is dealing with the significant negative impacts of
the COVID-19 pandemic—and in particular the resulting tax revenue shortfall and associated budget gaps
that are prevailing through 2020 and expected to continue through 2021. We certainly understand that the
Regional Transportation District (RTD) is facing some tough choices on how to address decreases in
ridership, fare revenue and a fall-off in sales and use tax revenues due to this pandemic.
Before the pandemic creeped into our everyday lives, the R Line experienced a 6.2% ridership increase in
2019—the highest among RTD's light rail lines. It is important to note that throughout this public health
crisis, the R Line has remained RTD's third best light rail line in retention of ridership. The R Line remains
the most direct connection to the A Line and Denver International Airport for the eastern metro area. This
rail line delivers essential workers in the healthcare and service industries to major job centers every day. It
serves 108,000 of the metro area's most vulnerable persons such as low income, elderly, young and those
living with disabilities.
Since the R Line started service in 2017. 5,500 new residences and 800,000 square feet of new commercial
space have been constructed. Development and redevelopment activities along the R Line continue at an
impressive pace with the full expectation of bringing new riders to transit-supportive activity centers like The
Point at Nine Mile, Parkside at City Centre and the Colfax and Fitzsimons stations serving the Anschutz
Medical Campus and Fitzsimons. Over 1,700 residential units and 170,000 square feet of commercial/retail
space are currently under construction and will open in 2020. These development quantities do not include
the development capacity at 13th Avenue, 2nd Avenue and Abilene Street, and Aurora Metro Center.
Additionally, the R Line is the only direct regional connection between the growing northeast metro area and
the booming southeast corridor, and there’s no doubt that it is a critical part of a thriving and equitable public
transit system for all as we work together to recover from COVID-19.

The City fully realizes adjusting the R Line to operate between Peoria Station and Lincoln Avenue Station
rather than from the current end-of-line RidgeGate Parkway Station on 30-minute frequencies is a reasonable
rail service operating action during the COVID-19 situation for 2021. Lincoln Avenue Station served as the
end-of-line station for the R Line as well as the E and F Lines serving the southeast corridor from their
opening days until the Southeast Rail Extension Project delivered the rail line extension that added Sky
Ridge, Lone Tree Town Center and RidgeGate Parkway Stations (now the end-of-line station) several years
ago.

Business development decisions continue to be made by public and private investors around R Line stations,
taking into account the overall regional transit connections and service offered. The addition of “Mixed-Use
Transit Oriented Development (MU-TOD)” zoning classification to Aurora’s Unified Development
Ordinance further encourages higher density land uses proximate to R Line stations together with strategic
incentives offered by the City towards private Transit Orientated Development around the R Line. Needless
to say, the City and the private sector are working collaboratively to optimize the ensuing station area
development as envisioned in our recently adopted Aurora Places comprehensive plan.
As the easternmost north-south transit corridor, the R Line is a unique and important line and a critical part
of a larger mobility system for a growing region. It is the only circumferential or non-radial line serving
destinations outside downtown Denver. This design serves the critical travel needs for thousands of
employees and residents between the region’s two major and growing employment centers and corridors, the
Fitzsimons/Anschutz Medical Campus currently with 30,000 employees and 100,000 daily visitors along the
I-225 corridor, and the Denver Tech Center, Inverness and Meridian business centers along the Southeast
corridor with 240,000 employees and daily visitors as well as offering the most direct connection to the A
Line and Denver International Airport for the eastern metro area. It serves as an important by-pass route to
alleviate the already congested central rail corridor at I-25/Broadway.
The R Line connects the region to major healthcare services, an essential and critical service for all, at the
Anschutz Medical Campus, the Medical Center of Aurora, Sky Ridge Medical Center and the Rocky
Mountain VA Regional Medical Center.
Maintaining the adjusted R Line service will send a positive message to the investment and development
community that will only serve to encourage future investments at rail in rail-orientated TOD.
Thank you for taking the time to consider the City’s position, concerns and comments as well as those of our
major stakeholders and the public. Our collective customers and stakeholders will continue to be well served
by the adjusted R Line service being proposed in 2021 delivering rail service between Peoria Station and
Lincoln Avenue Station. This is a reasonable transit service plan given the extremely challenging budget
environment brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Sincerely,

James M. Twombly
City Manager

It is important to note that for the pre-pandemic and current COVID-19 times, the overwhelming majority of
R Line customers in the southeast corridor (south of Dayton Station) board/alight R Line trains between
Belleview and Lincoln Avenue stations. No development currently exists at the Lone Tree Town Center and
RidgeGate Parkway Stations. Additionally, Lincoln Avenue Station hosts crossover tracks to accomplish
reversing the trains from southbound back to northbound direction.

Subject: Boulder Chamber Input Re: RTD Service Cuts
Lynn,
As we look at the service cuts, we wanted to get you our input ahead of this evening’s meeting.
Continued Support of Service Reductions being Temporary: We agree with the County’s perspective
that they’re not as bad as we had anticipated on some key lines, BUT we still strongly support the
message articulated in the NW MCC’s letter that was sent to RTD on Sept. 10 – specifically – that we
understand the need for the cuts and immediate actions needed to address the pandemic, but we
recommend:
o Fair allocation of service reduction across the region – that includes FasTracks and the
Base System together.
o Define criteria that provides for a clear understanding for restoring service as ridership
returns.
o Establish clear timelines for when these changes are in effect; thus defining that the
changes are only to address the pandemic-related conditions and then we have
assurance about how our service will return.
Identify routes or regions that can benefit from micro-mobility/micro-transit services: We are hearing
from our employers that some of our regional routes are still being utilized by their employees. If we see
ridership still occurring, but RTD is unable to provide full transit service, then consider how to fund or
provide micro-transit solutions through partners such as Via Mobility or DRCOG’s services.
Providing Service Through Partnerships: Much like the HOP model, allow for the local governments to
contract with local providers to provide service where needed and then be reimbursed by RTD for that
service. We feel that has been an effective mechanism for RTD to leverage partnerships to the benefit of
all parties. This way RTD can temporarily reduce service, while local providers can deliver it.
Feel free to call me or John if you have any questions or want to discuss further ahead of this evening’s
meeting.
Thank you for carrying this input forward in your representation of our region. We appreciate everything
you’re doing!

RTD Board of Directors
Paul Ballard, Interim General Manager and Chief Executive Officer
Regional Transportation District
1660 Blake Street
Denver, CO 80202
Dear RTD Board Chairperson Rivera-Malpiede and General Manager Ballard,
The City of Boulder appreciates our long-standing partnership with RTD in supporting and advancing
regional and local transit services. The city understands the unprecedented financial conditions due
to COVID-19 that are currently impacting RTD’s ability to maintain service levels and route options
across the region and in our community. During these difficult economic times, we seek continued
collaboration with RTD to ensure the provision of critical mobility options for essential workers and the
transit dependent.
The city has been actively following the development of the proposed RTD COVID-19 service plan for
January 2021. We appreciated the opportunity to meet with the RTD Service Planning Team on
October 13th and to further discuss our concerns and requested mitigation steps going forward.
Following is a summary of our specific concerns and requests as discussed with RTD staff on
October 13th:
1. Equally apply the 40% service reduction across the district: Transit service reductions
in Boulder, a major employment hub for our region and a strong transit market, greatly impact
journey to work options in the community, broader northwest area, and region. We are deeply
concerned by RTD’s reduction in service hours that disproportionally impact Boulder.
RTD has indicated the current COVID-19 and proposed January 2021 COVID-19 service plans
reflect a 40% reduction of service hours across the district. Our review of RTD route
schedules and service levels using the Remix transit planning software platform indicates the
proposed total service hour reduction is 47% for routes in Boulder. The 47% reduction brings
the loss of approximately 24,000 additional annual service hours than would occur with a 40%
reduction in Boulder. As the COVID-19 service plan generally provides Saturday service
levels on weekdays, there are many routes in Boulder that have been indefinitely suspended
due to not having a typical Saturday schedule. These suspended routes include: 206, 209, J,
Flatiron Flyer 2, Flatiron Flyer 4, Flatiron Flyer 6. and Airport/Boulder 2.

Boulder significantly contributes to RTD’s tax revenues for operations and has some of the
highest performing bus routes—making these proposed and continued reductions in Boulder
even more pronounced and impactful to those depending on RTD bus services to reach work
in or from Boulder. Service reductions should be fairly and equitably applied at the 40% level
geographically across the district—including in Boulder. We expect ridership demand in
Boulder to continue increasing as employees return to work and University of Colorado
Boulder (CU) students and faculty to return to campus Further, we are hopeful RTD will be
able to respond with timely service restorations.
We ask RTD staff to revisit proposed service levels in Boulder and collaborate with our staff to
restore service in response to increased service demand anticipated with return to work and
school trends. The intention is to provide service reductions at the 40% level in Boulder that
are consistent with the 40% service reduction proposed for the RTD district during the
operation of the COVID-19 service plan. The city’s priorities for service restorations include
the following:
1. Restoration of weekday Flatiron Flyer 4 trips serving the 28th Street/US-36 corridor,
University of Colorado Boulder, 29th Street Mall, and Boulder Junction areas with a
modified layover at downtown Boulder Station
2. Restoration of 206 weekday service
3. Restoration of 209 weekday service
4. Restoration of J weekday service
2. Restore Flatiron Flyer services to Boulder Junction, Twenty Ninth Street Mall, and
the University of Colorado Boulder (CU) campus areas: With the temporary closing of the
Boulder Junction Transit Center, the COVID-19 service plan has suspended critical regional
routes—including the Flatiron Flyer 4 & 6 and Airport/Boulder 2 routes—that directly serve CU,
the large Twenty Ninth Street Mall and surrounding retail areas with over 3,000 workers, and
the vibrant Boulder Junction transit oriented development (TOD). Consequently, there is no
service on the important 2.5-mile segment of the 28th Street/US-36 regional corridor between
the Table Mesa park-and-ride and Arapahoe Avenue.
The city is especially concerned with the indefinite suspension of route services at the Boulder
Junction Transit Center. Significant RTD and city partnership efforts and funding, along with
significant private sector investments, were recently committed to build the transit center and
continuous Transit Oriented Development actively occurring in the station area. Boulder
Junction has more than 300 affordable housing units and additional are planned and in
development. We understand there are operational savings by having Boulder Junction
Transit Center closed, yet we seek assurances that RTD transit services will operate again at
Boulder Junction in 2021 as people continue returning to work.

As requested above in 1.1. and until conditions improve to financially support the operational
costs associated with Boulder Junction’s reopening, the city requests the addition of modified
Flatiron Flyer 4 service to restore critical work and school trips for those needing to travel
between CU, the 29th Street Mall, Boulder Junction area, and communities connected via the
US-36 corridor with a modified layover location – such as downtown Boulder Station or the
RTD Boulder Terminal.
3. Expand Uber, Lyft, taxi voucher, and vanpool partnership programs to allow
continued mobility options in areas with suspended service. We appreciate RTD’s
efforts to find alternative mobility options through potential Uber, Lyft, taxi voucher, and
vanpool partnerships and flex/microtransit service options for riders impacted by suspended
services. For example, this strategy is proposed for the GS-Golden/Boulder route, which
provides critical bidirectional work trips between Boulder and Golden with service to
employment clusters at NIST/NOAA, NREL, and the Federal Center. There are other critical
employment areas in Boulder impacted with suspended and depleted services that would
benefit from such partnership programs.
Until fixed-route service is restored, we request RTD to preserve the ridership base and
expand these alternative mobility options in areas throughout the community with suspended
route services – including but not limited to the Flatirons Business Park/East Boulder,
Gunbarrel, and the Boulder Junction/29th Street Mall areas.
4. Continue to update communication related to suspended services, RTD alternative
transportation options, and criteria and timeline for service restoration. We understand
that the current and proposed COVID-19 service plan generally involves the provision of
Saturday services and schedules. We also appreciate continued communication efforts and
updates that convey the status of suspended routes – including the new RTD webpage that
details information about suspended routes online. From a customer standpoint, it would also
be helpful if information about suspended services and alternative options could be included
on RTD’s website specific to schedules, as this is a main interface for riders to search for and
determine their transit options. Currently, using the “Schedule Finder” feature does not return
any information indicating that a route is suspended or alternate transportation options.
Individual route pages that explain whether the route is suspended (example 209) or operating
with a reduced schedule (example 225) and other available mobility options would be very
beneficial to customers searching for route information on the schedules webpage.
We request RTD to provide more detailed information to riders where service has been
reduced, temporarily suspended, or eliminated. This should also include clear information
about alternatives available, especially if there are RTD alternatives like FlexRide. We
encourage RTD partnerships with transportation management organizations, such as Boulder
Transportation Connections and Commuting Solutions, to help with customer communication
and connecting riders impacted by service reductions with transportation alternatives.

5. Continued coordination with RTD staff in developing a phased plan to restore
suspended and reduced services in Boulder, with an eye to improvements. We
understand this temporary COVID-19 service plan is for an indefinite period and that RTD
intends to restore services when conditions allow. We encourage and will support RTD’s
upcoming efforts to develop criteria and a phased plan for route and service restoration—as
this will be a critical step in communicating available transit options, service level expectations,
and planned responses to current service gaps with the public.
As market conditions improve and ridership demand rebounds, we seek continued
opportunities to collaborate with RTD in planning and prioritizing the restoration of services and
identifyingpotential alternate options to best meet community mobility needs and expectations
for attractive and effective local and regional transit services.
Thank you for your consideration of our concerns and requests. Please direct follow-up
communication on these specific concerns and requests to Danny O’Connor, Transit Program
Manager (OConnorD@bouldercolorado.gov), who will be happy to further continue this discussion
and collaborate on next steps.
We look forward to continued partnership efforts in preserving, restoring, and improving transit
services in Boulder and across the region.

Dear RTD Board Chairperson Rivera-Malpiede and General Manager Ballard,
Commuting Solutions appreciates our long-standing partnership with RTD in
supporting and advancing regional and local transit services. We understand the
unprecedented financial conditions, due to COVID-19, that are impacting RTD’s
ability to maintain service levels and route options across the region. Our
organization strives for continued collaboration with RTD to ensure the provision
of critical mobility options for essential workers and the transit dependent during
these difficult economic times.
Commuting Solutions has been actively following the development of the
proposed RTD COVID-19 service plan for January 2021 and understands the
agency’s goal of applying a 40% reduction of service across the region.
However, based upon analysis completed by Boulder County, the cuts to the City
of Boulder services appear to be almost 10% higher than the District average.
Regional transit service cuts to Boulder, a critical employment hub for our region,
impacts the broader northwest area.
Our organization is deeply concerned by RTD’s reduction in service hours that
disproportionally affects Boulder, compared to the rest of the District. Please
reconsider the inequity of the current proposal and add transit service back to the
regional transit service serving the City of Boulder, particularly on the Flatiron
Flyer and the AB service to the airport.
Thank you for your consideration of our concerns and requests. We look forward
to our continuing and expanding partnerships to meet the mobility needs of the
northwest metro region.
Sincerely,

Craig Eicher

Dear RTD Board Chairperson Rivera-Malpiede and General Manager
Ballard,
The Northwest Mayors & Commissioners Coalition (MCC) appreciates
our long-standing partnership with RTD in supporting and advancing
regional and local transit services. The MCC understands the
unprecedented financial conditions due to COVID-19 that are
currently impacting RTD’s ability to maintain service levels and route
options across the region and in our communities, and we seek
continued collaboration with RTD to ensure the provision of critical
mobility options for essential workers and the transit dependent during
these difficult economic times.
Establish, in coordination with local jurisdictions, a documented
process for the restoration of suspended and reduced services
that uses January 2020 as a baseline of operations: The MCC has
been actively following the development of the proposed RTD COVID19 service plan for January 2021. We would like the Board of
Directors to make it clear through some documentation that when the
pandemic conditions ease that the service board from January of
2020 will be used as a starting place for operations rather than these
pandemic cuts and that these cuts will be temporary, and can be
revisited in September 2021. This would go a long way to engender
trust from our communities and to demonstrate that these cuts are
indeed temporary.
Expand RTD FlexRide, taxi or TNC voucher and vanpool
partnership programs to allow continued mobility options in
areas with reduced or suspended service: We would like to
acknowledge RTD's commitment to maintaining critical Access-a-Ride
service for existing and new qualifying candidates along suspended
routes. We would like to see RTD’s FlexRide service areas
promoted, expanded and become more flexible to better serve our
suburban areas that have seen full suspension of routes and

significant segments of routes, such as routes 53, 128, 205, 206, 209, and 228.
And, we appreciate RTD’s efforts to find alternative mobility options through
potential TNC, taxi voucher, and vanpool partnerships and flex/microtransit
service options for riders impacted by reduced and suspended services. For
example, this strategy is proposed for the GS-Golden/Boulder route, which
provides critical bi-directional work trips between Boulder and the Federal Center
in Golden, as well as for the Y route between Boulder and Lyons to provide
access for jobs, health care, groceries, and school trips. There are other critical
employment areas throughout the northwest region impacted with suspended
and depleted services that would benefit from such partnership programs. Until
fixed route service is restored, we request RTD to preserve the ridership base
and partner with local communities to expand these alternative mobility options in
areas throughout the District with suspended route services.
Continue to improve communication related to suspended services and
alternative transportation options available: We appreciate the recent
improvements to communicate information about suspended routes online. We
continue to request for RTD to improve communications about FlexRide service
options where they are available. It would be helpful for information about
suspended services and alternative options could be included on RTD’s website
specific to route schedules—as this is a main interface for customers to search
for and determine their transit options. Individual route pages that explain
whether the route is suspended (example 128) or operating with a reduced
schedule (example 228), RTD's intent with the route, and other available mobility
options would be beneficial to customers searching for route information on the
schedules webpage. We are asking RTD to provide more detailed information to
riders where service has been reduced, temporarily suspended, or eliminated.
This should also include clear information about alternatives available, especially
if there are RTD alternatives like FlexRide.
Thank you for your consideration of our concerns and requests. We understand
the magnitude of the financial impacts that RTD is facing and make these
requests in the spirit of supporting metro area-wide needs. We look forward to
continued and expanded partnerships to meet the mobility needs of the
northwest region and to communicate upcoming changes to our communities.
The MCC also supports additional letters that our local communities may be
sending to RTD regarding specific service changes.

Sincerely,

Members of the Northwest Mayors & Commissioners Coalition

measures for mission statement goals 1-7. In 2021, there are 44 proposed performance measures to
be tracked for the GM, which is two higher than in 2020.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Mission-Oriented Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Service
BACKGROUND
Each year the RTD Board of Directors adopts a vision and mission statement, goals, objectives, and
specific performance measures. These performance measures provide a framework in which RTD can
determine how well it provides service to its passengers and the citizens of the District within the
context of its mission statement, and they should integrate with the Board’s priorities for the coming
year.
A report detailing year-to-date performance on each of these measures is presented to the Board of
Directors following the end of each quarter. The proposed performance measures for 2021 are
brought to the Board of Directors for review at this time because the measures are used in
development of the 2021 Budget. These final 2021 performance measures are being presented to the
Board for adoption on October 27th.
DISCUSSION
Recommended changes in the performance measures from 2020 to 2021 are listed below:

3 A number of bus routes that had poor performance are being eliminated or modified with the restructuring of services when
the N Line opens. Also, the pandemic service plan has been problematic in Q2 in that the adoption of a Saturday schedule
for weekday service impacts on-time performance due to differences in service characteristics.
