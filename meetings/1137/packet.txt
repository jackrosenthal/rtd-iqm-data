Unanimous Consent
A.
Approval of Additional Risk Allocation Matrix Items to Fund North Metro to
72nd
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors direct staff to move forward with implementation of the following
additional Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM) items and to use the financing capacity
generated by these items to accelerate construction of the North Metro Rail Line
(NMRL) from Denver Union Station (DUS) to 72nd Avenue.
Specifically, it is recommended that staff move forward with the following
activities:


Refinancing three RTD debt issues at lower than current rates to reduce
payments, improve cash flow, and provide additional capacity under TABOR;



Issuing debt to bridge the Full Funding Grant Agreement (FFGA) for the Eagle
project at a lower interest rate than previously assumed, saving interest costs
and preserving additional capacity under Colorado’s Taxpayer Bill of Rights
(TABOR);



Issuing sales tax revenue bonds in 3rd Quarter, 2013 to finance remaining
portion of the DUS to 72nd Avenue segment;



Initiating procurement for construction (Request for Proposals) of the NMRL to
72nd Avenue in the next ten months.

Approval of the opportunities listed above will allow RTD to take advantage of the
low interest rates that financial markets are currently offering to accelerate the

completion of the NMRL to 72nd Avenue. This action will not impact the availability
of funding from previously-approved RAM items.

$183,420, Green Mountain Call-n-Ride will not exceed $293,172 and Golden Calln-Ride will not exceed $234,214. The total not to exceed amount will be
$710,806. These amounts include estimates for fuel costs that are treated as
“pass through” expenses.

XII.

Recommended Action
G.
Contract Award to HNTB Corporation for Northwest Area Mobility Study
(NAMS)
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board
of Directors authorize the General Manager to approve a thirteen-month
professional services contract award to HNTB Corporation to serve as the
consultant for the Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS) for an amount not to
exceed $2,022,091. It is further recommended that the RTD Board of Directors

GM
Board Meeting Date: February 14, 2013

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors direct staff
to move forward with implementation of the following additional Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM) items and
to use the financing capacity generated by these items to accelerate construction of the North Metro
Rail Line (NMRL) from Denver Union Station (DUS) to 72nd Avenue.
Specifically, it is recommended that staff move forward with the following activities:


Refinancing three RTD debt issues at lower than current rates to reduce payments, improve cash
flow, and provide additional capacity under TABOR;



Issuing debt to bridge the Full Funding Grant Agreement (FFGA) for the Eagle project at a lower
interest rate than previously assumed, saving interest costs and preserving additional capacity
under Colorado’s Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TABOR);



Issuing sales tax revenue bonds in 3rd Quarter, 2013 to finance remaining portion of the DUS to
72nd Avenue segment;



Initiating procurement for construction (Request for Proposals) of the NMRL to 72nd Avenue in the
next ten months.

Approval of the opportunities listed above will allow RTD to take advantage of the low interest rates that
financial markets are currently offering to accelerate the completion of the NMRL to 72nd Avenue. This
action will not impact the availability of funding from previously-approved RAM items.
BACKGROUND
RTD staff has developed a RAM that identifies specific cost saving/revenue enhancing opportunities
that, if enacted, would result in additional near-term funding for the FasTracks program. For each of
these opportunities, staff has identified the associated level of risk to the District and presented this risk
assessment to the RTD Board of Directors.
In December, 2012, the RTD Board of Directors approved the first eight recommended opportunities
identified as part of the RAM and confirmed the following goals for use of these funds:


Completion of US 36 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Project;



Construction of NMRL to at least 72nd Avenue;



Any remaining funds above the $300 million goal could leverage potential grants or private sector
contributions for FasTracks partially-funded projects (at the RTD Board’s discretion).

Packet Pg. 6

2.11.A

DISCUSSION
On January 22, 2013, staff presented the following additional RAM items for RTD Board information:


Refinancing three RTD debt issues at lower than current rates to reduce payments, improve cash
flow, and provide additional capacity under TABOR;



Issuing debt to bridge the FFGA for the Eagle project at a lower interest rate than previously
assumed, saving interest costs and preserving additional capacity under TABOR;



Issuing sales tax revenue bonds in 3rd Quarter, 2013 to finance remaining portion of the DUS to
72nd Avenue segment.

By approving this action, the RTD Board of Directors confirms their intent to move forward with these
RAM items. Each of these RAM items will be presented as a separate action to the RTD Board of
Directors at future meetings, as required by Bond Counsel.
Staff also recommends that the RTD Board use the financing capacity generated by these RAM items to
extend the NMRL from the National Western Stock Show (NWSS) to 72nd Avenue, which is estimated to
cost between $200 - $220 million (year of expenditure dollars). Approval of this action will allow RTD to
initiate procurement (Request for Proposals) for the NMRL to 72nd Avenue within the next 10 months.
RTD staff has assigned a risk level of “low” to these additional RAM items because they allow RTD to
take advantage of historically low interest rates to build more of the FasTracks program.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Approval of these additional RAM items will have a positive financial impact to the FasTracks capital
program by refinancing existing debt issues.
ALTERNATIVES
RTD staff identified the following alternatives for RTD Board consideration.
1.
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors direct
staff to move forward with implementation of the following additional Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM)
items and to use the financing capacity generated by these items to accelerate construction of the
NMRL to 72nd Avenue.
Specifically, it is recommended that staff move forward with the following activities:


Refinancing three RTD debt issues at lower than current rates to reduce payments, improve cash
flow, and provide additional capacity under TABOR;



Issuing debt to bridge the FFGA for the Eagle project at a lower interest rate than previously
assumed, saving interest costs and preserving additional capacity under TABOR;



Issuing sales tax revenue bonds in 3rd Quarter, 2013 to finance remaining portion of the DUS to
72nd Avenue segment;



Initiating procurement (Request for Proposals) for construction of the NMRL to 72nd Avenue in the
next ten months.

Packet Pg. 7

2.11.A

Approval of the opportunities listed above will allow RTD to take advantage of the low interest rates that
financial markets are currently offering to accelerate the completion of the NMRL to 72nd Avenue. This
action will not impact the availability of funding from previously-approved RAM items for other projects.

2.
Alternative #2. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of
Directors does not direct staff to move forward with implementation of these new RAM items. This
alternative is not recommended because it would not allow RTD to take advantage of historically low
interest rates that would result in additional funding for the FasTracks program.

Date:

Board Meeting Date: February 14, 2013

Subject:

Proposed 2013
Statement

and

2014

Fiscal

Policy

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
accept the modifications to the 2013 Fiscal Policy Statement as well as accept these modifications
for 2014.
BACKGROUND
Proposed modifications to the Fiscal Policy Statement are brought to the Board for approval during the
year, as necessary. In addition, each year staff presents the proposed Fiscal Policy Statement for the
following fiscal year for approval to the Board of Directors as an initial step in development of the
Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) and Recommended Budget.
The most recent modification to the Fiscal Policy Statement was approved by the Board of Directors in
October 2012 for the 2013 fiscal year. The approved policy modifications for 2013 were primarily to
define the FasTracks Fund Balance Policy to maintain three months of operating expenses excluding
depreciation for FasTracks operations. This modification was approved to be consistent with the Base
System Fund Balance Policy which follows GFOA recommended best practices to provide stability of
service levels during economic downturns or other unforeseen financial events. The 2013 Fiscal Policy
Statement modifications specifically addressed the operating fund balance needs of the FasTracks
program because the opening of the first FasTracks corridor for revenue service will occur in 2013.
DISCUSSION
Board approval is requested in order to update the RTD Fiscal Policy Statement for 2013 to include the
FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) and to use this updated Fiscal Policy Statement in the
development of the 2014 Strategic Budget Plan and 2014 Requested Budget.
Recommended changes to the Fiscal Policy Statement are shown in the accompanying marked-up
document with changes indicated in red.
The proposed changes to the Fund Balance Policies section are requested in order to align fiscal policies
with the establishment of the FISA beginning in 2013 as approved by the Board of Directors in
December 2012. This Fund Balance Policy modification will add a separate fund, referred to as FISA, to
track funds that become available from the sources identified in the Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM). The
FISA was established to identify and appropriate funding for FasTracks projects that are currently
unfunded. Expenditures from the FISA fund must be approved by the Board of Directors.
The proposed changes to the Debt Policies section are requested to reflect the most recent bond rating
agency credit ratings that were completed with the December 2012 bond issuance.

Packet Pg. 9

2.11.B

The proposed change to the Budget Policies which removes the reference to excluding depreciation from
the budget, reflects the revised methodology to roll forward budgeted fund balances for consistent
comparison to actual results.
All other policies remain unchanged from the previous Board approved 2013 policies.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Changing the policy as requested will not have a financial impact on the 2013 Budget. Items identified
in the RAM that will provide funding for the FISA will primarily begin in 2014. As opportunities arise in
2013 to contribute funds to the FISA, the proposed 2013 Amended Budget will be adjusted accordingly.

ALTERNATIVES
1. Approve the recommended changes to RTD’s Fiscal Policy Statement. Staff supports this
alternative because the changes address the Fund Policy needs of the FISA and RAM as well as
provides current information regarding credit ratings and budgeting methods.
2. Board further modifies the recommended changes. Staff has reviewed the RTD Fiscal Policy
Statement and welcomes any suggestions for modifications requested by the Board.
3. Do not adopt the recommended changes to RTD’s Fiscal Policy Statement. This is not
recommended because the District’s Fiscal Policy Statement would not contain all current
language and would not best facilitate the needs of the District’s financial operations and tracking
of the FISA.

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT
2013-20143 PROPOSED FISCAL POLICY STATEMENT

REVENUE POLICIES
1. The Board of Directors will review potential fare increases annually at the time of the
development of the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP). As part of this process, staff will
review potential fare increases to establish a fare structure with due consideration for:
 consistency and equity throughout RTD;
 ease of use and simplicity;
 maintaining or increasing ridership and fare revenues;
 acceptability and marketability of fare structure to customers and the general public;
and
 verification and enforceability of fare payment compliance.
2. Fare policies should take into account the special needs of transit dependent, elderly,
youth, student, handicapped, and commuter patrons.
3. RTD will avoid dependence on temporary revenues to fund ongoing services. One-time
revenues will be used for one-time expenditures.
4. RTD will continuously explore additional sources of revenue to help balance the budget.
5. When appropriate the Board will actively pursue legislation that would help ensure the
continued accomplishment of RTD’s goals and mission statement. The Board will
support efforts to ensure that legislative intent is realized in allocation of state financial
resources to public transit. The Board will actively oppose legislation that would limit or
diminish revenue.
6. Staff will identify on an annual basis excess property and equipment, and will make an
ongoing attempt to sell such excess property and equipment to enhance cash flow.

INVESTMENT POLICIES
1. RTD will review its investment policy annually with the Board to ensure consistency with
the following objectives (in order of priority):
 safety of invested funds;
 maintenance of sufficient liquidity to meet cash flow needs; and
1

Packet Pg. 11

attainment of the maximum yield possible consistent with the first two objectives

Attachment: FINAL 2014 Fiscal Policy Statement (1497 : Proposed 2013 and 2014 Fiscal Policy Statement)



2. RTD will review its investment performance on a quarterly basis with the Board.

EXPENDITURE POLICIES
1. RTD will endeavor to achieve service levels that will make the transit system easier to
use, improve travel times, and be more effective.
2. RTD will continue to look for and implement the most cost-effective and reliable
methods of delivering transportation services.
3. RTD will maintain all assets at a level that protects capital investment and minimizes
future maintenance and replacement costs.
4. RTD maintains a risk management program which will provide protection against loss
and mitigate exposure to liability.
5. A safety program will be maintained to minimize RTD's exposure to liability and thereby
reduce the number of claims against RTD.
6. RTD will develop service changes that are needed to respond to budget shortfalls using
the system-wide and route-specific productivity measures that have been approved by
the Board.

CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT POLICIES
1. RTD will prepare and update annually a six-year Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) including
projected capital construction and improvements, service levels and operating costs,
and revenues to fund the capital and operating programs. Capital projects to be
included in the SBP will be evaluated using the following criteria:
 total project cost (design and construction) and schedule for completion;
 source of funding;
 operating and maintenance costs for the remainder of the SBP period;
 benefits and contributions to RTD and the community, including but not limited to the
effect on future operating and maintenance costs, economy, service, and ridership;
 consideration of alternatives (joint development, etc.); and
 consequences of not funding
2. Priority will be given to replacement of existing assets before consideration of new
assets except as allowed for in the FasTracks financial plan (see 7.).

Fiscal Policy Statement - effective February 19, 2013

Attachment: FINAL 2014 Fiscal Policy Statement (1497 : Proposed 2013 and 2014 Fiscal Policy Statement)

3. RTD will use the first year capital program from the adopted SBP as the basis for the
capital program to be included in the annual budget.
4. After completion of design of a capital project, cost estimates will be revised. If the cost
estimates exceed Delegation of Authority limits, the project will be brought to the Board
for reconsideration.
5. Facilities will be designed using current technology and allow for future technological
changes in order to be efficient and cost-effective and to protect the public welfare.
6. RTD shall allow for multi-year capital projects to be carried forward in accordance with
the carry-forward resolution adopted by the Board.
7. RTD will prepare an annual update of the FasTracks financial plan incorporating the
actual costs incurred and the most recent available projections of capital improvement
costs, service levels, and operating costs and revenues to fund the FasTracks capital
and operating programs.

FUND BALANCE POLICIES
1. RTD will strive to maintain a fund balance in the Base System and in the FasTracks
operating budget, to provide for unanticipated expenditures of a nonrecurring nature or
to meet unexpected increases in costs. This unrestricted fund balance will be
comprised of a Board appropriated fund, a capital replacement fund and an
undesignated working capital fund as described below. For the Base System, the total
of these three funds should be maintained at an amount approximately equal to three
months of Base System operating expenses excluding depreciation. For FasTracks,
the total of these three funds should be maintained at an amount approximately equal to
twothree months of FasTracks operating expenses excluding depreciation. RTD will
consider and pursue resources that will be directed to fund balance replenishment. For
example, RTD may define the revenue sources that would typically be looked to for
replenishment of fund balance to include non-recurring revenues and budget surpluses.
Year-end surpluses are an especially appropriate source for replenishing fund balance.
RTD will replenish fund balances as soon as economic conditions allow.

2. In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will designate a Board appropriated fund
balance on an annual basis. Use of the fund balance will be minimized and occur only
in specific circumstances such as severe economic downturns. With Board approval,
these funds may be used to avoid cash flow interruptions, reduce the need for shortterm borrowing, and assist in maintaining an investment-grade bond rating. The source
of replenishment of this fund will be identified and will take place in a prompt manner.
3

Packet Pg. 13

2.11.B.a

3. In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will designate a capital replacement fund
on an annual basis. With Board approval, these funds will be used for scheduled major
vehicle replacements and other capital purchases. The source of replenishment of this
fund will be identified and will take place in a prompt manner.
4. RTD will designate excess and undesignated working capital that may accrue at each
year-end to be placed in an unrestricted fund to be used to respond to unanticipated
events.

5. RTD will maintain an emergency (TABOR) reserve equal to three percent of nonFederal revenues, as specified by Article X, Section 20 of the Colorado Constitution.
6. RTD will maintain all revenues in excess of expenditures for Denver Union Station in a
reserve for future development of Denver Union Station as a rapid transit hub, as
specified in the intergovernmental agreement as amended on April 20, 2004.
7. The Board shall establish threetwo reserves for future construction under the FasTracks
plan:
 The FasTracks Contingency Reserve will be appropriated at a level of $30 million
each year. These funds will be available to fund adjustments to the FasTracks
construction schedule, relating to logistics or cost savings opportunities that might
arise after the annual budget is adopted, and will not be used to fund the (nonFasTracks) base system capital or operating activity.
 The FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) will be used to provide funding for
future FasTracks projects that are currently unfunded. Expenditures from the FISA
will be subject to Board approval with the staff recommended project goals identified
in the Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM). Funding of the FISA will be provided from the
sources identified in the Board approved RAM and other sources approved by the
Board.
 All other FasTracks funds which have not been appropriated, or otherwise
designated as reserved, in the current budget year will be maintained in a reserve
for future FasTracks capital and operating expenditures and will not be used to fund
the (non-FasTracks) Bbase Ssystem expenditures.

DEBT POLICIES
1. Capital projects funded through the issuance of bonds or Certificates of Participation
(COPs) shall be financed for a period not to exceed the expected useful life of the asset.

3. Before bonded long-term debt is issued, the impact of debt service on total annual
expenditures will be analyzed.
4. Bond financing or COPs will not be issued to support current operating expenditures.
It is the intent of RTD to maintain a high quality investment-grade credit rating. The
benefit of maintaining RTD's bond ratings at the highest reasonably attainable level in
light of current economic conditions and availability of capital funding is to receive lower
interest rates and lower bond or certificate insurance premiums than would be possible
with lower credit ratings. RTD’s current ratings are listed below:

5. RTD will maintain a minimum gross sales tax revenue bond coverage ratio for the
Bbase Ssystem (annual non-FasTracks sales and use tax revenue to annual sales and
use tax debt service for senior non-FasTracks debt) of four times for debt backed by the
0.6% sales and use tax. RTD will maintain a minimum gross sales tax revenue bond
coverage ratio for FasTracks (annual FasTracks sales and use tax revenue to annual
FasTracks sales and use tax debt service) of two times for debt backed by the 0.4%
FasTracks sales and use tax.
6. RTD will maintain a minimum net revenue coverage ratio (all annual revenues
remaining after operating and maintenance expenses, net of passthrough grants, to
annual debt service requirements net of excess appropriations required for variable rate
debt) of 1.2 times total debt.

BUDGET POLICIES
1. RTD shall comply with all requirements of the Colorado Local Government Budget Law.

such as postponing preventive maintenance expenditures or replacement of equipment,
will be avoided.
13. RTD will provide conservative revenue estimates that take into consideration recent
experience and reflect reasonable future growth.
14. RTD will monitor revenue sources regularly and amend the budget, as necessary, to

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: February 7, 2013

From:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

February 6, 2013

Board Meeting Date: February 14, 2013

Subject:

April 2013 Service Changes

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors approve
the April 2013 Service Change package as revised and summarized in Attachment A resulting in an
annualized cost increase of approximately $53,200 and, further, to authorize the General Manager or his
designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is impacted
by these changes.
DISCUSSION
With the completion of construction of the West Light Rail Line and Board adoption of the West Corridor
Service Plan, significant changes in bus and light service are slated to begin April 28, 2013. Attachment
C of this report is a copy of the Board Report containing the West Corridor Service Plan as adopted by
the Board of Directors on October 23, 2012.
Additional routine service changes not associated with or included in the West Corridor Service Plan are
necessary to maintain system on-time performance and provide the appropriate level of service
according to customer demand. For this year we will continue to focus on adjusting services in response
to the January 2012 service revisions and changes in ridership and operational performance.
The proposed April 2013 Service Changes contained herein reflect the continued budgetary challenges
faced by RTD. The guiding principles for service changes continue to be:
•
Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards
•
The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets
•
The availability of alternative services to affected riders
•
Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services
•
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin
•
Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
SUMMARY OF PUBLIC HEARINGS
Given the limited nature of the proposed service changes, the E-Alert system was employed to alert
customers of schedule changes to affected services. A summary of customer comments from the
Service Change website is contained in Attachment B of this report.
CHANGES TO INITIAL RECOMMENDATIONS
Staff receives input during the public comment process and continues to conduct additional analysis
after the initial service recommendations are proposed to the Board of Directors. Depending on the
outcome of the public comment process and continued analysis, staff may or may not propose
modifications to these initial recommendations. The following represent changes proposed to the service
changes initially proposed to the Board of Directors for implementation as part of January 2013 service
changes:

West Corridor Service Plan – April 2013

DISCUSSION

INFO

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that the Board of
Directors approve the West Corridor Service Plan package as revised and summarized in
Attachment A and, further, to authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute
contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is impacted by
these changes.
BACKGROUND
Pursuant to the Board policy on service changes, service plans for the implementation of
the West Light Rail Line and connecting transit network are included herein. The primary
objectives of this plan are to:
 provide the appropriate level of service to the West Line Light Rail stations
 provide reliable and convenient transit service from within the residential,
commercial and governmental areas surrounding the West Line
 establish convenient connections between Call-n-Ride, bus and rail service to
accommodate passenger travel patterns throughout the day.
 Establish new W-Line light rail service within the corridor.
DISCUSSION
The West Line light rail service is slated to begin April 28, 2013. While diverse
suggestions for service changes routinely are offered and considered, a formal public input
process for the West Corridor began with the Environmental Impact Study in 2002-2003.
This included discussions with the public that determined which stations would be
equipped with bus gates, how many would be provided, etc. It also introduced the
concept of replacing “line haul” bus service with light rail service and using buses for local
access.
The Preliminary West Corridor Service Plan was updated and taken to local governments
and stakeholders in mid/late 2011 and was also available for anyone to review on RTD’s
Website. E-mail contacts were also made with local governments, including supplying
them with links to the preliminary draft plan. Revisions were made with the information
gleaned from these sources and the Draft Plan was brought to the RTD Board in February

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

2.11.C.b

Attachment A details the West Line service plan and Attachment B contains the public
meeting summaries.
CHANGES TO INITIAL RECOMMENDATIONS
Eight public meetings were held between April 16th-28th in order to obtain comments on
the proposed service plan for the West Corridor, including the West Rail Line (W-Line) and
bus and call-n-Ride services. 201 public participants offered their views or attended to ask
questions. Information from the hearings and additional field work was then taken into
account where resources permit and the plan was modified.
Based on input received during the public comment process and additional analysis
conducted, the non-highlighted changes were recommended to the Board of Directors in
July 2012. The Board requested additional changes to the plan and a summary these are
highlighted in yellow below. The details of these changes are presented in Attachment A:
Route 9 – West 10th Avenue: is proposed to operate as the existing Route 9 between
Sakura Square and the Lakewood-Wadsworth Station
Route 20 – 20th Avenue: routing west of Wadsworth would be retained
Route 21 – Evans Crosstown: routing change in the Federal Center
Route 26 – West 26th Avenue : new fixed route service connecting Applewood Village to
Wadsworth Station
Route 28 – 28th Avenue: rerouted to serve Lakewood/Wadsworth Station
Route 30Ltd – South Federal Limited: routing change west of Wadsworth
Route 32 – West 32nd Avenue/City Park: is proposed to continue on its current route and
schedule
Route 36Ltd – Fort Logan Limited: schedule changes to coordinate with Route 30Ltd
Route 49 – North Lowell: proposed new route was deleted from the proposal
Route 50 – Lakes Crosstown: replaces the Route 49 proposal providing a connection to
the West Line at Sheridan Station

2012 for review and permission to proceed to public meetings for the West Corridor
service. The public meetings were held in April 2012 and further revisions were made to
the draft plan. Staff also met in this period with City of Wheat Ridge staff members to
determine adjustments in that city’s service, met with City and County of Denver staff
members and related agencies in the Denver Livability Partnership, corresponded in detail
with an interested Edgewater council member, met with Jefferson County Local
Coordinating Committee and JeffTAAG (Jefferson County Transportation Action and
Advocacy Group). Throughout this period, suggestions and questions from the general
public continued to be received. Briefings with the RTD Board also continued during this
period (May 2012 and June 2012) and adjustments to the Draft plan continued to be
made during this period.

2.11.C.b

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The annual change in cost of for the base system budget due to the West Line Service
Plan was intended to be revenue neutral. The changes listed herein represent a 1.27%
increase in annual service hours over current West Corridor service or an estimated
$371,000 annual. The Golden Call-n-Ride will be funded under a CMAQ grant from 2013
to 2016, thereby reducing the operational cost impact by $ 263,000 during the grant
funded period, the resultant net cost impact to the base system will be $108,000
annually. The annual cost for the West Line Light Rail service will be sourced from the
FasTracks budget.

West Corridor Service Plan – April 2013

ACTION X

DISCUSSION

INFO

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that the Board of
Directors approve the West Corridor Service Plan package as revised and summarized in
Attachment A and, further, to authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute
contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is impacted by
these changes.
BACKGROUND
Pursuant to the Board policy on service changes, service plans for the implementation of
the West Light Rail Line and connecting transit network are included herein. The primary
objectives of this plan are to:
 provide the appropriate level of service to the West Line Light Rail stations
 provide reliable and convenient transit service from within the residential,
commercial and governmental areas surrounding the West Line
 establish convenient connections between Call-n-Ride, bus and rail service to
accommodate passenger travel patterns throughout the day.
 Establish new W-Line light rail service within the corridor.
DISCUSSION
The West Line light rail service is slated to begin April 28, 2013. While diverse
suggestions for service changes routinely are offered and considered, a formal public input
process for the West Corridor began with the Environmental Impact Study in 2002-2003.
This included discussions with the public that determined which stations would be
equipped with bus gates, how many would be provided, etc. It also introduced the
concept of replacing “line haul” bus service with light rail service and using buses for local
access.
The Preliminary West Corridor Service Plan was updated and taken to local governments
and stakeholders in mid/late 2011 and was also available for anyone to review on RTD’s
Website. E-mail contacts were also made with local governments, including supplying
them with links to the preliminary draft plan. Revisions were made with the information
gleaned from these sources and the Draft Plan was brought to the RTD Board in February

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

2.11.C.c

Attachment A details the West Line service plan and Attachment B contains the public
meeting summaries.
CHANGES TO INITIAL RECOMMENDATIONS
Eight public meetings were held between April 16th-28th in order to obtain comments on
the proposed service plan for the West Corridor, including the West Rail Line (W-Line) and
bus and call-n-Ride services. 201 public participants offered their views or attended to ask
questions. Information from the hearings and additional field work was then taken into
account where resources permit and the plan was modified.
Based on input received during the public comment process and additional analysis
conducted, the non-highlighted changes were recommended to the Board of Directors in
July 2012. The Board requested additional changes to the plan and a summary these are
highlighted in yellow below. The details of these changes are presented in Attachment A:
Route 9 – West 10th Avenue: is proposed to operate as the existing Route 9 between
Sakura Square and the Lakewood-Wadsworth Station
Route 20 – 20th Avenue: routing west of Wadsworth would be retained
Route 21 – Evans Crosstown: routing change in the Federal Center
Route 26 – West 26th Avenue : new fixed route service connecting Applewood Village to
Wadsworth Station
Route 28 – 28th Avenue: rerouted to serve Lakewood/Wadsworth Station
Route 30Ltd – South Federal Limited: routing change west of Wadsworth
Route 32 – West 32nd Avenue/City Park: is proposed to continue on its current route and
schedule
Route 36Ltd – Fort Logan Limited: schedule changes to coordinate with Route 30Ltd

2012 for review and permission to proceed to public meetings for the West Corridor
service. The public meetings were held in April 2012 and further revisions were made to
the draft plan. Staff also met in this period with City of Wheat Ridge staff members to
determine adjustments in that city’s service, met with City and County of Denver staff
members and related agencies in the Denver Livability Partnership, corresponded in detail
with an interested Edgewater council member, met with Jefferson County Local
Coordinating Committee and JeffTAAG (Jefferson County Transportation Action and
Advocacy Group). Throughout this period, suggestions and questions from the general
public continued to be received. Briefings with the RTD Board also continued during this
period (May 2012 and June 2012) and adjustments to the Draft plan continued to be
made during this period.

2.11.C.c

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The annual change in cost of for the base system budget due to the West Line Service
Plan was intended to be revenue neutral. The changes listed herein represent a 1.27%
increase in annual service hours over current West Corridor service or an estimated
$371,000 annual. The Golden Call-n-Ride will be funded under a CMAQ grant from 2013
to 2016, thereby reducing the operational cost impact by $ 263,000 during the grant
funded period, the resultant net cost impact to the base system will be $108,000
annually. The annual cost for the West Line Light Rail service will be sourced from the
FasTracks budget.

serving most areas within Golden west of a line drawn along Johnson Road, West 10th
Avenue, and Ulysses Street. Services would operate on weekdays between 5:30 a.m. and
8:00 p.m., with additional hours or days in special situations indicated below. Through
additional Federal and local funding obtained by the City of Golden, it is proposed to
operate this call-n-Ride six days a week, with extended hours on Saturday nights.
Scheduled times would be posted for Jefferson County Social Services facilities.
Green Mountain call-n-Ride is proposed to be based at Federal Center Station, serving
areas roughly defined by Union Boulevard, Cedar Drive, Green Mountain Park, Alameda
Parkway, Indiana Street, Morrison Road, and Kipling Parkway. It would enter the Denver
Federal Center for passengers ending or beginning their trips in that facility. Services
would operate on weekdays between 5:30 a.m. and 8:00 p.m., with additional hours or
days in special situations indicated below.

SUMMARY OF PUBLIC HEARINGS

Individuals expressed support for retaining a one-seat ride on Local Route 9 from the area
of the Garrison Station to the Market Street Station vicinity, criticized the alignment of the
Light Rail line at Union Station, suppoRouted the alignment of the Light Rail line at Union
Station and asked neutral questions about changes proposed for Route AF. Six RTD staff
members attended the meeting and answered numerous questions afterward.
Clements Community Center - Lakewood
Wednesday, April 18, 2012
The 52 members of the public who attended the Lakewood meeting represented diverse
interests. Common concerns were the proposed loss of direct bus service into Downtown
on Routes 20, 28, 32 in the area to be covered by the Applewood call-n-Ride and
expected inadequacies in the call-n-Ride services for that area and replacing Route 17 for
the Jefferson County Human Services complex. Division Director Lynnae Flora of the
Jefferson County Department of Human Services stated that the call-n-Ride will be
inadequate to access their campus. Two customers also spoke in favor of retaining Route
100X as a one-seat ride to Civic Center Station.
Individuals covered a number of issues: Discontinuance of Route 9 between Wadsworth
and Federal was opposed due to the poor sidewalks leading to light rail stations, with a
circulator route for those neighborhoods proposed as an alternative; objections to the slow
speed of the 16th Street Mall Ride; concern about possible travel times on the proposed
Route AF. Non-service issues raised included a suggestion that an intense safety program
be adopted along the line. One speaker objected to call-n-Ride vans operating in the
vicinity of Garrison Station as a betrayal of RTD’s commitment not to operate bus service
on Garrison Street. RTD Director Matt Cohen heard the testimony, along with six RTD
staff members.
Written testimony prepared for this meeting and submitted in lieu of making statements
included support for the idea of extending Route 76Ltd from West Colfax to Olde Town
Arvada; a proposal to replace Route 17 in the Jeffco Government Center with a fixed
route, rather than a call-n-Ride; adding a deviation to Route 49 to serve Regis University’s
campus.

Monday, April 16, 2012
The goal of retaining a one-seat ride on Routes 100X and 116X drew the most interest
from the 26 members of the public attending the Golden meeting. Participants felt that
the proposed alternatives were too slow and worried that adding a Regional Route KC
from the Ken Caryl area would divide ridership up, rather than attracting customers. Two
speakers, including Tim Young (Jefferson County Human Services Manager for Child
Services), expressed concern about the proposed Golden call-n-Ride’s ability to handle the
family traffic on the mile stretch between their buildings and the light rail terminal.
(Service is presently provided by Route 17.)

Individual concerns were voiced, including the needs of Wheat Ridge High School students
on Route 32 in the segment proposed to be replaced by a call-n-Ride; concern was also
expressed by a satisfied user of the Dry Creek call-n-Ride who did not feel that call-n-Ride
service areas as large as proposed in the West Corridor plan were workable. Five staff
participated in the meeting.
Hadley Branch – Denver Public Library
Saturday, April 21, 2012
Diverse comments were offered by the eight members of the public who attended the
meeting. One person was critical of the Union Station alignment, versus going into the
central Downtown loop. Another had questions about where the new line would go in
Downtown. Others opposed removing Route 14 west of Wadsworth, but asked that it be
scheduled for favorable connections with Route 76; supported restoring Route 100 service
on Sundays; opposed discontinuing Route 17 service on West 44th Avenue at the Colorado
Railroad Museum; expressed concern about replacing Route 17 at the Human Services
building with the Golden call-n-Ride; supported 7-day a week operation of the Golden calln-Ride. Three RTD staff members and one City and County of Denver planner heard the
testimony and answered questions.
Blair-Caldwell Library – Five Points
Saturday, April 21, 2012
The most commonly expressed concern among the 14 members of the public at this
meeting regarded the call-n-Ride service proposed to replace Route 17 for Jeffco Human
Services buildings and in Applewood replacing segments of Routes 20, 28, and 32. In
brief, the concern regarding the former is that the special needs of Human Services clients
could not be met and for the latter that capacity would be insufficient. A written proposal
was presented describing a merger of segments of Routes 20 and 28 to continue serving
NREL. Two speakers also objected to the lack of rail service between Five Points and the
West Line/Union Station and favored a shuttle route of some type.
Individual statements were made in support of retaining Route 9 east to Sheridan
Boulevard instead of introducing the new Route 49; in support of the Route 16 service
change proposal if the first weekday morning trip remains in the current time frame; in
favor of signaling changes on Welton Street to cure schedule adherence problems; in favor
of moving the proposed B-C fare zone boundary west one station in order to lower fares at
Oak Station; opposed removing Route 3 from Green Mountain; opposed the proposed

Retaining through service to Civic Center Station on Routes 100X and 116X was the top
concern among the 32 members of the public who attended the Bear Valley meeting.
Similar concerns were raised on behalf of Route 2X service in the Green Mountain area.
The route alternatives in the service proposal were opposed, but suggestions were made
by customers for other alternatives. The majority favored – if the Express routes were not
retained as they are – adding a stop on the proposed Regional Route KC at the unofficial
park-n-Ride at C-470/Quincy. The proposed discontinuance of Route 21 in the area to be
served by the Green Mountain call-n-Ride was also a concern of many, especially in regard
to service for Green Mountain High School.

Wednesday, April 25, 2012
The most urgently expressed interest in the noon meeting in Downtown Denver was in
support of retaining a one-seat ride on Routes 100X and 116X between western
Lakewood and Ken Caryl points and Civic Center Station. Six of the 26 members of the
public attending named this as their concern. Alternatives were offered by some,
including adding a stop at Federal Center Station or adding an unofficial Park-n-Ride at the
C-470/Quincy interchange to the proposed Route KC. Individuals raised issues regarding
the loss of Route 2X service to Morrison that can be used for hiking into concerts at Red
Rocks Amphitheater, Route 21 travel needs of Green Mountain High School students, a
potential shortage of space on Route 16 if customers do not switch to Light Rail,
replacement of Route 17 service with call-n-Ride, the double transfer required to get
between the new W-Line and the Southeast F/H-Lines0, and a lack of capacity for
wheelchair customers running into other customers on the ramp at Littleton/Downtown
Station. Ten RTD staff members attended the meeting.
Conifer Library, Conifer
Wednesday, April 25, 2012
Support for the proposed West Corridor service plan as related to Routes CV/CS/CX
serving the Conifer area was the theme of much of the Conifer meeting. One speaker
spoke in support of retaining Route 6X. Other issues were raised by individuals, including
requests for improvements in specific connections, interest in information about the plans
for Pine Junction Park-n-Ride, and requests to go back to using glass in shelters. Twenty
members of the public, plus RTD Board Director Bruce Daly, were in attendance. Four
RTD staff members participated in the meeting.
Evergreen Library, Evergreen
Saturday, April 28, 2012
The major interest of the 23 attendees was in supporting the proposed retention of
through Regional Routes EV/ES/EX service into Civic Center Station. Two attendees
spoke in support of retaining Route AF service at the Federal Center Station. Individual
comments included: anxiety about security for passengers with luggage at Union Station;
a request to add a round trip to Denver from Evergreen on Saturdays and Sundays; a
request to run the Evergreen call-n-Ride till 9:00 p.m.; a request to extend skyRide to
Evergreen; noted a need for information on how to get to the Performing Arts complex
from the West Line.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: February 7, 2013

From:

Terry Howerter, Chief Financial Officer

GM

Date:

February 7, 2013

Board Meeting Date: February 14, 2013

Subject:

Resolution No.__, Series of 2013 related to the
issuance of RTD Taxable Sales Tax Revenue
Refunding Bonds, Series 2013A

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Resolution”), authorizing the issuance of Regional
Transportation District Taxable Sales Tax Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series 2013A.
BACKGROUND:
On January 22, 2013, staff presented the refinancing of three RTD debt issues at lower than current
interest rates to reduce payments, improve cash flow, and provide additional capacity under TABOR as a
Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM) item and proposed to use the financing capacity generated by the
refundings as a step toward accelerating construction of the North Metro Rail Line from Denver Union
Station to 72nd Avenue.
This action item discusses the first of the three bond refunding opportunities that were included in the
RAM item proposed on January 22, 2013.
DISCUSSION:
RTD issued its $116 million Sales Tax Revenue Bonds, Series 2004A (the “2004 Bonds”) in 2004 for
the purpose of financing a portion of the southeast light rail corridor. At present, $5.750 million par
amount of the 2004 Bonds remain outstanding.
RTD issued its $100 million Sales Tax Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series 2005A (the “2005 Bonds”) in
2005 for the purpose of refunding the 2000A and 2002B bonds then outstanding. At present, $98.865
million par amount of the 2005 Bonds remain outstanding.
With long-term interest rates near historic lows, RTD has the potential to advance refund the remaining
outstanding 2004 and 2005 Bonds on a callable basis to realize, subject to market movement, a savings
of approximately $24.2 million (3.06% of principal of refunded bonds). The Bond Resolution requires a
minimum savings of 2% which allows some flexibility in regards to changes in interest rates between
now and the date the bonds are sold.
The 2004 Bonds are callable November 1, 2013 at par and the 2005 Bonds are callable November 1,
2015 at par.Pursuant to U.S. Treasury regulations, an issue of tax-exempt bonds may (a) be advance
refunded (refunding bonds sold more than 90 days in advance of the redemption date of the outstanding
bonds)) once, and (b) current refunded (refunding bonds sold within 90 days of redemption date of
outstanding bonds) without limit. The 2005 bonds were advance refunding bonds so the 2013
refunding bonds would not qualify for tax exemption and would be issued with a taxable status.

Packet Pg. 49

2.11.D

While the potential refunding savings are significant, it is important to note that, such savings are net of
a cost resulting from (a) the inability to invest proceeds of the refunding bonds at a return equal to the
interest rate on the new bonds, and (b) the length of time between the sale of the refunding bonds and
optional redemption date of the 2004 and 2005 Bonds (“Negative Arbitrage”). Absent an increase in
interest rates, the savings to RTD improves with the passage of time due to a reduction in time proceeds
of the refunding bonds must be invested prior to redeeming the 2004 and 2005 Bonds. Despite the cost
associated with the Negative Arbitrage, the potential savings from a refunding of the 2004 and 2005
Bonds exceeds the typical threshold for a refunding by RTD. Consequently, staff has assembled a
financing team and commenced documentation to be in a position to take advantage of the opportunity
for RTD to reduce its interest expense.
The Chief Financial Officer has taken preliminary actions to arrange for the issuance and sale of the
refunding bonds, including assembling financial information related to the District and drafting a
preliminary official statement, bond indenture, continuing disclosure agreement, bond purchase
agreement and the Resolution for issuance of the Bonds. The Board is being requested, through the
Resolution to authorize the issuance, to establish the terms and to approve agreements required in
connection with the issuance of the Bonds.
Drafts of documents referenced in the Bond Resolution including the Bond Indenture, the Continuing
Disclosure Agreement, the Preliminary Official Statement and the Bond Purchase Agreement are
available for review in the Board Office.
RTD is receiving the advice of First Southwest Company, as independent financial advisors and Sherman
& Howard L.L.C. as Bond Counsel in regard to the Bonds. The Bonds will be underwritten by a team
including Goldman Sachs, Loop Capital, Piper Jaffray and Wells Fargo.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
Costs associated with the refunding bonds are considered “costs of issuance” and will be funded out of
Bond proceeds. These costs include underwriter, rating agency, financial advisory, attorney and printing
fees.
ALTERNATIVES:
1. Authorize the execution of documents, including the attached Resolution No.__, Series of 2013,
authorizing the issuance of the District’s Taxable Sales Tax Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series
2013A. This is the recommended action.
2. Do not authorize the execution of documents, including the attached Resolution No.__, Series of
2013, authorizing the issuance of the District’s Taxable Sales Tax Revenue Refunding Bonds,
Series 2013A. This is not the recommended action as it would not take advantage of the interest
expense savings currently available to the District.

become available for payment of defaulted interest, and notice of the Special Record Date shall
be given to the registered owners of the Refunding Bonds not less than 10 days prior thereto by
mail to each such registered owner as shown on the Bond Registrar’s registration records on a
date selected by the Trustee, stating the date of the Special Record Date and the date fixed for the
payment of defaulted interest. The principal and Redemption Price of, and interest on, all
Refunding Bonds shall also be payable at any other place which may be provided for such
payment by the appointment of any other Paying Agent or Paying Agents as permitted by the
Sales Tax Revenue Bond Resolution.
6.
The Refunding Bonds shall be subject to optional redemption prior
to their respective maturity dates and mandatory sinking fund redemption if so provided in the
Sale Certificate.
7.
The Refunding Bonds shall be issued in fully registered form as to
principal and interest and shall be exchangeable and transferable only for fully registered
Refunding Bonds of the same maturity of any authorized denominations and, except as set forth
in this section, upon the terms and conditions otherwise provided in Article III and Article IV of
the Sales Tax Revenue Bond Resolution, as amended.
8.
At the time of initial delivery of the Refunding Bonds to the
Underwriters, if so provided in a Sale Certificate, the Refunding Bonds may be accompanied by
Registered Coupons evidencing additional interest on all or any portion of the Refunding Bonds.
The Registered Coupons shall be in fully registered form (i.e., registered as to payment of the
supplemental interest) provided that no Registered Coupon shall be issued for more than one due
date. The Registered Coupons shall be dated as of the date of delivery of the Refunding Bonds.
The Registered Coupons shall be numbered in such a manner as the District shall determine.
Each Registered Coupon shall entitle the registered owner thereof to receive payment of a
portion of the interest payable with respect to the Refunding Bonds as described herein. The
Registered Coupons may be owned, transferred and presented for payment separately from the
Refunding Bonds. References in this Resolution to the Refunding Bonds shall be deemed to
include the Registered Coupons where the context so requires. Except as specifically provided
herein or in the Registered Coupons, no provision of this Resolution relating to the Refunding
Bonds shall be deemed to affect the rights of the owners of Registered Coupons to receive
payments as provided herein.

forth in the Sale Certificate.

registered in the name of the Securities Depository or a nominee therefor. Purchases by
Beneficial Owners of the Refunding Bonds shall be made in book-entry form in the principal
amount of $5,000 or any integral multiple thereof. The Beneficial Owners shall not receive
certificates evidencing their interests in the Refunding Bonds. No Refunding Bond shall be
issued in a denomination larger than the aggregate principal amount maturing on the maturity
date of such Refunding Bond, and no Refunding Bond shall be made payable on more than one

maturity date and bearing interest at the same interest rate. So long as any Refunding Bond or
Registered Coupon is registered in the name of the Securities Depository or a nominee therefor,
the Securities Depository shall disburse any payments received, through Participants or
otherwise, to the Beneficial Owners. None of the District, the Trustee, the Bond Registrar or the
Paying Agent shall have any responsibility or obligation for the payment to any Participant, any
Beneficial Owner or any other person (except the registered owner in whose name any
Refunding Bonds or Registered Coupons are registered) of the principal of, interest on or any
premium due in connection with the redemption of the Refunding Bonds. The Refunding Bonds
shall be initially issued so that a single Refunding Bond shall evidence the obligation of the
District to pay all principal due on each of the maturity dates for which the Refunding Bonds
bear the same interest rate, and the Registered Coupons initially shall be evidenced by one
Registered Coupon for each payment date for which a Registered Coupon becomes due, as set
forth in the Sale Certificate. Each such Refunding Bond or Registered Coupon shall be
registered in the name of the Securities Depository or a nominee therefor. Except as hereinafter
provided, all of the Refunding Bonds and Registered Coupons shall continue to be registered in
the name of the Securities Depository or a nominee therefor. To the extent typewritten
Refunding Bonds, rather than printed Refunding Bonds, are to be issued, such modifications to
the form of the Refunding Bond as may be necessary or desirable in such case are hereby
authorized and approved. There shall be no substantive change to the terms and conditions set
forth in the form of Refunding Bond, except as otherwise authorized by the Sales Tax Revenue
Bond Resolution.
The District, the Trustee, the Bond Registrar and the Paying Agent shall have no
responsibility or obligation with respect to the accuracy of the records of the Securities
Depository or a nominee therefor or any Participant with respect to any ownership interest in the
Refunding Bonds or the Registered Coupons or the delivery to any Participant, Beneficial Owner
or any other person (except the registered owner in whose name any Refunding Bonds are
registered) of any notice with respect to the Refunding Bonds, including any notice of
redemption.
The District may remove the Securities Depository and the Securities Depository
may resign by giving sixty (60) days’ written notice to the other of such removal or resignation.
Additionally, the Securities Depository shall be removed sixty (60) days after receipt by the
District of written notice from the Securities Depository to the effect that the Securities
Depository has received written notice from Participants having interests, as shown in the
records of the Securities Depository, in an aggregate principal amount of not less than 50% of
the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Refunding Bonds to the effect that the
Securities Depository is unable or unwilling to discharge its responsibilities or a continuation of
the requirement that all of the outstanding Refunding Bonds be registered in the name of the
Securities Depository or a nominee therefor is not in the best interests of the Beneficial Owners.
Upon the removal or resignation of the Securities Depository, the Securities Depository shall
take such action as may be necessary to assure the orderly transfer of the computerized bookentry system with respect to the Refunding Bonds and the Registered Coupons to a successor
securities depository or if no successor securities depository is appointed as herein provided, the
transfer of the Refunding Bonds and Registered Coupons in certificate form to the Beneficial
Owners or their designees. Upon the giving of notice by the District of the removal of the
Securities Depository, the giving of notice by the Securities Depository of its resignation or the

receipt by the District of notice with respect to the written notice of Participants referred to
herein, the District may, within sixty (60) days after the giving of such notice, appoint a
successor securities depository upon such terms and conditions as the District shall impose. Any
such successor securities depository shall at all times be a registered clearing agency under the
Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or other applicable statute or regulation, and
in good standing thereunder. If the District fails to appoint a successor securities depository
within such time period, the Refunding Bonds and the Registered Coupons shall no longer be
restricted to being registered in the name of the Securities Depository or a nominee therefor, but
may be registered in whatever name or names registered owners transferring or exchanging
Refunding Bonds or Registered Coupons shall designate.
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Sales Tax Revenue Bond Resolution
to the contrary, so long as any Refunding Bond is registered in the name of Cede & Co., as
nominee for the Securities Depository, all payments with respect to principal of, interest on and
any premium due in connection with the redemption of such Refunding Bond and all notices
with respect to such Refunding Bond shall be made and given, respectively, in the manner
provided in the Letter of Representations.
11.
The creation, perfection, enforcement, and priority of the pledge of
revenues to secure or pay the Refunding Bonds and the Registered Coupons as provided herein
shall be governed by Section 11-57-208 of the Supplemental Act and the Sales Tax Revenue
Bond Resolution. The revenues pledged for the payment of the Refunding Bonds and the
Registered Coupons, as received by or otherwise credited to the District, shall immediately be
subject to the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery, filing, or further act. The lien of
such pledge on the revenues pledged for payment of the Refunding Bonds and the Registered
Coupons and the obligation to perform the contractual provisions made herein and in the Sales
Tax Revenue Bond Resolution shall have priority over any or all other obligations and liabilities
of the District, except for the Senior Bonds, which shall have a lien on such revenues on a parity
with the Refunding Bonds and Registered Coupons, and except as otherwise provided herein.
The lien of such pledge shall be valid, binding, and enforceable as against all persons having
claims of any kind in tort, contract, or otherwise against the District irrespective of whether such
persons have notice of such liens.
203. Requirements of a Surety Bond or Reserve Fund Insurance Policy. If it is
determined pursuant to Section 201 hereof that a surety bond or reserve fund insurance policy will
be deposited in the Reserve Fund for all or any portion of the Reserve Fund Requirement relating to
the Bonds and the Prior Parity Bonds, the General Manager or Chief Financial Officer may
independently determine the terms of any agreement with the provider of such surety bond or
reserve fund insurance policy as necessary to satisfy such provider’s commitment requirements
to issue its surety bond or policy.

and such bonds shall not be deemed to be outstanding for the purpose of the calculation of
outstanding bonds. No such modification or amendment shall permit a change in the terms of
redemption or maturity of the principal of any outstanding bond or of any installment of interest
thereon or a reduction in the principal amount or redemption price thereof or in the rate of
interest thereon without the consent of the holder of such bond, or shall reduce the percentages or
otherwise affect the classes of bonds the consent of the holders of which is required to effect any
such modification or amendment, or shall change or modify any of the rights or obligations of
the Trustee or of any Paying Agent without its written assent thereto. The Registered Owner of
this bond irrevocably waives the right to exchange this bond for a coupon bond or bonds.
The bonds are issuable in the form of fully registered bonds without coupons in
denominations of $5,000 or any integral multiples of $5,000. This bond is transferable as
provided in the Sales Tax Revenue Bond Resolution, only upon the books of the District kept for
that purpose at the above-mentioned office of the Trustee, by the Registered Owner hereof in
person, or by his duly authorized attorney, upon surrender of this bond together with a written
instrument of transfer satisfactory to the Trustee duly executed by the Registered Owner or his
duly authorized attorney, and thereupon a new registered bond or bonds, and in the same
aggregate principal amount bearing the same interest rate, shall be issued to the transferee in
exchange therefor as provided in the Sales Tax Revenue Bond Resolution, and upon payment of
the charges therein prescribed. The Registered Owner of any bond or bonds may surrender the
same (together with a written instrument of transfer satisfactory to the Trustee duly executed by
the Registered Owner or his or her duly authorized attorney), at the above-mentioned office of
the Trustee, in exchange for an equal aggregate principal amount of registered bonds bearing the
same interest rate, of any of the authorized denominations, in the manner, subject to the
conditions and upon the payment of the charges provided in the Sales Tax Revenue Bond
Resolution. The District, the Trustee and any Paying Agent may deem and treat the person in
whose name this bond is registered as the absolute owner hereof for the purpose of receiving
payment of, or on account of, the principal or redemption price hereof and interest due hereon
and for all other purposes.
The bonds of the issue of which this bond is one are payable upon redemption at
the above-mentioned office of the Paying Agent. The Trustee shall mail, by registered or first
class, postage prepaid mail, a copy of any notice of redemption, postage prepaid, not less than
25 days before the redemption date, to the Registered Owners of any bonds or portions of bonds
which are to be redeemed, at their last addresses, appearing upon the registry books, but failure
to give such notice shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other
bonds. If notice of redemption shall have been mailed as aforesaid, the bonds or portions thereof

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: February 7, 2013

From:

Terry Howerter, Chief Financial Officer

GM

Date:

February 7, 2013

Board Meeting Date: February 14, 2013

Subject:

Resolution No.__, Series of 2013 related to the
issuance of RTD Sales Tax Revenue Refunding
Bonds (FasTracks Projects), Series 2013A

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Resolution”), authorizing the issuance of Regional
Transportation District Tax-Exempt Sales Tax Revenue Refunding Bonds (FasTracks Projects), Series
2013A.
BACKGROUND:
On January 22, 2013, staff presented the refinancing of three RTD debt issues at lower than current
interest rates to reduce payments, improve cash flow, and provide additional capacity under TABOR as a
Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM) item and proposed to use the financing capacity generated by the
refundings as a step toward accelerating construction of the North Metro Rail Line from Denver Union
Station to 72nd Avenue.
This action item discusses the second of the three bond refunding opportunities that were included in
the RAM item proposed on January 22, 2013.
DISSCUSSION:
RTD issued its $600 million Sales Tax Revenue Bonds (FasTracks Project) Series 2006A (the “2006
Bonds”) in October 2006 for the purpose of financing a portion of the costs of the FasTracks projects. In
2007, interest rates were such that the District refunded $363.725 million of the 2006 Bonds to
capture $11.373 million in present value savings (3.122% of principal of refunded bonds). At present,
$235.735 million par amount of the 2006 Bonds remain outstanding.
With long-term interest rates near historic lows, RTD has the potential to advance refund the remaining
outstanding 2006 Bonds on a non-callable basis to realize, subject to market movement, a savings of
approximately $63.8 million (9.03% of principal of refunded bonds). The Bond Resolution requires a
minimum of 3% savings which allows some flexibility in regards to changes in interest rates between
now and the date the bonds are sold. The 2006 Bonds are callable November 1, 2016 at par. Pursuant
to U.S. Treasury regulations, an issue of tax-exempt bonds may (a) be advance refunded (refunding
bonds sold more than 90 days in advance of the redemption date of the outstanding bonds)) once, and
(b) current refunded (refunding bonds sold within 90 days of redemption date of outstanding bonds)
without limit.
While the potential refunding savings are significant, it is important to note that, such savings are net of
a cost resulting from (a) the inability to invest proceeds of the refunding bonds at a return equal to the
interest rate on the new bonds, and (b) the length of time between the sale of the refunding bonds and
optional redemption date of the 2006 Bonds (“Negative Arbitrage”). Absent a change in interest rates,

Packet Pg. 92

2.11.E

the savings to RTD improves with the passage of time, due to a reduction in time proceeds of the
refunding bonds must be invested prior to redeeming the 2006 Bonds. Despite the cost associated with
the Negative Arbitrage, the potential savings from a refunding of the 2006 Bonds exceeds the typical
threshold for a refunding by RTD. Consequently, staff has assembled a financing team and commenced
documentation to be in a position to take advantage of the opportunity for RTD to reduce its interest
expense.
The Chief Financial Officer has taken preliminary actions to arrange for the issuance and sale of the
bonds, including assembling financial information related to the District and drafting a preliminary official
statement, bond indenture, continuing disclosure agreement, bond purchase agreement and the
Resolution for issuance of the Bonds. The Board is being requested, through the Resolution to authorize
the issuance, to establish the terms and to approve agreements required in connection with the issuance
of the Bonds.
Drafts of documents referenced in the Bond Resolution including the Bond Indenture, the Continuing
Disclosure Agreement, the Preliminary Official Statement and the Bond Purchase Agreement are
available for review in the Board Office.
RTD is receiving the advice of First Southwest Company, as independent financial advisors and Sherman
& Howard L.L.C. as Bond Counsel in regard to the Bonds. The Bonds will be underwritten by a team
including Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, George K. Baum and Loop Capital.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
Costs associated with the refunding bonds are considered “costs of issuance” and will be funded out of
Bond proceeds. These costs include underwriter, rating agency, financial advisory, attorney and printing
fees.
ALTERNATIVES:
1. Authorize the execution of documents, including the attached Resolution No.__, Series of 2013,
authorizing the issuance of the District’s Tax-Exempt Sales Tax Revenue Refunding Bonds
(FasTracks Project), Series 2013A. This is the recommended action.
2. Do not authorize the execution of documents, including the attached Resolution No.__, Series of
2013, authorizing the issuance of the District’s Tax-Exempt Sales Tax Revenue Refunding Bonds
(FasTracks Project), Series 2013A. This is not the recommended action as it would not take
advantage of the interest expense savings currently available to the District.

Board Meeting Date: February 14, 2013

Subject:

Amendment to MV Public Transportation ADA
Contract ADA 17-DH-007 for award of the
Belmar, Green Mountain and Golden Call-nRides.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations & Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute a contract amendment with MV Public
Transportation for the provision of the “Belmar”, “Green Mountain” and “Golden” Call-n-Ride
contracted demand response transit services under the existing MV Public Transportation ADA
contract. This contract amendment is for a nine (9) month period from April 2013 through December
2013. The cost for the Belmar Call-n-Ride service will not exceed $183,420, Green Mountain Call-nRide will not exceed $293,172 and Golden Call-n-Ride will not exceed $234,214. The total not to
exceed amount will be $710,806. These amounts include estimates for fuel costs that are treated
as “pass through” expenses.
BACKGROUND
As a supplement to RTD fixed-route service, RTD also operates “Call-n-Ride” service in various
locations throughout the District. Rather than operating on a fixed route and schedule, demand
responsive, or “Call-n-Ride” service can be described as shared-ride public transit service provided in
a defined service area that requires that the passenger telephone the service provider to arrange for
pick-up. In addition to having a Call-n-Ride vehicle in a service area, Call-n-Rides can also operate as
Flex Routes. A Flex Route is an established route that has assigned stops and times just like a
regular route.
With the opening of the West Line on April 28, 2013, Call-n-Ride service has been planned to serve
areas along the corridor and to provide feeder service to West Rail Line stations. The Belmar Call-n-Ride
will operate Monday-Friday, 5:30am – 8:00pm. The base Call-n-Ride service area will be bounded on the
north by 13th Avenue, Wadsworth Blvd. on the east, Kipling Street on the west and Morrison Road on
the south. The Belmar Call-n-Ride will also operate a Flex Route on Garrison Street during peak hours
and will serve the Garrison Station. The Green Mountain Call-n-Ride will operate Monday-Friday,
5:30am – 8:00pm. The base Call-n-Ride service area will be 6th Avenue on the north, Kipling Blvd. on
the east, Union Blvd to Alameda Pkwy on the west and Morrision Road on the south. Two Flex Routes
have been established: one will cover parts of the discontinued Route 2X and will operate into the
Federal Center. A second Flex Route will cover discontinued parts of the Route 14 between Kipling and
the Federal Center Station. The Golden Call-n-Ride will operate Monday-Friday, 5:30am-8:00pm and
Saturday 8:00am-11:00pm. The base service area will cover most of the City of Golden. A Flex Route
will operate in Golden serving the Jefferson County Government Center/Golden Station, Human
Services, Colorado School of Mines, 10th & Washington and Golden High School. Other RTD services in
the areas consist of fixed route, Access-a-Ride and the new light rail.
DISCUSSION
MV Transportation currently operates Access-a-Ride services and eleven (11) other Call-n-Rides that
serve the southern and western areas of the RTD District under their existing ADA contract. MV

Packet Pg. 105

2.11.F

Transportation is an experienced provider in Call-n-Ride service, and in opening new services it is
imperative that our customers receive the best service possible. With the opening of the light rail,
customers will be learning a new system and these Call-n-Rides will provide an integral part of their
commute. Having an experienced Call-n-Ride provider on opening day is crucial. MV has the
additional resources to handle issues that come up with opening new services. MV Transportation
operates all the Call-n-Rides on the southeast and southwest light rail lines. Maintaining the same
contractor to operate all the Call-n-Rides in the south and west areas, allows for better transfers and
coordination among the Call-n-Rides.
Assigning the West Line Call-n-Rides to MV Transportation is in RTD’s best interest as 1) they are an
experienced Call-n-Ride provider, 2) the continued provision of these services allows for the efficient
utilization of vehicles, including spares, and allows for dependable service delivery, and 3) the provision
of these Call-n-Ride services through the existing ADA contract will enable the RTD to keep the cost at
$41.96 per revenue service hour.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for the provision of the West Line Call-n-Rides services are included in the adopted 2013 RTD
budget. Funds will be requested in future budgets for the provision of service in future years. The
City of Golden did receive a CMAQ grant for the Golden Call-n-Ride service. The grant funds will be
used to offset the costs of the Golden Call-n-Ride service.
ALTERNATIVES
1)
Award the contract to MV Transportation under their ADA contract. This is recommended
as it is in the best interest of our customer and the best use of vehicle resources.
2)
Award the contract to another ADA service provider through an existing ADA contract at
existing rates. This is not recommended as the customer would ultimately suffer because
there is no other contractor with the Call-n-Ride experience that MV Transportation offers.

Contract Award to HNTB Corporation for
Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS)

General

GM
Board Meeting Date: February 14, 2013

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager to approve a thirteen-month professional services contract award to HNTB
Corporation to serve as the consultant for the Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS) for an amount
not to exceed $2,022,091. It is further recommended that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the
transfer of $2.5 million from the Transit Development Reserve to fund the consultant contract, staff
time and specialized on-call modeling support for the NAMS. These funds will be replenished in the
2013 Amended Budget with proceeds of the sale of the air rights at Civic Center Station.
BACKGROUND
One year ago, when the RTD Board was considering seeking a tax increase from District voters to
accelerate the completion of the FasTracks program, it became clear that, even with additional
revenue, the completion date for the Northwest Rail would be well into the future. To address
stakeholder concerns, RTD proposed a hybrid option that would provide early implementation of Bus
Rapid Transit (BRT) improvements that could address mobility needs since the completion of the rail
would be delayed.
Since the Board opted not to pursue an election, the Northwest area stakeholders have requested
that RTD evaluate a range of mobility options in the in the Northwest Area. The NAMS is RTD’s
response to that request. Specifically, the study will focus on the following elements:
1. Evaluate overall mobility options in the Northwest Area;
2. Determine how the remaining FasTracks US 36 BRT commitment will be allocated to the corridor and
determine what remaining BRT elements are needed;
3. Evaluate the feasibility and determine the cost associated with constructing the Northwest Rail Line
in segments;
4. Evaluate the possibility for extending the North Metro Rail Line to Longmont;
5. Conduct a high-level feasibility analysis of the reverse commute issues on the I-25 Downtown
Express lanes.
Funding for this study was established in November 2012, when the Board authorized the sale of the
air rights at Civic Center Station, and stipulated that a portion of the proceeds be used to pay for the
study.
DISCUSSION
RTD issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) in December 2012 for consultant assist ance for this study.
A committee, comprised of representatives from RTD staff, CDOT staff and three representatives
from the local jurisdictions, reviewed proposals submitted by consultant teams in a qualifications based selection process. The evaluation considered each team’s technical proposal in the areas of

Packet Pg. 107

2.12.G

Key Personnel Qualifications, Project Understanding and Approach, Team Qualifications, DBE
Commitment, Schedule, and Innovation. The five proposing teams were led by the following
companies: CH2M Hill, HDR, HNTB Corporation, IBI Group, and Steer Davies Gleave. The selection
committee short-listed three teams for interviews and is now recommending that the team led by
HNTB Corporation be approved by the Board. Staff is requesting that the Board app rove this
recommendation and authorize the General Manager to negotiate a contract not to exceed
$2,022,091. Upon successful negotiations, the study will begin immediately and is expected to be
completed by early 2014.
As noted above, the study will have five key components:
1. Evaluate overall mobility options in the Northwest Area;
2. Determine how the remaining FasTracks US 36 BRT commitment will be allocated to the corridor and
determine what remaining BRT elements are needed;
3. Evaluate the feasibility and determine the cost associated with constructing the Northwest Rail Line
in segments;
4. Evaluate the possibility for extending the North Metro Rail Line to Longmont;
5. Conduct a high-level feasibility analysis of the reverse commute issues on the I-25 Downtown
Express lanes.
The NAMS was assigned a 22% Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) goal. HNTB has committed to
meeting this goal and conducted its own Business Outreach Open House to generate interest in teaming
opportunities for this project. Of the nine DBE firms selected for this team, four are new partners with
HNTB.
The final product of this study will be a prioritized list of improvements for the Northwest area of the
district that has the overall support of RTD, CDOT and our project stakeholders. For each improvement
on this list, the consultant team will develop base year capital and operations and maintenance (O&M)
cost estimates and conduct fatal flaw analyses of technical, financial and environmental issues related to
the improvements.
The data gathered/developed for this study will be essential in informing future RTD decisions related to
the timing for the completion of the FasTracks program that will be grounded in corridor-wide consensus
among study stakeholders. This information will help RTD evaluate future federal grant funding
opportunities, and will provide the private sector with helpful information for determining the feasibility
of future unsolicited proposals or public/private partnerships.
Once a prioritized list of improvements is developed as part of this study, including base year capital and
O&M cost estimates, RTD will then conduct financial analyses [as part of the next Annual Program
Evaluation (APE), not as part of this study], which will reflect various implementation schedules for
completing the remaining FasTracks projects (assuming no additional sales and use tax election).
Specific timing for completion of the remaining FasTracks projects will be determined by the RTD Board
of Directors through the APE process and will be presented for public comment during RTD Board
meetings in late 2013/early 2014, and through the SB 208 submittal due to DRCOG in early 2014.
It should be noted that adding or removing projects from the 2004 FasTracks program could require
approval by residents through a district-wide election, and RTD cannot include improvements that are
not part of the FasTracks program in the SB 208 report to be submitted in early 2014. However if, as
part of this study, RTD and our stakeholders gain consensus that providing cost effective mobility

Packet Pg. 108

2.12.G

improvements in the Northwest area would require a change to the original FasTracks plan, then RTD
staff will present the proposed change in scope to the RTD Board. If the RTD Board approves the
proposed change, then they would have the option to include the scope change in a future election, if
the RTD Board decides to pursue an election at some time in the future. RTD can also consider
submitting any new projects, not part of FasTracks, to DRCOG for inclusion in the longer-term 2040
DRCOG Metro Vision Plan, to be funded outside of FasTracks revenues.
Before any specific project can be advanced into the construction stage, additional environmental
and engineering design work (both of which will require public input) will be required.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for this study is provided through the sale of the air rights at Civic Center Station. The air rights
sale was completed too late for the sale proceeds and project costs to be included in the 2013 Adopted
Budget, so the project funding will be provided through a transfer from the Transit Development Reserve
until the sale proceeds can be recognized in the 2013 Amended Budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee
that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to approve a thirteen -month
professional services contract award to HNTB Corporation to serve as the consultant for the
NAMS for an amount not to exceed $2,022,091; and it is further recommended that the Board of
Directors authorize the transfer of $2.5 million from the Transit Development Reserve to fund the
consultant contract, staff time and specialized on-call modeling support for the NAMS. These
funds will be replenished in the 2013 Amended Budget with proceeds of the sale of the air rights
at Civic Center Station.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to approve a
thirteen-month professional services contract award to HNTB Corporation to serve as the
consultant for the NAMS for an amount not to exceed $2,022,091; and do not authorize the
transfer of $2.5 million from the Transit Development Reserve to fund the consultant contract
and staff time for the NAMS from funds that would be in the 2013 Amended Budget with
proceeds of the sale of the air rights at Civic Center Station.
This alternative is not
recommended because it would delay completion of this important study.

Richard F. Clarke, Assistant General Manager

Date:

Board Meeting Date: February 14, 2013

Subject:

Aconex Contract Extension

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager, or designee, to exercise the four option years on the contract with Aconex, in the
total amount of $480,000, for Construction Management Software as a Service, extending the end date
of the contract to April 2017. Funding for this contract in 2013 is included in the 2013 Adopted
Budget, and future year funding will be appropriated on an annual basis.
BACKGROUND
In April 2010, the RTD Board approved the selection of Aconex to provide an online construction and
document management system for the FasTracks Program. The approved contract was for a three year
term with four one year contract options. Aconex was selected because of its ability to easily set up
web based projects, its search capabilities and its ability to cut down on Document Control staffing
needs, all provided at a reasonable cost to the District.
DISCUSSION
Since the implementation of Aconex in 2010, RTD has been using the system on 20 projects for
FasTracks and Capital Programs. Aconex is used on these projects to manage all construction and
project documentation that is submitted from the contractor, stakeholders or RTD staff. This includes
items such as design drawings, contractor submittals, intergovernmental agreements, and required
reporting for the Federal Transit Administration and other federal agencies. RTD currently has over one
million documents stored in Aconex, and over three thousand RTD staff members, contractors and
stakeholders are using the system. In September 2011, RTD was awarded the Best Team Award from
Constructech Magazine for our use of Aconex on our FasTracks projects.
If RTD were to choose not to exercise the option years on the Aconex contract, RTD would be forced to
stand up an alternative document control system for the FasTracks program. This would require system
evaluation, implementation, configuration, testing, training, and migration of all existing documents to
the new system, which would result in considerable cost and disruption to the major construction
projects which are in progress.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The total cost to RTD to exercise all four option years at this time is $480,000, or $120,000 per year
for four years. If RTD were to exercise each individual option year, the total cost of the contract options
would be $600,000, or $150,000 per year. Therefore, RTD would save $120,000 by exercising all four
option years at once.
Funding for this contract in 2013 is included in the 2013 Adopted Budget. Future year funding will be
appropriated on an annual basis.

ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or designee, to exercise the four option
years on the contract with Aconex, in the total amount of $480,000, for Construction Management
Software as a Service, extending the end date of the contract to April 2017. Funding for this
contract in 2013 is included in the 2013 Adopted Budget, and future year funding will be
appropriated on an annual basis.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Exercise the Aconex contract option years on a year by
year basis. This is not recommended because RTD will save $120,000 by exercising all four oneyear options at the same time.
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not exercise any of the contract option years for
Aconex and re-solicit for a new construction and document management system. This is not
recommended due to the level of effort, cost, and disruption to ongoing RTD projects required to
implement a new system.

From:

Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

January 30, 2013

Board Meeting Date: February 14, 2013

Subject:

Senate Bill 13-027 Board Action

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Government Relations Committee that the Board of Directors support Senate
Bill 13-027, concerning the provision of parking facilities by third parties at or near Regional
Transportation District mass transit stations, and allow RTD’s lobbyists and staff to work with legislators
to make any amendments consistent with the Board of Directors’ intent. In addition, RTD would enter
into an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with the City of Boulder (Boulder) that would require
Boulder’s concurrence before any existing RTD owned park-n-Ride could be sold or leased for private
operation under the amended legislation.
BACKGROUND
RTD currently has a limited set of circumstances where it can charge patrons for parking—parking over
24 hours, parking for someone who resides outside the RTD taxing district, and reserved parking spaces
(up to 15 percent of the total number of available spaces). RTD parking facilities are broadly defined by
statute to include facilities owned, leased, or used by RTD. Some municipalities and private developers
have requested RTD’s cooperation in providing opportunities for construction of public pay parking
structures at or near mass transit stations. This could include all RTD patrons, not just those parking for
more than 24 hours or out of district riders.
DISCUSSION
RTD’s restrictions on charging for parking are adding to the challenges of implementing Transit Oriented
Development (TOD) and more specifically of developing parking structures. The language of Senate Bill
13-027 changes the current legislation to allow third parties (local jurisdictions or developers) to be able
to charge for parking for purposes of providing a revenue source for funding parking structures. RTD
would not receive the revenue from the parking fees.
There are several benefits of this bill. Local jurisdictions could facilitate better land use if third parties
construct a structure, rather than RTD building a surface parking lot. Transit patrons and other members
of the public could have more available parking spaces with this private or city involvement as uses
would not have to be clearly segregated. Finally, this bill will allow RTD to manage its resources more
efficiently if we are not expending funds for surface or structured parking.
At the present time, the current situations where the results of passage of this bill may be applicable
include the Boulder Transit Village, Olde Town Arvada TOD Pilot Project (Gold Line), the Westminster
Station (Northwest electrified segment), and the Iliff Station (I-225).
Boulder has requested that RTD enter into an IGA committing that RTD would not allow conversion of
an existing facility in the City to private operation and charges without Boulder’s concurrence. Boulder
would have a 30-day review for any proposals. RTD has two facilities that would be affected by the
proposed IGA, the Table Mesa park-n-Ride and the Tantra Drive park-n-Ride.
FINANCIAL IMPACT

Packet Pg. 124

2.12.I

RTD could realize savings from not needing to construct a parking lot or structure. The third parties
will be constructing the parking structures and collecting the revenues generated to offset the cost of
construction.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Government Relations Committee that
the Board of Directors support Senate Bill 13-027, concerning the provision of parking facilities by
third parties at or near Regional Transportation District mass transit stations, and allow RTD’s
lobbyists and staff to work with legislators to make any amendments consistent with Board of
Directors’ intent. In addition, RTD would enter into an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with the
City of Boulder (Boulder) that would require Boulder’s concurrence before any existing RTD owned
park-n-Ride could be sold or leased for private operation under the amended legislation.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. This action is not recommended because local jurisdictions
desire the ability to make good land use decisions for their communities and facilitate transit oriented
development, and this bill allows RTD the ability to manage its resources more efficiently.

Date:

February 7, 2013

Board Meeting Date: February 14, 2013

Subject:

DBE Committee Name Change

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Committee that the Board of Directors
change the name of the Disadvantage Business Enterprise (DBE) Committee to the Civil Rights
Committee which is more inclusive and comprehensive in scope and responsibilities.
BACKGROUND
The DBE Committee is currently a standing committee, and a quorum is reached with five board
members present. The DBE Committee meets every other month to discuss the policies, procedures and
implementation of RTD’s Small and Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Programs that provide outside
contracting and subcontracting opportunities for small, minority and women owned businesses. The
committee reviews the procedures of the Small Business Office (SBO), the diversity of participation on
RTD Base System and major capital projects such as FasTracks, small business advocacy, compliance
monitoring and the overall efforts of the SBO to assist the growth and development of small and
disadvantaged businesses through the implementation of various technical assistance initiatives. The
committee supports the outreach efforts of the SBO by attending community, organization and
association meetings when required. Designated members attend the quarterly Disadvantaged Business
Enterprise Advisory Committee and provide information on how to do business with RTD to the
community at-large and our Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) stakeholders and other community
partners throughout the metropolitan Denver area.
DISCUSSION
The scope of the DBE Committee has expanded beyond merely receiving reports regarding the Small
Business Office (SBO) and third party business related activities. Currently, the DBE Committee
receives reports from and provides advice on the Title VI Program, Equal Employment Opportunity
(EEO) Program, Workforce Initiative Program (WIN) and all Diversity related matters associated with
RTD’s overall Civil Rights responsibilities. The revised name better describes the role and
responsibilities of the Committee and is comprehensive enough to include future related
responsibilities that may fall under the responsibility of “Civil Rights”. Every other month, meetings
will be helpful to the Board of Directors as they make decisions for the benefit of the agency and the
public we serve.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Executive Committee’s Recommended Action to change the name of the DBE
Committee to the Civil Rights Committee.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action and continue with the DBE Committee as it now
stands.
