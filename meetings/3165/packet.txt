BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
RTD Board’s Position on HB21-1186 Reflecting
Accountability Committee’s Legislative Recommendations

Committee Meeting Date:
March 9, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
March 9, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board to adopt a resolution in support of House Bill 21-1186 titled CONCERNING RELIEVING
THE REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT OF STATUTORY RESTRICTIONS RELATED TO THE
DISTRICT'S OPERATIONS.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Debra A. Johnson, General Manager and CEO
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
On June 16, 2020, the RTD Board of Directors unanimously approved a Proposal creating the
independent Accountability Committee in collaboration with the Governor of Colorado and the
Transportation Chairs of the General Assembly. The purpose of the Committee is to provide an
independent and objective analysis of RTD's operations. In January 2021, the Accountability Committee
issued a Preliminary Report that made initial legislative recommendations for consideration by the
Colorado General Assembly. RTD staff worked closely with the Accountability Committee and the bill
sponsors to provide information and technical input, resulting in HB21-1186 .
DISCUSSION
HB21-1186 proposes several amendments to RTD’s enabling statute in order to provide RTD with
greater flexibility in its operations and revenue generation, and more meaningfully track and report on its
cost efficiency of services provided.
HB21-1186 removes the cap on the amount of all vehicular service RTD can allow to be provided by
third parties under competitive contracts and retains the 58% cap on the amount of fixed route bus
service that may be provided through such contracts. Additionally, the proposed legislation expands the
types of entities RTD may contract with to include non-profit organizations and local governments.
These amendments provide RTD with more flexibility to implement cost-effective mobility solutions
when appropriate.
Second, HB21-1186 repeals the farebox recovery ratio which currently requires that 30% of RTD’s
operating costs be funded by revenues collected. The amendments require RTD to include in its annual
financial reports information on operating costs, ridership numbers, and operating costs divided by
ridership as a measure of cost efficiency of it services.
Third, HB21-1186 eliminates prohibitions on parking reductions associated with residential and
commercial developments at RTD transfer facilities.
Lastly, HB21-1186 removes restrictions related to RTD’s ability to charge fees and manage parking at
RTD parking facilities.

confronting not only the citizens of the metropolitan area but also the

that, although mass transportation is one component of an effective

efficiently, economically, and on a demand-responsive basis and that the

district should consider least-cost alternatives in discharging its

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Amendment to RTD Code of Ethics on Board of Director’s
Financial Disclosures

Committee Meeting Date:
January 21, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
March 9, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt an amendment to the RTD Code of Ethics to provide that the annual
disclosure form for each elected or appointed RTD Director shall be a public record and shall be open for
inspection by any person.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Melanie J. Snyder, General Counsel
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
The RTD Board of Directors adopted a Code of Ethics on February 27, 2018 (the “Code”), applicable to
all employees. The Code includes standards for integrity, honesty, inclusivity, transparency, and
sustainability. It also sets forth certain restrictions on employees who have responsibility for
procurements or who are engaged in the award or administration of contracts, and generally prohibits
RTD from entering into contracts with such employees or with a person or entity in which the employee
has an interest.
The Code includes an Annual Disclosure requirement for employees responsible for procurements or
engaged in the award or administration of contracts. This disclosure form is submitted to the General
Counsel and maintained as a confidential personnel record of the employee. The disclosures are used to
create a list of those persons or entities with whom RTD may be restricted from doing business. The
Proposed transactions are compared with the list to see if there are relationships that could cause a
conflict of interest, in which case the General Counsel and Senior Manager of Materials Manager
consult.
DISCUSSION
RTD Directors are considered employees and are subject to the Annual Disclosure requirement. Recently,
each of the Directors provided consent to release their individual Annual Disclosure form in response to
Colorado Open Records requests. The Board Executive Committee suggests that the Code be amended
to provide that the Annual Disclosure forms for each elected or appointed RTD Director be a public
record open for inspection by any person. This will authorize RTD to release this information without
requesting a Director’s consent.

A.

Introduction

This RTD Code of Ethics provides mandatory standards and guidance on ethical behavior
and choices for all of us at RTD: our employees and directors. We will use this Code of Ethics to
guide our daily decisions and actions.
All of us at RTD are expected to be ethical role models. We must all be alert to potential
ethical issues and be ready to respond appropriately. We must avoid conduct that creates an
appearance of impropriety to a reasonable person. Those of us who supervise others must
foster an atmosphere that encourages everyone to seek help if faced with ethical dilemmas.
Responsibility for compliance with standards for ethical conduct ultimately rests with each one
of us.
A key goal of this Code is to promote integrity by preventing conflicts of interest.
Conflicts between our RTD roles and our private interests, whether real or perceived, must be
avoided.
This Code also supports an environment at RTD of honesty, trust, inclusivity and
sustainability: a just culture with sincere, respectful and open communications.
This Code contains five main parts. The first part identifies five basic ethics standards
that apply to all of us at RTD. The second part contains rules limiting RTD contracts with
current and former RTD employees who have responsibility for or influence upon procurement
decisions, including all RTD managers and directors. The third part concerns annual disclosures
by those with responsibility for procurement decisions. The fourth part explains how to get
advice about the Code and states how RTD enforces the Code, including penalties for violation.
The fifth part provides more resources to help interpret the Code, including citations to relevant
legal standards.
The rules in this Code are simple, reasonable, and grounded in common
sense. This Code clearly states expectations for all RTD employees. A claim of lack of
knowledge or understanding of this Code will not be accepted.
No code of ethics can anticipate every possible situation, and this Code of Ethics does
not repeal other rules relating to ethical conduct that may apply. We must be familiar and
comply with all laws, standards and rules related to our specific jobs. To help in applying the
rules in this Code, RTD’s General Counsel will issue comments and examples applying the Code
to situations that may come up. These comments and examples will be approved by the Senior
Leadership Team as official RTD procedures. In addition, RTD provides ethics training and
resources to apply this Code to situations you are likely to encounter. If you are ever unsure
whether anything you do may violate this Code, contact RTD’s General Counsel for a written
advisory opinion before you take action.
This 2018 revision of RTD’s Code of Ethics was led by an RTD Leadership Academy team

comments from others, the Code of Ethics was approved and adopted by RTD’s Board of
Directors on February 27, 2018.

B.

Five Basic Ethics Standards for All of Us at RTD

This part of the Code contains five basic ethics standards that apply to each of us: all
RTD employees regardless of position, plus RTD directors (also referred to as “employees” in
this part). These standards are: integrity, honesty, inclusivity, transparency, and sustainability.

1. Integrity

against the matter, and shall not vote in respect to such matter.
Section 2. Official Interest Only.

any municipality or other public body or the federal government, nor the
owning of any property within the State of Colorado shall be deemed a
disqualification for membership on the Board of Directors or employment
