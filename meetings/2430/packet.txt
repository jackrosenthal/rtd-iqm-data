1.B.1.a

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT

WHEREAS, House Bill 16-1008 was drafted and submitted to the General Assembly by the
Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT), in partnership with RTD, and the State
Highway Patrol. This bill will change language in the CDOT enabling legislation, as CDOT has
direct control over the ability of vehicles to operate on the shoulders of state roadways. The
bill was heard on January 27, 2016, in the House Transportation Committee and passed by a
vote of 11-2.
WHEREAS, The provisions of House Bill 16-1008 will give RTD bus operators the option of
driving on the shoulders of US 36 only under certain conditions. Bus travel on the shoulders
can be done only when traffic in the general purpose lanes is travelling 35 miles per hour or
less, and it is up to the bus operator to determine if these conditions exist and if it is safe to
drive on the shoulder. The bus can then travel on the shoulder at a speed only 15 miles per
hour above the speed of the traffic in the general purpose lanes.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that RTD Board of Directors adopts a position in support of
House Bill 16-1008 that will permit the Bus On Shoulder operations along US 36 for the voterapproved Bus Rapid Transit service, which is a part of the Board-approved Flatiron Flyer service
package.
Passed and adopted by the Board of Directors of the Regional Transportation District on this
16th day of February 2016.

Resolution SB 16-011 (DOCX)

Prepared by:
Sherry Ellebracht, Government Relations Officer

Approved by:

Packet Pg. 5

1.B.2.a

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT

WHEREAS, Senate Bill 16-011 eliminates annual transfers of $15.0 million for transit projects
from fee revenue imposed under the Funding Advancements for Surface Transportation and
Economic Recovery Act of 2009 (FASTER). This includes a $10.0 million transfer to the
Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) for transit related projects and $5.0
million for local transit projects.

WHEREAS, Senate Bill 16-011 is currently making its way through the Colorado General
Assembly. This bill would have a negative effect on RTD. RTD receives a minimum $3 million
allocation annually and then can compete in the approximately $2 million statewide
competitive pool. If RTD did not receive these additional funds each year, various projects
could not be completed. Projects that are currently in the pipeline for future allocations would
have to be delayed, or funds would need to be diverted from other capital projects to complete
the necessary work.

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that the RTD Board of Directors takes a position in
opposition to Senate Bill 16-011.

Passed and adopted by the Board of Directors of the Regional Transportation District on this
16th day of February 2016.

From: Brandeberry McKenna Public Affairs (BBMK)
Date: January 26, 2016

1. De-Brief of the RTD and Colorado General Assembly Legislative Event at Union
Station.
2. We will provide an update on any related actions on these bills since this agenda was
submitted.


HB16-1008 Roadway Shoulder Access for Buses sponsored by Reps. Winter and
J Becker and Senators Cooke and Heath is scheduled for a hearing on January 27th
in the House Transportation and Energy Committee at 1:30pm. BBMK has been
working closely with Rep. Winter on this legislation and is continuing to lobby all
the members of the Committee in conjunction with CDOT for the passage of the
bill.



HB16-1087 Increase Vendor Fee for Collecting State Sales Tax sponsored by
Rep. J Becker was introduced and assigned to both the House State Veterans and
Military Affairs Committee and the House Finance Committee. The bill increases
the amount a retailer can retain from 3 1/3 % to 5 ½% gradually over a period of
five years.



HB16-1097 PUC Permit for Medicaid Transportation Providers sponsored by
Reps. Coram and Moreno and Senator Scott is scheduled for a hearing in the
House Transportation and Energy Committee upon adjournment on February 4th.
The bill creates a new category of limited regulation carriers that allows providers
of nonemergency transportation to Medicaid clients to operate under a limited
regulation permit from the PUC rather than a certificate of public convenience
and necessity. The Department is running this legislation to increase the pool of
carriers that provide non emergent transportation.



SB16-011 Terminate the Use of FASTER fee Revenue for Transit sponsored by
Rep. Neville and Senator Neville is scheduled for a hearing in Senate
Transportation Committee on January 26th at 1:30pm. This bill repeals the
statutory provisions that require the transit related uses of the fee revenue.



SB16-037 Public Access Digitally Stored Data Under CORA sponsored by
Senator Kefalas and Rep. Pabon was introduced and assigned to the State
Veterans and Military Affairs Committee. The bill would amend the Colorado
Open Records Act to require that public records kept in digital form be made
available, in whole or in part to a records requester via “direct electronic access”

FEDERAL UPDATE FOR REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT: FEBRUARY 2, 2016
FAST Act Implementation:


There have been few public announcements from the Federal Transit Administration on its
FAST Act implementation efforts. Importantly, we still await release of the agency’s
apportionment notice releasing transit formula funds authorized under the FAST Act for the
remainder of FY 2016.





With the release of the President’s FY 2017 Budget Proposal set for February 9, US DOT
has begun to unveil some of the Obama Administration’s final-year transportation priorities,
including an enormous ($4 billion over 10 years) program to develop standards for
deployment of autonomous vehicles (driverless cars).
While there have been no announcements yet of any transit initiatives, we fully expect
funding for the Eagle FFGA to be included in the President’s Budget.
