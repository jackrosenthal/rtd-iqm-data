“What are Quiet Zones?”
Regulatory rule allowing for no horn use by train operator under normal
operating conditions
Exceptions include:
•

If PTC on the train doesn’t initialize or drops during the trip
the FRA requires the train operator to sound horns at the crossing or
adhere to the requirements spelled out in FRA 49 CFR 222.23:

Enter Presentation Title
Title Case
§ (a)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, a
locomotive engineer may sound the locomotive horn to provide a
warning to animals, vehicle operators, pedestrians, trespassers or
crews on other trains in an emergency situation if, in the
locomotive engineer's sole judgment, such action is appropriate
in order to prevent imminent injury, death, or property damage.

§ (b)(2) When active grade crossing warning devices have
malfunctioned and use of the horn is required by specific sections
of this chapter: §§234.105, 234.106, or 234.107
