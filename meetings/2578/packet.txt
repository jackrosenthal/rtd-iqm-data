Fare Enforcement Statistics
Fare inspectors, security officers, street supervisors, and police officers, conduct fare inspection onboard buses and light rail vehicles. RTD’s policy is to provide a warning to first time offenders and then
to issue a citation if that person is contacted a second time without fare. The table below shows the
actual number of patrons without fare that resulted in warnings or citations. The variation in numbers
from month to month may be due to several factors: special events or other security security-related
incidents.

Light Rail Station and Commuter Rail Platform Sweeps and on-Board Enforcement Sweeps
In addition to the regular on-board fare enforcement, security officers conduct random, unannounced
fare checks at light rail and commuter rail 11platforms twice a week. Below are the numbers of patrons
contacted during the quarter. Any area that exhibits a higher fare evasion rate, we go back to that area
and conduct an on-board enforcement sweep.

Plain Clothes Police Officer Fare Inspection
Police Officers are placed on bus and rail vehicles that have been identified by operators, supervisors,
dispatch logs and patrons as having a high perception of fare evasion, fare disputes or other problems.
The following tables lists the number of patron boardings observed, no fare or partial fares, the
estimated fare evasion rate, the number of warnings and citations issued, and the number of arrests
made by police officers. Arrests include citations issued or physical arrests made for criminal violations
other than fare evasion. This is an additional advantage to the plain clothes police fare inspection
program as peace officers have the authority to check for warrants and take the appropriate law
enforcement action. This quarter the bus routes inspected include the 15, 16, 31 & 0.

The below chart shows the plain clothes police fare enforcement observations for light rail. There is a
slightly higher fare evasion rate observed by the plain clothes program than for the rail station sweeps
and bus enforcement because of the following factors:
 Fare station sweeps are conducted by uniformed security officers; these officers require all
patrons to have fare before boarding vehicles
 Rail operators do not have any interface with patrons, while bus operators do ask for fare
 Plain clothes police officers do not have a deterrence factor as uniformed officers, thus they
inherently find more violations of fare evasion.

Security Officer Use of Force Incidents
Use of Force is defined as any hands on touching of a suspect by a security officer to detain a suspect
or make a citizen’s arrest. The majority of these issues are minor in nature. No injuries to any suspect
or officer occurred in this reporting quarter. The following table summarizes the use of force incidents
per month.
