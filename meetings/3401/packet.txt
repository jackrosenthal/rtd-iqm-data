BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Strategic Plan Survey Results and Data Evaluation

Committee Meeting Date:
February 17, 2022

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Debra A. Johnson, General Manager and CEO
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
In adopting a five-year strategic plan, the Board established four strategic priorities and their associated
success outcomes that the agency will collectively strive to achieve:
Strategic Priority
Community Value: RTD strives to be a strong
community partner,
providing value to
customers as well as to the broader Denver
Metro region while sustaining planet Earth

Success Outcome
Establish baseline for Community
Value Index and Increase by 5%

Customer
Excellence:
RTD
strives
to
consistently deliver high-quality customer
service

Establish Baseline for Customer Net
Promoter Score and Increase by 5%

Employee Ownership: RTD seeks to attract and
retain a highly skilled and engaged workforce

Establish Baseline for Employee Net
Promoter Score and Increase by 5%

Financial Success: RTD takes very seriously the
management of all financial resources

50% of outcome is that RTD
spends less money than it receives;
50% of outcome is that the
community believes that it sees
value in RTD’s spending

DISCUSSION
In order to establish baseline levels for the metrics used to gauge progress towards the achievement of
the success outcomes aligned with the four strategic priorities, RTD partnered with TransPro Consulting
to conduct a Customer Experience and a Community Value Survey which were completed November 16,
2021.
The survey execution for each survey is as follows:

Packet Pg. 3

1.D.1

Customer Experience:
• Customer intercept surveys to engage with individuals using bus and rail services and
• Telephone surveys of existing paratransit service customers
Customer Value:
• Telephone surveys of individuals within RTD’s service area, including those who may not utilize
transit services
Pursuant to the Board of Directors’ request for third-party validation of the baseline data, RTD issued a
purchase order with its financial auditing consulting firm, Plante Moran, in January 2022, to
independently validate the statistical survey data. Plante Moran found no substantive errors in the survey
data.
