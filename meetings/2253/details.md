#### 1. Local Government Update - CRL Associates

Sherry Ellebracht, Government Relations Officer, told the Directors that Roger Sherman from CRL Associates was not in attendance due to an illness.  He sent a written update that Sherry Ellebracht read to the Directors.

The update mentioned CRL Associates attendance at the Full Metro Mayors Caucus Meeting on February 4th and the Colorado City and County Management Association Winter Conference from February 26th-28th.  CRL Associates also met with Committee Chair Folska and Committee Vice-Chair Francone and look forward to working with the Committee’s leadership.

Sherry Ellebracht noted that CRL Associates is monitoring the Denver elections as well as the issues dominating the races.  They have been in contact with all the candidates for the open seats.  CRL Associates have also spent time coordinating with Brandeberry~McKenna keeping the Local Government updated on the Public Private Partnership Bill that was postponed indefinitely by the State Senate.

#### 2. State Legislative Update - Brandeberry~McKenna Public Affairs

Jenifer Brandeberry, from Brandeberry ~ McKenna, informed the Directors that her team met with the Governor’s Office on Friday, February 27th.  During that meeting the Governor’s Office committed to making a proclamation for Stand Up for Transportation Day on April 9th, 2015.  Stand Up for Transportation Day was referenced during the FasTracks Monitoring Committee meeting prior to the Government Relations Committee.  Jenifer Brandeberry said that she appreciated the work of Pauletta Tonilas, Senior Manager for Public Relations and Public Information, and her team.

Jenifer Brandeberry noted that the Legislative Session is halfway through its season.  She said that John Tarbert, Transit Police Chief, is working with the Colorado Association of Chiefs of Police on a late bill to update and clarify the police officer statute as it pertains to RTD.  He requested the Brandeberry ~ McKenna team to assist in securing bi-partisan support.  The bill has not been introduced yet. Jenifer Brandeberry thanked Chief Tarbert for his effort.

Senator Randy Baumgardner, Senate Transportation Committee Chair, requested a tour of DIA’s component of the East Line Project.  On the way to DIA the Senate Transportation Committee members (Hon. Ray Scott, Hon. John Cooke, Hon. Leroy Garcia, and Hon. Nancy Todd) will be updated on the Eagle P3 Project.

The Community College of Denver made a presentation to the Business, Labor, Economic, & Workforce Development Caucus on the WIN program.  This presentation was part of trending topics throughout the legislature.  She commended RTD for their work on the WIN program.

Jenifer Brandeberry mentioned that the Construction Defect Bill is now Senate Bill 177.  It has a late bill status and it is currently in negotiations before being calendared.  One of the addenda being considered is an affordable housing piece.  Brandeberry ~ McKenna will keep the Directors updated.

She noted that the last half of the legislative session will have more activity.  The March revenue forecast comes out in the next couple of weeks.  Jenifer Brandeberry mentioned that with the split legislature chambers it will be interesting to see what if any kind of budget compromises will happen.

Committee Chair Folska asked Jenifer Brandeberry to send all the Directors the invitation to the DIA Tour with the Senate Transportation Committee.  Jenifer Brandeberry said that she will send it to the Directors.  She noted that the tour will happen while the APTA Legislative Conference is in process.

Director Menten asked about the bill the Governor vetoed last year regarding urban renewal and tax increment financing and if there were any efforts in resurrecting it.  Jenifer Brandeberry replied that a new bill, Senate Bill 123, is making an attempt to revive the mentioned bill but it is not sufficient for the proponents of the reform in the urban renewal area.  The Speaker of the House is creating her own bill but it has not been introduced yet.  Director Menten said that it will be interesting to see how Colorado Counties, Inc. (CCI) will react as they probably will not be happy with this outcome.  She requested from Jenifer Brandeberry the contact information for CCI.  Jenifer Brandeberry said she will update the Board when the new bill starts moving.

#### 3. Federal Update - Squire Patton Boggs

Sherry Ellebracht, Government Relations Officer, noted that Mike Dino from Squire Patton Boggs, is in Washington, D.C. preparing for the Directors’ attendance to the APTA Legislative Conference next week. She forwarded his update via email to the Directors.  Sherry Ellebracht mentioned that that morning the House of Representatives did pass a clean immigration bill and the President said that he would sign it.  This will fund Homeland Security through September 30th.

Committee Chair Folska asked Sherry Ellebracht to read the update sent by Mike Dino as it was not included in the packet.  Sherry Ellebracht asked if a summary would suffice.  Committee Chair Folska said that she preferred Sherry Ellebracht read the document.  Sherry Ellebracht read the document.  A copy of the document is available at the Board Office.

### C. Other Matters

Sherry Ellebracht, Government Relations Officer, distributed to the Directors a packet of information for the APTA Legislative Conference occurring the next week.  She noted the work of Squire Patton Boggs in coordinating the Directors’ visit as well as having General Manager Phil Washington participate on a Senate Banking Round Table.

Director Walker said that RTD will host the APTA Transit Board Member and Board Support Seminar in July.  He handed out candy bars with the workshop logo that will be distributed during the APTA Legislative Conference as a marketing piece.  He noted there will be interesting sessions covering subjects such as: career pathways and development, Board role in goal setting, CEO hiring process, etc.  He mentioned there will also be tours of different projects throughout the District.  He pointed out that there will be an old style Colorado Ho Down at Coors Field and a reception at Denver Union Station.  Staff is currently looking for sponsors for those events.  He thanked the Board Office Staff for their hard work.  Committee Chair Folska said that it is great RTD is hosting the Workshop.

Marla Lien, General Counsel, said that the Court ruled in favor of RTD on House bill 131272: sales tax parity bill.  It is up to the plaintiffs to appeal the decision once again.  Director Hoy asked if RTD had implemented the bill already.  Marla Lien replied that it has been implemented and if the court ruled against RTD it would mean that the Agency would have to issue refunds.

### E. Adjourn

Committee Chair Folska adjourned to the Planning and Development Committee at 6:43 p.m.
