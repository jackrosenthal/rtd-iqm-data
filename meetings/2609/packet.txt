BACKGROUND
The purpose of this Board Report is to request an amendment to the 2017 Adopted Budget. This
amendment will account for capital carryforward adjustments from year-end 2016 to 2017. The
amendment also will detail other adjustments to the capital budget and adjustments to the operating and
administrative budget.
DISCUSSION
Overview of the 2017 Budget Amendment

Packet Pg. 13

2.11.A

The total proposed appropriation for the 2017 Amended Budget and the changes from the 2017
Adopted Budget are summarized in the first set of tables above.
2017 Operating Expense Adjustments
The operating and administrative expense portion of the proposed budget amendment reflects an
increase of $35.9 million from the 2017 Adopted Budget. This increase consists of $16.2 million on the
Base System, $19.5 million in FasTracks Project/Construction, and $0.2 million in FasTracks Operations.
Of the $16.2 million increase for the Base System, major elements are $1.8 million for a $1/hour
increase to operator wages plus fringes; $4.7 million to repair coping panels on light rail (offset by thirdparty revenue); $0.620 million for light rail station high block repairs; $1.2 million for additional worker’s
compensation insurance; $1.7 million for a new planning project for East Colfax (offset by grant
revenue); $0.250 million for digital signage at DUS; adjustments to expense project carry-forward; and
various capital to expense budget transfers. On the Base System, the true increase to operating
expenses is less than 1.0%.
For FasTracks Project, the $19.5 million increase consists primarily of $11.5 million in a water-line
betterment related to SERE (offset by third-party revenue); $1.3 million in additional expenses for the
Eagle project, R Line, and SERE project, including insurance claims and pnr improvements; $4.0 million
for North Metro betterment work (offset by third-party revenue); and $2.0 million in legal expenses for
FasTracks projects. For FasTracks Operations, the $0.2 million increase consists of Eagle project thirdparty betterments (offset by third-party revenue) and extension of marketing/events staff due to delayed
project opening.
Shown in detail on the attached Amendment A, major changes in Amended Budget operating expenses
(excluding previously approved transfers and expense project carry-forward) are summarized by
department below.

Debt Service
On the Base System, interest expense is expected to decrease by $2.3 million from the benefit of debt
refunding/refinancing in 2017. Debt principal payments will increase by $1.4 million per adjustments to
amortization schedules. Capitalized interest is expected to show no change. On FasTracks, interest
expense will decrease by $3.1 million due to the benefit of debt refunding/refinancing. Debt principal
payments will decline by $2.2 million per adjustments to amortization schedules. Capitalized interest is
expected to remain the same. No new financing will be issued in 2017 for either Base System or
FasTracks.
2017 New Capital
The new capital portion of the proposed amended budget reflects a net increase of $1.3 million over the
2017 Adopted Budget. These changes result from program changes that have occurred since the 2017
Budget was adopted, and include the following significant changes:
Base System

Packet Pg. 15

2.11.A

New capital changes for Base System result in a net increase of $0.9 million from the Adopted Budget.
Adjustments to new capital funding since the 2017 Adopted Budget include additional funding of $1.5
million via budget transfers for several projects including Downtown Track & Switches Replacement,
Aurora and Sheridan bike shelters, and the Colfax Avenue Transit Priority Project. These amounts are
offset by reductions in spending of $0.6 million for Property Survey Records and Cybersecurity. Please
see Attachment B for detail.
FasTracks
New capital changes to FasTracks result in a net increase of $0.4 million from the Adopted Budget.
This results from updated project schedules for current projects that changed the projected expenditures
in 2017, adjustments for grant funding, changes in cost estimates, and corrections to the Adopted
Budget. Additions to new capital funding since the 2017 Adopted Budget include $0.5 million in
additional expenses for the Gold Line, and $0.9 million in additional expenses for SERE. These amounts
are offset by a reduction in spending of $1.0 million to the Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility. Please
see Attachment B for detail and Program Capital attached.
Previously Approved Capital Carryforward Adjustments
For the 2017 Adopted Budget, year-to-date actual expenditures as of 9/30/16 were used to compute the
estimate of the carryforward. This methodology is used to accommodate the timing of the adoption of
the annual budget. For the 2017 Amended Budget, year-to-date actual expenditures as of 12/31/16
were used to compute the estimate of the carryforward. This takes into account expenditures that were
made in the last quarter of 2016.
Previously approved capital carryforward of $720.5 million is decreased by $143.5 million from the
2017 Adopted Budget to reflect fourth quarter 2016 actual expenditures, transfers to reclassify certain
capital projects as expense projects and vice versa, previously approved transfers, project scope
changes, and completion of projects. The Base System portion is a decrease of $35.8 million and the
FasTracks portion is a decrease of $107.7 million. Please see Attachment C for detail and Program
Capital attached.
Revenue Changes
In the Amended Budget, revenues are projected to decrease $79.7 million on a combined basis from the
2017 Adopted Budget.






Sales and Use Tax revenues are projected to decrease $22.2 million from the 2017 Adopted
Budget based on the CU-Leeds School March forecast. The 2017 Amended Budget incorporates
the baseline forecast of 4.0% over 2016 actual. The 2017 Adopted Budget used the CU-Leeds
September Baseline forecast which called for a 6.7% increase over the then projected 2016 level.
On a combined basis, grant revenues including operating grants, capital grants, capital
maintenance, FASTER grants, STAMPS and CMAQ grants are projected to decline $49.7 million
from amounts in the 2017 Adopted Budget. On the Base System, grant revenue is projected to
increase $2.4 million in capital maintenance, CMAQ funds for a regional BRT study, and various
FASTER grants. For FasTracks, grants are budgeted to decrease $52.0 million in various grants
for the Eagle project, offset by increases in SERE corridor grants and contributed capital.
Contributed capital (not shown in the table above) is projected to increase $110.4 million from
third-party betterments and project contributions.
Farebox revenue is budgeted to decrease $7.9 million on a combined basis from the 2017
Adopted Budget. For the Base System, fare revenue is budgeted $3.3 million lower due to

Packet Pg. 16

2.11.A



revised estimates over 2016 actuals. For FasTracks Operations, fare revenue is budgeted to
decline $4.6 million due to revised estimates and delay in planned new service in 2017. Of
projected fare revenue of $142.5 million, $114.2 million is attributed to the Base system and
$28.3 million is attributed to FasTracks. Fare revenue is adjusted downward in the Amended
Budget on the basis of a fare revenue model which is now being used to estimate and allocate
fare revenue between Base and FasTracks and within FasTracks service corridors, and which
takes into account ridership decline.
Other operating revenue will remain flat from the 2017 Adopted Budget.

Although the primary sources of operating revenue are budgeted to decline, other sources of funding are
anticipated to materialize to support the budgeted increase in operating expense. These include: 1)
reduction to interest expense and principal debt payments totaling $6.2 million, 2) third-party funding,
and 3) increase to the unrestricted fund from the release of $11.0 million in TABOR reserves in
exchange for providing the Mariposa facility as collateral. Regarding the latter, a similar arrangement
was executed in 2016 exchanging the Blake building as collateral for TABOR reserves in order to raise
funding. Capital expenditures (on-going and carry-forward) will be funded by previously issued debt
proceeds and previously identified project funding.

Unrestricted Year-End Fund Balance

The combined Unrestricted Year-End Fund Balance is projected to increase $9.6 million from the
Adopted Budget to $23.9 million reflecting the addition of $11.0 million in TABOR reserves described
above, net of amended budget revisions to both revenue and expenses, replenishment of BoardAppropriated fund, and increases per fund balance policy.
FasTracks Project Reserves
The proposed 2017 Amended Budget reflects maintenance of the FasTracks Management Reserve
(formerly contingency reserve) at a balance of $15.9 million. This reserve is appropriated annually, and
is used to fund any changes in the FasTracks schedule that could not be forecast at the time of adoption
of the annual budget. The purpose of this reserve is to allow the District to accommodate minor
changes to the FasTracks schedule without requiring frequent budget amendments to draw funds from
the FasTracks Construction Reserve. The FasTracks Construction Reserve is budgeted at $56.3 million.
These project reserve balances remain unchanged from the 2017 Adopted Budget.

Budget Transfers
The proposed 2017 Amended Budget reflects year-to-date budget transfers executed within the General
Manager’s authority or by prior authorization of the Board of Directors. The District’s budget transfer
policy was adopted by the Board of Directors on 2/26/85 and further amended on 1/1/93, 5/15/08 and
4/1/10. The policy states that cumulative transfers between projects in amounts exceeding $250,000
require prior approval of the Board of Directors.
Cost Recovery Ratio
The proposed 2017 Amended Budget meets the cost recovery ratio mandated by the Colorado General
Assembly. The estimated SB154 recovery ratio (all nontax revenue except ADA farebox revenues

Packet Pg. 17

2.11.A

divided by all expenditures, including depreciation, except ADA expenditures and expenditures incurred
for long-term planning and development of rapid transit infrastructure) exceeds the annual target of 30%
mandated by the General Assembly. The RTD operating revenue recovery ratio (operating revenues
except ADA farebox revenues divided by the same cost basis as the Colorado General Assembly) is
estimated to exceed the 20% target established by the Board of Directors.

Fund Balance Policy
The proposed 2017 Amended Budget includes a reserve of 3% of annual spending as defined in Article
X, Section 20 of the Colorado Constitution (the TABOR reserve). The proposed 2017 Amended Budget
maintains a Board-Appropriated Fund, Capital Replacement Fund, Unrestricted Year-End Fund, and
Unrestricted Operating Fund (Base System only) in the District's working capital. The objective is for the
total of these funds excluding the Capital Acquisition Fund to equal approximately three months of
operating expenses excluding depreciation for each of the District entities (Base System, FasTracks
Project and FasTracks Operations). On the Base System, this objective is not expected to be met in the
2017 Amended Budget.
Basis of Accounting and Budgeting
The accounts of the District are reported using the accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are
recognized when earned and expenses are recognized when incurred. The District’s basis of budgeting
follows the accrual basis of accounting except (1) capital outlays and payments of debt principal are
treated as expenditures, (2) asset sale proceeds and debt issuance proceeds are included, (3)
depreciation, gains and losses on disposal of property and equipment, and the non-cash portion of longterm unfunded pension accruals are excluded.

ALTERNATIVES
1. Amend the 2017 Adopted Budget to reflect the capital project changes and the adjustments to the
operating budget. This is the recommended action.
2. Request staff to revise the proposed amendments to the 2017 Adopted Budget and amend the
budget with revisions.
3. Do not amend the 2017 Adopted Budget. This is not recommended, because the 2017 Adopted
Budget does not reflect the capital carryforward adjustments, capital budget adjustments, and
material changes to the operating and administrative budget.

Notes:
1

Reconciling items reflect cash activity in capital projects, inventory, accounts receivable and prepaids, accruals and capitalized interest.

2

Reserves include funds that are legally restricted by bond covenants, other contracts, Board designation and policy guidelines.

3

Reserves are an appropriated reserve which is available to fund unforseen projects expenses (such as a contingency reserve).

4

Reserves respresent revenues that are designated to be spent in future years for the construction of the FasTracks capital program.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Nominating Committee for the RTD Citizens Advisory Committee of the
Regional Transportation District (RTD) that the RTD Board of Directors reappoint two members of the
Committee to an additional three-year term, appoint three new members to the Committee to three-year
terms and appoint one new member to the Committee to a one-year term as identified in this Report.
BACKGROUND
The Regional Transportation District (RTD) Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) is made up of residents
from around the region. Members are appointed by RTD Board of Directors and volunteer their time to
advise the District on a range of issues that affect citizens and impact the region.
Five current members’ terms expire on May 31, 2017. Additionally, one member whose term expires
May 31, 2018 has resigned creating an additional vacancy.
Recruitment for citizens interested in serving was publicly advertised through the RTD Web site, local
publications and stakeholder e-mail distributions beginning April 26, 2017. Applicants were asked to
submit a letter stating why they want to serve on the committee and what unique experience and skillsets they bring; describing affiliations and volunteer activities they believe will add value to the
committee; and a statement of personal objectives/goals if accepted for CAC membership.
A total of 23 applications were received by the May 14,2017 deadline. Three current members are
eligible for reappointment and two of the three expressed an interest in continuing to serve on the
Committee.
The Nominating Committee decided, based on attendance, participation at meetings and Committee
consistency to recommend reappointment of the two current members who requested reappointment.
The Nominating Committee then carefully reviewed each application received and conducted interviews
with short-listed applicants to fill four positions, considering criteria outlined in the Committee Structure
adopted by the Board in 2005, including:

Date:

May 31, 2017

Subject:

Approval of 2017-2021 Bridge Inspections
Budget Request

General

Board Meeting Date: June 27, 2017

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to execute a threeyear contract, with two one-year optional extensions, for On-Call Bridge Inspections with Alfred Benesch
& Company, in a dollar amount not to exceed $1,560,900. Funding for the first year of this action is
$205,700 and is included in the 2017 Adopted Budget.
BACKGROUND
RTD owns and is responsible for the inspection of 88 bridges including Light Rail bridges, Pedestrian
bridges and Denver Union Station’s Commuter Rail and Amtrak bridges. RTD is also responsible for the
inspection of 14 Freight Rail bridges on the Southwest Corridor through construction agreements made
with the railroads when the corridor was built. Inspection of Commuter Rail bridges on the Eagle Project
is the responsibility of Denver Transit Operators.
Capital Programs Engineering Division has managed regularly scheduled bridge inspections for Southwest
Corridor Freight Rail bridges since 2002, Pedestrian bridges since 2010, and Light Rail bridges since
2014 (previously managed by Rail Ops since 2005). These bridge inspections were made by a subconsultant to an on-call engineering services prime consultant through 2016.
Bridge inspections are made with the purpose of detecting structure deterioration and damage, for which
repairs and maintenance are then made to correct. These measures help to assure that the bridges are
safe to carry the loads they were designed for through their intended life. The Commuter Rail and
Freight Rail bridges are inspected annually by mandate of the Federal Railroad Administration; Light Rail
bridges are inspected biannually in compliance with American Public Transportation Association
guidelines; RTD’s pedestrian bridges are inspected biannually in accordance with CDOT bridge inspection
policy.
RTD contracts this work to a qualified bridge inspection consultant. Bridge inspectors are required to
have completed National Bridge Inspection Standards training, including an 80-hour primary course and
appropriate supplemental courses. Bridge inspection team leaders are in addition required to be
registered professional engineers. In addition to performing regularly scheduled bridge inspections, the
inspection consultant provides a directory of on-call staff available at all times for emergency
inspections.
Many of the bridges, particularly the pedestrian bridges, require the use of a bucket truck with up to 80foot reach to access portions of the bridge that can’t be viewed otherwise; this in turn requires the use
of traffic control on the highways below. The average annual budget for the bridge inspections,
including inspection staff, access equipment, traffic control, and other costs, is about $312,180.

Packet Pg. 42

2.12.C

DISCUSSION
RTD bridge inspection’s discovery of structure damage that required substantial repairs has occurred at
the LRT over Alameda Avenue bridge, where heavily corroded steel column bases required repair by steel
treatment and concrete encasement to preserve and strengthen the deteriorated columns, and at the
LRT over Belleview Avenue bridge, where excessive and progressive deflection of under-designed
retaining walls at the bridge abutments required repair by installation of ground anchors through the
walls to prevent further displacement and possible failure. Numerous other repairs of less critical
conditions have been initiated by the bridge inspection program, including some which may have
circumvented more costly repairs in the future.
INSPECTION CONSULTANT SELECTION
RTD’s Request for Proposals for the bridge inspections was publicly advertised and resulted in submittals
from three consulting engineering firms that regularly perform bridge inspections for various public
agencies. Technical appraisal of the proposals was made by an evaluation team comprised of RTD
engineering staff using specific evaluation criteria listed in the Request for Proposals. Commitment to
fulfilling the required Small Business Enterprise goal was evaluated by the RTD Small Business Office.
Due to close scores in the proposals evaluation, each of the proposing companies was brought in for
interviews with RTD staff from Engineering, Purchasing, and the Small Business Office. At the end of
the selection process Alfred Benesch & Company was determined as the firm most qualified to fulfill the
requirements of this contract.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The RTD 2017 Adopted Budget includes $205,700 to fund the first year of this contract. Funding for
the following two years of the contract and the two one-year optional extensions was included in the
2017-2022 Strategic Budget Plan. (The average annual budget amount is $312,180; alternating years
vary significantly due mainly to costs of about $110,000 per inspection cycle for access equipment and
traffic control for the biannual pedestrian bridge inspections.)
SBE GOAL
The SBE Goal for this project was established by the RTD Small Business Office as 5% of the contracted
work cost. The bridge inspection consultant has stated in their proposal for this contract that the SBE
Goal will be met through the use of technical services subcontractors for portions of the work.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the recommended action. It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs &
FasTracks Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee,
to execute all documents necessary to execute the three-year contract, with two one-year
optional extensions, for On-Call Bridge Inspections in a dollar amount not to exceed $1,560,900.
Funding for the first year of this action is $205,700 and is included in the 2017 Adopted Budget
2. Do not accept the recommended action. Discontinue RTD bridge inspections in disregard of
federal regulations and other agencies’ policies; do not monitor bridge conditions, and do not
provide maintenance and repairs, as need for this work would not be known.

3. Perform bridge inspections using RTD staff. This is not recommended as it: 1) Would require
additional staff to supplement current structural engineering staff; 2) Would require over 100
hours standard bridge inspection training, which is not readily available and typically not available
locally, for each inspector; 3) Would substantially interfere with day-to-day engineering work,
especially during pedestrian bridge inspections to efficiently use rented access equipment; 4)
Would subject RTD to risk and liability in working over state and interstate highways; 5) Would
generally be significantly less efficient for RTD than contracting a specialized and experienced
bridge inspection consultant

Contract Award to Parsons Transportation
Group for the SH 119 Bus Rapid Transit
Corridor

Assistant

General

Board Meeting Date: June 27, 2017

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager to approve a professional services contract award to
Parsons Transportation Group to serve as the Contractor for assistance in the preparation of National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review and Preliminary Engineering (PE) services for the SH 119
Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) corridor for an amount not to exceed $3,250,000. Funding for this contract
is included in the 2017 Adopted Budget for the SH 119 BRT project.
BACKGROUND
RTD initiated the Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS), in April 2013. The purpose of the study
was to develop consensus among RTD, the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) and the
Northwest-area stakeholders, including local jurisdictions and businesses, on cost effective and
efficient mobility improvements to serve the Northwest area. On June 24, 2014, the Board approved
a resolution which accepted the Final Consensus Statement as developed by the NAMS stakeholders
for priorities within the Northwest Study Area. One of the highest priorities, as described in the Final
Consensus Statement, was to proceed into advanced planning, environmental clearance and
preliminary engineering to establish Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) in the SH 119 Corridor from Longmont
to Boulder.
As part of the 2040 Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) process, the Denver Regional Council of
Governments (DRCOG) included the SH 119 BRT Corridor in the Fiscally Constrained 2040 RTP.
Inclusion of the corridor in the RTP is required before NEPA review can be completed. In order to
advance this effort, DRCOG awarded RTD $1 million in Transportation Improvement Program (TIP)
grant funds to help fund this study. The DRCOG TIP funds must be obligated by September 2017 or
they potentially could be rescinded.
The cost to establish BRT in the corridor is estimated to be approximately $57 million in 2013
dollars. Staff assumes that grants will provide funding for approximately half of this cost. The
Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) includes $60 million in Base System funds (with $30 million assumed to
be from grant sources) for construction of the corridor beginning in 2022.
DISCUSSION
RTD issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) in February 2017 for consultant services to assist with the
preparation of NEPA review and Preliminary Engineering (PE) services for the SH 119 BRT Corridor.
The RFP included a 22 percent Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) goal. A committee
comprised of representatives from RTD, CDOT and DRCOG staffs along with three representatives
from the respective local jurisdictions (City of Longmont, City of Boulder and Boulder County)
reviewed proposals submitted by consultant teams in a qualifications-based selection process. The
evaluation considered each team’s technical proposal in the areas of Key Personnel Qualifications,

Packet Pg. 45

2.12.D

Project Understanding and Approach, Team Qualifications, DBE Commitment, Schedule, and
Innovation. The five proposing teams were led by the following companies: CH2M Hill, David Evans,
HDR, Michael Baker, and Parsons Transportation Group.
The selection committee short-listed three teams for interviews and is now recommending that a
team led by Parsons Transportation Group be approved by the Board. The committee found that the
Parsons team had the most extensive BRT planning, environmental, design and implementation
experience. Staff is requesting that the Board approve this recommendation and authorize the
General Manager to negotiate a contract not to exceed $3,250,000. Upon successful negotiations,
the study will begin immediately and is expected to be completed by the end of 2019. As noted
above, the RFP established a 22 percent DBE goal. Parsons has committed to exceeding this with a
DBE commitment of almost 30 percent.
The final product of the study will be to provide RTD with the necessary NEPA review and sufficient
engineering design to render the corridor eligible for grant funding for construction. Specifically, the
Contractor/Consultant will assist RTD with providing NEPA evaluation for the corridor as well as PE
work.
Should RTD pursue BRT construction in this corridor after completion of the NEPA and PE work, the
SH 119 BRT project would be subject to future approval by the RTD Board. In addition, RTD might
be required to seek DRCOG SB 208 approval as this project may be defined as a fixed guideway
corridor project. The expectation is that the funding breakdown for future BRT construction in the
corridor would be as follows:



50 percent from RTD Base System Funds; and
50 percent from grant sources, such as DRCOG Transportation Improvement Program (TIP)
funds, and/or Federal Transit Administration (FTA) Small Starts funding.

Project construction could occur within the 2022 to 2025 timeframe. And, as noted, future Board
action would be required to approve construction of BRT in this corridor.
The proposed action fits within the General Manager Goal to Improve Service Delivery, specifically
the sub goal of enhancing or expanding operations, as the eventual completion of BRT in the SH 119
corridor will increase service reliability, ridership and cost effectiveness of the service.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for this study was provided through a transfer of $3.5 million from the Planning expense
grant project budget to a new capital project for the SH 119 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Corridor
through Board action on October, 25 2016. This transfer moved $1.5 million in funding that was
previously approved in the 2016 Amended Budget and advanced additional funding that had been
approved in the 2017-2022 SBP for 2017 and 2018. As noted, $1 million of this funding is being
provided by a DRCOG grant.

Southwest Chief and Front Range Passenger
Rail Commission Appointee

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager to appoint William C. Van Meter as the Regional Transportation District
Commissioner to the Southwest Chief and Front Range Passenger Rail Commission, created by the
Colorado General Assembly during the 2017 session.
BACKGROUND
During the Seventy First General Assembly, Senate Bill 17-153, Concerning establishment of the
Southwest Chief and Front Range Passenger Rail Commission to oversee the preservation and expansion
of Amtrak Southwest Chief Rail Service in Colorado and facilitate the development and operation of a
Front Range Passenger Rail System that provides passenger rail service in and along the Interstate 25
Corridor, was passed and signed by the Governor into law. This commission is created in the Colorado
Department of Transportation and consists of eleven commissioners, as listed below.
Five commissioners appointed by the Governor as follows:




Two public rail transportation advocates;
Two representatives of Class I freight railroads that serve Colorado;
One resident of Huerfano, Las Animas, Otero, Prowers, or Pueblo County who has publicly
advocated for public rail;

One Commissioner from each of the following Metropolitan Planning Organizations and Regional Planning
Commissions:






The North Front Range Metropolitan Planning Organization;
The Denver Regional Council of Governments;
The Pikes Peak Area Council of Governments;
The Pueblo Area Council of Governments;
The South Central Council of Governments; and

One Commissioner who is a representative of the Regional Transportation District.
In addition to the eleven commissioners, the Commission includes the following two appointed advisors,
who shall attend Commission meetings and advise the Commission but are not voting members of the
Commission:



An employee of the Department of Transportation;
An employee of Amtrak.

The Commission’s duties include the coordination of efforts to ensure that track repairs and upgrades
required for the continuation of existing Southwest Chief Rail service in Colorado are completed,
extending rail service to Pueblo, and exploring the benefits of extending service to Walsenburg. The
Commission is also tasked with developing draft legislation that facilitates the development of a

2.12.E

passenger rail system that provides service in and along the I-25 corridor. The Commission must present
the draft legislation to the Local Government committees of the General Assembly no later than
December 1, 2017.
DISCUSSION
RTD has been advised that the RTD commissioner should be someone intrinsically involved in transit
planning in order to properly advise the Commission on how a Front Range Passenger Rail System will
interface with the RTD light and commuter rail systems. This Committee recommends William C. Van
Meter, Assistant General Manager of Planning to be the RTD commissioner on this commission.
Mr. Van Meter has been in a transportation planner at RTD since 1991 and was appointed to his current
position of Assistant General Manager, Planning in 2008. He holds Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in
Economic Geography from the University of Illinois and has over 28 years of experience in the
transportation planning field. He has extensive experience in public transit planning, leading multi-modal
transportation studies, and managing RTD’s New Starts and Small Starts grant funding processes with
the Federal Transit Administration. He has participated in various capacities in the planning for all of
RTD’s rail corridors. Mr. Van Meter currently serves on the Colorado Department of Transportation’s
Transit & Rail Advisory Committee and he is a non-voting member of the Denver Regional Council of
Governments Board of Directors.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Commissioners serve without compensation but receive reimbursement for expenses. RTD estimates
little fiscal impact to the budget except for the time involved in working with the Commission.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs &
FasTracks Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to appoint
William C. Van Meter as the Regional Transportation District Commissioner to the Southwest
Chief and Front Range Passenger Rail Commission, created by the Colorado General Assembly
during the 2017 session.
2.

Do not accept the Recommended Action. This option is not recommended because William C.
Van Meter is a well-qualified and knowledgeable individual who has been intrinsically involved
in planning all RTD rail projects.

contract authority for Infax, Inc.

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: June 14, 2017
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: June 27, 2017

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorizes the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to increase
the contract authority amount with Infax, Inc. (Contract Number 15FH003) from the current level of
$1,788,655.39 by $825,000.00 to new total contract amount of $2,613,655.39.
BACKGROUND
RTD uses Programmable Information Displays (PIDs) including monitors and light-emitting diode (LED)
signs, to provide riders information on travel status. RTD’s current system uses monitors at a number
of venues including Denver Union Station, Civic Center Station, Boulder Station, Boulder Junction at
Depot Square and the Denver International Airport (DIA). There are also LED signs throughout the
region and on most light rail platforms.
The displays provide scheduled departure information for RTD fixed route service and light rail. With
the advancement of Real-Time Passenger information, the new data will be extended into the PID’s
system.
The current system was deployed well over six-years ago and has functioned well with reasonable
reliability, however it is currently outdated with replacement parts becoming non-existent to obtain.
With the FasTrack expansion, a desire for additional functionality (e.g. real-time information) and the
importance of the customer service, a procurement was released in 2015 to extend, enhance and/or
replace in-kind, the system. The new equipment will also retain RTD compliance with the accessibility
requirements for all RTD customers.
DISCUSSION
RTD released a Request for Proposal (RFP) No. 15FH003, on May 20, 2015 to provide for a full range
of services and products related to RTD’s Programmable Information Display System (PIDs). The
contract has a 6% DBE participation requirement. A well-attended vendor briefing was held June 2,
2015. The proposal period closed June 26, 2015, two proposals were received and Infax was
subsequently selected and contracted.
The contract was structured with a series of options that supported operations and future needs. The
original contract authority was for $1,788,655.39, the first set of assignments are complete and
addressed: additional signage at DUS, full implementation at Boulder Junction at Depot Square, Oak

Packet Pg. 50

2.12.F

Street Station, and US 36. These projects were primarily funded by a federal grant.
Subsequently there have been additional sign projects needed including replacement of the PIDs at the
new Civic Center Station (CCS) and additional hardware and software to fully upgrade 48 Light
Rail platforms and back office servers and workstations. This additional contract authority will allow
these projects to proceed. This also provides for the maintenance and support for the ongoing
operations of the new equipment.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
This contract authority increase is to provide for planned projects including, integration of real-time
information, and replacement of current light rail platform signage and hardware. Funding is through
existing grants, SBP and operational accounts.
ALTERNATIVES


Authorize the General Manager or his designee to increase the Infax contract not-to-exceed
amount by $825,000 to a new contract amount not to exceed $2,613,655.39. This is the
recommended action



Continue to provide remedial repairs to extend the system life. This is not a sustainable
option.
Proceed with an entirely new procurement. This would take well over a year to procure and
deploy the chosen system.

Approval to enter into a contract with Mosaic
451 for Manager Security Services

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: June 14, 2017
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: June 27, 2017

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to enter into contract negotiations with Mosaic451,
LLC, a Managed Security Services Provider (MSSP) to support of RTD’s Information Technology (IT)
systems security. The estimated cost of the Managed Security Services contract of $1,901,235.00
includes round-the-clock support for RTD’s boundary firewalls, security monitoring for RTD’s most
critical systems, and analysis of and response to security incidents for a period of five years. Funding
for this project is included in the Cybersecurity Services budget for 2017 forward and was approved
during the 2016 Strategic Budget Process.
BACKGROUND
Cybersecurity is a necessary part – and one of IT’s key contributions – to RTD’s safety mission.
Detecting threats before they become damaging to RTD or RTD’s customers is a key part of the
cybersecurity mission and one of the five primary elements of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.
Robust, mature services that provide real-time threat data, like 24x7 system monitoring, require staff
dedicated to the monitoring and response processes supported by log analysis technologies. RTD’s
current monitoring strategies are reactive, patchy (only apply to certain systems), and driven only by
significant events, leaving RTD vulnerable to most cyberattacks which are designed to escape
immediate attention and impacting RTD’s ability to comply with regulatory requirements such as the
Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS). With competing demands for growth, RTD
IT has neither the cybersecurity staff nor the technologies on board to support this important process
internally.
In addition to the above, the number and complexity of boundary firewalls protecting the District
from outside attack grew significantly in 2016. Historically, less than half of one staff member’s time
has been dedicated to monitoring, maintaining, and managing one firewall, which moderated RTD’s
primary connection to the Internet. When three additional, advanced firewalls were added in 2016, it
soon became clear that a partial staff member is not nearly enough staff time to perform the
necessary cleanup, maintenance, and configuration, nor for the staff member to maintain focus or
develop the experience required for RTD to benefit from the security features included in the new
firewalls.
There are significant advantages to RTD in choosing Mosaic451 to provide Managed Security
Services, including:
 Immediate visibility to, analysis of, and if needed, response to security events impacting
RTD’s monitored systems and networks, 24x7, every day of the year;
 Alleviates staff bottleneck within IT department regarding firewall support, and instead moves
RTD to a 24x7 support model, allowing us to use technology experts to streamline the device

Packet Pg. 52

2.12.G

configuration, resolve critical connectivity issues and make adjustments to respond to security
events in a timely manner, day or night;
 Satisfies Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) requirements (Section 10)
for system monitoring and analysis;
 Direct personal contact with the provider’s Security Operations Center through a dedicated
onsite support contact that acts as a member of the RTD cybersecurity team;
 Allows RTD’s internal resources to focus on the direction, development, and implementation
of RTD’s enterprise-wide cybersecurity program, policies, and procedure- and system-level
improvements, vs. constantly reacting to incidents;
 RTD owns and retains all of the source data and systems used to gather data for monitoring
on premises, so that it is available in the event RTD needs or wants to discontinue services or
switch service providers;
 Significant cost savings over building our own internal Security Operations Center (i.e.
establishing workspace, hiring additional staff, and implementing monitoring technologies)
 Shorter time to develop and deliver the necessary monitoring and support capabilities by using
trained resources that operate to standard procedures.
Mosaic451 will help RTD to more quickly and effectively detect, contain, and eradicate threats to
RTD’s service availability, financial security, and passenger and staff safety using a constantly
available staff of trained security professionals. Mosaic451 will work side-by-side with RTD’s
cybersecurity team to ensure their efforts align with RTD’s agency-wide, IT, and cybersecurity
objectives and bring tangible value to RTD.
DISCUSSION
The intent of the Managed Security Services contract is to accelerate RTD’s development of
proactive security monitoring and incident response capabilities in order to support RTD’s
cybersecurity and regulatory compliance posture. Acquiring a service provider lets RTD take
advantage of specialized, always available, external expertise with significant savings to the agency
in cost and time.
Following RTD’s Procurement process, the Information Technology department issued a Request for
Proposal to identify a qualified MSSP. A selection committee evaluated and identified the best
candidate, Mosaic451, to meet RTD’s needs. The proposed partnership would allow RTD to retain
Mosaic451 for an initial period of two (2) years with an option to extend services for three (3)
individual years, for a total potential contract period of five (5) years. Additionally, Mosaic451 has
offered that should RTD not be happy with the services provided within the first six (6) months of
the contract, RTD may terminate the contract without further obligation.
The requested funds include:
 Services initiation;
 24x7 support for four (4) advanced boundary firewalls and two (2) web application
firewalls/load balancers;
 24x7 monitoring and incident response support for 40 endpoint devices (ex. servers),
expandable (by option, if exercised) up to 100 critical devices;
 An onsite member of the Security Operations Center to collaborate with RTD on daily
projects, incidents, and reporting.
RTD’s cybersecurity team will collaborate with Mosaic451 to define the systems, business rules for
monitoring, and response procedures that work best for RTD. The initial proposed monitoring scope
includes the managed firewalls and the payment card processing environment.

2.12.G

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The total estimated cost of the Managed Security Services Contract, with options, is $1,901,235.00.
This amount bridges the five (5) year potential contract period. The base cost of $770,715.00 includes
an annually recurring service cost of $376,840.00 for two consecutive years plus $17,035.00 in onetime start-up charges within the first year (2017). All base expenses (for 2017 and 2018) were
budgeted and approved for this purpose via the 2016 and 2017 Strategic Budget Planning process.
Optional future years’ operating expenses were entered into the Strategic Budget Plan for 2018 forward
as projected costs and will be updated as appropriate.
Any additional funding necessary to implement hardware or software improvements required to facilitate
the services are separately budgeted in the appropriate category (capital or expense) for 2017 forward.
ALTERNATIVES
The available alternatives include:
 Approve the contract with Mosaic451. This is the recommended action to accelerate RTD’s
ability to perform proactive monitoring and incident response and meet compliance and
security objectives.
 Establish an internal Security Operations Center. At least four (4) immediate full-time
employees; a 24x7 workspace with enhanced systems visibility (ex. large displays);
acquisition of security log monitoring software; implementation, testing, tuning, and training
on the monitoring software; and the rapid growth of monitoring procedures and expertise will
be required to provide internal services equivalent to that which is offered by Mosaic451.
While it may be possible to hire staff and collaborate with RTD departments and our security
engineering contractors to develop such capabilities over time, this is not the recommended
action because it will take significantly longer to establish, is a significant cost investment,
and should we choose to change course and outsource the service later, may result in sunk
costs.
 Do not approve the contract with Mosaic451 and do not increase cybersecurity staffing (do
nothing). This is not the recommended action because the onboard staff is already
overburdened by the firewall management work and does not currently have the human
capacity to establish and perform the monitoring services.

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

Date: June 13, 2017

From:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

June 13, 2017

Board Meeting Date: June 20, 2017

Subject:

August 2017 Service Changes

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the August 2017 Service Change package as revised and summarized in Attachment A resulting
in an annualized cost savings of approximately $19,700 and, further, to authorize the General Manager
or his designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is
impacted by these changes.
DISCUSSION
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. We will continue adjusting services in
response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. It is also
our responsibility to identify services that are underperforming and recommend modifications,
curtailment or cancellation of service as warranted. The proposals herein include a mix of service
improvements, adjustments and reductions. Bus stop consolidation efforts aimed at optimizing bus stop
spacing, thereby improving operational speed and reliability are proposed for Routes 40, 105 and
services along the Broadway/Lincoln Corridor. Based upon current and past ridership performance a
number of services will have minor service reductions. The Route 46 - South Dahlia will see the largest
reduction in early morning and late evening periods. We will monitor customer response to the
implementation of these service changes and propose adjustments and service alternatives as
appropriate in future service change recommendations.
The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
 Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
 Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
SUMMARY OF PUBLIC HEARINGS
Five public hearings were conducted in Boulder, Curtis Park, Downtown Denver, Littleton and Southeast
Denver, between June 7th and June 13th. Comments and further details from these meetings and the
service change website are summarized in Attachment B of this report.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The overall financial impact contained in this proposal includes an annualized net increase of $80,300 of
which $100,000 would be offset by funding from the City of Golden; for the Golden Call-n-Ride
proposal, resulting in a RTD base system cost savings of approximately $19,700 annualized.
EQUITY ANALYSIS
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and
Executive Order 12898 regarding Environmental Justice. In this circular, the FTA requires RTD to
evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that exceed the established major service
change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a disproportionately negative impact on
minority or low-income populations. Our evaluation of the proposed August 2017 service changes does
not reveal any disparities in impacts absorbed by minority or low-income populations.

August 2017 Service Changes

Bus Service

Route 3L – East Alameda Limited
Delete existing westbound-only stop at Alameda/Xenia (no boardings), and add east- and
westbound stops at 8500 East Alameda, better serving multifamily developments.
Replace existing exception stops at Alameda/Leetsdale and Alameda/Forest with one
exception stop at Alameda/Dahlia. Ridership at Leetsdale and at Forest is very low, less
than 5 passengers/day, while Dahlia serves more development and has a safer pedestrian
crossing at a signalized intersection. No cost impacts are anticipated.
Route 11 - Mississippi Avenue
It is proposed that the westbound trip currently serving Mosier & Raritan at 7:48pm will no
longer serve the Mosier & Raritan loop. New service will be provided on Route 14 at
7:31pm. No cost impacts are anticipated.
Route 14 - West Florida Avenue
Based increased ridership on the Route 14, it is proposed to add two additional westbound
weekday evening trips departing I-25 & Broadway Station at 6:54pm and 7:24pm. It is
proposed to add an additional eastbound weekday evening trip departing Lakewood
Commons at 6:07pm. It also is proposed to add an additional eastbound Saturday morning
trip departing Lakewood Commons at 5:37am. It is proposed to add an additional
westbound Saturday evening trip departing I-25 & Broadway Station at 7:22pm.
It is proposed to add an additional eastbound Sunday morning trip departing Lakewood
Commons at 8:05am. It is proposed to add an additional westbound Sunday morning trip
departing I-25 & Broadway Station at 9:00am. Cost impacts are estimated to be $43,500
annualized.
Route 34 – Bruce Randolph Avenue
In an effort to create a more consistent schedule service to 30th & Downing Station will
be adjusted to operate every 30 minutes during peak periods, for proper connections with
D-Line service. Cost savings are estimated to be $97,400
Route 35 – Hampden
A 2:52pm eastbound trip is proposed, thus starting PM peak 30 minute frequency one
hour earlier. This change would better serve student ridership, notably from Thomas
Jefferson High School. Discontinuance of the 8:52am eastbound trip, which averages 7
passengers or 10.8 passengers per hour is also proposed. The cost impact is expected to
be neutral.

Packet Pg. 59

Attachment: Atch A August 2017 Service Changes (3168 : August 2017 Service Change)

Route 3 – Alameda Avenue
Reschedule eastbound PM peak trips to Aurora Metro Center, to depart Alameda Station
every 30 minutes at 4:59, 5:29, 5:59, and 6:29pm. This would provide a consistent 30
minute frequency at minimal cost, by utilizing current excess recovery on trips terminating
at Alameda Station. Anticipated cost impact is estimated to be $19,500 annualized.

cost are estimated to be $78,000 annualized.
Route 205/205T – 28th Street/ Gunbarrel/Heatherwood
Running time adjustments, weekday; terminal relocation and trip time adjustments at
Heatherwood. No cost impacts are anticipated.
Route 206/206F – Pearl/Manhattan/Fairview High School
Mid-day, reduce frequency from half hourly to hourly south of 55th/Arapahoe due to
extremely low ridership. Maintain AM and PM half-hourly service on current full route, as
well as AM and PM school trippers. Trip time and minor service span adjustments. Cost
savings estimated to be $78,000 annualized
Route 209/209G – CU/Table Mesa Station
Discontinue routing south of Baseline/Mohawk due to extremely low ridership; discontinue
‘Golden West loop’ due to no ridership; residents at Golden West Senior Center have
access to their own shuttle, as well as Access-a-Ride. Cost savings are expected to be an
estimated $78,000 annualized.
Route 236 – Boulder Junction/ Table Mesa Station
Responding to requests from the Boulder City, Boulder County and University of Colorado
Boulder this proposal creates a new local route between Boulder Junction at Depot Square
Station and US36 & Table Mesa Station, mid-day, weekday only, at half-hourly frequency.
This routing is in response to mid-day demand between Boulder Junction and US36 &
Table Mesa Station, as well as along the 28th Street corridor; it will result in connections

to/from CU Main and East Campuses to the already existing transit centers. Anticipated
cost impacts are estimated to be $156,000.

Route DASH/JUMP
This proposal would break the interlining (sharing of vehicles between separate route
services) on Saturday for on-time performance improvements. The current interlining
practices are providing insufficient recovery time for operations on Saturday. Anticipated
cost impact are estimated to be $47,700 annualized.
Free MetroRide
Minor schedule adjustments are proposed to address capacity issues in Union Station.
No cost impacts are anticipated.
Route L/LX/LNX/LSX – Longmont/Denver
It is proposed to rename the Longmont/Denver services with the two letter and numbering
designations, to provide clear distinction between the current Route L bus service and the
potential light rail L Line service. The new name for the services are proposed as follows:
L= LD 1
LX= LD 2
LNX= LX 1
LSX= LX 2
The renaming would be consistent with current naming conventions of Regional and BRT
services. No cost impacts are anticipated with this change.
Route SKIP – Broadway
Running time adjustments for better on-time performance and address some capacity
issues at CU start/end times
Broadway/Lincoln Bus Stops – Transit Accelerator Project
In order to improve travel times, reliability, and on-time performance it is proposed to
consolidate stops on Broadway and Lincoln Street for Routes 0 and 0L, optimized at about
¼ mile spacing. Stops will be removed on Broadway at 14th Ave (when Civic Center
Station is reopened), 7th Ave, Ellsworth Ave, Cedar Ave, and Ohio Ave. A new stop
would be added at Virginia Avenue. Stops will be removed on Lincoln Street at Walsh Pl,
Center Ave, Cedar Ave, and Ellsworth Ave. This will be in conjunction with the City &
County of Denver as part of the NACTO Transit Accelerator Project. The City & County of
Denver will be converting the bus lane on Broadway and on Lincoln Street north of Speer
Blvd to 24-hour operation.
Broadway/Lincoln Limiteds - Routes 0L, 3L, 83L/D, 87L, 100L
It is proposed to standardize the limited stops on Broadway and Lincoln Street between
Colfax Ave and I-25 & Broadway Station to be common among all routes. Southbound
Limited Stops will be along Broadway at 13th Ave, 9th Ave, 1st Ave, Alameda Ave, and

August 2017 Service Changes

Golden Call-n-Ride
Recommendation to add an additional bus to the Golden Flex route service for
approximately 9 hours on weekdays. Currently, the Flex operates every 30 minutes from
the Jefferson County Government Center Golden Station. Adding an additional bus will
increase service to every 15 minutes. The City of Golden will cover all additional costs
associated with an additional bus. This recommendation is subject to approval of a final
contract between the City of Golden and the RTD. Costs: Annual cost will be $100,000
covered by the City of Golden. No cost to the RTD.
Longmont Call-n-Ride
As part of effort to reduce trip denials due to increased demand, which has been increasing
over the past year; this proposal recommends adjusting weekday hours on vehicles already
in operation in the Longmont Call-n-Ride. The first adjustment would have 2 buses in service
during the lunch hour rather than one bus. The second adjustment would keep a peak hour
bus in service for the entire year rather than just the school year. Annualized costs are
estimated to be $72,900, including fuel.
Orchard Call-n-Ride
It is recommended that the boundary of this Call-n-Ride be adjusted enabling more efficient
operation of the service. Recommendations: 1. Adjust northern boundary from Progress
Place to Belleview Avenue for customers staying at an extended stay hotel just north of
Progress Avenue. 2. Adjust southern boundary to serve north side of Arapahoe Road only.
Currently, Call-n-Ride serves addresses on south side of Arapahoe Road. Crossing Arapahoe
Road has been difficult due to traffic congestion. 3. Discontinue the area west of Monaco,
east of Holly and north of Orchard due to low ridership. 4. Restrict the Call-n-Ride from
serving the area around Fiddler’s Green Amphitheatre on event days due to traffic
congestion. No costs are associated with this change.

Rail Service
C, D, and L Line proposal
This proposal has been deferred in an effort to further discussions of alternatives with the
riding public and community stakeholders. This will also allow for the completion of traffic
signal construction and PUC approval of operations along the 14th Street Loop
E Line
This proposal is deferred in concert with the changes proposed with the C, D, and L Line proposal.
Rail lines proposed for routine schedule adjustments:
Minor running time adjustments are proposed for the University of Colorado A Line, B Line
and the R Line on all service days. The same service levels will be provided. No changes
in hours are anticipated.

Public Meeting Comments

Wednesday, June 7, 2017
Calvary Baptist Church
6:00 PM
Staff members in attendance were Jeff Dunning, Jessie Carter, and Dan Merritt. Board
member in attendance was Doug Tisdale. There were 3 members of the public.
The discussions revolved around the impact of bus stop consolidation on the routes 0/0L
and the persistent interest in adding service to the Amazon facilities in the Majestic Park in
Aurora, potentially through a deviation to the route 42.
The concern with the bus stop consolidation is that in removing the stop on Broadway at
Center, there will no longer be a safe and convenient way for residents of the West Wash
Park community to easily get downtown. Community member Charlie Bush did not feel
that adding a limited stop at Exposition was adequate due to the lack of a traffic signal to
allow pedestrians to safely cross both Broadway and Lincoln to access their neighborhood.
The interest in adding service to the Amazon facility in Majestic Park was first brought to
the attention of the Service Planning and Scheduling department in December of 2016,
when Tom Tobiassen facilitated a conversation with Erin Cooper, a member of Amazon’s
HR department. Although there have been multiple discussions with Erin, there has not
been a mutually beneficial solution presented at this time. Sterling Copeland, an employee
of Amazon, was in attendance to champion the cause, and stated that he currently meets
approximately ten other employees at Iliff Station, from where they take Uber or Lyft
together due to the lack of bus service. RTD has chosen to not provide service at this time
to this location due to extreme variance in shift design at Amazon, which prevents a set
peak time from existing. To properly fulfill the facility’s needs, RTD would need to provide
18-20 hours of service to the facility per day. After considerable deliberation, every
alternate routing for the 42 that provided coverage to the Majestic Park presented by the
service planners would require adding an additional all-day bus to the route.

Noon
Staff in attendance included Jessie Carter, Diane Marquiss, Doug Monroe, Cooper Langdon,
Jeff Dunning, Jeff Becker, Cesar Ochoa, Dave Menter, and Tegan Rice. There were 9
members of the public in attendance including RTD Board Member Jeff Walker.
Berda Steen came to discuss the difficulties she has been having with the RTD smart card.
She has used it a couple of times and the system never seems to recognize the 3hr
transfer window she should have. When she tries to board another bus, the system
displays that she has no money on the card and drivers are trying to get her to pay. She
ended up buying passes this month and will try to use her card next month.

2.12.H.b

Krista Wilson lives in west Wash Park and does not want the OL Center stop to be closed.
She rides the bus out of choice, not out of necessity, and will start to drive if the Center
stop is closed for the stop consolidation program. She does not feel safe on the regular
Rte 0, so she does not consider that an option.
Kevin Mooney wanted to discuss the software RTD is using for its trip planner. The old
system would show him, not only the RTD routes, but also routes operated by other
agencies. He would like our system to start displaying all routes by all agencies. He also
asked about public restrooms at our park-n-ride facilities as he is in a wheelchair and needs
a secure area to use the restroom and not risk getting his wheelchair stolen. Jessie told
him we normally do not provide public restrooms at our park-n-rides. Finally, he wanted
additional details regarding the new rte 236. He was directed to talk with Tegan Rice or
Diane Marquiss to get the needed details.
Karen Young asked about what FMR adjustments are being made for the upcoming Aug
17 runboard. Doug explained that the adjustments are minor and will not have a major
impact on the public.
Brad Chamberlin is a West Wash Park neighbor that is upset we are proposing to remove
the 0L stop at Center. He thinks RTD is leaving the Wash Park neighborhood without
adequate bus service and said it started when the rte 12 was changed and no longer
deviated downtown and closing the Center stop on the rte 0L will only reduce the good
transit options for his neighborhood. He said the regular rte 0 is too busy and not reliable
enough to be considered a good alternative to the 0L.
Teresa Ferguson lives in the west Wash Park neighborhood and works for Denver Public
Utilities Company. She likes taking the 0L and will not consider taking the regular rte 0
instead. She has timed how long stopping at Center takes and says in is only 25 seconds,
not significant enough to eliminate the stop. She also doesn’t think it is safe to walk on
Lincoln or Alameda to get to the next nearest 0L stop. If we close the stop at Center, she
will drive and no longer consider taking RTD for her commute. Finally, she thinks closing
the Center stop is unfair to seniors in her neighborhood.
Brad Chamberlin doesn’t agree with our stop spacing standards and thinks we should
consider the bigger picture on how closing Center will impact his neighborhood.
Robert Rynerson – He agrees with our stop consolidation program with one exception. He
said, instead of our stop on 4th Ave we should instead move the stop to 3rd Ave. He said
the stop on 4th isn’t really designed for a bus stop but 3rd Ave was specifically designed to
accommodate a bus stop. We told him that change is in our long-term plans.
J M Fay is a non-verbal ADA passenger that has a lengthy typed statement. I contacted
her after the meeting and she is going to email myself or Jeff Dunning with her statement
so it can be added to the public comments. As of yet, I have not received her statement.

6:00 PM
Staff in attendance included Jessie Carter, Brian Matthews, Doug Monroe, David Menter
and Diane Marquis. There were11 members of the public in attendance including RTD Board
Member Jeff Walker.
Connie Shilvock asked why the C/D-Line changes were proposed along with the L-Line.
Answered by Jessie that it was related to the single track configuration along Welton and
that the changes would allow more D-Line trains to shift to C-Line and DUS.
Commented that RTD needed to be better as an agency. Asked how she could influence
RTD to get that point across. Jessie replied that commenting at this meeting was a good
place to do so, and also noted there were other board meetings where she could also
communicate.
Commented that routes should not be curtailed when they are underperforming, as this
served to ensure the route would perform worse. Commented that Rte #28 does not
always have many riders on it when she rides. She wanted RTD to try harder to increase
ridership on lower performing routes, such as the 28, not curtail such routes. Jessie
responded about RTD service standards and other RTD route performance metrics/factors
that it follows to ensure value for all taxpayers.
Commented that RTD has not expanded ridership over the last several years. Answered
by Jessie that over the last 5-10 years RTD ridership has increased significantly, and gone
over 100,000,000 annual riders now. However, the current year is down slightly, vs. last
year similar to other agencies at this time across the country.
Charlie Bush commented that she rides the 0L route regularly and rides from the bus stop
at Lincoln/Center. She likes transit, especially the value of the 0L route. She said the bus
stop at Center should not be removed from route 0L. This particular bus stop serves
residents of Washington Park well and is well used. Commented that if Center were
closed, the next nearest 0L bus stop would be at Alameda, which is not a convenient or
safe walk along busy street arterials. Commented that the 0 bus, which would continue
to serve the nearby stop at Exposition, was not the same level of service as the 0L since
the 0 operates longer distances and can have wider variations in arrive times. The 0 can
be full and it takes several minutes longer to get downtown on the 0. Stated that she has
ridden the 0 occasionally and has observed puke and pee on the seats of the 0 bus.
Commented that removing the 0L bus stop at Center does not affect the running time that
much. Strongly reiterated that the 0L bus stop at Center should remain.
Commented that other riders often parked, sometimes for many days at a time, along the
street in front of her house near Center/Lincoln, to catch the 0L and 0. This long-term
parking by other out of neighborhood riders was a burden for her neighborhood. This
burden would be further compounded if RTD also removed the benefit of their access to
the commuter-oriented and faster 0L bus route - if their Center bus stop for the 0L was
removed.

Domcianno Martinez stated that he rides the 0 and the 0L and said the bus stop along
Lincoln/Broadway at Center should remain. Stated he was a senior citizen and that
removing the stop at Center would require him to walk farther, which was not easy for
him to do. Stated that the bus stop at Center was well used by others as well from his
neighborhood.
Commented that his recent 0L or 0 bus operator almost passed him up as he waited at the
Center bus stop. Commented that that particular bus operator incorrectly told him that he
should not use the bus stop at Center already, since it was proposed for elimination, which
Mr. Martinez knew was only proposed at this time, not final.
Stated that he liked the idea of the proposed removal of the bus stop at Ohio, since it was
not as well used.
Stated that in general, since 1985 when he started using RTD services, he really liked the
value of the service offered by RTD and has only rarely had a rude bus operator, such as
the one he noted above.
Carol Streamer asked a question about route 3 and its proposed extended trips shown in
the service change flyer. Commented that the existing route 3 trips operating in the PM
often run late in the late afternoon and evening.
Commented that she currently has trouble riding RTD from Boulder back to Windsor
Gardens in the evenings. She said routes serving Windsor Gardens should operate later or
more frequently into the evening. She has been stranded in the past.
Commented that route 83L has detours, and bus stop boarding location changes, due to
Downtown events. These events and detours, with their street closures and bus changes
are increasingly common, especially for route 83L. Said there should be better signage for
riders about these temporary bus stop changes. Riders do not know where to catch the
bus.
Jessie Carter said he would pass on this comment directly to Tim Lucero, RTD bus ops, to
investigate further.
Robin Reilly stated she lived in Washington Park and regularly used the bus stop along
Lincoln/Broadway at Center. She said it should be retained. Removal of this bus stop
would require longer walks along fast-moving city arterial streets and it is increasingly
being well used. Stated that the alternate 0L bus stops were not conveniently accessible
to the Washington Park neighborhood.
Asked who at RTD proposed the elimination of the bus stop at Center. Jessie Carter and
Doug Monroe explained in detail, all the points in the rationale, including focusing on more
riders, faster service which is attractive to more riders, and more regular stop intervals.
Jessie and Doug explained that we were working with the City of Denver’s
Lincoln/Broadway to add 24-hour bus lanes for better OTP. RTD did not normally take bus
stop changes to the public for comment, but in this instance, believed it was needed.

Doug explained how the stop locations were selected based on their strategic location and
even spacing and explained how the Center bus stop was a legacy bus stop created at a
time prior to the establishment of the I-25/Broadway station.
Complained about a person she phoned at the City’s ‘Denver Moves’, they said it sounded
like it was already decided that the bus stop at Center would definitely be removed.
Jessie explained that it was still just a proposal and explained RTD’s next stops - including
final approval process via the RTD ops committee and at the RTD board meeting.
Karlyn Huffman commented that the Yale LRT station has no bus service on the weekends
and it should. Routes 27 and 46 should have expanded service, especially to the west of
this station along Yale toward Colorado Blvd closer to where I live. There also needs to be
a traffic signal on Yale in front of this station. There should also be an elevator installed
to get up from the street to the LRT platform at Yale, as she is not able to walk up the
ramp from the street.
Commented that she also was recently injured while riding RTD bus 27. The operator
jammed on the brakes and I fell to the floor and received a shoulder rotator cuff injury.
The operator walked me to the nearby King Soopers and I did not believe I was injured at
the time it happened. I know the operator called in my injury to dispatch at the time. I
filed a complaint over the phone. The operator’s name may be been Ray. She commented
that she also recently fell on another RTD bus.
Jessie Carter said he would phone her and get more specifics on the incident she said she
recently had on an RTD bus. She provided her phone number.
Also commented that a few weeks ago my route 46 operator refused to give her a
courtesy stop. This was after she had had rotator injury and the operator said ‘I don’t give
a damn’ and then he slammed on the brakes.
Bill Casson asked for detailed about the proposed change printed in the service change
flyer about route 206/236. Jessie explained that the proposed change would keep at least
hourly service mid-day and not a full elimination of service, which is a modification of the
printed service change proposal. Jessie explained that route 206 was very low ridership in
general and explained the general routing of the new 236.
Commented that if route 206 were ever eliminated, there would be a significant service
coverage gap in eastern Boulder.
Doug Monroe (RTD staff)
Asked those in the room who had commented on the proposed stop at Broadway/Lincoln
at Center being eliminated, if it might help for residents of Wash Park west, to potentially
have the existing bus stop at Exposition be served by the 0L. He explained the possible
rational for this potential alternate and asked if it might be a compromise.
One commenter was not sure, asked why spacing was so important, and said there is not
currently a signal at Exposition, while Center had one. She said this idea would not be all

that helpful. Doug explained how bus stops each have their own markets, and walksheds, and how if stops are too close together, they overlap in their rider markets. Doug
also noted that the City had long range plans to add a signal on Broadway at Exposition.
He reminded all that RTD was working closely with City of Denver and the 24-hour transit
lanes on Lincoln and Broadway.
Others in the room nodded that this concept might at least be better than no 0L service
access near Center/Exposition at all.
Commenter said route 40 should retain both nearside and farside bus stops on Colorado at
Alameda since there were other connecting bus routes there and the Nb nearside stop,
especially, is closer to Target where riders are carrying bags of groceries to/from the bus
stop.
Commenter said ‘Kudos’ to so many of RTD’s 0 and 0L bus operators who are doing a
really great job. Most drivers are very nice.
Commenter Also, please remind operators that a rider can actually buy a $9 fare on the 0L
or 0 to get to Denver Airport. Some operators don’t know this.

Glenarm Recreation Center
6:00 PM
Meeting was facilitated by Cesar Ochoa. There were 6 members of the public
there and there were no RTD Board Members in attendance.
Richard Andrews had concerns about the proposal and questions about how the service
would work. Route 43 needs to go into the 30th&Downing Station like it used to do.
Debra Hunter was disappointed to hear the proposal after experience the changes to
service with the University of Colorado A Line. She formerly would use the Route 38 for
trips between East Denver and Downtown, but now has to use the Route 34. The Route
34 seems to be aimed at serving the shelter on Smith Rd, rather than providing the service
the Route 38 provided in East Denver.
She also uses the A Line. Making connections is difficult and sometimes requires her to
wait up to 30 minutes if the train is delayed. She feels that the L Line proposal would
make connections necessary where she currently does not have to connect to anything
except the Route 34.
Blair Swanson disagrees with the cancellation of the Route 28 weekend service and does
not like the L Line proposal as it removes service from the area. She stated that 8 blocks
to the Route 43 is too far for the elderly to walk.
She believes the stop on Colorado Blvd at 16th should remain, given the walk distance to
14th Ave. She also requested a stop be added at Green Valley Ranch Blvd.-Andes Street.
Brian Linde agrees with everyone who is opposed to the L Line service proposal, stat theat
RTD is turning a 1 seat ride into a three seat ride for the area. The only way he would
agree with the change is if RTD were to extend the Route 43 to 10th and Osage. He also
suggested that the D Line be run on the weekends or have the H Line extended to
30th&Downing.
Helen Bushnell believes the bus stops being proposed for consolidation get a lot of use.
She believes this the effort to consolidate the bus stops is a part of a City of Denver
program that caters to the wealthy.
She suggested that petitions be used to get more people heard during the public meeting
process. She also stated that RTD has a dangerous stop at Kipling-Miller Street in that it
encourages an unsafe crossing.
Duncan Smith rides the bus and train regularly as he can. He is transit dependent, since
his car is in disrepair. He appreciates the service RTD provides

Additional Comments
I am writing to voice my concern about the
proposed elimination of the 0L stop at Center
and Broadway/Lincoln. As someone who lives
on Logan and Exposition, I have depended on
this stop the past 3 years. The proposed
service changes will mean I will have to drivethis means I will take a parking space at the
Broadway and I25 station or find street parking
around Alameda and Broadway- difficult to
impossible. Please keep the Center and
Broadway/Lincoln 0L stop. Feel free to contact
me with any questions and I appreciate your
consideration.
Please do not discontinue or reduce service to
the Lincoln and W. Center bus stop. I do not
have a car and depend on this stop to get to
work five days a week and to make routine
trips to grocery store.
In addition to myself many others relay on the
stop. In the early morning I often see many
riders that have come from the near by labor
finder business. These people too would be at
a disadvantage if service was reduced.
As a resident of the South Broadway area and
a user of the Ellsworth 0 line bus stop for my
daily commute, I object to the proposal to
eliminate/consolidate stops along the
Broadway/Lincoln corridor. If the city truly
intends to reduce personal motor vehicle
traffic along this corridor, there needs to be
greater incentive to residents to use public
transit, especially given the increase in
residential construction along this corridor.
Removing bus stops does the exact opposite
and would likely be detrimental to the disabled
and elderly, and can discourage their use of
transit. This also would make north-south
travel even more inaccessible for residents in
the heart of West Wash Park, since there is a
3/4 mile gap between Downing (12 line
service) and Broadway/Lincoln (0/0L). Taking
away stops on Broadway/Lincoln would
increase walking distance required from
residents in central West Wash Park (e.g. Pearl
St, Washington St, Clarkson St.) and make
transit less accessible. I ask that this proposal
be reconsidered and walked back.

I am urging RTD to reconsider removing the
Center Ave and Broadway/Lincoln bus stops.
Many people use this stop, more than
Alameda and 1st Ave on the 0L. It is our only
access for most folks in West Wash Park. The
Broadway bus station is difficult to get to from
our neighborhood because crossing Broadway
and Lincoln at that stop light is Dangerous.
Alameda is too far north and dangerous to
walk down because the sidewalks are too
narrow. I would like to talk to whoever is
making this decision at RTD. I am also going to
contact my city councilperson and our
neighborhood organization to alert the West
Wash Park community of your terrible and
shortsighted decision.
I'm writing in strong opposition to the
proposed consolidation of the 0 and 0L stops. I
use this route daily to get to work. The nearest
stop is already half a mile away. Removing the
stop on center would make my commute even
more lengthy. I once again stress that I hope
you reconsider these changes.
How can RTD justify these closings? You’re
eliminating a big segment of West Wash Park
riders. You can’t just eliminate Ohio and
Center and move it up to Virginia, there are a
lot of people that utilize those bus stops in the
morning and evening. Additionally, You have
to keep in place a bus stop between Alameda
and the Broadway station on Broadway! That’s
too much of a stretch, and there are many
people that use that location to get to West
Wash Park. For the past 3 years, I’ve only seen
an uptick in usage at Center and Lincoln. Either
provide a recount of your findings or leave a
bus stop that services West Wash Park for
everyone.
Please don't close the Ellsworth stops on
Broadway and Lincoln! I have been using those
stops since 1990. I live on Lincoln Street and
have put up with the bus noise and speeding
because I get rewarded with a close stop!
Please do not eliminate the 0L Northbound
stop at Lincoln and Center Avenue. This is a
highly used stop and would significantly reduce
the likelihood of me riding the bus. As a choice
rider, convenience and efficiency are key. I
never ride the 0 because it stops every block
and takes twice as long. Even if the 0 is
changed to stop less frequently, I will likely not
ride it. I currently walk further to take the 0L
and gladly do for the speed and efficiency.
I rarely take the bus home because the 0L does
not run late enough for me (I get off work
around 7:00 pm). So if you are changing
routes, please consider having the 0L run later
in the evenings

Please do not remove the Cedar Street stops
from the 0 line! The Alameda stops are filthy
and ive been harassed and felt very unsafe at
both! Plus to cross Broadway and Alameda at
rush hour is treacherous! My bus at Cedar has
almost never been late, and I ride almost daily.
Please also consider the number of elderly
residents in our neighborhood to whom an
extra block or two make a huge difference.
Please please reconsider!
I am writing as a 0 line rider to say I agree with
the following deletions and modifications. Two
of the stations as I have listed I do not have an
opinion on regarding the change as I do not
use those stops. The other stations already
have stops one block north and south of them.
What is going to happen at the 7th and
Broadway (downtown) stop? Please don't
close that stop, instead, close Denver Health
one block south as not many people use that
stop.
Please do not remove the RTD's 0 or 0L
routes/stop on Broadway/Lincoln. This would
effectively eliminate our neighborhood's
access to the 0L. It would also reduce the
amount of stops for WWP on the 0. We use
this bus to go to the Art Museum and the
Denver Public Library and also to go to Colfax.
Please change Bus Route 12 to stop at the
Blake and 38th A-line Light rail station.
I fully agree that with the advent of light rail
there should be fewer bus stops in the West
Wash Park area. RTD has spent considerable
time and money upgrading public
transportation to light rail, and should
continue to push ridership by decreasing traffic
congesting buses. Please consider this email in
support of fewer buses and more light rail.
This would benefit me. I ride the 14 to the
Broadway Light Rail Station to catch a train
Monday through Friday and have to find
alternate transportation when I am downtown
later than usual. I also occasionally take it on
weekends for special events.

I'm writing in regards to service changes to the
28/28B westbound service. Let me say I have
been a commuter for the past 13 years, and
have been happy with the service up until
about last year. Service used to run every 15
minutes but has been cut back to every 30
minutes between 3 and 5:24 pm which are
peak times for westbound travel. Buses are
always packed and standing room only due to
the cuts in service. I work at Anschutz Medical
campus. I take the 28 to Larimer and transfer
to the 20 downtown. The most frustrating part
for me and others is trying to make tight
connections. I rarely if ever make my transfer
to the 28 at 5:24. Most of the time it's missed
by near minutes if the 20 bus isn't right behind
it. I've asked for the bus to be held and was
told it was only done as a courtesy. The
problem lies in a 40-45 minute wait time for
the next 28. I wouldn't mind if it was only a 15
minute wait for the next bus, but 40-45
minutes when the weather is extremely hot,
cold, rainy, snowing or hail isn't fun, nor safe
for passengers without bus shelters. I could
possibly take the 20 bus til Pierce, but it would
mean a 5 block walk back to my home
compared to a 1 block. That most likely won't
happen since I'm a nurse and been on my feet
all day. Would you please consider an overhaul
of your afternoon 28/28B westbound service
at the next meeting for schedule changes 10
run every 15 minutes til atleast 6:30-7pm. It
would be much appreciated and a welcome
relief for us westbound commuters.
I’m not sure I understand why you would be
eliminating all stops (route 40) at Colorado and
Alameda. That is a major intersection and
there is more than one East/West route that
stops at that intersection. Did you really mean
that one of the stops in each direction will be
eliminated? That would make more sense.
The Proposed August 2017 Service Changes
flier that I got on the bus references
elimination of bus stops at "Colorado and
Alameda, both directions" for the Route 40. I
am opposed to elimination of these stops.
Colorado and Alameda is a major intersection
with multiple bus routes. For the convenience
of the many riders who use these routes, all
four Route 40 stops at Colorado and Alameda
must be maintained. Thank you for your
consideration of my concerns.
So you would stop the 40 from stopping at
Alameda when it is a connection point for
Route 3, 83D and L. That makes no sense.
Which translates to "we are just going to make
dumb changes without care to how it impacts
our riders." It's a MAJOR intersection with
high usage. Every time I get on or off there,
there's Always 3-5 others getting off/on. So to
say it is a low used stop means someone is
either lying, don't care, or as an alternative
motive, or a combination there of! ??Some of
these changes just absolutely do not have any
common sense behind them....

August Service Changes
There are 700 people working at the new
Amazon facility on 38th near Windsor.
Currently it is a 1 1/4 mile walk from the
nearest stop. A year ago the old route 43 went
right past it on 38th (the benches at the stops
are still there). Could you please, please route
the 42 that way again!
I wish you had a bus route #72 that would take
people to Apex Parks and Rec.13150 W. 72nd
Ave, Arvada, CO 80005 and since there is no
bus route that will drop me off in front of it, I
am not able to go there. I cannot walk long
ways, from 4th bus number 72 and 52.
I wish you would continue the every half hour
#76 both North and South bound to
Broomfield. The wait is too long. Get a shorter
bus for this purpose
My family and I were just impacted by the
service changes to the 205 route in May.
Because my family relies on the 205 for
weekday commuting, we're particularly
interested in what changes are being proposed
for August. I would like to provide this
comment for consideration: "The 205 is a
critical route connecting Gunbarrel to Boulder,
and allowing free movement between a
somewhat isolated community and
downtown." It just so happens that we located
in Gunbarrel as a one-car household in large
part because of the existence of the 205 line
and our Eco-passes. PLEASE keep your level of
service high on the 205 line and please try to
keep times from moving around too much as it
does affect our ability to get kids to school and
us to work."
I heard that the 206 was going to be
canceling half the route. I wanted to let you
know that allot of people use this route get to
Manhattan Middle school, It is also important
to service the neighborhood.
I'm calling to complain about the service
change that will happen in the fall. The farthest
south the 206 is going to go 55th & Arapahoe.
Please don't change this.
My family relies upon the 206/206F to
transport our children to and from Fairview.
Many students use this route as the school bus
available does not have convenient stops and
times. Please do NOT discontinue this route
service south of 55th and Arapahoe. The
families in the Arapahoe Ridge and Keewaydin
neighborhoods need this route.
Please, please don't cancel the 206/206F south
of 55th and Arapahoe as proposed. My 15yo
daughter takes the Jump from Arapahoe and
Wicklow and then transfers to the 206 at
Arapahoe and Conestoga every morning to get
to Fairview High School, and back again every
afternoon. There are students who need that
bus to get to school. If ridership is low, perhaps
you could run the 206 for the school commute
- southbound between 6:30 and 8:30am and
northbound between 2:30 and 4:30pm?

Manhattan, Summit, Southern Hills, and
Fairview. Buses are packed and there are
usually two buses in tandem to provide room
for so many riders. Please keep this bus route
in place and do not make changes.
Our son and many other students rides that
route south of 55th and Arapahoe every day to
school. It seems that the ridership is quite
high, and we would strongly object to this
change. It seems that there is low ridership
north of 55th and Arapahoe. Was that perhaps
the intended change, rather than south?

Attachment B – Summary of Electronically Received Comments & Public Meetings–
August Service Changes

My kid is using Route 206 shuttle between our
home and school everyday during school time.
She has been using the bus since 2015 and will
continue to take 206 until completing high
school. At this stop there are three kids taking
206 daily.
Regarding the prosed August 2017 change for
route 2016. Please don't discontinue the
service at 55th St. & Arapahoe Ave. for Route
206. My kid needs ride 206 at Arapahoe&55th
to and from school. Thank you for your
considerations.
Can you give me details about service changes
to the 206, as well as a map of the new 236?
As written it seems the 206 will only go
between Boulder Junction and Arapaho and
55th, which is only about 10 minutes one way.
Will it no longer go to Fairview High School? I
and others (including students at Fairview and
Southern Hills Middle School) pick it up there
to get to east Boulder, and vice versa. If it
discontinues, I’ll have to take the SKIP, transfer
to the DASH, and then transfer to the 236, and
that assumes the 236 goes up to 55th and
Pearl, and not just on Foothills to get to Pearl
(if not I’ll have to transfer to the 208 as well,
meaning four buses to get to a spot that
currently is served by one). Or I’d have to take
the SKIP downtown and transfer to the 208,
but that’s about an hour trip, nearly twice as
long as the 206 today. If those are my options
then I will be unable to ride the bus anymore,
which isn’t a good option for me.
What are the specific route changes for the
206 bus route in Boulder? Effective 8/27? It
says south of 55th but I am hoping for
clarification. This is a busy route for kids during
the school year. Thank you.

August Service Changes
Please, please, please don't discontinue the
206 route that transports all of our
neighborhood kids to Manhattan, Summit,
Southern Hills and Fairview. My siblings and I
all rode it, 30+ years ago and now my 5
children ride it. I have even hopped on
occasionally. The overall ridership might be
low (so reducing the mid day service would
make sense) but please don't take away the
bus in the morning and afternoon!
I request you do not make changes to RTD 206
route. My grandchildren ride this route to visit
me in at my home in Country Club Park
subdivision each week. If you take this route
away, then will have no way to visit me. If we
want to be a green city, we need to have
alternate transportation. To encourage people
to take the bus, we have to have routes that
reach important destinations. I see the middle
school and high school children taking the 206
each morning and afternoon. I cannot imagine
how many of them will get to school without
this route. Thank you for reading this. I cannot
attend the community meeting otherwise I
would share this message.
I read that the 206 line south of 55th and
Arapahoe in Boulder is being discontinued
starting 8/27. Many students use this line to
get to our neighborhood's middle and high
schools. Discontinuing the route would be a
disservice to our neighborhood and a resource
that we rely on. Perhaps schedule changes to
accomodate the school season/schedule is a
better solution?
I'm writing to find out more about the
proposed route changes for 206. The
statement says it would discontinue service
south of Arapahoe and 55th due to low
ridership. Is that a typo? This route is heavily
used by students to Manahattan, Fairview, and
Southern Hills; all south of Arapahoe. Would
RTD no longer be providing service to these
schools?
This question refers to the "Proposed weekday
schedule adjustments: Boulder 206/206F. It is
proposed to discontinue weekday midday
service south of 55th Street and Arapahoe due
to low ridership." My question is this: would
you keep the morning hours, and afternoon
hours for school children? My child rides the
bus up to Fairview High School and home each
day.
I am writing to urge you to maintain the 206
Route in its current form. It is an invaluable
service and used by a great number of
students at Manhattan, Summit, and Fairview
schools. Thank you.
Re: the 206 local and seasonal weekday route
South of 55th and Arapahoe. Please do not
discintinue this service. I moved to the Park
East neighborhood of Boulder with the 206
stop outside my house., this is a huge benefit
and my kinds will soon be riding this bus daily
to/from school should they go to Boulder or
Fairview High School

Attachment B – Summary of Electronically Received Comments & Public Meetings–
August Service Changes
Per the change to Route 206/206F in Boulder
that will discontinue service south of 55th
Street and Arapahoe Avenue. Our two sons are
now in college. In high school, we had large
dependency on that bus before they could
drive to school. Our house is 4 miles from
Fairview high school so if there was a day we
could not drive them and it was too cold for
them to bike, we needed that bus to get them
to high school. We are advocating RTD keep
the south portion of route 206/206F.
Please do not discontinue 206F/206 service
inBoulder during mid-day routes. This route
serves students in four area schools and is
essential when there are early release days
and late start days (every wednesday), as well
as being essential for regular travel to and
from those schools for middle and high school
students.
We have heard of changes to route 206 in
Boulder through the Eisenhower
neighborhoods. Many of our kids depend on
this as an option to get to school. It would be
terrible to see changes to this route for our
entire community. I hope that you reconsider
these changes as this route is a dependency for
our kids and I worry about a safe alternative.
RTD is proposing changes to the 206 which
goes through our neighborhood up to
Manhattan, Summit & Southern Hills middle
schools/Fairview High School. Details here:
http://www.rtd-denver.com/servicechangesaugust2017.shtml
We strongly object to this change; lots of
neighborhood kids including our own use this
bus to go to middle school and high school in
Boulder.
The 206 bus is the only available bus service to
Fairview High School for many students in East
Boulder. It would be a great hardship for many
families if this service were discontinued.
Many homes in East Boulder, although in the
Fairview district, are several miles away from
Fairview, making walking impracticable. Riding
a bike to Fairview from East Boulder would not
be a good option, due to the busy streets.
Many parents with jobs would have to be late
to work in order to drive their children.
Some families probably could afford to buy
cars for their teenagers and let them drive
themselves, but not every family could afford
this, and many freshmen and sophomores are
too young to have driving licenses. In addition,
eliminating bus service would add even more
traffic on Table Mesa Drive and South
Broadway during busy times of the day. Please
retain the 206 bus service.
Don't cancel the 206 service! This is used by
many students in the neighborhood who take
the bus to Manhattan, Summit, Southern Hills
and Fairview. Many families would be
impacted by this change & would result in
more cars being on the road.

Please do not eliminate the 206 route in
Boulder! My children use this route as
transportation to and from school. We are
considered "too close" to our middle school to
qualify for bus service from BVSD so we rely
heavily upon RTD. Please consider keeping
early morning and after school hours for this
segment of the community!
I read with dismay that you are considering
cancelling service south of Baseline. Did I read
that correctly that this critical link to Fairview
HS and South Boulder will be gone? Before I
write in more, please update me on the
proposed change to route 206/206F.
I see you're proposing discontinuing the 206
south of Arapahoe. However, that's the only
bus that directly runs from through this section
of town directly to Fairview HS. Riding up to
Broadway and catching the Skip down to
Fairview - the only other bus that runs there would be substantially slower. There are kids
who ride this bus every morning and
afternoon. Why don't you just run it mornings
and afternoons but stop the mid-day runs.
Every half hour from 6:24am to 7:50pm is
probably excessive, but nothing at all leaves a
big gap in transportation options and
discourages kids from developing public transit
habits. Our daughter will be riding the 206 to
school in a year and a half if it still exists - if it
doesn't, she may not go to Fairview at all since
we can't/won't drive her every day.
Do NOT discontinue the service on the 206
route. Many, many kids ride this bus to
Summit Middle School and Fairview H.S. This is
a very important bus for many kids and
families. PLEASE keep this service!!!! We have
used it for many years and will continue to do
so.
I have been informed that the 206 route in
Boulder will be limited to services north of
Arapahoe. I use this bus almost daily between
the Laurel Avenue stop to 55th and Arapahoe
Ave. Countless other people use this to get to
work and many, many students use this to get
to Fairview High School. Closing that portion of
the route would be a huge inconvenience to
hundreds of Boulder residents. I strongly
protest this action and hope you will
reconsider! We are trying to consciously
reduce our carbon footprint and support RTD
by using this route and this decision would
severely undermine our efforts and create a
tremendous amount of inconvenience for
Boulder riders.
Please don't cut off 206 bus service south of
55th and Arapahoe. Our neighborhood uses
bus to get kids to FHS and Summit.

Attachment B – Summary of Electronically Received Comments & Public Meetings–
August Service Changes
I am sad and disappointed that you are
considering getting rid of the 206 route. I think
that would be a terrible idea. This route runs
past the school I teach on Eisenhower Dr. and I
know many children who rely on this route to
get to and from school, including my son. This
route is why so many kids in our neighborhood
as well as neighborhoods nearby that are
serviced by this route can feel safe going to
and from middle school and high school
regardless of weather. RTD has given my son
independence and responsibility in a safe
environment for him and his friends and MANY
other students. I would think that taking this
route away would encourage younger kids
having to bike across town (more dangerous
than the bus and issues when weather is poor),
kids driving earlier than would otherwise,
more driving traffic along school routes (less
safe and environmentally a poor decision). This
route is why we allowed our son to go the
school he chose.
Please don't change the 206 route. Students
use this during the school year to go to
Manhattan Middle School, Summit Middle
School, Southern Hills Middle School, and
Fairview High School. The bus is so full they
add extras to the morning and afternoon
times. If they cannot use this the traffic
increase at these schools would be ridiculous.
Many parents go to work earlier than their
children go to school and can't take their kids.
This would be especially tough on students
living in the apartments at Manhattan and
Baseline. Please don't change such an
important route to our community.
Please continue offering the 206 route south of
Arapahoe and 55th during the hours when
students need to travel to school (Summit,
Fairview, Southern Hills). If this route is
canceled the impact would be huge for the
families in my neighborhood (SW of 55th and
Arapahoe). Maybe discontinue the times
between 9 and 2:30 and in the evening but the
morning commute time and afternoon
commute have high ridership.
Please do not make changes to the 206 Route
which will affect a lot of kids taking the bus
from the Arapahoe Ridge neighborhood to
several middle and high schools, including
Manhattan, Southern Hills, Summit, and
Fairview.
Boulder Route 206 is very important for
getting middle and high school students to
Summit and Southern Hills Middle Schools, and
Fairview High School. We greatly appreciate
and need this service and hope that due
diligence in considering school schedules is
considered for the proposed route changes.
More service in the morning (7-9) and after
2:30pm would ensure more riders. Summit in
particular often has a weird schedule, starts
earlier in the fall and ends later in the spring so
please consider that as well when switching to
Summer schedules. I will try to come to the
community meeting but please

Please DO NOT eliminate service south of
Arapahoe on route 206 in Boulder. DOZENS of
kids ride that route each morning (and
presumable each afternoon) to and from
schools - Summit middle, Southern Hills
Middle, Fairview HS, Manhattan middle. I see
them all standing at the bus stops each
morning. Public transportation makes
attending those schools from this
neighborhood possible. That is the only route
that I know of that serves those schools and
this would be a HUGE problem for many
families whose kids cannot drive or do not
have other transportation.
I just saw the proposed change for Route 206:
"It is proposed to discontinue service south of
55th Street and Arapahoe Avenue due to low
ridership. Proposed schedule adjustments
would also be made." My son has taken this
bus from home to the Southern Hills Middle
School daily since year 2015. I knew two other
students who have taken this bus to
Manhattan Middle School every day. I highly
hope that this change can be reverted. We
really need this bus at the 55th St. & Arapahoe
Avenue stop.
Do NOT change the 206 schedule! We live in
the Arapahoe Ridge neighborhood near
Eisenhower Elementary school in Boulder and
have 2 students that rely on this bus to get to
Fairview. Please, please do not change what is
working for the many students that depend on
this bus.
Please, Please, Please do not discontinue the
206/206F. My family completely relies on this
to get my son to school every day from
Eisenhower/McKinley to Tantra/Table Mesa,
and many other kids in our neighborhood do
as well. It is invaluable to us as a family, and
one of the reasons we chose the middle school
(and could choose the HS) my son wants to
attend. There is no school bus to either of the
schools.
The August changes list 206 service
discontinued south of Arapahoe. More detail,
please? This bus no longer will go to Fairview
HS or South Boulder Rec Center? Will there be
any service at the Rec Center at all?
If not, how about some of the Skip runs going
that way instead of on Lehigh? I don't use the
bus to/from the Rec Center often, but on
occasion. A friend uses it once or twice a week,
connecting to Dash for travel to/from
Louisville.
Please do NOT make any changes to the 206
route. This route is critical for getting my
children to middle and high school each day. In
addition, they ride this bus to water polo
practice up at South Boulder recreation center.
Without the 206, the kids would have to ride
and transfer, which would add significant time
to their commute. I strongly oppose any
changes to the 206 bus route.

Please do not cancel or revise route 206 in
Boulder (south of Arapahoe). My two children
use it to get to Southern Hills Middle School
and Fairview High School. At a minimum,
please keep it during the school hours (i.e.: 69a and 2-7p) Having extended hours in the
morning and evening is useful for the kids
involved in after school activities.
Do NOT discontinue the service on the 206

Summit Middle School and Fairview H.S. This is
a very important bus for many kids and
families. PLEASE keep this service!!!! We have
used it for many years and will continue to do
so.
My name is Donna Sparks and I live at Golden
West Senior residence. I would like you to reconsider removing the loop of the 209 Route
that comes to
Golden West and also to continue the route
further on Mohawk so it goes past the Kaiser
Medical Facility. We have many residents here
who are Kaiser
patients and lots of them cannot walk the 3
blocks to 30th & Aurora to catch the 209 bus.
And they also could not walk the distance from
on Mohawk from
Baseline to the Kaiser Facility. Please do not
make the proposed changes that will put our
residents at risk.
I live in West Wash Park and use the OL bus
daily to commute to and from my job. I walk
half a mile to get to the OL stop at Lincoln and
Center, and rely on the OL service to get me
conveniently to my work. If the Center stop
were eliminated, as proposed, I would need to
cross Lincoln and Broadway at the I25
underpass, which has quite a short walk signal,
and cut through the parking are under I25 to
arrive at the OL stop. This route is less reliable
timing-wise due to the street crossings, and I
do not like to walk through the I25 underpass
parking area when it is dark out. The current
Center and Lincoln stop works well for me. I
hope that you will consider the ridership needs
of the West Wash Park community and the
value of residents near the Lincoln corridor
opting for public transit rather than using
personal vehicles, and I hope that you will opt
to leave the OL stop at Center Street.

August Service Changes
I have read about proposed changes to the 0L.
The changes eliminate the stop in the West
Washington Park neighborhood. Our only
other option would be Alameda and/or
Broadway. These two locations are already
crammed for parking. Many people at the
Center location walk to the stop to get on/off
the bus. I see other people parking in the
neighborhood, then taking the bus at the
Center stop. So if everyone has to get to the
Alameda/Broadway locations, there's going to
be a great deal of residential parking in those
neighborhoods clogging the streets and the
areas. I highly recommend you don't remove
the Center St. stop servicing the W. Wash Park
Neighborhood.
I noticed that there is a proposed change to
remove the Center/Lincoln 0L bus stop. This is
a terrible idea! I (and many other people) use
this stop to take the 0L to and from work
everyday. Please leave this stop or I will be
forced to stop using RTD and drive to work.
I'm writing to encourage RTD to maintain 0L
bus service to the Lincoln/Broadway bus stops
at E Center Avenue. As an employee working
in the Denver Design Center, easy access into
Denver downtown is a critical component to
our work life. The Center Avenue bus stops
would benefit from extended 0L service, not
eliminating it! I would suggest 0L service in the
morning until 8:00, and in the evenings until
6:00. Please maintain 0L service to the Center
Avenue bus stops. These stops service not
only our work community in the Design Center,
but also the West Wash Park neighborhood.
RTD busses should be an asset to all Denver
neighborhoods, not only those using the
Broadway light rail parking. By maintaining 0L
service to Center Avenue, multiple
communities benefit from quick, convenient
access into downtown.
Why is RTD planning to elminate the OL stop at
Center and Lincoln & Center and Broadway.
These two stops are heavily used by the
residents of West Washington Park and riders
that can't get into the RTD Broadway Parking
lots because those lots are overfilled. from 7
am to 8am every workday the OL is filled with
professionals that commute into the captial to
work for the state and various businesses
downtown. This is a very different clientel than
the O riders. The elimiation of the OL stop at
Lincoln & Center and Broadway and Center will
push these riders to the 0 and a longer
commute, or they will simply stop riding the
bus at all and drive because the O is a much
longer commute because it stops at so many
locations along lincoln and broadway.

August Service Changes
I lived in the Denver metro area for 15 years
and was a regular RTD rider and, even now,
when I come up to do things in Denver, I ride
RTD. For a long time I’ve thought that the 0
stopped too frequently on Lincoln and
Broadway. I never understood why it had to
stop every block when most people, even ADA
users, are perfectly capable of going a block or
two between the stop and their destination. I
would sometimes avoid using the 0 just
because the length of time it took on that line
was longer than alternatives. So, in summary, I
support removing stops so that the 0 is
stopping once every quarter mile. I never used
the Route 40 but I support doing the same
thing with any routes that have stops more
frequent than ¼ mile. I think that is a smart
decision and will speed up these routes for
those who use them. Also, this could
potentially reduce the cost of replacing bus
stop signs/posts and reduce the wear and tear
on the buses since they would be braking
fewer times, at least in theory. I think RTD is a
great service and I wish we had service like
yours down here in Colorado Springs.
Just when I have been bragging to everyone I
know about how wonderful it is to ride the bus
every day to work - it sounds like you are
taking away my bus stop. I’m not sure I
understand what “consolidate stops at 13th,
9th, 1st, and Alameda” means, but if means
you are taking away the Center Ave stop, then
I’m VERY disappointed. I take the bus because
it’s quick, easy and a short walk. All that
changes if I have to walk all the way to
Alameda.
Parking downtown is going to be more and
more expensive and scarce. Soon more people
like myself, who live in Wash Park and work
downtown are going to wish they could take
the bus. But if my immediate neighbors realize
they have to walk all the way to Alameda, or
worse - to Broadway Station, they will not be
taking the bus. At a time when you should be
preparing for more riders, you are taking away
the opportunity. This change will put even
more cars back on the streets. With traffic
becoming more and more of a problem, it is
unbelievable that you would make it more
difficult for those who wish to take public
transportation. You should be doing everything
possible to make public transportation more
available, not less available.
Please bring back the 3:55 pm 55L! I
understand the merger of the 55s and the 55L
routes, but there were a LOT of us that took
the 3:55 bus from Union Station.
Unfortunately the bus that now leaves at 3:46
pm is too early for a lot of us to make. Now I
have to add another 15 minutes to my
commute to wait for the 4:09 pm bus... :(

August Service Changes
Recent changes of the BOLT skip the stop at
Hwy 119/Foothill at several trips in the rush
hours. This certainly causes some
inconvenience to the regular passengers
boarding the bus at the stop.
If a stop could be added at the
Valmont/Foothill Parkway to BOLT and J buses,
it would be very helpful to the passengers to
board the BOLD and J buses in the rush hours.
Thank you for your consideration for this.
Would be very pleased to see increases in the
frequency of the C line (even if it means a
slightly reduced freq. in the D line) Thank you
for everything you do for us! Love our lightrail!
I recently reviewed some of the proposed
changes, specifically to the D and C light rail
lines. Please do not decrease the frequency of
the rush hour D lines. I'm sure you have done
analysis but the usage of the D line by
downtown commuters as well as Auraria
students far outweighs the C line usage.
Decreasing the frequency and adding a car will
result in a significant inconvenience and delay.
If you would like any additional detail please
let me know.
I ride the D line to and from work. My only
concern is the 15 minute interval will cause the
train to be more crowded than it already is for
seating. It is hard enough for the over 65.
Proposing to reduce the D like to every 30
minutes is a bad idea. That changes it from
reliable and frequent service in Five Points to
something that will no longer be convenient or
easy. I use the train and find it comfortable
and easy because of its frequency. Please
consider my concerns
There was a 3:07pm DASH to Lafyette from the
21103 stop in Boulder, and it was awesome.
Now it's gone and the 3:24 Dash that is
supposed to be here is at least 10 minutes late
and probably packed full. That sucks, now I'm
uncomfortable and late for work. Doesn't
seem worth the $100/month I spend in a pass.
How about if you get rid of busses you drop
the bus fare? Or bring back more busses.
Cool? Thanks!
Unfortunately I am unable to make the town
hall meeting to discuss proposed changes but I
would like to express my support for the
increased frequency of E line trains to every 15
minutes. I commute from Lincoln to Union

difficult to align times with the current 30

proposed change would provide me and many
other riders more flexibility in schedules.

Hi, I have been riding this train for many years
and have had very few issues. It was an
enjoyable ride.However, currently you have a
driver that is consistently 7 – 8 minutes late,
which in turn, I miss my connection and have
to wait around for over 30 minutes for the next
one.My travel time is already an hour adding
this extra 35 minutes on makes it too long.
Until this driver is replaced I will not be riding
RTD, as well as several others, 5 to be precise,
that have the same issue with the same
driver.This is the northbound train that leave
Lincoln station at 3:08 pm. Every other driver
that has driven that train has had no issues
getting to Union Station at a reasonable time.
We have written to the customer care email
address, but that falls on deaf ears.

I reviewed the current changes and I noticed
that F line service would remain at 30 minute
intervals. I am continually frustrated by the
lack of service for this critical leg of light rail. As
it services both the core of downtown and the
Auroria Campus, this service is under-served
with cars that often filled to capacity requiring
a significant number of passengers to stand for
the entire journey. In the morning, unless you
get on in the first 3-4 stations there is often no
seats available. On the return in the afternoon,
you need to be on by 18th and Stout or at least
16th or else you are stuck standing. D and R
trains run more often and have longer trains.
Why can’t additional cars be put on the F line
to accommodate passengers? Two Mineral
trains will go by for every Lincoln train. Using
the 16th street Mall Shuttle could be an option
but recently I walked from Arapahoe to Union
station looking for a shuttle but one never
came by despite there being easttbound
shuttles at every corner. Not sure where the
shuttles were sitting going westbound. I like
using the trains but service can be frustrating
with lack of seats, dirty cars, and infrequent
service for special events (i.e. Pepsi Center
events) Why can’t extra service be coordinated
when events are occurring?
I would like to know if you foresee any service
changes in the FF1/FF3 routes on June 11th
due to the Ironman race in Boulder.
I am curious when the greyhound buses will
join union station. Thanks so much for your
response.

Call-n-Ride Amendment for New Contract

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to amend the recently awarded ADA paratransit services
contracts with MV Transportation and Via Mobility Services (per solicitation #16-DH-047) to include the
provision of Call-n-Ride services. The amendment to the MV Transportation contract is for three years
for $13,110,752, with two one-year options, option year 1 is for $4,587,223 and option year 2 is for
$4,797,357. Fuel is considered a pass through. Fuel is estimated at $1,206,599 for the first three
years and with option year 1 at $426,569 and option year 2 at $439,367. The total not to exceed cost
for the 5-year period for MV Call-n-Ride services and fuel is $24,567,867. The amendment to the Via
Mobility Services contract is also for three years for $12,700,984, with two one-year options, option
year 1 is for $2,642,063 and option year 2 is for $2,753,714. Fuel is considered a pass through. Fuel
is estimated at $671,325 for the first three years with option year 1 at $237,334 and option year 2 at
$244,454. The total not to exceed amount for the 5-year period for Via Call-n-Ride services and fuel is
$13,854,096.
BACKGROUND
On November 9, 2016, RTD issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) soliciting technical and price proposals
to provide Access-a-Ride and Call-n-Ride services. Call-n-Ride services were included in the Access-aRide services RFP because these services had been assigned to and were operated by ADA paratransit
service providers under the existing contracts. Past experience has shown that the cost to provide Calln-Ride service is lower when combined with Access-a-Ride service because of reduced overhead costs.
All of the existing Call-n-Ride services (with the exception of the Evergreen CNR) were divided into two
(2) service packages and proposers were allowed to bid on one or two packages. Proposers were
required to bid on Access-a-Ride service in order to also bid on Call-n-Ride service (Call-n-Ride service
was not a “stand alone” service option). Proposers were not required to submit a separate proposal for
Call-n-Ride service, but they were required to detail how they would address the unique operational
requirements of the service.
The Call-n-Rides included in each package are as follows:
Package A
Arapahoe
Belleview
Dry Creek
Golden
Green Mountain
Lone Tree
Meridian
North Inverness
Orchard

Package B
Brighton
Broomfield
Federal Heights
Interlocken
Longmont
Louisville
Superior

The new contracts for ADA paratransit service include the option for the assignment of Call-n-Ride
service so that Call-n-Ride service can be assigned to those contracts.
DISCUSSION
Subsequent to the evaluation of the Access-a-Ride RFP responses and recommendation for contract
award, the Call-n-Ride proposals were evaluated. Only proposers that were recommended to provide
Access-a-Ride service were considered to provide Call-n-Ride services. These proposers were MV
Transportation, Transdev, and Via Mobility Services. The Call-n-Ride proposals were evaluated on the
following criteria: a) understanding/approach and organization for implementation (40%); b) experience
of firm and individuals proposed for key positions and disciplines (25%); c) Small Business Enterprise
(SBE) Submittal / Compliance (5%) and d) price (30%). The proposal evaluations highlighted the
following:
MV Transportation has operated Call-n-Ride service for approximately eleven years. MV Transportation
proposed a team comprised of experienced Call-n-Ride managers and drivers, and it has provided quality
Call-n-Ride service throughout its tenure. The MV Transportation facility is located in the south metro
area, which provides good access for the Call-n-Rides. MV Transportation bid on package A.
Via Mobility Services has operated Call-n-Ride service for approximately seventeen years. The
management team is well experienced in the provision of Call-n-Ride service. Via Mobility currently
provides Call-n-Ride service from a facility in the Boulder area and a facility in the Denver area. This
allows a quicker response time in case of vehicle maintenance problems and cuts down on excessive
deadhead mileage and fuel expenses. Via Mobility Services bid on package B.
Transdev does not have any experience operating Call-n-Ride service for RTD. Additionally, the
Transdev cost proposal was higher than the other proposer. Transdev bid on package B.
The evaluation of the Call-n-Ride service proposals and pricing resulted in a recommendation to assign
Call-n-Ride Package A to MV Transportation under the ADA paratransit contract and Call-n-Ride Package
B to Via Mobility Services under the ADA paratransit contract. The contracts to provide these services
are scheduled to be effective October 1, 2017.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for the provision of the first year of service under this contract are included in the 2017 budget.
There are no proposed start-up costs, and therefore, there is no start-up cost impact on the 2017
budget. Funds will be requested in future budgets for the provision of service in future years.
ALTERNATIVES:
1)
Assign Call-n-Ride service to MV Transportation and Via Mobility Services as
recommended. This is recommended as both contractors’ personnel have Call-n-Ride
experience and can provide the direct supervision for a smooth contract transition.
2)
Do not assign to either contractor. Separate Call-n-Ride service from the ADA contract
and put the Call-n-Ride services out to bid under a separate contractor. This alternative is
not recommended, as the cost will most likely be more expensive as Call-n-Ride would be
a standalone service and the RTD would lose the economies of scale associated with the
ADA contract.

Authorization to enter into a contract with
M.A.I.O.R. Sri, for a Fixed Route Scheduling
and
Run-Cutting
Software
Application
(16DO018)

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations & Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to award a contract
for the new Fixed Route Scheduling and Runcutting Software Application to M.A.I.O.R. Sri (M.A.I.O.R),
in an amount not to exceed $4,000,000.00. The price includes the period of performance base of four
years and six one-year options (total ten years).
BACKGROUND
RTD’s Fixed Route Scheduling and Runcutting application is a core component in the development of bus
and rail operation plans. The software is used to handle the complex task of organizing and manipulating
time and spatial data for the development of route services, public information and operator
schedules/runcutting. Runcutting is the process of developing operator assignments (runs) from a pool of
vehicle “blocks” which are vehicle assignments derived from the public timetables. This is an iterative
process conducted in accordance with RTD’s Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA). Runcutting directly
impacts operator resources and work assignments. Optimizing operators’ work with vehicle blocks
creates a more efficient operator and vehicle utilization and reduces operational costs.
The scheduling and runcutting application is the central source of truth and a primary interface for
several major systems including but not limited to; Driver pay calculations, Public Information Display
System (PIDS), RTD website, Customer Care, TIES, CAD/AVL, etc… RTD requires a modern technical
platform to assure ongoing quality scheduling, runcutting and data integration with all the major
systems.
RTD’s current Fixed Route Scheduling and Runcutting application is over seventeen-years old and needs
to be replaced with modern technology. Because of operational changes and growth, the legacy system,
no longer meets RTD’s current needs, future needs and quality standards. Issues with the legacy system
that impacts the District on a daily basis include but are not limited to:





Ongoing Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Control (QC) concerns requiring RTD to regularly
create manual work-around processes that are labor intensive and error prone which redirects
RTD staff away from other business priorities.
RTD’s growth outpaced the current legacy system’s capabilities (i.e. Annually, from 50 days of
special services to 200 days; rail operations and fleet growth)
RTD’s bus and rail operations have changed since the original implementation requiring new
technology and expanded functionality to generate the most cost effective runcutting and
resource utilization strategies.

Packet Pg. 91

2.12.J

The Service Development department determined the replacement of the existing Fixed Route
Scheduling & Runcutting system is absolutely necessary to assure the District’s ability to continue; “to
meet our constituents’ present and future public transit needs by providing safe, clean, reliable,
courteous, accessible, and cost-effective service throughout the District.” Given the complexity of the
Fixed Route Scheduling and Runcutting application and processes, the business owner and stakeholders
completed a thorough due diligence assessment and identified requirements to replace the legacy
system.
DISCUSSION
To assure RTD’s ongoing ability to meet their mission and commitment to their constituents, RTD must
replace the legacy Fixed Route Scheduling and Runcutting system. The new system will be modern,
configurable and fully supported that meets RTD’s requirements, quality standards and future demands.
RTD advertised an RFP publically to provide a proposal for design, testing, training, implementation and
support for a Fixed Route Scheduling and Runcutting system for the next ten years. RTD received six
proposals.
The evaluation team consisted of personnel from the following departments; Service Development,
Service Development Support, Service Planning and Scheduling and IT. The proposals were reviewed in
accordance with the evaluative criteria as set forth in the RFP for this procurement including: fulfilling
RTD specified design and functionality requirements, cost, functional strength, experience, qualifications,
project plan and schedule. After reviewing the submitted proposals, interviews with vendors and
obtaining clarifications, the evaluation team unanimously selected M.A.I.O.R., as the preferred Fixed
Route Scheduling & Runcutting vendor to move forward in the procurement process. The reasons for
selecting M.A.I.O.R. Sri. include but are not limited to:







M.A.I.O.R. meets RTD’s requirements and quality standards. All of RTD’s 532 compliance matrix
requirements were accepted by the vendor.
M.A.I.O.R. has international presence with some of the largest public transit agencies. References
checked and verified.
M.A.I.O.R. included in their cost proposal, all required reporting including custom development.
M.A.I.O.R.’s product leverages automation and eliminates certain manual work-around processes
leading to more efficient internal processes
Of the six proposals received, M.A.I.O.R. offered the best architecture to meet RTD’s current and
future demands, is all inclusive of RTD’s operations (Rail and Bus), was the most flexible and
most responsive to RTD inquiries.
M.A.I.O.R has a strong and proven project implementation strategy and has successfully
deployed their Fixed Route Scheduling and Runcutting system internationally.

This new system will assure RTD’s ability to schedule services, most effectively provide for cost
saving runcutting and meet RTD’s commitment to the constituents with quality and accuracy. The
vendor’s data center is located Woodbury, New York and a fail-over site in the central United States.
The selection committee was made aware of the pending sale of M.A.I.O.R. to the American
company, Clever Devices. On June 2, 2017, RTD received confirmation the acquisition was closed
on June 1, 2017. M.A.I.O.R. is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Clever Devices.
Clever Devices is a nationally recognized company headquartered in Woodbury, New York, providing
technology solutions to public transit agencies. They provide solutions for Fixed-route, bus rapid

transit, paratransit, rail and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). RTD has used their Ridecheck
Plus ridership evaluation software since September 2004.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The M.A.I.O.R. proposal provides for System Design, Testing, Training, Integration and Implementation
for $1,847,428; First four years of Operational Services (Warranty and Hosting) for $575,699.00
($143,924.754 per year). Years five through ten Operational Service will be $200,688.00, per year and
will be budgeted for annually. Total cost of the M.A.I.O.R. proposal is $3,607,814.00. The
implementation of the Fixed Route Scheduling and Runcutting application is fully funded with existing
approved capital and operating funds and includes the first four years of warranty and hosting. The total
not to exceed contract amount is $3,607,814. Implementing a fixed route scheduling and runcutting
system to ensure RTD’s ongoing ability to conduct accurate scheduling and runcutting operations may
result in changes unforeseen at the time the Scope of Work was produced. To allow for a timely
implementation, it’s in RTD’s interest to have contract authority beyond the proposal amount by
$392,168, to allow for such events. Authority is requested from the Board for a total amount not to
exceed of $4,000,000 which includes implementation costs, annual warranty and hosting for ten years
and contingency to cover any unforeseen expenses.

ALTERNATIVES
1. RTD could choose not to implement a new Fixed Route Scheduling and Runcutting Software
Application and assume the risks and inefficiencies associated with maintaining the legacy
system.

Construction Award for RFP 16 DD - 002 Platte Bus Wash Replacement

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to award a contract to Gilmore Construction Corporation
in the amount not-to-exceed of $1,402,113 for the Platte Bus Wash Replacement project.
BACKGROUND
The Platte Maintenance and Storage Facility was constructed in 1975 and opened for operations in
December of 1976. The design capacity of the garage was based on 40-foot buses for a total of 250
buses. Currently, the facility supports 298 buses, which are made up of 28, 30, 40, 45, and 60-footlong buses.
DISCUSSION
The system is a three lane bus wash. In 2004 the system was partially rebuilt. This new project is
considered to be a full rebuild. This system has been increasingly difficult to repair as parts are becoming
more difficult to obtain. The project was advertised as an RFP. The RFP was advertised on March 6,
2017. Proposals were due on May 8, 2017. Qualifications, experience, personnel, and cost were all a
part of the award criteria. Four teams were on the proposers list but only two teams submitted.
1.

Gilmore Construction Corporation
Kubat – Wash Equipment Installer
NS Corporation – Bus Wash Equipment Designer & Supplier
ADK – Electrical Design Build Subcontractor
MSI – Mechanical / Plumbing Design-Build Subcontractor
ABO Group – Architect

2.

T-Bone Construction / Interclean Equipment, Inc.
MP Contracting – Demolition
InterClean Equipment - Bus Wash Equipment Designer & Supplier
Hodges Plumbing – Plumbing
Arrcon Electrical - Electrical

Proposals were rated in the following manner:
1. Cost – 40%
2. Key Staff and Technical Experience – 25%
3. Technical Approach – 25%
4. Technical Innovation / Creativity – 10%

Packet Pg. 94

2.12.K

Gilmore Construction Corporation cost proposal came in at $1,402,113 and T-Bone Construction /
Interclean Equipment, Inc was at $1,371,179.
The selection committee was made up three evaluators. The evaluators were Mark Golnar of the
Facilities Engineering Division, Mel Munsterman who is the Platte Maintenance Manager for Bus
Operations, and Mike Young the Platte Facilities Maintenance Supervisor. The evaluation meeting was
held on June 1, 2017. The committee’s combined evaluations clearly identified Gilmore Construction
Corporation to be the most qualified proposer. While their proposal was $30,934 more than T-Bone
Construction, their proposal strengths were their organizational structure, choice of team members, and
previous project experience with vehicle wash systems.
SBE/DBE INVOLVEMENT
There was no SBE goal set for this project.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for this contract is included in the 2017 Adopted Budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services
Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to award a
contract to Gilmore Construction Corporation in the amount not-to-exceed of $1,402,113 for the

2. Do not Accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager or his designee to
award a contract to Gilmore Construction Corporation in the amount not-to-exceed of $1,402,113
for the Platte Bus Wash Replacement project. Re-advertise the project later in the year. Readvertising could gain additional competition, but could also lose competition or have no proposers.
3. Do not Accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager or his designee to
award a contract to Gilmore Construction Corporation in the amount not-to-exceed of $1,402,113
for the Platte Bus Wash Replacement project. Cancel the project and utilize the funds to repair the
system as it breaks down. The primary reason for this project is that parts are becoming more
difficult to obtain.

Approval to enter into an IGA with the City and
County of Denver to fund improvements to the
Free MetroRide

Assistant

General

Board Meeting Date: June 27, 2017

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the Board of Directors
approve this action to enter into an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with the City and County of
Denver for up to $1,500,000 to fund the implementation of transit priority measures that will improve
the travel time and reliability of the Free MetroRide service. Funding for this IGA is included in the 2017
Adopted Budget for the Free MetroRide project.
BACKGROUND
The Free MetroRide opened in 2014 as part of the FasTracks program to complement the 16th Street
Free MallRide (mall shuttle) and improve downtown circulation for people traveling to and from
downtown Denver via transit. The Free MetroRide currently operates during the AM and PM peak
periods on 18th/19th Streets and Broadway/Lincoln between the Union Station bus concourse and Civic
Center Station. The original project included the following transit priority measures to improve reliability
of the service as compared to typical RTD bus routes operating on downtown streets during peak
periods:






Four bus bulbs/islands on 18th Street
Bus/bike/HOV lane on 19th Street during the AM peak period
Transit queue jump signal on 18th Street at Glenarm
Multiple door boarding made possible with fare-free service
Dedicated stops every 2-3 blocks

The intent was that these priority measures would result in the Free MetroRide providing faster service
between Union Station and Civic Center Station than the mall shuttle. However, that is not always the
case especially during the PM peak period when traffic is heavier. The demand for peak period
circulation will continue to grow with the opening of the remaining FasTracks rail lines.
The Free MetroRide project was completed under budget due to cost savings realized by combining the
purchase of the 60’ low-floor buses with a larger order of 60’ buses for the rest of the District. A
portion of the remaining funding was reserved in the FasTracks Annual Program Evaluation (APE) for
future investment in the project to improve operations.

Packet Pg. 96

2.13.L

RTD and Denver staff identified the following potential transit priority measures to improve operations:
1. Bus priority and queue jump traffic signals at key intersections along the route
2. Traffic signal optimization for the Free MetroRide
3. Transit-Only lane on Broadway which would also benefit other RTD routes
4. 19th Street design changes including bus bulbs and separation of the bikes from the bus lane
5. 18th Street design changes including a protected bike lane and peak period bus lane
All of the potential improvements are projects that would require changes to Denver streets and/or
traffic signals. As such, RTD and Denver staff agreed that the most efficient way to complete the work
would be for Denver to take the lead and RTD to provide the funding. This will allow the projects to be
completed without requirements such as permitting fees for street closures that would be necessary if
Denver is not the lead agency. This IGA presented for approval outlines RTD and Denver responsibilities
for the Free MetroRide improvements.
RTD will provide up to $1.5 million of funding for feasibility analysis and implementation of the
improvements. It is anticipated that the feasibility analysis will be less than 20% of the total cost,
approximately $250,000. Most of the funding will go towards implementation. However, no RTD funds
will be spent on improvements that are not feasible or that do not provide operational benefits to the
Free MetroRide. Once the IGA is completed, Denver will begin the work by conducting feasibility
analyses. The IGA provides RTD the authority to determine which improvements will move forward for
implementation with the RTD funds. It is anticipated that the feasibility analysis for the first three
improvements will take no more than 12 months and implementation will begin soon thereafter.
Improvements four and five will require more extensive feasibility study, anticipated to take 18 months.
Per the IGA, the City will invoice RTD after completion of the feasibility analysis for each improvement.
For the implementation phase, the City can either invoice RTD monthly or after completion of an
individual improvement. RTD will hold retainage until final acceptance of each improvement.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The Free MetroRide capital funding from FasTracks is as follows:





Original Capital Budget (buses and stop improvements): $16.9 million
Actual Capital Expenditures for Original 2014 Project: $11.1 million
2015 Contribution to the FISA: $2.5 million
Remaining Funding in Free MetroRide Budget: $3.3 million

This IGA commits $1.5 million of the remaining funding available in the Free MetroRide capital budget.
The decision was made in 2015 to reserve a portion of the project budget for future capital investments
to improve operations so the the remaining budget was included in the APE for the Free MetroRide as
opposed to general FasTracks. The execution of this IGA will allow a portion of those remaining funds to
be used as planned. These funds have been appropriated in the 2017 Adopted Budget for the Free
MetroRide project.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks
Committee that the Board of Directors approve this action to enter into an Intergovernmental

2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not approve the action to enter into an IGA with the
City and County of Denver and direct RTD staff to evaluate other options for completing the
planning, design and implementation of transit priority measures. This is not recommended as other
methods for implementing these projects will be more expensive and time consuming.
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not approve the action to enter into an IGA with the
City and County of Denver and do not invest capital to improve Free MetroRide operations. This is
not recommended as travel time savings and increased reliability have been identified as critical
components to ensure that the Free MetroRide achieves its goal of providing downtown passenger
circulation for patrons from across the District.
