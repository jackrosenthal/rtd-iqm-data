Special Board Meeting
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Good evening. This evening we are having a special RTD Board meeting. It
is Tuesday, June 29, 2021. And I would like to call the meeting to order as of 5:30 PM Mountain Daylight
Time. I would respectfully ask everyone to remain muted unless you are recognized to speak. And thank
you all for joining us this evening.
Please note that the official meetings of the RTD Board of Directors are being held remotely in the
interest of public health, safety, and welfare. The official meetings of the Board of Directors will be held

And a live stream of this meeting is also available via RTD's YouTube page.
I'd like to start with our civility statement. Colleagues, being elected as members of this body imposes an
ethical obligation for each of us to enhance and maintain the public confidence in this agency. As a Board
of Directors, it is our collective duty to our constituents, stakeholders, and staff to conduct our business in
an atmosphere of mutual respect, cooperation, civility, trust, and collegiality. These are the values we can
all agree upon. As such, I encourage each of us to review the operating guidelines adopted by the Board
and to act in accordance with those principles, which are available on the Board of Director's page on the
RTD website. Thank you.
Please note that we will not be taking public commentary during this meeting. Members of the public

BOBBY DISHELL: I'm here.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK. Thank you.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Thank you so much. 15 accounted for, zero absent.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: All right. We have a full group of the elected RTD Board of Directors. Thank
you all for being here.
At RTD, safety our core value and I'd like to begin this meeting with a short safety briefing. While recent
public health orders have relaxed requirements for the use of face coverings in certain settings, don't let
your guard down too soon. As a reminder, the Transit Security Administration, also known as the TSA,
has extended the federal mask requirement for public transportation until September 13, 2021. The
federal mask requirement states that individuals must wear a face covering while waiting for and while
riding public transportation, to include airports and aircraft, train stations and trains, bus stops and buses.
This evening, we have two recommended actions. And what I'd like to do now is call on our Secretary
Buzek and our GMOC Chair. Mr. Buzek, I'm going to turn the meeting over to you, sir.
VINCE BUZEK: Thanks, Madam Chair. And the two recommended action items that we have tonight
come from the GMOC and relate to the General Manager/CEO evaluation process. We had 10 of the 15
Board members present at the GMOC last week, so it'll be old news to them. Any of the people that were
not there, or anyone else that has questions or comments, we'll be happy to take them.
I'll start with the first recommended action item. And just as a way of introduction, this is another, a
second amendment to the General Manager's contract. As you recall, General Manager and CEO
Johnson's contract initially required her and us to put together an evaluation program 120 days from her
start date. We've had to extend that once, till June 30. And now because of the strategic planning process
and the evaluation process being what they are, this will not get done until next month. So we need one
more extension, and the final extension to Ms. Johnson's contract.
So the recommended action is for the Board of Directors to adopt a Second Amendment to the CEO and
GM employment agreement to extend the deadline for the Board to adopt a program by which the Board
will annually evaluate General Manager and CEO Debra Johnson's performance until no later than July
31, 2021 and to require the Board to provide Ms. Johnson with a 2021 performance evaluation no later
than December 31, 2021. Is there a motion?
SHONTEL LEWIS: So moved, Director Lewis.

KATE WILLIAMS: Second, Director Williams.
VINCE BUZEK: I have Director Lewis as the movant and Director Williams as the second. Is there any
discussion on this recommended action item?
Seeing none, are there any Board members present, who would be a no vote on this recommended
action item? Hearing none, that matter passes unanimously 15 to zero.
Move on to the second recommended action item, again related to the evaluation process. And this is
designed to give a framework to the GMOC and the Board and to our consultants to finalize the
evaluation process. Recommended action item is for the Board of Directors to adopt an appraisal
framework for evaluating the performance of General Manager and CEO Debra Johnson beginning
January 1, 2022 based upon the RTD strategic plan, to include a combined appraisal score of 50%
objective outcomes based results and 50% subjective values based results, with an opportunity for Ms.
Johnson to submit a self-evaluation to the Board. Is there a motion?
JULIEN BOUQUET: So moved, Bouquet.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: So moved.
VINCE BUZEK: I have Director Bouquet as the movant and Director, Chair Rivera-Malpiede as the
second. Is there any discussion?
PAUL ROSENTHAL: I'd like to ask a question.
VINCE BUZEK: Director Rosenthal.
PAUL ROSENTHAL: Thank you. And I think, I, first of all, have to commend everybody involved in putting
these together. There's been a lot of work and a lot of strategic planning and a lot of thought process. And
I know the General Manager and her team have really worked to a great extent on these.
My question is fairly narrow as relating to the possible self-evaluation piece of this. And it says that there's
an opportunity to provide it. What would be sort of the benefit as to opportunity to provide it versus
requiring her to provide it? I think there is value in requiring it. Or can we just hear from the General
Manager her thoughts as to saying, I will probably provide that or not provide that. I think it would just be
very helpful to get her perspective.
VINCE BUZEK: Ms. Johnson, would you like to respond?
DEBRA JOHNSON: Thank you very much, Secretary Buzek and Director Rosenthal. Yes, I will address
the question. Debra Johnson, General Manager and CEO.

I most definitely will be providing a self-evaluation, recognizing that no one knows what I do better than I
do. And so I think that would be germane to the discussion as you all look to evaluate my performance.
So thank you very kindly for the opportunity to opine.
PAUL ROSENTHAL: Yeah, I would love to see that. Thank you. I look forward to it. And thank you for
that. Appreciate that.
VINCE BUZEK: Thanks, Director Rosenthal. Any further discussion?
Seeing none, are there any Directors present who would be a no vote on this recommended action item?
Hearing none, this recommended action passes unanimously 15 to zero.
That concludes the action items. Chair Rivera-Malpiede, I will turn the meeting back over to you for items
three and four on the agenda.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, sir.
VINCE BUZEK: Oh, and thank you, everyone present for this Special Board Meeting. Really appreciate
your input and the ongoing work.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, Director Buzek. Are there any other matters to come before the
Board this evening?
OK, seeing none, I am adjourning us. Can I have a motion to adjourn?
SHONTEL LEWIS: So moved.
KATE WILLIAMS: You can.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK. So I had Lewis and Williams. Is there any no votes to adjourning?
Seeing none, it is 5:40. We are officially adjourned.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Have a great evening.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Bye.
ERIK DAVIDSON: Thanks. Have an awesome night.
BOBBY DISHELL: Bye.
DOUG TISDALE: Thanks.
