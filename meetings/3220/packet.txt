PRESENTATION LENGTH

BACKGROUND
The Board and GM and CEO Debra A. Johnson entered into an employment agreement, dated September
29, 2020, which provides that the Board, in consultation with Ms. Johnson, will adopt a program by
which the Board will annually evaluate Ms. Johnson’s performance. The evaluation must be based upon
goals and metrics established by the Board in consultation with Ms. Johnson that are directly
attributable to her performance. Incentive awards and annual increases to Ms. Johnson’s base salary are
subject to the Board’s evaluation and Ms. Johnson meeting or exceeding the performance goals.
DISCUSSION
The deadline for the Board to adopt the performance evaluation program was originally March 9, 2021.
Consistent with the anticipated RTD Strategic Plan development timeline, in February 23, 2021, the
Board adopted the First Amendment to the CEO and GM Employment Agreement, extending the deadline
to no later than June 30, 2021. The Strategic Plan development is nearing completion and a further
extension of the deadline will allow the Board and Ms. Johnson to finalize the Strategic Plan and the
goals and metrics upon which Ms. Johnson’s annual performance evaluation will be based.

There is no financial impact for this proposed amendment.

GM OVERSIGHT & PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT
BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
GM and CEO Performance Appraisal Framework

Committee Meeting Date:
June 24, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
June 29, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt an appraisal framework for evaluating the performance of General
Manager and CEO Debra A. Johnson beginning January 1, 2022 based upon the RTD Strategic Plan to
include a combined appraisal score of 50% Objective Outcomes-Based Results and 50% Subjective
Values-Based Results, with an opportunity for Ms. Johnson to submit a Self-Evaluation to the Board.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Vince Buzek, General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee (“GMOC”) Chair
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Board and GM and CEO Debra A. Johnson are currently engaged in a strategic planning process to
develop RTD’s mission, vision, values, and success outcomes, including key performance indicators. The
Strategic Plan will establish the goals and metrics the Board will use to evaluate Ms. Johnson on an
annual basis beginning in 2022.
DISCUSSION
The GMOC recommends that the Board adopt a performance appraisal framework based upon the
Strategic Plan whereby 50% of the appraisal score is for Objective Outcomes-Based Results (tied to
Success Outcomes and Key Performance Indicators) and 50% of the score is for Subjective ValuesBased Results. Ms. Johnson would have the opportunity to submit a Self-Evaluation to the Board.
The GMOC anticipates bringing another proposed recommended action to the full Board to address the
specifics of the performance appraisal process and compensation performance incentives for adoption no
later than July 30, 2021.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact for this recommended action.
