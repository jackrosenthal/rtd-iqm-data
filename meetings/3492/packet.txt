BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Certificates of Participation, Series 2013A Refunding

July 11, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
July 25, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt the attached Resolution Number ____ (the “COP Resolution”), Series
of 2023 authorizing the refinancing of Certificate of Participation (COP) Series 2013A for interest
savings.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Brenden Morgan, Senior Manager, Debt and Investments
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD primarily utilizes sales tax bonds and certificates of participation (COPs), when necessary, as
financing mechanisms to provide funding for certain purchases of assets with useful lives in excess of
one year. Sales tax bonds are subject to Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TABOR) limitations and debt service
payments are secured by future collections of sales and use taxes. COPs are lease-purchase
arrangements and are not subject to TABOR limitations; however, COPs require annual appropriation by
the Board through the budgeting process to authorize annual principal and interest payments. COPs are
secured through the collateralization of the essential assets of the district. Bonds and COPs are referred
to as RTD debt for discussion purposes.
All of RTD’s debt has fixed interest rates, meaning that the interest rate paid on the portfolio of debt
does not vary with market changes. In addition, RTD’s debt has fixed terms of maturity and is not
subject to acceleration, meaning that all debt payments will occur on a fixed schedule through the term
of each obligation. These features provide budget certainty as well as limit RTD’s interest rate risk.
RTD’s debt portfolio contains obligations that are either taxable or tax-exempt. Taxable debt results in
interest payments to debt holders being subject to income tax while tax-exempt debt is generally nontaxable. Taxable debt generally has a higher cost to RTD than tax-exempt debt due to the difference in
interest rates at the time of issuance. Taxable debt is issued instead of tax-exempt debt in situations
that are advantageous to RTD but do not meet the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requirements to be
issued as tax-exempt.
As of December 31, 2022, RTD’s total outstanding bonds and COPs totaled $2.815 billion.

DISCUSSION
RTD and its Municipal Advisor, Hilltop Securities, constantly monitor market conditions for opportunities
for efficiencies regarding RTD’s finances. Current market conditions for debt have created opportunities
to take advantage of low interest rates.
The attached Resolution allows the issuance of Certificates of Participation, Series 2023, for debt
service savings. The related contractual documents required to effectuate the refundings are identified in
the Resolution and include:
• The Preliminary Official Statement
• The Lease
• The Trust Indenture
• The Continuing Disclosure Agreement
• The Certificate Purchase Agreement
Substantially final drafts of the contractual documents are on file and available for review on the RTD
Investor Information webpage under the “Documents for Potential Bond Refunding”. The Investor
Information

Resolution No. ___ delegates to the General Manager and CEO or the Chief Financial Officer the authority
(effective for one year following the date thereof) to determine terms of the Series 2023A refunding
certificates of participation, provided that:
1. The aggregate principal amount of the Base Rentals payable by the District pursuant to the Lease
authorized hereunder shall not exceed $51,000,000
2. The maximum aggregate annual amount of Base Rentals payable by the District pursuant to the
Lease authorized hereunder in any Fiscal Year shall not exceed $19,000,000
3. The Lease Term for the Lease shall not extend beyond June 1, 2027, or the average useful life of
the Leased Property related to the Lease, whichever is shorter
4. The maximum net effective interest rate on the interest component of the Base Rentals relating to
the 2023 Certificates shall not exceed 5.00%
5. The present value savings related to the Refunding Project shall not be less than 1.50% of the
principal amount of the 2013A Certificates being refunded
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Two potential benefits of the recommended COPs refunding transaction that will contribute to the
Strategic Priority of Financial Success are:
1. Refinancing COPs Series 2013A will yield potential gross debt service savings of $28.2 million or
a net present value of $1.7 million or 2.5%
2. Using existing COPs Series 2013A debt service reserve fund will reduce outstanding debt by
approximately $23.4 million

directed to execute and deliver for and on behalf of the District any and all additional certificates,
documents and other papers, and to perform all other acts that they may deem necessary or

In the event the Chair, the First Vice Chair, the Secretary, the General Manager, the

Section 7.
No General Obligation Debt. No provision of this Resolution, the
Lease, the Indenture or the 2023 Certificates shall be construed as creating or constituting a general
obligation or other indebtedness or multiple fiscal year financial obligation of the District within
the meaning of any constitutional or statutory provision, nor a mandatory charge or requirement
against the District in any ensuing fiscal year beyond the then current fiscal year. The District
shall have no obligation to make any payment with respect to the 2023 Certificates except in
connection with the payment of the Base Rentals (as defined in the Lease) and certain other
payments under the Lease, which payments may be terminated by the District in accordance with

the provisions of the Lease. Neither the Lease nor the 2023 Certificates shall constitute a
mandatory charge or requirement of the District in any ensuing fiscal year beyond the then current
fiscal year or constitute or give rise to a general obligation or other indebtedness or multiple fiscal
year financial obligation of the District within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory debt
limitation and shall not constitute a multiple fiscal year direct or indirect District debt or other
financial obligation whatsoever. No provision of the Lease or the 2023 Certificates shall be
construed or interpreted as creating an unlawful delegation of governmental powers nor as a
donation by or a lending of the credit of the District within the meaning of Sections 1 or 2 of Article
XI of the Colorado Constitution. Neither the Lease nor the 2023 Certificates shall directly or
indirectly obligate the District to make any payments beyond those budgeted and appropriated for
the District's then current fiscal year.
Section 8.
Reasonableness of Rentals. The Board hereby determines and
declares that the Base Rentals due under the Lease, in the maximum amounts authorized pursuant
to Section 3 hereof, constitute the fair rental value of the 2023 Leased Property and do not exceed
a reasonable amount so as to place the District under an economic compulsion to renew the Lease
or to exercise its option to purchase the 2023 Leased Property pursuant to the Lease. The Board
hereby determines and declares that the period during which the District has an option to purchase
the 2023 Leased Property (i.e., the entire maximum term of the Lease) does not exceed the useful
life of the 2023 Leased Property.
Section 9.
Exercise of Option; Direction to Trustee. In the event that the
General Manager or the Chief Financial Officer determines to proceed with the Refunding Project
and executes a Sale Certificate in accordance with the provisions set forth herein, the Board hereby
elects and hereby declares its intent to exercise on the behalf and in the name of the District its
option to purchase all of the 2013A Leased Property currently encumbered under the 2013A
Indenture and to redeem all of the outstanding 2013A Certificates (the "Refunded Certificates"),
as applicable, on the redemption date and at the redemption prices set forth in the Sale Certificate
related to the Refunding Project. Upon the execution of the Sale Certificate related to the
Refunding Project, the District hereby irrevocably instructs the Trustee to give notice of refunding
and defeasance to the Owners of the Refunded Certificates in accordance with the provisions of
the Sale Certificate, the Indenture of Trust related to the Refunded Certificates and the Escrow
Agreement between the Corporation and the Trustee, as escrow agent.
Section 10.
No Recourse against Officers and Agents. Pursuant to Section 1157-209 of the Supplemental Act, if a member of the Board, or any officer or agent of the District
acts in good faith, no civil recourse shall be available against such member, officer, or agent for
payment of the principal, interest or prior redemption premiums on the 2023 Certificates. Such
recourse shall not be available either directly or indirectly through the Board or the District, or
otherwise, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute, rule of law, enforcement of penalty, or
otherwise. By the acceptance of the 2023 Certificates and as a part of the consideration of their
sale or purchase, any person purchasing or selling such certificate specifically waives any such
recourse.

Repealer. All bylaws, orders and resolutions of the District, or parts
thereof, inconsistent with this Resolution or with any of the documents hereby approved are hereby

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
FasTracks Bonds, Series 2019A & 2021A Refunding

July 11, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
July 25, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Bond Resolution”),
Series of 2023 authorizing the refunding of and tender offer for FasTracks Sales Tax Bonds Series
2019A and 2021A for debt service savings.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Brenden Morgan, Senior Manager, Debt and Investments
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD primarily utilizes sales tax bonds and certificates of participation (COPs), when necessary, as
financing mechanisms to provide funding for certain purchases of assets with useful lives in excess of
one year. Sales tax bonds are subject to Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TABOR) limitations and debt service
payments are secured by future collections of sales and use taxes. COPs are lease-purchase
arrangements and are not subject to TABOR limitations; however, COPs require annual appropriation by
the Board through the budgeting process to authorize annual principal and interest payments. COPs are
secured through the collateralization of the underlying asset that was financed. Bonds and COPs are
referred to as RTD debt for discussion purposes.
All of RTD’s debt has fixed interest rates, meaning that the interest rate paid on the portfolio of debt
does not vary with market changes. In addition, RTD’s debt has fixed terms of maturity and is not
subject to acceleration, meaning that all debt payments will occur on a fixed schedule through the term
of each obligation. These features provide budget certainty as well as limit RTD’s interest rate risk.
RTD’s debt portfolio contains obligations that are either taxable or tax-exempt. Taxable debt results in
interest payments to debt holders being subject to taxable income while tax-exempt debt is generally
non-taxable. Taxable debt generally has a higher cost to RTD than tax-exempt debt due to the difference
in interest rates at the time of issuance. Taxable debt is issued instead of tax-exempt debt in situations
that are advantageous to RTD but do not meet the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requirements to be
issued as tax-exempt.
As of December 31, 2022, RTD’s total outstanding bonds and COPs totaled $2.815 billion.

DISCUSSION
RTD and its Municipal Advisor, Hilltop Securities, constantly monitor market conditions for opportunities
for efficiencies regarding RTD’s finances. Current market conditions for debt indicate opportunities to
take advantage of current bond market conditions and differences between taxable and tax-exempt
interest rates.
The attached Resolution allows the issuance of Sales Tax Revenue Refunding Bonds (FasTracks Project),
Series 2023 for debt service savings. The related contractual documents required to effectuate the
refundings are identified in the Resolution and include:
Invitation to Tender Bonds
The Preliminary Official Statement
The Trust Indenture
The Continuing Disclosure Agreement
The Escrow Agreement
The Bond Purchase Agreement
The Dealer Management Agreement
Substantially final drafts of the contractual documents are on file and available for review on the RTD
Investor Information webpage under the “Documents for Potential Bond Refunding”. The Investor
Information webpage can be found at the following link: https://www.rtd-denver.com/services/financialsinvestors
Resolution No. ___ delegates to the General Manager and CEO or the Chief Financial Officer the authority
(effective for one year following the date thereof) to prepare or cause to be prepared the 2023 Tender
Offer to all or a portion of the holders of the outstanding 2019A Bonds and the 2021A Bonds and all
related offer materials upon the terms and conditions determined to be in the best interests of the
District and to determine terms of the Series 2021A refunding bonds, provided that:
1. The final maturity of the Bonds shall be no later than November 1, 2038
2. The net effective interest rate of the Bonds shall be less than the combined net effective interest
rate of the Refunded 2019A/2021A Bonds and any Purchased 2019A/2021A Bonds purchased
with proceeds of the Bonds
3. The combined maximum annual repayment cost of the Bonds and all other outstanding debt
issued pursuant to the 2004 Election shall not exceed the maximum annual repayment cost
authorized in the notice of election sent to the voters in connection with the 2004 Election
4. The combined debt service requirements of the Bonds and all other outstanding debt issued
pursuant to the 2004 Election, when combined with the debt service requirements previously
paid for all other debt issued pursuant to the 2004 Election, shall not exceed the maximum total
repayment cost authorized at the 2004 Election
5. The net purchase price of the Bonds shall not be less than 98% of the original principal amount of
the Bonds

Packet Pg. 25

1.D.2

6. The net present value savings of the Purchased 2019A/2021A Bonds shall not be less than
3.00% of the aggregate principal amount of the Purchased 2019A/2021A Bonds, and the net
present value savings of the Refunded 2019A/2021A Bonds shall be (i) greater than zero in the
case of the Refunded 2019A/2021A Bonds which mature on or prior to November 1, 2031 and
(ii) not less than 3.00% of the aggregate principal amount of the Refunded 2019A/2021A Bonds
in the case of the Refunded 2019A/2021A Bonds which mature after November 1, 2031
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Execution of this refunding transaction through the use of a tender offer will contribute to the Strategic
Priority of Financial Success.
Based on recent market conditions, the Sales Tax Revenue Refunding Bond, Series 2023A transaction
could generate gross debt service savings of $10.8 million or a net present value of $7.4 million or
4.9%.
If approved by the Board, RTD would solicit current bond holders to sell their bonds to RTD with RTD
having the option to cancel the transaction if an adequate level of participation does not occur. Parties
to this transaction are working on a contingent fee basis, which would result in little to no cost to RTD if
the transaction is canceled.

1.D.2.a

WHEREAS, subject to certain conditions set forth in the Outstanding Parity Bond
Indentures, the District is authorized to issue Additional Parity Bonds (as defined in the
Outstanding Parity Bond Indentures) which have a lien on all or a portion of the Pledged Revenues
(as defined therein) that is on a parity with the lien thereon of the Outstanding Parity Bonds; and
WHEREAS, the Board has determined and hereby determines that with respect to
the Bonds herein authorized, the conditions set forth in the Outstanding Parity Bond Indentures
for the issuance of Additional Parity Bonds have been satisfied (or will be satisfied on or prior to
the delivery of the Bonds) and accordingly, the Board has determined and hereby determines that
the Bonds will be issued with a first lien (but not necessarily an exclusive first lien) on the 0.4%
Sales Tax Increase that is on a parity with the Outstanding Parity Bonds; and
WHEREAS, the District has previously entered into a Concession and Lease
Agreement (the "Concession Agreement") with Denver Transit Partners LLC ("Denver Transit
Partners"), pursuant to which the District has agreed to make monthly service payments to Denver
Transit Partners upon the commencement of revenue service of the Eagle P3 Project, and pursuant
to the authority conferred at the 2004 Election, the District has pledged the RTD Pledged Revenues
(as defined in the Concession Agreement) to make a portion of such service payments (the
"TABOR Portion") on a subordinate basis to the Senior Debt, the Outstanding Parity Bonds, and
the Bonds; and
WHEREAS, subject to certain conditions set forth in the Concession Agreement,
the District is authorized to issue bonds with a lien on the RTD Pledged Revenues which is senior
and superior to the pledge and lien thereon of the TABOR Portion; and
WHEREAS, the Board has determined and hereby determines that with respect to
the Bonds herein authorized, the conditions set forth in the Concession Agreement for the issuance
of the Bonds with a lien on the RTD Pledged Revenues which is senior and superior to the pledge
and lien thereon of the TABOR Portion have been satisfied (or will be satisfied prior to the delivery
of the Bonds) and accordingly, the Board has determined and hereby determines that the Bonds
shall be issued with a lien on the RTD Pledged Revenues which is senior and superior to the pledge
and lien thereon of the TABOR Portion; and
WHEREAS, accordingly, the Board has determined and hereby determines that to
the extent that the Bonds are issued and the 2023 Refunding Project is effectuated, the Bonds shall
be issued with (a) a lien on the Pledged Income which is in all respects subordinate to the pledge
and lien thereon of the Senior Debt, but which is on a parity with the pledge and lien thereon of
the Outstanding Parity Bonds; (b) a first lien (but not necessarily an exclusive first lien) on the
0.4% Sales Tax Increase that is on a parity with the Outstanding Parity Bonds; and (c) a lien on
the RTD Pledged Revenues (as defined in the Outstanding Parity Bond Indentures) which is senior
and superior to the pledge and lien thereon of the TABOR Portion; and

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Title VI Fare Equity Analysis

July 11, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
July 25, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt the Title VI Fare Equity Analysis report for the Systemwide Fare
Study and Equity Analysis recommended fare changes to comply with federal laws, regulations and
guidelines related to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VI).
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Carl Green Jr., Director, Civil Rights
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI. In this circular, the FTA requires RTD
to evaluate fare changes, prior to implementation, to determine whether those changes will have a
disproportionately negative impact on minority or low-income populations. The FTA defines a fare
change as an increase in the price of fare media, decrease in the price of fare media, creation of new
fare media or the discontinuance of current fare media. Fare media are defined as forms of payment for
transit service (i.e., cash fare, paper pass, etc.). The Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis
includes proposed fare changes that meet this definition. Thus, an analysis is required to be brought
before the Board for approval. The complete Title VI Fare Equity Analysis report is included in
Attachment A.
RTD’s Title VI Fare Equity Analysis Policies
Pursuant to FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Disparate Impact Policy and a
Disproportionate Burden Policy. On May 24, 2022, the Board approved and adopted the Title VI Program
Update and required policies. Collectively, these policies provide foundational requirements for evaluating
fare change proposals for equity and compliance with Title VI. These policies and their applicable
thresholds are defined and illustrated as follows:
Disparate Impact Analysis
A disparate impact analysis is a review of the difference in the adverse effects absorbed by minority
persons as a result of any fare price change or the average of multiple fare changes, which difference
shall not be greater than or less than 5% of impacts absorbed by the overall ridership. “Minority” is
defined as all persons who identify as being part of racial/ethnic groups besides white, non-Hispanic.

Packet Pg. 49

1.D.3

Disproportionate Burden Analysis
A disproportionate burden analysis is an examination of the difference in the adverse effects absorbed
by low-income persons as a result of any fare price change or the average of multiple fare changes,
which difference shall not be greater than or less than 5% of impacts absorbed by the overall ridership.
A low-income population is a group of households who are at or below 150 percent of the United States
Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.
If a proposed fare change results in a disparate impact or a disproportionate burden, RTD will consider
modifying the proposal to avoid, minimize, or mitigate potential adverse effects. The agency will then
analyze the modification and make sure it removed the potential disparate impact or disproportionate
burden. If a less discriminatory option cannot be identified and RTD can demonstrate a substantial
legitimate justification for the proposed fare change, the FTA may allow RTD to proceed with the
proposed change.
DISCUSSION
In adopting this recommended action, the agency seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan priorities
of Community Value and Customer Excellence.
Staff presented the draft recommendation for fare structure changes and the draft Title VI fare equity
analysis at the April 11, 2023, Finance and Planning Committee meeting (see attached Board materials).
Subsequently, staff released the draft fare equity analysis to the public for comment in tandem with the
draft recommendation release. There were no associated changes made to the draft recommendation
following the final public comment period.
The following discussion is divided into two sections:
• Final draft Title VI fare equity analysis of proposed fare changes
• Final public outreach and engagement efforts
Title VI Fare Equity Analysis of Proposed Fare Changes
In accordance with Title VI and FTA Circular 4702.1B, RTD conducted an equity analysis of the
proposed fare changes to ensure that they do not unfairly impact people of color and low-income
populations. The changes proposed as part the Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis, include a
fare restructuring and price reduction, establishment of a Transit Assistance Grant Program, introduction
of a Bulk Purchase Program, establishment of a Semester Pass Program, introduction of fare capping and
expansion of eligibility for RTD’s low-income fare discount program (LiVE).
The analysis does not consider fare changes to Access-a-Ride services, which provide complementary
paratransit services within the RTD service area, as they are not subject to the current Title VI
evaluation requirements. The introduction of expanded retail opportunities for the MyRide fare collection
system beyond the four RTD Sales Outlets is not included in this analysis as RTD is still in the process of
procuring retail expansion opportunities. The introduction of a substantially expanded set of retail
opportunities would require a future Title VI review.

Packet Pg. 50

1.D.3

Lastly, this analysis does not include the Zero Fare for Youth pilot program. Per the FTA, promotional
fare reductions or pilots are excluded from being subject to a fare equity analysis if the pilot does not
last longer than six months. On June 22, 2023, FTA officials approved RTD’s request to extend the pilot
beyond the six-month period permitted under current federal regulation to a 12-month period, through
the end of the 2023-2024 school year and concluding August 31, 2024. If Zero Fare for Youth is sought
to be made permanent beyond the pilot period, a fare equity analysis is required to be completed prior to
the permanent fare change and will need Board approval.
Methodology:
For proposed changes that would increase or decrease the fares on the entire system, on certain transit
modes, or by fare payment type or fare media, RTD shall analyze any available information generated
from passenger surveys indicating whether minority and/or low-income customers are disproportionately
more likely to use the mode of service, payment type or payment media that would be subject to the
fare change.
Based on the Federal Guidance and the RTD Title VI Policies, RTD shall:
i.
Determine the number and percent of users of each fare media being changed;
ii.
Review fares before the change and after the change;
iii.
Compare the differences for each particular fare media between minority users and all users; and
iv.
Compare the differences for each particular fare media between low-income users and all users.
A fare equity analysis compares the current fare to the proposed fare and calculates the absolute change
as well as the percent change. Utilizing the Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden threshold, a
determination is made as to whether the fare change will result in adverse effects that are
disproportionately borne by the minority or low-income populations, respectively. The thresholds are also
used to assess whether the proposed changes disproportionately benefit the overall population, including
non-minority or non-low-income populations.
Summary of Findings:
• Disparate Impact Analysis – the analysis found that minority customers are expected to
experience a slightly smaller average fare decrease compared to all customers. While both groups
experience a decrease in their average fare, all customers are expected to benefit somewhat more
than minority customers as a result of the proposed fare changes. However, the fare changes do
not represent a disparate impact on minority customers as the percentage point difference in
percentage change in average fare from the proposed fare changes does not exceed RTD’s 5%
threshold. Therefore, the proposed fare changes do not present a disparate impact.
•

Disproportionate Burden Analysis – the analysis found that low-income customers are expected
to experience a slightly smaller average fare decrease compared to all customers. While both
groups experience a decrease in their average fare, all customers are expected to benefit
somewhat more than low-income customers as a result of the proposed fare changes. However,
the fare changes do not represent a disproportionate burden on low-income customers as the
percentage point difference in percentage change in average fare from the proposed fare changes

does not exceed RTD’s 5% threshold. Therefore, the proposed fare changes do not present a
disproportionate burden.
Conclusions:
The average fare analysis uncovered no Title VI equity concerns using RTD’s Board-adopted Title VI
Policies. While changes to some fare payment types would result in a greater percentage change for
some populations, the aggregate, systemwide differences between all customers and minority customers
and between all customers and low-income customers were within the 5% policy threshold. The
proposed fare changes are expected to benefit minority customers and low-income customers to a lesser
degree than all customers, but the difference in benefits does not exceed 5% on a systemwide basis. As
such, no mitigations are recommended to proceed with the implementation of the proposed fare changes
based on the average fare analysis.
Although there were no disparate impacts or disproportionate burdens identified in the Title VI fare
equity analysis, RTD has integrated equity focused improvements and targeted programs benefitting
minority and low-income populations as part of the draft recommendation. This includes LiVE expansion,
Transit Assistance Grant program, Semester Pass opt-in program for post-secondary educational
institutions and the zero fare for youth pilot. Additionally, RTD has planned efforts to expand access to
MyRide retail opportunities as well as increase outreach activities to promote the LiVE Program through
partnerships with community-based organizations.
Final Public Outreach and Engagement Efforts
Pursuant to FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter III.5-6, RTD must promote inclusive public participation,
provide meaningful access to limited English proficient persons, and perform appropriate methods to
facilitate the public comment and community engagement process. The final public engagement
activities and public hearings comport with the federal guidelines and are illustrated in Section 7 of the
Title VI Fare Equity Analysis Report.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The adoption of the Title VI Fare Equity Analysis will not result in any direct or foreseeable financial
impacts.

Final Draft Title VI Fare Equity Analysis

July 11, 2023

Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (“Title VI”) ensures that “no person in the United States shall, on the basis
of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to
discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” The Regional Transportation
District (“RTD” or “The District”) has committed to the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) Title VI objectives set
forth in Circular 4702.1B, ensuring that FTA-assisted benefits and related services are made available and are
equitably distributed without regard to race, color or national origin.
This analysis of the fare changes proposed as part the recent Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis that
includes a fare restructuring and price reduction, introduction of fare capping and expansion of eligibility for RTD’s
low-income fare discount program (“LiVE”) was prepared in conformity with the guidelines laid out in Chapter IV
and Appendix K of FTA Circular 4702.1B, Service and Fare Equity Analysis Questionnaire Checklist.
The Fare Equity Analysis described herein assesses whether the proposed fare changes for fixed-route services
would result in either Disparate Impacts on minority customers or a Disproportionate Burden on low-income
customers. The proposed fare changes being presented by RTD are the basis of this Fare Equity Analysis. The
analysis does not consider fare changes to Access-a-Ride services, which provide complementary paratransit
services within the RTD service area, as they are not subject to the current Title VI evaluation requirements.
The Average Fare Analysis conducted as part of this Fare Equity Analysis found that the proposed fare changes
would not result in a Disparate Impact on minority customers or Disproportionate Burden on low-income
customers. Given that there were no findings of Disparate Impact or Disproportionate Burden, no mitigations are
needed to proceed with the implementation of the proposed fare changes.

1.D.3.b
Final Draft Title VI Fare Equity Analysis

July 11, 2023

In 2021, the Regional Transportation District (RTD) initiated the Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis (the
study) in response to feedback from customers and stakeholders that RTD fares are expensive and difficult to
understand. To address those issues, RTD launched the study to examine its fares holistically, taking into
consideration the three study goals of equity, affordability and simplicity. These goals have provided direction for
the overall study, guided the development and evaluation of alternatives and will be used to determine success.
RTD has taken a customer-centric approach to the study, with opportunities for customers as well as stakeholders
and community members to help shape the direction of the study. The study has included three distinct phases
of engagement to gather customer and community input and share updates on progress. The first phase, held in
spring 2022, was undertaken to identify challenges with the current fare system and to receive input on fare
structure preferences. The second phase, held in summer 2022, provided an overview of the customer and
stakeholder feedback heard during the first phase, as well as the conceptual fare options that were under
consideration and in the process for evaluating them. Phase 3 was conducted in fall 2022 to receive feedback on
the two fare structure alternatives that were developed and being considered. Final public engagement and public
hearings will be held between April 2023 and June 2023.
All of the engagement phases included customer and community meetings, three feedback panels aimed at larger
groups of constituents, focus groups with community-based organizations and a number of other methods of
providing feedback including two online surveys, a study website and social media posts. To ensure a communitydriven process, the study focused on Title VI and historically underrepresented populations. Partnerships were
formed with six community-based organizations to assist in reaching their respective clients, and included specific
focus groups with their clients.
The proposed alternative was developed based on feedback received on the two fare structure alternatives in the
third phase. The proposed fare changes include a number of structural and pricing changes to RTD’s fares, as well
as changes to current pass programs, new pass programs and technological changes to fare payment, including
the introduction of fare capping. The proposed alternative does not include changes that were implemented prior
to July 2022 and examined under a separate Fare Equity Analysis. Tables 1-4 summarize the proposed fare
changes, which include fare structure and pricing changes, LiVE Program changes, pass program changes, and
implementation of a Transit Assistance Grant Program and a College Semester Pass. More information about the
proposed fare changes is found in Section 6.

Elimination

● Lowered 3-Hour, Day Pass and Monthly Pass pricing.

● Simplified fare structure by removing the Regional fare
category. Customers would pay a flat fare for all travel
except for trips originating or ending at Denver
International Airport.

● Introduction of daily (service day) and monthly
(calendar) fare capping for full fare customers, seniors,
individuals with disabilities, LiVE customers and youth
using MyRide stored value with MyRide Barcode in the
MyRide App or a new MyRide Smart Card.
● Lowered Monthly Pass price, with the breakeven
multiple for the full fare Monthly Pass reduced from 38
times the price of a 3-Hour Pass to 32 times the price
of a 3-Hour Pass, resulting in an $88.00 Monthly Pass
and monthly fare cap.
● One Monthly Pass price for customers paying
discounted fares with an increased discount on the
Monthly Pass to 70%, effectively lowering the
breakeven multiple for Monthly Pass and monthly fare
cap for seniors, individuals with disabilities, Medicare
recipients and LiVE customers to 20 times the 3-Hour
Pass price ($27.00).

● For customers paying discounted fares, a single price
fare level for all travel, including trips originating or
ending at Denver International Airport.
● Elimination of the discount on 10-Ride Ticket Books for
full fare customers, seniors, individuals with disabilities
and Medicare recipients. Existing LiVE and youth 10Ride Ticket Books do not include a discount, so no
changes are proposed to these customers’ 10-Ride
Ticket Books.
● Elimination of mobile 10-Ride Ticket Books.

● One Monthly Pass valid for travel anywhere in the
service area including the Airport; no higher price pass
required for Regional and Airport customers. For
customers using fare capping through MyRide Barcode
in the MyRide App or MyRide Smart Card, Local and
Airport fares paid will contribute towards the $88.00
calendar monthly fare cap.

3 Title VI Policies
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Section 601 states:

It is RTD’s objective to avoid, minimize or mitigate disproportionately high and adverse impacts on minority and
low-income populations. As a recipient of financial assistance from the FTA, RTD is required to comply with Title
VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and its own Title VI Program adopted in accordance with same by evaluating
major service and fare changes at the planning and programming stages to determine whether those changes
have discriminatory impacts, including Disparate Impacts on minority populations and/or Disproportionate
Burdens on low-income populations.
According to the Federal Department of Transportation, equity in the provision of transit service is "providing
equal levels of service to minority and non-minority residents of the urbanized area. Levels of service, in turn, are
defined in terms of capital allocation and accessibility." 1 The metrics of discrimination that could be monitored
for disparate treatment include fare structures that could consistently cause minority-group customers to bear a
higher fare burden than the overall riding public, access to specialized fare media, or methods of communication
to populations with Limited English Proficiency. However, a Title VI Equity Analysis should not replace good
program planning, which should be an on-going process that considers equity among other factors when designing
fare changes, service changes, or discretionary policies and programs.
Per FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Disparate Impact Policy and a Disproportionate
Burden Policy for evaluating fare change proposals for equity and compliance with Title VI. As part of the 2022
Title VI Program Update, RTD maintained their 5% threshold for determining a Disparate Impact or
Disproportionate Burden of a fare modification as established in RTD’s Fare Disparate Impact Policy and
Disproportionate Burden Policy. The Board of Directors adopted the Title VI Policies concurrent with the adoption
of their 2022 Title VI Program Update. The policies used by RTD for analysis of proposed fare changes is found in
Section 3.1.

3.1 Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden Policies
The FTA requires that transit agencies assess whether a proposed fare change or major service change would have
a “Disparate Impact” on minority populations, or “Disproportionate Burden” on low-income populations, under
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title 49 C.F.R. Section 21.5(b)(2) and (b)(7), and Appendix C to Title 49 C.F.R.
part 21. Pursuant to FTA Circular 4702.1B, FTA requires public transit agencies operating 50 or more fixed route
vehicles in peak service and located in urbanized areas of 200,000 or more people, to clearly establish, with input
through a public engagement process, threshold definitions for measuring Disparate Impacts and
Disproportionate Burdens.

July 11, 2023

RTD’s Fare Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden policies establish threshold standards for evaluating
the equity impacts and the distribution of adverse effects caused by any fare change or major service change.
These thresholds enable RTD to determine whether minority and low-income customers would be
disproportionately impacted by the adverse effects of the proposed changes and by inference, whether the overall
ridership would disproportionately benefit from the proposed changes when compared to the protected
populations (minority and low-income). These thresholds are based on the cumulative impact of the proposed
service or fare change.
The policies and their applicable analyses and thresholds are defined and illustrated as follows:
●

Disparate Impact Analysis
A disparate impact analysis is a review of the difference in the adverse effects absorbed by minority
persons as a result of any fare price change or the average of multiple fare changes, which shall not be
greater than or less than 5% of impacts absorbed by the overall ridership. “Minority” is defined as all
persons who identify as being part of racial/ethnic groups besides white, non-Hispanic.

●

Disproportionate Burden
A disproportionate burden analysis is defined as an examination of the difference in the adverse effects
absorbed by low-income persons as a result of any fare price change or the average of multiple fare
changes, which shall not be greater than or less than 5% of impacts absorbed by the overall ridership. A
low-income population is a group of households who are at or below 150 percent of the Department of
Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.

3.1.1 Fare Changes
RTD defines a fare change as an increase in the price of fare media, decrease in the price of fare media, creation
of new fare media or the discontinuance of current fare media. Fare Media are defined as forms of payment for
transit service (i.e., cash fare, paper pass, etc.).
Based on federal guidance, prior to adopting a fare change, RTD must conduct a fare equity analysis and analyze
specific elements of the proposed structure and changes to fare media along with the recommended pricing
schema, to determine whether the changes would result in impacts that exceed the threshold established by the
policies. As referenced in C4702.1B, some fare changes are excluded from being the subject of a Fare Equity
Analysis, such as instances where all passengers ride free such as “Spare the Air Days”, or temporary fare
reductions that are mitigating measures for other activities such as construction, or promotional fare reductions,
so long as the temporary fare reduction or promotional reduction does not last longer than six months.

3.1.2 Adverse Effects
For the fare equity analysis, adverse effects include an increase in cost or a reduction in accessibility of fare media.
Benefits include a decrease in cost, increase in discounts for certain fare types or customer populations, or
increase in accessibility of fare media. The results of analysis provided in this report uses RTD’s adopted thresholds
for determining Disparate Impacts and Disproportionate Burdens.

4 Fare Equity Analysis Methodology

The typical measure of Disparate Impact or Disproportionate Burden involves a comparison between the
proportion of persons in the protected class (i.e., minority or low-income populations) who are adversely affected
by the service or fare change and the proportion of persons not in the protected class (i.e., non-minority or nonlow-income) who are adversely affected.2 In accordance with RTD Title VI Policies, the determination of a Fare
Disparate Impact or Disproportionate Burden is based on the difference in the impacts experienced by minority
and low-income persons as a result of any fare price change or the average of multiple fare changes compared to
the impacts experienced by the overall ridership.
Based on the Federal Guidance and the RTD Title VI Policies, RTD shall:
(i) Determine the number and percent of users of each fare media being changed;
(ii) Review fares before the change and after the change;
(iii) Compare the differences for each particular fare media between minority users and all users; and
(iv) Compare the differences for each particular fare media between low-income users and all users. 3
A fare equity analysis compares the current fare to the proposed fare and calculates the absolute change as well
as the percent change. Utilizing the Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden threshold, a determination is
made as to whether the fare change will result in adverse effects that are disproportionately borne by the minority
or low-income populations, respectively. The thresholds are also used to assess whether the proposed changes
disproportionately benefit the overall population, including non-minority or non-low-income populations.
Throughout the document, the following definitions are used:
●
●

●

Fare payment type is defined as fare product (e.g., Day Pass, Monthly Pass) and fare media on which it is
distributed (i.e., cash, paper, electronic)
Fare levels include Local, Regional and Airport. Whether the Local or Regional fare level applies is based
on the number of zones traveled on rail and distance traveled on bus. The Airport fare level applies to any
trip to or from Denver International Airport, regardless of distance, on the A Line, SkyRide or Express bus.
Fare-paying rider categories include full fare customers, seniors 65+, individuals with disabilities, Medicare
recipients, LiVE customers and youth aged 19 and younger.

This report provides the results of the Average Fare Analysis undertaken to assess the effects of the proposed
fare changes on the average fare paid per boarding to determine whether minority or low-income customers are
disproportionately adversely impacted by the changes or whether overall customers disproportionately benefit
from the changes.

For proposed changes that would increase or decrease the fares on the entire system, or on certain transit modes,
or by fare payment type or fare media, RTD shall analyze any available information generated from passenger
surveys indicating whether minority and/or low-income customers are disproportionately more likely to use the
mode of service, payment type or payment media that would be subject to the fare change.

1.D.3.b
Final Draft Title VI Fare Equity Analysis

July 11, 2023

The Average Fare Analysis for the proposed changes was undertaken using ticket sales and revenue data from
calendar year 2021, when ridership was continuing to recover from the COVID pandemic. Ridership by fare
payment type was estimated based on ticket sales and revenue data as well as transfer and fare product usage
rates developed using the 2017 RTD Customer Satisfaction Survey (2017 CSS). 2021 ticket sales data were used to
determine electronic fare adoption for 3-Hour and Day Pass customers in order to assess the impacts of the
introduction of fare capping on the average fare for overall, minority and low-income customers. 2017 CSS
demographic data combined with 2021 ticket sales data were used to estimate the potential increase in LiVE
ridership due to the income eligibility expansion for the LiVE Program.
The Average Fare Analysis excludes free rides as ridership data for free rides are not available. Free rides include
Access-a-Ride customers on fixed-route and FlexRide services, children ages 5 and younger traveling with a farepaying adult, active duty members of the U.S. military and other customers on the RTD fare exemption list. The
Average Fare Analysis also excludes free rides taken on the MallRide. Further, this Fare Equity Analysis does not
consider the impacts of the proposed changes to Access-A-Ride fares on the average fare paid as paratransit
services are not subject to the current Title VI evaluation requirements.
The 2019 RTD Customer Satisfaction Survey (2019 CSS) was used for the customer demographic data. While the
2019 CSS sample size was smaller than the 2017 CSS, it provides demographic data on electronic fare adoption,
which were not available in the 2017 CSS.
The only ridership changes considered in the Average Fare Analysis are those associated with the changes in the
average fare per boarding due to pricing changes, introduction of fare capping and the income eligibility expansion
for the LiVE Program to include household income up to 250% of the federal poverty level. The Average Fare
Analysis does not assume any ridership changes due to application of fare elasticities. Fare elasticity is a measure
of rider sensitivity to changes in fare rates and the resulting change in ridership behavior. Elasticity assumptions
are essential to modeling anticipated ridership and fare revenue impacts from fare policy changes, but is often
excluded from fare equity analyses. Fare equity analyses seek to understand the average fare experienced by a
segment of customers prior to a fare change and after a fare change, in order to determine the % change in
average fare. This calculation becomes unnecessarily complex when a customer segment is anticipated to attract
new customers to the system or from other fare products. Therefore, fare elasticity is excluded in order to
compare the average fare impacts of the fare changes on the same segment of customers after the change in
pricing and policies.
The Average Fare Analysis does not assume any increase in electronic MyRide fare adoption as RTD continues to
explore expanded retail opportunities for its electronic MyRide fare collection system at the time of the
preparation of this report. Introduction of expanded retail opportunities for MyRide beyond the four RTD Sales
Outlets that are currently open will improve access for unbanked and underbanked customers to load cash to
their accounts. Based on the 2019 CSS data, non-minority and non-low-income customers disproportionately use
electronic fare media (MyRide stored value and RTD Mobile Tickets App at the time of the 2019 CSS) at a higher
rate compared to minority and low-income customers. If RTD were to introduce a set of expanded MyRide retail
opportunities to increase access for customers to load cash to their accounts, MyRide adoption is presumed to
increase for minority and low-income customers. Because the Average Fare Analysis is based on 2019 CSS data
and does not assume any increase in electronic MyRide fare adoption, the Average Fare Analysis may understate

the benefits of fare capping for minority and low-income customers as it assumes that overall customers will
disproportionately benefit from fare capping compared to minority and low-income customers.

For customer demographic data, the analysis relied on the 2019 CSS, the most recent comprehensive, on-board
customer survey undertaken by RTD that provides information on customer demographics and fare payment. The
2019 CSS was undertaken by BBC Research, a contractor hired by RTD, whose research surveyors conducted 3,811
surveys.
In addition to the 2019 CSS, the 2020 LiVE Program Survey was used for demographics for LiVE customers. RTD
launched its LiVE Program in July 2019, after the 2019 CSS was conducted. Unlike the 2019 CSS that was conducted
onboard vehicles, the 2020 LiVE Program Survey was conducted via email and US mail. RTD invited the 6,579
customers whose applications were approved within the 12 months leading up to the survey to participate. After
removing duplicates, 886 surveys were included in the final LiVE Program Survey data set.
RTD’s 2017 CSS was considered for use in the analysis instead of the 2019 CSS, given the much larger sample of
completed surveys (9,936). However, the survey included limited customer response data on electronic fare
adoption due to the timing of when the survey was conducted (May 2017) and when electronic fares launched –
MyRide Stored Value (May 2017) and RTD Mobile Tickets App (November 2017).
While the demographics of transit ridership may have changed due to COVID, the 2019 CSS provides the most
comprehensive and recent survey data available of systemwide demographics, and likely provides a conservative
assessment of the impacts of the proposed fare changes on minority and low income customers. Evidence from a
number of transit agencies across the US suggest that the share of minority and low-income customers has
increased as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. While RTD has no current survey data to indicate whether that is
true in the RTD service area, if one assumes it to be true then this current Fare Equity Analysis (with an assumed
lower share of minority and low-income customers) would show less beneficial differences in average fare
between minority and low-income customers and the system overall. Alternatively stated, if minority and lowincome ridership has increased, the difference in the impacts of the proposed fare changes between the overall
customer population and minority and low-income customers would decrease. This is because in determining the
impacts on the overall customer population, the weight of the impacts on minority and low-income customers
would increase, while the weight of the impacts on non-minority and non-low-income customers would decrease.
Additionally, there have been concerns about the potential movement of low-income and minority households
into outer regions of the RTD service area and their reliance on RTD services that require the Regional fare. While
there is no recent RTD-specific survey data suggesting this has occurred, if future survey data were to confirm this
trend, the current Average Fare Analysis using the 2019 CSS provides a conservative estimate of the benefits of
the proposed removal of the Regional fare for longer distance trips. The estimate of benefits may be conservative
because the Average Fare Analysis in this Fare Equity Analysis understates the benefits for minority and lowincome customers who were less likely to pay the Regional fare at the time of the 2019 CSS.

4.1.2 Assumptions
The 2019 CSS, while comprehensive with a significant number of survey responses, does have some limitations.
Low response rates for some rider categories, fare levels and fare payment types, as well as the absence of some
fare payment options on the survey pose several challenges. The Average Fare Analysis attempts to address the

limitations of the data by using demographics for similar rider categories or aggregating responses for different
fare payment types for a specific rider category.

●

Demographics for full fare customers who are not eligible for a discounted fare or for a pass program are
assumed to vary by fare level (Local, Regional, Airport) and by fare payment type, including whether fares
are paid with electronic fare media (i.e., MyRide Stored Value or Mobile Ticket) for 3-Hour and Day Pass
customers.

●

Demographics for youth are assumed to align with the demographics of Local full fare customers. The
methodology of the 2019 CSS specifically avoids targeting youth customers under the age of 18, so this
customer group is underrepresented in the 2019 CSS, representing less than 2% of customers in the
survey. Due to insufficient survey responses, we consider youth demographics to be similar to those of
their family. Additionally, since 93% of youth boardings are assumed to occur on Local services, youth
demographics are assumed to mirror Local full fare customer demographics.

●

Demographics for seniors, individuals with disabilities and Medicare recipients are assumed to vary by
fare level and fare payment type. No distinction in demographics by fare media type is assumed due to
insufficient survey responses. For Airport fares, demographics are aggregated for all fare payment types
due to limited survey responses.

●

Demographics for LiVE customers are assumed not to vary by fare level or fare payment type. The 2020
LiVE Program Survey did not ask respondents about the fare level they typically paid. Responses were
aggregated for all fare payment types as the differences between the fare payment types was minimal.

●

Demographics for expanded LIVE customers are assumed to align with full fare customers with a
household income between 185% and 250% of the federal poverty level who would become eligible for
the LiVE Program. Demographics are assumed to vary by fare level. Demographics are not assumed to
vary by fare payment type due to insufficient survey responses.

●

Demographics for bulk sales are assumed to align with the demographics for all rider categories and fare
payment types for a given fare level.

●

Demographics for pass program customers are assumed to vary by pass program (Business EcoPass,
Neighborhood EcoPass or CollegePass) and fare level (Local, Regional, Airport).

●

Demographics for Semester Pass are assumed to align with the demographics for CollegePass customers.

A number of assumptions were also made in the Average Fare Analysis regarding:

Impact of fare capping on customers and electronic MyRide fare adoption

●

Participation of full fare customers in the LiVE Program with the income eligibility expansion

●

Average fare assumed for Business EcoPass, Neighborhood EcoPass and CollegePass

Introduction of a new LiVE Monthly Pass/Fare Cap and Semester Pass

The Average Fare Analysis assumes the 3-Hour and Day Pass customers using electronic fares will benefit with the
introduction of fare capping, reducing the average fare paid by these customers in addition to the reduction due
to the proposed fare pricing decreases. The Average Fare Analysis assumes that non-minority and non-low-income
customers disproportionately benefit from the introduction of fare capping given their higher adoption of
electronic fare media based on the 2019 CSS.

The following demographic assumptions are used in the Average Fare Analysis:

1.D.3.b
Final Draft Title VI Fare Equity Analysis

July 11, 2023

Introduction of fare capping for customers paying fares using MyRide stored value results in a reduction in the
average fare paid by customers, in particular 3-Hour and Day Pass customers. Instead of purchasing a Day or
Monthly Pass upfront, fares paid by customers accrue towards daily and monthly fare caps, ensuring customers
always pay the best fare. For 3-Hour and Day Pass customers, the cost savings is anticipated to be notable,
especially with the reduction in the full fare Monthly Pass multiple from 38 to 32 times the 3-Hour Pass price. For
Monthly Pass customers, the cost savings is anticipated to be minimal as most Monthly Pass customers are making
more than 38 trips per month and others who purchase the Monthly Pass for convenience are making more than
32 trips per month. The cost savings anticipated for 3-Hour and Day Pass customers using electronic fare media
are incorporated into the average fares for the proposed fare structure. The reduction in the average fare is based
on 2017 CSS data that provide the distribution of 3-Hour and Day Pass respondents by the number of trips taken.
2017 CSS was used because it provided a larger data set than the 2019 CSS as well as the data needed on the
number of trips taken in the last week.
For determining the number of boardings that would potentially benefit from fare capping, the Average Fare
Analysis uses 2021 ticket sales data to determine electronic fare adoption for 3-Hour and Day Pass customers.
Electronic fare adoption is determined by calculating the proportion of tickets sold through the MyRide App
(formerly branded the RTD Mobile Tickets App) and MyRide stored value compared to total purchases, including
purchases at bus fareboxes or rail ticket vending machines. The Average Fare Analysis assumes electronic fare
adoption varies by rider category, fare level and fare payment type. While 3-Hour and Day Pass customers will
continue to be able to purchase 3-Hour and Day Pass mobile tickets rather than using stored value, the Average
Fare Analysis assumes that 100% of electronic fare customers would use MyRide stored value and thus benefit
from fare capping.
For LiVE customers, including those eligible as a result of the income eligibility expansion, the Average Fare
Analysis assumes 100% electronic fare adoption for 3-Hour Pass and Day Pass as these customers must pay fares
using electronic fare media.
The Average Fare Analysis does not assume any adjustment to the average fare paid for 10-Ride Ticket customers
due to the introduction of fare capping. In 2021, less than 2% of 10-Ride Ticket Books were sold through the
MyRide App.
LiVE participation is expected to increase slightly with the expansion of the LiVE Program household income
eligibility limit from 185% to 250% of the federal poverty level. The Average Fare Analysis assumes that these
“expanded LiVE” customers would go from paying the full fare under the current fare structure to paying the LiVE
fare under the proposed fare structure. Given the slightly higher transfer and usage rates for LiVE customers
compared to full fare customers, the average fare for these customers is based on the same transfer and usage
rates as LiVE customers. The increased participation is based on the estimated current LiVE Program participation
rate among income eligible customers and the number of boardings made by full fare customers who would
become income eligible for the LiVE Program as part of the income eligibility expansion. The current LiVE Program

The benefits of fare capping are accrued only by customers paying stored value using a MyRide Barcode in the
MyRide App or MyRide Smart Card. While customers with credit and debit cards are able to load value online or
through the MyRide App and Website, cash customers can only load value at the four RTD Sales Outlets that are
currently open across the region. There is no MyRide retail network at the time of the preparation of this report.
Given the limitations to loading cash to a MyRide account, there is no basis for assuming increased electronic fare
adoption.

1.D.3.b
Final Draft Title VI Fare Equity Analysis

July 11, 2023

Business EcoPass, Neighborhood EcoPass (NECO) and CollegePass contract pricing is based on prior ridership data
and the applicable fare. Given that pricing is based on prior ridership, 2021 contract pricing was based on preCOVID ridership, resulting in a temporarily higher average fare. To reflect the average fare per boarding in the
future as ridership stabilizes, the Average Fare Analysis uses the average fare that would have been collected
based on 2021 ridership data and the applicable fare under the current fare structure and proposed fare structure.
For CollegePass, the total number of boardings is understated. For Auraria Higher Education, RTD introduced an
option to use the MyRide App for CollegePass students. Ridership data for these students using the app is not
available and thus is excluded from the Average Fare Analysis. Further, Auraria Higher Education offered its
CollegePass as an opt-in pass. If Auraria Higher Education returns to an all-in model that provides a CollegePass to
all eligible students, ridership is anticipated to increase.
The Average Fare Analysis assumes the introduction of two new fare payment types: LiVE Monthly Pass (as well
as a monthly fare cap) and Semester Pass. These new fare payment types will likely disproportionately benefit
low-income and minority customers. As such, the assumptions for adoption of these products are constrained in
the Average Fare Analysis so as to not overstate the benefits of the new fare payment types, and are described
further below.
For current LiVE customers, the Average Fare Analysis incorporates the benefits of introducing a LiVE Monthly
Pass to the fare capping assumptions for LiVE 3-Hour and Day Pass customers. For new LiVE customers that
become eligible for LiVE as part of the income eligibility expansion, the Average Fare Analysis incorporates
separate line items for the Monthly Pass as these newly eligible LIVE customers are assumed to transition from
purchasing a full fare Monthly Pass to purchasing a LiVE Monthly Pass. While introducing a LiVE Monthly Pass may
increase interest in the LiVE Program, no increase in LiVE participation is assumed in order to not overstate the
benefits of introducing a LiVE Monthly Pass for low-income and minority customers.
For Semester Pass, the Average Fare Analysis assumes that 1% of full fare Local Monthly Pass customers would
transition to purchasing a Semester Pass. This is based on the share of Monthly Pass customers who indicated
“to/from school/college” as the primary purpose of the trip taken on the 2019 CSS. The analysis was careful to
exclude CollegePass and youth respondents when making the 1% calculation. The Average Fare Analysis does not
assume any transition of full fare Regional Monthly Pass customers to Semester Pass as there were no Regional
Monthly Pass respondents indicating “to/from school/college” as the primary purpose of the trip taken.
While the proposed changes include the introduction of a Transit Assistance Grant Program, the potential
implications of that program are not included in the Average Fare Analysis. The Grant Program is not included
because it is intended to generate new ridership, and grant recipients are to distribute the 10-Ride Ticket Books
at no cost to their clients. Further the tickets distributed through the program are not intended to supplant current
fare purchases by grant recipients.
Within the baseline model, reflecting RTD’s existing fare structure, there is no Airport Monthly Pass. Instead,
customers may use their Regional Monthly Pass for trips that require the Airport fare and the Airport boardings
associated with the use of the Regional Monthly Pass for trips to/from Denver International Airport are included
with the Regional Monthly Pass in the Average Fare Analysis. When evaluating the proposed alternative, the

participation rate and the share of boardings that would become eligible for LiVE as part of income eligibility
expansion are based on the 2017 CSS.

1.D.3.b
Final Draft Title VI Fare Equity Analysis

July 11, 2023

For the Bulk Purchase Program, the Average Fare Analysis assumes that all purchases by nonprofit organizations
in 2021 would transition to the program as well as 10% off full fare Monthly Passes. Prior to the discontinuation
of the FlexPass Program (a prior RTD program similar to the Bulk Purchase Program proposal), approximately 10%
of full fare Monthly Passes were purchased through the program. The FlexPass Program provided a discount on
Monthly Pass purchases based on the number of passes purchased, whether the employer provided a matching
discount to employees and whether the employer offered the FlexPass on a pre-tax basis.
Due to insufficient data to support other assumptions, the Average Fare Analysis assumes that overall customers,
minority customers and low-income customers have identical usage rates and transfer rates for a given fare
payment type. This means that for any given fare payment type, it is assumed that overall, minority and lowincome customers will all have the same average fare. To be clear: the analysis only assumes that the average fare
is identical for overall, minority and low-income customers within a given fare payment type; average fares are
assumed to differ across fare payment types (e.g., 3-Hour Pass, Day Pass), rider categories (e.g., full fare, LiVE
customers) and fare levels (i.e., Local, Regional, Airport).

5 System Ridership Demographics Overview
The following provides an overview of RTD’s systemwide ridership using data from the 2019 CSS, which is the
most recent onboard survey with the detailed information needed for the Fare Equity Analysis. While other data
sources have been consulted for the Fare Equity Analysis, the 2019 CSS provides the most accurate data for
portraying systemwide ridership demographics.
These demographic statistics were considered in the development of the proposed fare changes in order to
minimize or avoid the potential for changes that would result in Disparate Impacts on minority customers or a
Disproportionate Burden on low-income customers.

5.1 Ethnicity Assumptions
For purposes of the Fare Equity Analysis, minority populations are those who have not identified themselves as
“Caucasian/White - not of Hispanic origin” on the 2019 CSS. The analysis did not include respondents who refused
to respond to the racial/ethnicity question. Additionally, respondents who did not choose an ethnicity or race yet
submitted a survey response that did not comport with racial/ethnicity designations (e.g., “Human,” “Female
Only,” “Russian”) were assumed to be non-minority. The racial/ethnicity categories in the survey include:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.

African-American/Black
Asian/Pacific Islander
Caucasian/White - not of Hispanic origin

5.2 Income Assumptions

Table 5 provides the 2019 U.S. HHS Poverty Guidelines and the corresponding RTD low-income definitions by
household size. Because the 2019 CSS asked both household income and household size, the Fare Equity Analysis
was able to use household size and income to categorize each individual survey respondent accurately using U.S.
HHS Poverty Guidelines. Table 6 presents the income categories used in the 2019 CSS. Because the 2019 CSS
income categories are presented as ranges, all respondents within the income ranges that corresponded to the
150% U.S. HHS Poverty Guidelines for income and household size were identified as low-income. This may
overstate the low-income population somewhat, but represents the most inclusive low-income definition. The
analysis did not include those survey respondents who refused to respond to either of the household income and
household size questions, as they could not be properly categorized.

For purposes of the Disproportionate Burden Policy, RTD defines low-income populations as those whose
household income is at or below 150% of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Poverty
Guidelines (also referred to as federal poverty level). To align with the 2019 CSS, the 2019 HHS Poverty Guidelines
were used to determine which populations would be considered low-income.

Figures 1 and 2 provide an overview of systemwide fixed-route ridership by minority and income status for those
who responded to ethnicity and income related questions, excluding those who refused to respond to ethnicity
or income questions. For purposes of the analysis, minority status is characterized as anyone who responded to
anything other than only “Caucasian/White.” Low-income status was determined through a cross tabulation of
household income and size, matching the income to 150% of the U.S. HHS Poverty Guidelines, as discussed above.
It should be noted that for purposes of this Fare Equity Analysis, low-income customers are defined as those at or
below 150% of the federal poverty level. This is different from the current RTD definition for income eligibility for
the income-based LiVE Program, which is set at or below 185% of the federal poverty level for adults ages 20-64.

To support the Fare Equity Analysis, cross-tabulations of the 2019 CSS were performed for those who responded

Because the 2019 CSS was conducted prior to the launch of the LiVE Program, data from the 2020 LiVE Program
Survey and the Average Fare Analysis were used to modify the fare payment profiles to account for the LiVE
Program. Recognizing that various fare changes may impact some protected groups more than others, the
relationship between fare payment type and ethnicity and income was reviewed. Table 7 presents the fare
payment type by minority and income status.

6 Fare Change Proposal
RTD’s Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis project launched in 2022 after customer feedback indicated
that fares are too expensive and difficult to understand. The proposed fare changes include a number of
structural and pricing changes to RTD’s fares, as well as changes to current pass programs, introduction of new
pass programs and technological changes to fare payment, including the introduction of fare capping facilitated
by RTD’s new MyRide fare collection system and described in Section 6.2. The three study goals, (1) equity, (2)
affordability, and (3) simplicity, as well as customer, community and stakeholder input throughout the study led
to the proposed fare changes summarized below.

6.1 Overview of Proposed Fare Changes
Proposed fare changes to be implemented in 2024 include changes to fare pricing, fare structure, pass programs
and the LiVE Program, referenced below.

6.1.1 Fare Structure
●

Simplified fare structure by removing the Regional fare category

●

For customers paying discounted fares, a single price fare level for all travel, including trips originating or
ending at Denver International Airport

RTD’s fare structure comprises three fare levels: Local, Regional and Airport. For rail trips, customers pay a Local
or Regional fare based on the number of zones they travel through while fixed-route bus customers pay a Local
or Regional fare based on the type of service and distance traveled. For FlexRide trips, customers pay the Local
fare. The Airport fare applies to any rail travel in the Airport zone and for most bus service to/from Denver
International Airport.
Under the proposed fare changes, full fare customers will pay a flat fare for all travel except for select trips
originating or ending at Denver International Airport. Customers who begin or end their trip or who transfer at
Denver International Airport will pay the Airport fare on select services. Customers who do not travel to Denver

International Airport but use fixed-route bus services with the Airport fare will continue to be able to downgrade
the fare to pay the Local fare (e.g., SkyRide routes).

Customers paying discounted fares, including seniors, individuals with disabilities, LiVE customers and youth, will
pay a single price and will not be subject to the Airport fare. This will provide these customers with access
throughout the region for a single price.
Currently, customers who use a Local pass for a Regional or Airport trip or a Regional pass for an Airport trip must
pay an upgrade. The proposed fare changes flatten the fare structure by removing the Regional fare level for all
customers and the Regional and Airport fare level for customers paying discounted fares. These changes eliminate
the need for unique Regional fare products. Further, customers paying discounted fares will no longer need to pay
an upgrade for any travel. Upgrades will only be required for full fare Local 3-Hour and Day Pass customers making
trips requiring the Airport fare.

6.1.2 Fare Discounts
●

Increased LiVE discount from 40% to 50% on 3-Hour Pass and Day Pass

●

Increased discount on the Monthly Pass for customers paying discounted fares to 70%, establishing one
Monthly Pass price for customers paying discounted fares

●

No change to 50% discount on 3-Hour Pass and Day Pass for seniors, individuals with disabilities and/or
Medicare recipients

●

No change to 70% discount on 3-Hour, Day and Monthly Passes for youth aged 19 and younger

Seniors, individuals with disabilities and Medicare recipients will continue to receive a 50% discount on full fare 3Hour Pass and Day Pass, equating to a $1.35 3-Hour Pass and a $2.70 Day Pass. RTD proposes to increase the LiVE
discount from 40% to 50% of the full fare Local 3-Hour and Day Pass. This aligns the LiVE discount/pricing with the
discount for seniors, individuals with disabilities and Medicare recipients resulting in one, unified discounted fare
level.
If the Zero Fare for Youth pilot is not implemented, or if Zero Fare for Youth is not made permanent after the pilot
period, youth will continue to receive a 70% discount on full fare 3-Hour, Day and Monthly Passes.
The discount on the Monthly Pass for all customers paying a discounted fare will increase to 70%, establishing one
discounted price of $27.00.
For details on specific pricing assumed in the Fare Equity Analysis, see Table 8 in Section 6.2.

6.1.3 Fare Capping
●

Introduction of daily (service day) and monthly (calendar) fare capping for customers using MyRide
stored value with MyRide Barcode in the MyRide App or a new MyRide Smart Card

Prepared for: Regional Transportation District

20

Prepared by: Four Nines Technologies

Packet Pg. 93

Attachment: Attachment B - Title VI Fare Equity Analysis Report (4791 : Title VI Fare Equity Analysis)

Routes 104L, 169L and 145X serving Denver International Airport will not be subject to the Airport fare. Routes
104L and 169L do not currently charge the Airport fare for trips originating or ending at Denver International
Airport. Route 145X does currently charge the Airport fare, but will not be subject to the Airport fare for trips
originating or ending at Denver International Airport under this proposal.

1.D.3.b
July 11, 2023

RTD’s new MyRide fare collection system enables RTD to introduce fare capping, which offers customers the best
fare based on their trip-making behavior. Unlike Monthly Passes, customers do not need to purchase a Monthly
Pass upfront. With fare capping, customers can pay as they go and have their fares capped on a daily or monthly
basis such that they do not exceed the price of a comparable Day Pass or Monthly Pass. This removes financial
barriers for customers who may not be able to pay for a Monthly Pass upfront and also increases convenience for
customers by providing them the best fare without needing to determine whether to purchase a pass upfront.
Customers using stored value with MyRide Barcode in the MyRide App or a new MyRide Smart Card will be able
to take advantage of fare capping.
All fares paid with MyRide stored value will apply towards the daily and monthly fare caps. For full fare customers
traveling to/from Denver International Airport, Airport fares and upgrades may apply until the customer pays the
equivalent of the price of the Airport Day Pass or Monthly Pass.
While under the proposed fare structure, all Monthly Pass customers will be able to travel to/from Denver
International Airport without paying an Airport upgrade, full fare customers using fare capping will be paying on
a trip-by-trip basis towards the daily and monthly fare caps. These customers will pay the Airport fare or upgrade
until they reach the Airport daily fare cap or monthly fare cap.

6.1.4 Fare Pricing
●

Lowered Local and Airport fares

●

Lowered Monthly Pass multiple to reflect hybrid work schedules and provide greater affordability for
transit-reliant customers

●

Eliminated the discount on 10-Ride Ticket Books for full fare customers, seniors, individuals with
disabilities and Medicare recipients

The Airport fare will remain, but the fare will be lowered from $10.50 to $10.00 for a full fare 3-Hour Pass/Day
Pass. The Local fare will also be lowered from $3.00 to $2.75 for a full fare 3-Hour Pass and from $6.00 to $5.50
for a full fare Day Pass. Lower full fare Local fares will result in lower fares for customers paying discounted fares.
The discount on 10-Ride Ticket Books will be eliminated for full fare customers, seniors, individuals with disabilities
and Medicare recipients. LiVE and youth 10-Ride Ticket Books do not currently include a discount. 10-Ride Ticket
Books will be priced at 10 times the price of the applicable 3-Hour Pass. More information about the availability
of 10-Ride Ticket Books is presented in Section 6.2.
RTD will decrease the full fare Monthly Pass multiple from 38 to 32 times the price of the full fare 3-Hour Pass,
resulting in an $88 Monthly Pass and monthly fare cap for full fare customers. One Monthly Pass price will be
established for customers paying discounted fares. This Monthly Pass will be discounted approximately 70%,
equating to a Monthly Pass multiple of 31.8 for youth, and a Monthly Pass multiple of 20.0 for seniors, individuals
with disabilities, Medicare recipients and LiVE customers.
For details on specific pricing assumed in the Fare Equity Analysis, see Table 8 in Section 6.2.
While paratransit fare changes are not analyzed in this Fare Equity Analysis, RTD will be changing its Access-a-Ride
fares. The Local Access-a-Ride fare will change from $5.00 to $4.50, and the Airport Access-a-Ride fare will change
from $20.00 to $19.00. The Regional Access-a-Ride will be discontinued. Customers can pay their Access-a-Ride
fare in cash on-vehicle or with a mobile ticket. Local paper 6-Ride Ticket Books will continue to be available and

priced at six times the Local Access-a-Ride fare. As part of the proposed fare changes, RTD will also allow eligible
customers to apply a 50% LiVE discount to Access-a-Ride fares.

●

Expanded LiVE eligibility requirements to encourage LiVE participation

●

Introduction of a LiVE paper and mobile Monthly Passes and MyRide monthly fare capping

●

Increased discounts for customers using LiVE fares

●

Travel anywhere in the service area for a single price fare level (no Regional and Airport fare)

The proposed fare changes include expanding access to the LiVE low-income fare program. The income eligibility
threshold will increase from 185% to 250% of the federal poverty level, and customers applying to the LiVE
Program will no longer need an address within RTD’s service district, which will require a change to the Colorado
state PEAK system used for eligibility verification.
RTD will introduce LiVE paper and mobile Monthly Passes as well as monthly fare capping for LiVE customers using
MyRide Barcode in the MyRide App or new MyRide Smart Card. Introduction of the new LiVE Monthly Pass will
improve access to LiVE fares. The Monthly Passes and monthly fare capping will also increase the affordability of
transit for LiVE customers by capping the amount spent on transit for these customers on a calendar month basis.
As noted above in Section 6.1.2, the discount for LiVE customers will increase to 50% on 3-Hour Pass and Day Pass
and 70% on Monthly Passes, aligning them with seniors, individuals with disabilities and Medicare recipients. The
price of 3-Hour and Day Pass for LiVE customers will align with those for seniors, individuals with disabilities and
Medicare recipients. There would be no change to how LiVE customers would purchase 3-Hour Passes and Day
Passes. RTD continues to increase opportunities for LiVE customers to access fare products. As discussed earlier,
RTD is planning on introducing a paper and mobile LiVE Monthly Pass. RTD is also exploring expanded
opportunities to purchase fares using cash at retail locations. At a future point in time, if the provision of LiVE
Monthly Passes and expanded retail opportunities to facilitate cash purchases is still determined to be insufficient
to meet the needs of LiVE customers, RTD may consider other cash payment opportunities. Section 6.1.8 provides
additional detail on expanded retail opportunities, and Table 9 in Section 6.3 identifies the current and proposed
fare distribution by fare payment type and rider category.
Also as noted above in Section 6.1.1, the Regional fare will be removed and the remaining Airport fare will not
apply for LiVE customers under the new fare structure.
Also, while paratransit fare changes are not analyzed in this Fare Equity Analysis, RTD will allow customers to apply
a 50% LiVE discount to Access-a-Ride fares.

6.1.6 Other Programs
●

Establishment of a Transit Assistance Grant Program to assist organizations that serve individuals with
immediate transit needs

●

Introduction of a discount for bulk purchases through a Bulk Purchase Program

●

Introduction of a Semester Pass Program to provide an opt-in pass alternative to the CollegePass
program for smaller colleges and community colleges

6.1.5 LiVE Eligibility, Fare Products and Discounts

1.D.3.b
Final Draft Title VI Fare Equity Analysis

July 11, 2023

RTD proposes to introduce a Transit Assistance Grant Program to help organizations serving clients with
immediate transit needs. RTD will initially distribute up to $1 million of full fare paper 10-Ride Ticket Books per
calendar year at no cost to grant recipients. The grant recipients must distribute the tickets to their clients or
constituents for free. RTD will release one annual call for grant proposals and a grant program selection panel,
consisting of internal RTD staff and external stakeholders, will determine grant recipients based on clear and
transparent evaluation criteria, such as an organization’s IRS Tax Exempt Letter and whether they serve
populations with immediate transit needs. The RTD in consultation with the grant program selection panel will
determine evaluation criteria, the scope of reporting requirements and participant responsibilities. RTD is
budgeting internal funding for the Transit Assistance Grant Program; however, in the future, RTD may seek
supplemental funding from external partners.
Bulk Purchase Program
The proposed Bulk Purchase Program will introduce a 10% discount on bulk purchases with an invoice amount of
$1,500 or more. RTD currently allows organizations and employers to purchase fare products in bulk, but does not
provide a discount on bulk purchases. Contracts are currently required for recurring bulk paper purchases or any
mobile bulk purchases. Customers will be able to purchase all fare products available to the public through the
Bulk Purchase Program except stored value, and current contract rules are likely to remain. The discount does not
apply to EcoPass, Neighborhood EcoPass or CollegePass contracts. If the ability to purchase stored value for
individuals in bulk becomes available in the future, the bulk discount would not apply to stored value loads.
While any individual or organization can purchase fare products through the Bulk Purchase Program, RTD will
manage payments differently based on organization and sale type. For nonprofit and community based
organizations, online orders, and one-time orders, customers will prepay. Customers with unused paper fare
products are not eligible for refunds, but nonprofit and community based organizations may be eligible to
exchange expired, unused paper 10-Ride Ticket Books. Customers purchasing bulk mobile passes will pay for the
passes that are activated and used, with the discount calculated once utilization is determined and if the invoice
amount is $1,500 or more.
While employers or organizations purchasing fare products via the Bulk Purchase Program may pass on the cost
of the pass to employees or clients, the amount collected cannot exceed the amount paid for the pass.
Semester Pass
In response to community feedback about alternatives to CollegePass, RTD proposes to establish a Semester Pass
Program for post-secondary educational institutions, targeted towards smaller colleges and community colleges.
The program will be open to post-secondary educational institutions not enrolled in CollegePass. Participating
institutions will offer the Semester Pass to enrolled part-time or full-time students, and institutions can pass
through the entire cost of the pass or subsidize all or part of the cost for students. Students purchasing a Semester
Pass will be able purchase the pass on an opt-in basis from the participating institution. Participating institutions
that subsidize the Semester Pass may also opt to subsidize the pass for all or a subset of students.
The Semester Pass will be valid for a term duration set by the institution. The pricing will total approximately 80%
of a full fare Monthly Pass per month of the valid term. Students will be able to use the Semester Pass on all fixedroute and FlexRide services, including travel to/from Denver International Airport.

Students eligible for LiVE fares, students with disabilities or youth may opt not to participate in the Semester Pass
program, as discounted fares will provide lower fare prices.
RTD will collect the fare revenue from the participating institution based on the passes issued. The institutions will
be responsible for collecting fees and distributing the passes to their students.

●

Simplified EcoPass, Neighborhood EcoPass, and CollegePass programs

Business EcoPass
RTD’s Business EcoPass is an employer-sponsored pass that provides eligible employees at participating employers
unlimited rides on fixed-route and FlexRide services. The program is based on a calendar year and is an all-in,
insurance-based model, which means employers must purchase passes for every eligible employee. Employers
can decide to completely subsidize the price of the pass, or pass all or part of the costs on to the employee, who
can pay for it with pre-tax dollars. Business EcoPass pricing is based on three factors: number of employees, a
business’s location in the RTD service area (referred to as Service Level Areas (SLAs)) and actual ridership two
years in arrears (referred to as utilization-based pricing). For large employers with over 3,000 employees,
employer-specific ridership data is used for pricing. For new large employers, SLA pricing is used until employer
specific ridership data is available for contract pricing. RTD manages the program via annual contracts with
employers. Independent of the policy changes proposed in the Fare Study, RTD will eliminate photos on Business
EcoPass MyRide Smart Cards.
There are several proposed changes to the Business EcoPass program.
●

RTD will introduce fixed pricing for 2-year intervals starting in 2024 and 2025. Currently, pricing is updated
annually. Pricing in 2-year intervals will apply to employers subject to SLA pricing, and large employers.

●

RTD will consolidate SLA A (suburban) and SLA B (major transit centers), and consolidate all employer size
categories (currently four) to a single size category. This will reduce the total number of pricing zones
across the region from 16 to three.

●

The contract minimums will be reduced from $1,368/year for SLAs A and B, and $2,400/year for SLAs C
and D to a single contract minimum of $950/year for all SLAs. This is equal to the purchase of 12 Monthly
Passes at the Bulk Purchase Program price.

●

All trips taken by Business EcoPass participants will be priced at the full fare, Local fare rate, and the
Airport fare will not be applied when determining utilization pricing. Currently, the Business EcoPass
pricing applies the applicable fare level (Local, Regional, Airport) for each trip taken when determining
utilization pricing. As the Local Monthly Pass will now be valid for all travel, including to/from Denver
International Airport, without an Airport upgrade, the Business EcoPass will also entitle the passholder to
travel to/from Denver International Airport.

●

Participants will have the option to use the MyRide App rather than a MyRide Smart Card. Historically,
employees participating in EcoPass received a MyRide smart card with their name and photo on it.

Although fare capping will be available to the general public, fare capping will not apply to Business EcoPass
utilization pricing. Similarly, RTD will not provision entitlements onto eligible Business EcoPass participants’

accounts, so discounted fares will not be factored into utilization pricing. Further, the discount offered through
the Bulk Purchase Program will not apply to Business EcoPass contracts.

Neighborhood EcoPass (NECO) is a pass program providing residents of enrolled neighborhoods, apartment
buildings and/or homeowner associations unlimited rides on fixed-route and FlexRide services. The NECO program
operates in a similar way to Business EcoPass and is based on an all-in, insurance-based model, which means
neighborhoods must purchase passes for all household residents, but pricing is slightly different. For new NECO
contracts, pricing is initially based on a fixed price per household. Once neighborhood specific data is available,
pricing is based on utilization ridership data for the neighborhood. Unlike Business EcoPass, RTD incorporated fare
discounts for youth, seniors and individuals with disabilities in determining NECO pricing. While historically NECO
participants have been provided with a NECO MyRide smart card with their photo on it, policy changes
independent of the Fare Study will mean that future NECO MyRide Smart Cards will not have photos.
There are several proposed changes to the NECO program.
●

Similar to Business EcoPass, all trips taken by NECO participants will be priced at the full fare, Local fare
rate, and the Airport fare will not be applied when determining utilization pricing. Further, no fare
discounts will be applied for youth, seniors and individuals with disabilities for contract pricing.

●

RTD will make permanent the temporary reduction of the NECO contract minimum from $7,000 to $4,000.
Prior to COVID, the contract minimum for a neighborhood was $7,000. During COVID, due to decreases in
transit ridership, the contract minimum was temporarily reduced to $4,000.

●

RTD will reduce new neighborhood pricing from $175 per household per year to $125 per household.

●

Participants will have the option to use the MyRide App rather than a MyRide Smart Card. Historically,
residents participating in NECO received a MyRide smart card with their name and photo on it.

●

Since utilization pricing will not take into account fare discounts for youth, seniors and individuals with
disabilities, NECO neighborhood coordinators will not need to provide information on whether a
participant would qualify for a fare discount, simplifying their roles and responsibilities. Further, RTD will
not add entitlements onto eligible NECO participants’ accounts.

In alignment with Business EcoPass, fare capping will not apply to NECO pricing.
CollegePass
CollegePass is a pass program offered to post-secondary educational institutions. Students enrolled in CollegePass
can take unlimited rides on fixed-route and FlexRide services. RTD maintains annual contracts with colleges and
universities based on the all-in, insurance-based model with institution-specific utilization pricing. As an all-in
program, institutions are required to enroll all eligible students into CollegePass. CollegePass is not an opt-in pass
program for students (see proposed Semester Pass for opt-in program for post-secondary educational
institutions). For new CollegePass contracts, pricing is initially based on a fixed price per student until institutionspecific ridership data is available for contract pricing. Colleges and universities can decide to completely subsidize
the price of the pass, or pass all or part of the costs to students. While historically CollegePass students have been
provided with a MyRide smart card with their photo on it, policy changes independent of the Fare Study will mean
that future CollegePass MyRide Smart Cards will not have photos.

●

Similar to EcoPass, all trips taken by CollegePass participants will be priced at the full fare, Local fare rate,
and the Airport fare will not be applied when determining utilization pricing. In alignment with Business
EcoPass and NECO, RTD will not count discounted fares toward utilization pricing for CollegePass.

●

RTD will reduce the pricing for new colleges/universities from approximately $26 per student per month
to $15 per student per month.

●

Contract minimums for participating colleges will decrease from $15,600 per academic year to $9,000 per
academic year.

●

Students will have the option to use the MyRide App rather than a MyRide Smart Card. Historically,
students participating in CollegePass received a MyRide smart card with their name and photo on it.

In alignment with Business EcoPass and NECO, fare capping will not apply to CollegePass pricing.

6.1.8 Additional Fare Guidance
The Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis identified additional fare changes and/or pilots. These
changes/pilots are not evaluated in this Fare Equity Analysis.
Zero Fare for Youth Pilot Program
RTD is intending to proceed with a Zero Fare for Youth Pilot Program for a period of up to 18-months. The
proposed Zero Fare for Youth Pilot Program is not included in this Fare Equity Analysis or in the Average Fare
Analysis, but should the pilot be made permanent or extend beyond 6-months without a waiver from FTA, a Title
VI Fare Equity Analysis would be required. The duration of the pilot would be up to 18-months with a start date
to be determined. All youth ages 19 and younger, regardless of residency, would be eligible for participation in
the pilot. Proof of eligibility that would be required to ride free is to be determined. The pilot would likely be
supported by internal RTD funds with potentially some additional support from external funding partners. A
permanent Zero Fare for Youth Program would be contingent upon the availability of sustainable, external
funding. At the conclusion of the pilot, if it was not made permanent, youth fares would revert to a 70% discount
on the full fare 3-Hour, Day and Monthly Passes, as noted in Section 6.1.2.
Because the Zero Fare for Youth Program is intended as a pilot with no established schedule for either
implementation or termination, this Fare Equity Analysis and Average Fare Analysis assumes that the fare pricing
for youth ages 19 and younger would remain at a 70% discount of the full fare before and after the pilot. For
details on specific pricing assumed in the Fare Equity Analysis, see Table 8 in Section 6.2.
LiVE Access Expansion
During customer, community and stakeholder outreach, RTD received feedback for the need to increase
awareness of the LiVE Program and work with community partners to better market and expand access to the
LiVE Program. RTD plans to develop a comprehensive outreach and engagement action plan. RTD also plans to
explore expanding means testing beyond the current State of Colorado’s PEAK system, which is used to determine
eligibility for federal and state assistance programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)
and Colorado’s Medicaid program. Expanding means testing beyond the PEAK system and changes to eligibility

criteria not listed above in Section 6.1.5 are not included in this Fare Equity Analysis or in the Average Fare Analysis,
but should the criteria for eligibility change, a Title VI Fare Equity Analysis would be required.

The ability for customers to load cash into their MyRide accounts is critical for promoting equitable access and
adoption of the electronic MyRide fares. At the time of preparation of this report, cash customers can only load
value to their MyRide account at the four RTD Sales Outlets that are currently open in the region. Expansion of
MyRide retail opportunities beyond the four RTD Sales Outlets will improve access for unbanked and underbanked
customers to load cash to their accounts. While RTD plans to expand MyRide retail opportunities, RTD is still in
the process of procuring retail expansion opportunities and as such it is not included in this Fare Equity Analysis.
The introduction of a substantially expanded set of retail opportunities would require a future Title VI review.

6.2 Pricing, Payment and Media Changes
Table 8 summarizes the proposed fare pricing changes by fare payment type. Several fare changes aim to simplify
RTD’s fare structure and introduce more equitable and affordable fares for RTD customers.
Proposed fare media and product changes include introduction of fare capping, elimination of all Regional fare
products and acceptance of Local fare products on Regional services, elimination of mobile 10-Ride Ticket Books
and introduction of a LiVE Monthly Pass and fare cap.
●

RTD will introduce daily (service day) and monthly (calendar) fare capping for customers using MyRide
stored value with MyRide Barcode in the MyRide App or a new MyRide Smart Card, as noted in Section
6.1.3

●

RTD will eliminate mobile 10-Ride Ticket Books since discounts will no longer be provided on 10-Ride
Ticket Books as noted in Section 6.1.4 and customers will be able to purchase multiple mobile 3-Hour
Passes in the MyRide App in one transaction. Customers will continue to be able to purchase paper 10Ride Ticket Books via the RTD Online Store, RTD and Third Party Sales Outlets and the Bulk Purchase
Program. RTD will also distribute paper 10-Ride Ticket Books through the proposed Transit Assistance
Grant Program discussed in Section 6.1.6.

●

RTD will introduce a LiVE Monthly Pass and fare cap, which will align with the other discounted fare
Monthly Pass/cap, as noted in Section 6.1.5.

The fare payment types that are highlighted in light teal are newly available fare payment types (e.g., daily and
monthly fare capping), while the fare payment types that are highlighted in light gray are discontinued fare
payment types (e.g., mobile 10-Ride Ticket Books).

6.3 Media Distribution and Sales Outlets Changes
The proposed fare changes impact the fare payment types available through different sales channels.
Customers can currently purchase 10-Ride Ticket Books, Monthly Passes and Access-a-Ride Ticket Books at four
RTD Sales Outlets: Civic Center Station, Union Station Bus Concourse, Downtown Boulder Station and Denver
Airport Station. A fifth location is temporarily closed (Boulder Junction at Depot Square Station). Third Party Sales
Outlets, which currently include King Soopers and Safeway stores, provide approximately 130 locations across the
metro area for customers to purchase 10-Ride Ticket Books, Monthly Passes and Access-a-Ride Ticket Books.
Customers can purchase paper 10-Ride Ticket Books, paper Monthly Passes and Access-a-Ride Ticket Books via
the RTD Online Store, and RTD sends the purchased fare products in the mail free of charge. These fare payment
types will remain available at the RTD Online Store but the Regional versions of these fare products will be
discontinued. Customers can currently purchase physical MyRide cards online through their MyRide account and
will receive them in the mail free of charge. Customers will continue to have a way to order new MyRide cards
online and receive them in the mail, via the RTD Online Store.
Customers can purchase mobile tickets and passes in the MyRide App or via the MyRide Website and use them in
their MyRide App. Similarly, customers can manage their MyRide account and load value to their account in the
MyRide App or via the MyRide Website. Cash as well as credit and debit card customers can load value to their
MyRide accounts at RTD Sales Outlets. Customers who want to purchase tickets using stored value must convert
the value loaded into their MyRide accounts to mobile tickets in the MyRide App or via the MyRide Website. With
the launch of the new MyRide fare collection system, in addition to using the MyRide App, MyRide Smart Card
customers can load value to their MyRide accounts and manage their accounts similar to MyRide App customers,
although MyRide Smart Card customers cannot purchase mobile tickets to use with their MyRide Smart Card.

Final Draft Title VI Fare Equity Analysis

Customers are no longer able to obtain or reload the new MyRide Smart Cards at select Safeway and King Soopers
stores, as they could previously. Customers will continue to be able to obtain and reload MyRide Smart Cards at
RTD Sales Outlets. In the future, RTD plans to expand MyRide retail opportunities for the new MyRide fare

7 Fare Proposal Outreach
The following is a summary of themes across the feedback received.

In the fourth and final phase of public engagement for the RTD Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis,
customers and community members had the opportunity to provide feedback on the recommended changes to
the fare structure, policies and programs through public comment. The public comment period was open from
April 13 to May 24, 2023.
Public comment could be submitted in several formats, including:




Online on the Fare Feedback website, which provided a comprehensive overview of the proposed fare
changes
Written on a paper comment form at Fare Study open houses, station pop-ups and community events
Spoken out loud at one of four virtual public hearings

The public comment form asked for open-ended feedback on three topics: the recommended fare structure,
recommended policies and programs and fare equity (Title VI Analysis). Participants could optionally include their
name, organization with which they were affiliated, and demographic information (including racial and ethnic
background, income, household size and age). A list of organizations represented and a summary of demographic
information of the commenters are included in this summary.

7.2 Summary of Public Comments
Through comments directly related to the fare study, significant support was provided for the components of the
proposal. The following themes were present in the feedback:

Fare Structure
There was significant support for changes to the fare structure that would support the fare study’s goals of
simplicity, affordability and equity. In total, 731 comments were submitted from a variety of methods. Additional
comments unrelated to the fare structure study are not included.




Simplicity: Participants expressed support for the consolidation of the Local and Regional fare levels,
indicating this would provide much needed simplicity and benefit commuters who travel significant
distances.
Affordability: Many commenters expressed appreciation for the reduction in costs, particularly in an era
of increasing inflation. In particular:
o Commenters supported the decreased full fare monthly pass price ($88) and discount monthly
pass price ($27), explaining that this would benefit frequent riders, particularly airport employees
and regular DIA travelers with the inclusion of the Airport fare within the monthly pass.
o Many comments noted that the lower monthly pass price made transit more cost competitive
with driving and parking. Some previous customers indicated that the decrease in fares would
encourage them to begin using RTD services again; commenters believed that may result in
increased transit use/decrease car traffic and related environmental benefits.
o Nonprofit staff members said that the price decreases would support the needs of their clients
who may be transit-reliant or have limited financial resources.

Equity: Commenters noted that transit-reliant equity populations would be well served by this
recommendation. They indicated that changes to the fare structure and discount programs would allow
individuals with disabilities, low-income customers, older adults, and community members who are
unhoused to attend appointments, travel to work or school, and make other necessary trips without
incurring significant cost burdens associated with transit. Others supported the incorporation of the LiVE
discount into Access-a-Ride fares.

There were also some suggestions for further improvements to the fare structure, many of which were considered
through the fare study process but found to be financially or operationally unfeasible.





Simplicity: Many commenters urged RTD to have a single fare for all destinations, including the airport.
Affordability: Many commenters urged RTD to further reduce prices or provide fare-free transit for all
customers. Some commenters indicated the Airport fare ($10) is still a financial burden and is not a costcompetitive option, especially for groups of individuals traveling together. Some also encouraged RTD to
offer higher discounts for customers using Discount programs and suggested that discounts for older
adults should start earlier to coincide with retirement.
Equity: A number of commenters encouraged RTD to consider fares rounded to the nearest (and lowest)
dollar to ensure customers using cash would not overpay for service – or to ensure drivers have change
to offer to customers in return for overpayment. RTD was also encouraged to provide additional outreach
for discount programs to ensure eligible customers were aware of their existence, with grocery stores,
food banks and libraries listed as locations to promote information and possibly offer retail options for
discount pass purchases. Additional feedback on how to more broadly approach RTD’s LiVE program is
outlined below.

Passes and Pass Programs
Commenters also provided support for current and proposed passes and programs.
Zero Fare for Youth
Overwhelming enthusiasm was shown for the Zero Fare for Youth pilot program, noting that this would:






Support youth in accessing school and work
Benefit families who cannot afford fares for multiple children and incentivize larger families who see
driving as a more affordable option
Meet climate goals by encouraging additional ridership
Provide youth with independence and agency
Support lifelong transit use

Comments also encouraged RTD to seek long-term funding sources, potentially through the State of Colorado, to
ensure the program lasts beyond the first year.

Commenters viewed the transit assistance grant program as a benefit for non-profit organizations with limited
budgets who aim to support clients with travel needs to appointments, food banks, job interviews and others.
They also voiced support for the updates to the EcoPass program and its positive impact on commuting
employees.

RTD was also encouraged to consider other ways to decrease the cost of transit for commuting employees,
including those traveling to the airport.

Customers were encouraged to provide feedback on RTD’s outreach plan for the proposed LiVE income-based
fare discount program expansion as well as recommendations of organizations for RTD to partner with to increase
awareness of the LiVE program. These included nonprofit organizations, libraries, college and schools, heath care
facilities and stores among others.
When asked who RTD should partner with to spread the information about the LiVE program, participants
recommended partnering with nonprofits with Spanish speaking constituents, libraries, educational entities
including Denver Public Schools, and healthcare facilities, including those who serve the Spanish speaking
populations.

7.3 Changes to Proposal
In the fourth and final phase of the fare study and equity analysis, the public comments overall demonstrate public
support for the recommended fare structure, policies and programs. Additionally, no items of significant concern
were raised in public comments that suggest further review of the recommendation and its impacts on the
community is necessary. As such, no changes are proposed to the Systemwide Fare Study and Fare Equity Analysis
recommendations, and the final draft Title VI fare equity analysis will be presented to the RTD Board of Directors
for review and adoption.

8 Average Fare Analysis Findings

The Average Fare Analysis uncovered no Title VI equity concerns using RTD’s Board-adopted Title VI Policies. While
changes to some fare payment types would result in a greater percentage change for some populations, the
aggregate, systemwide differences between all customers and minority customers and between all customers and
low-income customers were within the 5% policy threshold. The proposed fare changes are expected to benefit
minority customers and low-income customers to a lesser degree than all customers, but the difference in benefits
do not exceed 5% on a systemwide basis. As such, no mitigations are recommended to proceed with the
implementation of the proposed fare changes based on the Average Fare Analysis.
This Fare Equity Analysis and Average Fare Analysis did not evaluate a Zero Fare for Youth Pilot Program, LiVE
access expansion beyond proposed changes in Section 6.1.5 or the expansion of a MyRide retail opportunities for
cash customers. These items are discussed in Section 6.1.8. A separate Fare Equity Analysis may be required as
RTD moves forward with the implementation of the Zero Fare for Youth Pilot Program or the expansion of MyRide
retail opportunities, depending on the proposed changes. Nonetheless, these changes would likely benefit
minority and low-income customers. As such, the Average Fare Analysis represented in this document likely
understates potential upcoming benefits for minority and low-income customers.
It should also be noted that the introduction of the Transit Assistance Grant Program is not included in the Average
Fare Analysis as the program is intended to generate new ridership, and grant recipients are to distribute the
tickets at no cost to their clients.

8.1 Average Fare by Fare Level and Fare Payment Type
Overall, customers will experience a decrease in the average fare paid per boarding. As shown in Table 12, the
systemwide average fare for all customers would decrease from $1.41 to $1.05 (25.4% decrease). The reduction
in average fare varies dramatically by fare level (Local, Regional, Airport).

Customers paying the Regional fare experience significantly greater reductions in the average fare compared to
customers paying the Local fare (Regional average fare decreases by $1.31, while Local average fare decreases by
$0.17, for a difference of $1.14). This is due to charging the Local fare for trips that previously required paying the
Regional fare. Customers paying the Airport fare also experience greater reductions in the average fare compared
to customers paying the Local fare. This is primarily due to the introduction of fare capping and the reduction in
the Monthly Pass price resulting from reducing the Monthly Pass multiple and including travel to/from the Denver

Local Neighborhood EcoPass is the one specific fare payment type that experiences an increase in the average
fare; however, in aggregate, the NECO program experiences a 22% decrease in average fare when factoring in
Airport and Regional trips. The average fare for NECO customers making a trip that requires the Local fare
increases as a result of no longer taking into account fare discounts for youth, seniors and individuals with
disabilities in contract pricing. However, NECO contracts are priced based on total ridership, and overall, the NECO
program experiences a decrease in the average fare due to the discontinuation of applying the Regional and
Airport fare to determine contract pricing (proposed fare change would price all trips at the Local, full fare for pass
program pricing).

8.2 Average Fare Analysis Results
The Average Fare Analysis uncovered no Title VI equity concerns using RTD’s Board adopted Title VI Policies, but
does note that minority and low-income customers do not benefit as much as the overall population.
A reason that minority and low-income customers do not benefit as much as the overall population in the Average
Fare Analysis is due to the composition of RTD’s customer population and share of ridership by fare level. Minority
and low-income customers rely much more heavily on Local fare level trips compared to all customers, as noted
in Table 14. While the Average Fare Analysis findings suggest that minority and low-income customers do not
benefit as much as the overall customer population due to the significant decreases in Regional and Airport fares,
the proposed fare changes may actually lower financial barriers and improve mobility and access for these
customer populations. By removing the Regional fare level and providing a lower priced Monthly Pass that is valid
for travel anywhere in the RTD service area, the fare structure may allow customers to travel to parts of the region
that they previously chose not to visit or may have been unable to due to the price of Regional and Airport fares.
The Average Fare Analysis analyzes impacts on customers based on current travel behavior and does not attempt
to forecast how proposed changes may alter future travel behavior or improve customer access.

●

Changes that are within 1% are considered to have similar impact and are not highlighted.

As noted in Section 4, the data and methodology used were developed to not overstate the potential benefits of
the proposed fare changes for minority and low-income customers. An increase in the proportion of customers
who are minority and/or low-income systemwide or among customers paying Regional fare as the result of the
COVID impacts on ridership demographics, suburbanization of poverty or reduction of financial barriers to make
longer distance trips with the removal of the Regional fare would increase the benefits of the proposed fare
changes and reduce the difference between the overall customer population and minority and low-income
customers. Further, increased electronic MyRide adoption among minority and/or low-income customers would
increase the benefits of the proposed fare changes and reduce the difference between the overall customer
population and minority and low-income customers.

8.2.1 Key Findings
●

When viewing the fare change from a total system perspective, the average fare for the proposed change
is $1.05 per boarding for all customers, $0.97 for minority customers (8% lower than for all customers)
and $0.84 for low-income customers (20% lower than for all customers).

●

As a whole, minority and low-income populations experience a smaller decrease in their average fare than
the overall customer population. Minority customers experience a 23.1% decrease in their average fare
per boarding and low-income customers experience a 22.0% decrease, compared with a 25.4% decrease
experienced by the overall customer population. It is important to note that each group (overall, minority
and low-income) is anticipated to see an average fare per boarding decrease of 22% or greater.

●

A significant reason for the overall customer population experiencing greater average fare benefits
compared to minority and low-income customers is that the proposed fare changes disproportionately
benefit customers paying the Regional fare, which is disproportionately non-minority and non-lowincome according to the 2019 CSS.
○

Regional boardings represent 8% of minority customer boardings and 5% of low-income customer
boardings, but represent 10% of boardings for the overall customer population.

●

Low-income customers do not benefit from the income eligibility expansion for the LiVE Program. The
proposed fare change increases the household income limit from 185% of the federal poverty level to
250% of the federal poverty level. Both of these income limits exceed the income threshold of 150% of
federal poverty level established by RTD Title VI Policies and used for the purposes of this Fare Equity
Analysis.

●

Minority and low-income customers do not benefit as greatly as the overall customer population from the
introduction of fare capping given their lower electronic fare adoption.
○

For full fare, 34% of overall 3-Hour and Day Pass boardings are made with electronic fares, while
this decreases to 24% and 17% for minority and low-income customers, respectively.

●

The proposed changes to the Business EcoPass program result in minority and low-income customers
benefiting more than the overall customer population. This is largely a function of the demographics and
proposed changes to the Airport portion of the Business EcoPass program. Within the Business EcoPass
program, the Airport fare level has a significantly higher share of minority and low-income customers than
the Local and Regional fare levels, and the Airport fare level for Business EcoPass has the largest
anticipated percentage decrease in average fare resulting in a greater benefit for minority and low-income
customers.

●

The proposed changes to the CollegePass program result in minority and low-income customers
benefiting less than the overall customer population. This is largely a result of the fact that the Local fare
level has the highest proportion of minority and low-income customers, yet is anticipated to experience
a relatively low percentage decrease in average fare. Regional and Airport fare levels have much larger
shares of non-minority and non-low-income customers, yet are anticipated to experience much higher
percentage decreases in average fare. It is important to remember that the structure of CollegePass
contracts is such that all utilization across all customer populations at a college (minority, non-minority,

●

As noted in Table 15, the only group that is anticipated to experience an increase in their average fare in
the study are low-income Neighborhood EcoPass (NECO) program customers. The estimated change in
average fare per boarding for these customers is $0.03. Proposed changes are expected to result in
minority customers also benefiting less than the overall NECO customer population. Low-income NECO
customers in particular disproportionately rely on the Local fare level within the NECO program (90% of
Low-Income NECO boardings are Local vs. 73% of overall NECO boardings), yet the Local fare level for
NECO is the one that is anticipated to experience a sizable increase in average fare due to the proposal to
no longer take into account fare discounts for youth, seniors and individuals with disabilities in contract
pricing. While the Average Fare Analysis suggests that low-income and minority NECO customers are
anticipated to benefit less than the overall population of NECO customers, it is important to remember
that all utilization across all customer populations (minority, non-minority, low-income, non-low-income)
is aggregated together and all households in the same neighborhood pay an identical amount.

8.2.2 Overview of Overall Findings
Table 16 provides the systemwide analysis comparing the average fare for minority customers to the overall
customer population. For minority customers, the average fare decreases from $1.26 to $0.97, a 23.1% decrease.
For all customers, the average fare decreases from $1.41 to $1.05, a 25.4% decrease. The percentage point
difference between the percentage change for minority customers and all customers is +2.3%, indicating that
while both groups experience a decrease in their average fare, all customers are expected to benefit somewhat
more than minority customers as a result of the proposed fare changes. Applying this difference in average fare
changes to RTD’s Disparate Impact Burden threshold, the fare changes do not represent a Disparate Impact on
minority customers as the percentage point difference in percentage change in average fare from the proposed
fare changes does not exceed RTD’s 5% threshold.

Table 17 presents the systemwide analysis comparing the average fare for low-income customers to the overall
customer population. For low-income customers, the average fare decreases from $1.08 to $0.84, a 22.0%
decrease. For all customers, the average fare decreases from $1.41 to $1.05, a 25.4% decrease. The percentage
point difference between the percentage change for low-income customers and all customers is +3.4%, indicating
that while both groups experience a decrease in their average fare, all customers are expected to benefit more
than low-income customers as a result of the proposed fare changes. Applying this difference in average fare

minority and low-income customers at a given college will pay an identical amount as their fellow nonminority and non-low-income students.

As previously noted, individuals with a household income up to 250% of the federal poverty level will be eligible
for the expanded LiVE Program, which exceeds the low-income threshold of 150% of the federal poverty level
established in RTD’s Title VI Policies. As such, there are individuals in the Average Fare Analysis that are classified
as non-low-income but will benefit from the income eligibility expansion for the LiVE Program.

9 Cumulative Findings and Mitigations

Even though RTD’s ridership is not homogenous in terms of ethnicity, income, payment methods or fare type, the
proposed fare changes do not appear to create any Disparate Impacts on minority communities, nor does it appear
to create any Disproportionate Burdens on low-income communities. As such, no mitigations are needed in order
to proceed with the implementation of the proposed fare changes.
Equity was the primary goal for the Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis. As changes to RTD’s fare structure,
pricing and system were considered to achieve other study goals including Affordability and Simplicity, the impacts
of these potential changes on minority and low-income communities were continually examined. The study relied
on a community-driven process, focused on Title VI and historically underrepresented populations. Customer,
community and stakeholder engagements were undertaken to identify unmet needs and potential impacts and
to obtain fare structure preferences among minority and low-income communities.

A Fare Equity Analysis should not take the place of thoughtful planning at the earliest stages of project
development. Considering the impacts that plans, programs or projects have on minority and low-income
communities has been part of the early planning and development process for the Systemwide Fare Study and
Equity Analysis and the study’s recommendations.

It is important to note that this Fare Equity Analysis represents the impacts associated with the proposed fare
changes upon full implementation as adopted by the Board of Directors. As such, should any of the proposed
changes be determined to be technically or administratively unfeasible, a new Fare Equity Analysis would be
required for any proposed changes to the adopted program in order to comply with federal Title VI guidance.
Additionally, if the agency implements the fare change in a way that is inconsistent with what was adopted, the
agency may need to undertake a new Fare Equity Analysis.
While no adverse impacts on minority and low-income customers were identified, RTD continues to focus on
initiatives that support the customer experience for minority and low-income customers. As discussed in Section
6.1.8, RTD is looking at expanded MyRide retail opportunities for customers who prefer to pay with cash, and are
developing a public outreach and engagement plan to promote the LiVE program (See Appendix B) throughout
the region. Both of these initiatives are expected to improve the customer experience for minority and low-income
customers.
It should also be noted that this Fare Equity Analysis does not evaluate a Zero Fare for Youth Pilot Program or
expansion of MyRide retail opportunities for cash customers. A separate Fare Equity Analysis for these may be
required as applicable. The Fare Equity Analysis also did not examine administrative programs that are being
contemplated or developed for the expansion of means testing beyond the current system used in the LiVE
Program, or programs intended to improve outreach and engagement to promote the LiVE Program. Should the
criteria for LiVE eligibility change, a Title VI Fare Equity Analysis would be required.

Summary
In 2019, RTD introduced the LiVE Income-based Fare Discount Program (LiVE program) that allows eligible
customers to save 40% off RTD full fares. The discount is available directly to the customer, and they can apply
for the LiVE discount through the Colorado PEAK website. Currently, participants qualify if they are between the
ages of 20 and 64, live within the RTD service area and have a household income at or below 185 percent of the
Federal Poverty Level (FPL).
As part of RTD’s Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis (Study), RTD is recommending changes to the LiVE
program that would increase the number of income-eligible customers who would be eligible for LiVE Discount
fares. The recommended changes will need to be communicated to the public. This plan aims to identify strategies,
resources, and partners to communicate about these changes (once finalized) and ensure that income-eligible
customers receive the information and support they need to fully participate in and benefit from the program.

Objective

Current State
The LiVE Income-Based Fare Discount Program is currently available to customers who:




Are between the ages of 20 and 64
Live within the RTD service area
Have a household income at or below 185% of the federal poverty guidelines, set annually by the
Department of Health and Human Services based on household size and income

LiVE applications are processed through PEAK, the state's public benefits website. Customers enrolled in LiVE
currently receive a 40% fare discount. LiVE discounts currently apply only to mobile and MyRide 3-Hour Passes,
mobile Day Passes and paper and mobile 10 ride ticket books. Access-a-Ride fares do not receive a LiVE discount
in the current fare structure.

LiVE Program Expansion Recommendation
RTD is recommending changes to the LiVE program including increasing the discount from 40% to 50%. Other
changes would increase the number of income-eligible customers who would be eligible for Discount fares. These
changes are as follows.

Increase the Income a Household Can Earn to Qualify
Currently, individuals with a household income at or below 185% of the federal poverty guidelines qualify for this
program. That means, for example, a family of four with a household income of $55,500 or is income-eligible for
the LiVE program discount. RTD is recommending that individuals with a household income at or below 250% of
the federal poverty guidelines be eligible for the LiVE program. Under the new recommendation, a family of four
could make a household income of $75,000 or less and qualify for the discount.

Eliminate the Requirement to Have an In-District Address
RTD is recommending eliminating the requirement to provide a home or mailing address within RTD boundaries
as a qualification for the LiVE program. Doing so would simplify and streamline the enrollment process, provide
more equitable access to customers who are unhoused or underhoused, and provide access to customers who use
RTD but live just outside of the District boundaries.

Attachment: Attachment B - Title VI Fare Equity Analysis Report (4791 : Title VI Fare Equity Analysis)

To reach and educate customers and the public (especially those who are income-eligible) about changes to RTD’s
LiVE Income-Based Fare Discount Program, encourage participation in the program and provide the informational
and logistical support needed to ensure a smooth transition for the LiVE program expansion.

Apply LiVE Discounts to Access-a-Ride Fares
RTD is recommending expanding LiVE discounts to include Access-a-Ride fares for customers who qualify for and
enroll in the program. That would mean that Access-a-Ride customers with household incomes at or below 250%
of the federal poverty guidelines would be eligible for a lower fare, paying $2.25 for the Standard fare (all current
Local and Regional routes) and $9.50 for travel to and from the airport. Visit the Access-a-Ride page for more

information. In addition, the age limits for LiVE eligibility would not apply to Access-a-Ride customers since youth
and senior discounts are not provided for Access-a-Ride fares.

RTD is exploring opportunities to work with community partners to help individuals apply for LiVE. RTD is also
exploring ways to verify an individual is income-eligible outside of the PEAK system and in addition to income
verification by Denver Human Services. Community partners would provide local, trusted support to help incomeeligible customers to enroll in and benefit from Discount fares, increasing the use of equity programs. Verifying
eligibility outside of the PEAK system would simplify and streamline the process for income-eligible customers who
have provided similar documentation through other entities.

Strategy
Through a mix of in-system printed assets, digital and social media channels, community events, open houses,
meetings, in-person and virtual presentations as well as Public Relations efforts, RTD will inform customers and
the public about the finalized changes to the LiVE program as a result of the Study.

Transit Equity Office – Language Access
Based on 2021 RTD survey data, non-English-speaking customers indicated that they rode RTD at least a few
times per week, with a quarter indicating that they rode RTD every single day. The results of this survey along
with other national data illustrates that non-English-speaking populations may rely on public transportation services
more than people who speak English as a preferred language. Additionally, non-English-speaking populations have
a high concentration of immigrants, refugees, asylee seekers and others who, as a result of low incomes given
legal and logistical barriers to fully participate in local economic opportunities, would qualify for the revised LiVE
program. Consequently, the 2024 LiVE program outreach must ensure that it provides language access to
information on the LiVE program changes as well as adequate language assistance support. While all LiVE materials
and the PEAK application itself are currently available in Spanish, this is not the case for other languages.

All Communications assets produced for 2024 LiVE outreach will include a short boilerplate on
language assistance services available (e.g., interpretation and translation)
Press releases will be translated into Spanish, Vietnamese and Chinese and distributed to relevant
multicultural media groups
Transit Equity Office will work with Public Relations staff to offer a Spanish translation of News Stop
articles related to the LiVE program expansion
Transit Equity Office will work with Communications to translate all key assets (e.g., instructions to
apply on PEAK) into Vietnamese and Chinese. The most relevant assets will be strategized by priority
and translated into RTD’s safe harbor languages using the Language Access Plan as guidance and
by working with resettlement agencies/immigrant- and refugee-focused community-based
organizations to identify the most needed resources and languages
Transit Equity Office will identify multilingual community-based organizations and events to host
presentations and Q&A sessions on the LiVE program updates, working with the appropriate
interpreters as needed. Potential organizations include (but are not limited to) Spring Institute,
African Community Center, Boulder County for All, Montbello Organizing Committee and DRMAC
Provide links to the most relevant translated assets on the new LiVE program on the LiVE webpage
on rtd-denver.com as well as other relevant pages

Target Audiences
The target audience of this outreach should center individuals who would benefit the most from the LiVE program
changes as well as the organizations that serve these individuals. Specifically, this entails outreach to people with
low incomes, BIPOC, seniors, non-English-speaking populations (e.g., immigrants and refugees) and people with
disabilities.

Is RTD concerned about being able to fund the fare free after the pilot? Or are you thinking that can
roll forward without hiccups?
I am absolutely amazed at how this process went and in what you have come up with. I think it's
brilliant. It will help so many people. Thank you so much for this.
I believe that the fare structure will help especially those who rely heavily on RTD transportation in
their daily lives. I believe that it fair policies and programs. Working as a case worker the support RTD
provides to our families in immeasurable and astounding.
Thank you for your service during the pandemic, you are awesome.
I definitely appreciate the added security - makes me feel safer to ride.
Please lower rates.
I am all for it! Reduce fares yay!
Yes! Reduce fares!
This is a great package of changes. I’m on board with the higher airport cost as it still is the most
affordable option vs Uber or parking. However, I tend to still choose Uber or parking because of the
train schedules that don’t line up which make an already lengthy journey even longer when you
deboard your train at Union Station and find out you just missed the connection you needed. An
increase in frequency of trips (or slightly adjusted to make those types of connections more possible)
would make me reevaluate using the train.
I agree with the proposed RTD fare changes and believe that if fares were lowered, RTD would be
more attractive as a method of transportation around the Denver Metro area.
Fare structure- recommend a tap on tap off structure like in Sydney Australia that you can use credit
card or local card. It avoids educating on fairs and you can keep short trips cheaper than the 3 hour
rule currently. Cost based on tap on and tap off rather than time can increase revenue based on
infrequent users and still create predictible revenue and access for frequent users. Recommend
researching their system if that hasn't been done. Programs- offer families with school age children
who qualify for government programs to access free transit for adults and children. Offer stop gap
emergency cards to schools to support families experiencing homelessness, lost a car, or are highly
mobile. Right now schools can apply for a nonprofit discount but would love to be able to give out
free monthly cards as needed that cover an adult and their children to reduce chronic absenteeism
and support highly mobile families with staying at a consistent school. Also having a way to send the
passes and cards to schools rather than a centralized location can help networks and individual
schools have passes regularly without needing to ship them or drive them to each location.
I think this is a fantastic idea and will help to further encourage greater usage of RTD services!
I wholeheartedly support all of these recommendations. This is the type of policy that impacts our
hardest working Coloradans, our young people, and people in need. We all win with this type of
forward thinking. My favorite though is the no-cost youth pass! Louisville, KY did this a decade ago
and it was a game changer for youth development. Well done, team RTD!
I am a big supporter of the new fare structure. I think these changes will lead to more ridership and
they make me more likely to use the RTD system more often. I hope we continue to implement
changes like these to encourage greater use of public transportation.

I support the new fare structure that lowers cost and simplifies the fares. I utilize the train to get from
my home in Arvada to the airport approximately 3-4 times a year. I also use the train occasionally to
go into Denver to attend sporting events, concerts, and meet with friends near Union Station. In all of
these cases, taking the train lessens the hassle and cost of parking, which is appreciated. Simpler fare
structure helps with our out of town guests as well. It's great to have the train as an option when
friends are visiting from out of town, so they can access the city and the airport independently if
needed. I also really appreciate the changes to the policies and programs to help make utilizing the
train an affordable and accessible choice for all populations in Denver. I think these programs and
the efforts towards Fare Equity will go a long way to increase the use of the train system in Denver.
I do wish the Gold line ran more frequently and that there was expanded access from Denver to
Boulder. Maybe with increased usage over time, we'll see initiatives like these become a reality.
I really appreciate the overall simplification of fares, which will benefit everyone. Although I use the
RTD app, which makes paying easy, it can be tricky to figure out how much a trip is going to cost these
days. The new plan will be easier. Also, as a Senior, I'm excited to note the lower cost, especially for
trips to the airport. The new package looks good!
I believe that the fare structure will help especially those who rely heavily on RTD transportation in
their daily lives. I believe that it fair policies and programs. Working as a care worker and the support
RTD provides to our facilities is immeasurable and astounding.
Thank you for your service during the Pandemic. You are awesome.
I definatly appreciate the added security makes me feel safer to ride.
Fare structure can be confusing especially when using bus+ lightrail/commuter rail. Also a study
needs to be done to make routes more efficient. RTD is usually slower than driving in traffic.
Accepting credit/debit card would be useful too.
Lower fares enable people to get to work, improving the city economy!
I would like to see the Recommended Fare structure implemented. Also return of the FF2 route and
the promised Boulder-Denver rail line.
Simple is better and encourages more riders
Great to make available to those most needing services and more accessible.
Its scary. (I just have anxiety, nothing against RTD)
I have taken RTD since 1978. Only stopped during co-vid and have not started again. Concerns are
park-n-ride safety and union station. Otherwise I feel RTD does a great job.
I like how often the rides are.
Like the "spin the wheel" that they added, like the ambiance and info that is given out. Like the offers
that are given out as well
Love it! No more local/regional fares is a great idea!
One flat rate would be nice so its not complicated
I want fare change for cheaper fares
Standard rate for everything It is very confusing
Fares and charges should be lowered for non-students and the youth. Youth/children should have
lower charges or even no charge at all depending on their ages. Children have no concept of traveling
and are often with their designated guardian or adult, which should be enough charge for their ride
alone.
Fare simplification would be benefit our region. We live between N-line 112th and 104th station and
it seems odd to change regions between the two. Using a local-only fare would allow us to use all
stations equally and benefit lower-income commuters in the higher density areas north of 104th

Attachment: Attachment B - Title VI Fare Equity Analysis Report (4791 : Title VI Fare Equity Analysis)

The goal of a fare structure that's easy to understand and affordable for all is spot on. A simple and
affordable fare structure by default should be equitable too. The youth population would be well
served by the improvements. The Zero Fare for Youth proposal is most promising not only as a
method to increase access to the transit system and promote transit in the near term but also to
cultivate future patrons of public transportation. Many thanks to RTD staff for conducting this
exhaustive study.
Really good and helpful survey
Charges for riding the RTD bus, being a student is fair however can have safety concerns regarding the
bus in general. Generally, I feel and agree with the study's decisions to have a reward system for
frequent users, no fees for children and better discounts for elderly or even vet. Children under the
ages of 5 or 6 should not be charged or have a significantly lower fee due to their age. A rewards
system would not only benefit present users but also encourage more people to use public
transportation frequently.
RTD is really helpful for people with no transportation.
Its really helpful for people with no transportation.
I cant tole feeling unsafe on the 4te anymorer
The new recommendations are needed and appreciated
Make regional pass be for more than 1 day
Reduce fare is great IDEA- For Retirees
The transportation in certain neighborhoods where people of color live is decreasing in availability the
RTD board should look at studying the lack of access they are providing to people of color in a lower
economic bracket.
I really like taking public transportation but I don't like going to Union Station Because of the
homeless people. They should only allow people using public transportation to enter the building.
Otherwise its great to get around.
Can you get the 10 bus to Aurora CO. It was going over there. Now it don't.
I have an elderly mother 95 who I take with me on excursions for fun and stimulis. The ride you offer
is great but I could do it more with lower fares. My sister-in-law was mentally challeneged and she
rode your ride daily. It was a life saver! Thank you. Esther
I agree with the statement
Bus Passes are Reasonabily Prices (114) - SAVES Money. ECO Pass Available for ECE-Catholic
Charities? Please look into it.
Fare pricing needs to be controlled to allow access to all income levels!
I needed to ride RTD for work 2010-2015. I was living on less than $20K /year. Every dollar counted.
Someone in the position I was in needs the change in fare. I'm all for it.
I would like to see the fare on RTD be lowered to help people that can't afford the fares as they are
structured today. Veterans should have a discount, students, the over 55 riders. Thanks. PS: RTD
should also make a way to give jobs to people that have bad things happened to them and give them
a second chance at life. God's giving us a second chance. :)
I think it’s a great idea
All riders should pay something, the "No-cost transit for youth ages 19 and under through the Zero
Fare for Youth pilot" will encourage vandalism and will impose rider safety issues from violence from
under 19 riders.

Attachment: Attachment B - Title VI Fare Equity Analysis Report (4791 : Title VI Fare Equity Analysis)

Overall, the recommended fare structure goes a long way towards making RTD more affordable and
easier to use. However, increasing the time window for a single fare from three to four hours would
make it a more appealing and useful option for riders. With the current three hour travel window,
many riders are forced to purchase a second fare due to traffic congestion, transit delays and other
circumstances. A longer travel window would give riders more of a time buffer against delays to
complete their trip. This would make the fare a more practical alternative to a day pass for riders
wishing to go to a single destination, such as a medical appointment, grocery shopping or other
errand. Therefore, while the proposed regional and monthly pass rates as well as the consolidation
of the local and regional pricing helps encourage commuters to ride RTD for long distance trips, more
could be done to make public transit more compelling for shorter trips. A lower priced base fare or a
longer travel window would encourage more people to choose RTD for local errands and
appointments.
I like the streamlined pricing. I think this is a step in the right direction for more equity with ridership.
I feel there's a real need for customers to feel safe before you can bring back customers to riding
more. Once we have established safety I think proceeding with more routes, particularly at rush hour
times. It seems we've taken away routes instead of adding.
I frequently visit a good friend in Collinsville, Illinois. That is 29 miles from the airport (but not the end
of the line, which is Scott Air Force Base. From the airport to Scott AFB is $2 for seniors. The return
trip fare is based on the station where I board the train. My 29 mile ticket is $1.25.
The recommended fair is still too excessive if you consider someone who works at the airport has to
pay $10 one way per day equaling over $300 a month. I own a car and would like often to take the
train instead but it's cheaper to drive the car even at the gas prices as high as they are today. Because
the stops are so close together the regional ticket should be abolished and that should just be all local
there's nothing that far apart in the metro area. In Dallas you can go between Dallas and fort Worth
for $10 all day long on a day pass on the train you can also have an option on the bus to buy a day
pass for just double the single ride pass and it lasts all day. The reduction of the tickets you have
proposed are literally 25 cent less or 50 cents less not substantial enough to make a difference the
$88 a month pass seems to be the best option but many low income people are not able to come up
with $88 at one time. A weekly pass maybe a good alternative thank you.
I think this fare structure is a really good choice. Standardizing fares for all non-airport journeys
should have positive effects on ridership. And the reduction in price for monthly passes is a great idea
from both a ridership and equity perspective. These changes need to be implemented as soon as
possible.
Please include all students who are registered/enrolled in high school in the pilot program for free
RTD access (this includes students with disabilities who are over the age of 19 but are still enrolled in
public school)
Charge what you like. I can't afford to become a drug addict by riding your vehicles.
I like the proposal, I feel like it would encourage me to ride the commuter rail more often.
I am someone who mostly uses transit to get downtown for leisure activities (I work in the
neighborhood I live in). But the Zero Fare for Youth pilot program really excites me. Right now my son
is 3, and I find it reasonable to pay for a ticket for myself and take him for free on a visit to downtown.
But I've already thought that I wouldn't be as likely to do so after he gets older and passes the age
limit to ride for free. And after we have a second kid, whoo! Definitely wouldn't see that as an
inexpensive way to get around. I love the idea of increasing the age limit for youth to ride free. It
would greatly increase my likelihood of continuing to use public transit.
Hello. I am over 65 and occasionally use RTD. I like having one fare for all zones. Also, and this may
sound strange, but I think the discounted fares for seniors are too generous. For me to go to the
airport for only 1.35 is amazing. Great for us, but a loss of revenue for RTD.

I don’t mind about the cost of the fares so long as we, the riding public, are safe on the bus and trains.
What needs to be addressed is the safety and welfare of everyone. I have witnessed people doing
drugs inside the train and the filth left by those who have nothing to lose in life. While law abiding
people are like zombies inside - not moving for fear of their own safety. I have seen the decline of
paying and law abiding public riders because of this mess. Even RTD employees are saying they won’t
allow their family to ride public transport anymore. Police visibility is key. It pains me so much to say
that this is no longer the RTD I used to know. I feel sorry for the situation it is in now. Thank you.
nope
I very much support the simplification of the fare structure. Hopefully it will make all users more
inclined to use RTC and for RTD to then enhance (increase) service along key corridors to at least
every 15 minute frequency. I appreciate that outlying counties pay for service (and deserve it), but
we really do need to focus on the everyday trunk line service instead of commuter service. I hope
that these economical pricing tiers make that more feasible for more people. I particularly like the
$88/monthly pass as that seems more likely to be purchased as a "nice to have" option even for
someone that may commute by car a few times/week. I think the fare capping is great, but probably
needs to be explained a few times (and doesn't work with cash), so distribution of farecards may be a
good promotion even if they only have one ride pre-loaded (but the card is reloadable).
I would bet that the August month last year when there was no fee to ride transit went over well. I
think it would be good to try a Transit Week several times during the year. Get companies with staff
working downtown to get a break. Also, the buses, such as Number 10, Number 0, the Mall Shuttle
all have maintenance issues--have you travelled on some of these buses yourselves??? I would guess
Number 15 is the same way. Thanks for listening.
The proposed fare change is a good idea for all
After learning that the RTD My Card and app can be synced, I had to spend quite some browsing and
searching Google/RTD for info on the app. Finally found the section and ordered the card. There
needs to be more education on where to get the card and how to sync it. Phones do die and this is a
great alternative for when you don't have your phone and or don't want to carry. Also if buying
through the card/ app maxes out at the monthly pass price under the new structure. Why can't that
be implemented now even under the current structure???
Registering my support for the new fare structure. As a Boulder resident, I know that lower regional
fares will make me use RTD *more* often to get to and from Denver. I am also in support of any
policy that makes public transit more accessible to low-income residents and visitors.
I think it should be similar to how Minneapolis does it. Plus no extra fare to get to the airport. Not
every employer pays for an Eco pass, or for parking, and it can get expensive for employees who work
there.
The proposed fare structure is still too expensive. RTD should lower it's fares even further to assist
low-income riders, disadvantaged communities and the environment.
As a senior citizen who has a disability and mainly uses public transportation, RTD, I am very grateful
to l those who have worked tirelessly to create the new fare structure. Since I live on my Social
Security checks my income is set and with 1) so many services 2) rent 3) food 4) medicines and 5)
phone use going up, RTD'S efforts to show kindness and consideration to populations such as mine is
a Godsend. I also live in a virtual food desert so a walk doesn't get me to a viable grocery store. I
believe this will help many people in the Denver Metro area and beyond. Thank you for your
extensive work! I'm definitely a fan of RTD!
The new fare structure would be great,and more affordable.

Attachment: Attachment B - Title VI Fare Equity Analysis Report (4791 : Title VI Fare Equity Analysis)

I highly recommend this fare structure! RTD's fares are some of the highest in the country and do not
provide value for money in my opinion. I commute to the airport 5 days a week, and the new monthly
pass cost would make it much more feasible for me to take the train almost every day. In addition
to the new fare structure, I also recommend that RTD implement 3 and 7 day passes, like many other
transit systems have. This will make it more affordable for visitors to the Denver metro to travel by
transit rather than having to Uber/Lyft or rent a car.
Good revision to the fare structure. Easy to understand and simple to follow.
While the no cost fare idea for Youth may seem attractive, experience elsewhere demonstrates that
some youth will choose to simply board RTD for a frolic or, worse, to annoy or harass other
passengers. Large city transit (NYC, Phila, LA, etc) companies are having significant problems with
youth, including gangs and delinquents who prey upon other riders, occupy handicapped seating and
generally engage in boisterous or disrespectful conduct; regrettably this is fact in 2023. (Look at
experience on Mall Shuttles , Union Station, etc). RTD needs to charge all riders some fare -even if
modest or nominal - to preserve the ability of bona fide users from joy riders, etc. If this is ignored, no
one will choose to ride RTD and subject himself or herself to annoyance and harassment.
Your pricing structure for ECO passes does not make sense. You charge companies a flat price based
upon number of employees regardless if they would use the program or not. If this is not intended,
this is exactly how your contract is interpreted. For instance, one of the largest locations for
employment is the airport (over 35,000 employees). Airlines refuse to buy into the ECO program
because you are charging almost $60.00 per month, per employee that they have (not that are local).
Based upon the definitions of ECO pass pricing, they have 1000's of employees across their companies
(not all local) so most of what they are charged for could never participate. Therefore, you are
missing some of the largest employers in the region (remember that + 35,000 employees at the
airport) because it is cost prohibitive for them to offer such a benefit; especially when parking only
costs $36.00 per month for employees. Why be overcharged due to out of state employees and also
pay almost $60.00 per employee, when they may pay $36.00 to the city for parking? With your
current pricing structure you are missing great opportunity for the very large employers such as
airlines and concessions. Make it simple and offer a blanket cost for SIDA badged employees at the
airport that is competitive to the $36.00 per month parking fee).
I am hugely disappointed in the lack of innovation and creativity in this study. I was expecting a
refresh in fare structure, including at least considering the possibility of abolishing the 3-hour pass
that no one likes; and all we got for regular fares is a 25-cent discount and no more regional level??
Did you know that Denver has one of the most expensive transit systems in the country? It is cheaper
to drive a family of 5 to the airport and park there than it is to take the train--one way! In every other
city I have lived in, fare is based on how far you're traveling, not a fixed (and very high) price. If I am
taking a bus 5 stops down the road, why the heck am I paying 3 dollars?? Sorry, $2.75. In other cities
that would cost me a dollar, maybe less. This study was a wonderful opportunity, and it was
completely wasted. Shame on you, RTD.
Of course I think the new fare structure looks great - simplified and much cheaper. But however will
you meet operating costs at those rates? We are not low-income, but I always do keep in mind how
to help low-income people - while high earners can afford more. High earners should pay more, but
less than it would cost drivers to park downtown. Many corporate jobs with good benefits offer
transit pay, e.g. I used to receive $65 a month to offset the cost of taking mass transit. $6 for a day
pass is perfectly reasonable. For the monthly pass, there should be two rates - one regular at $200
per month, then a $90 one for low-income or airport employees. For people using the A line just for
travel - make it more expensive, but less than getting a cab/Uber ride or paying for parking. e.g. I'd
pay $20 for a round trip to the airport when traveling. (However I DON'T use RTD to go the airport
because I don't trust the train to actually get me there / on time to make my flight.) I realize you can't

rescind these low prices after you've publicized them, but obviously if you couldn't be profitable at
the current rates - you're definitely going to be in the red with these rates that are lower than they
need to be.

Excellent! The new simplified approach and thoughtful and appropriate discounts should really
motivate more people to use RTD!
Hello. I voted for light rail and am a believer and user of public transportation around the world……as
long as I feel safe on it. I DO FEEL SAFE ON THIS LIGHT RAIL SYSTEM! I used to, but I no longer do!!! I
am very disappointed on how it is being overseen. There needs to be consistent security on the trains
and at the stations! I stopped using light rail after too many encounters with a lot of the passengers
struggling with mental illness, homeless riding it to stay warm, out of control youth and drug users. It
is an absolute shame and something needs to change before I will go back to using it in our city.
Senior citizen fares should be less than 50% of full fares. Also, because of safety concerns for the very
elderly, consider free transit for anyone 75 years of age or older using public RTD services.
This is great! I think it simplifies a lot of things while encouraging an interest in use.
The people that are using the RTD system, need better prices and easy access to buses and train
Please reduce the day pass to $5! Also, the light rail feels unsafe at times. Is there a way to increase
the presence of RTD staff or security especially at Union Station?
The fare changes will help so many individuals that rely on public transportation. Our non-profit will
be able to help more clients with the lower fare rates. Especially monthly passes. I like the idea of the
youth not having to worry about having money to get to school, work, and home. It may help some
avoid having to choose between bus fare or eating that day. It can help the kid who is forced to take
the bus, but can barely afford it. Everything is getting more expensive, and would be helpful for our
community to not worry about affording public transportation.
Good job
I don't ride the bus
I don't catch the bus
Please start enforcing the fares. It is pathetic how many homeless and drug addicts just hop on these
trains and buses and move around freely wherever they please around the Denver area. You wouldn’t
need to increase the fares constantly if there was enforcement. People living in the outskirts of town
aren’t going to ride the light rail if they don’t feel safe and all that recent expansion will be for
nothing. Enforcement is absolutely necessary.
Its cool
Riders from N Line 124th Eastlake Station waited a long time for the train while paying taxes toward
the project, then were penalized with higher fares. Abolishing higher fare zone ends confusion about
fares and makes fares fair for all riders
nothing
fundamentally REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION is inequitable and impacts most of all indigent people
trying to go to and from appointments, work and take care of families, but also, people who have
fixed incomes. For all of these people the transit needs to be more robust and free. The inequities of
not being able to live on the corridors of the transit system and for people, like myself, who use
bicycles the RTD system and its connections are fraught with limits and scheduling where to catch the
trains making connections for outlying areas is unwieldy. We need a cross-section of transit options
that accommodate people who have medical and mental challenges. IF we really want to make transit

I completely support the recommended fare structure.
I love this idea! As someone who rides RTD a lot, there are times I forget my pass. I shouldn’t but I do.
Having better pricing takes it off of my mind about having to think about how far I’m going. Or if I
need to bump up my fare. Very helpful!

I like the prices. Are babies free. I have to bring my baby and I hope I don't have to pay extra for her.

These fares will make me take the bus more. It is a lot cheaper which is good because I have a lot of

There should be a fare for people who are disabled that is better than these. Focus said I can still get

The new fares are great. It makes it easier to get around between towns. Thank you.
I go from Boulder and Longmont a lot so I really like the regional fare. The bus is free in Longmont so
that doesn't matter much to me.
I don't really take the bus in Boulder. I like the light rail in Denver. If the bus and light rail changes are

I really like the regional price.
I agree that the fares are a better fit for people riding the buses & trains
Please clean up the trains. They do not feel safe since they are rarely patroled and the fabric seats are
disgusting germ factories. Tired of people smoking pot/cigarettes/cigars on the train. I will drive and
sit in traffic because I do not feel safe and the trains are disgusting.
You should like, destroy most of the R line and re-do it. All the other lines go fast because they go
straighter. The R Line sucks because there’s like a bunch of tight curves or whatever. It’d be a lot
cooler if it followed the freeway and went faster n stuff. You could still use the old tracks that you’ve
already built; just turn it into a trolley or something and build a new track between Colfax and Florida
for a properly fast light rail. Also you could add a stop next to the In n’ Out Burger, that would be cool.
I like the new fare structure it's so much easier to understand I just hope that if you get increased
riders you do ensure people are paying and not using it as a moving homeless encampment.

I think RTD is changing people's lives within the community. I am thankful for the beneficial free fares
for our youth. I know a few kids that need this so much! This will help them succeed. Thank you RTD.
As a parent with two kids, free youth fares would encourage us to ride the train more often. The
additional cost of paying for the whole family makes it more expensive than parking, so we usually
drive. We are season pass holders at Elitches, so this would definitely be useful for us.
I live near Green Valley Ranch and my work is on Jackson Gap Rd. The area has more warehouses and
factories but they are having trouble staffing because there are no transit options. Would like if they
expanded the 42 or 45.
As a senior living in the Baker neighborhood, fervent about traffic/pollution/transportation issues in
Denver, I fully support lowering prices for monthly RTD passes. Let's make ridership accessible and
affordable for all, and reduce car traffic!
Like the idea of creating a monthly pass that encourages regular use including airports. Also like the
social equity aspect of the Live program.
I like the proposed fare reduction and simplification. $1.35 fare doesn't make sense for low income make it a whole $ amount.
I want to see the transit system continue to grow and connect communities. We need more routes,
decreased fare, cleanliness and safety measures increased for Colorado (Denver) transit system.
These changes to the economic system is so great and creates a more accessible community and will
ultimately help the environment!
As a student who doesn't have a car, these changes are fantastic! I'll be more able to get to work.
Love this! Making public transportation as accessible as possible financially is huge and helps people
have more economic opportunities.
I think it's mucho bien. I'm 64 and there's not a lot of work and it would be good to do that. I live in
Denver.
This will be good for a lot of people who're disabled and don't have a lot of money. I'm surprised it
was so expensive.
I ride the buses a lot and me and my wife are on SSDI and the cost of what it was was way too
expensive. A cheaper pass means we can put it to something else.
I take the bus every other day. I'd much rather have it cheaper because the fare seems like it goes up
and the town halls feel useless. This should help people take the bus more but I would like to see it
lower.
I like it! Thanks :)
Overall, I support the new proposed fares. The best change is the Regional monthly pass fee. This will
help many achieve access. The minimal reduction in single adult fare is not as good. Still room for
improvement there to help our community achieve access to public transportation.
I live in Broomfield and needed to commute to both Boulder and now Denver for the 4 years I have
lived here. Many times I have considered and honestly dreamed of using public transportation, but
driving has always been more timely. Now that I work close to Union Station, I am again interested in
using public transportation. The new fare structure would make it much more appealing for someone
like me, who lives in the suburbs to use the bus. Even though the time it takes to get to work may not
change due to these policies, the reduction in fare rates makes it much more worth the time. I wish
Colorado could be a leader for the country when it comes to public transportation and though we
have a long way to go, these new fares, policies, and changes that create greater accessibility for
those in need, is certainly a step in the right direction.
I think these lower fares would be very helpful for people like my wife and myself.

The 3-hour window should be increased to 4. When I go to the Performing Arts Complex I end up
having to pay a fair both ways because the window is not long enough. At this point it almost makes it
non practical because I could just drive down there and pay for parking for a couple bucks more
I ride the bus to and from work and think the amount to ride is a little expensive, the proposed
amount would be great.
The reduce rate of Live will help so much on bringing in more riders weekly, if not daily, for even
individuals on fixed income.
I am all for the proposed fare structure change and think that free fare for youth will greatly increase
use and accessibility for many many people
I am in support of the proposed structures. I wish there was Apple Pay.
I am all for a lower fare for the bus considering it is the daily commute of my daughter to and from
school. Also the free youth fare for a year is an awesome idea to bring youth out into the community
and around the city
I appreciate the reduced fares and actually think they should be free. If they are simplified, I think
they should be rounded to $2 for a few hours and $5 for all day.
Elimination of zones is so smart! We have to do that. Good on ya

I believe public transit should be free for all. Anyone that rides public transit is doing thw world a
favor. Less cars on the road. Less gas consumed. This should be rewarded with free fare. Its not a
handout. Its a way if life and it is helping preserve the world.
Support the lower rate of bus passes. Would like to see more light rail.
Cheaper fare
So more people can benefit. Also maybe more working people will once again take this
transportation. I am now concerned about taking it because there is so much violence
Bring back the 16L!!!!!
If you really want more people to ride RTD, I would suggest a fare-free month. Then more people will
ride and enjoy the trip.
I think the new fare structure seems much more simple and I am excited that youth will ride free and
costs across the board are decreasing a bit!
Please lower the fare structure to 19 and younger free...thank you
I agree with lower fare prices
Love the simplified fare structure and that kids ride for free. Thanks for supporting families!
Reducing fares, especially monthly passes, makes using RTD much more likely. Reduced local fares
while keeping airport fares up seems smart. PLEASE give free fares to youth to promote transit usage
at a young age
Appreciate the reduction in monthly pass amount. Great work
Make riding safer by removing non paying riders that do drugs on the train
Love the changes, and how it will be less confusing!
Love the reduced monthly pass cost but please bring the discount 3-hour pass cost down to $1.00 and
daily pass cost down to $2.00 as RTD does not give change. This will help make RTD truly affordable
for people who need it most! Thank you.

It's about time fares came down. RTD was my only mode of transit other than my bike for years and i
would watch the fares go up while quality of service and serice in general decreased or remained the
same. I remember when fare for a monthly pass was under $100 dollars and it was affordable then.
After Covid hit there were service interruptions as was to be expected, and the busses and trains
began running on a weekend schedule which meant some routes were and lines were no longer
running, (such as the 122X) but the worst part about it was over a year later service was still
structured like this with no plans foreseeable to return to normal schedules, and yet fares remained
unchanged. Many riders, myself included felt outrage at this. Not only had we seen a steady annual
increase in fares and a drop in services anyway, how could RTD in good faith be audacious enough to
continue to charge it's riders a full fair when they weren't providing the whole service to its riders?
Inwas paying $114 dollars per month for what? Maybe 3/4 of the use routes and lines offered. RTD
really dropped the ball on that one and for the first time in my ridership did I feel like I was getting
taken by RTD. I hope this plan goes through, and prices do come down. The riders are owed at least
that much.
Why not set the age for Senior Fare to 60 or 62 ? Many seniors take Social Security at 62 and are
retired.
What would the rates for seniors be
Really hope the bus fare can go down xoxo
I am concerned about the under 19 free fare, basically a good idea but might encourage delinquent
kids to act out, commit crimes in places outside their neighborhood if they could just get on
wherever.
Homelessness and crime.
Lower fares for low income/disabled and also free fares for children ages 19 & under would be
beneficial to our community
I see two significant problems with the proposed fare structure: 1. $10/person each way to the
airport, which is $40 R/T for a couple plus $2/day parking, keeps private vehicles and off-site parking
an attractive option. For a family of 4, $80 plus parking. The Airport should cost the same as regional
fares. 2. The flat $2.75 fare has people living in higher density areas--a responsible decision--and
taking short RTD trips subsidizing those living in low-density exhurbs. Philosophically, this is
backwards, but has always been the failing of RTD: its focus on moving people around the suburbs.
Everyone needs equal opportunity
SEIU Local 105 represents over 8,000 members across the Denver Metro Area, the state of Colorado
and the Mountain West. This comment is specifically made on behalf of our Denver Metro Area
members that have difficulty affording and finding accessible transportation to and from their jobs.
Our main concern is that the companies that directly and indirectly employ our members say that the
Eco-Pass benefit some of them provide is too expensive. Although SEIU Local 105 welcomes the
proposed fare structure for businesses, it may still fall short to satiate the need for a better public
transportation experience. This is especially true for areas that currently are far away from major
populated centers, like Denver International Airport (DEN). But the need for a better RTD service is
also true for our 2,500 janitorial members that clean office spaces across the Denver Metro Region.
Most of this work is performed after working hours, when schedules are sparse, presenting a major
difficulty for our members to get back to their loved ones. The issue of high costs for the EcoPass for
employers is also at play. Given these two examples, DEN and the Downtown area and metropolitan
suburbs, SEIU Local 105, strongly encourages RTD to look into creating special incentive zones similar
to what other cities have enacted, including in our own backyard: Boulder. The City of Boulder
Community Vitality Commercial District, where businesses within a certain geographic area are
automatically part of a program where their employees receive a free Eco Pass, is a prime example of

what RTD could accomplish for DEN and the main commuting regions within Metro Denver. Another
idea we welcome, specifically to the DEN workforce, is creating a system of free employee-only
shuttles to and from the airport, connecting with the A-Line, that should also be free to DEN workers.
Airports around the world have a dedicated transportation system for their employees and as a
world-class airport, DEN, RTD and the airlines should work together to study the viability of this
alternative. SEIU Local 105 has also heard about RTD’s conversation to create a master
transportation contract with the airlines at DEN. This master contract should include the contractors
and sub-contractors that provide services to the airlines. Designing a program that excludes the
workers that, through other vendors, directly and indirectly, support the airlines, is a program
destined to fail. Our union looks forward to engaging RTD, DEN, the airlines and other regional and
city government officials to provide additional input and testimony on why contractors and
subcontractors of airlines need to be included in any master airline transportation contract. It is
crucial that fare policies and programs are regularly evaluated and adjusted as needed to ensure that
they continue to meet the needs of workers and low-income riders. If we all want to make Denver
and the Denver Metro Area more green and accessible in terms of jobs, housing and basic needs, we
need to find ways to improve and fix the public transportation grid. Ultimately, by prioritizing the
zones of greater usage within populated centers, but also in far away regions like DEN, RTD can create
a more inclusive and efficient transportation system that benefits everyone in our community. I urge
you to carefully consider SEIU Local 105’s recommendations and to work towards creating a more
equitable and accessible public transportation system in the Denver Metro Area.
Looks great! Much simpler and will really help low income families! Looking forward to the new rail
line to Boulder/Longmont. Hope there is a stop in Gunbarrel!
I really like the simplicity of the new fare structure. I think it will help riders understand it better.
While I appreciate the lowered fares, that personally doesn’t impact me as much. But grouping the
local/ regional together is very helpful.
I just think there should be lowered it's really outrageous to have to commute when a lot of people
are still feeling the covid stuff and it's hard for people to come up with the money for a bus and get
from here to there my self I get help from the empowerment group with bus passes but it's before
that I would have to constantly try to figure out how to get bus where I needed to go so if you guys
would make a structure it's a little bit lower the people could reach for people that are in the lower
income phase or like you said discounted that would be awesome I need to start helping the people
more thank you very much for your time
Bus are very unstable especially on weekend. Bus route is to long especially on the 76-Wadsworth
especially when it snows. We have to wait on 3 or 4 hrs for the Bus. No real back up on the routes.
We have to wait 3 or 4 hrs for an asser ride and back up driver - for when they breakdown call from
dispatch to let us is the bus is running down. Why don't you will try a volunteer dispatch service for
someone closer the call instead of having a customer waiting 4 or 4 hours.
I strongly support the streamlining of RTD’s fare policy, and appreciate greatly the decreased cost of
both individual fares and monthly passes!
Being elderly and disabled and on a fixed income, it is hard to make ends meet as it is. It would be
greatly appreciated if I didn't have to pay so much to ride the bus, which gives me access to my
community and various, much needed, resources. Respectfully, Donna
Thank you for simplifying the fare structure for everyday work commuter, such as myself. It might be
too complicated but I'd love to find out how you all applied a fare equity analysis to this process.
I'm thrilled to see an $88 monthly pass. Between the reduced price and fare capping, it makes the
decision to take RTD instead of driving a no-brainer. The simplification and price reductions of the
employer pass programs will make it easier for employees to talk about starting a pass program with

the proposed fee plan, I will be able to pay $1.35 for the bus and get a free transfer to take the train

It seems to me that the proposed fair structure is much more fair and easier to understand. I am very
much in favor of expanding the access and discount fair program.
I don't ride the bus very much but I will take it more now. I like the regional all day price. The local is
better also
I buy the monthly pass regional/airport. Currently it takes me 20 commutes per month for the
monthly pass to pay off. Some months I don't meet that threshold. Under the new structure, it would
take me 9 commutes. This is such a vast improvement for me and would conjure no hesitation in my
monthly pass purchase. The monthly pass encourages me to ride RTD even when I "need" to, so
cheaper monthly passes would be a plus all around!
I believe that the fares prices should be much lower. A majority of people who use the public
transport systems are lower income folks, and it doesn't make sense to charge so much. Reducing
prices ensures equity of the public transport system. Reducing prices will also increase the number of
folks who use it, reducing our green house gas emissions in Denver.
The regional for the day is the best price.
These prices are great especially the regional. I think the bus should be free for veterans but these
prices are good for everybody else.
I wish it was all free for people with bad health. We have to take the bus a lot for our medical stuff.

The regional price is the best. I have to go from Boulder to Longmont a lot so this saves me money
since the local is free in Longmont
Absolutely appreciate the effort to bring equity to RTD. Cannot wait to see the positive impact these
fare changes will bring to the communities of Colorado. When I was younger I relied on the light rail

bringing to CO. Great work to all the people involved in these changes.
I really like the local one. I can take the bus more now.
Looking forward to the new rates to share w/ people.
The regional price is good
This is too much. I am homeless and I can't pay this. The bus should be free if you are homeless.
I like the new changes RTD is proposing in order to create more equitable opportunities in bus fares
for all citizens in RTD's area of work. I like the proposal of making local/regional fares the same price,
and I like the idea of youth bus fares being free.
These prices are good. Now I don't have to ride my bike that much.
I'm glad the price is lower. Is it lower for older people too? I am older and I like senior discounts
The price is good for the regional. Too much for local
All public transit should be free. Travel is a right of the people.
I would love for my grandma as she gets older and for me to be able to ride the bus for cheaper prices
especially for those in my community who need rides.
I don't take the bus but if I do I like these prices.
I think the bus should be free for people that are homeless
As someone who has been closely following the issues w/ fare structures specifically impacting our
clientel (parolees), I can confidently say that the changes being proposed will have a profoundly
positive impact on our community particularly for nonprofits and low income around the city. I was
especially pleased to see the inclusion of the 10% bulk discount; This will help many organizations
save money in the long run. I also believe that this change will make a real difference for those who
have been struggling to afford transportation in the region. Overall, I want to commend the
decision-makers involved for their thoughtful and forward -thinking approach to these issues. It is
clear that those involved have carefully considered the needs of the community and nonprofits and I
am confident that the proposed changes will be felt by many in a truly meaningful way.
I like the new price.
It should be cheaper for people with disabilities. I can't walk and I have to take the bus but I can't
work so the bus is a lot.
I like the cheaper regional. I hope the drivers have change.
I like the structure but I don't understand why local isn't free everywhere. Longmont has free local
buses
$88 still to high to encourage people to leave their vehicles and use more public transportation and
reduce carbon emissions
Equity, and more importantly justice, would be free transit for all. It removes barriers to access.
Reduces stress and anxiety for those most impacted by not expose people to invasive application
processes. Reduces overhead costs of managing upwards of 15 different fare products/structures.
Increases ridership as shown by fare free August 2022. Please end fares and find funding from other

As a long time RTD rider, this recommended fare structure is highly attractive and I hope it passes.
With the delays & frequent cancelations on the A-line, the new monthly fare would make it more
affordability to those moving about in the city who need to find last minute (and sometimes higher
rates on busy/peak ride share) options to get around. Thank you for your consideration.
I DEPEND ON RTD AND RESPECT THEM
The recommended fare structure both simplifies the fare system and lowers fares, making it a great
solution. It will help drive equity as well as higher transit use. A simpler system also will encourage
more tourists and other visitors to use transit as it is not as confusing to have to try to figure out what
zones they will be traveling in.
I support Title V1
Enthusiastic support for fare reductions to improve access! The current fee structure doesn't work
economically, even against downtown parking costs! The new structure will make it much more
accessible to commuters and those who rely on public transportation as their primary mode of
transportation.
I'm not sure if this idea has been discussed, but I wanted to mention it while I had a moment. I've
been a driver for 4+ years, so I have many thoughts about how things could be improved. Relating to
the fares though, I think making a 1-way trip without a transfer should only cost $1. It's not fair to
charge $3 to a passenger that's going 2 miles down the road to get home and also $3 for a passenger
that's going to ride for 40 min, switch busses and ride another half hour. It just doesn't make sense
that both situations are the same fee. I hope this will be implemented.
The safety of our car and belongings at the park and ride (especially 40th) is in danger. I know many
people that got their car stolen or/and broken into multiple times. Insurance doesn’t even cover the
damages. So we need RTD to work on making those parking spaces safe.
The train is always delayed, especially on Saturdays. After being delayed for an hour, the small train
comes and half of the people that have been waiting would not even fit which makes us all late to
work.
There are days I stay at the airport overnight because I miss the last train at 1 am. Most times, I would
be assigned a last-minute passenger and by the time I get the passenger to their destination, clock out
and make it to the train station, it is too late for me to catch the last train of the night, so I sleep in the
airport for the night.
I work for a low income community in north Denver, lower fairs and monthly passes would help out
my resident's greatly
This is an excellent first step to making RTD fares easier to use. RTD should work toward identifying
more non-fare sources of revenue, with the goal of eventually making the entire system fare-free.
Regarding the RTD LiVE Income Based Discount Program. I am pleased that this program is available
as it covers a large demographic not previously available with other discount fare programs. I'm
looking forward to proposed enhancements possibly coming in the future to LiVE. One feedback I
would like to give is for the reloadable MyRide card for the LiVE program. This is a great option for
many people that are unable to use the MyRide mobile ticketing app. either because they do not have
access to a mobile phone, on-line options and do not have or cannot obtain a debit or credit card to
use for payment and need to use cash. The MyRide card is a good alternative however it can only be
reloaded at an RTD Sales Outlet which severely limits their ability to reload the card as there are only
a few locations available to do this. Their needs to be more access available for people in the
community that must use cash to reload their cards. Grocery stores or convenience stores would be a
good option for these folks. Thanks for all you do with the discount fare programs.

Appreciate the simplicity of the new fee structure and commitment to accessibility for all riders. Well
done and thank you!
This is a great step in the right direction but does not go far enough with the airport fare. If you travel
with one other person it is likely to be the same price to Uber vs taking the train. The airport train
should be THE way to get to and from but if it costs $10 per person people will remain opposed to
using it. The barrier to entry is barely too high. Including it in the monthly pass is a great addition,
however. I do very much appreciate the combination of local and regional into a lower price. This
makes it much simpler to use!
I think they're a lot of work to be done in outreach letting people know about the discounts offered. I
like the idea of grocery stores, food banks and libraries having info and retail options for purchasing
these passes. They should have big obvious signs talking about the discount programs and how you
can buy tickets and passes there. Also the app needs a lot of work. There should be accurate location
data on the busses and trains whereabouts, how early or late they are so they can provide riders with
accurate ETAs. I can't rely on the busses downtown to be in time so that I can make my connection. I
missed two connections today and was late to work! That's not my fault but it looks like a terrible
excuse to my employer! Please address the timeliness of busses, they either arrive late or leave too
early, I've experienced both situations and it's ridiculous. The operators need to stick to a strict
schedule for the rider's sake!
Hi, I want to voice my support for the reduced cost of fares and passes, free fare for youths, and the
expansion of the LIVE discount. I think these changes are a great start to changing car dependence in
Denver and a step in the right direction for reducing greenhouse gases. This seems to be one of the
first real actions I've seen that can reduce emissions and I want to applaud the proposed changes and
people making it happen. I think this will increase ridership and make transit an option for more
people and for families that want to use transit. Lowering fares is a great way to encourage more
people to get out of their single occupant vehicles and use transit. I've used RTD buses and rail for 10
years and have seen a wide variety of people and interactions. I have never felt threatened or fearful
using transit unlike the feelings I get when driving with so many aggressive, arrogant, careless motor
vehicle operators. We need systemic change to dismantle car dependency and violence and this is a
great step. Thanks and keep up the good work on increasing transit use and decreasing carbon
emissions.
My husband and I are in our seventies and so appreciate that we are close to the light rail and buses.
We don’t have to pay to park and most of the places we visit are within walking distance. Thanks.
This new fare structure seems very equitable and smart. I think it will have almost only positive
impacts. Thank you
As a member of a group that advocates for the unsheltered and under-served, this program would
mean a lot to our clients. It would make it possible to avoid fines, keep their things, get medical help,
visit shelters and food banks, and find housing and jobs. It would help to remove some of the unfair
burden carried by those who suffer in poverty. Changing the fare structure to reflect equity is not only
going to increase paid ridership, it is a moral responsibility to our most vulnerable.
Very much look forward to these changes! It’s far too expensive for airport employees to use transit
to the airport! Also, please work with the airlines to get passes offered to their employees at no-cost
to the employee!

I attended the May 16th Zoom meeting, and I don't think I received a thoughtful or serious answer to
my question - which was intended to be constructive. Someone else in the chat asked about the base
fare being $2.75 rather than an even $3.00. I wanted to explore how RTD's current fare collection
equipment could replicate what other systems do (MBTA, RFTA?) by printing a stored-value card that
could be used on a future ride. I asked what it would take for the bus printers to print something
other than transfers. The answer I received was essentially "the bus printers print three-hour passes
and day passes," and "our system can't do what you're asking." My apologies for using informal
terminology that people who ride your buses would use ("transfers") instead of terminology used by
people who work at 1660 Blake St. The answers I received didn't seem to have received much thought
from the staff member who answered. At a minimum, I would have expected a reply such as "we'd
need someone from our IT department or our fare media vendor to discuss that, and unfortunately,
they're not here at this meeting." Instead I got a message that "The host has removed you from the
web meeting" at the end of the hour - before this and another question of mine was answered.
I never received an answer to this question during the May 16 noon webinar: Regarding other agency
policies, such as Portland Tri-Met's option of a diversion by applying for the analog of RTD's LiVE
program as restitution for fare evasion (that is, instead of paying a fine or performing community
service - see https://trimet.org/fares/fareisfair.htm ), would this possibility need to be considered as
part of the Fare Equity Study or the separate Respect the Ride effort? I hope that since I wasn't able
to get an answer during the webinar that this topic can be covered in the study's final
recommendations.
Needs to be more affordable
I work as the homeless student liaison at a charter school. I was very excited to see a No-cost transit
for youth ages 19 and under. This will help so many students - low income and homeless.
Transportation to school is one of the barriers so many homeless students experience. By providing
transportation, RTD has increased students' ability to achieve their and their family's goal of
graduating. Thank you!
Currently Access-A-Ride customers may ride regular services for free. Will this continue?
I would like to advocate that McKinney-Vento Homeless students and families be categorically
exempt from income verification for the LiVE program and that school districts be allowed to be an
organizational partner where we can purchase bulk LiVE passes for this specific population. PEAK is a
barrier for our students and families. Please make LiVE passes available for purchase just like Local 10

I LOVE the idea of making RTD free for youth. Adolescents are seeking independence and need access
to mobility in order to transition into adulthood. Making this fare free would increase access to
school choice, promote access to after-school activities, and give teens the independence they are
craving and need to develop a healthy sense of self-sufficiency and self-agency.
This comment is unrelated to the changes to fares, etc. But this issue is much more important than
any of that. I used to be a daily rider of RTD. Due to increasing crime, mostly damage to cars at the
park-n-rides & the transients at Union Station, I (and my family) no longer use RTD. I used to be a big
proponent of RTD, defending the funding, tax increases, etc. I will no longer support RTD until you
take the crime problem seriously, and work with police to apprehend and convict all criminal activity
surrounding RTD properties.
I encourage you to adopt the new fare structure, especially the recommended discount fare structure
for people over 65, Medicare recipients and those with disabilities. It will make a huge impact in their

I believe the proposed plan would be good. It would make it easier and more affordable and by being

I feel that youth shoulde have free fares in order to attend school
All of these are a good idea.
I am so very excited about the new fare structure. I will definitely be riding the train and bus more
often once it is live. I absolutely think that the three pairs for all you should be extended beyond the
one-year pilot program. We need long-term investment in our youth and public transit. It is also kind
of strange to have bus fares be $1.35 because people don’t often Carey coins anymore. They should
definitely be rounded to the nearest whole dollar.
When I travel a single person j will take the bus/light rail to the airport. When it’s 2 or more of us
traveling to airport it is cheaper to pay for parking at dia vs round trip rail ($40 for 2 ppl) $30 for
parking.
Getting around with the bus is a really fun experience and this free for June thing for buses will really
help when I get to work and school
I think that we should have better bus stops and make bus stops easier to be at because having to
stand in the rain trying to get to school
These changes are ESSENTIAL for the people of Denver in providing public transportation for all! As a
bus rider myself the monthly pass decrease would be a game changer for me and allow me to access
more places that I otherwise wouldn’t be able to.
Location of transit is not convenient. Makes many last mile problems
We appreciate the current 70% discount off of full fares that youth currently receive. We purchase
10-pack ticket books for our kids to use when they ride the bus. However, sometimes they don't
anticipate needing to get home on their own and forget to bring their tickets when they are out.
Having a zero-fare program for youth would allow my kids to access public transportation whenever
they need it, rather than rely on a parent to pick them up in a car.
I'm an infrequent rider and will benefit hugely from these changes. Currently the monthly fare is
inaccessible to me and the new one would be affordable.
Can you please work with DIA to provide a discount for airport employees? The a.m. trains are FULL of
us & even with this proposed reduction, this is still a lot of $. I wanted to take the train daily to help
the environment, but it’s unfortunately cheaper for me to drive. Thank you!
I would be pleased if the monthly regional pass was reduced to 88$. One low price, one time
purchase would make my life convenient. I know several who would take the triai to DIA but
complain that the price is too high. I think ridership would increase with the new airport fare.
Thanks!
I'm very excited to see this simplified fare structure. Living in a local zone along a regional route, I
have previously been dinged by that change in fare. we need simplicity in our system to better
encourage more transit users. I'm also pleased to see more consistency amongst the discount fares as

The cheaper regional fare is the best part.
It should be free for homeless people or people with no money. I also hope you don't cut the routes.
I like that the regional and local day pass is less because I have to go to Longmont to work.
I hope you all still make money. It's nice that you're giving us a break.
Glad it is going to cost less money. My issue is the drivers kick me off if I don't have exact change. I
think the $2.75 will make the same problem for me and lots of others.
The bus should be free for local rides
I like the cheaper local fare but I hope the drivers will have change so they don't take an extra quarter
when I ride the bus.
I like these new fares because the monthly fare is less.
I’m writing to share my excitement and concerns about the proposed changes to the RTD fare and
pass structure. I’m happy RTD is simplifying the structure and reducing the cost for all riders but
especially frequent riders through the monthly pass. I’m also excited to see the free fares for youth
pilot program, and consolidation of the discount programs into one. I’m concerned about a few
barriers to true accessibility and affordability. The 3-hour passes, by requiring exact change, will mean
many folks who pay with cash on the bus will end up paying more. Additionally, I’d like RTD to remove
some of the requirements to qualify for discounted passes that prevent access for folks who need
transit accessibility the most. I’d also like RTD to prioritize finding funding for a permanent free fares
for youth program. These changes would make our transit system truly accessible and affordable. I
know these require increased funding, and I urge RTD to pursue partnerships with the state for these
changes. Additionally, see the success of the free fare programming both here in Denver/August,
and in other cities. I'm a firm advocate of making RTD fares completely free. It reflects the accurate
value system of our community members who rely most on these services, greener/cleaner/lower
congestion on our streets, and eliminates ALL of the cost and accountability of collecting fares at all.
Imagine how streamlined a system we could have if drivers were not at all concerned about collecting
fares, we didn't have to have officers screening for non-payment and risk unhealthy encounters, no
systems or procedures would need to be in place, screened, trained, reviewed, reciprocated in
accountability, etc. It would simply save more money than it brings in to charge $0 for all transit. I
urge you to adopt these changes, implement them as soon as possible, and keep pushing for state
funding to further improve the fare and pass structure toward affordability and equity to make our
transit system accessible for all. Thank you.
The fare structure looks more affordable and should allow more people to be able to access the rtd
services
I think it makes sense to not have a higher fee for those in lower cost of living areas (generally further
out) so mass transit is used more. I’m not sure I would lower the local fare though. Why not just leave
it the same? $3 (for 3 hrs) & $6 (for day) to have a slightly lower tax burden & “even” $ amounts.
Otherwise I like the ideas. Thanks!
Agree only if this change won’t affect the quality of the service. Right now is good. Keep it that way
I think that the new recommended fares are a great improvement. I have been using the RTD college
pass for a couple of years, but now that I'm graduating and losing access to that I have been trying to
figure out how to make my commute. The current monthly pass is far to expensive to justify purchase
for me but at a price point of $88 its far more reasonable and I would be more than likely to continue
to utilize RTD services for commutes. Thank you for taking the time to do this study and for the
potential of making RTD affordable for everyone! Best regards, Taylor Mundt

The Fee structure is still outrageous. I've been to dozens of other countries around the world and
these fares are laughable. If we want to move to mass transit, the costs need to be lower. Period.
Wake up.
The new fee structure appears more affordable for those groups of riders who actually depend on
public transportation. I especially believe that the reduce cost for regional and airport fares will
benefit the metro area as a whole with regard to reduced traffic and air pollution.
Riders 65 or older should ride free. They've paid RTD taxes for decades. Gets them off the road and
decarbonized too. Children should pay something. Teaches them that transportation costs $$$ and
isn't free. They learn the sting of paying taxes for RTD services. RTD must first ensure a safe, clean,
vagrant free riding experience before customers will return. RTD light rail is a fixed guideway system
designed to move passengers toward the center city. This is now an obsolete concept. Neighborhood
circulator buses should be stationed at each light rail stop to better service the local neighborhoods
rather than the central city. A once to twice per hour express light rail train should service the
downtown. This will require dispatching capabilities far above what RTD currently has. RTD
management needs reengineered. Far too many chiefs with far too few Indians, especially beat cops.
18 RTD Board members is ridiculous.
Please clean up your bus stop trash. Lafayette at Lucerne and Hwy 287 is piling up and blowing trash
all over Lafayette. Bad environmental impact by RTD.
I support the new fare structure. I would also support having someone check fares. I think those of
us that pay them are subsidizing a lot of riders who don't.
Why is the CEO salary so high?
I would like to see a monthly pass available to LiVE participants. Being on SNAP and unemployed I am
constantly on the bus all over the district for interviews and job searches.
I’m reviewing the new fare schedule there is no option for veteran discounts. As a disabled veteran
who requires the RTD A and R lines to make appointments at the hospital etc. I have to prove
disability. This is fine however I choose not to file for state disability, my injuries are a result of federal
service and only use Veterans Affairs for medical and disability. Currently RTD requires state disability
forms for disability discounts. My choice to “save money in the state pot” for others to use
automatically puts me in tougher financial positions and I receive no disability assistance on Bus/Rail
options. I have on numerous occasions, going back to 2020, been harassed by RTD security staff
because “I don’t look disabled.” My apologies RTD that disabilities are not appearance based as the
Americans with disabilities act would agree. RTD’s managerial incompetency is being taken out on
paying customers, shocking RTD can’t seem to make the correlation from their actions and policies
and the drop in ridership. This includes employee conduct. Just a former new flyer transit operator
from Virginia with 3 years of observation now on RTD and well, I still wait for the ability to applaud
RTD for doing something correct, observations and easily heard comments from riders show that
Denver will not have reliable public transportation anytime this decade at the current pace and with
the leadership in place. Union Station (train areas) also appalling. The urine rich aroma of public
transportation in Paris, is still far cleaner than the RTD and it’s well known those aren’t water puddles.
RTD is the problem, public transport is meant to be a solution, perhaps new leadership with European
and or real world experience is necessary. With road rage accidents on the rise, this is the time to
shine for public transport, not continue to circle the drain down the toilet. Hopefully RTD can make
positive changes, in less than 10+ years, my optimism remains low.
Please continue the EcoPass program. It has pushed me to use RTD more consistently and to get more
cars off the road. It is a great program for companies/organizations that buy into it. I am a BVSD
employee and get the EcoPass through BVSD. I love it and wish it was also available for my family. The
new fare structures look reasonable (especially the free youth option), but the EcoPass needs to
continue as well. Thank you.

I live within a very short walk to 10th & Osage and work a very short walk from Orchard. I chose this
job and house due to proximity to RTD. I never take it though as I feel uneasy at the 10th & Osage
station with all the vagrants hanging by the grassy slope. And the zone fare is just too expensive to
justify. Yes we can afford it, but there comes a point where it just doesn't make sense. There should
be a charge, just not so cost prohibitive for those who do not get subsidized. But enough of a cost to
keep the vagrants from taking up all the space. Also need to step up security. Drugs are out of hand.
Another huge disappointment is the RTD after a Fiddlers Green event. We gave up on that year's ago.
Always worried that we wouldn't fit on the one last train that runs when the show lets out. And way
too long of a wait time to catch that last train. They should be a few trains ready to go when big
events let out. I hope you can get us back as customers, we've been so disappointed by the whole
system...
Kids zero fair would allow more to ride it. I can’t afford it with the kids and myself
Love the new structure! Feels much simpler for first time or out-of-town users.
Simplify the tickets by allowing/limiting rides by time-of-use, not Regions crossed. Riders taking the D
train from Littleton-Mineral have a total of ONE stop that's in their "Local" region. Riders taking the W
train, from JeffCo Govt's Cntr-Golden have ZERO stops in their "Local region. Riders taking the E and
R trains, from RidgeGate Pkwy, in contrast, have NUMEROUS stops, before hitting a new region. This
makes no sense and financially burdens/punishes riders, based on where they live.
Fare should be free and frequent. RTD is a PUBLIC SERVICE that should be fully funded through taxes
and grants. I moved into a house because of its proximity to the light rail six years ago and took the
light rail downtown. Then the (already more expensive than driving) price went up, then trek of the
three stops I used got cut and frequency decreased, then the price went up again, then violent
policing increased (of POC and of queer people like myself), then the frequency decreased again, and
now I drive downtown every day, sometimes multiple times a day, because I can’t afford to burn time
or money trying and won’t risk state sponsored harassment to support a public services that has done
everything it can to convince the public not to use it. I’m hoping the Lynx BRT will help with reliability
but if it costs $6-$19 (not sure which fare level it will be for that distance) for me to take it to my
favorite brewery in Aurora, I’ll just keep taking a car.
In the last years Arapahoe Ridge HS have been supporting our student with RTD bus passes in order
for our students to come to school and to go to work. RTD can support our students and facilitate
them with their most important need which happens to be transportation. Lack of transportation is
the biggest reason for missing attendance, by helping the students with RTD tickets, we can reduce
this problem by 90%. Most of our students come from families that are going through financial
hardship that cannot afford transportation. By helping them with this, they can now go to school and
start their path to success.
My school has been working under a grant for the past two years to provide bussing for students to
attend ARHS. We also offer credit to students for working in the community. What we have found is
that students do not have transportation to and from work. FREE to STUDENTS is an excellent way to
support the working class of Boulder. 70% of my school is free and reduced lunch. The families
support education but don't have the means to get their students to school. This proposal would be a
DREAM COME TRUE for families of poverty in Boulder County.
After reviewing the recommended fare structure, I am in favor. As an infrequent rider, I was
frequently confused as to which fare I needed to purchase. Combining local and regional makes
sense. I appreciate the lower fee structure. Price to ride was not an issue for me; however, I'm sure
that will be welcome by transit reliant/financially burdened customers. I'm wondering how this will
be subsidized.

1) I really want to ride and support public transportation but the price and time to drive is still much
better. The price is going to have to lower much more than 25 cents to get my family on public more
often. 2) Would it be possible to up the amount of hour for a pass from 3 to 4? That would also get
me on public more often and make it possible to use just one ticket to go to an event for example.
3) Or how about a bigger discount than 10% for 10 pack tickets? 4) I have a gap year program with
numerous young people that use RTD. They all usually take the same bus but they all can't ride their
bikes b/c only two bikes fit on the rack and can't be brought on bus. This really limits us!
We deem that this initiative would be undoubtedly equitable for students in our district, specifically
those undergoing housing challenges, who are qualified to receive McKinney Vento Services. This
school year we've had our highest number ever of unhoused families at BVSD.

I’m particularly happy that RTD is simplifying the structure and creating significant cost savings for the
most frequent users of the system through the changes to the monthly pass. I believe the lower

for the monthly passes. I urge you to adopt these changes, implement them as soon as possible, and

Free fares for those under 19 is a great step toward improving attendance for public school students.
Transportation cost should not be a barrier for accessing a free, appropriate, public education.
I live on a light rail stop and never use it because it is too expensive. I used it once this year and the
train I planned to take home was cancelled, so I had to call a ride share car. I also used to work near
another lightrail stop on the other end of the city three days a week. It still was too expensive and
didn't make sense to use. The stop I live on is also in a different zone and so, last I checked, it is more
expensive to use the one here than to drive a short distance to another one that is just as far south. I
use it less than once a year.
I love that 19 and younger are free. I think the fare structure should be $3, $6, and $90.
Way to go RTD on the proposal to make fares reasonably priced for all, create a program for all youth
under 19 to hop on transit, and making the LIVE monthly program more affordable and less
cumbersome. As a city planner and lover/supporter of transit, my main question is how RTD will
sustain funding for the fare cost reductions...with the assumption that more people will ride?
This is an excellent idea to create a more accessible, inclusive public transit system in Denver,
specifically for those who require it for daily commuting. Personally, this would encourage me to use
it more and also make it more feasible to get to the airport.
I agree with the proposed changes. This would simplify my life and make the community more
accessible to all parties.
I was very happy to see RTD proposing a reduction in fare prices. When I moved to the metro area, I
was eager to make more use of public transit for convenience, savings, and the environment. But I
was shocked to see the high prices of both rail *and* bus services. How is RTD meant to encourage
public transit use and the reduction of smog and congestion when it is *cheaper* to drive, even with
the summer’s high gas prices? My 20 mile round-trip commute costs around $3-3.50 in gas; even with
the added cost of insurance and car maintenance, it seems to barely match the $6 round-trip bus
fare, which is significantly less convenient. I have lived in metro areas where bus transit is significantly
cheaper than RTD or even free. I am glad for RTD’s lower fares, and hope they will be further lowered.
I also would like to see greater transparency in why the fares are so high compared to other metro
areas—or if in fact this is not the case.

I'm so glad to hear that the access for Youth will improve. Too many times growing up in Houston I
was unable to participate in educational, volunteer or work opportunities. Our youth, especially our
economically disadvantaged youth, deserve access and I'm so proud to live in a state, and city that
cares.
$3.00 is expensive compared to other cities across the US. I suggest if we keep the $3.00, make that a
full day pass so riders can complete a number of errands rather than just have the 3 hour window.
I support new reduced rates (which are still higher than pre-COVID fares). Transit in the metro area is
expensive.
I agree to lower the RTD fare for all people in this community.
Look forward to lower fares
Make fares cheaper and more affordable for all! And a place to call security or cops from unruly
people in the bus
RTD should be free. The current price is ridiculous and unfair for the people that rely on it for daily
transportation. The city should spend less resources for car infrastructure and put more into public
transportation and infrastructure.
I really like the proposed changes! I especially like the Zero Fare for Youth program and the lower
monthly pass cost.
I am very pleased with RTD's new fare structure, especially the lower fares for monthly passes,
simplified discount categories, and free fares for younger people. I would like to see RTD work
actively to secure funds from the state.
I appreciate the simplified fare structure and lower fares. Nice job! I hope your efforts will get a few
more people out of their cars.
$1.00 should be the fare for all rides.
I think the Airport fee should be lower so that a family can take the train for cheaper than paying to
park at the airport.
I fully support the new changes in recommended fare structure and how it would greatly benefit
lower income, disabled, marginalized, and unhoused populations that lack access to transportation.
This would particularly allow the people we serve in our organization easier access to resources such
as appointments, food banks, work, etc. that are so crucial to supporting them in the community.
Most times I ride the AB bus to and from DIA there are no enough seats for all the passengers. People
stand for 40 minutes while on a bus going over 60 mph on a highway. This is so unsafe. Why does rtd
not run enough busses on this route? Why are you endangering your riders because you don’t want
to add busses?

I like the new fare structure. Lower prices should help get more riders, and it is definitely a good idea
to lower the cost of the monthly pass.
I'm thrilled to see the $88 monthly pass fee for the Regional routes and the streamlining of the pricing
structure. I ride RTD frequently and even I'm confused about how the current fare structure works. I
never know when I get on the buses headed out of Denver if I'm going to be paying $3 or $5.25.
Since "troublemakers" and the homeless are now allowed to ride free (drivers tell me they're not
supposed to confront anyone or refuse them a seat), upstanding citizens should have the fare waived
as well.
The one thing I see missing is an annual fare . Businesses can pay as little as $350/yr for a commuter
pass, but individuals it’s closer to $3k. It will be better if you buy 12 monthly passes at $88/mo, but
what about just having an annual pass with a discount? It would save in monthly administrative costs
and benefit riders whose companies don’t purchase passes.
Free fare. You have tried everything else and it doesn't work Take a look at Luxembourg with their

moving the 3-hour fare to $2 and if not, encourage you to do so. It’s an exact change and could drive
ridership up. The lower the barrier to riding for cash customers, the better. Having 10 people paying
$2.75, is one thing. Getting 30-35 at $2.00 would be a major win money-wise. Busses are running
regardless, why not make sure they’re always more than half full? Not to mention, the lack of giving
change, really means the fare is $3 for cash customers. I urge you to adopt these changes,
implement them as soon as possible, and keep pushing for state funding to further improve the fare

Greetings RTD Team ~ I’m writing to share my comments about the proposed changes to the RTD
fare and pass structure. I’m VERY grateful RTD is simplifying the structure and reducing the cost for all
riders (especially those that depend on RTD as their primary form of transportation). I really like
seeing the free fares for youth pilot program, and consolidation of the discount programs into one.
I would; however, love to see the 3-hour passes be $2 even (instead of $2.75). I have taken numerous
transit/bus routes where the fee was only $2. This makes everything easier, smoother, and less
stressful - on drivers, on riders, on those who one any number of edges financially - running late - in
challenging weather. I am grateful for the work around providing grants/discounts for community
serving organizations. I would recommend that this is as easy as possible for said
organizations/leaders. I would also recommend that there are perks/incentives for these leaders to
educate, connect, and promote transit ridership. In addition to making permanent free fares for
youth, I would love to see more advocacy from RTD - publicly and politically - around safe and
accessible ACCESS to bus stops/stations. I would also love to see creative fundraising
schemes/programs to invite community to help privately fund (or partially/privately fund) bus stop
shelters - with local artists, ADA codes, and support from RTD and city/county agencies. These
changes would make our transit system truly accessible and affordable. As a full-time pedestrian
and transit user, we need our system to radically CENTER access/dignity for those who depend on
these systems the most, programs/organizing around climate action responsibility and transit, and
community partners/agencies who can help expand funding, increase ridership, and shift
harmful/false stigmas around transit. In gratitude, Jonathon

Lowering the fares will be SUPER helpful in convincing (new) folks to take public transit, as well as
helping those who already struggle to afford it. I don't have a car and have relied on RTD since I
moved to Denver in 2018, and I am thrilled to see these changes and updates. I am a graduate
student at the University of Denver, and I love the student pass I receive through DU's bulk policy with
RTD. As an aside, the #1 change that would improve the overall quality of taking RTD is *frequency*
of buses. I know this is dependent on employing more drivers, but it would DRASTICALLY improve the
ease of taking transit. Thank you!
I make decent money and recently purchased a condo in Denver. I'm doing okay. Public transit here
isn't affordable. For a family of 4 to go to the airport and back is $80. I can park and drive and feel
very safe for LESS! The bus to Boulder, more expensive than driving unless you are a student. You
need to general middle class to use the transit to subsidize all the other people using it but it's not a
deal. It sometime MORE than driving. There is NO motivator to use the public transit besides
traveling to the airport solo. I don't use it any other time because it is not affordable. If it was $3 per
person I would exclusively use it to go to and from the airport. A dollar saved is a dollar made. I'm
over paying a lot for a poor service. Make it a fair affordable price and we will come use it all the time.
Until then, I'll be driving and parking.
We work with arts workers all over the metro area who use buses and light rail as well as those who
wish they could use it but currently can’t. Schedules don’t go as late as they could, service is
unreliable and currently unsafe on multiple routes, and prices, especially to the airport, have been
cost prohibitive given the available routes and timed schedules. A more integrated system that
benefits performing arts workers that work long hours in the night and in multiple areas is paramount
for this group to be regular RTD riders.
we should make all fares minimal to encourage the public to use ALL available forms of public transit.
The only way to get cars off the roads - and provide transportation alternatives is to have a lot of
frequent options. This means smaller vehicles (i.e. 15 passenger vans) and more frequent stops
throughout towns and cities. Large Empty Buses are a waste of taxpayer resources. Side Note when is the commuter rail coming to Boulder? We have waited a decade with no progress. Time for
Eminent Domain - or a major investment - or return our money!
Make sure to have markedly lower fares for low income/elderly/disabled, thank you!
I think the fare structure should be changed. It is almost as expensive as owning a car for the current
daily rider.
I think this is an excellent idea that will get more people to use the bus and increase revenue through
volume.
Public transit should be viewed as part of infrastructure like roads and city parks and should be
heavily subsidized for everyone. Rich people will still drive their Mercedes to work, don’t worry. You
want people to use it and not have to keep expanding highways - then stop spending money on
highways and put it into public transit subsidies. Look at countries where it’s done successfully. Asking
people to show they are poor enough to get a discount and to track all that will require so much work
that it won’t be worth it. Stop trying to make it fair, make it WORK. Make people love it and depend
on it - and then people will be willing to pay more for the convenience.
Follow CTA -Chicago Transit Authority’s pricing model!
I think the fare needs to be cheaper than it is to park downtown. We almost rode today but it would
have cost my husband and me $6 each, totaling $12. On SpotHero, I found parking for $10. We chose
to drive instead since it was cheaper. Also, some of the RTD light rail lots require you to pay to park.
All parking should be free since we’re paying to use the light rail. In sum, it’s often cheaper for the 2
of us to park downtown than it is to use public transportation.

I ride the bus in Seattle as a senior citizen. The reduced fare is $1 each trip including the express bus
to the airport. If you really want ridership among the elderly, the fee of $1 should be effect for us. In
addition, the flex rides should be available late nights and on the weekends as well. It is too
expensive for UBR from the airport. Also, I ride the AT bus to Arapahoe. When my flight is later than
11:17 PM, the bus does not go to Arapahoe station. It is a 5 mile walk, so I sleep at the airport until
the 6:17AM bus. Thanks this forum to discuss fare and improvements.
As a student, this would be super helpful to me and other students who struggle with other
transportation!
Current Price too high. Proposed one looks great Dirty seats. Please replace
This fare structure is such a huge step in the right direction. Much simpler, and more in line with the
cost of transit in other comparable cities. (Public transit should be free, though). I’m hoping there’s a
way to do some kind of pay as you go for a monthly pass, so riders who don’t have the $ upfront for a
pass don’t end up paying more than those of us with more liquidity.
Love it!!!! Finally, it will cost me less to ride the train from Broadway to Lone Tree than to drive to
work!!!! Thank you!!!!! I love the light rail. And the airport fare is still reasonable. Also given the
dangers with speed and what happened on the golden line, I recommend using cameras and speed
monitors so engineers will be watched and not be permitted to travel at excessive speeds. The cost
of Monitoring public safety on transit, a basic obligation of RTD, will more than cover the expense the
city will incur as a result of the recent unfortunate accident, increase public trust, protect riders, and
increase ridership.
I live in North Denver and go to the Tech Center. Here are reasons why I don't: 1) Union Station is full
of bums! Why on earth would I want to pass thru? 2) The light rail is SLOW. I can get by car just as
fast even in heavy rush hour traffic. 3) The fare isn't worth it if I had to do this weekly. You're asking
me to pay $200 a month when it costs the same in gas for a compact car? 4) Very few creature
comforts, food/drink services along line. I would love to use mass transit, but it makes no economic
sense, hard to use and feels unsafe.
free fare for people 19 and under
Make all public transportation free.
I think It would benefit the public, and it would be awesome for the environment
Absolutely love the lower fare idea! RTD is solid for what it does and staff are always friendly!
Make public transit free for all.
I pay 200 a month for transportation to and from work and it gets expensive in the months I don't use
it to it's full capacity
One of the reasons I don't often use the light rail when I can is because of the outrageous prices. It's
handy to jump on a train to Park Meadows but cheaper to drive when traveling with a family of 4. It's
well over $30 bucks round trip for all of us. It is senseless to have such high fairs per person- it's a
deterrent to riding RTD. If your goal is to make money it shouldn't be off the limited people who will
ride. Lower the prices to affordable prices, that makes it cheaper than driving a car, and more people
will take advantage of it, hence RTD will bring in more money. The light rail to the airport is ridiculous.
We want to take it but for a family of 4 it is $80 round trip. No we'll just get a ride to and from. Also
get some security on each lightrail/ bus. They're are people who harass and bully others on the bus.
It isn't safe.
I realize you are in a "catch 22", but you have increased fares and decreased service. If you had
service that ran more often I would be more inclined to take the bus. The senior discount is good for
me, as I am a senior. Riding light rail is confusing because of the fair scale for longer trips, because I
am not sure what zone I'm in when I get on or off.
Please lower the cost!

Totally agree with Free Youth fares!
I'm very onboard with these changes, but would like to see further reduction in the regular fare as
well. RTD is one of the most expensive transit in the country, and it affects ridership. For example, we
went to a Rockies game with family and friends the other day, and we would have loved to take the
bus. But it was the same price for four adults to drive and park downtown as it would have been for
us to take the bus. That seems backwards.
Please make the A Line route to the airport either free or significantly more affordable. Incent people
to use it rather than it being an easier/cheaper option to drive and park at one of the outer lots or
take a taxi or rideshare. It's $40 for two people to take a round trip A Line ride to the airport, that's
likely why it's underutilized.
The most important thing for the success of the system is high numbers of riders which can only be
achieved through frequent service along routes connecting areas of interest. Please do not reduce
fees too much or move to a free fare model which would undermine the ability of the system to
operate with enough service to make it a viable alternative to driving.
I visited Seattle and their senior fare for either light rail or bus is $1, period, no matter how long your
trip.
Public transit should be free.
I agree with under 19 ride free. Provide the next generation with a love for mass/community transit.
I agree with expanding employer sponsored passes. This is the best way to do ridership outreach for
commuters. Give a tax inventive for the businesses. Time based passes were a welcome change.
Enable NFC pass scanning for phones. Create a family pass for getting to the airport. Simple flat rate
for groups traveling to/from the airport. It has to be less expensive than driving plus the cheapest
parking option at the airport.
I am writing to express my support for the proposed fare structure as recommended by the RTD Fare
Study. The new fare structure is much simpler to understand for riders and will offer some incredibly
good value journeys on RTD such as Denver to Boulder. In addition, the proposed $88 monthly fare
cap / pass will offer anybody who uses RTD multiple times a week a great deal, including those who
work at Denver Airport. I am also in support of raising the LiVE discount to 50% and providing steeply
discounted monthly fare caps / passes and airport fares for low income riders, seniors, Medicare
recipients and riders with disabilities. Lastly, I support the trial of free youth fares, which will be a
huge benefit to the districts’ high school students.
It would be good to explain more how this fare structure would work for families. I initially was
thinking it would cost $50 to bring a family of 5 to the airport on the A line which isn't competitive
with driving or Lyft/Uber. However, after spending some time reading the policies and programs
section it sounds like children under 5 ride free and other ages receive a substantial discount. This
was news to me. Advertising these price reductions for children would be good as my family and
other families I've talked with in the metro area weren't aware of them and thus didn't consider RTD
as a serious option for getting around. Overall, I think the fare structure is a huge improvement
over the previous one. It greatly simplifies fare calculus and bringing the monthly pass under $100
while including the airport is quite attractive.
I would like the bus fare to be free for all people under 19 because it would help me get to and from
school without worrying if I need money for the bus.
Something that I've never heard discussed is incentivizing loyal RTD customers. Reward those who
take RTD regularly, offer promotional pricing for NEW customers that sign up, give free passes for
out-of-town family & guests. The goal is to get people out of their cars and lowering the cost of a ride
by a quarter doesn't do that. Allow people to earn points to get a free monthly pass. Those savings
could mean a lot to people.

What is the specific pricing structure for EcoPasses and neighborhood EcoPasses? I can’t find the
actual pricing on the fare equity study website.
Make fares free for youths
Having free bus passes monthly for students in Denver public schools as well as for Auraria campus
students would be extremely beneficial and help make transportation as well as education more
equitable.
I'm very much in favor of free fares for people 19 and under. I work at North High School and Skinner
Middle School Especially at North, MANY of our students ride the bus to school each day. We offer
discounted bus passes, but free rides would make a huge difference to our students. I also think that
knowing the bus is always free would encourage young people to use RTD much more often.
Greetings: As a representative of the largest advocacy organization of the blind in Colorado, I want
to say at the outset that the manner in which the recommended fare structure is being presented is
incredibly difficult to read because of the numerous links that a person must activate in order to glean
any useful information. We understand the recommendation would eliminate regional fares over-all,
both for full-fare and discount-fare customers. But saying that fares would be reduced by a certain
amount without indicating the final fare under the new structure makes it harder for the reader to
understand what is happening. Why not just say (for example) that for full-fare customers, the regular
fare would be reduced from $3 to $2.75 and that for discount customers, . the fare would be reduced
from $1.50 to $1.35. If, in fact, you have a single page which lays all of this out, I would be happy to
receive a file which we could share with our blind members, friends, and colleagues. Cordially,
Curtis Chong National Federation of the Blind of Colorado
As a middle school social worker in DPS, I am writing in STRONG support of the Youth fare proposal
for free transit pass for all youth 19 and under. Our high school students have historically been able
to access free bus passes in order to utilize RTD for transport to and from school and activities. We
have many middle school students, especially those with truancy issues, who's parents have
unreliable or no formal transporation of their own who are missing out on their education due to
accessibility due to lack of transportation and/or hardship financial impact on family even with
reduced youth fare. Having this RTD pass available to middle schoolers will provide the benefit of
allowing students to have agency in getting themselves to school without relying on an adult and to
gain skills in RTD ridership for their use in the future as a Denver resident. Please approve this option
as a means to increase equity for all students to be able to get themselves to and from school and
their outside activities that builds protective factors for youth.
I like the new proposed plan and would ride far more often with that fare structure for a monthly
pass.
I support the reduced fare proposal. I pay the monthly full fare every month as I commute from
Westminster to Downtown using the FF1 bus and the proposed reduced fares would have a huge
positive impact on my family’s budget.
I’m very excited for this updated fare structure. For me personally, it never made sense financially to
take public transit to my destinations due to the high cost. Now with these reductions, it’s going to
take me out of my car more often then not in the future. I do have a concern on the standard 3-hour
and daily rates. Because they are not even dollars, I do think it’ll make things difficult to those who
must pay with cash and if drivers don’t carry change, it’ll mean they are spending more to ride. I hope
you can find a reasonable solution to this, either by reducing the price or including some kind of
transit ticket where you can load cash into.
Ok
Due to the fact that Denver Public Schools does not provide school bus transportation for students, it
is critical that the Zero Fare for students under the age of 19. Please also consider route changes to
transport students to school efficiently.

I work at the hospital and my husband at the airport... I think hospital employees and airport
employees should get some type of discount on monthly passes.
STOP shifting the burden of payment to others. To be equitable, everyone (regardless of color, creed,
etc.) should pay the same amount. RTD cannot afford to lower rates, especially when they need to
ENFORCE policy by stopping the non-paying riders. More-&-more I don't feel safe on RTD, and that
will cause more of us to STOP riding. Reduced fares, "equity" programs, and lack of enforcement in
trains will continue to make RTD go down-hill and lose customers.
Are you, or can you, bring back discounted coupon booklets?! I see a problem with feeding in three
dollar bills and expecting to get back 30 cents in change. And the ticket kiosks where I ride from
(Southmoor) has had one out-of-service since before Covid. I would much rather buy a ticket booklet
and not have to deal with either the kiosk or with change.
I’m writing to share my excitement and concerns about the proposed changes to the RTD fare and
pass structure. I’m happy RTD is simplifying the structure and reducing the cost for all riders but
especially frequent riders through the monthly pass. I’m also excited to see the free fares for youth

barriers to true accessibility and affordability. The 3-hour passes, by requiring exact change, will mean
many folks who pay with cash on the bus will end up paying more. Additionally, I’d like RTD to remove
some of the requirements to qualify for discounted passes that prevent access for folks who need
transit accessibility the most. I’d also like RTD to prioritize ﬁnding funding for a permanent free fares
for youth program. These changes would make our transit system truly accessible and affordable. I
know these require increased funding, and I urge RTD to pursue partnerships with the state for these
changes.
Fares should be less if I only need 1 ride down the road I spend $6 a day for 1 bus 2 ways
I am delighted that you are lowering fares. This is such a positive step to increase ridership. I admit I
was not well-versed in the equity issues involved, but am happy that this is being
addressed/publicized as well.
I support removing the regional fare and making the monthly pass much cheaper! Great work on this!
The airport fare is very expensive. $10+ per ticket is excessive. Especially, if you are only 2 stops
away from the airport. The airport train cost should be based on where you are going verse a flat
rate...like the other lines. Also, the bus from Union Station to Boulder is amazing. Could there be a
future train instead of the bus?
The buses need to be more clean there are some that are dirty
I think that the new lower fare for everyone and the one price local/regional are going to boost usage.
The zero fare for under 19 is going to bring rtd so much more business year round. This'll help create
jobs and make less emissions/smaller carbon footprint and working towards climate justice. I also like
the increased discount for LiVE Income-Based Fare Discount participants.
They should give more discount on the 1 month ticket a lot of people can’t afford to pay so much
money at once

I hope the lower pass program minimums encourages my employer to participate. The cost of
commuting as we return to the office, particularly parking, feels so high. I would love a free transit
benefit. It would give me a reason to opt for the train.
Have you permanently closed the Downtown Boulder bus station? I live a block away and I've seen no
interior changes in the last 3 months? Please announce and publicize your plans for the bus station!
I am a social worker with Denver Public Schools and I am a huge proponent of the Zero Fare for Youth
Pilot. Anything we can do to reduce barriers for youth to attending school is so vital. I wonder if this
pilot can be tied to existing programs/structures such as the MyDenver Card or school ID cards. Thank
you for work on this and your efforts to engage the community.
So thankful that kids under 19 will be able to get the bus for free. I can see what a hardship even the
reduced fare/monthly pass has on my teen’s friends. Thank you for piloting this.
Age discrimination. That is a point that I would like to see considered. You plan to give one age group
free travel, and still expect everyone else to pay. So, for example, you have two friends board. One is
19, the other is 20. One of them has to pay and but the other gets to ride free. It makes no sense.
How hard is it to expect a youth to pay $0.90 or $1.80. If free for one, than it has to be free for all. A
good segway to the next point: Why have any fares at all if you do not plan to ever enforce it? It is
warning, after warning, after warning. But no actual consequences. "Educate and accommodate"
that's all I ever hear. How many times should someone be "educated" before there is any
ENFORCEMENT? There are laws for a reason. Use those laws to enforce fares. Or simply stop all fares
and go to a FULLY FREE system. It is not practical to have it both ways. It is not fair to not make
everyone or no one pay fares. It is not fair to single out one age group to be free and then expect
others to pay. It is not fair to expect people to pay, but yet not consequence those that do not pay.
Just get it over with and go to a fully free ride system. And then beef up police presence on the buses
and trains because free will attract crime, homeless camping, drug use, etc. The system still has not
recovered from 'free for covid' issues that continue to plague the transit system.
I used to love taking RTD before the pandemic. I am very leary of going back due to the increase in
crime. I hope this will be addressed.
The new fare structure is great and will help the region reach its equity, climate, and safety goals. Can
you provide more transparency online about how this will impact RTD's overall budget? My only
concern is that the loss in revenue will lead to additional service cuts, when what we need most right
now is more frequent service and extended service hours. Thank you.

The current price structure that RTD is using, penalizes individuals that are considering using public
transport. A couple looking to go downtown will spend upwards of 20$ on just transit with RTD. This
does not encourage public transit use.
Please, please deal with various riders who feel entitled to smoke or vape on the train or bus. It is
unfair to the non-smoking riders to observe the security guards also covertly vape on the train
platforms, and then they expect us to obey the rules they supposedly have the power to enforce. It
can be harmful when I need to step away from the smokers who need to puff up in billows of germy
smoke just before boarding.
I like and appreciate the lower pricing that is proposed for RTD Service. The price has been going up
and the quality has been going down of RTD Services: timeliness, cleanliness, safety, reliability etc.
Also, it didn’t make sense that it cost the same amount to go to Boulder as it does to go to the airport
from Denver. The price of $10.50 round trip for a trip that is more than 3 hours was not the most
logical, especially since 1 hour of that time is spent on the bus so the transfer would only be good for
2 hours. Also, I haven’t liked the zoning since I started using RTD over 10 years ago. It is difficult for
new riders to understand and makes traveling within the Boulder/Denver/Aurora metro area more
expensive and deters people from going outside of their zone.
The new fare structure makes the monthly fare something I would actually purchase. As a 4-5 day a
week user, the current local monthly fare doesn’t make any sense for me to use because if I go on a
trip, work from home an extra day, or need to drive to work for whatever reason, I end up spending
more than I would on local fare 10-packs. At an $88 flat rate for full use of the system, I’d buy that
every month. It also incentivizes me as a regular rider to take the train to the airport. As someone
who does not necessarily live close to the A-line, the cost of taking the A line+a cab to the station vs
driving to the airport is a wash. The next thing I hope to see is increased frequency of A line trains
and have increased frequency later into the night (or atleast on busy nights like sundays). As it
stands, transferring from light rail to the A-line adds 15 minutes to the already long trip to the airport
I think the change in the fare prices is a really good idea especially for those of us who use the bus on
a regular basis. The only thing that would be amazing is if Live offered a monthly pass. I think giving
youth a free monthly pass is a fabulous idea.
They should not let anyone come in the bus like homeless
RTD buses and light rail are already free for anyone who chooses not to pay.
They should lower the mond pass it it to much money to pay at once
They should lower the month pass so many people cant aford to buy The pass because it is to much
money
They should lower the price and have equil prices for al type of trasportacion
All older people should not have to pay to ride a bus
I take the A line daily to the airport for work and I think the monthly fare of $88.00 will help al lot of
us passengers especially people who need to take public transit to get to work daily.
For taking time to read the police’s and putting them in place
I think the new fare will benefit everyone across the community. I fully rely on RTD and I've been
utilizing RTD for 38 years since I was 15. I don't know how the discount programs work though so it
would be hard for me to help others apply in my community.
Move the airport fare to $11.50 but create a Colorado residents discount that lowers the fare to $5.00
for residents by entering their zip code and their drivers license/state ID number at the time of
purchase. The rider could make this part of their RTD app profile so that they don’t need to reenter it
over and over again. This system would have tourists subsidize the system while avoiding excessive
fares for residents who need to ride more frequently.

I hope the fares can be reduced or removed entirely for the people of Colorado. Having better access
and more realiable public transportation will benefit everyone in the long run.
I fully support the new fare structure. This is very similar to the fare structure that was in place when I
was living in Chicago. It made the system easy to understand and easy to navigate and was a big
reason why I felt happy relying on public transport throughout the entire time I lived in that city.
Upon moving to Denver, I thought the RTD fair structure was confusing and priced too high for what
the system offered. At the time I worked at the airport and ultimately I had to resort to driving,
because it made more economical sense.
This is a step in the right direction for the RTD and access to regional transit will benefit from this. I
personally do not currently use this service because of the cost, I commute to Boulder and the price
for bus fare is about the same as driving without the convenience. If this new structure is
implemented, there is more of a benefit to me personally in using public transit (along with less
impact on the environment, traffic, etc.). I imagine I'm not alone in my reasoning and that ridership
will increase, justifying more investment in the system from the state. This is a good thing for
everyone!
Until you make good on the NW Rail, I consider you as nothing more than a group of thieves.
I think it's a good idea to have both the local and regional fares combined into one price. It's time
consuming having to check the schedules just to see which buses are local and regional. I remember
sometime last year, I emailed a RTD representative about what pass I have to buy to get to work. I
was told local, but it turns out that I needed the regional pass. The two different prices for local and
regional is so confusing that even customer service cannot figure it out. Please combine it into one
price.
Cut the cost of fares and you will see more people use the trains. = more $
Please pass this and the current structure is confusing and pricey for those of that don't drive
I applaud RTD for the changes in fare collection. The new fare structure will make transit easier to
use and more accessible to folks on limited income. The new monthly pass program will likely
increase ridership. But RTD needs to do even more to increase ridership. Raising funds from the
state to improve service by increasing frequency and reliability along major transit routes would
probably increase ridership even more.
I’m writing to share my excitement and questions about the proposed changes to the RTD fare and

I'd love to see increased frequency, more consolidated lines focused on Denver and less on the

without having to rely on cars. I urge you to adopt these fare changes, implement them as soon as
possible, and keep pushing for state funding to further improve the fare and pass structure toward

Airport employees currently are nearly punished for commuting on the RTD with the monthly pass
being $200 (no benefit for a regular commute of less than 20 days/month). If you bring this down,
you’ll be bringing more employees to the airport and therefore more sustainable growth for Denver!
love the changes in general. it's easier and cheaper. however, the airport is still too expensive. I think
it's ok to charge a premium for the airport but only if the service is top notch. to qualify for such a
premium, I think frequency would have to increase as well as reliability. I don't think the current
service qualifies for $10
I would like to express my support for the proposed fare structure recommended by the Fare Study.
The new fare structure is much simpler to understand for riders (I moved here last year and it took
some time to understand it). I believe the proposed $88 monthly pass will offer anybody who uses
RTD multiple times a week a great deal, including those who work at Denver Airport. I am also in
support of raising the LiVE discount to 50% and providing steeply discounted monthly fare caps /
passes and airport fares for low income riders, seniors, Medicare recipients and riders with
disabilities. Lastly, I support the trial of free youth fares, which will be a huge benefit to the districts’
high school students and will instill the transit goals our nation wants in our young folks.
Hi, just wanted to say that I'm a fan of the reduced monthly fare. I've previously considered getting a
monthly pass because it would encourage me to take the train more. The previous monthly price
simply did not make sense unless I was commuting daily. The more people that have a monthly pass
the better, it's much easier to decide to ride transit if it's already paid for
This policy does sound more equitable.
I support the proposed fare structure as recommended by the RTD Fare Study. The new fare
structure is much simpler to understand and is more equitable for people who rely on transit for
many trips a month. The lower fares and simplified pricing structure may increase ridership while
being cost-effective for frequent riders. I am also in support of raising the LiVE discount to 50% and
providing steeply discounted monthly fare caps/passes and airport fares for low-income riders,
seniors, Medicare recipients, and riders with disabilities. Lastly, I support the trial of free youth fares.
Hello, thank you for reducing the airport fare and suggesting the Zero Fare For Youth pilot. I think this
is huge because the current pricing is still an unattractive option for many families. Take for example a
family of 2 adults and 2 children taking a 5 day trip. The round trip A-line cost is $80 and parking at
the airport will be approximately $86 (in the Economy lot which is a 5 minute walk). With the Zero
Fare For Youth program, that same A-line roundtrip comes down to $40, a much more attractive
option!
As a refugee resettlement caseworker, I support the simpler fare structure of local/airport instead of
local/regional/airport. The lower cost of a monthly pass is also a great idea. We support our new
refugee and immigrant neighbors with bus passes as they search for and begin employment in metro
Denver. We often purchase passes or ticket books in bulk so I highly support the recommendation
"to support nonprofits, employers and social service organizations through bulk purchase discounts,
Pass program expansions and a transit assistance grant program." Our nonprofit's budgets are very
tight and any way to help our newcomers make it around the city safely are welcome. We are in high
need of volunteers & workers who could provide transit training to our newcomers, so a grant
program to help pay for that would be something we could apply for. Thank you.
Thank you for proposing more affordable fares!!
I support efforts to reduce fares to make transit access more equitable and increase ridership.
I've been away for the last two years but I miss riding the trains. I'd like to think with the new fare
structures and an e-bike, people would give up driving as much do the monthly pass. April 2019 - Oct
2019 was a great period in my life when I took my e-bike on the G and A line getting off at Central
Park and riding the rest. My emotional state was so much better when I rode.

I am very supportive of the proposed fare structure as recommended by the RTD Fare Study. The new

particularly for families traveling with children. In addition, the proposed $88 monthly fare cap / pass

I am writing to express my support for the proposed fare structure as recommended by the RTD Fare
Study. The new fare structure is much simpler to understand for riders and will offer some incredibly
good value journeys on RTD such as Denver to Boulder. In addition, the proposed $88 monthly fare

I am absolutely thrilled to see this simplified fare structure. One of the biggest mental barriers when
taking light rail especially is trying to figure out local vs regional zones, especially when the difference
between them wasn't always clear. Every simplification of the fare structure makes it easier and
easier to get where I'm going without having to do mental gymnastics trying to figure out which ticket
is needed, and therefore makes it easier to just ride and get where I'm going. I'm glad to see RTD
moving further in this direction. I am most excited about the single price monthly pass. Due to the
zone issues and the high cost of the current fare structure, a monthly pass has not been feasable for
me or most people I know. Reducing the cost and providing a single pass for all areas makes it much
more likely that I'll maintain a monthly pass out of convenience if nothing else.
I’m writing to share both my excitement about the proposed changes to RTD fares, as well as some
recommendations for how to continue to make RTD more accessible and equitable. First and
foremost, it's an incredible boon to riders to simplify the fare system. Thank you for doing that! Just
as exciting are the free fares for youth pilot program and consolidation of the discount programs into
one. I am concerned, though, about how the 3-hour passes will end up costing certain folks who
pay in cash to pay more, because RTD doesn't issue change. I’d like to advocate for requirements to
be relaxed so that more individuals could qualify for discounted passes. Last, I want RTD to prioritize
finding funding for a permanent free fares for youth program. Obviously, these aren't changes that
could be made without additional funding. Could RTD pursue partnerships with the state to make
these changes happen?
Price is ridiculously high and not cost effective! Especially when it’s not reliable.
When I first moved to Denver, I honestly avoided RTD because I didn’t understand the system,
specifically “local vs. regional” destinations. I had lived in DC and London and traveled in New York
and Boston on the public transportation, but those systems seemed much more intuitive to me. The
first time I used RTD was to take the A line to the Airport because I knew I couldn’t mess up the
“Airport fare.” I appreciate the combination of Local and Regional to make the system easier to
understand. And I know you’ll get complaints about the Airport fare being higher, but let’s be real for most people it is more cost effective than the alternatives of parking or Ubering, and if you can get
to the airport for less than $10 some other way, good for you and travel that way. The fact that you
don’t have a higher airport charge for discount customers and that youth are free relieves any angst I
might have about having a higher airport fee. If kids, low income families, seniors and folks with
disabilities can get to the airport cheaply, the business and casual travelers can pay $10. It looks like

RTD is listening to what its customers are asking for and I appreciate that. Hopefully this process will
show support for free fares for youth so school districts or state or local government will fund the
program.

The consolidation of local and regional fares is great. I would suggest keeping whole dollar amounts
as the fares to better facilitate cash transactions. $3 for 3 hr and $5 for day seems like a better pricing
structure in my opinion. $6 is harder to do with cash if you don't have exact change since it's a huge
loss to feed in a 10.
We should absolutely be providing free public transit for youth. Also, if public transportation in
Denver was better structured (as in does not take significantly longer then other modes of
transportation or is more direct) then more people would use it. I talk to people all the time who
want to ride buses and trains but it is simply not reasonable for their needs.
Getting rid of the regional fare is one of the smartest things RTD can do. The lower monthly rate is
fantastic, and I think youth riders should ride free always. As a daily rider, I'm excited about these
changes.
Under 19 free will get young people in habit of jumping on a bus something Denver needs
desperately.
I like that local and regional are the same fare. however, the new suggested fares are still higher than
other major cities. Chicago charges $2.25 for bus fare and $5 for airport. Houston charges $1.25 for
bus fare. Austin, which has a comparable cost of living charges $1.25 for single rides, $2.50 for day
passes. We can do better for people who rely on buses for transportation!
Without a car, I rely heavily on RTD to get to and from work. A reduced fare structure would help with
my household budgeting and make public transport a way more feasible option for some of my
coworkers stuck in traffic or who have to rely on rideshares!
There used to be so many airport employees who rode with RTD and have since stopped to the the
outrageous monthly pass cost. The new fare structure should increase ridership in the future . Thank
you
I think the proposed fare structure looks great, especially the lower monthly pass price. I work with so
many at the airport who won’t buy a monthly pass since they think $200 is too much. I think the
proposed new fare structure will increase ridership. Thanks!
sounds like an easier option. I'm in favour. Just wish to have it feel safe to ride RTD again, including
light rail. It's been awhile, and the news continues to paint a disturbing picture. Even the choice of
Chestnut Pavillion for a next community meeting is kind of scary, based on my experiences at that
location. Thanks.
it is simply criminal to charge 5.25 to get from longmont to boulder. To get to and from work i pay
that twice a day and it amounts to over 30% of my bi weekly paycheck. i may as well lyft or do really
anything but use rtd. this is public transportation make it accessible to the public.
Wonderful changes being proposed. They could be even better: Find a fare for Discount passengers
that doesn’t require having change. Make free youth fare permanent. Find a way to allow
homeless people without address to qualify for discount fare. Thank you for your good work!

I’m writing to share my support and concerns about the proposed changes to the RTD fare and pass
structure. I’m happy RTD is simplifying the structure and reducing the cost for all riders but especially
frequent riders through the monthly pass. I’m also glas to see the free fares for youth pilot program,
and consolidation of the discount programs into one. I’m concerned about a few barriers to true
accessibility and affordability. The 3-hour passes, by requiring exact change, will mean many folks
who pay with cash on the bus will end up paying more. Additionally, I’d like RTD to remove some of
the requirements to qualify for discounted passes that prevent access for folks who need transit
accessibility the most. I’d also like RTD to prioritize finding funding for a permanent free fares for
youth program. These changes would make our transit system truly accessible and affordable. I know
these require increased funding, and I urge RTD to pursue partnerships with the state for these
changes. However, while these changes are good, the most important thing RTD could do to better
serve the community and increase ridership is BETTER SERVICE—more frequent and expansion into
newer developments that currently have limited or car required service. I’ve been riding RTD and its
predecessors since the 1950s and service never gets better. Thank you.
How are you going to be able to keep enough coins in the ticket kiosks to return 30 cents for every 3
dollar bills inserted for my discount fare? Are you going to return to having discount ticket books
available for purchase? (One of the two kiosks at Southmoor has been down since before the
pandemic!)
I'm actually just curious who is taking in these comments. Is it GBSM? Just curious. Thanks!
This makes a good deal more sense, as monthly passes will probably be used by actual city residents,
not just tourists.
Would love to see these fares lowered for more equity! This makes the monthly pass much more
appealing
Thank you for proposing to lower the fee for the train to the airport. It was always odd to me how the
current fee is so much higher than other major cities in which I've lived. The blue line from downtown
Chicago to OHare is $5. The MARTA in Atlanta is $2.50 flat rate anywhere. Ridership will increase with
lower fees. Thank you for recognizing this!

rather this is a comment on the accessibility and privilege it takes to use RTD at all. This past Sunday
4/16, for example, I had to take the trains to get down to Arapahoe in DTC by 11:30 am. According to
my Maps and Transit map, the easiest route was taking the H to the E train. However, when arrived to
the 18th/Stout stop for the H train, it had been cancelled for reasons of which I do not know. So then I
had to wait an additional 20 minutes for the next H train. When that H train came, I took it, no
problem, and transferred to the E train. As I was taking the E train, everyone was removed from the
train at Southmoor and we had to wait another 15 minutes for the next E train. So I was over 30
minutes late to my destination. Had I been an employee relying on this, the schedule would have

I really do not agree with lowering regional and airport fares. It goes against your own equity analysis
and just reduces revenue. Local fares are too high, but the bulk of the savings goes to regional and
airport fares. Reducing those fares is not going to move the needle on ridership as much as better
and more frequent transit within Denver. The A line will always have trouble competing with
personal transport. Ditto with regional rail, especially lines with less frequency than the A, like all of
them. Focus more on Denver and less on your regional partners. There is much more to gain in terms
of equity, ridership, climate and air quality. The price is too high for local transit, yes, but the real
problems are frequency of service and travel times and safety concerns.
Make RTD free forever. Drivers seemed much happier and it's 85% paid for by taxes anyway
I think that restructing fairs for everyone in the RTD area will be a great thing. I have friends that do
not have much money to get RTD to different places and doing this, I think would be good for them.
Also families with children, this too will assist them with getting to baseball games, schools and family
outings. Thanks in advance!
$88 is more reasonable for a monthly pass, although still overpriced (as an example, Chicago offers a
monthly pass for $75 and Omaha, a city with a similar size to Denver, offers one for $55). I would love
to ride the bus everyday bot it is cheaper for me to drive my car. The monthly rate needs to be set at
a rate that makes it a reasonable choice.
This is SO MUCH BETTTER than the current structure it's not even funny. Please, please, *please*
ensure that this goes into place. The simplification of the fare structure will provide huge benefits in
terms of day-to-day usability, and making passes only $88/month is a huge benefit to increasing
ridership.

As for the fare structure, I think that the proposed structure is more equitable...but I must add that I
was in Miami earlier this year, and their transit system doesn't require a special card...all of the buses
and trains have an option to just tap your credit or debit card to pay the fare. As for "programs" I am
very disappointed that the Boulder bus station has remained closed for many months...through the

I used to take the A train to the airport from 40th. Why should I pay $10.00 for 2 stops? That's why I
don't take it anymore. It needs to be adjusted for where you get in to the airport. I can hitch a ride for
less than $20 round trip and not have to pay for parking on top of that.

It would be wonderful if the rate for non-profit organizations and bulk purchases were lowered. All
our students are blind and in an independence program and buy monthly passes--we are
strengthening their travel skills and they will continue to ride public transportation because of this
training.
No cost fare for students would be very helpful for our students here at Lotus that utilize Public
transit. We are a charter and do not have busing so many of our students take RTD.
I think the suggested fare changes are great. They are much easier to understand and a lot more
realistic for people to afford. Lower cost will encourage more people to use public transportation.
However, you have to do something about the smelly homeless people taking up several seats on the
lightrail. I would use it more, but I know I will have to encounter smelly homeless people and have to
suffer through that the entire ride. I also wonder what they have done to my seat before I arrived. It is
very discouraging because I want to use public transportation more.
Wow, something that makes sense from RTD. Nice work and historical occasion - first time I can recall
RTD not making a bone-headed decision. Now on to Boulder/Longmont light rail please....
After reading about the recommended fare structure, thanks, I like it, but please accept this
comment: I avoid using RTD because of safety issues. Recently while riding I witness an assault
(during the day) at a train station. Very distressing, an event that lingered in my thoughts for days.
Regardless of what RTD might do with rates, without acceptable behavioral norms I will continue to
avoid using RTD, both trains and buses
I think the new structure would not be a bad idea but I also think the idea of prolonging the discount
card would also not be able to battle the. Ninety instead of five years why not 7or 10 yrs?

Why is this not implemented yet? It is clear from a year of community feedback that it is wanted and
needed. It is a good first step to true Equity which would be eliminating fares altogether. The fare free
August 2022 clearly showed the impact specific to the RTD service area of increased ridership with
zero fares.
This new fare structure is much easier to understand and allows for tourists to see the city more
easily.
How will this effect the live program
I applaud RTD for putting a new fare structure on the table. The new fares actually make me want to
use transit more now to get to/from work, as it would be better for me financially. I hope the new
fares are approved!
I'm literally just voicing my support. This plan is amazing, absolutely no complaints.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Fare Structure

July 11, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
July 25, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt the fare structure recommendations from the Systemwide Fare Study
and Equity Analysis.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Bill Sirois, Senior Manager, Transit Oriented Communities
Chris Quinn, Planning Project Manager
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis (Study) was initiated in 2022. The intent of the Study
has been to explore simplifying fares to make services more equitable and easier to understand while
aligning fares with the service value provided. Unlike previous fare studies, this study was driven by a
customer-centric approach, focusing on equity, affordability, and simplicity. To ensure a communitydriven process and inclusion of voices often not heard, the project team partnered with communitybased organizations (CBOs) to assist in reaching their respective client populations. Additionally, the
project team established stakeholder groups, representing larger constituencies, through three focused
feedback panels: Equity, Pass Program, and Jurisdiction. The feedback panels used customer and
community input to provide feedback to RTD on how the fare structure could best meet the Study’s
goals (equity, affordability, and simplicity), fulfill customer and community needs, and balance trade-offs
among all goals and needs. The three feedback panels convened during each of the three engagement
milestones.
Prior to the release of the final recommendation, the Study included three primary rounds of customer
and community engagement at key milestones:
1. Milestone #1 (April/May 2022) introduced the Study and provided opportunity to comment on
the existing fare structure
2. Milestone #2 (June/July 2022) introduced conceptual fare options along with evaluation
criteria for review
3. Milestone #3 (October – December 2022) introduced two preliminary fare alternatives for
review
In developing the final recommendation for public review, the project team considered the following:

Customer and community feedback
Fare strategies to achieve the three study goals of equity, affordability, and simplicity
Impact on minority and low-income populations

During the February 14, 2023, Finance and Planning Committee meeting, staff presented a preliminary
draft recommendation for fare structure changes. The recommendation was based on customer and
community feedback received on the preliminary alternatives presented in Milestone #3. The Board was
invited to provide questions and comments on the recommendation.
Staff presented the draft fare equity analysis and addressed specific questions and comments from the
Board during the April 12, 2023, Finance and Planning Committee. Following this meeting, the project
team initiated an extensive public outreach process to gather feedback on the recommendation. The
draft fare equity analysis on the draft recommendation was released to the public for comment in
tandem with the released final fare structure recommendation.
DISCUSSION
In adopting the recommendations of the Study, the agency demonstrates its commitment to meet the
Strategic Priorities of Community Value, Customer Excellence, and Financial Success.
The project team has now completed the community outreach and public comment for the proposed fare
changes and final draft Title VI fare equity analysis. Consequently, the proposed fare changes are ready
for Board review. The following discussion is divided into five sections:
1. Community outreach activities
2. Feedback on final recommendations
3. Final recommendations summary
4. Projected ridership and revenue forecasts
5. Implementation
1. Community Outreach Activities
In the fourth and final phase of public engagement for the Study, customers and community members
had the opportunity to provide feedback on the recommended changes to the fare structure, policies and
programs through public comment. The public comment period was open from April 13 to May 24,
2023. To inform customers and community members of the proposed changes and to promote the
public comment process, the project team relied on several key communications channels and
engagement methods. These methods focused on inclusive public participation best practices outlined in
the Federal Transit Administration’s Title VI Requirements and Guidelines, including:
•
•

Virtual public hearings: Four virtual public hearings were held; two presentations were conducted
in English and two in Spanish
In-person open houses: The project team hosted two in-person open houses at locations with
easy transit access. All materials and signage were available in both English and Spanish, and

•

•

attendees could view and hear presentations as well as ask questions in English or Spanish.
American Sign Language interpretation was provided on site; additional language interpretation
was available upon request
Community events and station pop-ups: To reach customers in the communities where they live
and work, the project team hosted nine pop-up events at bus and rail stations throughout RTD’s
service area and participated in 10 community events, festivals and farmers markets. Staff also
participated in meetings facilitated by transit and planning organizations, such as the Denver
Regional Council of Governments and Denver Mobility Access Coalition, as well as RTD
community committees, including the Advisory Committee for People with Disabilities, the
Access-a-Ride Paratransit Advisory Committee and the Citizens Advisory Committee
Community partner outreach: The project team continued its collaboration with five community
partners (Athletics and Beyond, CREA Results, Denver Streets Partnership, Focus Reentry and
Una Mano Una Esperanza) who promoted Study events, educated community members about the
proposed changes, and supported community members to submit written or online comments.
The partners hosted and participated in community events, promoted on social media and via
word-of-mouth, and engaged with community members at food banks, schools, faith-based
organizations and other community spaces
Digital promotion: RTD updated its Fare Feedback website to provide an overview of the
recommended fare changes; the impact those changes would have on Local, Regional, Airport,
youth, discount and Access-a-Ride customers; adult, youth, student, organizational and employer
programs and discounts including the LiVE program expansion; the fare equity analysis and the
Study engagement to-date. The site was available in English and Spanish, with language access
instructions as well as two-page overviews of the recommendation available in more than 20
additional languages, including all of RTD’s 21 safe harbor languages
Media: RTD earned stories about the proposed fare changes and the public comment period in top
English- and Spanish-language media, including print, broadcast and radio

During this final phase of outreach, the project team members engaged with more than 2,600
community members. At the conclusion of the public comment period, 731 comments were submitted.
2. Feedback on Final Recommendations
Through the outreach process, significant support was provided for the components of the
recommendation. The following themes were present in the feedback:
Fare Structure
There was strong support for changes to the fare structure that would support the Study’s goals of
simplicity, affordability, and equity.
•

•

Simplicity: Participants expressed support for the consolidation of the Local and Regional fare
levels, indicating this would provide much needed simplicity and benefit customers who travel
longer distances
Affordability: Many commenters expressed appreciation for the reduction in costs, particularly in
an era of increasing inflation. In particular:

Packet Pg. 199

1.D.4

Commenters supported the decreased full fare monthly pass price ($88) and discount
monthly pass price ($27), explaining that this would benefit frequent transit users,
especially airport employees and regular travelers to the Denver International Airport with
the inclusion of the Airport fare within the monthly pass
o Many comments noted that the lower monthly pass price made transit more cost
competitive with driving and parking. Some previous customers indicated that the
decrease in fares would encourage them to begin using RTD services again; commenters
believed that may result in increased transit use/decrease car traffic and related
environmental benefits
o Nonprofit staff members stated the price decreases would support the needs of their
clients who may be transit-reliant or have limited financial resources
Equity: Commenters noted that transit-reliant equity populations would be well served by this
recommendation. They indicated that changes to the fare structure and discount programs would
allow individuals with disabilities, low-income customers, older adults, and community members
who are unhoused to attend appointments, travel to work or school, and make other necessary
trips without incurring significant cost burdens associated with transit. Others supported the
incorporation of the LiVE discount into Access-a-Ride fares
o

•

There were also some suggestions for further improvements to the fare structure, many of which were
considered through the fare study process but found to be financially or operationally unfeasible.
•
•

•

Simplicity: Many commenters urged RTD to have a single fare for all destinations, including
Denver International Airport
Affordability: Many commenters urged RTD to further reduce prices or provide zero-fare transit
for all customers. Some commenters indicated the Airport fare ($10) is still a financial burden and
is not a cost-competitive option, especially for groups of individuals traveling together. Some also
encouraged RTD to offer higher discounts for customers using discount programs and suggested
that discounts for older adults should start earlier to coincide with retirement
Equity: A number of commenters encouraged RTD to consider fares rounded to the nearest (and
lowest) dollar to ensure customers using cash would not overpay for service – or to ensure
drivers have change to offer to customers in return for overpayment. RTD was also encouraged
to provide additional outreach for discount programs to ensure eligible customers were aware of
their existence, with grocery stores, food banks and libraries listed as locations to promote
information and possibly offer retail options for Discount pass purchases

Zero Fare for Youth
Overwhelming enthusiasm was shown for the Zero Fare for Youth pilot program, noting that this would:
•
•
•
•

Support youth in accessing school and work
Benefit families who cannot afford fares for multiple children and incentivize larger families who
see driving as a more affordable option
Meet climate goals by encouraging additional ridership
Provide youth with independence and agency

Packet Pg. 200

1.D.4

•

Support lifelong transit use

Comments also encouraged RTD to seek long-term funding sources, potentially through the State of
Colorado, to ensure the program lasts beyond the first year.
Additional Passes and Programs
Commenters viewed the transit assistance grant program as a benefit for non-profit organizations with
limited budgets who aim to support clients with travel needs to appointments, food banks, job
interviews and others. They also voiced support for the updates to the EcoPass program and its positive
impact on commuting employees. RTD was also encouraged to consider other ways to decrease the cost
of transit for commuting employees, including those traveling to Denver International Airport.
3. Final Recommendations Summary
The final recommendations would lower fares for all customers and would simplify the fare structure by
combining the Local and Regional fares into a single fare category to be referred to as a Standard fare.
Additionally, the new structure would reward frequent customers with a less expensive Monthly Pass
which could be used for travel to all destinations, including Denver International Airport.

Adult Full Fares
For comparison purposes, the tables below provide a summary of the existing fare structure alongside
the recommended fare structure for customers paying the full fare.

Adult Discounted Fares
Under the recommendation, customers eligible for a discounted fare would be able to travel to any
destination, including Denver International Airport. The existing and recommended fares are shown in
the tables below.
Existing Fare Structure Discount Fare (Age 65+, Disabilities, Medicare)

Recommended Fare Structure

Access-a-Ride Fares
The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA)
allows transit agencies to charge up to twice the
comparable fixed-route fare for paratransit fares. The
recommended fare structure would lower fares for all Access-a-Ride customers and would remain below
the maximum permitted by ADA. The recommended structure would continue to allow Access-A-Ride
customers to use bus, rail and FlexRide services for zero fare. Additionally, the recommended structure
would introduce LiVE fare discounts for Access-A-Ride customers.
The tables below show the proposed fare structure compared with the existing structure for Access-aRide customers.

Recommended Access-a-Ride Fare Structure (Full Fare)

Packet Pg. 202

1.D.4

Recommended Access-a-Ride Fare Structure (LiVE Discount)

LiVE Program
Based on input from CBOs, the recommendation would increase the income threshold for LiVE eligibility,
while the LiVE discount would be increased from 40% to 50%, which would align with RTD’s Discount
Fare. Additionally, CBOs also expressed a need for RTD to work with community partners to better
market and expand the LiVE program. Specific recommendations for the LiVE program include the
following:
• Increase LiVE discount from 40% to 50% to align with Discount fares
• Increase income threshold from 185% to 250% of the Federal Poverty Level
• Develop a comprehensive outreach and engagement action plan
• Eliminate the requirement for an in-District address
• Explore expanding means testing beyond current system
The tables below show the current LiVE fares and the recommended fares.

Additionally, the table below illustrates the current LiVE income threshold and the recommended
threshold.

Note: Federal poverty guidelines are defined for household sizes of 1-14 people. This table provides the
2023 guidelines for 1- to 6-person households.
Zero Fare for Youth
Throughout the community engagement process, the community expressed a strong desire for
establishing a Zero Fare for Youth program. This desire spanned across all customer and stakeholder
segments. Accordingly, the recommended fare structure would introduce zero-fare transit for youth ages
19 and younger. The age-based threshold was chosen for simplicity to ensure all high school students as
well as those who are not enrolled in school or have recently graduated are covered by the program.
Given funding limitations, this program is proposed to be introduced as a one-year pilot with the intent of
seeking funding partners to continue it as a permanent program. As discussed with the Board during the
May 9, 2023, Finance and Planning Committee meeting, the one-year pilot program would begin
September 1, 2023, to coincide with the beginning of the academic year. Typically, FTA guidelines
allow fare pilot programs to run only for six months; on June 22, 2023, FTA officials approved RTD’s
request to offer the Zero Fare for Youth pilot for one calendar year, concluding August 31, 2024.

Recommended Structure

Packet Pg. 204

1.D.4

Recommended Changes to Existing Fare Programs
The proposed recommended draft alternative would also make changes to existing fare programs as
described herein.
Current Pass Programs
In response to customer requests for greater flexibility and predictability with the existing pass
programs, the recommendation would provide the following changes to the pass programs (EcoPass,
CollegePass, NECO Pass)
• Contracts would have fixed pricing for two-year periods, based on system utilization
• All trips priced will be based on full fare, Local, 3-Hour Pass price (higher Airport fare will not
apply to Pass Program participants)
• Contract minimums will be reduced to lower barriers to participation
• Pricing would be simplified
• New pricing would take effect in 2024
Bulk Purchases
While RTD currently has a program for bulk purchases, the recommendation would introduce an
expanded program based on input from CBOs, non-profits and businesses. The program would apply to
“retail” products (3-Hour Pass, Day Pass, 10-Rides, Monthly Pass). The program would not apply to
EcoPass participation or to resellers/sales outlets/vendors, such as King Soopers and Safeway. The
program would introduce a 10% discount for bulk fare purchases at or above $1,500.
Additional Administrative Details
Staff will develop program details within the recommended fare structure, in response to community and
customer input, that require additional administrative work and coordination with stakeholders.
4. Projected Ridership and Revenue Forecasts
Unlike previous fare study efforts, the Study did not assume specific revenue targets; however, the
2023-2028 Mid-Term Financial Plan (MTFP) assumes a fare revenue decrease based on the early
direction of the Study.
In addition to forecasting the revenue changes associated with a new fare structure, the effects on
ridership were also modeled. The table below illustrates 2024 forecast ridership and revenue for the
existing fare structure and the recommended alternative.

-21% to -17%

*Ranges in expected ridership and fare revenue reflect potential impacts of the Zero Fare for Youth Pilot
As shown in the table, the recommendation would increase ridership over the existing fare structure by
approximately 11% to 13%. However, the ridership increase would be accompanied by a revenue
decrease of approximately 17% to 21% (over the existing fare structure). The corresponding increase in
ridership would not be enough to offset the financial impact of the lower fares. National examples
indicate that, in general, a fare decrease will result in a loss of fare revenue, despite an increase in
ridership.
Transit customers typically have what is known as an “inelastic” response to price – that is to say, they
have limited sensitivity to price. The reduction in fare revenue, while significant, would not have a
consequential impact on RTD’s budget since only approximately 6% of RTD’s overall budget is derived
from fares. No impact to service levels in the 2024-2028 MTFP timeframe would be anticipated. This is
attributed to the fact that the MTFP assumed a fare revenue reduction starting in 2024.
5. Implementation
Most of the elements of the new fare structure would be implemented in the first quarter of 2024 with
some exceptions as follows:
• Zero Fare for Youth: As reported to the Board during the May 9, 2023, Finance and Planning
Committee meeting, the Zero Fare for Youth program would begin September 1, 2023, following
the completion of the two-month Zero Fare for Better Air period taking place in July and August
2023. The Zero Fare for Youth pilot would be a one-year program. For the pilot to be most
effective, staff recommends aligning the commencement of the program to coincide with the
start of the 2023-2024 school year.
• LiVE eligibility expansion: RTD currently relies on the State of Colorado PEAK system to
determine eligibility for the LiVE program. Colorado PEAK is an online service where residents can
apply for medical, food assistance, and other benefits. A substantial lead-up time is required to
change the eligibility requirements within the system. Staff has begun discussions with
appropriate state staff to ensure that the changes can be set into the system as soon as possible
after Board approval; however, the date of implementation for those changes may not correspond
with the implementation of other elements of the fare structure
FINANCIAL IMPACT

Packet Pg. 206

1.D.4

As noted in the Discussion section of this report, the recommendation would decrease fare revenue by
approximately 17% to 21% compared with the existing fare structure. The reduction in fare revenue,
while significant, would not have a consequential impact on RTD’s budget since only approximately 6%
of RTD’s overall budget is derived from fares. No impact to service levels in the 2024-2028 MTFP
timeframe would be anticipated. This is attributed to the fact that the MTFP assumed a fare revenue
reduction starting in 2024. The financial impact will be included in the MTFP and budget appropriation
recommended actions.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
2023 Amended Budget

July 11, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
July 25, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt Resolution No. ___, Series of 2023, to amend and appropriate funds
to decrease the 2023 Amended Budget by $117.2 million to $2,092.9 million.

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
Todd Nikkel, Senior Manager, Budget
BACKGROUND
RTD may amend its annual budget at any time during the fiscal year, with Board approval. Budget
amendments are requested primarily when new information or unplanned activities arise, since the
Approved Budget appropriation, that require additional funding, reductions to funding or reallocation of
funds to the appropriate projects, accounts and cost centers. RTD’s budgetary controls require Board
appropriation of funding in order to authorize staff to expend those funds for specified needs.
DISCUSSION
The 2023 Adopted Budget was appropriated by the Board in November 2022. This budget amendment
reflects changes that have occurred in the intervening period to adjust for revised revenue assumptions
and modifications to certain expenditure appropriations.
Fiscal Policy Adherence
The Board approved the 2023 Fiscal Policy in October 2022. The following are key components of the
2023 Fiscal Policy and explanations regarding the extent to which this 2023 Amended Budget adheres
to those requirements:
RTD will contract with a third party to provide sales and use tax forecasts: The 2023 Amended
Budget includes the March 2023 sales and use tax forecast from the University of Colorado
Leeds School of Business
Priority will be given to replacement of existing, backlog and deferred assets before consideration
of new assets: The 2023 Amended Budget provides funding for maintenance and replacement
needs according to the Transit Asset Management Plan

Packet Pg. 231

1.D.5

RTD will strive to maintain a fund balance equivalent to three months of operating expenses,
excluding depreciation, for unanticipated expenditures and increases in costs as well as to
mitigate service disruptions during economic downturns: The 2023 Amended Budget fund
balance exceeds three months of operating reserves
RTD will maintain a minimum net revenue coverage ratio (revenues available for debt service
after subtracting operating expenses) of 1.2 times: The 2023 Amended Budget results in a 1.5
times revenue coverage ratio
FINANCIAL IMPACT
