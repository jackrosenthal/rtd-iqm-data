GM TACTICAL PLAN FOR 2016
Strategic Goal #1
Fiscal Sustainability

Throughout its history, RTD has had to adapt its service levels and capital programs to
different financial conditions due to the variability in sales and use taxes, its largest source
of revenue. One of the strategic goals established by the RTD Board for 2016 relates to
fiscal sustainability in order for RTD to continue to achieve its mission to meet its
constituents' transportation needs in a cost-effective manner. As a part of this goal, the
Board and staff identified specific focus areas:










Increased Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Costs
Impact of the New Fare Structure
Affordable Fares
Identification of New Revenue Sources
Increase in Existing Revenue Streams
Parking Revenue
Service Levels, Revenue Rates and Utilization of Unused Capacity (Ridership)
Partnerships
Avoiding “Mission Creep”

Each of these areas will be addressed in 2016, with the overall intent of planning for the
delivery of fiscally sustainable and innovative financial plans for the six-year time horizon
of the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP), and through the 2040 horizon year of the DRCOG
Regional Transportation Plan (RTP).
Increased Operations and Maintenance (O&M) costs
Increases in O&M costs will occur in 2016 from two primary areas: 1.) inflation and wage
increases, and 2.) growth in service from five corridor openings.
Those openings include the East Line, Gold Line, Northwest Rail Segment, I-225 and Bus
Rapid Transit (BRT). As revenue service begins on each of these elements, expenditures
will shift from capital to operations.
RTD has included these projected operating costs in its financial forecasts. RTD is carefully
planning the allocation of resources for 2016. For a significant portion of those costs,
RTD has budget certainty in that contracted service payments will be made to the
concessionaire for the East Line, Gold Line and Northwest Rail Segment. The O&M costs
for I-225 and BRT have been projected according to historical O&M costs.
Additional projections for O&M support services such as Security, Administration, Finance,
etc., are also being carefully evaluated. Many of the supporting costs are shared by both
the Base System and FasTracks. An allocation methodology and identification of direct
costs will be applied to ensure costs are recorded where incurred. Because the Base
1

Packet Pg. 10

Attachment: GM Tactical Plan 2016 - Goal 1 Fiscal Sustainability (01) (2351 : 2016 Strategic Goals)

Background

1.B.1.c

System and FasTracks are evaluated separately as a result of FasTracks funding not being
available for the Base System, RTD will focus its efforts to apply costs to each fund
accurately with a utilization-based allocation. This will also provide for more accurate
financial analysis of results and performance.

Impact of New Fare Structure
The financial impact of the proposed new fare structure has been carefully evaluated by
the fare study contractor CH2M. The proposed changes have been modeled using
expected ridership and fare program participation data to provide reasonable assurance
that the SBP fare revenue targets are met to ensure fiscal sustainability. Staff will closely
monitor and analyze the fare collection results upon implementation.
Affordable Fares
“Affordable fares” has been identified as a strong concern by certain parties through the
fare study public participation process.
The financial impact of affordable fares,
specifically defined as discounted fares for low income residents, is being modeled under
different proposed scenarios. Note that any increased fare reductions or expanded
distribution of discounted fare products beyond RTD’s long-standing Non-Profit Agency
Reduced Fares program will have additional, negative revenue impacts to RTD. RTD is
working closely with low-income resident interest groups to identify possible changes or
additions to the Non-Profit Agency Reduced Fares program that can balance the needs of
low-income riders with ensuring that any negative impact to revenue can be mitigated for
fiscal sustainability. The financial impact of these scenarios is being modeled and, if
implemented, will be closely monitored and analyzed.
Identification of New Revenue Sources
In accordance with the Fiscal Sustainability Task Force recommendations, RTD will
continue to pursue new or additional revenue opportunities including:




Corporate sponsorships and naming rights contracts
Evaluation of monetizing parking facilities
Evaluation of fare pass programs

In addition, RTD will continue to explore revenue sources such as the sale of assets and
easements not required for transit purposes, leasing and contracting for the operation and
management of assets that can be operated by third parties at a cost savings, and
developing shared facilities where RTD and developers can combine resources and reduce
costs for both site development and operating costs. RTD will also continue to assess
other program funding or acceleration opportunities as they arise, such as federal and
state grants.

2

Packet Pg. 11

Attachment: GM Tactical Plan 2016 - Goal 1 Fiscal Sustainability (01) (2351 : 2016 Strategic Goals)

Fiscal sustainability for these costs will be monitored closely to ensure they fall within the
forecasted amounts.

1.B.1.c

Increase in Existing Revenue Streams






Implementation of proposed fare structure to meet SBP target
Increased sales tax revenue through exemption parity with the State
Continuing partnership with the Department of Revenue to verify tax compliance
and reporting of RTD sales/use tax collections
Enhanced collection of ridership data for pass pricing

Parking Revenue
In 2015, RTD received an unsolicited proposal to monetize parking. RTD determined that
the proposal had merit and, with Board Approval, decided to further investigate the
possibility of producing additional revenue from its parking facilities.
Currently RTD has a contractor that provides parking services in which RTD shares in
parking revenues above a certain threshold. With the addition of several new parking
facilities in 2016, RTD will further evaluate their most efficient financial use.
Several concerns must be considered including private use, federal interest, and elasticity
of fares and parking rates. RTD is undertaking additional internal evaluation of the
financial potential of these facilities.
Service Levels and Revenue Rates
RTD staff and Board continue to focus on RTD's mission to meet our constituents' present
and future public transit needs by offering safe, clean reliable, courteous, accessible and
cost-effective service throughout the District. These services include fixed route bus
service, light rail service, paratransit services for the general public (Call-n-Ride) and transit
services for individuals with disabilities (Access-a-Ride) as well as services provided by
partner agencies and supported by RTD (van pools, etc.). Staff will continue to work with
the Board of Directors to ensure that services are delivered in an efficient manner while
also recognizing the financial realities facing the organization.
In order to ensure that services continue to meet the ever-changing needs of our
community, RTD implements service changes three times per year: in January, May when
school lets out, and in August when school resumes. The timing of these changes is set
forth in RTD’s Collective Bargaining Agreement with represented employees. Under normal
circumstances, these service changes or "run boards" in our jargon, allow RTD to adjust
the levels of transit service provided to better correspond to the level of service needed by
our customers. These service changes also provide the means by which RTD adjusts levels
of service to conform to prevailing economic conditions and responds to changes in
operating conditions.

Attachment: GM Tactical Plan 2016 - Goal 1 Fiscal Sustainability (01) (2351 : 2016 Strategic Goals)

RTD will continue to pursue opportunities to increase existing revenue streams including:

1.B.1.c









The performance of these services (measured by ridership) based upon RTD Service
Standards (ridership per hour of transit service provided, subsidy per passenger
boarding, etc.);
The effects of the potential changes on the overall transit network (system
impacts) and on transit dependent riders;
The availability of reasonable alternative transit services;
The ability to enhance services when possible given financial circumstances;
The distribution/impacts of such changes throughout the District and throughout
the RTD Family of Services (Local, Express, Regional, Call-n-ride, LRT, etc.); and
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act to be sure that services are equitably provided
without regard to race, color, national origin, etc.

In addition to the above referenced service planning considerations, RTD Service Planning
staff works closely with RTD Finance to ensure that service adjustments reflect the
financial realities of the organization. This includes the impact on revenue rates.
The consideration of these issues provides a systematic, objective and rational framework
within which RTD staff can evaluate potential changes in services in order to maximize
ridership and optimize the use of RTD's resources.
In many ways, "service standards" could also be referred to as "expectations" as they
reflect what RTD's performance expectations are in terms of ridership and subsidy for a
service (route) to be considered successful. The purpose of the standards is to help
identify routes that are most in need of service changes in order to maximize ridership and
optimize the use of RTD's resources.
In applying these standards, RTD's guidelines call for routes falling below the lowest 10%
productivity threshold based on either subsidy per passenger boarding or passengers
boarding per service hour, or below the lowest 25% productivity threshold for both
measures, to be evaluated for marketing, revision, or as a last resort, possible elimination.
These are not the sole criteria as RTD's service standards also take into account services
provided to areas of high transit dependency, and RTD staff also considers the existence
of alternative transit services in a given area when developing service recommendations.
The process to implement service changes consists of:





RTD staff develops a set of initial service change recommendations for
consideration;
RTD staff presents the initial recommendations to the Board of Directors and
presents these initial recommendations to the public for public comment;
RTD staff holds public meetings in areas throughout the District that would
potentially be impacted by the proposed changes;
RTD staff develops a final set of proposed service changes based on the initial
recommendations and potential modifications based on public comment, and;
4

Packet Pg. 13

Attachment: GM Tactical Plan 2016 - Goal 1 Fiscal Sustainability (01) (2351 : 2016 Strategic Goals)

When evaluating potential changes in RTD services, RTD staff considers several factors.
Primary among these service planning guiding principles are:

1.B.1.c



RTD staff presents the final service change proposals to the Board of Directors for
final approval and/or modification by Board action.

In order to support the Board of Directors in their policy deliberations, staff provides
detailed ridership information, cost information and revenue information to help identify the
rationale behind service change recommendations. These recommendations are discussed
at both Operations/Customer Services Committee meetings and Board meetings. Staff also
presents annual service evaluation reports to the Board of Directors to help communicate
the performance of the various services provided by RTD. Staff also stands prepared to
assist with the conduct of any workshops/study sessions on this topic that might be
desired by the Board of Directors.
Partnerships
RTD will continue to identify opportunities to enhance its revenues, reduce its capital and
operating costs, and provide new and innovative long-term financing opportunities through
partnerships. Potential strategies to do so include, but are not limited to, the following:













Pursuit of partnerships with FasTracks stakeholders to obtain additional local match
funds to complete FasTracks corridors
Implementation of private public partnerships proposals for FasTracks, and for other
projects that provide benefits to RTD and fit within the financial plans
Completion of FTA New Starts process and local participation for the Southeast Rail
extension
Contracting to provide O&M services on the North Metro Rail Line
Pursuit of a long-term solution to maintaining and operating on the 16th Street Mall
Endorsing and supporting efforts to collect sales tax revenues on internet sales
Leasing and contracting for the operation and management of assets that can be
operated by third parties at a cost savings, such as parking facilities
Development of shared facilities including parking, transfer centers, plazas,
walkways and bike-facilities at transit oriented or joint development projects where
RTD and developers can combine resources and reduce costs for site development
and amenities and operating cost
Sale of assets and easements that do not interfere with existing or future RTD
operations
Sale of other assets not required for transit purposes
Continued pursuit of federal and state competitive grants as opportunities arise

Avoiding “Mission Creep”
In meeting the Board’s goal of Fiscal Sustainability, RTD will focus on its core mission “To
meet our constituents’ present and future public transit needs by offering safe, clean,
reliable, courteous, accessible and cost-effective service throughout the District”. As
5

Packet Pg. 14

Attachment: GM Tactical Plan 2016 - Goal 1 Fiscal Sustainability (01) (2351 : 2016 Strategic Goals)

The entire service change process usually takes a period of 3-4 months from the time of
development of the initial service change proposal until implementation of the service
adjustments.

1.B.1.c

such, RTD will avoid efforts that extend beyond its mission.

Based on the Regional Transportation Plan prepared by DRCOG and the goals and
objectives adopted by the Board of Directors, RTD develops its six-year SBP each year.
The SBP is a fiscally constrained plan which presents aggregate projected service levels
and capital and expense projects expected to be undertaken for the next six years.
Projects are evaluated based on their relative costs and benefits, how well they meet the
RTD mission statement, and these projects are constrained to operate within the forecast
of revenues available for their completion and operation. The first year of the SBP capital
and operating program serves as the basis for the preparation of the annual budget.
During the development of the SBP and Budget, RTD staff will provide the Board with
relevant information and deliver frequent updates. The Board is given the opportunity to
offer early and substantive input into the development of RTD's budget plans. Once the
SBP and Budget are adopted by the Board, RTD staff will maintain controls throughout the
year and deliver the service as approved by the Board.
The FasTracks Team conducts an annual program evaluation (APE) of scope, schedule,
costs and revenues to modify the program as necessary to meet goals. The APE allows the
agency to address trends and to make necessary modifications to the program while
keeping our commitment to be fiscally responsible, efficient and cost-effective. The
process allows RTD to be proactive in making prudent management decisions and
establishing strategies for cost containment, value engineering and innovation to complete
the program as soon as possible. In addition, in 2014 DRCOG has extended the time
horizon of the RTP from 2035 to 2040. As part of that process, RTD will be re-examining
its financial plan for the completion of FasTracks to identify other opportunities to
complete additional projects within the extended time horizon of the RTP.
RTD will continue to explore cost savings as part of the Fiscal Sustainability Task Force
recommendations as follows: 1) service optimization to match the cost of services
provided with available funding sources, 2) technology and energy innovation that involves
lighting upgrades and energy efficiency in building systems expected to produce
quantifiable cost savings, and 3) partnerships and privatizations that could include such
items as privatizing routes and administrative and operational functions to reduce
expenses. Finally, RTD will manage its financial condition by 1) reducing the volatility of
sales and use tax projections by continuing its contract with the CU-Leeds School of
Business for improved quarterly sales and use tax forecasting, and 2) adhering to its fund
balance policy based on recommended best practices and to include a Board-appropriated
fund and capital acquisition fund.

Attachment: GM Tactical Plan 2016 - Goal 1 Fiscal Sustainability (01) (2351 : 2016 Strategic Goals)

RTD will develop and implement a Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) and annual Budget for
Board approval. These plans will include innovative approaches to balance the SBP and
Budget in order to sustain service delivery and implement to the degree possible the Fiscal
Sustainability Task Force recommendations and the General Manager 2016 goals as
established by the Board.

1.B.1.d

GM TACTICAL PLAN FOR 2016
Strategic Goal #2
Opening of Five FasTracks Rail and BRT Corridors in 2016

The FasTracks program currently has over $5.5 billion committed for completed and
ongoing construction projects. In 2016, five (5) major corridors are planned to open for
revenue service to the public. These include the US36 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) project;
the East Rail Line to Denver International Airport; the Northwest Electrified Segment
(NWES) to Westminster; the Gold Line to Arvada and Wheat Ridge; and the I-225/Aurora
Line through the City of Aurora.
Opening so many lines in a single year is unprecedented and will require a full commitment
of staff and resources to achieve successfully. Accomplishment of this task will
underscore the success of FasTracks and continue to build confidence of the public in
RTD’s ability to deliver. The following areas are addressed:







Complete projects on time and within budget
Complete integrated testing and pre-revenue testing
Rail activation
Marketing/Special events/communication/community partnering
Service planning/bus operations/integration
Staffing, internal and external

The description below provides the tactical approaches to accomplishing this goal.
Complete Corridor Construction Projects On-Time and Within Budget
RTD has a tradition of completing its corridor construction projects on-time and within
budget. This is a commitment to the public and communities that has proven to be very
successful. Obviously, the construction projects must be completed before opening the
projects to passengers. These construction projects are vast undertakings, which have
thousands of inter-related tasks needing to be done within tight timeframes.
RTD assigns project teams to closely oversee the progress of each project. These multidisciplinary teams work closely with the contractors, stakeholders and state and federal
agencies to address any obstacles to completion. They also oversee contractor schedules,
monitor the budget and remaining contingency and oversee safety and quality. We will
assure that adequate resources are maintained on the project teams as the work is
completed.
Complete Integrated Testing and Pre-Revenue Testing
Once a train is ready to move under its own power, then the integrated testing period can
begin. Integrated testing involves the checkout of more than one system (such as vehicle,
signals and traction power) in the actual operating environment. It generally involves

1
Packet Pg. 16

Attachment: GM Tactical Plan 2016 - Goal 2 Opening of FT and BRT (2351 : 2016 Strategic Goals)

Background

dynamic testing with the movement of train(s). Each integrated test is closely monitored
to assure that it meets the criteria and safety requirements for a successful test under the
direction of a test director. One of the more significant sets of integrated tests is those at
each grade crossing. Each at-grade crossing is tested to assure that proper warning times
for bells and gates are provided, that any adjacent traffic signals preempt according to
standards, that crossing gates operate properly and that all Public Utility Commission
requirements are achieved. Each track in each direction must be tested. Each test result is
fully documented.
Pre-revenue testing is done after integrated testing is complete. It closely replicates actual
operating conditions without passengers to verify and make adjustments to the projected
schedules. The testing also provides the opportunity for train operating and maintenance
personnel to acquire familiarity, training and certification on the new alignments. The RTD
maintainers utilize this opportunity to conduct pre-opening inspections and adjustments
which provides additional safety and familiarity of the equipment. Thus, a robust training
program (both classroom and field) is provided for transportation and maintenance
personnel.
A robust safety certification process is also to be implemented by RTD. Each safety
certifiable element is tracked from design, through construction and testing to assure that
it meets safety criteria. The system will not be opened to the public unless the safety
certification process has demonstrated acceptable progress. A safety certification plan
guides the overall process.
RTD assigns oversight teams to monitor and conduct the requisite testing. On the Eagle
P3 project, the concessionaire – DTP – will be performing the testing program which also
includes the acceptance of the Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility (CRMF). However,
RTD will maintain a strong oversight role to assure that DTP achieves RTD, federal and
state requirements. In addition, the contract provides for an Independent Engineer who
provides the final sign-off that the system is ready to open to the public.
On the I-225 project, RTD personnel will be directly involved in the testing program.
Hiring and training programs are implemented to assure that adequate personnel are
available for the new services.
Rail Activation
Five (5) rail/BRT corridors are scheduled to open in 2016. To assure the planning and
implementation of each corridor is a smooth and successful process; an activation team
for each corridor has been established to monitor the progress of start-up planning and
implementation. Each activation team is responsible for coordinating and monitoring the
project tasks/ sub-tasks, staff assignments, and timelines as developed and approved by
the RTD General Manager and Senior Leadership Team and is directed to achieving the
ultimate goal of implementing each corridor on time and within budget. The activation
teams include Senior Managers and representatives from each department within the
agency.

1.B.1.d

The second year of the activation process begins to focus on systems integration testing
as the project construction nears completion.
All systems integration tasks and
responsibilities for each department are included in each activation process.
The
implementation of the Integrated Testing Plan (ITP) is monitored through the activation
process including monitoring all safety and security items that need to be certified for
operations acceptance of the project. The IT components needed for each project are
tracked through the activation process leading up to opening day and training of new
personnel for each department is also tracked. The activation teams will also begin
preparing for the opening of each of the corridors. Station festivities, the volunteer effort
and safety and security measures for the grand opening events will be discussed through
the activation processes.
Marketing /Special Events/Communication/Community Partnering
The combined impact on our resources and employees of properly promoting to the
general public, engaging our stakeholders and elected officials, and educating would-be
passengers regarding the five new major transit investments opening in a single year
presents unique challenges and opportunities. These new services will spread out across
approximately half of the Denver Metro area, representing significant infrastructure
improvements for the municipalities through which they travel. RTD has previously
enjoyed at least one year between our major transit project openings, allowing for
lengthened public awareness campaigns and “ramp up” prior to the actual openings.
To accommodate the short timeframes between the five 2016 openings, RTD will engage
in very focused and targeted public relations and media relations efforts, including earned
media through community, local, regional, national and international outlets,
advertisements in publications that participate in our advertising trades, electronic
newsletters, website ads and publications, and social media, among other efforts.
Increased levels of education, above and beyond what is currently underway, about safety
around rail service, how to access the new services, and general public awareness of RTD
delivering on the voter-approved investment are key components to the opening activities.
Considerable energy is focused on ensuring that messaging, public engagement and public
information is created, provided and communicated via numerous channels to properly
reach all parties concerned.
In order to support the required level of public events – the cumulative event lineup for
2016 will include a total of twenty events comprising at least sixteen event days – RTD
will mobilize a large number of volunteer ambassadors, RTD employees who volunteer
their time to directly help educate the public on how to use the new transit improvement.
Early estimates for volunteer shifts are projecting a need for up to 4,000 volunteer shifts

3

Attachment: GM Tactical Plan 2016 - Goal 2 Opening of FT and BRT (2351 : 2016 Strategic Goals)

The activation process for each corridor began approximately two (2) years before the
estimated grand opening date. The first year of the activation process focuses on budget,
staffing, and the development of the bus and rail service plans. The construction schedule
is monitored as the projects move closer to integrated testing. Staffing and resources for
integrated testing are discussed through the activation process. The recruitment process
is also monitored through the activation process.

1.B.1.d

staffed by up to 700 actual volunteers; nearly triple the amount for our largest previous
events.

RTD has established successful benchmarks for these public activities over the past
several years. For example, attendance for our public events, free ride days and station
parties has been tremendous, and we are planning to meet and even exceed RTD’s
traditional levels of success with creative solutions that will positively impact each of the
grand openings.
Service Planning/Bus Operations/Integration
Opening of five (5) new corridors also demands major resources from Bus Operations.
First, the US36 project will be RTD’s first BRT operation (Flatiron Flyer). Major work is
already underway in terms of schedule planning, bus procurement, marketing and branding
and public outreach. In 2016, the corridor will see full implementation of BRT service on
US36. This will include operation on the managed lanes, bus on shoulder operation and
new stations. Training of bus operators for this new service will be a major focus, as well
monitoring of the new operation for any identified improvements.
Also, there will be major changes in bus operations throughout the new rail corridors.
Many bus routes will be re-oriented to serve the new rail stations and optimize intermodal
connections. This requires revamping both routes and schedules. These new service
plans are developed and presented to the public, which provides input to the proposed
new services, these service plans are then presented to the RTD Board for approval. A
major training program is implemented to orient bus operators to the new routes and
schedules.
The operation of the new services will be closely monitored after
implementation to identify any desirable adjustments.
Many new rail operations personnel come from bus operations. For new rail corridors, this
typically requires bus operations to backfill these positions. Therefore, hiring and training
programs are expanded in bus operations to assure that service is not negatively impacted
by the transition of personnel.
Staffing, Internal and External
Each department affected by the project openings has developed staffing and contracting
plans to identify staff and resources necessary for successful opening, operation and
maintenance. These plans are included in the development of the SBP and the 2016
budget processes. The plans are also tracked in the project activation processes.

GM TACTICAL PLAN FOR 2016
Strategic Goal #3
Technology

Technology is integral to the day-to-day and strategic operations of RTD. It is Information
Technology's (IT) mission to work in partnership with the public and RTD business units to
provide innovative, effective, technology solutions that meet and advance RTD's strategic
goals. RTD strives to stay ahead of technological solutions the business units and the
public expect. It is also Communication’s mission to enhance communications with the
public through the progressive use of effective, reliable, and immediate digital
communication channels to inform and engage riders. To that end, several projects are
planned for 2016 that will increase effectiveness of RTD staff, improve services to our
riders, and provide information to the RTD management team that will enhance decision
making. The Board of Directors identified the following areas as goals for Technology:

Security
IT is expanding on its 2015 advances in IT security governance, awareness campaigns,
training, cross-agency collaboration, and cyber-incident response to perform industry
regulatory compliance and security best practice assessments for targeted critical, at-risk
areas of the business, such as systems that process credit cards, the website, and control
systems networks. Additionally, IT continues to mature RTD’s internal proactive security
stance by enabling procedural controls such as architectural reviews, access control
management and testing/auditing; and technical controls such as network segregation and
patch management that are designed to provide better wide-spread defense and incident
detection across the networked computer systems.
IT is fully engaged with RTD Security in the roll out of new networks for capturing video at
sites throughout the district, as well as adding new DVRs on all new buses. Other
components of these efforts include the creation of an environment that allows sharing of
video, data, and live resources with other agencies for incident response and crime
prevention configured to network security best practices.

Background

1.B.1.e

Private Partnering (Innovation)

RTD is pursuing a private partnership with Xerox to host RTD’s Smart Card system. The
primary benefits of this are twofold 1) to provide industry expertise and support and 2)
create internal efficiencies by avoiding additional costs of staffing and infrastructure
support.
After implementation of Real Time Passenger Information, RTD plans to make information
available for private parties to create mobile applications that will provide real-time arrival
and departure information for bus passengers through personal mobile devices. The Digital
Communications Team will be developing an outreach plan to inform and engage mobile
application developers, and promote the availability of the new applications to riders.
As a part of the Eagle P3 project, IT is working closely with Denver Transit Partners in the
building of two new radio towers for communications. These radio resources are joint
use. RTD provided FCC licensing, requirements for the design and build of the sites, and
extended partnerships through RTD with other agencies that participate in the shared radio
and communications resources throughout the region.
RTD has interfaced with a number of local and national cybersecurity providers to bring in
top-talent to assess the network systems and recommend updates that provide RTD with
the best security return on investment. RTD has also become more involved with the
APTA Controls and Communication Systems Working Group and Enterprise IT Security
Working Groups, Infragard, Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, and other
private and public organizations for cybersecurity alerting, incident management, best
practices, and information/intelligence sharing.
Customer Facing
Providing riders with current and accurate information to enhance the rider's experience is
a key area of investment in 2016. The Communications Department is dedicated to
providing new and innovative approaches to providing timely, quality information to our
passengers. These efforts include:
Rider Facing Mobile Technologies:
The use of mobile devices to consume information is continually increasing. In 2014,
people using mobile devices to access information on RTD-Denver.com surpassed those
using a desktop or laptop (64% of all traffic came from a mobile device). In response to
this trend, the RTD website was redesigned in 2015 by the Digital Communications Team
to be mobile friendly. Communications and IT will continue to partner to explore and offer
information in formats conducive to mobile consumption. This will be accomplished
through mobile applications, automated phone systems, text messaging, and public
signage.

Packet Pg. 21

Attachment: GM Tactical Plan 2016 - Goal 3 Technology (01) (2351 : 2016 Strategic Goals)

In 2015, IT developed a roadmap on the strategic use of the Cloud to provide improved
systems and functionality at less cost to RTD. The actual implementation will take a
number of years.

1.B.1.e

Enhanced Traveler Information:
Providing predictive information regarding arrival or departure times for buses will improve
rider's experience. The first phase implemented at the end of 2015 includes reporting the
anticipated number of minutes before a bus will arrive or depart from a certain stop or
location and provides real-time information on the location of the bus. The second phase
occurring in 2016 involves providing this information for commuter rail and light rail
(dependent on funding approvals). Communications has identified and will partner with IT
to provide real-time information for 3rd party developers, Google maps, and Passenger
Information Display Signs. Also launching in 2016 will be a new mobile-friendly application
on the RTD website called Next Ride. This feature-rich application crafted in-house by the
Digital Communications Team and built in conjunction with IT will allow riders to find upto-the-minute real-time information for their stop, route, vehicle, current location, and
more.
Trip Planner:
IT started building the new and improved Trip Planner application in 2015 in conjunction
with Communications. This effort will finish in 2016 and will provide trip planning
information that is optimized for mobile devices. IT will also build a robust trip planning
application that matches the information being delivered to riders that will improve the
operations and efficiency of the customer contact center. A true collaborative effort, the
Digital Communications Team will be tasked with developing the user interface to match
RTD’s digital brand, creating a quality user experience, optimizing the interface to be
mobile-friendly, and integrating the application into the RTD website.
RTD-Denver.com Web Site:
The existing RTD website will be upgraded and migrated to a new platform in 2016 by the
Digital Communications Team in Marketing. This will provide Communications with the
ability to publish up-to-the-minute updates, enhance search engine optimization, provide
the ability for more users to contribute content in an easy to use interface, offer social
integration/commenting, and allow for a full-featured blog, among many other benefits.
The new platform will be the standard for all upcoming public-facing websites built
internally, and will allow RTD to move off of outdated legacy systems. New features and
enhancements will be added to the website over the coming years to enhance engagement
and provide a better experience for riders. The enhanced web experience will improve
information availability, improve internal processes, improve customer loyalty, drive
revenue, and increase campaign effectiveness.

Passenger Information Display Systems (PIDS) included in base projects have been
expanded to further the customer experience in RTD stations and Park-n-Ride facilities. An
additional set of PIDS at Denver Union Station and additions at Oak Street Station Park-nRide are planned for 2015-2016. FasTracks projects with PIDS components requiring
specifications, designs, and network integration include East Line (DIA bus roadway) and
US36 BRT with passenger shelters at BRT stops and bus gates at the new Boulder
Junction at Depot Square.

1.B.1.e

Prioritized Resources
RTD's business depends on reliable and accurate systems for accounting, inventory
control, security, human resources, payroll, email, procurement, communications, and
more. This requires a significant investment in infrastructure and resources including items
such as: data centers, servers, networks, desktops, databases, applications, mobile
devices, and more. 2016 efforts with an IT focus will include:
Data Network:
IT will implement corporate network upgrades that provide a solid and reliable
technological foundation for all RTD systems.
Operations and Maintenance:
Nearly 70% of all technology efforts and investments go toward keeping-the-lights-on. In
2016 there will be continued attention to technology operations, sustainable activities,
ongoing maintenance, support, and upgrades of mission critical systems. IT will begin
migrating some systems to Cloud based, managed services solutions to help cut costs,
stay up to date on technology, and assist IT with their disaster recovery plans.
Enterprise Content Management:
In 2014, RTD began a comprehensive review of its Enterprise Content Management
Systems. This entails reviewing the current systems, outlining a district-wide taxonomy to
ensure compatibility across all systems, and developing a governance process and policies
regarding enterprise content management storage and retention. In 2016 and beyond,
efforts will focus on further defining taxonomy, approving and enforcing governance
procedures and policies, consolidating content, and defining and implementing retention
policies.
Enhance Services
RTD maintains and advances the use of technology to conduct its business more
efficiently and effectively. There are several technology tools that are being applied in
2016 to this end. These efforts will include:
Business Intelligence:
Business intelligence was implemented in 2014 with a limited, "out of the box" approach
and was further developed in 2015 by providing dashboards and high level financial
information to the RTD Senior Leadership Team. IT will work with the business units to
4

Packet Pg. 23

Attachment: GM Tactical Plan 2016 - Goal 3 Technology (01) (2351 : 2016 Strategic Goals)

Website Promotions for 2016 Openings:
The Digital Communications Team will be launching specialized sub-sites for each of the
major openings in 2016 on RTD-Denver.com. The digital promotions will start months
before each opening to entice, inform, and influence riders and non-riders to use the new
commuter rail lines opening throughout the year. Each site will include service information,
fares, interactive maps, latest news, trip planning, and Grand Opening Event information.
Social media and email blasts will also be used to engage riders in digital campaigns and
giveaways for the openings.

1.B.1.e

Financial, Operations, and Ridership Data:
Expand RTD's business intelligence implementation to provide analysis, performance
management, benchmarking, predictive analysis, forecasting, ridership, day-to-day
operations, project accounting, and other analytics that will drive business value and
decision making. This will improve access to data for RTD management across the
organization.
State of Good Repair:
Continue to improve data collection, analysis, statistics, and reporting of information for
the State of Good Repair program.
SmartCard Reporting:
IT will expand existing SmartCard analytics to provide information that will improve and
sustain the day-to-day operations of the SmartCard program, enhance fraud detection and
analysis, and build and improve analytics for enforcement of smart media usage and
tracking.
Operator Self-Service Portal:
Enhance operations and driver efficiency by improving the capabilities of the Operator selfservice portal. The portal will provide information such as extra board assignments, shift
information, run numbers, headways, real-time information, and more. Real-time
information will be provided to the operators on this portal.
Partnerships to Address:
Last Mile:
IT met with DRCOG to investigate integrating RTD’s Trip Planner and real-time passenger
information with their “Interagency Traveler Information Coordination” project. This
involves making information available to the public regarding travel plans, bike and ride
options, ticketing, events, and more. An example of this can be found at
www.waytogo.org. IT will continue working with DRCOG in 2016 to explore this
opportunity.
Smart Technology/Smart Cards:
The SmartCard program went live in 2013 with deployment of over 300,000 EcoPass and
College Pass cards and over 100 platform validators. This technology provides riders with
an electronic media card they use to tap on to the bus or rail. It also provides RTD
management with information about ridership. Continued enhancements and additional
functionality include:


Replace Handheld Smart Media Readers:
The Handheld Smart Media Readers will be replaced in late 2015 into 2016 due to
aging technology. Additionally, the current devices are large and difficult to hold.
Replacing the handhelds will increase adoption of use by fare inspectors and
5

further develop and take advantage of collecting and reporting on data from across the
enterprise.







provide more security should the device be lost or stolen.
Provide Wireless Connectivity for Handheld Smart Media Readers:
Today, handheld devices must be placed in their cradles in order to receive daily
updates. This is inefficient and requires additional steps by the fare inspectors.
Incorporating wireless updates on the handheld devices will improve the frequency
of updates, improve the ability to maintain the devices on the most current
software release, and make it easier for fare inspectors to perform the updates.
MyRide:
Much like a debit card, the MyRide program allows the use of a "Stored Value" on
a card to pay for a trip. The cost of that trip is debited against the prepaid card.
This reduces the product costs of the various fare programs and provides a service
to the rider. The pilot for this complex and major deployment is anticipated in 2015
with full rollout occurring in 2016.
Smart Card Portal Enhancements:
Seen as one of the key benefits to riders, IT and Marketing will be working
together to provide a more quality user experience on the Smart Card Portal prior to
the launch of MyRide. Enhancements to the portal have already been identified and
documented by the Digital Communications Team, Sales, and Customer Care to
allow for better internal processes and an optimal experience for riders managing
their cards via the Smart Card Portal.

Integration and Advancement (Holistic Approach):
Providing the technology tools to improve rider service, gain efficiencies and reduce cost is
a key focus for 2016. These efforts include:





SmartDrive:
Implementing Smart Drives on buses will help improve driver safety and
performance. This is an ongoing effort that continues into 2016. Smart Drive is a
simple camera system designed to capture 20 seconds of video and other vehicle
data surrounding an accident. It is being installed on RTD operated vehicles by the
bus maintenance group and will be maintained by IT’s Mobile Technologies Group.
IT is also providing resources for the collection of data in the garages via Wi-Fi.
Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD):
IT will work closely with Bus Dispatch to facilitate any minor changes and
modifications that might be recommended as this system matures.
Cloud Services:
IT will begin to implement the recommendations made in the 2015 Cloud Study
Assessment thereby reducing infrastructure costs, improving security, improving
efficiencies, and providing disaster recovery for those systems migrated to these
services.

Internal:
IT will continue to advance and mature the total quality management program that has
improved IT service delivery in several areas including service desk and desktop support. IT
will further the maturity of several processes and programs established in 2014-2015
including agile development processes, program management process, security programs,
service level agreements, change management, incident response protocols, and more.

From:

Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

May 6, 2015

Board Meeting Date: May 26, 2015

Subject:

State Legislative Liaison Services Contract
Renewal

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Government Relations Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the
Interim General Manager, or his designee, to enter into an agreement for state legislative liaison services
with Brandeberry~McKenna Public Affairs (BMPA) to exercise a one-year option (June 30, 2015
through June 29, 2016) to extend Contract No. 13-DX-001, at a cost of $117,000, pursuant to the
Contract Award agreement.
BACKGROUND
Contract 13-DX-001 for State Legislative Liaison Services was signed with Brandeberry~McKenna
Public Affairs, effective July 1, 2013, and contained a provision for four (4) additional one-year option
periods. This board action would exercise the option for Year 2 of the option years. Of extreme
importance, the lobbyists are in daily contact with state legislators regarding bills that RTD seeks to have
passed, as well as regarding bills that would be harmful to RTD.
DISCUSSION
The state lobbying team provides guidance and direction for the RTD Board of Directors and staff in
their relationships with the General Assembly members. Constant monitoring of the activities within
the General Assembly and the Executive Office of the state of Colorado is required, and RTD’s
interests must be conveyed to appropriate legislators, including testifying before certain committees.
Advice and assistance in drafting legislation are also provided by the lobbying team. When RTD has
had legislation before the General Assembly, Brandeberry~McKenna has an excellent record of
making certain that these bills pass and become part of the Colorado statutes.
As part of the services, frequent contact is made with RTD staff and board members regarding various
bills in the legislature; written summary reports are issued on a weekly basis during the legislative
session; and status reports are given at the Government Relations Committee meetings while the
General Assembly is in session and as deemed necessary thereafter.
The Brandeberry~McKenna team also takes the initiative to educate state legislators on RTD issues and
projects so that these legislators understand mass transit and RTD’s mission.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Approve the Recommended Action. It is recommended by RTD’s Government Relations Committee
that the Board of Directors authorize the Interim General Manager to enter into an agreement for
state legislative liaison services with Brandeberry~McKenna Public Affairs (BMPA) to exercise a oneyear option (June 30, 2015 through June 29, 2016) to extend Contract No. 13-DX-001, at a cost of
$117,000, pursuant to the Contract Award agreement.

Proposals could be sent to interested parties, interviews conducted, and a different state lobbying
firm could possibly be selected by the Government Relations Committee and retained. This action
is not recommended because it is the consensus of the Government Relations Committee to
recommend to the Board the selection of the Brandeberry~McKenna team.
3. Do not approve the Recommended Action. Do not retain the services of a state legislative liaison
firm. This action is not recommended because it would put RTD in the position of facing
contentious and potentially harmful legislative issues with no direct legislative liaison services. It
was determined by the Government Relations Committee that the Brandeberry~McKenna team
has been very effective in pursuing the RTD state legislative agenda and will continue to
represent RTD’s interests very well in the future. This team is very familiar with RTD’s issues
and policies.

FEDERAL UPDATE FOR REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT: MAY 12, 2015


With the House in session for only 9 days during the month of May and no consensus on a
long-term revenue solution, both the House and Senate are expected to move a short-term
extension of MAP-21 before they adjourn for Memorial Day recess on May 22.



House transportation leaders plan to advance a $10 billion funding patch and policy extension
to carry Federal surface transportation programs through the end of the calendar year – and to
buy time to develop broader support for a Highway Trust Fund (HTF) revenue solution.



While they have yet to coalesce around any proposal to restore the long-term solvency of the
HTF, House leaders have made clear that two of the most talked-about revenue ideas won’t
work. Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said an increase in the Federal gas tax is “politically
impossible.” Ways and Means Chairman Paul Ryan has ruled out repatriation outside of
broader tax reform, which is moving on a slower track than MAP-21 reauthorization.



In the Senate, both Environment and Public Works Chairman Jim Inhofe and Ranking
Member Barbara Boxer believe a long-term funding bill for highways and transit should be
passed as soon as possible. Senator Boxer has even offered her own version of mandatory
repatriation tax legislation to replenish the HTF. But with the May 31 deadline quickly
approaching, Inhofe and Boxer have yet to introduce their multi-year highway bill, and the
Senate is expected to support an extension.



Chairman Inhofe does not want infrastructure funding to be tied to corporate tax reform,
believing the chances are slim that Congress can successfully move major tax legislation this
year. Instead, Senators Inhofe and Boxer are building support for a two-month extension of
MAP-21, through the end of July, which would likely require no additional revenues. This
approach aims to secure a revenue solution this summer.

House FY 2016 Transportation-HUD (THUD) Appropriations Bill:


On April 28, House Appropriators released their FY 2016 spending bill for the Department of
Transportation. In the absence of an authorization bill for FY 2016, the bill maintains FY
2015 funding levels for highway and transit formula programs funded from the HTF, but
makes cuts from last year’s levels for general-funded programs, including Capital Investment
Grants (“New Starts”) and TIGER.
o New Starts Funding: $1.92 billion, a cut of $199 million from last year, to be allocated as
follows: full funding for all projects with existing grant agreements (including the Eagle
project); only $250 million for proposed FFGAs (the President’s budget approved $792
million for projects in this category, including $92 million for the Southeast Rail
Extension); $40 million for Core Capacity; and the remainder to Small Starts.



The House Appropriations Committee has not yet announced its schedule for marking up
(i.e., amending in committee) this bill. The Senate has not yet introduced its own THUD
appropriations bill for next year.

Recent Federal Actions:


See the attached (1) Grant announcement of $150 million in FY 2015 New Starts funding for
the Eagle project; (2) FTA letter approving the Southeast Rail Extension into the New Starts
Engineering phase; and (3) Rep. Perlmutter’s Congressional Record statement on SU4T Day.

west of Nepal’s capital city, Kathmandu, was
the most powerful to hit Nepal in more than 80
years. Almost 5,000 deaths have been accounted for and, as I read this line, it is possible that this number has gone up.
The United Nations estimates that the tragedy has affected more than 8 million people
and left more than 1.4 million people in need
of food assistance. This earthquake has also
destroyed many historical and architectural
structures important to the culture of Nepal.
So I ask my fellow members to join me in
mourning with the people of Nepal and all
communities in other countries affected by the
tragic loss of life. I also want to commend the
efforts of first responders, relief agencies, private citizens, Nepal’s neighboring countries,
and the international community.
I want to thank our administration for its
quick response to help our friends in Nepal. I
urge Congress and our administration to continue our efforts in helping Nepal during this
tragic time.

Wednesday, April 29, 2015
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to recognize and applaud Denver’s Regional Transportation District (RTD) and the
many cities around the country that participated in Stand Up 4 Transportation Day this
past April 9th.
In Denver, nearly 400 people came out to
support the many forms of public transportation around Colorado, ranging from buses,
shuttles, vans, bicycles, cabs, car services,
pedicabs, light rail and rail. More than 350 organizations in U.S. cities and towns participated in the event. Stand Up 4 Transportation
Day succeeded in raising awareness about
the importance of public transportation and a
long-term, sustainable transportation authorization bill.
Stand up 4 Transportation Day was a brainchild of former General Manager and CEO of
RTD, Phil Washington. During his time with
RTD, he always pushed for surface transportation reauthorization for the future. In Phil’s
own words, ‘‘It’s time to do some nation building. But the funding is key to more access to
transit, new buses and trains, more reliable
service, less gridlock. We can’t meet the demands of our growing population and economy without a long-term commitment from
Washington.’’
I applaud Phil and Denver’s RTD for their
efforts in the Denver metro area. Our communities are more connected and our quality of
life is better for it.

HONORING JUSTICE LIVELY

HON. SUZAN K. DelBENE
OF WASHINGTON

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

Wednesday, April 29, 2015
Ms. DELBENE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to
honor Justice Lively, who on March 25, 2015,
received the Washington Boys & Girls Club
Youth of the Year Award. Justice was honored
for his achievements in overcoming a tumultuous childhood and serving as a leader in his
community.
The Youth of the Year Award has been the
highest award attainable by the national Boys
& Girls Club since 1947. Justice previously received the Skagit County Boys & Girls Club
Youth of the Year Award.
Justice’s upbringing was filled with far greater challenges than any child should face. As
a young boy, with his father deployed in the
U.S. Army and his mother frequently absent,
Justice was cared for by his oldest brother.
When his father returned, Justice was brought
into a new home with an abusive stepmother.
Just as his mother began to get her life back
together, she was killed in a car accident
when Justice was only seven years old.
When he was 10, Justice’s life finally took a
turn for the better. He was adopted by his
aunt and uncle and was brought to Mt.
Vernon, where he later joined the local Boys
& Girls Club. Today, Justice is a leader at the
club, focused on helping children. He frequently reads books to the club’s younger children as part of a class on early childhood development.
As he prepares to graduate from high
school, Justice intends to attend the Cascade
Job Corps, Skagit Valley College and Western
Washington University in pursuit of his goal of
becoming a pediatric nurse at Seattle Children’s hospital.
I want to congratulate Justice Lively on this
achievement, as well as his work with the
Skagit County Boys & Girls Club. I wish him
the best as he pursues his dream of helping
children.

HONORING
EATONVILLE,
WASHINGTON TOWN MARSHAL DOLAR
LAPLANT

HON. DAVID G. REICHERT
OF WASHINGTON

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

Wednesday, April 29, 2015
Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to
honor Eatonville, Washington Town Marshal
Dolar LaPlant who was killed in 1925 and his
daughter and great-granddaughter who fought
to see him recognized for his heroic sacrifice.
In 1925, Mr. LaPlant was 53 years old and a
Spanish-American War veteran. While on duty
as Town Marshal, just four days after stepping
into that position, he confronted a drunken
gunman who was firing shots and narrowly
missing small children at a playground. Mr.
LaPlant did not stop to think about his own life
or the fact that he was unarmed. He simply
did everything in his power to ensure that his
town was kept safe. The gunman shot Mr.
LaPlant just below his right ear before he was
knocked unconscious. Mr. LaPlant achieved
his mission but would later die from the wound
he received.
For many years, his heroic actions went
unremembered except by his family, particularly his daughter Rosa and his great-granddaughter Ronda. In 1999, Ronda succeeded
in having Dolar LaPlant added to the National
Law Enforcement Memorial Wall and now her
great-grandfather and his legacy will be honored posthumously with the Washington Medal
of Honor on May 9th. I applaud Ronda’s hard
work and join with her in honoring the memory
of Town Marshal Dolar LaPlant whose service
ensured the safety of the residents of
Eatonville, Washington.

POLICE OFFICER OF THE YEAR

HON. PETE OLSON
OF TEXAS

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

Wednesday, April 29, 2015
Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to
congratulate Officer Osiel De La Cruz for
being recognized as the Pearland Officer of
the Year by both the Texas Louisiana Gulf
District and the Exchange Club of Pearland.
Officer De La Cruz was a natural choice for
this award thanks to his hard work in the community, service to the public and heroic actions. Officer De La Cruz is a veteran of the
department and a nightshift patrol officer. His
commitment to our community is evident
through his work both on and off duty. Officer
De La Cruz made over 53 DWI and drug-related arrests this year, found a shooting victim
and apprehended five offenders, and even
managed to apprehend a robbery suspect
while he was off-duty. His list of accomplishments speaks for itself. We can all sleep better at night knowing that police officers like Officer De La Cruz are on patrol.
On behalf of the Twenty-Second Congressional District of Texas, congratulations again
to Officer Osiel De La Cruz on being honored
as the Pearland Officer of the Year. Thank
you for your dedication to keeping our communities safe.

– Each commuter rail car needs 1,000 hours of “burn-in” before revenue service
– Each operator needs approximately 160 hours of “throttle time” (operating the car)
along the alignment they’ll work on before they can operate in revenue service
– The FRA and FTA have full oversight and require significant inspections and safety
checks before operations

• April: First commuter rail cars went through clearance testing from Union
Station to DIA; first test under power along the Pena Boulevard corridor
successful and will continue as part of the testing and commissioning
• May: testing of at-grade crossings from Ulster to Chambers to begin; after
successful testing, trains will begin to run through those intersections
• About a month before scheduled revenue service begins, DTO will do a

will be met
