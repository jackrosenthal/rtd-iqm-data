BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: June 25, 2014

From:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

Board Meeting Date: July 15, 2014

Subject:

Award of “Group 25” Contracted Fixed-Route
Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into a contract for the provision of “Group
25” contracted fixed-route transit services with Veolia Transportation. This contract is for three
years for an amount not to exceed $66,874,659 with two (2) one-year options in the amount of
$24,271,326 (option year 1) and $25,140,353 (option year 2), for a total five year not-to-exceed
amount of $116,286,338. In addition, RTD will reimburse the contractor’s direct fuel costs in an
amount estimated to be approximately $13,799,677 for the initial three year contract term,
$4,816,129 for option year 1, and $4,929,152 for option year 2, for a total of $23,544,958 for the
five year period. This results in a total not-to-exceed contract amount of $80,674,336 for the initial
three year contract period and $139,831,296 for the five year period. This proposal represents the
most responsive and responsible proposal received in response to Request for Proposals (RFP) 14DH-021, to provide “Group 25” Public Transportation Services. The contract to provide this service
is scheduled to be effective on January 4, 2015.
BACKGROUND:
In support of the Board adopted strategic goal of Innovative and Fiscally Sustainable Service Delivery,
RTD privatizes a portion of its fixed route bus service.
Originally mandated by Senate Bill 88-164 revised in 1999 under HB99-1030, revised in 2003 under
HB03-1103, and revised in 2007 under SB07-251, RTD “may implement a system under which up to
fifty-eight percent (58%) of the District’s vehicular service is provided by qualified private businesses
pursuant to competitively negotiated contracts.”
In April of 2014, RTD issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) soliciting technical and price proposals to
provide contracted fixed-route transit services, referred to as “Group 25”. The Group 25 service
package represents the re-bid of service currently operated by Veolia Transportation under Contract
Group 21, and includes local and express service in the Denver metro area. The RFP was mailed to
13 firms who indicated an interest in proposing on opportunities to provide contracted fixed-route
services. Proposals were due on May 19, 2014.
The Group 25 service offering consists of 107 buses operating 29 routes providing approximately
332,000 revenue hours per year. A summary of the routes included in Group 25 is included as
Attachment A. The entire Group 25 service package is currently operated by Veolia Transportation.
Implementation of Group 25 service is scheduled to be effective January 4, 2015. The award of
“Group 25” service to Veolia Transportation as recommended, will maintain RTD’s current status of
providing approximately 57% of RTD vehicular service by private contractor.
DISCUSSION:

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

Three (3) proposals were received in response to RFP 14-DH-021 for the Provision of Group 25
Public Transportation Services. Proposals were received from First Transit, MV Transportation and
Veolia Transportation.
It is the recommendation of the evaluation committee formed to evaluate proposals received in
response to RFP 14-DH-021, that RTD award a contract for Group 25 fixed route transit service to
Veolia Transportation. Veolia Transportation was the highest ranked proposal for both the technical
response and the SBE plan/goal attainment.
The Veolia Transportation five-year cost was
$1,101,189 less than the highest bid and $232,530 higher than the lowest bid (See Group 25 Proposer Cost Summary below).
The recommendation for contract award is based upon the evaluation of the proposals according to
the evaluative criteria as set forth in the RFP for this procurement. The evaluative criteria established
for this procurement were: a) understanding/approach and organization for implementation (35%); b)
experience/qualifications and safety record (30%); c) price (30%); and d) SBE plan and goal
attainment (5%).
The technical evaluation team consisted of Mike Gil, Deputy AGM, Bus Operations; Steve Gieske,
Assistant General Superintendent, Maintenance; Alice Osner, General Superintendent,
Transportation; Carolyn Conover, Senior Manager, Contracted Services; Greg Smith, Manager,
Competitive Services; and Derrick Wojcik-Damers, Senior Technician, Contracted Services. The SBE
plan and goal attainment evaluation team consisted of Zamy Silva, Manager, SBO; and Amanda
Murray, Civil Rights Specialist.
Proposal Review – The members of the technical evaluation team individually reviewed the technical
proposals submitted by the three proposers. Each team member evaluated the proposals and
assigned a score for “Understanding and Approach” and for “Experience and Qualifications.” Based
on the average of the individual scores received in these categories, Veolia Transportation was the
highest rated technical proposal followed by MV Transportation and First Transit. The SBE team
individually reviewed the SBE plan and proposed goal attainment documents and assigned a score for
the “SBE Plan and Goal Attainment” for each proposal. This score was added to the technical
evaluation scores. Veolia was again ranked the highest in SBE goal attainment (Veolia was the only
proposer that exceeded the SBE goal). The score for the “Cost” element of each proposal was
calculated by the RTD procurement staff. The cost score was then added to the technical score and
SBE score of each proposal to determine the overall score or rating of each proposal. Veolia
Transportation had the highest overall rated proposal (89 out of 100) followed by MV Transportation
(85 out of 100) and First Transit (81 out of 100). Even though Veolia Transportation scored the
highest overall in the selection process, their cost proposal was above the RTD internal cost estimate
and as a result the selection committee elected to move forward with oral presentations.
Oral Presentations – Veolia Transportation was asked to provide further detail on previous
management team turnover and to elaborate on the components of their cost proposal. MV
Transportation and First Transit were both asked to provide further detail on their proposed facility
(coincidently both proposed the same location), their proposed management team, their SBE plan and
their recruitment plan. The proposers were asked to submit a best and final offer (BAFO). Upon
review of the revised price proposals and additional information provided it was determined that
Veolia Transportation provided the most responsive and responsible proposal for the Group 25
service followed by First Transit and then MV Transportation.

1.B.1

The final ranking represents the evaluation team’s conclusion that the strengths of the Veolia
Transportation technical and SBE proposal outweighed the strengths of the MV Transportation and
First Transit proposals and more than offset the slight difference in cost.

A key strength of the Veolia Transportation proposal was the proposed management team. Under
this team’s leadership, the Veolia division consistently meets/exceeds many of the RTD quarterly
performance goals. The team has developed and nurtured positive and productive relationships with
Denver metropolitan area governments and communities. The team is experienced in providing
service for RTD and there will be no need for startup and, consequently, no disruption of service
when transitioning from the “Group 21” contract to the new “Group 25” contract. Veolia
Transportation proposed very detailed maintenance, operations and safety/training plans; and an
increase in operator wages. They will also be adding a dedicated Customer Service Representative
to help further address customer complaints and a SBE Compliance Specialist to maintain positive
working relationships with their SBE partners. Veolia’s initial effort to identify and engage SBE
vendors has allowed Veolia to already exceed the contract SBE goal.
The strengths of the MV Transportation proposal included experience with “Maximus” maintenance
reporting software and a detailed start-up plan, but the MV Transportation proposal was determined
to be weak in the areas of facility location and plan; and the proposed management team did not
have recent/relevant experience with a transit bus property similar in scope, size, and complexity.
The strengths of the First Transit proposal included a strong management team, but the First Transit
proposal was determined to be weak in the area of their facility location and plan and their final cost
proposal was the highest of the three proposals.
Veolia Transportation provides voluntary medical, dental, vision, and life insurance for employees.
Veolia Transportation pays 85% of the cost of the premium for medical insurance (regardless of the
benefit level) and provides voluntary flexible spending and dependent care flexible spending
accounts. Veolia Transportation pays 100% of the cost for basic life insurance coverage for each
full-time employee, and provides an Employee Assistance Program at no cost. Additionally, tuition
reimbursement is available, along with options for supplemental life, spousal life, and child life
insurance.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
Veolia Transportation’s proposed first year price for “Group 25” is 8.2% lower than the current
contract price of the “Group 21” contract that it replaces. Veolia Transportation’s proposed hourly
rates for the five-year period of the proposed contract range from $64.50 (contract year 1) to
$72.75 (contract year 5). The hourly rates for RTD’s other current fixed-route contracts range from
$62.10-$65.73 (current contract year) to $62.15-$65.73 (contract year 5). The total five-year
proposed price represents a $28.5 million savings over the estimated cost for RTD to provide the
service.
In addition to the hourly costs paid to the Contractor for the provision of service, the actual diesel

Packet Pg. 5

1.B.1

fuel costs incurred by the Contractor in the provision of the specified service will be paid by the
District through the contact. RTD will reimburse the actual cost for diesel fuel to the Contractor as a
separate cost item.

The RTD internal financial analysis (Attachment B) indicates that the estimated cost for RTD to
provide these services would be higher than the prices offered by the recommended service provider.
The estimated cost of internal operation was prepared by RTD’s Finance Department and is based on
current and projected wage rates and other operating expenses based on RTD’s current experience
providing other fixed-route services. In addition to estimating the cost for RTD to provide the services
included in the Group 25 service package, the cost of providing a facility to serve as the operating
and maintenance base for the provision of the services is also included in the estimated cost of RTD
operation. This is done in order to evaluate the total cost that would be incurred by RTD to provide
the services. RTD currently does not have the capacity to provide these additional services without
building or leasing additional facilities to serve as the operating and maintenance base for the
provision of the services. The cost of providing facilities to serve as the operating and maintenance
base for Veolia Transportation’s provision of the services is included in Veolia Transportation’s Direct
Service Cost as shown in Attachment B.
Funds for the provision of the first year of service under this contract will be included in the adopted
2015 RTD budget. There are no proposed start-up costs, and therefore, there is no impact on the
2014 budget. Funds will be requested in future budgets for the provision of service in future years.
ALTERNATIVES:
1)
Award the contract to Veolia Transportation, as recommended
2)
Award the contract to the second ranked proposer (First Transit) or the third ranked
proposer (MV Transportation). This is not recommended as it does not reflect the
outcome of the evaluation team’s evaluation process and RTD’s procurement process.
3)
Resolicit the Group 25 service package. This is not recommended as the proposal
process has resulted in a responsive and responsible proposal that is less expensive
than RTD is currently paying for the provision of these services, is less expensive than
the RTD internal cost estimate (ICE) and is less expensive than the estimated cost for
RTD to provide these services internally.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: June 26, 2014

From:

William C. Van Meter,Assistant General
Manager, Planning

GM

Date:

June 20, 2014

Board Meeting Date: July 15, 2014

Subject:

RTP/Senate Bill 208 State Highway 119

Resolution
RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
approve the attached Resolution, which will permit staff to submit to DRCOG an SB 208 Report in
early 2015 which specifies the technology and the method of financing for the SH 119 Bus Rapid
Transit (BRT) project.
BACKGROUND
This action fits within the General Manager’s 2014 Goals of Innovative and fiscally sustainable
service delivery and Grow ridership and engage customers across the region as implementation of
the SH 119 BRT project will increase the service reliability, ridership and cost effectiveness of the
service.
RTD initiated the Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS), in April 2013. The purpose of the st udy
was to develop consensus among RTD, the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) and the
Northwest-area stakeholders, including local jurisdictions and businesses, on cost effective and
efficient mobility improvements to serve the Northwest area. On June 24, 2014, the Board approved
a resolution which accepted the Final Consensus Statement as developed by the NAMS stakeholders
for priorities within the Northwest Study Area. The highest consensus priority for arterial BRT, as
described in the NAMS Final Consensus Statement, was to proceed into advanced planning,
environmental clearance and preliminary engineering to establish BRT in the SH 119 Corridor from
Longmont to Boulder. Staff submitted a Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery
(TIGER) Planning Grant on April 28, 2014, to pursue these advanced planning activities. As part of
the 2040 Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) process, Boulder County, using the results of RTD’s
NAMS analyses, has submitted the SH 119 Corridor for consideration by DRCOG for inclusion in the
2040 Regional Transportation Plan (RTP). DRCOG’s RTP scoring criteria indicate that the project is
eligible for inclusion in the fiscally-constrained RTP and would be eligible for future federal funding
participation through the DRCOG Transportation Improvement Program. Inclusion of the corridor in
the RTP is required before National Environmental Planning Act (NEPA) clearance can be completed.
The cost to establish BRT in the corridor is estimated to be approximately $57 million in 2013 dollars
and $75 million in Year of Expenditure dollars (2021-2024).
DISCUSSION
SB 208 grants DRCOG the statutory authority to review and approve the technology and method of
financing for RTD fixed-guideway projects. Should RTD pursue BRT in this corridor, as prioritized by
the NAMS Final Consensus Statement, the SH 119 BRT project would be subject to SB 208
approval. Discussions with DRCOG staff have indicated that RTD should submit the SB 208 report in

Packet Pg. 12

2.B.1

early 2015. The expectation is that the funding breakdown for BRT in the corridor would be as
follows:



50 percent from RTD Base System Funds; and
50 percent from DRCOG Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) funds through the
Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement (CMAQ) funds and/or Surface
Transportation Program (STP)-Metro funds.

Based on current financial projections, project construction is expected to occur within the 2021 to
2024 timeframe. However, recognizing the effectiveness of this project and local stakeholder
support, RTD intends to pursue opportunities to accelerate project planning, environmental and
design work and to explore financing options to accelerate the project completion date. Future Board
action would be required to approve advancing BRT in this corridor.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact directly related to this action; however, should the Board at a later date, and
after further study, opt to move forward with implementation of this project, there will be a financial
impact to the District. Current DRCOG projections for the fiscally-constrained 2040 RTP indicate the
project will be eligible for federal funding support through the TIP in the 2015 -2024 timeframe as
described above. The cost of the corridor is projected to be $57 million in 2013 dollars and $75 million
in Year of Expenditure dollars (2021-2024), with the expectation that 50 percent of the project’s
funding would come from DRCOG TIP sources and 50 percent from RTD Base System Funds; and future
Board action would be required to advance implementation of this BRT corridor.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning and Development
Committee that the RTD Board of Directors approve the attached Resolution, which will
permit staff to submit to DRCOG an SB 208 Report in early 2015 which specifies the
technology and the method of financing for the SH 119 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) project.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not approve the attached resolution, which
would permit staff to submit to DRCOG, when appropriate, an SB 208 Report which specifies
the technology and the method of financing for the SH 119 BRT project.

RESOLUTION No. ____
SERIES OF 2014
APPROVAL OF SH 119 BUS RAPID TRANSIT PLANS PURSUANT TO SB
208 (C.R.S. 32-9-107.7) AND DIRECTING STAFF TO SUBMIT PROJECT FOR
CONSIDERATION TO THE DENVER REGIONAL COUNCIL OF
GOVERNMENTS
Whereas, RTD initiated the Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS), in April 2013. The
purpose of the study was to develop consensus among RTD, the Colorado Department of
Transportation (CDOT) and the Northwest-area stakeholders, including local jurisdictions and
businesses, on cost effective and efficient mobility improvements to serve the Northwest area;
Whereas, on June 24, 2014, the RTD Board approved a resolution which accepted the
Final Consensus Statement as developed by the NAMS stakeholders for priorities within the
Northwest Study Area;
Whereas, one of the highest priorities, as described in the Final Consensus Statement,
was to proceed into advanced planning, environmental clearance and preliminary engineering to
establish Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) in the SH 119 Corridor from Longmont to Boulder;
Whereas, RTD has submitted a Transportation Investment Generating Economic
Recovery (TIGER) grant to pursue advanced planning for BRT in the SH 119 Corridor;
Whereas, Boulder County, using the results of RTD’s NAMS analysis, has submitted the
SH 119 BRT corridor for consideration and inclusion in the 2040 Regional Transportation Plan
(RTP) process;
Whereas, inclusion of the corridor in the RTP is required before National Environmental
Planning Act (NEPA) clearance can be completed;
Whereas, the cost to establish BRT is estimated to be approximately $57 million in 2013
dollars and $75 million in Year of Expenditure dollars and the expectation is that,
implementation of the SH 119 BRT Corridor would occur in the 2021 to 2024 timeframe, if not
sooner;
Whereas, future Board action will be required prior to the implementation of BRT in this
corridor.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that:
The RTD Board of Directors hereby approves the plans for SH 119 Bus Rapid Transit
pursuant to SB 208 (C.R.S. 32-9-107.7) and;
