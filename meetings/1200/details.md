There were no recommended actions.

#### 1. MPACT64 Update - Mayor Jim Gunning and Herman Stockinger

Herman Stockinger, CDOT Director – Office of Policy and Intergovernmental Relations, and the Honorable Mayor Jim Gunning reviewed a Power Point presentation with the Board that is available in the August 6, 2013 Government Relations Committee Agenda Packet.

Director Lubow asked if the estimate of $200 million that transit would get is an annual amount.  Mayor Gunning stated that was correct.  It will be $200 million for 15 years.

Director Lubow commented that there has been talk about perhaps having an education money request on a ballot.  She wonders if MPACT64 worked to determine who will go first.  Mayor Gunning said that MPACT64 is targeted for 2014 while education will be in 2013.

Director Lasater asked if there has been an analysis of the economic impact in attracting or repelling new businesses coming to Colorado because of the increased sales tax; he expressed that is an issue as it stands in most municipal areas.  Director Lasater is concerned it may be a detractor.  Mayor Gunning stated there was a lot of discussion about sales tax.  He believes if you speak with any mayor they will say transportation is an economic development issue for their area; these are infrastructure benefits that will have a return that far exceeds the sales tax.

Director Sisk thanked the Metro Mayor’s Caucus for advancing this funding issue and resulting proposed sales tax increase.  He believes it is critical for every Board member to take the needed steps and lead in their area to advance this.  Director Sisk hopes that if there are Directors that do not support the tax there can be a very enlightened discussion as to why they do not support it.  He believes this is an avenue to bridge the gap on FasTracks.

Director Walker wonders if the surveys included any questions about the public’s perception of land use and the role it plays in congestion.  Mayor Gunning stated that he could not answer that specific question.  He would need to speak with the survey’s sponsors.  Mayor Gunning thinks the next poll will be more broadly available to everyone.

Director Walker asked if there is an optimal percentage of lane expansion that CDOT sees necessary to keep up with the growing population.  Herman Stockinger explained that it is really on a corridor by corridor basis.  In some cases the answer will be managed lanes while in some cases it might be traffic management.

Chair Anderson thanked Mayor Gunning and Herman Stockinger for all their efforts.  She shared that she has spent over 20 years dealing with transportation in the state as well as this region.  She believes it is a good thing to involve the whole State; if the Denver area were to do this by themselves it would devastate the rest of the State.  Mayor Gunning thanked Chair Anderson and the RTD Staff for their support.

Director Bagley thanked Mayor Gunning and Herman Stockinger for presenting to the board.  Director Bagley noted that RTD is the largest transit agency in the State of Colorado.  He believes it would be very productive for MPACT64 to have a resolution from the RTD Board to support the effort.  He is encouraging RTD to have a resolution prepared in the following weeks as it would be really beneficial for the effort.  Mayor Gunning commented that support is great and they would welcome RTD’s resolution.  He feels there is a great deal of momentum now.

Director Deadwyler thanked everyone on the MPACT64 team for their effort and Mayor Gunning and Herman Stockinger for their presentation.  She commented that the Board has been talking about going to the taxpayers to ask for a .1% sales tax increase and decided to delay that.  Director Deadwyler is concerned about the split, which would give RTD less than what we would have been asking for with the .1% increase.  She wonders if MPACT64 can look at the split and see if RTD could benefit from a little bit more.  Director Deadwyler does not want to see RTD’s projects delayed or stopped because we are not receiving even close to the .1% we would have been asking for.  Mayor Gunning expressed one of the reasons they wanted to do this presentation was to gather input.

Committee Chair Daly asked where the Governor stands on this issue.  Herman Stockinger explained that he and CDOT Director Hunt would not be attending MPACT64 meetings if the Governor did not allow that to happen.  He wants them to continue the conversation, see what kind of momentum is built, and go from there.

#### 2. Local Update - Roger Sherman

Roger Sherman stated that much of his team’s time this summer has been spent supporting the efforts of MPACT64.  He said they will work closely with RTD Staff and the Chair as this progresses.

Roger Sherman passed out a Metro-Denver Municipal Election Snapshot that is available in the August 6, 2013 Government Relations Committee Agenda Packet.  He said that as he has mentioned, his team is monitoring the local elections closely.  Roger Sherman explained that we have not passed the August deadline so they do not have a final snapshot but this is getting very close.

Director Hoy noted that for the Westminster election Mary Lindsey was not on the list and he though she had announced her candidacy.  He wonders if she announced but has not filed.  Roger Sherman stated that he has placed a call to verify the information for Westminster because he had noticed that as well.  He said there are several council people that have been talking about running but have not filed.

#### 3. State Update - Jenifer Brandeberry

Jenifer Brandeberry and Julie McKenna thanked the Board for the extension of their contract; they are very excited to be working with RTD and the Board for another year.

Jenifer Brandeberry stated that over the summer much of the conversation has been centered around MPACT64.  She said at the state level, the Transportation Committee has been meeting and, based on last year’s election, prioritized touring the various regions of the State to try to get new members educated about the various statewide needs.  Jenifer Brandeberry shared that she and Julie McKenna, along with RTD Staff, will be meeting shortly with the Transportation Committee to discuss RTD’s potential legislative needs.

Jenifer Brandeberry stated that it is important to note the two recall elections.  She said that regardless of the outcome, just the fact that Colorado has never had a recall election and now there are two is pretty unreal.  She believes it will change the tenor of the upcoming legislative session.  Jenifer Brandeberry explained that while the Democrats would still be in control, if either legislator is recalled it will be by a much narrower margin.

Director Folska said that it has been so fantastic to work with Jenifer Brandeberry and Julie McKenna.  She believes that because of their efforts it was a very successful legislative session for RTD.

Director Bagley noted that there had been some discussion about having tours of Denver Union Station and the West line during the legislative break.  He asked for an update.  Jenifer Brandeberry explained that the Max Tyler, Chairman of the House Transportation Committee, thought the priority for the summer should be the statewide tours.  She noted the DUS tours and tour of other RTD properties are dependent on what is open due to the construction schedule; however, both chairs of the transportation committees are very interested in working with RTD.

Director Lasater commented that there was just a tour of the East line.  He believes it was very informative and there was a lot to see.  He suggests that other Directors and our legislators, if interested, take the tour.  He said they would be quite amazed at what is in progress.

General Manager Washington stated that RTD would extend an invitation to the 50% completion event to all State legislators.  He also stated that we are prepared to host any visit at any time in DUS, Eagle P3 or the East line as long as they are dressed appropriately for the construction site.

Committee Chair Daly asked when the recall election is being held.  Jenifer Brandeberry said September 10th, 2013.

#### 4. Federal Update - Sherry Ellebracht

Sherry Ellebracht, Government Relations Officer, said that as the Board is probably aware, the Senate and House have gone on their summer break; they will come back September 9th and have nine days of legislative work before the new fiscal year begins on October 1st.  She explained that neither the House nor Senate passed their Transportation bills before the break so they will have nine days to come up with a bill.  She stated that the Senate was at $54 billion and the House at $44 million so they are very far apart ($10 billion).  Sherry Ellebracht reiterated that it is a very contentious congress that has a very difficult time agreeing on anything; they have not passed any of the appropriation bills.  Sherry Ellebracht said that the House Speaker has asked for a short term continuing resolution.  She explained that they will need to write it by September 30th or the Government will shut down.  Sherry Ellebracht believes they will come to an agreement for the continuing resolution since no one wants the Government to shut down.  She thinks that if there is a continuing resolution that is long-term the FTA will be given a pot of money to distribute at its discretion.  She said that Patton Boggs will work with the FTA if that happens to try to get RTD what we were promised for Eagle P3.  Patton Boggs has also been working with the appropriators on the Hill.  She shared that Congressman Perlmutter has called Secretary Fox on our behalf and Patton Boggs is working with Senator Bennett as well.  She believes it always helps when you have our Congressmen and Senators supporting RTD.

Sherry Ellebracht stated that there are a lot of major issues that need to be addressed such as funding the Highway Users Tax Fund (HUTF), the debt ceiling, etc.

Director Sisk requested that Patton Boggs reach out to Congressman Gardner in the North Metro area.  He asked for a report on Gardner’s position if they have already reached out to him.
