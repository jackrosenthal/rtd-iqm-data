Local Needs Also Adding Up:
CML & CCI Presented to the Joint Transportation Committees of the Legislature

∗ CML told the Committees that they had conducted a survey of their
members gauging the state of their local transportation systems.
According to CML, the following were their key findings (excerpted
from the Move Colorado website)
∗ 90% list streets as a budgetary challenge
∗ 53% list street maintenance/improvements #1
∗ 59% report unfunded identified street projects
∗ 24% report unfunded identified bridge projects

∗ CCI backed increasing funding for transportation with an affirmative
statement:

∗ “CCI supports efforts to generate increased transportation revenue to
address state and local transportation infrastructure needs – including a
referred ballot measure to increase transportation revenues – provided that
any new revenues generated are shared among state, county and
municipal governments in the same proportions as current HUTF
payments.” – Colorado Counties, Inc.

pointed to transit. Among the words they chose to use were,
in priority order:

Attachment: MPACT64 Presentation v-9 (1656 : Government Relations Update)

∗ Multimodal improvements
∗ System preservation & annual maintenance
∗ Safety
∗ New capacity – managed lanes

∗Revenue Strategies
∗ Statewide funding first
∗ Then address regional needs
∗ Or — both at once

Revenue Strategies Under
Discussion
∗ Motor Fuel Tax
∗ User fees — seen as necessary and appropriate by many
∗ Paid by trucking industry and tourist traffic
∗ Unpopular with voters in Colorado & nationwide
∗ Declining revenue source with fuel efficiency & alternate fuel
vehicles

∗ Extending State sales tax to fuels
∗ Sales Tax
∗ Popular with voters
∗ Relied on by local governments as a general revenue source
∗ Temporary source at best

∗ Other user fees — bicycle registration?

MPACT64 Straw Man
Potential Funding Strategy
Currently Under Consideration/Discussion
∗ Statewide Sales Tax Increase
Attachment: MPACT64 Presentation v-9 (1656 : Government Relations Update)

∗ Transportation Lockbox
∗ No access for “off the top” diversions (State Patrol, Ports of Entry, etc.)
∗ No access for legislative diversion to general fund expenditure
∗ .7% sales tax
∗ 10 to 15 year sunset
∗ Distribution between HUTF and Transit at 67% and 33%
∗ Transit distribution to transit agencies and interregional transit projects
∗ HUTF distribution 60% to State, 22% to counties, 18% to
municipalities
∗ Distribution to municipalities optional by region of the state:
∗ Rural by HUTF formulas?
∗ Metro/urban by population?

∗ State and regional project list
∗ Discussion of alternate strategies is ongoing

Possible Distribution Scenario

Distribution assuming .7% sales tax dedicated to transportation — with 33% for transit and 67% to
the HUTF

Best
Attachment: MPACT64 Presentation v-9 (1656 : Government Relations Update)

What Comes After Fuel Tax Is No Longer Viable
and Any Interim Solution Sunsets?
∗ Do we want only user taxes/fees
∗ How do we ensure everyone contributes
∗ Electric cars/natural gas/other alternates
∗ Trucking industry
∗ Tourism

∗ Should it fund transit & bike/ped needs

Ideas?

Why Now— Why Us?
∗ It is never a good time for a tax increase
∗ If not now, when?
∗ Last motor fuel tax increase 1991
∗ FASTER 2009
∗ Term limits force us to start from scratch

∗ If not us, who?
∗ State legislature?
∗ Congress?
