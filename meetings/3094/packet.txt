Ad Hoc Committee on Code of Conduct - Charter

•
•

•

•

•

RTD has an obligation to ensure the safety, cleanliness, and accessibility of the transit
system.
To this end, the agency has established a Board-approved Code of Conduct to
establish, convey, and regulate appropriate behavior on RTD vehicles, facilities, and
property.
During the Board Meeting held in April 21, 2020, the RTD Board approved revisions
to the Code of Conduct that were brought by staff largely to address safety concerns
and complications that have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 public health crisis.
The ad hoc committee (committee) was created for the purpose of reviewing the
impact of the revisions to the RTD Code of Conduct to ensure that the Code:
o Continues to work toward preserving the safety, cleanliness, and accessibility
of RTD’s transit system for all our patrons;
o Is enforced fairly, consistently, and equitably; and
o Addresses the current public safety needs of employees and passengers using
the system during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Additionally, the committee meetings will serve as a collaborative venue in which to
discuss with committee participants how the Code of Conduct supports RTD’s
mission of safe, clean transportation.

Authorization:
•

Section 32-9-109.5 and Section 32-9-114 of the RTD Act describe the administrative
powers and authority given to the RTD Board of Directors. The Board Bylaws provide
further description of standing committees. The standing committee can take a vote
on an action to move it forward to the full Board at a regular Board meeting, but the
action is not an official action of the District unless approved by the Board at a formal
Board meeting or Special Board Meeting.

Committee Composition:
•
•

The current Chair of the Board is Angie Rivera-Malpiede. The Chair of the Board
shall serve as Committee Chair.
Chair Rivera-Malpiede appointed the following committee members from RTD:
o Directors Lewis, Mihalik, Whitmore, and Williams
o General Manager Paul J. Ballard
o Michael Ford, Chief Operations Officer
o Mike Meader, Chief Safety Officer and AGM of Safety, Security, & Asset

4. The ADA and Reasonable Modification:
Under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), transportation entities are required to make reasonable
modifications to their policies, practices, and procedures to avoid discrimination and ensure that their
programs are accessible to individuals with disabilities. In accordance with this directive, RTD will make
every effort, to the maximum extent feasible, to ensure that a person with a disability has access to,
and benefits from, its services. RTD will make reasonable modifications to its policies, programs, and
procedures applicable to its transportation services when necessary to avoid discrimination and ensure
accessibility for people with disabilities. There may be certain situations when RTD’s policies and
procedures do not achieve ADA objectives/accessibility. A modification to these policies and procedures
may be needed to ensure that a passenger with a disability has access our services. Examples of
reasonable modification can be found on RTD’s website under the Accessibility section. When making
a reasonable modification for an individual with a disability, the modification is not intended to:
•Cause a direct threat to the health and safety of others
•Create undue financial and administrative burdens
•Constitute a fundamental alteration to a service
•Be more than necessary to provide equal access to an RTD service
Any questions or concerns on reasonable modification should be directed to RTD’s Division of Civil
Rights, ADA Managers Office: 303-299-2221.
5. Enforcement:
RTD will comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act
in the administration of this Code of Conduct.
If violations of this Code of Conduct appear or are claimed to be caused by a disability, RTD
personnel are to contact Dispatch or Security for advice and assistance.
A person who engages in any of the above prohibited conduct may be warned and/or ordered to
immediately exit the RTD vehicle, facility, or property by an RTD Transit Police Officer, an RTD Transit

Other Prohibited or Illegal Activity

1.F.1.c

Situations where a person refuses to leave an RTD vehicle, facility, or property after being ordered to
do so may be considered trespassing and may be referred to law enforcement personnel.
A person who engages in any of the above prohibited conduct may also, or instead, be issued a
suspension by RTD, suspending the person from all RTD vehicles, properties, and services for a
determined amount of time pursuant to RTD’s Service Suspension policy and procedures.
A person ordered to leave or suspended from RTD property will not be entitled to any refund of unused
fare media that may expire during the time of the person’s exclusion.
Suspension or orders to exit RTD property may be appealed pursuant to RTD’s Service Suspension
policy and procedures.
In addition to any other enforcement under this Code, riding an RTD vehicle without evidence that the
proper fare has been paid may be treated in accordance with Colorado Traffic Code, C.R.S. § 42-41416.
In addition to any other enforcement under this Code, illegal activity may result in a citation under any
applicable federal, state, or local law, regulation, or ordinance, including C.R.S. § 18-9-114 - Hindering
Transportation (Class 2 Misdemeanor), and C.R.S. § 18-9-115 - Endangering Public Transportation and
Utility Transmission (Class 3 Felony).
This Code of Conduct does not seek to limit, replace, or conflict with any federal, state, or
local law, regulation, or ordinance and does not limit or prevent any law enforcement
agency or entity from taking any lawful action against any person on any RTD vehicle,
facility, or property.

4. The ADA and Reasonable Modification:
Under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) transportation entities are required to make reasonable
modifications to their policies, practices and procedures to avoid discrimination and ensure that their
programs are accessible to individuals with disabilities. In accordance with this directive RTD will make
every effort, to the maximum extent feasible, to ensure that a person with a disability has access to,
and benefits from, its services. RTD will make reasonable modifications to its policies, programs, and
procedures applicable to its transportation services, when necessary to avoid discrimination and ensure
accessibility for people with disabilities. There may be certain situations when RTD’s policies and
procedures do not achieve ADA objectives/accessibility. A modification to these policies and procedures
may be needed to ensure that a passenger with a disability has access our services. Examples of
reasonable modification can be found on RTD’s website under the Accessibility section. When making
a reasonable modification for an individual with a disability, the modification is not intended to:
•Cause a direct threat to the health and safety of others
• Create undue financial and administrative burdens
