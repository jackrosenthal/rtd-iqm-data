BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

Date: February 5, 2019

From:

Fred Worthen, Assistant General Manager of
Bus Operations

GM

Date:

February 5, 2019

Board Meeting Date: February 26, 2019

Subject:

Award of “Group 28” Contracted Fixed-Route
Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into a contract with First Transit for the
provision of contracted fixed-route transit services “Group 28.” This contract is for three years, with
two one-year options for a total of 5-years. The initial 3-year contract amount for service is
$81,174,070.00; the option year 1 amount is $29,386,941.00; and the option year 2 amount is
$30,671,864.00. The total 5-year not-to-exceed amount for service is $141,232,875.00. In
addition, RTD will reimburse the contractor’s direct fuel costs in an amount estimated to be
$10,200,929.00 for the initial 3-year contract term; $3,547,094.00 for option year 1; and
$3,618,757.00 for option year 2.
The total 5-year not-to-exceed amount for fuel is
$17,366,779.00. The total 5-year not-to-exceed amount for the contracted fixed route transit
service and fuel is $158,599,654.00.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services
Task Goal #3 – Ensure Fiscal Sustainability
BACKGROUND
Originally mandated in 1988 by Senate Bill 88-164 and revised by other legislative activities over the
years, RTD is obligated to “implement a system under which up to fifty-eight percent of the district’s
vehicular service is provided by qualified private businesses pursuant to competitively negotiated
contracts.” RTD currently outsources approximately 45% of its fixed-route service, 100% of its
ADA paratransit service (Access-a-Ride), and 100% of its general public on-demand service (Flex
Ride, formerly known as Call-n-Ride). The total amount of vehicular service currently contracted out
is close to 56%.
On October 2, 2018, a Request for Proposals (RFP) 18-DH-039 named “Group 28” was issued
soliciting proposals for the provision of fixed-route transit services. The “Group 28” service package
replaces “Group 24”, which will expire in 2019. The service package consists of 118 buses
operating 38 routes providing approximately 329,437 revenue hours per year. A summary of the
routes included in “Group 28” is included as Attachment A. Responses to the Request for Proposals
were due on November 2, 2018. Proposers were required to provide detailed operating plans for
providing fixed-route service, including hiring and training employees, maintaining RTD-provided
transit vehicles, and conforming to RTD operating requirements. The contract award was anticipated
to be awarded on a fixed-price basis and based on “best value” competitive proposal procedures.

1.B.1

DISCUSSION
This recommendation represents the most responsive and responsible proposal received in response
to Request for Proposals (RFP) 18-DH-039 to provide “Group 28” Public Transportation Services. The
contract to provide this service is scheduled to be effective on August 25, 2019.
PROCUREMENT
One (1) proposal was received from First Transit in response to RFP 18-DH-039 for the Provision of
“Group 28” Public Transportation Services. Five additional companies expressed interest in the
solicitation, however, these firms elected not to submit proposals primarily due to the following
reasons:
All Aboard America Holding - After reviewing the work scope, All Aboard America Holding
determined this type of service required resources they are currently lacking.
Keolis Transit Services – Keolis Transit Services found the 30 day turnaround on the RFP timeline to
be too limiting.
National Express - The difficulty of finding an appropriate facility to locate their operations was too
great an obstacle for National Express to prepare a competitive proposal.
RATP Dev USA – RATP Dev USA indicated that finding a facility in the Denver market is nearly
impossible. The incumbent has a definite advantage so they chose not to bid.
Transdev – Transdev had already committed to other existing clients for proposals for work that
were at the RFP stage, so Transdev chose to pass on bidding on the “Group 28” services.
In response to the input received from the Prospective bidders, RTD staff has made the following
changes to the fixed route bus operation RFP process.
1. All Fixed Route bus service procurements will be placed on the upcoming RFP announcement
page six (6) months in advance of the RFP being released.
2. RFPs for fixed route bus service packages will be advertised for 60 days instead of 30 days.
The First Transit proposal was evaluated on the following evaluative criteria:
a)
understanding/approach and organization for implementation (35%); b) experience/qualifications and
safety record (30%); c) price (30%); and d) SBE plan and goal attainment (5%).
The technical evaluation team reviewed and scored the proposal based on a) understanding/approach
and organization for implementation and b) experience/qualifications and safety record. The technical
evaluation team consisted of Carolyn Conover, Senior Manager, Contracted Services; Greg Smith,
Manager, Competitive Services; Steve Gieske, General Superintendent, Maintenance; Tim Lucero,
General Superintendent, Street Operations; Loradeane Clinkenbeard, Manager, Bus Operator Training;
and Crystal Kirklin, Technician, Contracted Services.
The SBE plan and goal attainment was reviewed and scored by Brittany Eroen, Compliance Officer,
SBO.
The proposal pricing was reviewed and scored the Procurement Department staff.

Packet Pg. 4

1.B.1

The following is a summary of the strong points of the First Transit “Group 28” proposal which
support the recommendation of contract award:
Bus Operator Wages. First Transit’s proposal provides an increase in bus operator wages. The bus
operator starting wage increased from $18.50/hour to $19.00/hour (RTD starting wage for operators
effective March 1, 2019 is $19.98/hour). Adjustments were also proposed for other operator wage
levels. RTD, as well as our contractors, have faced long-term challenges with recruiting and
retaining qualified operators. The proposed wage increases will provide First Transit the opportunity
to offer a more attractive wage package which will improve recruitment and retention of operators
and result in improved service for our passengers.
Mechanic Wages. First Transit’s C level mechanic wage is currently $21.00/hour (RTD starting
wage for the equivalent of a C level mechanic is $25.32 effective March 1, 2019). First Transit
anticipates reviewing mechanic wages during 2019 to respond to changing market conditions.
Dedicated On-site Recruiter. This new full-time position will be solely focused on the recruitment of
bus operators and maintenance personnel for the First Transit Commerce City location.
Enhanced Quality Control. First Transit will assign a corporate team to work with the local
management team to identify causes and potential modifications to improve on-time performance and
other performance metrics.
Maintenance Program. First Transit will add one additional Shop Supervisor to assist in oversight of
daily maintenance activities. Mechanics will be required to complete 40 hours of initial training and
40 hours of skills enhancement training annually. In addition, the maintenance department is certified
as both an Automotive Service Excellence (ASE) and Silver Lean shop. The Commerce City division
has 17 mechanics that are ASE certified and 6 mechanics that are Master Technician certified.
Proposed Management Team. Under this team’s leadership, the First Transit Commerce City division
consistently meets/exceeds most of the RTD quarterly performance goals. The team has developed
and nurtured positive and productive relationships with Commerce City and surrounding governments
and communities. The team has long-term experience providing service for RTD and there will be no
disruption of service when transitioning from the previous “Group 24” contract to the new “Group
28” contract.

Preventable Vehicle Accidents per 100,000 Miles: First Transit utilizes bus operator monitoring
technology and post-accident investigations for retraining of operators. They emphasize safety with
all employees at monthly safety meetings, through periodic campaigns, and with daily reminders at
their facilities.
Passenger Accident Ratio per 100,000 Miles: First Transit raises awareness of passenger safety
through campaigns and safety meetings to reduce the number of passenger accidents per 100,000
miles.

Packet Pg. 6

1.B.1

On-Time Preventive Maintenance Inspections: First Transit places a high emphasis on completing
preventive maintenance inspections as required, and as such, the local operation is diligent about
completing these inspections on time.
On-Time Performance: First Transit continues to understand the impact new operators, construction
detours, and traffic can have on OTP. From the beginning of the “Group 24” contract, First Transit
worked in conjunction with RTD Service Planning and Scheduling to improve OTP. They continue to
work on this by identifying low performing routes and assigning street supervisors to campaign the
routes and to meet with operators to discuss factors that impact their ability to run on time.
Schedule issues are forwarded to RTD Service Planning and Scheduling for review.
Miles Between Lost Service Road Calls: First Transit continually exceeds the goal in this area by
completing preventive maintenance inspections on time, working off defects in a timely manner,
monitoring repeat issues, providing additional training for mechanics, and taking a pro-active
approach to maintaining the buses in their fleet.
Operator Complaints per Boarding: First Transit’s performance in this category reflects the difficulties
experienced throughout the RTD district in the recent past due to operator shortages which resulted
in a high number of “bus late” and “bus did not show” complaints. First Transit continues to
investigate and address customer complaints with operators and take other remedial actions to
reduce the number of customer complaints.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
RTD Competitive Services Internal Cost Estimate:
This estimate was prepared by the Competitive Services Department to anticipate the amount RTD
could expect to pay to outsource the “Group 28” service package to a contract operator. Due to the
recent increase in bus operator wages by RTD and its contractors, RTD anticipated proposers would
also similarly address labor challenges by increasing other wages. RTD also factored a 3% increase
in costs for inflation. First Transit’s proposed price below is based upon a negotiated best and final
offer.
RTD Competitive Services total five-year estimate for the “Group 28” service package was
$142,954,280. First Transit’s proposed total five-year price was $141,232,875 or $1,721,405 less
than the RTD estimate. First Transit’s proposed price includes increases in inflation, training costs,
wages, and increases in maintenance costs associated with the aging 2005-2007 Gillig bus fleet.
Note: Bus Operator starting wages will increase from $18.50/hour to $19.00/hour. C level Mechanic
starting wages are currently $21.00/hour. (First Transit anticipates a review of C level Mechanic
wages to respond to changing market conditions)

provider.
The RTD internal financial analysis (Attachment B) indicates that the five-year estimated cost for RTD
to provide these services would be $156,698,258, which is $15,465,383 higher than the five-year
cost proposed by First Transit. The RTD Cost Model Estimate is based on current and projected
wage rates and other operating expenses based on RTD’s current experience providing other fixedroute services. In addition to estimating the cost for RTD to provide the services included in the
“Group 28” service package, the cost of providing a facility to serve as the operating and
maintenance base for the provision of the services is also included in the estimated cost of RTD
operation. RTD currently does not have the capacity to provide these additional services without
building or leasing additional facilities to serve as the operating and maintenance base for the
provision of the services.
The First Transit total five-year proposed price represents a $15,465,383 (10%) savings over the
estimated cost for RTD to provide the service. Please see the “Group 28” - Proposer Service Cost

RTD will require the Contractor to contract with RTD’s fuel supplier in order to purchase diesel fuel at

ALTERNATIVES
1)
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into a contract with First
Transit for the provision of contracted fixed-route transit services “Group 28.” This contract is
for three years, with two one-year options for a total of 5-years. The initial 3-year contract
amount is $81,174,070.00; the option year 1 amount is $29,386,941.00; and the option year 2
amount is $30,671,864.00. The total 5-year not-to-exceed amount for service is
$141,232,875.00. In addition, RTD will reimburse the contractor’s direct fuel costs in an
amount estimated to be $10,200,929.00 for the initial 3-year contract term; $3,547,094.00 for
option year 1; and $3,618,757.00 for option year 2. The total 5-year not-to-exceed amount for
fuel is $17,366,779.00. The total 5-year not-to-exceed amount for the contracted fixed route
transit service and fuel is $158,599,654.00.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services
Task Goal #3 – Ensure Fiscal Sustainability
2)

Resolicit the “Group 28” service package. This is not recommended as the proposal process has
resulted in a responsive and responsible proposal that is less expensive than the RTD internal cost
estimate and is less expensive than the estimated cost for RTD to provide these services
internally.

Service Availability – January 2019

RTD fixed-route bus operations provided slightly over 99.65% of all scheduled hours of bus
service in January 2019. Lost service hours for personnel-related reasons reflect a significant
decrease compared the same month (January) last year. Service delivery has improved
significantly since June 2018. Lost service for personnel related reasons follows:





January 2019 – 124.19 hours
January 2018 – 664.04 hours
Year to date hours for 2019 – 124.19 hours
Year to date hours 2018 –664.04 hours

While RTD did provide in excess of 99.65% of all scheduled hours of service in the month, it
was necessary to cover 2,939 shifts with operators working a 6th day (one of their scheduled
days off). This represents approximately 23,512 hours of service being provided by a “6th
day” RTD operator and does not include the mandated service hours provided by our
contractor partners, First Transit and TransDev.
Additional information regarding bus operator headcount follows:

Contributing to our service/staffing challenges in January were a few large special events
(Women’s March and MLK Marade) and two significant weather/snow events. Staff continues
to collaborate with our partners to address and implement measures to attract, retain and
sustain skilled employees.

Service Performance 2017
Networked Family of Services

RTD’s Mission is: "To meet our constituents' present and future public transit needs by offering safe, clean,
reliable, courteous, accessible and cost-effective service throughout the district." Service development and
performance analysis require that we ask several questions. What are the markets or demand? Should service
be provided and how much? What type of service should be provided? RTD’s general approach is as follows.
Develop a family of services suited to a variety of markets. Connect all the services together in a network to
accommodate today’s dispersed travel patterns. Match the level-of-service with demand, thus improving
performance and sustainability.

RTD service standards are depicted in the charts to help
make judgments about performance. Each rectangle
labeled by service type represents the domain for routes
that meet or exceed the 10% minimum/maximum
performance requirements for that service class. So this
is a case where it’s bad to be “outside the box.”

Subsidy per Boarding or Effectiveness

Performance is a term often used interchangeably with effectiveness and efficiency. The effectivenessproductivity charts in this report present these measures for all RTD services. Effectiveness measures
attainment of the objective—maximize ridership within
the budget—and is presented on the y-axis as subsidy per
Effectiveness - Productivity Chart
boarding. Efficiency—productivity or output/input—is
Lower
presented on the x-axis as boardings/vehicle hour. The
Same boardings,
charts offer a convenient, comparative analysis of all
less subsidy
classes of services, illustrating both absolute and relative
performance.
Better

Same subsidy,
more boardings

Boardings per Vehicle Hour or Productivity

Higher

Routes that perform minimally get minimum service frequency, typically every 30 minutes during peak periods
and 60 minutes off-peak. The charts also depict guidelines for routes where ridership significantly exceeds the
minimum, and passenger loads justify more frequent service. The orange, dotted, vertical line at 25 boardings
per hour represents the typical minimum productivity for a route to justify 15-minute frequency, and the green
line at 40 boardings per hour for 10-minute frequency.
Please note that these are true apples-to-apples comparisons of performance: all fare revenues, boardings and
costs—both operating and amortized capital—are included. For complete, detailed information see RTD’s
Transit Service Policies & Standards (under Reports).
NOTE
For 2017 the new fare revenue allocation model was implemented that better reflects ridership among our fare
zones and rider transfer rates among our classes of service. Also all bus and rail ridership boardings are now
obtained from our automatic passenger counters (APCs) rather than some derived from farebox data. This more
accurate method will cause some minor changes in performance for bus routes relative to years earlier—about
8% higher in general than before. Also, Special Services data were not broken out in 2017.

Overview

1.C.2.a

Definitions
 Boardings: Unlinked passenger trips; includes transfers as boardings.
 Vehicle (Train) Hours: In-service vehicle hours, not including dead head garage time or layover/recovery.
 Fare Revenues: The revenue allocation model allocates revenue to each route based on their: category - Local
bus, FlexRide, Regional bus, Bus Rapid Transit (BRT – Flatiron Flyer), SkyRide, Light Rail (LRT) and Commuter
Rail (CR); and ridership fare equivalent for Regional and Airport fare zones which is based on cash fares and
average boardings per trip.
 Costs: All operating, maintenance and administrative costs for providing current service, plus depreciation on
all RTD assets. Excludes interest and any costs attributed to future projects. RTD’s cost allocation model
allocates costs to each route based on its miles, hours, and peak vehicles; accounting line items are assigned
to the most relevant variable.
 Subsidy: Costs minus Fare Revenues.
Standards
RTD has established guidelines in its Transit Service Policies & Standards that the least productive 10% of routes
based on either subsidy per boarding or boardings per hour need to be evaluated for marketing, revision or
elimination, or if both measures fall below 25% for a route. The performance charts illustrate the acceptable
performance domain containing all routes meeting the 10% minimum/maximum for each class of service. The
calculation of the 10% and 25% standards are made from the annual, un-weighted data, assuming the data have
a normal distribution and using the appropriate formulas for standard deviation and confidence intervals;
however, the standard deviation is applied to the weighted average. The following table gives the current year
weighted averages and standards by class of service.

Notes on Routes Outside Their Acceptable Performance Domain
The following provides the status of these routes as of January, 2019 listed in route number order.

Route 3L East Alameda Limited - This service performs well above the 25% standard for ridership. However, the
subsidy performance falls below the 10% standard as a result of its peak only operation. Two pm peak trips were
consolidated in 2018 to increase cost effectiveness.
Route 9 West 10th Ave – Restructured April 2013 with the West Corridor opening. Current ridership productivity
slipped below standard this year and this route will be monitored for further action.
Route 28 28th Avenue - Proposed for major service reduction east of CBD in the University of Colorado A Line
Bus and Rail Operations Plan (2016), this CBD Local service currently performs above the 10% ridership standard.
We will continue to monitor the performance of this service.
Route 31L North Federal Limited - This service performs well above the 25% standard for ridership, but falls
short of the subsidy standard. This route will be discontinued with the implementation of the G Line bus and rail
service plan.
Route 32 32nd Ave/City Park – Current ridership and subsidy are below standards. Duplication with the Route
40 on Colorado Blvd was eliminated in April 2016. With the move of the VA Hospital, this service continues to
perform below standards.
Route 33 Platte Valley — This service was restructured from the Route 34 in August 2015 in hopes of gaining
ridership with a new routing. Proposed for discontinuance May 2019.
Route 39 L North Colorado Limited – Route exceeds the 25% ridership standard, but falls below the 10% subsidy
standards. This route is planned to be restructured in the North Metro Bus and Rail service plan.
Route 45 Montbello/Green Valley Ranch - Newly restructured in April 2016, this service currently performs just
below the 25% boardings per hour standard (21.4 brd/hr.). Service was reduced from 15 minutes to 30 minutes
in the Green Valley Ranch neighborhood in 2018. We will continue to monitor its ridership performance.
Route 46 South Dahlia Street – Below the 10% standard in both ridership and subsidy, this service was reduced
in 2017 and truncated in 2018 to increase productivity.
Route 62 Commerce City/Dick’s SG Park – Funded through a grant sponsored by the City of Commerce City,
ridership has been low since it began in 2017. The CMAQ grant will expire at the end of 2019.
Route 67 Ridge Road – This service underperforms in both ridership and subsidy categories. It was
recommended for discontinuance in 2012, but it was retained due to the absence of alternative services in the
SW Jeffco area.

Route 1 1st Avenue - This service falls below the 10% standard, with poor ridership performance on the eastern
segment. A major restructure is being considered for a future proposal.

1.C.2.a

Regional Transportation District

Route 55 L Olde Towne Arvada Limited - The route currently meets the ridership standard, though it is outside
of the subsidy per boarding standard. The route will be replaced in the implementation of the G Line bus and
rail service plan.

Route 80L West 80th Limited – Under performing in both ridership and subsidy categories, this route will be
merged with Route 80 in the G – Line bus and rail service Plan.
Route 85 Chatfield Avenue — Formerly a part of the Route 401, the Route 85 was created in August 2015 to
provide clarity as to where buses are traveling and allow better monitoring of the route. This route was
discontinued in August 2018.
Route 87L South Wadsworth Limited - The route currently exceeds the 10% boardings per hour standard, though
it is outside the subsidy per boarding standard. We will continue to monitor its performance for further action.
Route 89 Stapleton/Anschutz Campus – This route was started January 2013 to serve new transitional housing
and in anticipation of the opening of the East Corridor rail services in 2016. In 2014 service was reduced by half
due to poor performance and ridership fell precipitously. This service was discontinued in January 2018.
Route 100L South Kipling Ltd — This service meets the ridership standard, but falls short of the subsidy per
boarding standard. We will continue to monitor its performance for further action. Service is restructured in the
G Line bus and rail plan.
Route 112 West 112th Avenue – Currently this route exceeds the 10% boarding per hour standard, but falls short
of the 10% standard for subsidy per boarding. Route restructure in May 2018 made to improve the efficiency of
the route.
Route 128 Broomfield/Wagon Road - Route falls short on both subsidy and boardings standards. Route
restructure occurred in May 2018 to improve overall efficiency.
Route 116X South Simms – The ridership on this service has performed below the standard since the
introduction of the W Line light rail service.
Route 145X Brighton/Denver Airport - This service continues to fall below ridership and subsidy standards. We
will continue to monitor its performance.
Route 131Iliff – Current boardings per hour on this service are higher than the 10% minimal standard (17.8),
though well below the 10% standard of 23 boardings per hour. Will be monitored.
Route 139 Quincy – Current boardings per hour performance is up from 2017 and just below the 10% standard.
Route 157 CCA/Buckley — This route was newly implemented in April 2016, formed from former segments of
Routes 10, 130 and 169. A service reduction was made in August 2018 to improve productivity.

Route 72L Quaker St via Ward Ltd — The route currently meets the ridership standard, though it is outside of
the subsidy per boarding standard. The route will be replaced in the implementation of the G Line bus and rail
service plan.

1.C.2.a

Regional Transportation District

Route 169L Buckley/Tower DIA Limited – Due to the length of this service and surrounding land use, it falls short
of both the ridership and subsidy standards. The route was truncated at Smoky Hill/Pheasant Run in 2018 in an
effort to increase productivity.

Route 228 Louisville/Broomfield – January 2019, route was extended to serve the Kestrel Development, which
should increase ridership.
Route 236 Boulder Junction/US 36 & Table Mesa - New service introduced in January 2017. Current ridership
remains low and is being considered for restructure.
Route 403 Lucent Blvd — Service realigned and retimed for January 2014 and performance improved somewhat.
It remains below subsidy and productivity standards and will continue to be monitored.
Route 483 — This service was implemented in April 2016 with the University of Colorado A Line bus and rail
service plan. The route is a combination of a segment formerly on the Route 153 in Southeast Arapahoe and the
Route 410 in Parker. Will be monitored.
Route CV Pine Junction/Conifer/Denver – This route is slightly below subsidy standard, but above ridership
standard. Major service re-structure occurred in August 2018.
Route EV Evergreen/Aspen Park/Denver – This route is just below subsidy and just above ridership standards
and will be monitored. Major service re-structure occurred in August 2018.
Route J Longmont/Gunbarrel Boulder — This route is just below subsidy standard. We will continue to monitor
before taking further action.
Route R/RC/RX Brighton/Denver —Service was added in January 2011 and ridership has increased modestly,
but it still does not meet service standards. Two midday trips were discontinued January 2019, due to low
ridership.
Broomfield FlexRide - A second vehicle was added under a grant to expand the service area and while ridership
increased from 55 to 71 per day productivity dropped from 2.9 to 2.6, as customarily happens. Extensive
marketing by the City and County in partnership with the RTD is taking place in 2018 and 2019. The grant expires
in August 2019 and service will be reevaluated.
Lone Tree FlexRide — Both ridership and productivity improved slightly from 2016. However, the City has their
own Lone Tree Link service since 2015 which competes for ridership between the Lincoln rail station and several
large employers. Services will be reevaluated with the opening of SERE in 2019, when the Link will be
discontinued. The Lone Tree FlexRide continues to be marketed.
Louisville FlexRide — RTD is working with City on marketing service and adding a shopping trip to help ridership.
S Jeffco FlexRide — A change to service configuration in 2018 has produced an increase in ridership.
