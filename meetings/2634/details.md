## II. October Board Meeting Agenda Review

Chair Hoy discussed the draft October Board meeting agenda. He said the winners of RTD the bus, rail, and snowplow competitions would be announced and that 40 certificates would be handed out during the Board meeting.

Barbara McManus, Executive Manager of the Board Office, said that only the first place winners would be acknowledged for the bus competition while the first, second, and third-place winners would be announced for the for the snowplow and light rail competitions.

Chair Hoy asked whether all the winners would attend, and General Manager Genova said probably not. Chair Hoy asked if the winners would be announced all at once.

General Manager Genova said that the bus competition winners would be announced first, then light rail and snowplow winners.

Chair Hoy said a photo would be taken with each group.

Director Deadwyler asked if retirees would be in attendance.

Chair Hoy said two retirees were listed on the agenda. He asked whether the General Manager’s Oversight and Performance Management Committee would have an update, and Director Francone confirmed she would.

Director Deadwyler asked how many individuals were anticipated for the public participation segment.

Director Francone said that she had received several emails from concerned individuals.

General Manager Genova asked whether the emails addressed any particular service, and Director Francone said they were concerned with the R Line. General Manager Genova said that he spoke with the mayors of the cities along the R Line. He said that Mayor Hogan stated he was not excited about the prospect of the amended service changes but could live with them. He said that the other mayors gave more positive feedback. He stated that he had spoken to the mayor and staff from Golden and was working with them to get word out as fast as possible on what committee approved the previous Tuesday night.

Director Menten suspected that a few constituents and two to three elected officials from her district would attend. She noted that she voted against the service change action item because she stood with the original proposal.

General Manager Genova said he did not anticipate an overwhelming number of participants.

Ms. McManus said that she had received a number of phone calls about the service changes and that she had asked the callers if they planned on attending. She said that most of them were satisfied with the answers she provided and did not anticipate many of them coming.

Chair Hoy stated that the agency did solve some of the controversy. He said he would go on record that the agency was not done reviewing the schedule. He quoted Bruce Abel, Chief Operating Officer and Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, by saying that the RTD’s job was to move people, not vehicles.

Director Walker said that service changes take place every four months and that certain runs were considered for elimination each time. He said that all services were up for review.

Director Francone said she had conversations with Aurora’s City Council and Mayor Hogan. She said that Mayor Hogan complained that RTD had not done marketing in anticipation of the opening of the R Line and that business were being constructed along that corridor that are not yet finished yet. She said that the recommendation from RTD staff was to reduce service, which would not be a permanent change. She said the agency could increase the service when ridership increased. She said that Mayor Hogan’s responsibility was to be a good partner with RTD to explain to businesses and residents that the changes were not permanent. With respect to marketing and ridership, she stated she had received calls from people saying that RTD was running empty trains. She said she hoped that Mayor Hogan received similar calls and needed to help explain the situation rather than placing blame on RTD. She reported that she would be a no vote on the service changes because she liked the recommendation from staff and that she appreciated Golden’s efforts to help fund enhanced service.

Chair Hoy said that Golden was different in that they reached into their own pocketbook. He said the city had worked hard to establish a flex route.

Director Deadwyler said that she had never seen an empty train and had seen areas, as the General Manager pointed out, with low ridership, particularly in the area south of the Florida Station. She said some trains had standing room only. She agreed that something needed to be done. She stated that some constituents have said that RTD’s schedule did not meet their needs but questioned how that could be if the service ran at 15 minute intervals. She noted that her own children and grandchildren used the R Line to get to school and work and that they were satisfied that the service reductions in the amended service change proposal were limited to the weekends.

Chair Hoy said the Board needed to ensure that staff kept them apprised of ridership in order to avoid surprises.

General Manager Genova said that the monthly financial report would show information on per-line ridership on a monthly basis going forward.

Chair Hoy said that report might be enough.

Director Menten said it was important that ridership information was added back into the report.

Chair Hoy said that stop-by-stop analysis was not necessary and that, in order to anticipate problems, the agency needed to know whether ridership goes up or down.

Director Deadwyler said the whole route was being penalized because of a couple of stops.

General Manager Genova said that staff could report changes to the Board in between the service changes.

Chair Hoy said he received numerous emails about the R Line. He stated that most came from people asking for the service not to be cut but others were from people thanking RTD for reducing service.

Director Deadwyler said that she received over 300 emails and that none of them were in thanks for reducing service.

Director Menten said that people attending the Board Meeting may speak to the North Line.

Chair Hoy said that he had been approached by many people about the status of the North Line. He said he had seen in the news recently that RTD is 18 months late in constructing the line, though he noted that the Board announced the delay six months prior.

General Manager Genova said he had been contacted by stakeholders about the N Line provisions contained in the Annual Program Evaluation (APE). He said that people are concerned that staff had already considered reducing service on the R Line even before its opening. He said that would not happen. He said others are concerned with the State Highway 119 bus rapid transit project.

Chair Hoy said that two people at most may speak at the Board Meeting about the North Line. He noted the agenda contained several recommended actions and unanimous consent items.

Director Francone said she would abstain on item E on the unanimous consent agenda.

Ms. McManus said that an abstention would be a no vote.

Chair Hoy asked whether Director Francone wanted to pull item E off of the unanimous consent agenda.

Director Deadwyler said she did not understand one of the items on the agenda regarding contracts.

General Manager Genova said that the action was recommended to allow staff to budget by contract rather than having to do administrative transfers.

Director Deadwyler said she thought that the contract with All Aboard Transit was going away.

General Manager Genova said that the item was a budget transfer to pay obligations on existing contracts.

Chair Hoy reiterated that the agency still owed money to All Aboard Transit. He said that, in the future, the budget for Access-a-Ride should be a line item rather than budgeting for a specific vendor.

Director Francone said she would abstain from voting because a family member worked for Via Mobility Services. She said she did not disagree with the recommended action.

Chair Hoy restated that Director Francone was asking for item E to be pulled out of the unanimous consent agenda.

Director Francone said she could abstain from voting on the entire consent agenda.

Chair Hoy said that she did not need to abstain from the entire agenda and asked whether she would be a yes vote if item E were not included.

Ms. McManus suggested that item E be pulled from the unanimous consent agenda.

Chair Hoy asked whether the item could be pulled during the Executive Committee. The committee agreed by unanimous consent, and Ms. McManus said that the item would be a recommended action, item J, going forward

Chair Hoy said that there would be five recommended actions. He felt the Board had a great last committee meeting on Tuesday, especially for being so long, and said that the Directors asked good questions and were involved. He said the chairs of the committees did their jobs well.

General Manager Genova said that staff had attempted to shorten the agenda but most of the items were necessary.

Director Deadwyler said that the Board had considering having fewer meetings, but when the agendas are overly long, the meetings should be split up.

Chair Hoy stated that other Directors have stated their preference for having a few longer meetings instead of having short ones more often. He asked the General Manager to address the upcoming executive session.

General Manager Genova said that staff would try to keep the executive session as brief as possible. He said the session would be update to the Board on legal claims from Denver Transit Partners (DTP) and Regional Rail Partners (RRP). He said that, during the last executive session, Rolf Asphaug, General Counsel, presented a comprehensive briefing on DTP’s claim and RTD’s position on it, and staff asked for direction from the Board. He said the update on that item should take five minutes to explain DTP’s standing and RTD’s and to seek additional direction from the Board. As for the RRP claim, he said staff would update the Board as briefly as possible on the next step in the claims process.

Chair Hoy said that it was the General Manager’s intent to keep the Board as updated as necessary.

Director Deadwyler asked whether new information would be presented.

General Manager Genova said that staff would share the proposals from DTP and RRP and staff’s proposed responses. He said the Board would be able to provide input and that RTD had spent time negotiating in good faith.

Director Deadwyler asked if staff could update the Board on what was being done to correct the problems. She said that constituents did not want to hear about litigation but rather what RTD is doing to fix the problems.

General Manager Genova said that the technical work on the grade crossings and the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) regulatory process was complete. He said the next step would be going through the Colorado Public Utilities Commission (CPUC). He said RTD did not plan on doing anything differently unless the CPUC ordered the agency to do so. He noted that the agency was on the on docket on September 27, 2017, and stated at the CPUC had not yet issued a written ruling. Based on conversations with their staff, he said that the CPUC would likely maintain their denial for additional G Line testing and for the at-grade crossing operations. He said the agency would then file a request for rehearing and would likely go through a hearing process before an administrative law judge, which could take a long time.

Director Francone stated that Director Deadwyler’s question was whether the problems have been fixed and whether the FRA’s decision to grant a waiver would impact the decision. She said the fix was good enough for the FRA.

General Manager Genova said that the FRA accepted RTD’s crossing design.

Director Deadwyler asked why RTD was operating under a waiver.

General Manager Genova said that was how the FRA wanted to proceed. He said that the FRA would have allowed RTD to remove the flaggers. Going forward, he said that the FRA would need to approve the agency’s forthcoming safety outreach plan. He said that the FRA approved the removal of flaggers from the B Line, but he noted that the only at-grade crossing on that line was not a public crossing. He said that the flaggers could be removed following the PUC process.

Director Deadwyler asked what she could tell her constituents.

General Manager Genova suggesting telling them that the FRA has approved the design but the PUC did not. He said he would be meeting with the chair of the PUC and the staff of the Governor’s Office staff to make sure they understand the project, the quiet zone process, and the fact that RTD built a corridor the agency could not operate. He noted that DTP had ramped up its communications and was doing things without asking RTD’s permission, such as conducting their own interview. He said DTP was doing things to escalate the situation that RTD was not involved in.

Director Deadwyler asked whether RTD could issue a cease and desist order.

General Manager Genova said that the contract with DTP was silent on the issue of communications. He stated that the agency would send DTP send written letter about the matter. He said the Mayor of Arvada and Arvada’s City council have signed a letter and submitted it to the CPUC questioning how the CPUC could have denied RTD’s submittal when the FRA had approved it.

Chair Hoy said that the CPUC felt blindsided by RTD’s application. He said the commissioners questioned what information they had missed, given that the FRA approved the agency’s long-term waiver.

General Manager Genova said that the CPUC was stuck on their own process.

Chair Hoy said the commission was pleading for a way to say yes.

General Manager Genova said the CPUC process is different from the FRA process. He said the FRA and RTD had a collaborative process wherein the agency spoke directly to decision-makers within FRA, as opposed to the CPUC process, where the commissioners received recommendations from staff who were more knowledgeable on the issues. He said he was surprised that CPUC staff would recommend that the commission deny RTD’s application.

Chair Hoy said that the CPUC staff knew at some point how the FRA would decide.

Director Menten said that, from what she heard, the CPUC stated that the crossing timing was outside the window of time drivers expect to wait. She said FRA did not concern itself with at-grade crossings. She asked why RTD should expect the CPUC to change their mind and asked how long of a window was acceptable.

General Manager Genova said there was only a minimum and no specific regulation that sets an upper limit on warning times. He noted there are acceptable standards and guidance documents. He said that the CPUC was hung up on the issue of timing and that, if a gate crossing was designed to be closed for 30 seconds, the CPUC expects operation close to that time. He stated that CPUC staff was reluctant to allow a 15 second buffer for the gate arms following the passing of a train, though the FRA had approved the buffer. He said CPUC was concerned that RTD was backing into a result rather than providing an engineering solution. He said that, at the same time, CPUC staff could not point to anything other than non-regulator guidance documents to back up their assertion.

Chair Hoy said the problem was that the agency was doing something nobody else anywhere in the country had done before and regulators are stuck. It’s not the old school signaling tech.

Director Menten mentioned the FRA letter on the remaining conditions for RTD. She said the General Manager stated the agency was through the FRA process, but she noted that certain steps remained, such as removing flaggers, doing safety outreach training, and other items.

Director Francone said that the FRA had approved RTD’s plans.

General Manager Genova clarified that the FRA had approved RTD’s plan for the B Line but noted that RTD had not yet submitted the request for the University of Colorado A Line. He said that the FRA would claim to be a safety organization, though they do not have specific regulatory authority over grade crossings, which lies with PUC. He said the FRA does have broader authority over commuter rail.

Director Menten said she had reached out to the City of Arvada to make sure they are on schedule once the G Line was approved. She said her contact had not regularly dealt with rail crossings and was unfamiliar with the quiet zone process, which would require another set of steps following G Line approval.

General Manager Genova said the agency was already in talks with the FRA about the quiet zone process.

Director Deadwyler asked whether the gate crossings were functioning as intended.

General Manger Genova stated that they were.

Director Deadwyler said that drivers were not used to anticipating long delays at the crossing gates when two trains passed in opposite directions.

General Manager Genova said the delay in such instances had been part of the design.

Director Deadwyler said that at times freight trains also add to the delay, which is what the public did not understand. She said the public thought there was a problem with getting the gate arms up.

General Manager Genova said that the crossing gates were designed not to activate for a second train at the crossing unless the second train arrived shortly after the fist. He noted there are two RTD tracks in the corridor along with two freight tracks.

Chair Hoy asked whether the committee approved the agenda as amended.

Motion:               Chair Hoy made the motion to approve moving the October 24th Board agenda to the full Board.

Director Walker seconded the motion.

Vote on

Motion:               The motion passed with 5 in favor and 0 opposed.

## III. Other Matters

General Manager Genova said that the committee may have already seen an email from the National Western Center requesting a station change. He said staff would review the Board’s established policy and report back.

Director Deadwyler asked whether the Board should speak with the National Western Center about naming rights.

Director Menten said that there were two other neighborhoods served at that station that were not included in the station name, which was already long.

General Manager Genova said that the station is located in the Elyria neighborhood.

Director Francone said that surveys for the General Manager’s performance had been sent out. She said she would contact the Directors to ensure a good response and said that staff can assist if anyone had problems.

Director Menten handed out Director Lubow’s proposal for a Board-only retreat. She suggested that the committee members could take it home and think it over.

Chair Hoy said he had been moving toward a Board-only retreat for months and anticipated that it would happen. He stated everyone had thoughts on how it should be run or whether it would be of value, but he stated that the retreat would be separate from the annual joint Board and Senior Leadership (SLT) retreat.

Director Menten said she would send out an email with her own thoughts.

Chair Hoy said that he had socialized the idea with the Directors to get a sense of how they felt and had received a range of responses.

Director Francone stated the retreat would be effective only if whole Board participated.

Chair Hoy said that even those Directors who said the retreat would be a waste of time said they would show up.

Director Deadwyler said that the Directors often did not show up for meetings.

Chair Hoy said the retreat probably would not happen in 2017 and may not happen at all if the next Chair did not approve it.

Ms. McManus handed out the proposed 2018 Board calendar and noted that possible dates for a Board-only retreat. She said the joint Board/SLT retreat would likely be held on March 3.

Director Deadwyler said that the Board could vote on holding the retreat, which decision the future chair would have to abide by.

Ms. McManus noted that the dates could change if the retreat were held during work hours.

Chair Hoy noted that the Board-only retreat did not preclude the Board sitting down with SLT.

Director Deadwyler said the Board-only retreat should be held before the joint retreat.

Ms. McManus said that the General Manager had socialized the proposed Board calendar in SLT and asked the Assistant General Managers think strategically about the whole year strategically to spread the work evenly across meetings. She said that doing so would not necessarily preclude long meetings and that, even with weekly meetings, long meetings just happen because of the timing of certain items.

Chair Hoy said that the Board should simplify how it approves and moves certain budget items. He said two or three of the items from the last meeting were bookkeeping matters and should not have required Board action.

Director Deadwyler asked why Directors speak about items that are not worthy of comments.

Chair Hoy said that what the Board did on Tuesday had nothing to do with Board other than the Board’s authority regarding contracts.

Director Menten said she was not bothered by the length of meetings.

Chair Hoy said she was not the only one to say that.

Director Francone said that in a perfect world every meeting would take about an hour and that, for a night with three meetings, the Board should be done by 8:30 p.m.

Director Deadwyler said that she typically budgeted an hour for each meeting when making Access-a-Ride arrangements and that she did not like missing meetings.

Chair Hoy said that was a problem with Access-a-Ride that the Board should address. He said the Board would discuss later on if the change in the frequency of meetings was better or worse.

Ms. McManus said that the Board could create meetings based on the needs of the business.

Chair Hoy said that study session could function as placeholders for meetings. He said that in the past staff provided recommended actions and updates simply because a meeting was scheduled. He said that meetings were scheduled 12 months in advance and that the change was an effort to have real meetings with real accomplishments.

Ms. McManus said that a committee meeting could be held in place of a study session and that the idea was to be fluid for the needs of business and make committee meetings less invasive.

Director Deadwyler said she would not mind early morning meetings.

Chair Hoy said that county commissioners work all day long.

General Manager Genova noted that committee meetings used to take place during lunchtime and that committees of the whole were not used at that time.

Director Francone said that evening meetings allow people to attend.

Chair Hoy asked how meetings could be made more accessible.

Ms. McManus said that the next topic would cover that matter. She and John McKay, Board Office Administrator, presented a preview of the video recording and closed captioning software that the Board would use to capture and display its meetings in the near future. She said the front end of the video project was nearing completion and that the Public Information team was in the process of putting out a request for proposals (RFP) to select vendors to operate the video cameras and to provide captioning and transcript files for each meeting. She said that the video recordings of meetings would be hosted alongside the agendas and minutes on the Board of Directors website and would allow viewers to review meetings at a later date.

Director Menten asked whether the meetings would be archived.

Ms. McManus stated that the software vendor that provided archival storage of the Board’s agendas and minutes was selected to hose the video content.

Mr. McKay noted that the security system would be available to provide backup audio and video files in the event of an interruption of the main audio/video system.
