Local Financial Commitment Criteria
(50 percent of overall rating)
• Current Condition (of the agency) (25% of
financial rating): All four projects likely to
receive a rating of Medium (consistent with
Southeast Rail Extension).
• Commitment of Funds (for the project) (25%
of financial rating): All four projects likely to receive
a rating of Low. RTD does not have capital and operating
funds committed or budgeted for these projects. This
rating could be raised (with 3rd party funding) by
committing or budgeting 10, 30, 50, or 75 percent of the
non-Federal funding (SERE rating was Medium-High).

identify access to funds necessary to cover
capital and operating cost increases or capital
and operating funding shortfalls related to
these projects. This rating could be raised by
identifying 10, 15, 25, or 50 percent of the

Local Financial Commitment Criteria
• Conclusion on Financial Commitment:
These four projects would not achieve a
Medium rating based on current and
anticipated RTD financial projections and
forecasts. Significant RTD and non-RTD
sources would need to be committed and
budgeted to raise the rating above Low. (SERE
received an overall Financial rating of High due to
significant non-5309 overmatch by RTD and
stakeholders).

Conclusions Regarding New and Small Starts
• Only one project, Central Rail Extension, is
likely to achieve a Medium rating for Project
Justification Criteria.
• None of the projects, absent significant
financial movement, are likely to receive a
Medium rating for Financial Commitment.
• For these reasons, none of the four projects is
a candidate to enter Project Development in
the foreseeable future without significant
external resources and commitments.

The following are items for July 5, 2016:
1. CCA Transportation Funding Proposals – The Colorado Contractors Association decided
to hold off on pursuing an initiated tax increase ballot measure in 2016. The 10 proposals
lacked dedicated funding for transit and other multi-modal transportation (bicycle,
pedestrian, etc.) and revenues generated would have been inequitably distributed.
2. CML Summer Conference – The Colorado Municipal League (CML) held its summer
conference June 21-24. CRL hosted a dinner which was well attended by elected
officials and city managers from the metro area.

Re:

Update

The Joint Budget Committee reviewed the June revenue forecast on June 15th. Overall, the
forecast shows slow economic growth in both Colorado and the US in 2016 and 2017. The
numbers do not show Colorado moving into a recession but there was a great deal of caution
from both forecasts on the economic landscape for Colorado.
According to the Legislative Council forecast FY2016-17, General Fund revenue is expected to
be $268.3 million which is 2.6 percent short of the amount needed to fully fund the budget and
the required reserve. The OSPB forecast shows a smaller shortfall a budget difference. While
concerning, the June forecast is the least impactful as there are many months between now and
when budget decisions need to be made for the next fiscal year.
According to both forecasts, no TABOR refunds are expected for tax years 2016 and 2017,
however there is a possibility of a refund in tax year 2018.
In FY2015-16 (current budget year, ending on June 30, 2016) no funds are expected to be
diverted from the General Fund as a result of SB16-218 The BP America Production Co vs.
Colorado Department of Revenue. Severance tax revenues are expected to be sufficient to
address the current refunds. There is significant uncertainty on the amount of future refunds
moving forward. The Department of Revenue is in an extensive rulemaking process to look into
the issue further and it is expected that in October DOR would have a better idea of the transfer
amounts.
The primary was held on June 28th. BBMK will provide an update on key races and how this
might impact the balance of power in the House and Senate.
The Transportation Legislation Review Committee (TLRC) has scheduled two tours in July
visiting Craig, Glenwood Springs, Alamosa and Antonito. The first legislative meeting is on
August 1st which will include a presentation from CDOT and discussion of HB16-1031 a bill
sponsored by Rep. Carver and Senator Cooke that looked at changes to the transportation
commission districts.
BBMK has been following the potential ballot initiatives of interest to the District. To date all
the ballot initiatives proposed that would have attempted to fund transportation projects and
transit have been removed from the ballot by the proponents.

FEDERAL UPDATE FOR REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT: JULY 5, 2016



The Senate has passed its Transportation/HUD (“THUD”) appropriations bill to fund
federal transportation programs for the coming year. While most highway and transit
programs are funded directly through the FAST Act independent of the appropriations
process, the Senate THUD appropriations bill does provide funding for the very popular
transit New Starts and TIGER programs.



The House has passed its THUD appropriations bill out of Committee – providing robust
funding for New Starts and TIGER as well – but further action on the THUD bill in the
House is unlikely, as floor consideration of appropriations bills has been stalled by
controversial amendments and a sit-in over gun control legislation.



What’s next? It is a near certainty that Congress will not be able to pass all 12 individual
appropriations bills this year. Instead, Congress is expected to pass a short-term Continuing
Resolution before the end of the federal fiscal year (on September 30) to fund all
departments and programs of the federal government at current-year funding levels for
several weeks – likely until mid-November when Congress re-convenes after the presidential
election.



During their lame duck session after the election, Congress is expected adopt an Omnibus
appropriations bill to fund all agencies and programs federal government for the remainder
of FY 2017.

Announcement of TIGER Grant Awards Expected:




Within the next several weeks, it is widely understood that US DOT will announce the
projects to be awarded funding under the eighth round of the TIGER program. RTD seeks
up to $12.85 million in TIGER funding for proactive state of good repair work on the aging
Central Corridor.
TIGER remains a highly popular and intensely competitive grant program for innovative,
multimodal capital projects. US DOT announced in June that 585 TIGER applications
seeking $9.3 billion were submitted for the $500 million in available TIGER funding – so
project applications total almost 19 times the available funding.

Amendment to Lease for Office Space at Civic
Center Plaza – 1560 Broadway, Suites 510,
605, 610, 700, 1000, 1075 and 1099

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager or his designee to negotiate and execute all documents necessary to amend and
extend the lease agreements by and between the Regional Transportation District and CO-Denver Post
Tower, LLC, formerly known as CO-One Civic Center Plaza, LLC and EOP-One Civic Center Plaza, LLC
for office space in Suites 510, 605, 610, 650, 700, 1000, 1075 and 1099 on the 5 th, 6th, 7th and 10th
floors, containing approximately 84,903 square feet, in the building commonly known as Civic Center
Plaza for Planning and Capital Programs personnel, IT personnel, Paratransit Services and Contracted
Services. This amendment will consolidate all leased space into one lease, will add approximately 3,046
square feet to the 6th floor and will amend and extend all previous leases and amendments to provide for
all to expire on December 31, 2022. On the original 73,480 square feet, base rent began at $16.50 per
square foot, has increased annually by $0.50 and will conclude in the final year of the lease at $21.50
per square foot, January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2022. (Rent for the remaining 11,423 square
feet will be $20.00 per square foot in the final year). Funding for the space to be used by the FasTracks
program was included in the 2015 Annual Program Evaluation, and will be appropriated in future year
budgets. Funding for the space to be used by the base system will be appropriated in future year
budgets.
BACKGROUND
In 2005 the Planning and Development Department of RTD required office space for employees and
contractors to be housed together for the management, planning, design and construction of the
FasTracks Project. Property Management with the assistance of a broker viewed and evaluated several
downtown office buildings within a reasonable distance of RTD’s main administrative office at 1600
Blake Street and adjacent to transit. Several other factors, including cost, network cabling, ability to
expand and public meeting facilities were used in evaluating space. Currently, RTD’s Planning and
Capital Programs departments and IT personnel occupy the space on the 5th, 6th and 7th floors of the
Civic Center Plaza. In January of 2006, Paratransit Services and its related call center moved into the
building on the 10th floor. In May 2012, IT required additional space on the 10th floor and a lease was
entered into.
DISCUSSION
The proposed lease extension for the current office space and the addition of 3,046 square feet on the
6th floor will provide needed office space for the current users through 2022. The Civic Center Building
is considered to be Class A office space. Current market rents for Class A office space average $24 per
square foot, with operating expenses at approximately $9.00 per square foot for a total rent per square
foot of approximately $33. The lease extension as negotiated provides for a base rent of $16.50 per

Packet Pg. 36

3.B.1

square foot annually with a $0.50 per square foot annual increase. In addition, RTD is responsible for
its’ pro rata share of operating expenses, historically and currently approximately $7.00 per square foot
annually. At approximately $23.50 to $26 per square foot, the negotiated extension is below or at
market rate.
Using information collected from CoStar, JLL (Jones Lang Lasalle) and other sources, lease comparables
were evaluated. Recent renewal rates average just over $40.00 per square foot in gross effective rent
(including operating expenses and net of rent abatement). As part of the negotiation of the extension
and amendment, a tenant improvement allowance of $1,056,910.00 will be given to RTD who will have
the option to apply toward tenant improvements or to defray future rents. Extension of the current
leases will provide a significant presence at the newly refurbished Civic Center Station and provide
needed office space.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Annualized base rent for the entire leases premises will be approximately $1.5 million for the first year
and approximately $1.8 in the final year. Funding for future year leases of office space to be used by the
FasTracks program is included in future years in the 2015 Annual Program Evaluation, and the funding
for space used by the base system will be appropriated annually. RTD has the ability to use the
approximate $2.2 million allowance provided by owner at any time during the term of the lease
(approximately $1.2 million from previous extension and $1 million with the current extension).
ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the General Manager or his designee to negotiate and execute all documents necessary
to amend and extend the lease agreements by and between the Regional Transportation District
and CO-Denver Post Tower, LLC, formerly known as CO-One Civic Center Plaza, LLC and EOPOne Civic Center Plaza, LLC for office space in Suites 510, 605, 610, 650, 700, 1000, 1075
and 1099 on the 5th, 6th, 7th and 10th floors, containing approximately 84,903 square feet, in the
building commonly known as Civic Center Plaza for Planning and Capital Programs personnel, IT
personnel, Paratransit Services and Competitive Services and Transportation Contracts. This
amendment will consolidate all leased space into one lease, will add approximately 3,046 sq. ft.
to the 6th floor and will amend and extend all previous leases and amendments to provide for all
to expire on December 31, 2022. On the original 73,480 sq. ft., base rent began at $16.50 per
square foot base rent and has increased annually by $0.50 and will conclude in the final year of
the lease at $21.50 per sq. ft., January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2022. (Rent for the
remaining 11,423 sq. ft. will be $20.00 per sq. ft. in the final year). Funding for the space to be
used by the FasTracks program was included in the 2015 Annual Program Evaluation, and will be
appropriated in future year budgets. Funding for the space to be used by the base system will be
appropriated in future year budgets.
2. Do not authorize the General Manager or his designee to negotiate and execute all documents
necessary to amend and extend the lease agreements by and between the Regional
Transportation District and CO-Denver Post Tower, LLC, formerly known as CO-One Civic Center
Plaza, LLC and EOP-One Civic Center Plaza, LLC for office space in Suites 510, 605, 610, 650,
700, 1000, 1075 and 1099 on the 5th, 6th, 7th and 10th floors, containing approximately 84,903
square feet, in the building commonly known as Civic Center Plaza.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and
CEO

Date: July 5, 2016

From:

Henry Stopplecamp, Acting Assistant
General Manager, Capital Programs

GM

Date:

June 24, 2016

Board Meeting Date: July 19, 2016

Subject:

Acquisition of Easements - Southwest Plaza
Transfer Center

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors pass the
attached resolution certifying easements as necessary for construction of the Southwest Plaza Transfer
Center project and authorize staff to proceed with all requisite legal process under state eminent domain
law.
BACKGROUND
RTD must obtain possession of and make available to the contractor for the construction of the
Southwest Plaza Transfer project the right of way necessary for certain utility easements for the
construction of the project. Easement needs will be identified and specific legal descriptions prepared
beginning the formal acquisition process. This process begins with good faith negotiations, but may
ultimately result in court proceedings under eminent domain law. Staff would like to proceed with the
acquisition of the easements identified, subject to any modifications or additions required by the
contractor and/or construction activities.
DISCUSSION
State and federal law mandate that specific procedures be followed in the acquisition of property,
including easements, for a public project when the acquiring governmental entity has powers of eminent
domain. RTD staff and its outside counsel and property acquisition consultants are familiar with and
adhere to these processes, which commence with offers and good faith negotiations, but may result in
court filing and eminent domain proceeding to resolve property acquisitions. The attached resolution and
right of way plan specifies the property that has been delineated by design and authorizes the General
Manager and/or his designee to certify specific legal descriptions of the needed properties.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Acquisition of right of way is included in the project budget for the Southwest Plaza Transfer Center
project.

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT
RESOLUTION NO. ______ SERIES OF 2016
SOUTHWEST PLAZA TRANSFER CENTER PROJECT EASEMENT ACQUISITION

Whereas, the Board has reviewed and approved maps of the Southwest Plaza
Transfer Center Project; and
Whereas, the Board has reviewed the attached Right of Way plan;
Whereas, the RTD will conduct good faith negotiations and make an offer of just
compensation to acquire the easements; and
Whereas, to ensure timely completion of the Project, it may be necessary to initiate
condemnation proceedings to acquire the identified easements and to obtain
immediate possession of the easements; and
Whereas, consistent with the intent of the Project, the RTD or its designee shall
have the authority to amend (enlarge, decrease or change) the legal descriptions of
the easements as it deems necessary in the best interests of the Project; and
Whereas, the RTD is empowered pursuant to the laws of the State of Colorado to
exercise the power of eminent domain in the manner provided by Article I of Title
38, C.R.S.
Whereas, the Board recognizes that each and every property owner impacted by
the Southwest Plaza Transfer Center Project, although financially compensated
according to the law, makes a significant personal sacrifice for the public good, a
sacrifice not made by others who benefit from the Project.
Now, Therefore Be It Resolved That:
The Board hereby finds and determines that the Project constitutes a public
purpose, that there is a public need and necessity to acquire the easements within
the corridor for and in furtherance of a public purpose, and that the acquisitions are
for the benefit of the public health, welfare and safety.
The Board directs that the General Manager and/or the Project Managers, as
the Board’s delagatees, shall certify the specific legal descriptions of the needed
easements.

Packet Pg. 41

3.B.2

The Board directs that the RTD delagatees should negotiate in good faith for
the acquisition of the easements and if the delagatee is unable to acquire any
easement through good faith negotiations, then the RTD may acquire such
easement through the exercise of the power of eminent domain.
The Board finds and determines that the RTD should obtain possession of
the easements as soon as permitted by law.
Made and adopted this ___ day of _________________, 2016.
