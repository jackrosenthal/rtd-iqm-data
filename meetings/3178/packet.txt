BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Approval of Contract to Purchase Validators for AccountBased Ticketing

Committee Meeting Date:
April 13, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
April 13, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager or her designee to enter into a contract with
Masabi to purchase new bus and rail platform fare validators for the Account-Based Ticketing (ABT)
system.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Ford, Chief Operations Officer
Doug MacLeod, Acting Chief Financial Officer
Tonya Anderson, Senior Project Manager
Paul Snyder, Senior Project Manager
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
In November 2020, the RTD Board of Directors approved the funding needed to advance the AccountBased Ticketing (ABT) system forward with the goal of replacing the cumbersome and obsolete existing
Smart Card fare technology and equipment used for the MyRide card and College and Eco Passes.
The existing Smart Card system is card-based, in which customer balances and transactions are stored
on individual cards. This causes several issues: delays of 24 to 72 hours for customers and RTD in
managing card balances; hampers the ability to perform stored value transactions; limits locations for
card management; limits the types of fares available; and requires more intensive ongoing system
maintenance, coding, and Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliance activities. In contrast, account-based
fare systems, such as ABT, store information by account, allowing for such benefits as real-time
information, the ability for more widespread and varied means of loading fare value, more fare offerings
and flexibility in changing fares, and less maintenance through utilization of hosted environment, all
while also ensuring PCI compliance.
In considering the replacement of the Smart Card system with ABT, RTD has contracted with Masabi to
provide the “back office” technology to be consistent and compatible with RTD’s existing mobile
ticketing platform that is also provided by Masabi. The current target date for completion of this portion
of the ABT implementation is December 31, 2021.
DISCUSSION
A second component of the ABT implementation is the replacement of existing fare validators that were
purchased in 2010 for RTD’s Smart Card fare system. The existing validators have obsolete and
proprietary technology specific to the existing Smart Card system which necessitates replacement with
validators that are ABT compatible.

Packet Pg. 4

1.B.1

These new ABT validators will bring RTD into the modern age of transit payment systems while
providing RTD customers with an improved and easier method for transit payments. Additionally, these
new ABT fare validators will be capable of processing open payments, thereby providing additional fare
payment options to RTD’s customers. Installation of the ABT fare validators is planned with a phased
approach as the legacy Smart Card fare validators are removed.
In order to acquire ABT fare validators, RTD issued a Request for Proposal (RFP) separate from the “back
office” ABT software procurement. This RFP was separate in order to ensure a competitive process and
because these fare validators will be acquired to be compatible with most ABT systems. In addition,
federal grant funding has been awarded to RTD for the ABT fare validator purchase.
After a thorough RFP evaluation and scoring procurement process, Masabi was selected as the preferred
validator vendor and negotiations were completed. The funds needed to complete this work are
$4,054,505, of which $1,813,084 comes from federal funding and, if approved, will allow RTD to work
towards achieving the planned ABT system go-live date December 31, 2021 with a phased-in fare
validator replacement. The period of performance for fare validator replacement is tentatively planned
for October 2021 through December 2021.
The validator vendor was evaluated and selected on a best value basis with the following scoring
criteria:
•
•
•
•
•

40% technical specifications and ability to meet stated requirements
20% overall cost
20% experience of the vendor and project team
10% timeline and ability to meet deadlines
10% DBE (Disadvantaged Business Enterprises) evaluation

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The estimated cost of contracting the replacement ABT fare validators is $4,054,505. Funding will be
provided by RTD in the amount of $2,241,421 plus federal grant funding in the amount of $1,813,084
both of which were included in the 2021 budget. This contract will have five one-year options for
extended hardware and firmware support in the amount of $29,946 annually. If all five options are
exercised, this will result in an additional cost of $149,730.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Budget Transfer for Railroad Liability Insurance Premiums

Committee Meeting Date:
April 13, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
April 13, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager or her designee to authorize a budget
transfer of $400,000 to fund increased commuter rail liability insurance coverage and premiums for
the N-line.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Melanie J. Snyder, General Counsel
Doug MacLeod, Acting Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
Section 24-10-115(7), C.R.S., requires a public entity that obtains insurance for claims arising from
passenger rail operations to insure against the federal liability cap set forth in 49 U.S.C. § 28103. RTD
maintains insurance for the N-line consistent with contractual requirements for easements from BNSF
and Suncor. Pursuant to the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act, on February 26, 2021,
the U.S. Department of Transportation issued a notice of adjustment to the Rail Passenger
Transportation Liability Cap from $294,278,983 to $322,864,228. In order to increase its insurance
limits to meet this increased cap, RTD has identified insurance providers to provide this increased
coverage which has resulted in higher insurance premiums that were not budgeted.
DISCUSSION
RTD is seeking Board approval to transfer funds from the General Manager’s Contingency Fund to fund
the increased insurance premiums since the amount of the transfer exceeds the General Manager’s
authority. The increased premiums total $362,597 for the insurance coverage period of March 26,
2021 – September 30, 2021. This request seeks a transfer of $400,000 to allow for foreign currency
translation adjustments since the insurance providers are domiciled in Bermuda and any unencumbered
funds will be used for the next renewal period beginning October 1, 2021 or returned to the General
Manager Contingency Fund.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The General Manager Contingency Fund was appropriated by the Board with the approval of the 2021
Budget. Therefore, there is no net financial impact to the 2021 Budget, however, the financial impact to
RTD annually will be increased premiums of approximately $800,000.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Request for Budget Transfer Paratransit Software
Replacement

Committee Meeting Date:
April 13, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
April 13, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager or her designee to authorize a budget
transfer of up to $4,000,000 to fund activities for the upcoming Paratransit Software Replacement
contract.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Ford, Chief Operations Officer
Paul Hamilton, Senior Manager, Paratransit Services
Eric Farrington, Senior Project Manager, Information Technology
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
In 2008, RTD began using Routematch software to schedule paratransit service. This software, still in
use, is costly and outdated. RTD needs a new software system. The software does not offer mobile or
web portal trip booking and management for customers. IT staff developed portals to address this
shortcoming. As it stands, the software lacks basic modern functionality needed to optimize and fully
support the Agency’s paratransit customer base. Additionally, Routematch has developed a new cloudbased product and will cease to support RTD’s current system. Thus, the system requires replacement
due to obsolescence.
DISCUSSION
RTD needs a new software system which would improve productivity over the current system, thereby
saving RTD approximately between $2,000,000 and $4,000,000 annually. These savings can be
leveraged to offset the costs for a vendor to implement new technology savings to pay the selected
contractor. RTD is asking proposers to work at risk, based on confidence that they will be able to
improve productivity and be paid from the productivity savings. Due to the budget forecasting in 2020
for 2021, whereby budget savings were identified, staff is now seeking authorization to provide funding
through a budget transfer of up to $4,000,000 to fund this work.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The estimated unfunded cost of contracting the replacement software and onboard hardware is less than
$4,000,000. Funding is available from existing operating funds currently designated for Access-a-Ride
fuel and transportation. This is in anticipation that those proceeds will not be needed for their original
intent due to reductions in fuel and operating costs due to increased Access-a-Ride productivity.
Therefore, there would be no budgetary impact, rather a transfer of funds would be completed from
Operating Funds into Capital Projects.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
COVID-19 Relief Funding and RTD Financial Update

Committee Meeting Date:
April 13, 2021

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Debra A. Johnson, General Manager and CEO
Doug MacLeod, Acting Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD has received notice of three COVID-19 relief federal funding grant apportionments. Each of those
apportionments are in various stages of having been drawn or RTD is awaiting further guidance from the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) regarding allowable expenditures. It is clear from the preliminary
guidance provided by the FTA that these apportionments must be used to maintain the core business of
transit agencies which is service delivery.
DISCUSSION
The financial impact to RTD from the COVID-19 Pandemic began in March 2020 and had the impact of
reducing fare revenue by $81.9 million and sales and use tax revenue by $32.1 million in 2020. This
adverse impact to RTD’s revenues is expected to continue during 2021 and beyond. A great deal of
uncertainty remains regarding RTD’s financial outlook, particularly during the six-year Mid-term Financial
Plan (MTFP) timeframe through 2026.
This uncertainty stems from an inability to determine if or when there may be a return to normalcy for
transit or what the future state of transit will be.
In regard to expected timing of the emergence from the COVID-19 Pandemic, in mid-February 2021, Dr.
Anthony Fauci, Chief Medical Advisor to the President, said “Hopefully by the time we start entering
2022, we really will have a degree of normality that will approximate the kind of normality we’ve been
used to.” Jen Psaki, White House Press Secretary followed by saying “We are not in a place where we
can predict exactly when everybody will feel normal again.”
As such, staff continues to closely monitor RTD’s financial results and outlook and will continue to
provide information to the RTD Board of Directors as events develop. The intent of this Discussion item
is to provide a current update of financial activities since the MTFP was approved in November 2020
and to provide information on the remaining financial challenges ahead.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
April 13, 2021

Sales and Use Tax Forecast Presentation

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Acting Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD’s Fiscal Policy requires that:
RTD will contract with a qualified third party to provide sales and use tax forecasting containing
projections for the short-term (one year by quarter), mid-term (six-year Mid-Term Financial Plan period)
and long-term (30-year Long Range Financial Plan period). The purpose is to provide RTD with expert
economic analysis and sales and use tax forecasts using sophisticated financial modeling techniques not
available internally.
As such, RTD has contracted with the Business Research Division of the University of Colorado Leeds
School of Business (CU Leeds) to provide semi-annual sales and use tax forecast model reports in March
and September to coincide with the development of RTD’s annual budget and six-year Mid-term
Financial Plan (MTFP). The provision of the forecast model report is followed by a presentation to the
RTD Board by CU Leeds in April and October.
DISCUSSION
RTD utilized the September 2020 sales and use tax forecast in the 2021-2026 MTFP of which the Board
approved years of 2021-2022 while declining to approve years 2023-2026 due to the uncertainty
resulting from the COVID-19 Pandemic.
The March 2021 Forecast Model Report reflects a projected improvement from the September forecast
in RTD’s sales and use taxes through 2029 and a reduction in years 2030-2050.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The March 2021 Forecast Model Report results in the following changes to the sales and use tax
forecast from the September 2020 Forecast Model Report:

2021-2026 MTFP
2021-2050 Long-range Financial Plan

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

Colorado recorded its first COVID-19 case on March 5, 2020. One week later, school districts began
to announce closures, followed by ski resorts on March 15th; the statewide stay-at-home orders took
effect March 25. The pandemic-induced recession had a swift, negative impact on RTD sales and use
taxes in 2020. While January and February recorded moderate year-over-year growth of 4.9% and
4%, respectively, March gave way to a 17% decline in year-over-year revenue as consumers became
cautious with the unknowns about the spread of the virus and the government instituted the
temporary closure of businesses. RTD sales and use tax revenue declined 4.1% in 2020. A revenue
recovery is projected for RTD in 2021, with forecasted growth of 8% that will push revenue to a new
record level.
Figure 1

RTD revenues are collected primarily within seven metropolitan counties (the “district”): Adams,
Arapahoe, Boulder, Broomfield, Denver, Douglas, and Jefferson, as well as a portion of Weld County.
Colorado and the Denver Metro region posted strong, above average economic growth following the
2007-2009 “Great Recession.” RTD recorded 10 consecutive years of sales and use tax growth
averaging 5.9% between 2010 and 2019. The pandemic recession created a drop in GDP, led to an
unprecedented decline in employment, and caused a sharp decrease in RTD revenue. The economy,
labor market, and RTD revenue are all showing signs of recovery.
A model was developed to examine fundamental relationships between U.S. and Colorado economic
growth, and between Colorado and the district. It forecasts short-term, medium-term, and longterm RTD sales and use tax revenue, and accounts for economic and demographic (e.g., population
age) shifts over time.
Economic Update
•
•

The COVID-19 pandemic created a sharp and profound negative impact upon the economy.
Real (inflation-adjusted) U.S. GDP in Q2 2020 decreased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate
(SAAR) of 31.4% (9% year-over-year), but rebounded 33.4% (SAAR) in Q3 2020 (-2.8% yearover-year) and 4.1% in Q4 2020 (-2.4% year-over-year). Real GDP in 2021 is projected to
increase 4.9%, reaching a new record high, but remaining below potential GDP.

Executive Summary

1.C.2.b

•

•
•

•

Despite the recession and record losses in employment and wage and salary income,
personal income posted strong gains in 2020 due to a record increase in government
transfer receipts (e.g., unemployment benefits, household stimulus checks).
The increase in personal income and the lack of spending on services shifted personal
consumption to goods, which softened the recession’s impact on taxable goods in Colorado.
Nationally, 22.2 million jobs were lost in March and April (-14.5%). From May 2020 through
February 2021, the nation added back 12.9 million jobs, but total employment remained
down 6.2% from the peak.
Consumer and business sentiment both dropped significantly since the onset of the
pandemic on the U.S. economy, but confidence has rebounded as the economy reopened.

Short-Term Outlook
•

•

•

•

•
•
•

•
•
•

RTD sales and use tax revenue increased 6% in 2018 and 4% in 2019. Revenue subsequently
declined by 4.1% in 2020, due to the pandemic. Revenue is projected to rebound in 2021,
growing 8% to a record-high $683 million.
Coming off a recession year, employment is projected to increase 1.8% in 2021 and 4.2% in
2022. Statewide total personal income was unaffected by the recession due to government
assistance; personal income growth accelerated an estimated 6.4% in 2020 and is projected
to increase 5.3% in 2021. The unemployment rate is projected to average 6.5% in 2021 and
to improve further to 4.5% in 2022.
The Governor’s Executive Order that extended the retail sales tax filing deadline and waived
penalties caused a delay in the RTD’s sales and use tax collections early in the pandemic.
This suggested a more pronounced decline in RTD revenue than actually occurred as delayed
revenue showed up as late payments.
The forecasting model also provides information on uncertainty that is inherent in any
forecast through construction of confidence bounds on total RTD revenues. The mean
forecast for 2021 of $683 million is bracketed by 67% confidence bounds of $666 million on
the low side and $700 million for the upper bound.
The mean forecast for 2022 is $726 million, bound by a lower bound of $701 million and an
upper bound of $751 million.
The 67% upper- and lower-bound estimates illustrate the broad uncertainty behind
economic conditions that pose upside opportunities and downside risks to the forecast.
Quarterly growth exhibits more volatility than annual growth, and use taxes are more
volatile than sales taxes. The third and fourth quarters tend to be the largest revenue
quarters for RTD.
Forecasts of national indicators that are used to drive state and district forecasts come from
Moody’s Analytics.
The September 2020 revenue forecasts for Q3 and Q4 2020 were low by 2.8% and 4.1%,
respectively, illustrating the rapid recovery of revenue in the second half of 2020.
The government response to this pandemic reversed the usual paradigm. Instead of
declining income, the direct government transfers resulted in sharply higher household
income and spending than the model predicted. Thus, sales tax revenue outperformed
expectations.

For the short-term forecast, the BRD estimates have been above the actual revenue 73
times and below the actual revenue 84 times, and a simple average of the error has been 0.8%, with a 4.4% standard deviation (including the rapid revenue swings during the
pandemic recession).

The impact of COVID-19 on the retail and restaurant industries, employment, income, and
tourism weighed heavily on retail sales activity.
The past two post-recession recovery periods lasted 4.5 years and 4.75 years, before RTD
revenues returned to their previous revenue peaks. However, RTD will likely surpass the
prior revenue peak after just two years (2020 and 2021) from the onset of the current
recession due to both the nature of the recession and the government response.
Modeling three economic scenarios helps to accommodate the broad uncertainty
surrounding the U.S. economy. These scenarios may be taken as plausible bounds on RTD
revenue growth over the medium-term period; the greatest variation in forecasts occurs
during the first three years.
Under the baseline scenario, RTD total tax revenues are projected to grow by 41% between
2020 and 2027, reaching $892 million by the end of the medium-term horizon.
A more optimistic scenario under which the national economy experiences a faster rebound
yields cumulative revenues 3.2% higher than the baseline scenario over the seven-year
horizon; however, the 2027 total is 4% above the baseline forecast, illustrating the value of a
faster recovery.
A second alternative scenario in which the national economy experiences slower growth in
the near term yields a cumulative 7-year forecast 2.2% below the baseline scenario.
The paradox of the 7-year forecast producing similar 2027 revenues points to the very shortrun nature of the current Moody’s alternative scenarios.
There may be higher inflationary pressure on the horizon caused by excess household
savings, high commodity prices, and a sudden tightening of the labor market.
Reflecting on the forecast accuracy before the pandemic, the medium-term forecasts have
proven to have a small margin of error. Five years out, the 2014 forecast for 2019 was high
by 2.1%. The 2015 forecast for 2019 was high by 4.4%, the 2016 forecast for 2019 was low
by 2.3%, the 2017 forecast for 2019 was low by 1.7%, and the 2018 forecast for 2019 was
high by 1.4%.

Long-Term Outlook
•

•
•

After revenue growth of 4.75% for the decade ending in 2020 (in current, nominal dollars),
revenue projections for the next three decades average 4% (2021–2030), 3% (2031–2040),
and 2.5% (2041–2050); the 30-year average is 3.2% (2021–2050).
Long-term revisions are due, in part, to lower expectations in the short-term forecast, as
well as revisions to the long-term population forecasts.
The BRD long-term forecasting model incorporates population growth and shifts in the age
distribution of the population as key factors influencing the rate of growth in output,
employment, and sales.

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

Project Overview

The BRD collaborates with the RTD administration in order to forecast sales and use tax revenues,
and to identify the key drivers that will impact RTD’s tax revenue stream. Since project inception, the
BRD research team has been working closely with the RTD administration in order to better
understand the existing forecast system, to collect and organize relevant data, and to develop the
three sets of projections.
This report presents the revenue projections at the three forecast horizons, with some discussion of
the economic forces driving these forecasts. The model uses vector autoregression (VAR) techniques
in order to capture a mix of long-term, stable relationships, as well as short-term “deviations” from
these long-term trends. These relationships connect RTD tax revenue components to key
macroeconomic drivers, such as retail sales. The methodology is described in detail in the main body
of this report.
RTD revenue data, state retail sales, and state taxable sales are available through December 2020.
Data after these dates represent forecasts. Additional revenue from medical and retail marijuana
sales are in the RTD receipts. Adjustments to the model were necessary to accommodate the gap
year (July 1, 2017–June 30, 2018) in retail marijuana collections caused by Senate Bill 17-267. As
such, RTD taxable sales in this report are based on RTD sales tax revenues excluding retail marijuana
taxes. Therefore, these data are actually RTD taxable sales excluding marijuana sales. However, the
forecasts reported for RTD sales tax revenues include the forecasts of RTD retail marijuana revenues.
This construction was necessary to produce a series without the discontinuity over the period from
July 2017 through June 2018 to produce reasonable revenue forecasts.
In 2016, revenue from Electronic Shopping and Mail-Order Houses (i.e., ecommerce) became a
significant contributor to RTD’s sales tax revenue. Ecommerce accounted for over 8% of the total
sales taxes collected in 2020.
Given the pandemic recession’s impact on specific sectors of the economy, the BRD began modeling
major components of RTD’s sales taxes (e.g., restaurants, auto sales, ecommerce, grocery, etc.).
Modeling the components of retail sales taxes will produce a forecast that accommodates the
volatility in the subcomponents.
The methodology and model descriptions may be found in Appendix A.

In an effort to provide consistent and accurate RTD revenue forecasts, a new sales and use tax
forecasting system was commissioned in 2010. The Business Research Division (BRD) of the Leeds
School of Business at the University of Colorado Boulder was contracted to develop a model for
projecting RTD revenues over the short term (2020), medium term (2027), and long term (2050).

1.C.2.b
RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

Forecasts: Short Term, Medium Term and Long Term

Summary: Following the Great Recession, RTD recorded 10 consecutive years of sales and use tax
growth averaging 5.9% (2010-2019). The pandemic-induced recession caused RTD sales and use tax
revenue to decline 4.1% in 2020. After posting 4% year-over-year growth in February, the
deterioration in revenue took hold in March with a 17% year-over-year decrease. RTD recorded yearover-year losses nine months in 2020. A revenue recovery is projected for RTD in 2021, with
forecasted growth of 8% that will push revenue to a new record level.
Figure 2

All equations are estimated using monthly data to produce monthly forecasts that are aggregated
into quarterly or yearly data. Historical data for Colorado and national economic variables were
retrieved in February 2021, with much of the data current through December 2020. RTD revenue
data and state retail sales and taxable sales data are current through December 2020. All reported
data after these dates are forecasts.
The short-term forecast relies on the Baseline Scenario from Moody’s Analytics. These national
macroeconomic indicators drive the forecasts of the Colorado economy.
Colorado Economy Forecasts
As background to the revenue forecasts, data on Colorado economic indicators are presented in
Table 1. Key indicators of Colorado economic activity reflect the COVID-19 economy in 2020, and the
rebound in 2021. The unemployment rate averaged 7.1% in 2020, but is projected to improve to
6.5% in 2021 and 4.5% in 2022. Personal income grew in 2020 despite the record loss in employment
and employee earnings. Moderate nominal income growth is projected in the short-term, but real
income growth will be comparatively modest due to inflation.

Annual Tax Revenue Forecasts
The following table presents the expected changes in RTD base sales tax revenues and the driving
force behind these changes: taxable sales. From 2010 through 2019, district taxable sales recorded
10 consecutive years of growth averaging 6.1%. Taxable sales fell 3% in 2020, but are projected to
increase 7% in 2021 and 3.3% in 2022. Sales tax revenues are anticipated to change in stride, falling
2.6% in 2020, but rebounding 7.6% and 5.7% in 2021 and 2022, respectively. Note that the model
uses RTD sales tax revenue (less marijuana revenue) to impute taxable retail sales in the sevencounty RTD district because retail marijuana is no longer assessed the 2.9% retail sales tax rate for
the state. However, retail marijuana is taxed 1% for the special districts, leading to a difference in
taxable sales and sales taxes.

The Short-Term Use Tax Revenue Forecast
In this model, use tax revenues are directly related to Colorado use tax collections reflecting the
broader geographical base for the use tax. Households and businesses residing within the district but
purchasing taxable goods outside the district are required to pay a use tax on these purchases at the
same rate as the sales tax. Illustrating the volatility, use tax revenues fell 1.1% in 2015, but increased
7.5% in 2016, 4.6% in 2017, and 25.7% in 2018 before falling 16% in 2019 and 14.3% in 2020. The
forecast calls for rebounding use taxes in 2021 and 2022. The volatility of use taxes is apparent in
both annual and quarterly data.

Upper- and Lower-Bound Estimates for Baseline Forecast
The previous tables present only medium-level forecasts, which should be interpreted as the mean
values within a range of probable outcomes. All forecasting exercises involve elements of
uncertainty, although information about possible forecast errors is seldom presented. Uncertainty
arises from the errors in equation specification and estimation, and from the forecasts of the
national variables that drive the state variables. Although information on the latter source of
uncertainty is not available, the probabilistic high and low forecast bounds that incorporate possible
errors in fitting the equations are presented. The values of the high and low forecast bounds are
computed as 67% confidence bounds, meaning that a 0.67 probability exists that the interval
between low and high forecast values will contain the actual value of the variable being predicted.
The following table displays the 67% confidence bounds on total RTD revenues through 2022. The
wide 67% confidence interval reflects uncertainty. The possible range is as low as $665.7 million and
as high as $699.8 million for 2021. The 2021 lower and upper bounds range -2.5% to +2.5% relative
to the medium forecast. The confidence bound widens in 2022 with greater uncertainty. The 2022
upper- and lower-bound estimates are -3.5% and +3.4% different than the medium baseline
forecast, showing greater uncertainty one year out. This shows that it is not impossible or unrealistic
that revenue could grow stronger over the next year relative to the medium forecast, as well as the
exposure to the downside risk posed by economic threats.

Quarterly Tax Revenue Forecasts
More detailed information on the forecasts is provided by the quarterly figures. Quarterly growth
was volatile in 2016, but proved much more stable in the years that followed (2017-2019). However,
volatility was unmatched in 2020. For the remainder of the short-term forecast (through 2022), yearover-year growth will range between 4.3% and 12.4%.

Figure 3

Medium-Term Forecasts
Summary: The BRD short-term forecasting model is extended to produce forecasts over the time
horizon through 2027. Using different assumptions about the future course of the national economy,
three alternative projections are derived from the same equation specifications. Under the baseline
scenario, which leverages the Baseline macroeconomic scenario from Moody’s Analytics, RTD total
tax revenues are projected to grow by 41% from the end of 2020 to 2027.
Two alternative scenarios produce variations in the short-term revenue forecast (1-3 years), but
growth rates generally converge in the medium term (7 years). An alternative scenario in which the
national economy experiences a stronger short-term growth pattern yields a 46.6% increase from
2020-2027. Under stronger economic conditions, this scenario out-produces the baseline scenario
nearly every year of the medium-term forecast. In the second alternative, in which the economy
grows more slowly in the short run, there is a 38.2% increase between 2020 and 2027, with slower
growth recorded in the first two years followed by faster growth in the remainder of the forecast. The

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

The BRD short-term forecasting model is adapted to produce forecasts over the medium-term
horizon through 2027. This time frame has been chosen to conform to the RTD investment planning
horizon for FasTracks. The specifications of the equations for these medium-term forecasts are the
same as for the short-term model, and these are also estimated with monthly data.
Over any medium-term period, the U.S. economy can be subjected to shocks producing outcomes
that are difficult to anticipate. One reasonable way to present forecasts that incorporate the
uncertainty about future policy or unpredictable economic shocks is to develop results for
alternative scenarios. In addition to a baseline case, two alternative outcomes are presented: one
allowing for stronger growth than the selected baseline and the other assuming generally slower
economic growth. As an alternative method of incorporating uncertainty into the forecast, statisticsbased confidence bounds for the baseline scenario are also generated, producing high- and lowforecast bounds based on 67% confidence intervals.

Baseline Sales and Use Tax Revenue Forecasts
The Baseline RTD forecast is based on macroeconomic conditions described by Moody’s Analytics in
the “Baseline Forecast”. Moody’s Baseline Forecast is constructed with a 50% probability that the
U.S. economy will perform better and a 50% probability that it will underperform. This scenario
assumes that COVID-19 cases has peaked, and the U.S. reaches herd immunity by September. The
Fed commits to keeping interest rates low into 2023, and the latest round of Federal stimulus that
helps households and businesses is built into this national forecast. Downside risks to this forecast
include another spike in COVID cases that lead to another round of temporary business closures and
delayed or suspended round of economic stimulus. Upside potential includes faster-than-expected
herd immunity, and higher savings that supports potential consumer spending.
Real GDP grows 4.9% in 2021 and 5.2% in 2022; the average through the medium-term forecast is
3.1%. The unemployment rate improves to 6.1% in 2021 and falls well below 5% in 2023. Retail sales
increase moderately through the medium term.

differences in the cumulative revenue from 2020 to 2027 illustrate the impact of slower and faster
growth in the short run. The optimistic scenario produces cumulative (2020-2027) revenue $176
million above the baseline scenario, and the pessimistic scenario produces cumulative revenue $120
million below the baseline scenario. These alternative scenarios allow for a reasonable degree of
uncertainty about possible outcomes for the U.S. economy and may be taken as plausible bounds on
RTD revenue growth over the medium-term period.

in 2021 and surpasses the prior peak in 2022. With new government stimulus, rebounding
employment and wage and salary earnings, retail sales continue to advance.

As an alternative approach to incorporating economic uncertainty into the forecasts, the next
section describes two scenarios that examine the implications of potentially divergent shocks to the
national economy—one positive and one negative—for district taxable sales and RTD tax revenues.

Optimistic Scenario
Moody’s “Alternative Scenario 1 – Upside – 10th Percentile” represents a more optimistic outcome
over the coming four years compared with the Baseline Forecast. In this scenario, there is a decrease
in COVID-19 cases in the short-term, there is another round of federal stimulus, consumer and
business optimism rises (partially on optimism about a vaccine), consumers return to retail and
travel sooner than expected, and the labor market improves.
Real GDP grows strongly in 2021 (5.9%) and 2022 (6.4%) before moderating. The unemployment rate
quickly improves, and retail sales post strong growth.

In this optimistic scenario, total RTD tax revenues reach $927.5 million in 2027, which is 4% above
the medium forecast under the baseline scenario. This scenario yields revenue growth rates faster
than the baseline projections through 2026; 2027 growth is the same as the baseline rate of growth.
Total revenues grow by 46.6% between 2020 and 2027. Cumulative revenues from 2020-2027 are

Pessimistic Scenario
Moody’s “Alternative Scenario 2 – Downside – 75th Percentile” is constructed with a 75% probability
that the U.S. economy will perform better and a 25% probability that it will underperform. This
slower-growth scenario is caused by persistently high COVID cases, a slow rollout/adoption of the
vaccine, and a smaller-than-expected stimulus package. Consumer confidence and consumer
spending both are negatively impacted, as is spending on business and leisure travel.

Summary across the Three Scenarios
RTD revenues rebound in 2021 across all three scenarios. In the baseline scenario, revenue grows
41% to $891.8 million in the medium term (2020-2027). The pessimistic scenario presents slower
growth early in the forecast horizon, followed by faster growth, growing to $874.4 million by 2027,
netting 38.2% growth over the period. The optimistic scenario records growth that results in an
increase of 46.6% over the period, to $927.5 million, with outperforming growth among the
scenarios early in the forecast horizon.
The timing of future revenue changes differs across the three scenarios. This difference reveals how
revenues may shift, but they eventually end up relatively close to each other. The difference in total
RTD revenues between the pessimistic and optimistic scenarios is 6.1% in 2027, but the cumulative
revenue differences are 5.5% between the pessimistic and optimistic scenarios.

The baseline scenario presents the BRD’s most likely forecast for RTD tax revenues over the years
2020−2027. After 2020, revenue grows steadily during this period, achieving an overall increase of
41% between 2020 and 2027, to $891.8 million in 2027.

Long-Term Forecasts
The BRD long-term forecasting model incorporates age shares of the population as a key factor
influencing the rate of growth in real output and in state and district sales that determine RTD sales
and use tax revenues. This model projects annual growth rates in real RTD tax revenues to 2050.
Forecast summary information is presented in both constant (real) and current (nominal) terms.
Synopsis: Coming off a substantially lower base for 2020, the March 2021 long-term forecast reflects
moderate growth in the first 10 years of the forecast horizon, slowing in the final decade. Over the
entire 30-year period, RTD’s total tax revenues in nominal (current dollar) terms are projected to
grow by 3.2% per year on average, while the real (inflation adjusted) growth rate is 0.9%.
This forecast is for three decades: 2021–2030, 2031–2040, and 2041–2050.
National Economic and Demographic Trends
Growth in real output (GDP) is positively related to the proportion of the population that is upper
middle age (30–49 and 50–64) as this group contributes highly productive workers to the labor force
due to their experience and training. Although population shares change slowly, over the period
2010–2030 the proportion of the population in this productive age group is projected to decline,
from 46.2% to 43.4%, contributing to a slowing rate of growth in real output between now and 2030.
The prime population proportion then increases to 44% by 2050.

Summary of Three Scenarios

1.C.2.b
RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

In addition to a slowing of total U.S. population growth over the next three decades, the differing
growth rates of key age groups will have negative effects on economic growth. Growth rates of the
most productive age group (30–64), as well as the total population, will be slower during the next
three decades compared with the previous 10-year period (Table 22), producing some slowing in the
rate of growth in output. Across the three decades of the forecast period, growth in real GDP slows
considerably during the final decade compared with the periods from 2021–2030 and from 2031–
2040. (See the BRD forecast in Table 23; the Moody’s projections are presented only for comparison
with the BRD forecasts and do not play a role in the long-term BRD projections of any real variables
after 2027.) Growth in the current decade was distorted by the negative impact of the COVID-19
pandemic on the economy, and the strong growth that should follow in the recovery (although from
a markedly lower 2020 base). The demographic drag dampens growth in the final two decades of the
forecast horizon, partially offsetting the positive influences of increases in productivity and human
and physical capital that account for the long-run trend in GDP growth. During the final 10 years, the
share of the productive age group stabilizes, but the total population growth rate continues to
decline. The net effect of these demographic changes is a further decline in the real GDP growth rate
into the final decade of the forecast.

The BRD’s projected rate of growth in real GDP from 2021–2030 and from 2031-2040 are slightly
below Moody’s growth during the two decades, and notably slower in the last 10 years (2041–2050).
Over the 30-year forecast period, the BRD model projects 1.3% average growth and the Moody’s
model projects 2.2% average growth. The BRD forecast of retail sales growth is below Moody’s for
the forecast horizon.
Growth in U.S. retail sales is driven first by growth in output, which is then moderated by
demographic forces. The BRD forecasts show sluggish growth in retail sales during the last two
decades of the forecast (Table 24 reports rates of growth in real, inflation-adjusted terms).
Both Moody’s and BRD forecast modest growth rates in each of the three forward-looking decades.
Notably, retail sales grow at a slower pace than GDP.

Colorado and District Retail Sales, Taxable Sales, and RTD Sales and Use Tax Revenues
Following the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on the economy early in the current decade, growth
rebounds for retail sales and taxable sales at the state and district levels. Over the long term, the
national economic environment is reflected in the Colorado forecast. The combined influence of
national economic forces and changing demographics leaves the state and the district with quite low
rates of growth in sales and taxable sales during the final decade of the forecast as shown in the
following tables and figures.
Colorado retail sales growth over the next three decades is slightly higher than for the nation.
Colorado taxable sales and RTD taxable sales also tend to outperform national retail sales growth
(with the exception of RTD taxable sales in the final decade). The very low growth rates for RTD
taxable sales during the final decade reflects the persistent slowdown in total population growth in
Colorado, and especially in the district.

This long-term forecast ends in 2050. During this period, retail activity faces demographic drag in the
state. The long-term average real growth rate for RTD taxable sales is 0.9%, reflecting the slow longterm (30-year) growth.
Looking at nominal growth rates in RTD taxable sales shown in Table 25, the decade from 2021-2030
and the following decade are expected to produce growth of 4% and 3%, respectively. The pattern of
growth rates in Colorado taxable sales and RTD taxable sales are both consistent with that of retail
sales growth, with average growth rates for the last decade of the forecast being the weakest for all
three sales variables. These rates of growth for nominal sales appear in the next table and figure.

Future RTD sales tax revenues are forecasted by multiplying the effective rate of taxation by the
district taxable sales forecasts. Assuming no further changes in the RTD effective tax rate beyond
those implied by the reinstatement of the vendor allowance, the rates of growth in RTD sales tax
revenues for 2016 and beyond are identical to those of district taxable sales. Since the use tax base
is not directly observable, it is still necessary to estimate an equation to forecast RTD use tax
revenues. In this equation, RTD use tax revenues are driven by Colorado use tax revenues and
indirectly by the value of single family residential building permits. Revenue forecasts in real and
nominal terms over the next three decades are summarized in the following tables and charts and in
Appendix A.

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

Actual RTD sales and use tax data are now available through December 2020, allowing for error
evaluation through Q4 2020. For the short-term forecast, the BRD estimates have been above the
actual revenue 73 times and below the actual revenue 84 times, and a simple average of the error
has been -0.8%, with a 4.4% standard deviation (including the rapid revenue swings during the
pandemic recession). The September 2020 forecast for Q3 and Q4 2020 were low by 2.8% and 4.1%,
respectively, illustrating the rapid recovery of revenue in the second half of 2020. The short-term
and medium-term forecasts were revised upward in March 2021, coinciding with optimism about a
primed economic recovery—expectations for GDP, retail sales, employment, and personal income
improved. The average 30-year forecast growth rate in nominal dollars ending in 2050 is 0.2
percentage points lower than the September forecast.

1.C.2.b
RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

Three models have been developed and estimated for forecasting RTD sales and use tax revenues at
the short term (2022-2022), medium term (2027), and long term (2050). All three models consist of
dynamic equations that link RTD district retail sales and sales and use tax revenues to underlying
national and state economic indicators. Forecasts of the national indicators that are needed to drive
the state and district forecasts come from Moody’s Analytics. Population projections that enter the
equations of the long-term model come from Moody’s Analytics and the Colorado Demography
Office. Colorado economy forecasts are derived from updated specifications of the Colorado
Economy Model that was originally developed by members of the BRD team for the Office of State
Planning and Budgeting.

Key Econometric Concepts
The equations of the RTD forecast model rely on modern techniques of econometric time series
analysis. Each equation specifies a dynamic relationship between two or more variables, capturing
both a long-run equilibrium relation and short-run dynamic adjustments toward this equilibrium.
Such equations are called error correction models (ECMs) and are a type of vector autoregression
(VAR) model. Following time series analysis traditions, these equations may embody complex
dynamic behavior that is based on rigorous examination of historical patterns in the data. Unlike
univariate (ARIMA) methods, which are sophisticated representations of trends and cycles, VAR
models include explanatory variables in each equation to allow persistent departures from trends
and possible turning points.
In the error correction model, a long-run equilibrium relation is joined with a short-run dynamic
adjustment mechanism. The long-run relation is called the cointegrating equation, which captures
the common trends in the variables of interest. For example, district taxable sales and state retail
sales are expected to move together as a result of common underlying economic processes; they are
therefore referred to as “cointegrated” variables. Naturally, one will observe short-run departures
from this common pattern, but with a tendency for one variable to adjust back toward the
equilibrium relation. For example, the district economy may lag behind changes in the Colorado
economy, but departures from the common trends governing these two variables will vanish within
several months. These dynamic adjustments back toward the equilibrium relation are captured by
the ECM.
This framework is illustrated with a simplified version of the relation between district taxable sales
(TXBLSALES_RTD) and retail sales of Colorado (TRDR_TTL).
DLOG(TXBLSALES_RTD) = - 0.205*LOG(TXBLSALES_RTD(-1)) + 0.210*LOG(TRDR_TTL(-1)) 0.512*DLOG(TXBLSALES_RTD(-1)) + 0.741*DLOG(TRDR_TTL) + 0.403*DLOG(TRDR_TTL(-1)) 0.034*LOG(CPIUUS_GAS(-1)/CPIUUS_TTL(-1)) - 0.03745*@SEAS(1) + 0.040*@SEAS(5) 0.033*@SEAS(7) +4.125
Here DLOG( ) transforms any variable into its rate of change, so that the left hand side term is
interpreted as the rate of change in RTD taxable sales. Looking at the first two terms on the right
hand side, one sees that RTD taxable sales respond negatively to the level of taxable sales in the

Appendix A: Models for the Three Forecast Horizons

1.C.2.b
RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

A more complex adjustment back toward equilibrium is embodied in the following three terms on
the right hand side of the equation (- 0.512*DLOG(TXBLSALES_RTD(-1)) + 0.741*DLOG(TRDR_TTL) +
0.403*DLOG(TRDR_TTL(-1)). Past rates of change in RTD taxable sales and current plus past changes
in Colorado retail trade also impact the rate of adjustment in RTD taxable sales in the current period.
Additional independent variables, such as the price of gasoline (- 0.034*LOG(CPIUUS_GAS(1)/CPIUUS_TTL(-1)), can also be included in error correction equations, and this specification also
contains three seasonal dummy variables and a constant term.
This particular specification of lags and differences is the result of experimenting with various
alternatives and selecting the equation that meets standard diagnostic criteria, such as uncorrelated
residuals and statistically significant coefficients. For example, it is natural to allow all 12 months to
enter into the equation as seasonal variables, but only 3 of these were found to have statistically
significant effects. Similar cointegrating equations and ECMs are developed for the other key
variables in the RTD forecast model.
Since the ECM is expressed in rates of change, this is the natural form in which the forecasts of
district taxable sales can be generated. Given historical and forecasted values of all right-hand side
variables, the ECM produces forecasts of district taxable sales based on the forecasted month-tomonth changes.
Econometrics explicitly allows for random errors in the equations and in the estimation of their
coefficients. These sources of error will be reflected in the model’s forecasts, and the resulting
uncertainty can be estimated through simulation methods. This uncertainty is presented in the form
of interval forecasts given by the model’s mean forecast plus and minus one standard deviation of
the forecast error. The upper and lower bounds of these 67% confidence interval forecasts provide
statistically based high and low forecasts for each time period within the forecast horizon.

Comparisons and Linkages between the Three Models
All three models are grounded in the cointegration and ECM methodology, and all three generate
statistically based interval forecasts of RTD sales and use tax revenues. The short-term and mediumterm models are estimated using monthly data and produce forecasts at that same frequency. These
monthly forecasts of sales and use tax revenues are then aggregated to quarterly series for the
short-term forecasts and to annual data for the medium term.
The specifications of individual equations in the short-term and medium-term models are the same,
and therefore the baseline forecasts over a one-year horizon are identical. Variables and forecasts in
these two models are expressed in nominal values.
In order to forecast district level variables (e.g., RTD taxable sales, use tax revenues), it is necessary
to model and forecast economic variables at the state level. The Colorado Economy Model

previous period and positively to the previous period’s level of Colorado retail trade. These two
terms capture the error correction mechanism: if RTD taxable sales are too high relative to the level
of Colorado retail trade, then TXBLSALES_RTD will tend to decline in the following period. In this
situation the relation between RTD taxable sales and Colorado retail sales is out of equilibrium,
requiring future adjustments to restore equilibrium between these two cointegrated variables.

1.C.2.b
RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

previously developed for OSPB provides the framework for predicting state economic variables, such
as Colorado retail trade and Colorado taxable sales. These key Colorado variables are driven by
corresponding national variables and related state series, such as personal income. The linkages
between the economic variables at the national, state, and district level are shown in the following
figure:
Figure 9

The primary drivers from the national economy are personal income, employment, and retail sales,
and these contribute to the determination of Colorado retail sales and, in turn, RTD taxable sales.
Given the effective rate of sales taxation, RTD sales tax revenues are then given by a simple algebraic
identity.
Recognizing that large shocks to the national economy are likely to occur at some time over the
seven-year forecast horizon, the possibility of such shocks is incorporated in the medium-term
forecast by the use of two alternative national economic scenarios from Moody’s Analytics. These
alternative scenarios allow for the possibility of faster economic growth in the near term in one case
and for slower long-term growth in the other. These scenarios also provide alternative bounds that
complement the statistically based lower-bound forecasts from the econometric model.
The long-term model equations are fundamentally different from those of the other models, and are
designed to capture gradual structural adjustments in the economy due to changing demographics.
This model relies on population projections from Moody’s Analytics and from the Colorado State
Demography Office to drive the forecasts of all real national economic variables, state and district
retail sales and taxable sales, and therefore RTD sales and use tax revenues. Whereas Moody’s
forecasts of national economic indicators are used to drive the short-term and medium-term
Colorado Economy Model forecasts, BRD researchers have developed equations for key national
variables for the long-term forecasts. Only Moody’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) forecast is used for
converting forecasts of real variables into nominal values in the long-term forecasts.

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

However, market disruptions and supply-chain discord associated with current events creates
additional risk that the CPI can be adjusted upward, potentially sharply, in the coming 24
months. Currently, however, there is no clear evidence of nationwide inflationary pressure. When
asked about prospects for inflation on March 4th, 2021, Chairman Jerome Powell suggested that
inflation will increase this year, but that it would prove to be temporary.
A combination of factors that may cause higher inflation within the next 12-24 months include:
•

Excess savings by households who remained employed during the pandemic (approximately
80% of workers). As the economy reopens, most households are expected to boost
spending well above historical averages. This abnormally high spending can create demandpull inflation.

•

High commodity prices. Several staple commodities, such as copper, lumber, and wheat are
priced near all-time highs. This causes potential cost-push inflation. Such effects are
currently seen in home-construction costs.

•

Sudden tightening of labor markets. As the economy reopens, labor markets are expected
to tighten, leading to wage growth. Wage growth is considered to be the largest contributor
to inflation.

The RTD forecast model currently incorporates annual US inflation that rises to 2.6% by 2022, with
Denver metro area inflation above 3% by 2023. The BRD team will continue to monitor the situation
and may adjust expected inflation when sufficient evidence emerges to suggest changing inflation
expectations.

The Input Data—Sources and Description
This section describes the data used to estimate equations and generate forecasts from the three
models. There are three levels of data: national variables, Colorado data, and district (RTD) data.
National Statistics and Forecasts: National data, such as U.S. retail sales and U.S. GDP figures, track
closely to state indicators. Typically, higher U.S. retail sales indicate higher retail sales in Colorado.
National statistics for GDP and retail sales are published frequently, and several forecasts for these
indicators are available. The Colorado Economy Model that drives the district level variables relies on
these national variables to forecast corresponding state variables.
Some key national indicators are:
•

U.S. Retail Sales: Obviously, this indicator tracks closely to Colorado’s retail sales. This
indicator, along with its forecasted levels, is a central part of the Colorado Economy Model
and the RTD district model.

Higher inflation could have an impact on the RTD forecast. Currently, the real-dollar RTD forecast is
constructed as nominal dollars adjusted to the Consumer Price Index (CPI). For most of the previous
decade, the CPI has been low – between 0.5% and 2.0% annually.

1.C.2.b

The figure below shows the relationship between U.S. retail sales and Colorado retail sales
over the past two decades. The Colorado sales values are not seasonally adjusted (the U.S.
figures are), but the two series are clearly closely related. The data have been standardized
to show the common movement of the two variables. U.S. retail sales change direction at
the same time as Colorado retail trade. It can also be seen that, over time, the overall level
of trade trends diverge slightly for these two series. In 2000 through 2006, U.S. retail sales
were, for the most part, greater than Colorado sales, but from 2009 to 2020 the opposite
was true. This implies that U.S. retail sales were growing more slowly than Colorado sales
over the past 15 years.
Figure 10

•

National Income: U.S. GDP, personal income, and disposable income serve as common
indicators for the state of the national economy. U.S. GDP plays a key role in the long-term
model. U.S. personal income is a predictor of Colorado personal income, which enters into
the equation for Colorado retail trade.

•

Consumer Price Index and Components: In forecasting sales and use tax revenues, it is vital
to distinguish between taxable and nontaxable expenditures and to consider how the
composition of household expenditures changes over time. In the short run, the proportion
of expenditures going to taxable items can vary with changes in the relative prices of goods
and services that are tax exempt. Gasoline prices are one example of a CPI component that
fluctuates dramatically, affecting the share of taxable/nontaxable retail sales. This variable
is included in the current specification of some equations in the forecasting model. The CPI
is also used to convert between nominal and real values of personal income and retail sales.

•

Population by Age: In the long-term model, the age distribution of the population plays an
important role in the forecasts of retail sales and taxable sales. For example, the rate of
growth in the prime working-age population of the United States is used in the equation for
national GDP. Population projections come from Moody’s Analytics.

Regional Economic Variables: The equations in the forecasting model are based on basic
relationships between corresponding variables at national, state, and district levels. National data,
such as U.S. retail sales and U.S. personal income, track closely to local indicators. While national

Colorado and Denver Metro Personal Income: Total wages are obtained on a quarterly basis
by industry (or aggregated) and by county from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (not seasonally
adjusted). This information is posted online with a six-month time lag. The data source is the
Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW). Because the survey only asks for total
wages disbursed for the quarter, and not for the month, we cannot see an alternative
method for obtaining monthly data by county. This survey solicits information from the
employer’s location, not from the employees’ residence, so some wages leak out of the
Denver Metro region. Personal income data for the state of Colorado are sourced from the
Bureau of Labor Statistics on a quarterly basis. (Data sources: Bureau of Labor Statistics,
www.bls.gov; Bureau of Economic Analysis, www.BEA.gov)

•

State and District Populations by Age Group: In the long-term model, retail sales and taxable
sales at state and local levels are affected by the age distribution of the relevant population.
Data on population by age groups come from the U.S. Census Bureau’s U.S. Population
Projections and Population Estimates, and the Colorado State Demography Office in the
Colorado Department of Local Affairs.

•

Colorado and Denver Metro Employment: Employment by industry and metropolitan area is
from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Current Employment Statistics (CES) is a survey of
employers and is available monthly, with a one- to two-month lag. These numbers are
revised as the QCEW data become available. If county-level data are necessary, the QCEW
employment data are available, but lag six months.

•

Taxable and Total Retail Sales and Tax Revenue Data: The Colorado Department of Revenue
(DOR) is the primary source for taxable sales, sales tax revenues, and use tax revenues. From
the collection of sales tax revenues each month and the knowledge of the effective rate of
taxation, the department computes the value of taxable sales (revenues divided by the tax
rate). At the state level, this procedure produces data on sales tax revenues and taxable
sales that are entirely consistent. However, the DOR computes taxable sales based on the
tax laws that apply to state sales tax collections, and these laws previously differed in their
treatment of RTD tax collections. In 2014, HB 13-1272 effectively changed the RTD base to
be the same as the state tax base.
We apply the same DOR data construction procedure to compute RTD taxable sales. Sales
tax revenues collected by RTD are divided by the RTD effective rate of taxation to produce
RTD taxable sales. In addition to providing consistency between the taxable sales and
revenues data, this procedure allows future changes in RTD tax rates to be incorporated
(e.g., anticipated changes in the vendor allowance).
Forecasts of district taxable sales are driven by equations that relate this variable to
Colorado retail trade (taxable and nontaxable). This, in turn, is linked to U.S. retail sales.

level retail trade sales are a reliable indicator of general trends in Colorado retail sales, the inclusion
of state-specific economic variables, such as Colorado personal income, can improve the explanatory
and forecasting power of the model.

1.C.2.b
RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

Most long-term economic forecasting exercises employ a production function framework to project
real output (GDP). With this approach, output is a function of labor supply, capital stock, and
technology. From projections of these three determinants, predicting output is straightforward.
However, forecasting these three inputs is a daunting task that is often handled with arbitrary
assumptions about their long-run growth rates. There is little reason to believe that projections of
the growth rates in the three inputs would produce more reliable forecasts than directly projecting
output.
However, the BRD long-term forecasting model borrows some useful elements from this framework.
Modeling real output growth for the national economy is the starting point of the BRD forecasting
model, and all other variables in the BRD model are also expressed in real (inflation-adjusted) terms.
This puts aside the task of forecasting inflation, which depends on national political issues, Federal
Reserve behavior, and changes in global resource prices. Since inflation rates can be expected to
impact RTD revenues and costs symmetrically, incorporating inflation into the analysis is an
unnecessary complication.
Although the BRD model does not estimate a production function or make assumptions about the
long-run growth in inputs, a production relation implicitly underpins the framework. The growth in a
nation’s labor force, capital stock, and technology is affected by the age distribution of the
population. Substantial theoretical and empirical literature on the “demographic dividend”
establishes the impact that age distribution has on economic growth, working through the three
determinants of real output.1 The use of the age distribution of the population in forecasting longterm economic growth in general, and RTD tax revenues in particular, has several important
advantages:
•

•

•

Sound economic theory and empirical evidence supports the existence of a stable, predictive
relation between output and age structure. Output growth is positively related to the
working age share of the population, according to the aggregate production relation, and it
is negatively related to the dependency ratio, according to life cycle models of saving.
The age structure of the population is predictable with reasonable accuracy, and projections
are provided by the Social Security Administration and published by the Census Bureau.
Underlying demographic processes (fertility rates, mortality rates, immigration) change
slowly over time, allowing accurate age-specific population projections. Furthermore, older
portions of the age distribution of the population can be projected with great accuracy
because for the next 30 years, the population over the age of 30 depends only on mortality
rates and immigration—the former being highly predictable.
In terms of the production function framework, the age distribution can impact output
through each of the three inputs. By affecting the savings rate, age structure influences real
business investment and the growth in capital stock. One form of investment is in R&D,

which contributes to productivity growth. In addition, new physical investment embodies
latest technologies, thereby contributing to productivity growth. The labor force is obviously
directly related to the age structure through the size of the working age population. Also,
experienced workers tend to be more productive than new entrants to the labor force, so an
older workforce shows higher output per worker.
The ultimate goal is to forecast (taxable) retail sales, not output. Given the equivalence of
output and income, a simple consumption function links retail sales to output or,
equivalently, to gross national income. However, the relation between aggregate
consumption and aggregate income is expected to vary over time with changes in the age
structure of the population. Therefore, the equation for (national) retail sales includes the
population age shares, as well as aggregate income.
By the same reasoning, the age distribution affects the relation between total retail sales
(the model’s key national variable) and taxable sales (the relevant state and district
variables). For example, the consumption pattern of people 65 and older shows a higher
proportion of spending on nontaxable items compared with younger individuals who spend
more on taxable goods as they establish new households.

The BRD model employs this framework to produce long-term forecasts over the period ending
2050. Business cycle fluctuations come into play only during the current decade as the economy
gradually moves toward capacity output. These business cycle fluctuations play a role in the
medium-term forecasts previously developed for RTD, and the forecasts presented here build on
these 2020–2026 forecasts. The short-term and medium-term forecasts presented in the earlier
sections of this report employ nominal (current dollar) values of all variables, while the long-term
analysis is based on real variables. Both real (inflation adjusted) and nominal forecasts of total RTD
revenues are presented in this section of the report to allow comparisons with other forecasts and
to permit either real or nominal budgetary analysis. The data presented through the end of 2020 are
historical observations, while data from 2021 to 2050 represent forecasts.
The equations of the long-term BRD model employ the same dynamic error correction/cointegration
framework as the short- and medium-term models. All variables in these equations are expressed in
real terms, and projected real variables from the equations are converted to nominal values using
Moody’s forecasted national CPI. Both real and nominal values are presented in the tables and
charts of this section.
National output growth is determined by population shares as indicated by the previous discussion.
National retail sales growth is driven by output growth, moderated by changes in age shares of the
population. State and district sales and taxable sales are similarly related to national and state sales,
as well as state and district population shares. State and district sales growth rates, in turn,
determine the growth in RTD sales and use tax revenues.
National retail sales and Colorado personal income are key factors driving Colorado retail sales in the
long-term forecasting model. But differences in population growth rates and age distribution for the
nation, the state, and the district affect the relations between sales at the three geographical levels.
The growth rate of Colorado’s working-age population, for example, affects personal income growth
in the state, which in turn feeds into the determination of Colorado retail sales. Slowing growth of

Population forecasts are sourced from the Office of the Colorado State Demographer and from
Moody’s Analytics. Colorado population forecast revisions by age and by county were released in
late 2020, and showed slower net migration to the state and the district (note: new Colorado and
district population estimates and projections will be released in October 2021).
Overall, population growth in Colorado and in the district affects the growth in sales and therefore in
sales tax revenues. While total U.S. population growth declines steadily over the three decades of
the long-term forecast, the state and the district exhibit somewhat different patterns in expected
growth rates as shown in the following figure. The estimated population growth rate for the district
and for the state peaked in 2015, followed by a decade of rather flat growth rates, and then began a
long period of decline. If birth rates increase, or the state experiences stronger net immigration, the
trend may be altered somewhat.
Figure 11

In addition to variations in the rate of total population growth, the changing population age
structure also affects the growth rates of sales and tax revenues in the long-term projections. For
Colorado and the district, the proportion of those in the prime working-age group and those in the
youngest age group (0 to 29 years of age) are projected to decline throughout most of the forecast
period, while the share of the aging population will grow. These trends will adversely impact total
and taxable sales in the state and the district.

this prime working-age population therefore indirectly contributes to the declining growth in
Colorado retail sales, Colorado taxable sales, and therefore RTD taxable sales. On the other hand,
moderate growth in the total population of the state adds to the growth in Colorado taxable sales,
offsetting to some extent the adverse effects of changing population age shares on the other sales
and tax revenue variables.

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

Since budget planning more commonly employs nominal (current dollar) values, the inflationadjusted (real) forecasts are converted to current dollars using Moody’s Analytics annual forecasts of
the national CPI for urban households. This adjustment with the national CPI is consistent with the
conversions to real values used throughout the BRD long-term modeling project. Although local CPI
data are available, these may be less reliable than the national data due to smaller samples in the
price surveys.

Appendix C: A Qualitative Assessment of Colorado’s Economy

Summary: The U.S. and Colorado economies experienced significant contractions as a result of the
coronavirus pandemic. Both the U.S. and Colorado observed significant declines in GDP, employment,
and wage and salary income; and record increases in jobless claims and unemployment. After
decreasing 6.3% year-over-year in Q2 2020, Colorado real GDP began to rebound, but remained
down 1.4% year-over-year in Q3 2020 (5th-best nationally). Colorado lost 342,700 jobs from February
through April 2020 (-12.2%). The state added back 191,500 jobs by December, but remained down
5.4% from peak, ranking Colorado 26th for employment growth. Additionally, the state’s
unemployment rate increased from the 3rd-lowest nationally early in 2020 to the 36th-highest by yearend, illustrating the destructive impact of the recession on Colorado’s labor market.
COVID-19
The United States had the highest number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the world as of March
2021. While Colorado has the 21st-largest population in the United States, the state recorded the
22nd-highest number of cases, and the 26th-highest number of deaths.

Confidence
The Consumer Confidence from the Conference Board recorded an increase in Consumer Confidence
for January 2021, up from a six-year low in April after increasing through November and falling in
December. The Mountain Region often exceeds the national index, though it dipped below the
national reading in June, July, and September 2020, and is above the national reading for January.
The Mountain Region index is far removed from its recent peak in September 2018.

This qualitative assessment of the U.S. and Colorado economies is intended to serve as context for
the RTD sales and use tax forecast. In the process of compiling an annual business and economic
outlook for Colorado, the BRD has developed local indicators that can be used to complement the
results from the econometric models.

1.C.2.b
RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

The Leeds Business Confidence Index (LBCI), a forward-looking index of economic and industry
growth expectations, revealed that Colorado business leaders’ confidence improved ahead of Q1
and Q2 2021 from the record low observed last year. An index reading above 50 indicates positive
expectations. Ahead of Q1 2021, the index increased to 47.9, and improved further ahead of Q2 to
59.5. State expectations decreased slightly to 46.9, a 2-point decrease from Q4 2020. Looking further
ahead to Q2 2021, state and national expectations were more optimistic, with both state and
national expectations rebounding above 50.

Gross Domestic Product
Real GDP increased at seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) of 4.1% nationally in Q4 2020
following a record decrease in GDP during Q2 and a rebound in Q3 as the effects of the COVID-19
pandemic became evident in economic data. Personal consumption expenditures were up 2.4% on
account of a 4% increase in services, while durable goods declined 0.6% and nondurables shrank
1.1%. Gross private fixed investment rose 26.5%, government consumption fell 1.1%, and the trade
deficit widened. GDP is expected to grow in 2021; according to Consensus Forecasts, Q1 is projected

to grow (annualized) by 4.8%, Q2 7.6%, and Q3 7%, before tapering off to 4.6% growth by Q4. GDP
growth in 2021 stands to be the fastest in decades.
In Q3 2020 (newest available data), Colorado’s real GDP decreased 1.4% year-over-year but grew at
an annualized rate of 30.1% from Q2 2020 to Q3 2020. Nationally, Colorado ranked 5th in year-overyear growth.

Jobless Claims
Initial jobless claims illustrate the immediate and profound impact of the pandemic on employment.
While initial filings in the United States are well below the record highs observed in March and April,
claims improved to 712,000 the week ending March 6, 2021. The average for the year leading up to
the crisis was 217,000 per month. Colorado recorded 863,000 initial claims from the week ending
March 21, 2020 to the week ending March 6, 2021, averaging 16,900 per week, compared to an
average of 1,900 per week in 2019.

Employment and Wages
For the 12 months ending in January 2021, the United States lost 800,250 jobs per month, on
average. In March, the U.S. lost 1.3 million jobs, followed by a record 20.8 million in April—the
largest one-month decline since the Bureau of Labor Statistics began collecting data in 1948. The
U.S. added back 12.9 million jobs from May 2020 through February 2021 but remained down 6.2%
from the prior peak.

Colorado lost 16,500 jobs in March 2020 and a record 325,800 jobs in April, before adding back a
combined 120,500 jobs in May through December, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The
majority of the employment rebound was observed in May and June (128,000 jobs); gains continued
through October before losses in November (-4,700 jobs) and December (-20,300 jobs) on account of
surging cases and heightened restrictions in the winter months. The state added 5,100 jobs per
month on average during 2019. The combined Denver-Aurora-Lakewood and Boulder MSAs made
up 62.8% of non-farm employment in Colorado in December 2020.
Leading up to the pandemic, historically low unemployment rates in Colorado, especially in the
Denver Metro area, led to a shortage of skilled workers. Colorado unemployment hit a record low of
2.5% in October 2019 and has experienced a relatively continuous downward trend since the end of
the Great Recession. This decrease to a new record low occurred as both the labor force and
employment posted strong gains over the decade. The Boulder and Denver-Aurora-Lakewood MSAs
had record low unemployment rates of 2.0% and 2.3%, respectively, but have since increased to
6.9% and 8.5% in December 2020, respectively. Colorado’s unemployment rate increased to a record
12.2% in April 2020 and rests at 8.2% in December, ranking the state as having the 4th highest
unemployment rate in the nation. Nationwide, the unemployment rate rose to 6.8% in January
2021.
Industry employment gains in Colorado year-over-year in December 2020 were led by
Administrative Support and Waste Management (5,000); Finance and Insurance (3,000); and Trade,
Transportation, and Utilities (2,800). Employment in Colorado saw record declines in April with the

Leisure and Hospitality sector observing the largest month-over-month decline (-148,900), followed
by Education and Health Services (-44,000), and Trade, Transportation, and Utilities (-40,400).
However, these sectors have observed the largest employment rebound, with the Leisure and
Hospitality Sector gaining 74,700 jobs from April through December, followed by Trade,
Transportation, and Utilities (66,100) and Education and Health Services (33,800).

In Q3 2020, Colorado had the 17th-highest personal income in the nation, and the state ranked 12th
in per capita personal income, at $63,098. The U.S. average was $60,320. The state’s growth in per
capita personal income ranked 48th, at 2.7%. Over the past 10 years, Colorado per capita personal
income has remained higher than the national average.
Real Estate
The most recent data from the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) All Transactions Index show
that home prices in Colorado increased 5.8% year-over-year in Q4 2020 (26th-highest), signalling that
the COVID-19 pandemic has had little effect on the housing market. The Purchase-Only index
increased 10.7% year-over-year (27th).

The total value of construction is determined when permits are pulled rather than when activity is
put into place. Colorado recorded $19.5 billion in construction in 2020, a 3.6% increase year-overyear. Residential construction drove the growth, recording a 11.5% increase in 2020, while
nonresidential and nonbuilding construction fell.

National retail and food services sales increased 7.3% year-over-year and 5.3% month-over-month in

E-Commerce
Internet sales continue to outpace traditional brick-and-mortar sales. As technology advances
through tablets and mobile devices, consumers have greater ability to make digital purchases and
access the nation’s e-commerce landscape. The stay-at-home orders exacerbated the already-rapid
shift to online purchases, with large retailers such as Neiman Marcus and Barneys New York recently
declaring bankruptcy while retailers such as Amazon reporting record sales.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, e-commerce sales increased strongly year-over-year in Q2
(44.5%), Q3 (36.6%), and Q4 2020 (32.1%). However, sales declined quarter-over-quarter in Q3 and
Q4 (-1.1% and -1.2%, respectively) coming off the strong growth in Q2. The nation’s e-commerce
market continues to experience steady growth in its market share, making up 14% of total retail
sales in Q3 2020, up from 11.2% in Q3 2019.

Appendix D: Prolonged Recession Scenario

This scenario represents a 96% probability that the economy will perform better and a 4%
probability that it will perform worse. This protracted slump is caused by the COVID-19 pandemic
lasting longer than generally expected. In this scenario, the vaccine rollout goes slower than
expected, and resistant strains rise, causing the recovery to stall.
After real GDP fell 4.1% in 2020, GDP records a modest rebound in 2021 (1.1%) before retrenching,
falling 2% in 2022 followed by a moderate recovery. This prolonged recession has sustained,
detrimental impacts on the labor market, pushing unemployment rates past 10% in 2022 and 2023.
Retail sales decrease 5.5% nationally in 2022 before beginning to rebound.
Following the pandemic recession in 2020, RTD revenue posts gains in 2021, but falls with the
double-dip recession in 2022 (-2%). However, RTD revenue begins posting growth again in 2023,
ranging between 3.6% and 7.4% in the medium term horizon. Annual revenue does not surpass the
prior peak until 2023.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Funding Agreement - City of Boulder/HOP for 2021

Committee Meeting Date:
April 13, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
April 13, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO, or her designee, to execute all
documents necessary to enter into a Funding Agreement with the City of Boulder for financial support
for HOP circulator operations within the commercial areas of the City of Boulder, the University of
Colorado at Boulder and adjacent business and residential areas for calendar year 2021 for an amount
not to exceed $978,092.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Fred Worthen, Assistant General Manager, Bus Operations
Erin Vallejos, Manager, Competitive Services
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
The City of Boulder (Boulder) has supplemented RTD’s bus service within the City by providing circulator
bus service, known as the HOP, since October 1994. The HOP provides mobility and access to Boulder’s
commercial areas, the University of Colorado at Boulder, and adjacent business and residential
developments.
RTD provides extensive bus service to/from and within Boulder and has worked collectively with Boulder
staff to ensure that these services are attractive, effective and complementary for people living, visiting,
and working in the area. The HOP connects to many local and regional RTD bus routes, as well as with
the Downtown Boulder and Boulder Junction at Depot Square Stations.
In early 2020, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the HOP operated 10-minute frequencies during the day
and 15-minute frequencies at night and on weekdays; 15-minute frequencies during the day and 20minute frequencies on Saturday nights; and 15-minute frequencies during the day and 20-minute
frequencies Sunday nights and on holidays. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in
ridership declines, the HOP service was modified to a Saturday schedule on weekdays and on actual
Saturdays. This represents an approximate 20-25% reduction in service hours from pre-pandemic levels.
DISCUSSION
In January of 2021, RTD’s General Manager and CEO, members of her leadership team, as well as staff
met with Boulder and HOP staff to discuss the history and longstanding HOP partnership; the parties
continued commitment to supporting and enhancing the HOP service; and, the planning challenges faced
for the current year given the uncertainty of ridership and COVID-19 recovery. During the meeting
Boulder staff shared that the City’s Amended Budget Process begins in April and requested RTD’s
assistance with service planning and budget efforts for the remainder of 2021.
The agreement is for one year. The first portion of the agreement was executed under the General
Manager and CEO’s authority for the period of January 1 through March 31, 2021 for an amount not to

Packet Pg. 95

2.B.1

exceed $244,523.
The second portion of the agreement will be for April 1 through December 31, 2021, for an amount not
to exceed $733,569. RTD funding for HOP operations in 2021 is at 60% of the funding level agreed to
in 2020, which was $1,630,154.
From June 2020 through February 2021, HOP ridership has been approximately 468 daily boardings
which is a reduction of 78% from 2019 when daily ridership averaged 2,140 boardings. RTD and
Boulder staff are monitoring ridership regularly, especially as in-person learning resumes at the University
of Colorado Boulder Campus, and are working cooperatively to ensure that service levels can meet
demand. It is important to note, the City of Boulder reported that 65% of HOP ridership is directly linked
to the University of Colorado Boulder Campus.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
HOP operations funding was included in the approved 2021 Budget. Nothing herein obligates RTD to
renew or extend this Agreement.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
June 2021 Proposed Service Change

Committee Meeting Date:
April 13, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
April 13, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the June 2021 Service Changes and to authorize the General
Manager or her designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose
services are impacted by these changes.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Ford, Chief Operations Officer
Pauletta Tonilas, Assistant General Manager, Communications
Jessie Carter, Acting Senior Manager of Service Development
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 minutes
BACKGROUND
At the February 2, 2021 Communications and Government Relations Committee meeting, staff shared
with the Board of Directors the plan to launch an overarching enhanced approach to stakeholder
engagement throughout the District, as a continuous effort to foster open dialogue. This is an
opportunity for the Board and staff to hear directly from key stakeholders on RTD matters that matter
most to them. One aspect is conducting a round of stakeholder engagement sessions at the beginning of
each service change process to hear feedback from stakeholders about transit services in their
communities. The stakeholder listening phase is in addition to the public listening phase, which will
begin this month as part of the June service change process. Both the stakeholder feedback and the
public input will help inform RTD’s future service plans.
DISCUSSION
Transit ridership remains significantly lower than pre-COVID levels which is affected by a lack of
commuter activity based on remote working and learning practices that have been effectuated due to
health orders. Moreover, public health orders remain in a protective posture and the agency’s COVID-19
service plan levels are reflective of the current challenges facing the District.
While ridership remains relatively unchanged, a review of ridership at the route/line level does support
increases and adjustments to some route services showing higher levels of ridership. Additionally, transit
system maintenance to improve on-time performance and service reliability is needed on both bus and
rail services. The proposals herein, contain a mix of service enhancements and adjustments that address
transit system connectivity and contract compliance, while maintaining the necessary resource capacity
to support social distancing throughout the transit network.
It is intended that the service adjustments proposed to the current COVID-19 service plan be adopted as
further modification to the initial COVID-19 service plan implemented April 19, 2020 and modified in
January 2021. Many of the routes proposed for service improvements serve vulnerable communities that
are transit dependent. These customers often perform essential jobs and have continued to utilize RTD
services during the pandemic.

Packet Pg. 97

2.B.2

The Board adopted guidance for proposed service changes continue to be:
• Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
• The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
• The availability of alternative services to affected customers;
• Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
• Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also, disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
• Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
Given the current economic conditions due to the COVID-19 induced economic slowdown, the
overarching guidance for the proposed June 2021 service changes come from the Board adopted
guidance for COVID-19 Budget Reductions, especially Principle number three (3):
“We will prioritize mobility for people who must depend on transit during the pandemic: we will strive to
maximize mobility during the pandemic for those customers who most depend upon our services to
access essential jobs and their necessities, while also keeping our community activity centers
appropriately connected.”
SUMMARY OF PUBLIC HEARINGS
There were 3 public meetings conducted virtually via Microsoft Teams and Facebook Live between
March 30th and March 31st. Comments and further details from these meetings have been recorded and

Service Equity Analysis
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B Title VI Requirements and Guidelines
provides recipients receiving Federal financial assistance with directives for compliance with Title VI of
the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Executive Order 12898 regarding Environmental Justice. In this
Circular, the FTA requires RTD to evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that
exceed the established major service change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a
disproportionately adverse impact on minority or low-income populations.
Staff assessed the 35 proposed June 2021 service changes and the results indicate none of the changes
meet the major service change threshold. Therefore, a service equity analysis is not required per RTD’s
Title VI major service change policy.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The overall estimated financial impact contained in this proposal is designed to be cost neutral.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Safety Management System Quarterly Update

Committee Meeting Date:
April 13, 2021

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Mike Meader, Assistant General Manager, Safety, Security and Asset Management
Dan McClain, Senior Manager, Safety and Environmental
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
Federal regulations 49 CFR Part 674 State Safety Oversight (SSO) Program, administered by the
Colorado Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), and 49 CFR Part 673 Public Transportation Agency Safety
Plan (PTASP) mandate Rail Transit Agencies develop a PTASP based on a Safety Management System
(SMS) framework.
49 CFR Part 673 requires that RTD identify an Accountable Executive to ensure that the agency’s SMS
is effectively implemented throughout the agency’s public transportation system in compliance with the
State Safety Oversight Program. The Accountable Executive for RTD is the General Manager and CEO.
The CPUC State Safety Oversight Program states the RTD Board of Directors must approve the PTASP
annually prior to its submission to the CPUC. Furthermore, the SSO Program requires the Board receive
regular briefings on the SMS to ensure awareness of the agency’s safety performance and activities on
an ongoing basis.
DISCUSSION
The General Manager and CEO has directed the Chief Safety and Security Officer to provide a quarterly
presentation to the Board of Directors regarding the agency safety performance and status of the SMS
development. The quarterly update will include a discussion of the following:
•
•
•
•

Safety Performance Targets
Safety Performance
Current SMS projects
SMS Development and Review Roadmap

This Discussion Item includes a review of RTD’s 2020 safety performance and the first quarter 2021
safety performance across the agency.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
COVID-19 Title VI Service Equity Analysis

Committee Meeting Date:
April 13, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
April 13, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt the Title VI Service Equity Analysis report to comply with federal
laws, regulations and guidelines related to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Zamy Silva, Civil Rights Senior Manager
Jessie Carter II, Service Development Senior Manager (Acting)
Carl Green Jr., Transit Equity Manager
PRESENTATION LENGTH
30 minutes
BACKGROUND
On March 24, 2020, the Board of Directors approved adjustments to RTD services as a result of the
COVID-19 pandemic. RTD’s reduced service delivery plan was effectuated on April 19, 2020 and is
summarized in Attachment A.
RTD employed a well-reasoned, balanced, and equitable approach to determine how best to reduce
services based on the demand, while also serving regional needs and maintaining optimal service for
essential purposes. Priority was placed on preserving access to key activity centers, such as hospitals
and major health care providers, as well as major employment centers. Retaining service in low-income
and minority-populated areas was also important as more ridership were seen on those routes and lines
in those geographic areas in comparison to other areas.
Subsequently, the Board of Directors approved adjustments to RTD services in July 2020 for the
September 2020 Service Change Proposal (see, Appendix A of Attachment B) and October 2020 for the
January 2021 Service Change Proposal (see, Appendix A of Attachment B). With steep declines in
ridership (70% reduction) and an uncertain return to higher demand, service reductions enacted with the
January 2020 runboard are currently in place. Taking a holistic approach, RTD took reasonable measures
to implement service changes equitably dating back to the April 2020 COVID-19 related reductions
through the March 2021 service changes in order to prevent unintentional discrimination.
DISCUSSION
The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) published guidance on April 7, 2020 to provide clarity
regarding how COVID-19 preparations impact certain FTA requirements. The guidance details when a
Title VI service equity analysis must be performed for emergency service reductions and changes during
the pandemic. Specifically, if a transit agency chooses to make any temporary changes permanent, then
the transit agency is required to complete a service equity analysis to ensure the changes do not unfairly
impact minority and low-income populations. Of note, a permanent change is any service change lasting
longer than 12 months. The 12-month threshold will lapse April 19, 2021. Thus, an analysis is required
to be brought before the RTD Board of Directors for approval. The complete Title VI Service Equity
Analysis report is shown in Attachment B.

Packet Pg. 159

3.B.1

RTD’s Title VI Service Equity Analysis Policies
Per FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Major Service Change Policy, a Disparate
Impact Policy, and a Disproportionate Burden Policy. Collectively, these policies provide the foundational
requirements for evaluating service change proposals for equity. These policies and their applicable
thresholds are listed below:
Major Service Change Policy: A major service change is defined as a 25 percent addition or reduction in
the service hours of any route that would remain in effect for twelve (12) or more months. All major
service changes will be subject to an equity analysis.
Major Service Change Results: Changes to 103 existing bus route/patterns and rail lines in RTD’s
network of 167 services from April 2020 to April 2021 met the established thresholds for a major
service change. The following routes had service reductions or were eliminated:

Title VI Policies:
Disparate Impact Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a minority population 10
percent more than non-minority populations; this level of impact is considered a disparate impact.
Disproportionate Burden Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a low-income
population 10 percent more than higher-income populations; this level of impact is considered a
disproportionate burden. A low-income population is a group of households who are at or below 150
percent of the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.

Packet Pg. 160

3.B.1

Methodology:
Disparate impact and disproportionate burden analyses were performed at the route level, route block
group, and network level, to identify any potential disparities in service changes based on race/ethnicity
or income.
Summary of Findings:
• Of the 103 routes with major service changes or reductions, none had adverse impacts when
comparing the service reductions of equity populations with those of non-equity populations.
Low-income routes had a 13% lower reduction than higher income routes and minority routes had
12% less of a reduction than non-minority routes.
•

Of routes that were major service changes, 14 had potential disparate impact findings, and 27
had potential disproportionate burdens findings.

•

Of routes that were eliminated, 12 had potential disparate impact findings, and 38 had potential
disproportionate burdens findings.

•

Of new services or restructures, 7 routes had potential disparate impact findings, and 6 had
potential disproportionate burdens findings.

•

30 of 40 routes had smaller reductions in service than the corridor’s primary route, and all
eliminated routes had net corridor service changes that reflected a smaller reduction in service,
indicating the availability of other RTD services within one-quarter of mile of the corridor, on
average.

Conclusions:
Title VI concerns are minimal compared to the COVID-19 service reductions and subsequent service
changes in September 2020 and January 2021. Overall, the system-wide service reductions have
impacted equity groups moderately less compared to non-equity groups. However, because some of the
major service changes resulted in a potential disparate impact or a disproportionate burden they have
been identified for further examination and will be prioritized for future service increases.
Keeping top of mind, the agency’s on-going response to the pandemic, the substantial ridership decline,
resource allocation, and the recovery timing uncertainty signifies the agency’s substantial legitimate
justification for maintaining the COVID-19 related service changes made in April 2020.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The adoption of the COVID-19 Title VI Service Equity Analysis does not result in any direct or
foreseeable financial impacts.

Executive Summary
The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) published guidance on April 7, 2020, to provide clarity how
COVID-19 preparations impact certain FTA requirements. The guidance details when a Title VI service
equity analysis must be performed for emergency service cuts and changes during the pandemic.
Specifically, if a transit agency chooses to make any temporary changes permanent, the agency is then
required to complete a service equity analysis to ensure the changes do not unfairly impact minority and
low-income populations. Of note, a permanent change is any service change lasting longer than 12
months.
With steep declines in ridership and an uncertain return to higher demand, service reductions enacted
within the January 2020 runboard have remained in place until the current March 2021 runboard.
Moreover, RTD reduced service on April 19, 2020, to reflect the reality of declining ridership resulting
from the COVID-19 pandemic. Because these changes are approaching the end of 12-month period, the
FTA considers these changes permanent and requires an equity analysis to be performed. This document
summarizes the detailed analysis of the service changes between April 2020 and April 2021 to ensure
changes have not inequitably impacted minority and low-income populations.

Methodology
RTD’s established Title VI program methodology defines the process to identify major service changes,
disparate impacts, and disproportionate burdens. Analyses were performed at the route level, route
block group, and network level, to identify any potential disparities in service changes based on
race/ethnicity or income.

Major Service Changes
Changes to 103 existing bus route/patterns and rail lines in RTD’s network of 167 services from April 2020
to April 2021 meet established thresholds for a major service change. The routes listed below had
proposed reductions to service or were eliminated.

Findings
When considering all routes in the RTD network, and compared to the average 31% reduction in service,
low-income routes had a 13% smaller reduction compared to higher-income routes, and minority routes
had a 29% smaller reduction than non-minority routes.
Of the 103 routes with major service changes or reductions, none had adverse impacts when comparing
the service reductions of equity populations with those of non-equity populations. Low-income routes
had a 13% lower reduction than higher-income routes and minority routes had 12% less of a reduction
than non-minority routes.
Bus routes had a larger cut in service than rail modes, and of these bus routes with reductions in service,
suburban local and regional route service classes had greater reductions or more eliminations than Central
Business District (CBD) local and local route service classes. Limited stop routes were more likely to be
eliminated than local routes.
Of routes that had major service changes, 14 had potential disparate impact findings and 27 had potential
disproportionate burdens findings. Twelve routes had both.
Of routes that were eliminated, 12 had potential disparate impact findings and 38 had potential
disproportionate burdens findings. Nine routes had both.
Of new services or restructures, 7 routes had potential disparate impact findings and 6 had potential
disproportionate burdens findings. Three routes had both.
Corridor service changes within one-quarter mile of routes were reviewed for net service area changes,
incorporating the network benefits of overlapping and/or intersecting services. This analysis found 30 of
40 routes had smaller reductions in service than the corridor’s primary route, and all eliminated routes
had net corridor service changes that reflected a smaller reduction in service, indicating the availability of
other RTD services within a ¼ mile of the corridor, on average. However, only the corridor surrounding
Route 37 was found to have a net service change under the major service change threshold of 25%.

Introduction
Title VI and Environmental Justice
Equity is a core principle of the Regional Transportation District’s (RTD) mission to provide mass transit
service in the Denver Metro Area. An equitable mass transit system fairly distributes the benefits and
adverse effects of transit service without regard for race, color, national origin, or low-income status. This
principle is detailed and reinforced by Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Executive Order 12898
pertaining to environmental justice.
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin
in programs receiving federal financial assistance. Specifically, Title VI states, “No person in the United
States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied
the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial
assistance.”
In 1994, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12898, which states that each federal agency “shall
make achieving environmental justice part of its mission by identifying and addressing disproportionately
high and adverse human health or environmental effects of its programs, policies, and activities on
minority populations and low-income populations.”
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI and Environmental Justice. In this
circular, the FTA requires RTD to evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that
exceed the established major service change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a
disproportionately negative impact on minority or low-income populations.
This equity analysis report has been prepared to document changes that occurred between the January
2020 and March 2021 runboards, representing the prior 12 months of service. Routes with major service
changes include 40 major reductions, 63 eliminations, and 10 added services. In September of 2020, with
the opening of the N Line, a highly anticipated commuter rail line to the north suburbs, supporting bus
services were restructured. As a result, several routes underwent changes that on the surface appear to
be major service changes (e.g., a single route split into two patterns, route name changes, replacement
with other named routes, etc.). These changes and all others have been reviewed individually and in
aggregate at the block group and system levels to identify actual major changes.

An equity analysis is triggered by proposed major service changes to the transit services provided by RTD.
These changes include the addition of new routes, the elimination of existing routes, and changes to the
alignment and trip frequency within existing routes. RTD has established principles to identify the service
changes needed to meet the diverse travel needs of the residents of the District and maintain a highperformance, sustainable transit system.
RTD Service Changes Guiding Principles
• Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
• The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
• The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
• Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
• Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color
or national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
•Response to changes in the communities where services are provided.

RTD services are divided into various service classes depending on service type, route alignment, and
frequency. Each service class has its own service standards derived from the performance of all routes
within each class. RTD continually and comprehensively adjusts services in response to changes in
ridership and operational performance of the transit system. It is also the District’s responsibility to
identify services that are underperforming and recommend modifications, curtailment, or cancellation of
service as warranted. In keeping with Colorado Revised Statutes, RTD utilizes official service standards to
establish performance metrics used to identify underperforming services on a class-of-service basis. The
District uses these metrics to identify a series of service changes. Equity analyses examine the impact of
the proposed major service changes on minority populations and low-income households at or below 150
percent of the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.

…The general assembly further finds that the district should be organized efficiently,
economically, and on a demand-responsive basis and that the district should consider leastcost alternatives in discharging its responsibilities. The general assembly further finds that the
farebox recovery ratio of the district must be improved so that resources once allocated for
mass transportation can be made available for other surface transportation needs.
--Colorado Revised Statutes 32-9-119.7 Farebox Recovery Ratios -- Plans

RTD’s Title VI Equity Analysis Policies
Per FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Major Service Change Policy, a Disparate
Impact Policy, and a Disproportionate Burden Policy. Collectively, these policies provide foundational
requirements for evaluating service change proposals for equity and compliance with Title VI. These
policies and their applicable thresholds are listed below:

Service Change Philosophy

Packet Pg. 180

1. Major Service Change: A major service change is defined as a 25 percent addition or reduction in
the service hours of any route that would remain in effect for twelve (12) or more months. All
major service changes will be subject to an equity analysis that includes an analysis of adverse
effects.
a. An Adverse Effect is defined as a geographical or temporal reduction in service that
includes, but is not limited to, eliminating a route, shortening a route by eliminating
segments, rerouting an existing route, and increasing headways. RTD shall consider the
degree of adverse effects and analyze those effects when planning major service changes.
2. Disparate Impact Analysis: A major service change should not adversely affect a minority
population 10 percent more than non-minority populations; this level of impact is considered a
disparate impact.
3. Disproportionate Burden Analysis: A major service change should not adversely affect a lowincome population 10 percent more than higher-income populations; this level of impact is
considered a disproportionate burden. A low-income population is a group of households who
are at or below 150 percent of the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.
If a proposed major service change results in a disparate impact or a disproportionate burden, RTD will
consider modifying the proposed service change. RTD will then analyze the modification and make sure it
removed the potential disparate impact or disproportionate burden. If a less discriminatory option cannot
be identified and RTD can demonstrate a substantial legitimate justification for the proposed service
change, the FTA may allow RTD to proceed with the proposed change.

Analysis
Data Sources & Methodology
Demographic data used for this analysis comes from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey
(ACS) 5-Year Estimates for years 2014 to 2018 and is reviewed at the census block group geographic level.
Analysis of RTD’s network footprint and route service levels utilized Remix, a transit-planning software
package combining data analysis with transit service planning tools. One key evaluation tool is the Title
VI analysis used for service equity analyses which compares existing service, converted into annualized
bus visits, or trips, to a set of proposed service changes. The annualized bus visits conversion is a helpful
proxy for route service changes since any change in service levels will be proportional to the resultant
annualized change in trips. Other data includes route alignments and block group geography. The linking
of these datasets into a service-geographic-demographic combination relates equity populations with
changes in service at a geographic level to aid in reviewing impacts.
The equity analysis is a three-tier process reviewing impacts first at an individual route level, then at an
aggregated route block group level, and finally at a District/block group level, being careful to realize that
analyses done at aggregate levels could hide major service change impacts occurring at a more granular
level, so detailed analysis is done at each tier to avoid overlooking potentially adverse impacts on equity
groups.
Low-income status for population within the District derives from the Census Bureau and is based on 150%
of the United States federal poverty level (Department of Health and Human Services guidelines), based

on local context, which is an annual income of $32,580 for a family of 3. Minority status was based on the
non-white and Hispanic or Latino count of total population. The service area was based on the collection
of block groups within the District boundaries set by RTD for Remix.
Route service area population was determined using a quarter mile “catchment area” centered around
bus stops and rail stations. This catchment area was then used to calculate the percentage overlap of
census block-based population underneath. For instance, if a catchment area contained 100% of the
underlying block group, 100% of the population would be associated with the services within a quarter
mile; if 50% of a block group was contained in the catchment area, only half of the underlying population
would count as being included (ratios of population demographics would be unchanged).
Remix provides a count of trips in the “before” and “after” networks at the block group level and
aggregated at the route pattern level but does not provide a change of trips by route by block group,
which was needed for more detailed analysis at the route level. For this third tier of analysis, route
alignments from RTD’s General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data were used to calculate the quartermile catchment area of every route to relate the route trip change data from Remix to individual block
groups associated with each route.

The public was also notified of the ability to submit comments to service.changes@rtd-denver.com. The
main comments were related to the opposition of the Route LD and Route LX service change. Other emails
were general inquiries about the Route 37 and 46.
Covid-19 Service Reductions (April 2020)
RTD’s traditional outreach and community engagement was not pursued due to the nature of the April
2020 service reductions. In short, the ability to devise and carry out a robust and inclusive outreach
strategy was limited due to a compressed timeline and resource constraints. This was a result of the sharp
decline in ridership attributed to the coronavirus pandemic. To summarize, the community engagement
efforts, all outreach was conducted electronically via media releases, updates on the main RTD webpage,
email blast to our customers and service alerts on the lines where service was reduced.
Customer Care staff received comments during the Covid-19 service reductions. These comments were
compiled daily and sent to a team of RTD staff. Most comments related to Covid-19 service reductions
were due to being passed up by a full bus, bus overcrowding, and operators or customers not wearing a
mask. Additionally, there were concerns of rear door boarding for customers with a disability as well as
specific route suspensions and eliminations.
Routes that received a high number of complaints for pass ups and overcrowding include routes 12,
15/15L, 16, and 0. Routes 43 and 121 did not receive the same volume of complaints regarding pass ups
and overcrowding but were notably higher than other routes. These local routes have a higher number of
minority and low-income customers compared to the system district average.

Comment Summary
There was a strong opposition to the RunRide suspension due to the BolderBoulder’s 3 use and
dependency on this service. Additional strong opposition was related to the Mallride, Route 99L, 32, 16L,
225, JUMP and 403 service cuts. Of these routes both the 99L and 16L had a noticeably larger number of
people make comments regarding their reliance on these routes to have access to work and other
essential trips. The Route LD trip cuts proved to be a concern for those in Lafayette as it was described
that the current service is already minimal.
Several members of the public voiced concern regarding the R Line, 153, and 157 as they are all routes
some local residents rely on. Residents in Aurora gave mention to already drastic changes in service that
have occurred by RTD in the recent years. Due to issues with connectivity, transfers, and access the D Line
was brought up. Some commenters wanted it to return to how it previously was and there was also a
desire not to end the weekend trips this service provides. Also, two people brought up the conditions of
the Lafayette Park-n-ride. RTD staff informed them it is currently in construction and is being worked on.
Additional comments were made regarding the operator shortage as commenters asked questions related
to what is causing it, and how to solve the issues so cuts do not have to be made. RTD staff fielded
questions to assure the public that resolutions are being identified.
Emails
The public was notified of the ability to submit comments to service.changes@rtd-denver.com. Emails
were received from all parts of RTD’s service area. Key routes of concern according to email volume
included the Runride, Route 157, Route 153, and the R Line.
Mail
Cards with the words “No to Cuts” were received from residents in Aurora. The cards detailed service
changes of concern that were reflective of emailed comments as well. The key routes of concern included
Route 153, Route 130, Route 169, Route 157, H Line, E Line, and the R Line.

On July 14, 2020 the Board approved the recommended action to approve the implementation of the N
line and subsequent changes related it. It was not considered a service change and modifications were
nuanced changes with the Covid-19 plan.
Public Meetings
Five public hearings were held during the public comment period, which extended from August through
September of 2019. The meetings were held in Thornton City Call, Northglenn Senior Center, Blake
Street Offices, and the City of Westminster. There were 60 participants in attendance at the public
meetings total. Detailed comments from each meeting can be found in the July 14, 2020 consolidated
agenda starting on packet page 17. 4
In summary the main questions and concerns during the public comment period were the actual date of
the 2020 N Line opening. Approximately seven people made remarks indicating doubts of predicted
2020 opening due to past delays. General questions regarding how the N Line will affect other routes
were the next frequently asked questions. Additionally three people had concerns of the frequency of
the 92/93L frequency. One person mentioned that the 88 on time performance was not accurate and
one other person mentioned a desire to extend the route further. The 104L and 39L going away were of
the most concern to those that spoke at the public meetings.
Email
The public was notified of the ability submit comments to service.changes@rtd-denver.com. One letter
was received from the Westminster Mayor’s office concerns and support for the proposal. Specifically
there were concerns noted regarding the Route 120 boarding location due to the proximity of a high
volume road and the AA projected to have a negative citizen reaction due to added travel time. A
positive note regarding the 114 changes to added connections was also noted.
January 2021 Service Change
Notification was given to customers about the January 2021 service changes via rider alert emails about
upcoming service changes and the opportunity to submit feedback by emailing service.changes@rtddenver.com, faxing comments to 303.299.2227, or calling 303.299.6000.
Virtual Meetings and Events
RTD hosted a series of 5 virtual public outreach sessions in the first half of October 2020 to provide an
overview of proposed service changes. Microsoft Teams meetings were limited to 250 participants per
meeting. Four Microsoft Teams meetings were held with the option to participate via telephone or
through the Microsoft Teams App. The table below shows the dates and number of attendees per
meeting:

One in English and one in Spanish version of the recorded Microsoft Teams meetings were uploaded to
the rideRTDco Youtube page and have been archived on the Final January 2021 Service Change webpage 5.
There were approximately 148 views of the pre-recorded videos, 109 of the English video and 39 views of
the Spanish video, by the final date of the public comment period of October 14, 2020.
Additionally, a Facebook Live event was held October 12, 2020. This was the first time a Facebook Live
event has taken place to inform customers about RTD’s service change. Fifty-two people were recorded
as the peak number of viewers during the Facebook Live event. Comments and questions ranged from the
return to regular service on the system to explanation of the changes posed for Route 206. Since the date
of the Live event to March 18, 2021 the video has received additional activity demonstrated in the
following below:

Major Service Change, Disparate Impact, and Disproportionate Burden Analysis
Service changes made between January 2020 and March 2021 that resulted in a 25% or greater reduction
or addition in service were categorized by equity grouping (minority or non-minority, low-income or
higher income) for comparison. Routes were categorized as either equity or non-equity based on their
identification within the January 2020 network using 2018 ACS 5-year demographic data. A comparative

equity analysis was completed to review the routes individually. This analysis identified the equity and
non-equity populations within a route service area and compared those against the equity and non-equity
populations of the District. If impacted equity populations within the route service area received 10% or
greater impacts compared to non-equity populations, the route had a potential finding of disparate
impact or disproportionate burden (depending on the impacted equity population) and was flagged for
more detailed review of block groups within the route’s service area. This was intended to identify
network-level impacts that would indicate whether 25% or more service was changed for the underlying
population groups due to overlapping or intersecting services.

Changes by Transit Mode
When annual service changes were reviewed by mode, light rail had a 23% reduction of service over an
annualized count. Commuter rail increased due to the introduction of N Line service and rail overall was
reduced by nearly 16%. Bus service was reduced by nearly 34%. The overall average for the system was
a reduction of roughly 31%.

Major service changes between January 2020 and March 2021 included a total of 103 routes/lines that
received major service reductions or were fully eliminated. Of these routes, 40 had major service
reductions and 63 were eliminated.

Changes by Route Service Class
Service changes were reviewed by service class, categories generally describing the geographic location
or service area (and unique performance thresholds) of each route. Service changes included all major
service reductions or additions. Service classes include 4 categories for bus services: Central Business
District (CBD) Local, Urban Local, Suburban Local, and Regional, a rail category, and 3 special services
(MallRide, MetroRide, and the Englewood Trolley). Generally, service cuts were more severe for
suburban local and regional services, than CBD or Urban Local routes. Rail received the fewest cuts,
likely due to mandated service levels on commuter rail services and new N Line commuter service. CBD
locals, and the related downtown services of MallRide and MetroRide as well as Regional services, had
more reductions in service compared to Urban Locals.

Major Service Change Review
A complete listing of all service changes can be found in Appendix A. Changes were first reviewed in
aggregate equity groupings of routes prior to individual review of routes, route block groups, and overall
network levels; equity grouping comparison occurred at every level. Major service changes are
categorized as the following:
•
•

Major Service Reductions or Eliminations (a service reduction of 25% or more)
Major Service Increases/Restructuring (service increases of 25% or more related to new or
restructured service)

Major Service Change Reductions/Eliminations
Routes with major service changes included 40 routes with service reductions of 25% or greater and 63
eliminated routes, totaling 103 routes with major service reductions or eliminations (see table below).

Ten routes were found to have major service change increases, due to their occurrence in the September
2020 runboard and their association with the introduction of the N-Line and related service restructuring.
These included the following routes: N Line, Route 49, Route 88L, Route 93L, Route 104L, Route 120E,
Route 120L, Route 520, Route NB1 and Route NB2.
Routes 49, 88L, 93L, 104L, and 120E/L are directly attributed to N-Line service. Route 520 was part of a
route restructure from the elimination of Route RC and other changes in Brighton. Finally, the NB route
to Nederland was split into two patterns, NB1 (primary route) and NB2 (seasonal).

Figure 1. N-Line service area changes

Route-Level Analysis
Having identified the service changes which meet the definition of Major Service Change, the next step in
the analysis is to look at each line individually to determine potential Disparate Impacts (minority
populations) and/or Disproportionate Burdens (low-income populations). Both service reductions and

service increases are analyzed. For service increases, the analysis examines the extent to which the
benefits of the improvements are inclusive of minority and low-income populations. For service
decreases, the analysis examines the extent to which the adverse effects of the reductions are
disproportionately borne by minority and low-income populations.
DISPARATE IMPACT AND DISPROPORTIONATE BURDEN ANALYSIS
For each route with a major service change, determine the percent of the route’s impacted equity
and non-equity populations comprising the District’s equity and non-equity populations; if the
difference is greater than 10% for equity populations, additional review is required for potential
adverse impacts

In concert with RTD’s Title VI policies, the demographics of each of major service change routes were
reviewed for potential disparate impact (DI) or disproportionate burden (DB) findings. In summary, the
review of these adverse impacts determined the following:
•
•
•

33 routes met the threshold for a potential disparate impact
77 routes met the threshold for a potential disproportionate burden
24 met thresholds for both impacts

A complete listing of all potential DI and DB findings can be found in Appendix B.

Route-Block Group (Corridor) Analysis
This analysis reviews service changes reviewed at the route-block group level. This reviews the impacts of
overlapping and intersecting services to determine the “net” service change within a route corridor. For
instance, if an eliminated limited service operated in the same corridor as a local service, the net change
determined from the route-block group analysis would group all the trips together to determine the net
effect of the elimination. This provides an aggregate, high level indication of the average amount of service
provided to the average user randomly across the route’s corridor. It is an imperfect analysis, however,
since it does not provide a true sense of alternative connections to the average user within that corridor
based on how service levels changed for the primary route. However, because many of RTD’s routes
operate within a grid network, it can provide a sense of overall service levels.
ROUTE-BLOCK GROUP (CORRIDOR) ANALYSIS PROCESS
1. Identify routes with major service reductions or increases of 25% or greater and potential
disparate impact or disproportionate burden findings
2. Identify block groups within those route service areas and determine net (corridor) change
in service
3. Routes with alignment changes will compare old and new alignments for impacts
4. Route corridor major service changes of 25% or greater (+/-) should be reviewed for
potential DI or DB impacts as previously determined

Of the 40 routes with major service reductions, the corridor “net” service review found 30 routes that
had a lower net corridor change in service. Of the 63 eliminated routes, all routes had net corridor
service changes with less of a reduction. Table 8 provides a summary of routes with major service
changes, organized by service change type (reduction, elimination, addition), individual route service
change percent between January 2020 and March 2021, and the “net” percent corridor service change.
Routes with green shading are those where the net corridor service change is of a smaller magnitude than
the individual route service change.

A network analysis is not typical in RTD’s equity analyses but was used to understand the large number of
service changes occurring across the network. A network level analysis has potential to provide further
understanding of changes to service levels for Title VI protected populations at aggregate levels.
While RTD has not established a formal policy for a network level analysis, the major service change
threshold of 25% or greater used for individual route-level analyses was used as precedent to determine
potential adverse impacts overall and to identify structural issues in areas requiring further review. Once
average District thresholds for low-income and minority populations were established, subsequent equity
analyses focused on the subset of District block groups that experienced major service changes of 25% or
greater (additions or reductions in service), and whether equity block groups with major service changes
experienced service changes of 10% or more compared to non-equity block groups. Routes with major
service changes are later comparatively reviewed for potential adverse effects at route-block group levels
(block groups within route service areas).
The analysis of the combined service changes identified the following:
•

•

•

•

Systemwide, service was reduced by 31.8%, with almost one quarter of light rail service reduced
(existing commuter lines were contractually obligated to be maintained and overall service
improved due to new N Line service) and almost a third of overall bus service cut. Major service
changes were applicable to the entire network.
Due to cratering ridership and difficulty with staffing, 63 bus routes were eliminated, and 40 of
167 total routes had cuts of 25% or more, though the net effect is less when accounting for direct
replacements (such as local routes substituting for limited routes) or changes related to the N Line
opening.
Comparing changes Districtwide and only for areas with major service changes greater than 25%,
low-income block groups and minority block groups received fewer cuts than non-equity block
groups, staying under the 10% difference threshold.
At the route level, equity routes and non-equity routes 7 were compared both District-wide and
only for those with major service changes (in this case, nearly all changes were reductions when
excluding new or replacement routes related to the N Line opening). The comparison found that
while the system had drastic cuts, equity routes received far fewer reductions in service than nonequity routes: low-income routes saw 13% fewer cuts than higher-income, and minority routes
received 29% fewer cuts than non-minority routes.

In aggregate, a review of all routes found no adverse impacts between equity and non-equity routes.
Systemwide, although low-income routes had a greater number of annual trips reduced than higherincome routes, the reductions resulted in a 29% decrease in service compared with the 42% reduction in
higher-income routes. The reductions to minority-classified routes were lower, both in terms of annual
trips and percent change, than non-minority routes. As a result, minority routes were reduced 16%,
compared to 44% for non-minority routes.

Based on existence of the route within the January 2020 network and the population within a quarter mile of bus
stops or rail stations. 2018 5-Year estimates were used for population identification.

This pattern continued with routes that underwent major service reductions. Low-income routes
underwent a decrease of 55% in annual trips compared with higher-income routes that underwent a 68%
reduction. Minority routes underwent a 49% reduction in annual trips compared with 61% for nonminority routes.
In terms of major service increases, low-income routes will have 36% more trips than higher-income
routes. Similarly, minority routes will have roughly 5 times as many trips than non-minority routes (74,290
more annually).

For the January 2020 to March 2021 network change, an analysis of all District block groups and their
service levels was conducted to establish the baseline equity thresholds for low-income and minority
populations and to determine the systemwide magnitude of impacts of the January 2020 to March 2021
service change. Block groups with low-income and minority populations at or above the District average
are referred to in this analysis as “equity” block groups whereas higher-income and non-minority block
groups are referred to as “non-equity” block groups.

NETWORK ANALYSIS PROCESS
Determine block groups at/above District averages for low-income population (16.8%) and minority
population (35.4%)
Determine which block groups experienced service changes of 25% or more
Of block groups with a major service change, compare the difference in annual trips for equity versus nonequity block groups; if the difference is more than 10%, review for potential adverse impacts

There are 1,916 block groups defined as being wholly within or mostly within the District 8. Using the 2018
5-Year ACS Estimates, total population residing within these block groups was calculated as well as the
total minority population and total low-income population, calculated separately, to determine the
District-wide low-income and minority rates which set the thresholds for which block groups are classified
as above average. While the percent minority figure of 35.4% was derived by using the base population
of the service area (3.019 million) the low-Income population percentage of 16.8% is derived from a
slightly smaller population figure. This is due to the smaller population whose poverty status the Census
Bureau can determine 9. The thresholds summarized in Table 0 yielded 751 (39% of all) block groups above
the District average for low-income population, and 715 (37%) block groups above the District average for
minority population.

Table 11 summarizes the change in trips for equity and non-equity block groups District-wide, only block
groups with major service reductions, and only those with increases. Most block groups across the District
received substantial service reductions, however, systemwide service reductions appear to have
impacted equity groups modestly less than non-equity block groups, but service increases were mixed
with higher-income and minority groups receiving more service than low-income and non-minority
groups. For block groups with a major service reduction, those with above average low-income population
received around 3% fewer cuts, block groups with above average minority populations received around
5% smaller reduction in service compared to non-minority block groups. For block groups with major
service increases, primarily due to the introduction of N line service and restructuring, higher-income
block groups received more service. Minority block groups received nearly 12% more trips than nonminority block groups with major service increases.

Some block groups are not completely contained within the District boundaries due to differences in boundaries
between the District and Census-defined geographies.

The total population whose poverty status is determinable/assessed is lower than the estimate of total
population and results in a different base population used to determine low-income percent of population.

Figures 2 and 3 illustrate the location of above average low-income and minority block groups within the
District. Low-income populations and minority populations appear to overlap in similar areas outside of
central Denver, including most of Aurora, Commerce City, and Brighton, and areas east of Boulder, and
areas southeast of Longmont. Low-income populations appear to have greater spread, with additional
areas in the mountain communities and areas west of Downtown Denver.

The January 2020 to March 2021 changes in annual trips by route are symbolized in Figure 6. The purpose
of this map is to provide a generalized view of where service is changing at the route level. The March
2021 bus and rail network, as well as the eliminated routes from the January 2020 network are colorized
according to the percentage change in the annual trips. The March 2021 network resulted in several
routes being eliminated or truncated. These routes and the truncated segments are shown in red. In
instances where several routes serve one corridor, the colors are layered to give preference to green down
to red. Therefore, some truncated segments may not appear as they continue to be served by other
routes. However, routes that have been eliminated entirely but are still served by other routes will outline
the continuing service in red. An example of this scenario is the D-line, which is shown in green and
outlined in red. This is the result of the elimination of the C-line with slight increases in D-line service.
As detailed in the map, the majority of route eliminations are occuring in the periphery of the network
and regional in focus. This includes some of the connections between Longmont and Denver, for example.
Most of the urban core routes will face limited reductions in service, represented in yellow, although some
of the east to west bus connections in the urban core are eliminated. In terms of service increases or new
routes, represented in green, much of it is due to the introduction of N-Line commuter rail service and it’s
related bus services that serve the stations. Some of it is also due to the consolidation of overlapping
services, such as the Nederland routes west of Boulder.

Summary of Findings
The primary objective of this equity analysis was to examine proposed changes to RTD’s network at the
individual route, route block group, and network route and block group levels, to determine if low-income
and minority populations were more adversely impacted with changes than higher-income and nonminority populations. Future analyses may separate network analyses from traditional equity analyses
and network analyses may rely on different service change thresholds and may be subject to additional
refinements to identify potential adverse effects to equity populations. For instance, network changes
could be compared to see how equity areas receive service over time or routes could be grouped into
equity classes to also see how those routes are served longitudinally.
The network changes that occurred between January 2020 to March 2021 include the continuing service
changes originally proposed in April 2020 to address the continuing impacts of ridership and revenue loss
due to the current COVID-19 global pandemic. Ridership behavior has exhibited acute changes that are
without historical precedent. Routes primarily serving office-type jobs (some CBD locals and particularly
Regional services) have seen steep declines as have routes that primarily serve educational campuses
since telecommuting and virtual learning have supplanted in-person interactions. Routes that provide
service for predominantly equity populations, or those who may more likely be essential staff working in
health care, public safety, government, food systems and other service sectors lacking remote work
options, have had fewer reductions in ridership. As such, RTD has prioritized service changes that attempt
to account for ridership demands while maintaining social distancing as much as possible on other routes.
A summary of potential disparate impacts and disproportionate burden findings include the following.
Disparate Impacts
An analysis of routes with major service changes found 40 routes with major service reductions, 63
eliminations and 10 new services. Of the routes with reductions, potential disparate impacts were found
for 14 of the 40 routes, and of the 63 eliminated routes, 12 were found to have potential disparate
impacts. (Twelve routes had both DI and DB findings.) Of routes categorized as new or restructured
services, 7 were found to have potential disparate impacts.
When accounting for corridor service levels to determine a net service change across a route’s corridor,
some routes may have a smaller service change impact. This accounted for overlapping and intersecting
services that may provide a similar level of service. Accounting for this review, only Route 37 had a smaller
corridor service reduction comparing to the route level change. Of the eliminated routes, the AA route
was found to have a service change under -25%.
Disproportionate Burden
An analysis of routes with major service changes found 40 routes with major service reductions, 63
eliminations and 10 new services. Of the routes with reductions, potential disproportionate burdens were
found for 27 of the 40 routes, and of the 63 eliminated routes, 38 were found to have potential
disproportionate burdens. (Nine eliminated routes had both DI and DB findings.) Of routes categorized
as new or restructured services, 6 were found to have potential disproportionate burdens.
When accounting for corridor service levels to determine a net service change across a route’s corridor,
some routes may have a smaller service change impact. This accounted for overlapping and intersecting

services that may provide a similar level of service. Accounting for the corridor review, Route 37 had a
smaller corridor service reduction comparing to the route level change like the potential disparate impact
finding. No eliminated routes had a corridor service change under the major service change threshold.
Table 12 summarizes major service changes by change type, provides findings of potential disparate
impacts and disproportionate burdens based on a comparative difference analysis, provides the individual
route service change, and the net corridor service change. Routes with green highlighted net corridor
service change values indicate routes where the net corridor service change was found to be below the
25% threshold for major service changes. Note that this differs from green highlighting found in Table 8
which identified net corridor service changes that were simply lower in magnitude than the individual
route service change.

May 2020 Service Changes
Due to an ongoing operator shortage, the May Service Change Proposal included a mix of service
adjustments and reductions aimed to prevent missed trips and improve service reliability. The May 2020
Service Change proposals reflected the need to reduce the number of operators necessary to provide
RTD’s transit services, thereby better matching service offerings to the operator headcount at the time.
Changes were approved by the board on the March 10, 2020 during the Operations and Customer Service
Committee as a recommended action. However, the service changes were not implemented due to Covid19. Details of the service reductions can be found in the FA&A/Ops Consolidated Agenda 11 starting on
packet page 3. Table A-2 provides the change type, route, and description of the board approved change.

September 2020 Service Change
Under normal circumstances the board approves September 2020 Service Changes at the July Operations
and Customer Service Committee as a recommended action. Due to the nature of Covid-19, the Covid-19
service plan was still in place during the July meeting, however updates were made to the ongoing Covid19 service plan. The list of changes to the Covid-19 service plan were provided to the board on July 14,
2020 and can be found on the FA&A/Ops Consolidated Agenda 13 starting on packet page 71.
At the July 14, 2020 meeting, the Board approved the recommended action to implement the N line and
subsequent changes related it. It was not considered a service change and modifications were nuanced
changes with the Covid-19 plan.

•

Introduction of the N Line Bus and Rail Service Plan under Covid-19 protocols, which provide
Saturday Levels of service for both bus and rail. N Line rail will operate on a 30-minute all-day
frequency

•

Minor schedule adjustments to increase on-time performance on the following services: 15, 21,
30, 31, 83, 204, 326, NB, H, R and W Lines

•

Return of school tripper service operated via Special Service Order, to maximize flexibility, as
school districts complete their plans for the upcoming school year

January 2021 Service Change
The proposed January 2021 service adjustments were a mix of service enhancements, service reductions
and service suspensions in order to maximize ridership within the very limited resources available to the
District as a result of the financial shortfalls resulting from the COVID induced economic slowdown. The
proposals included a mix of service adjustments that represent the redeployment of resources available
during the COVID-19 service plan.
Weekday ridership on local bus service continued at levels approximately 45% of pre-COVID levels while
ridership on Regional services, Flatiron Flyer services and light rail services saw weekday ridership declines
of 75%-85%. These ridership numbers were largely affected by reduced commuter activity and reduced
employment center occupancy.
Overall, the proposals redirected resources from services that were underperforming to services that have
passenger capacity challenges due to limits set by social/physical distancing policies that limit capacity on
each RTD vehicle to approximately 30% of pre-COVID capacity. Additionally, the proposals modified
service patterns and levels of service on rail corridors to more effectively match service to ridership
demand.
The January 2021 service changes were approved by the board on the October 20, 2020 during the
Operations and Customer Service Committee as a recommended action. A list of the approved changes
with a brief summary are included in the Table A-4 below. A full detailed summary of changes can be
found in the FA&A/Ops Consolidated Agenda 14 starting on packet page 144.

Appendix C: Route Service Area Comparative Equity Population
Analysis by Service Change Category
An additional analysis was performed on demographics within subsets of routes within the RTD network.
This analysis extends beyond RTD’s Title VI Program requirements and represents a more granular
examination of potential impacts to equity and non-equity groups. This analysis aims to provide greater
detail on the overall impacted populations within equity groupings of routes by the related service change
impacts. Results from this analysis may be informative when considering future modifications to service
for equity populations.
The population within one-quarter mile of route/line stops/stations was totaled for different tiers of
routes. Total population, minority population, non-minority population, low-income population, and
higher-income populations were totaled within each subset of routes. Each equity population’s
comprising share of the District equity population was determined for comparison purposes, similar to
the route level comparative difference analysis. Routes were categorized by those with major service
reductions/eliminations and those with major service additions. Within those two categories, routes were
further divided into low-income/higher-income and minority/non-minority routes based on the service
area demographics of those routes within the January 2020 network. As with previous analyses presented
in this report, demographics are sourced from the 2018 ACS 5-Year Estimates.
Equity and non-equity populations were compared within each subset of routes. For instance, minority
and non-minority populations were compared within low-income routes that had major service
reductions/eliminations. Similarly, low-income and higher-income populations were compared within
minority routes that received major service increases.
The results from the analysis indicate potential adverse effects to subsets of population by route service
change category. Low-income routes that received major service reductions/eliminations appear to
potentially affect minority populations 14% greater than non-minority populations. When looking at
minority routes that had service reductions/eliminations, minority populations were potentially affected
up to 53% more than non-minority populations.
Low-income populations living with the service area of low-income routes that received a major service
reduction/elimination appear to be potentially affected 40% more than higher-income populations within
those route service areas. For low-income populations within minority route service areas that received
a service reduction/elimination, their potential impact was 42% greater than higher-income populations.
For routes with service increases, minority and low-income populations appear to be potentially
benefiting more than non-equity groups. Service increases for low-income and minority routes appear to
potentially benefit minority populations more than non-minority groups; minority route increases
potentially benefit both equity groups as well. Interestingly, lower-income populations within higherincome routes with service increases benefited nearly 750% more than higher-income populations.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Small Business Enterprise (SBE) Program Update

Committee Meeting Date:
April 13, 2021

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Zamy Silva, Senior Manager, Civil Rights
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD’s Small Business Office (SBO) created the Small Business Enterprise (SBE) Certification Program to
promote the use of economically disadvantaged businesses in a race-neutral framework. The SBO is
committed to fostering equal opportunity to SBEs and Disadvantaged Business Enterprises (DBE) by
creating a level playing field, removing barriers and assisting in SBEs/DBEs development so they can
compete fairly for RTD contracting opportunities.
DISCUSSION
The SBO temporarily suspended the acceptance of new SBE Certification program applications in 2021.
RTD currently has 451 active, certified SBEs within its database which can pursue contracting
opportunities with RTD. Considering the temporary suspension, RTD is optimizing relationships with the
City and County of Denver and Colorado’s Department of Transportation to utilize their certification
programs as to not impact SBE’s contracting opportunities, thus the certifications RTD will accept
include:
•

•

City and County of Denver
▪ SBE
▪ Minority/Women Business Enterprise (M/WBE)
▪ DBE
Colorado Department of Transportation’s
▪ DBE

RTD’s Small Business Office will continue to:
• Have a stable SBE Program that aims to increase the participation of SBEs on RTD’s projects
• Create opportunities for SBEs to compete fairly on RTD’s projects and level the playing field
• Assess projects and establish SBE goals on projects
• Manage SBE database of certified firms and process annual updates and renewals for currently
SBE certified firms
• Monitor SBE compliance on all contracts awarded to SBEs or contacts with SBE goals.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The RTD SBE certification program’s temporary suspension was part of the agency-wide 2021 budget
adjustments made as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The savings netted is $184,820 from the
elimination of the Small Business Office’s Certification Specialist position.

Updates for ACPD Committee:
 High Block Vote
Committee Chair Jaime Lewis explained that the purpose of the vote is for the
committee to go on the record taking a stance on the matter and is not to
prevent the committee from continued suggestions to RTD staff.
Joe Lamers made three points:
1. The committee’s role is one of advisory, meaning that RTD staff considers
the recommendations and is not obligated to implement.
2. Policies can be changed and if the high block policy is not working it can
be revisited.
3. The importance of remembering during tough discussions that committee
members and RTD staff are all people.
Earl Lee asked how much of a problem are the high blocks, specifically if their
use and the amount of people using them delay trains. Zamy Silva, Civil Rights
Senior Manager, replied that prior to the pandemic there were not many
concerns. Complaints started coming in once the policy of not allowing anyone
else except persons with a mobility device or mobility impaired customers was
implemented. Anne Hillyer, ADA Investigator/Specialist, who reviews and
generates RTD’s ADA complaint reports, affirmed Zamy Silva’s assertion.

Vivian Stovall noted that the complaints may not be coming to RTD because people
do not always do a formal complaint. She said that the community has complaints,
for example, when a person with a grocery cart full of personal items utilizes the high
block, which is a problem for those using wheelchairs. Vivian Stovall further stated
that drivers are confused because the instructions on who should use the high blocks
are not clear.
Brent Belisle stated that he has been riding RTD for over 20 years and he needs the
high block for his mobility device. He agrees that some people don’t use the high
block properly, but if people need to use them, he is ok with that. Brent Belisle
acknowledged that it is a touchy subject, and that operators should only allow people
with an impairment to sit in the disability seating area.
Kyle Bradell said that it is fine if anyone wants to use the high block but that should
not allow them to sit in the disability area. He suggested painting that area blue as it
is a universal sign for a disability area. Greg Martinez agreed with the blue space
recommendation as people are visual. He suggested using stripes as an option. Vivian
Stovall also agreed saying that people in buses respect the blue areas. Lynn Edmonds
agreed as well with using universal symbols and signs. She wondered what will be
done to enforce the usage of the disability area as drivers can only do so much. Zamy
Silva will discuss identifying the disability area with universal symbols with Dave
Jensen, Assistant General Manager of Rail Operations, and come back to the
committee with an update. She stated that Cal Shankster will address enforcement
during the updates.
Jaime Lewis explained that his concern is that the ACPD’s mandate is to protect access
to people with disabilities, not the general public. He stated that if the current policy
does not work, the disability community may come back to the committee and ask for
the committee’s action on the matter. The options for the committee are to do
nothing, object and move forward with recommendations, or support the opening of
the high block.
Kyle Bradell moved that the ACPD does not concur with the changes proposed by RTD
to the use of the high block as they will have a negative effect on disability community.
Vivian Stovall seconded the motion.
Vote: Motion carries with 7 votes in favor and 2 opposed.
Yes:

Jaime Lewis, Aaron Pasterz, Brent Belisle, Greg Martinez, Kyle Bradell,
Lynn Edmonds, Vivian Stovall.

No:

Earl Lee, Joe Lamers.

Updates on High Block Recommendations from ACPD Members from
November 19, 2020
Cal Shankster, Rail Operations Planning and Systems Senior Manager, updated the
committee on the following recommendations:

1. TSO's should assist conductors, when possible, to assist in securement area
disputes. This will help avoid interruptions in train operations.
Both Mike Meader, RTD’s Assistant General Manager of Safety, Security, and Asset
Management and Bob Grado, RTD’s Chief of Police and Emergency Management, are
on board with utilizing Transit Security Officers (TSOs) to assist with the enforcement
of priority access to mobility devices in the designated area. Staff will assess the
current TSO trainings to evaluate the need for additional training in assisting in this
matter.

2. Explore options for audio recording. "Riders who refuse to move when requested by
RTD staff can be subject to removal "
A message can be added to the system to play intermittently or as selected by the
operator. Staff acknowledged there is a cost and time investment to insert the
message in the system. However, this is important to RTD and RTD will proceed with
this recommendation. RTD staff will email verbiage of the message prior to going live
with the message.

3. Monitor new policy for violations that denies a PWD from accessing train and;
4. Monitor conductors to ensure they are providing instructions on a consistent manner.
RTD conducts regular ride checks with operators for customer service. Reported
incidents are investigated. Non-reported incidents are hard to correct. Current
monitoring and reports give the impression that denying access to people with
disabilities are not a big problem.
Committee members expressed that some operators do not receive the
commendations given by the public and people do not report incidents because they
never hear back on how it was resolved. Staff will investigate on the commendations
as those are important. Staff also explained that customers need to request a call
back when reporting a complaint.
Committee members asked regarding RTD surveys for the public regarding operations
and if the data is public. Staff will invite Jeff Tranguch, Market Research Manager, to
a future meeting to explain the logistics and any background information on RTD’s
surveys in order to assist the data reading the committee might decide to do.

Elevators at RTD Facilities
Sean Moran, Manager of Facilities Maintenance Contracted Facilities, explained that some
elevators at RTD facilities are owned by the agency while others are owned and operated
by other entities with RTD monitoring the maintenance. He clarified that all the calls
regarding facilities are monitored by RTD Police Dispatch at 303.299.2911 or through the
Transit Watch application. These methods of communication are available 24 hours a
day, 365 days a year. Callers are provided with a ticket number and may call back for
reference and follow up. He further noted that RTD has a service agreement with KONE
Elevators with a 90-minute response time. Denver Transit Operators has a service
agreement with Thyssen Krupp Elevators with a 120 minutes response time.
Committee members noted that the elevators at the Englewood, 38th and Blake, and
Sheridan stations are down frequently and have cleanliness issues. They asked if it would
be possible to place signage at all elevators with a number to call when an elevator is not
working. They also asked if there is a central number to call to find out if an elevator is
down prior to reaching the station. Staff replied that Customer Care would have
information on elevators not working as Rider Alerts are issued when an elevator is down.
Staff could place signage with a number for RTD owned and operated elevators and will
reach out to the Legal Department to see what type of signage, if any, can be placed on
elevators not operated by RTD. Staff will reach out to the Committee Chair via email with
an update when staff has had an opportunity to review and work on this matter.
Committee members suggested writing a letter to the governmental entities responsible
for elevators at RTD stations copying each county’s transportation and ADA point person.
The purpose of the letter would be to ask the entities for their help in complying with
ADA requirements and the elevators they operate at RTD related facilities. Committee
Chair will draft a letter and asked Sean Moran to attend the next meeting for an update.

this combination will help with Access-a-Ride scheduling.
o The requirements for a dispatch system are in development. Requirements would
include accessibility needs for users and staff. The Request for Proposal will be
released in March with the award by the end of 2021.
o A pilot with Uber for zip codes 80013 through 80016 started in October. Participation

Anne Hillyer, ADA Investigator/Specialist, asked Jaime Lewis and Vivian Stovall, whose
second term ends on August 31, 2021, if they would be willing to serve another year
on the committee. Jaime Lewis expressed his willingness to serve another year. Vivian
Stovall noted that her availability depends on when she can receive the COVID-19

Jaime Lewis asked the ACPD members to invite other people to apply for the
committee membership. Vivian Morales, Civil Rights Outreach Specialist, noted that
the online application for the ACPD will be active by the end of the month. The link
to the application will be sent to the committee members for recruitment purposes.
b. ACPD’s High Block Discussion Update (13 minutes)
i. Recording – Dave Jensen, AGM Rail Operations

Attachment: 2021-03-09 ACPD Joint Committee Minutes (4491 : Advisory Committee for People with Disabilities (ACPD) Report)

3.C.2.b

Dave Jensen, Assistant General Manager for Rail Operations, informed the
committee that he has consulted with RTD’s General Counsel and
Packet Pg. 271

Communications department in finalizing the draft language sent to the
committee via email. He noted that the final language will include wording
similar to “as required by Federal law”. Dave Jensen will send a final draft to
the committee for feedback prior to implementation.
Vivian Stovall commented that the fixed route buses have a blue area reserved
for people with disabilities and that the visual cue was helpful to encourage
other customers to move. Dave Jensen replied that he would look into the blue
are on the buses.
Lynn Edmonds asked if the recording also included a visual announcement for
the hearing impaired. Dave Jensen explained that both the audible and visual
announcements work in tandem.
ii. TSO/Transit Police Training – Bob Grado, Chief of Transit Police; Steve
Martingano, Deputy Chief of Police; Karl Ballard, Transit Police Lieutenant
Steve Martingano explained that Transit Police get messages sent out to them
immediately which they then forward to their team. He said that the emails
sent to security officers with updates to policies and procedures include a
checkbox for the recipient to acknowledge receipt. Transit police and security
officers have the policy of educating first, then following up with policy. Jaime
Lewis asked if there are any reports of transit police and/or security officers
having to engage with customers regarding vacating the space dedicated for
people with disabilities. Steve Martingano replied that there are not any recent
reports which probably has to do with the lower ridership and the lack of
activities, such as parade of lights, that would increase ridership. Dave Jensen
added that ridership being low is another reason why the recording process is
moving a bit slower since low ridership makes it hard to have an idea on impact
on regular ridership.
iii. Universal Symbol on light rail vehicles
Jaime Lewis stated that due to the settlement agreement newer light rail
vehicles have a universal symbol in the area for people with disabilities while
older trains do not have the symbol. Dave Jensen commented that he needed
clarity on what the committee means by universal symbol in the area as all
trains have a wheelchair symbol in the area for people with disabilities. Earl
Lee noted that the issue was trying to change the color of the floor in the area.
Dave Jensen said that his team is evaluating the cost on using paint in the
area. He added that an issue is that only the front of the first car of the train
is used as an area for people with disabilities and that each train has two areas
for when the train turns around. Painting all areas could be confusing for all
customers. Earl Lee agreed that this could generate confusion since the areas
are also used for bicycles when not designated as an area for people with
disabilities. Greg Martinez suggested mimicking the access aisle and using
diagonal blue stripes. Dave Jensen said that he would look into this matter.

c. ACPD Discussion on RTD’s Customer Service Surveys
Jeff Tranguch, Manager of Market Research, gave an overview of how RTD utilizes
surveys. He explained that the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) requires the
Packet Pg. 272

agency to do a customer survey every 3 years for both fixed routes and paratransit
on customers’ satisfaction regarding on time performance, local and regional services,
fares and payment, and demographics. Jeff Tranguch noted that RTD contracts out
that large survey as the agency does not have the capacity to perform that survey
internally. RTD performed the last survey in 2019 and the next one is in 2022. He
said that other surveys are done based on agency needs. For example, a survey was
sent out in the late summer of 2020 to over 400 paratransit customers regarding the
grocery delivery service implemented during the pandemic. Jeff Tranguch pointed out
that another survey done was for the Access-a-Ride customer portal from which
recommendations were received and implemented.
Vivian Stovall asked for clarification regarding the paratransit customer portal. She
wondered if it was a digital application or a web portal. Paul Hamilton, Senior Manager
of Paratransit Services, explained that it is a web portal designed to behave as an
application for ease of mobile use as well as use on a desktop. He will forward the
information on the web portal to both the ACPD and APAC.
Jaime Lewis said he was glad the next survey will be in 2022 as COVID-19 might skew
survey responses. He wondered if Jeff Tranguch and his team were doing surveys
regarding the Uber pilot. Jeff Tranguch said that his team is not involved. Larry Buter,
Manager of Paratransit Services, explained that they are making calls to customers
explaining how the pilot works. To date there have been about 200 trips. He suspects
that trips will increase once the pandemic is over.
Merv Martin, a member of APAC, wondered what percentage of Access-a-Ride rides is
being requested to Uber. Paul Hamilton explained that Access-a-Ride does about 1,000
trips a day. About 200 trips a month are on Uber. He emphasized that the pilot is
limited to zip codes in the Centennial area.
Roberto Cabrera, a member of APAC, wondered if there are other tools or plans to
update resources used near trains specifically for sensory disabilities. Dave Jensen said
that he was interested in the suggestions. He understands that RTD is ADA compliant
and would like to know if there is anything to be done to enhance accessibility given
financial constraints. Dave Jensen asked Roberto Cabrera to reach out to him for
more details.
d. Electronic Crossing Bell
Mark Clendennen, General Superintendent of Infrastructure, Commuter Rail, explained
that the purpose of attending the ACPD meeting was to gather feedback on electronic
crossing bells at gate and pedestrian crossings for commuter rail. The current bells in
neighborhood areas are all directional between 85 and 95 decibels. The suggestion is
to pilot a unidirectional bell between 75 to 85 decibels at the 124th station. He wanted
to engage the community of people with disabilities regarding the proposed pilot.
Jaime Lewis suggested using visual cues to assist with the audio signal. Mark
Clendennen clarified that the pedestrian and roadway crossings have visual lights with
FTA regulations on flashes per minute. The 75 decibel is still within the FTA
requirements. Jaime Lewis will email a person who works at the Colorado CrossDisability Coalition with the deaf community for feedback.

3.C.2.b

Packet Pg. 273

Greg Martinez reached out to the US Access Board and the board said that they do
not require bells. He asked Mark Clendennen if there was an image or video that
could be shared in order to better understand the unidirectional bell. Mark Clendennen
showed pictures in a document (attached) and this video found on YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYgx7D-PFTM. Greg Martinez asked if the bells
had any audible verbiage to alert customers. Mark Clendennen answered that it was
just a bell.
Andi Bailey wanted to ensure that the visually impaired could hear the bell. Mark
Clendennen clarified that the bell is located in between two tracks with flashing lights
adjacent. The roadway crossings have a bell on each side.
Jaime Lewis asked which stations would be next if the pilot proved successful. Mark
Clendennen explained that the goal is for every crossing after collecting data on the
pilot at 124th. He explained that the PUC needs to see data before performing another
pilot at another station. Mark Clendennen stated that since there was no objection
from the group his team would go ahead with the pilot on 124th.
Roberto Cabrera noted that at times stations lack on accommodations for people with
disabilities. Mark Clendennen pointed out that the commuter rail stations have tactile
stripping before entering the train as well as the lights and bells at crossings.
Earl Lee stressed the importance of the placement of the bells being consistent for
