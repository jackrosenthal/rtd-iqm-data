RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Nominating Committee of the Regional Transportation District (RTD) Citizens
Advisory Committee (CAC) that the RTD Board of Directors reappoint three members of the Committee
to an additional three-year term and appoint two new members to the Committee to three-year terms.
Core Goal #5 - Effective Communications & Community Outreach
BACKGROUND
RTD’s Citizens Advisory Committee is comprised of residents from around the region. Members are
appointed by RTD Board of Directors and volunteer their time to advise the District on a range of issues
that affect citizens and impact the region. Five current members’ terms expired on July 31, 2019.
Recruitment for citizens interested in serving was publicly advertised through the RTD website, local
publications and stakeholder e-mail distributions. Applicants were asked to submit an application
explaining why they wanted to serve on the Committee, describing what unique experience and skill-set
they would bring to the Committee, listing their affiliations and volunteer activities they believe will add
value to the Committee, and sharing a statement of personal objectives/goals if accepted for CAC
membership.
A total of 30 applications were received. Three current members are eligible for reappointment and two
of the three expressed an interest in continuing to serve on the Committee.
The Nominating Committee decided, based on attendance, participation at meetings and Committee
consistency to recommend reappointment of the three current members who requested reappointment.
The Nominating Committee then carefully reviewed each application received and conducted interviews
with short-listed applicants to fill two positions.
The following current members are recommended for reappointment to an additional three-year term
expiring July 31, 2022:

Modeling On-Call Contract Amendment

Assistant

General

Board Meeting Date:

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager to execute all documents necessary to amend the contract with
Cambridge Systematics for on-call travel modeling services to increase the contract not-to-exceed
amount by $1,300,000 to a total of $1,800,000. Funding for 2019 work orders to be issued under this
contract is included in the 2019 amended expense budget in the specific projects for which the work
orders will be issued. Funding for future work orders would be included in the 2020-2025 Mid-Term
Financial Plan in future projects.
This action addresses three of the General Manager’s goals for 2019:
Core Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management
Task Goal #3 – Ensure Fiscal Sustainability
Task Goal #4 – Address Future Transportation Needs and Methods
BACKGROUND
In August 2018, RTD awarded a contract to Cambridge Systematics to perform travel modeling on
an as-needed basis. The contract was awarded for three years, with two one-year renewable options
at RTD’s sole discretion, and a contract not-to-exceed amount of $500,000. The contractor
performs work when required due to limitations of RTD resources and/or expertise for the particular
task and time. Work is being performed in the context of RTD internal planning studies and RTD
budget development and contract analysis.
DISCUSSION
RTD uses travel modeling and ridership forecasting to support many of its planning efforts and
capital projects. RTD has three ongoing efforts for which we plan to utilize support from Cambridge
Systematics:
1. Update RTD’s existing travel models. Travel models are used to develop ridership forecasts and
related data for decision-making. The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) requires recipients of
Full Funding Grant Agreements (FFGAs) to regularly update travel models for the projects
receiving grants. RTD makes use of three travel models:
a. A traditional four-step model originally developed by DRCOG called Compass
b. A state-of-the-art tour-based model developed by DRCOG called Focus
c. A transit ridership forecasting model developed by FTA called Simplified Trips-on-Project
Software (STOPS)

Packet Pg. 46

11.B

2. Update RTD’s operating and maintenance (O&M) cost model. The current model was developed
in 2011, and it will need to be refined and enhanced to be used for the fiscal sustainability task
of the Reimagine RTD project.
3. Provide ridership forecasting services for Reimagine RTD. That planning effort will require
ridership forecasting for numerous transit alternatives to develop ridership and related data for
decision-making. Focus travel model updates are necessary in conjunction with developing
ridership forecasts for Reimagine RTD. Newer, more up-to-date socioeconomic data from DRCOG
will need to be reflected in the Reimagine RTD model runs. Additional consultant resources are
necessary to complete this process.
To date, RTD has issued two work orders under this contract for a total value of $324,162, leaving
$175,838 for additional work orders. Staff estimates the cost of the three work orders identified
above at $655,000, which exceeds the balance currently available under the contract. Funding for
the three work orders is included in the 2019 expense budget previously approved by the Board of
Directors.
In addition to the three specific work orders identified above, staff has identified a potential need for
ridership forecasting for additional projects over the remaining two year term of the initial contract.
These potential projects, estimated to cost up to $820,838, include the following:



Ridership forecasting as necessary for FasTracks unfinished corridors
Ridership forecasting for BRT corridors
- Identified in the Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS)
- SH-119
- Identified in the Regional BRT Feasibility Study




Ridership forecasting for East Colfax Bus Rapid Transit (BRT)
Miscellaneous ridership forecasting with RTD’s partner agencies such as the City and County of
Denver
Additional travel model updates, such as the parking cost model that is used within the travel
model



The additional $820,838 requested for future work orders would cover any potential needs for ridership
forecasting for these projects. The future work orders would be executed after Board consideration and
approval of the 2020 expense budget.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for 2019 work orders to be issued under this contract is included in the 2019 amended expense
budget in the specific projects for which the work orders will be issued. Funding for future work orders
would be included in the 2020-2025 Mid-Term Financial Plan in future projects.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs &
FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to execute
all documents necessary to amend the contract with Cambridge Systematics for on-call travel
modeling services to increase the contract not-to-exceed amount by $1,300,000 to a total of
$1,800,000. Funding for 2019 work orders to be issued under this contract is included in the

Funding for future work orders would be included in the 2020-2025 Mid-Term Financial Plan in
future projects.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. This is not recommended because it will delay the
completion of travel modeling for Reimagine RTD, Focus travel model calibration, and the O&M
cost model update.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorizes the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to increase the
contract authority amount with Cambridge Systematics. (Contract Number 15DJ005) from the current
level of $763,728.00 by $300,000 to new total contract amount of $1,063,728.00
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services
BACKGROUND
RTD selected Cambridge Systematics to develop RTD’s new Trip Planner using an Open Source Trip
planner. This trip planner replaced RTD’s existing Transtar and Google trip planners. The new trip planner
was launched in December 2016. This project under Contract Number 15DJ005 was completed in May
2017. During the lifecycle of the original project, several enhancements were requested which the
project team agreed would be reviewed after launch. In March 2018, a Sole source agreement was
awarded to Cambridge Systematics to work on these additional enhancements as Phase 2 – Open Trip
Planner Support and Maintenance. This project concluded in December 2018. RTD now has the ability to
have customers and customer care department on the same trip planner so we can service our
customers with the same information. The trip planner provides fixed route services integrated with
walking, biking and driving options.
The update to the trip planner will give us the ability to combine fixed route services with flex route
services and give the ability for customer and customer care agents to plan trips combining fixed route
and flex route services.
DISCUSSION
RTD is proposing a new Phase 3 for this project. The objective of Phase 3 is to enable Open Trip Planner
to identify itineraries that include Flex Ride services, often in combination with fixed route segments.
Flex Ride is not currently offered as an option in Trip Planner. Adding Flex Ride to Open Trip Planner will
enhance the rider’s experience by displaying more options for trip planning all in one application.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
This contract authority increase is to provide additional functionality to Open Trip Planner by including
Flex Ride services. Funding is available in the Finance and Administration’s operations and maintenance
funds.

ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors authorizes the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to
increase the contract authority amount with Cambridge Systematics. (Contract Number
15DJ005) from the current level of $763,728.00 by $300,000 to new total contract amount of
$1,063,728.00.
2. Continue with the existing functionality offered in Open Trip Planner and do not add Flex Ride
services.
3. Proceed with an entirely new procurement. This would take well over a year to procure and
deploy the project.

Resolution Authorizing Refunding of Series
2010A Bonds

CFO/AGM,

Board Meeting Date:

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Resolution”), authorizing the issuance of sales tax
revenue bonds (FasTracks Project) of the Regional Transportation District (Colorado) to refund certain
outstanding FasTrack Bonds; providing for other matters related to such Bonds and the security therefor;
and approving the execution and delivery of certain documents in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management
Task Goal #3 – Ensure Fiscal Sustainability
BACKGROUND
In 2010, RTD issued its Sales Tax Revenue Bonds (FasTracks Project), Series 2010A to partially
finance the West Line, Eagle Project, and termination of interest rate swap agreements. The 2010A
bonds were originally issued in the amount of $79,140,000 and there is currently $76,885,000
remaining outstanding. The Bonds are callable at par on November 1, 2020, the final payment is
scheduled to occur in 2038 and the bonds have a 5.0% coupon.
The approaching call dates and current low interest rate environment have created an opportunity to
refinance the remaining 2010A bonds to realize a reduction in interest expense.
DISCUSSION
RTD has the potential to refund the remaining outstanding Series 2010A bonds to realize, subject to
market conditions, a net present value savings of approximately $15.9 million (20.0% of principal of
refunded) between 2020 and 2038. RTD Board Policy and the Resolution require a minimum of 3%
savings which allows some flexibility in regards to changes in interest rates between now and the date
the new interest rate is locked.
While the potential refunding savings are significant, it is important to note that such savings are net of
a cost resulting from (a) the inability to invest proceeds of the new financing at a return equal to the
interest expense of the new financing, and (b) the length of time between the execution of the new
financing and the November 1, 2020 call date of the 2010A bonds (negative arbitrage). Absent a
change in interest rates, the savings to RTD improves with the passage of time, due to a reduction in

Packet Pg. 51

11.D

time proceeds of the new financing must be invested prior to redeeming the 2010A bonds. Despite the
cost associated with the negative arbitrage, the potential savings from a refunding of the 2010A bonds
exceeds the typical threshold for a refunding by RTD. Consequently, staff has assembled a financing
team and commenced documentation to be in a position to take advantage of the opportunity for RTD to
reduce its interest expense.
The Board is being requested through the Resolution to authorize the refinancing of the Sales Tax
Revenue Bonds (FasTracks Project), Series 2010A with the issuance of tax-exempt bonds through a
forward delivery agreement where the securities would be priced in 2019 but not delivered to the
investors until 2020.
Drafts of documents including the Preliminary Official Statement, Lease Purchase Agreement, Escrow
Agreement, and Forward Delivery Agreement are available for review in the Board Office.
RTD is receiving the advice of Hilltop Securities as independent financial advisors and Butler Snow LLP
as Bond Counsel, in regard to the transaction. The bonds will be sold through an underwriting
syndicate consisting of RBC, Harveston Securities, and Stifel.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Costs associated with the refunding are considered “costs of issuance” and will be funded out of
proceeds from the sale of the bonds. These costs include financial advisory, attorney, rating agency and
miscellaneous costs. The final payment year of the new bonds will not exceed 2038, the final payment
year of the existing Series 2010A bonds that are being refinanced.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Resolution”), authorizing the issuance
of sales tax revenue bonds (FasTracks Project) of the Regional Transportation District (Colorado)
to refund certain outstanding FasTrack Bonds; providing for other matters related to such Bonds
and the security therefor; and approving the execution and delivery of certain documents in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.
2. Do not authorize the execution of documents; including the attached Resolution No.__, Series of
2019 related to the issuance of the RTD Sales Tax Revenue Bonds (FasTracks Project), Series
2020A and related documents in connection with the refinancing of the RTD Sales Tax Revenue
Bonds (Fastracsk Project), Series 2010A. This is not the recommended action as it would not
take advantage of the interest expense savings currently available to the district.

2010A Certificates of Participation

Board Meeting Date:

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Resolution”), authorizing the execution and delivery by
the RTD of a lease purchase agreement and related documents in connection with the refinancing of the
2010A Certificates of Participation (COPs).
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management
Task Goal #3 – Ensure Fiscal Sustainability
BACKGROUND
In 2010, RTD issued its Series 2010A certificates of participation (COPs) to finance 55 new Siemens
light rail vehicles, 95 access-a-Ride vehicles, 32 Call-n-Ride vehicles, fare boxes and CAD/AVL
equipment. The 2010A COPs also refinanced the 1998A and 2001A COPs for interest expense savings.
The 2010A COPs were originally issued in the amount of $312,900,000 and there is currently
$76,885,000 remaining outstanding. The COPs are callable at par on November 1, 2020 and final
payment is scheduled to occur in 2031 and the interest rate being paid ranges from 5.0% - 5.5%.
The approaching call dates and current low interest rate environment have created an opportunity to
refinance the remaining 2010A COPs to realize a reduction in interest expense.
DISSCUSSION
RTD has the potential to refund the remaining outstanding Series 2010A COPs to realize, subject to
market conditions, a present value savings of approximately $14.8 million (19.3% of principal of
refunded COPs) between 2020 and 2031. RTD Board Policy and the Resolution require a minimum of
3% savings which allows some flexibility in regards to changes in interest rates between now and the
date the new interest rate is locked.
While the potential refunding savings are significant, it is important to note that such savings are net of
a cost resulting from (a) the inability to invest proceeds of the new financing at a return equal to the
interest expense of the new financing, and (b) the length of time between the execution of the new
financing and the June 1, 2020 call date of the 2010A COPs (negative arbitrage). Absent a change in
interest rates, the savings to RTD improves with the passage of time, due to a reduction in time
proceeds of the new financing must be invested prior to redeeming the 2010A COPs. Despite the cost

Packet Pg. 70

11.E

associated with the negative arbitrage, the potential savings from a refunding of the 2010A COPs
exceeds the typical threshold for a refunding by RTD. Consequently, staff has assembled a financing
team and commenced documentation to be in a position to take advantage of the opportunity for RTD to
reduce its interest expense.
RTD historically used COPs to finance vehicles and other capital projects when the budget cannot
accommodate the use of cash to fund the necessary vehicles and projects, as was the case in 2010.
The Board is being requested through the Resolution to authorize the refinancing of the Series 2010A
COPs with the issuance of tax-exempt COPs through a forward delivery agreement where the securities
would be priced in 2019 but not delivered to the investors until 2020.
Drafts of documents including the Preliminary Official Statement, Lease Purchase Agreement, Escrow
Agreement, Forward Delivery Agreement are available for review in the Board Office.
RTD is receiving the advice of Hilltop Securities as independent financial advisors and Butler Snow LLP
as Bond Counsel, in regard to the transaction. The COP’s will be sold through an underwriting syndicate
consisting of JP Morgan, Harveston Securities and Jefferies.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Costs associated with the refunding are considered “costs of issuance” and will be funded out of
proceeds from the sale of the COPs. These costs include financial advisory, attorney, rating agency and
miscellaneous costs. The final payment year of the new COPs will not exceed 2031, the final payment
year of the existing Series 2010A COPs that are being refinanced.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Resolution”), authorizing the
execution and delivery by the RTD of a lease purchase agreement and related documents in
connection with the refinancing of the 2010A Certificates of Participation (COPs).
2. Do not authorize the execution of documents; including the attached Resolution No.__, Series of
2019 related to the refinancing of the Series 2010A RTD Certificates of Participation and related
documents in connection with the refinancing of the 2010A certificates of participation. This is
not the recommended action as it would not take advantage of the interest expense savings
currently available to the district.

January 2020 Service Changes

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the January 2020 Service Change package as revised and summarized in Attachment A
resulting in an annualized base system cost of $519,000 and, further, to authorize the General Manager
or his designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is
impacted by these changes
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services
Task Goal #1 – Fiscal Sustainability
DISCUSSION
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. We will continue adjusting services in
response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. It is also
our responsibility to identify services that are underperforming and recommend modifications,
curtailment or cancellation of service as warranted or recommend new service as changes in the
community warrant and finances allow.
The proposals herein include a mix of service improvements, adjustments and reductions.
The grant for service on the Route 62 – Commerce City/Dick’s SG Park expires in December 2019 and
due to its low ridership performance, it is proposed for cancellation. With the expiration of grant funding
for expanded service on the Route LD, it is proposed that the Route LD be returned to its pre-grant level
of service. Additionally, a number of service changes aimed at increasing on-time performance and
service reliability are included in these proposals. We will monitor customer response to the
implementation of these service changes and propose adjustments and service alternatives as
appropriate in future service change recommendations.
The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
 Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
 Response to changes in the communities where services are provided

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The overall financial impact contained in this proposal includes a base system cost of approximately

EQUITY ANALYSIS
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and
Executive Order 12898 regarding Environmental Justice. In this circular, the FTA requires RTD to
evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that exceed the established major service
change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a disproportionately negative impact on
minority or low-income populations. Our evaluation of the proposed January 2020 service changes has
found no disparate impacts.

LD3 would provide service between 8th & Coffman PnR and US36 & Broomfield Station
with 60 minute midday and evening service and 120 minute headway frequency on
Saturday.
Route LX1/LX2 – Longmont/Denver
Regional - (10% 11.3 pass. per hr./ 25% - 21.9 pass per hr.)

Carl Crosswhite had signed up to comment, but initially declined to comment. He later
inquired as to the status of the destroyed shelter at US36 & Broomfield Station, and when
a replacement would be installed.
Francie Crosswhite stated that she appreciated the service provided by the LD. She also
stated that she hopes the LD1 does not go away in the future.
Jeff Zumfelde had signed up to comment, but had departed the meeting prior to the meeting
opening for comments. He had his questions addressed by Nataly prior to the presentation.
Elizabeth Dickinson claimed that the 30 minute combined frequency provided by the LD1
and LD2 would be inadequate as they service different stops in Lafayette. She stated that,
if she were to miss an LD1 in Lafayette, she would need to wait an hour for the next bus,
as the LD2 does not service the same stops. Elizabeth stated that many of the LD commuters
may switch to US36 & Flatiron Station because of the 60 minute frequency of the LD1. She
also argued that the taxes levied on Lafayette residents were unfair as they have continually
have service cut in their area. H
Hiram Wolgemuth had signed up to comment, but declined to comment.
Ian Kelly Voiced support for the initial proposal for the LD1 put forth by Boulder County. He
argued that the LD1 should be rerouted to service the apartment complexes south of
Lafayette Park n Ride/north of Exempla. He also argued for another southbound route from
Lafayette to the US36 corridor. e later asked for clarification about how RTD works together
with local organizations to determine service.
Joan Santon stated that it is a disservice that Lafayette only has as much service as it
currently does. She claims that she always sees empty buses on other routes, and wonders
why RTD keeps threatening to cut the LD. She asked whether there are any other routes
which are grant-funded in the RTD system. She also wondered why rail lines keep opening
without any service being provided to Lafayette. She later asked how she could get in
contact with her local officials.
Sondra Bland seconded Joan’s point regarding FasTracks and rail lines continuing to be
funded without Lafayette receiving any service. She claimed that the LD is unreliable
because, if she misses one, she will have to wait for far too long, especially in inclement
weather. She claims that people will simply end up driving across Boulder County to catch
another bus (the FF). She also stated that she has heard RTD drivers mentioning the fact
that they hate driving the LD.

Helen Bushnell questioned whether drivers are being sufficiently trained to drive the LD. She
claimed RTD’s public outreach to notify riders of potential service changes is subpar, as it
doesn’t reach enough people. The complimented the proposed LD3, and liked that it
connects Longmont, Lafayette, and Broomfield. She also claimed that it is difficult to grow
ridership when buses like the LD are always leaving early. She later followed this up by
claiming the Commuting Solutions and other TMOs in the areas work exclusively to get
subsidies for white/rich/middle class/9-5 workers, rather than reaching out to poorer
communities. She claims that RTD should do a better job by provide equity in their public
outreach.
Sarah Barnes stated that it would be great to focus more on driver training, as some of them
don’t know their routes.
Stephanie Welton voiced support for the Boulder County proposal. She also stated that
dealing with our customer service department is frustrating, and claims that there appears
to be a disconnect in RTD between the data though which decisions are made and the
communication to the public. She later clarified part of a question posed by Ian Kelly,
explaining that RTD not only works with local organizations, but works with counties, cities,
and regional organizations as well.
Devon McCune stated his support for a mid-day option to Union Station. He claims that
having to connect from the LD3 to the FF at US36 & Broomfield Station adds lots of
commuting time and, with inclement weather and long walks, is a major inconvenience for
passengers.

Louis Burkhardt said that he would love a bus from Lafayette Park n Ride to US 36 &
Broomfield Station on Sundays. He also argued that drivers need more training about the
fare zones on the LD, as he claims that he has been charged the incorrect fare several times.
He states that he uses a MyRide card, and often has to convince drivers that a fare is local
rather than regional. It is inconvenient for him to consistently contest his fares with either
the drivers or with RTD administrative staff.

in attendance - Scott McCarey with Boulder County, Alex Hyde-Wright with Boulder County,
Jeff Butts with Boulder County, and Phil Greenwald with the City of Longmont. There were
no RTD board members in attendance.
Andrea Kaumann claimed that she repeatedly hears RTD claim that there’s not enough
ridership after 5:45pm for more LX service, and compared the situation to a chicken/egg
scenario, and that, if RTD were to actually provide the service, more people would rider it.
She argued the same is true for early morning LX trips, and suggested that RTD should pilot
the service to see what the results would be. She requested an LD or LX to leave from/go
to Civic Center. She later asked how she could provide a suggestion or advocate for a
specific route change, apart from in the public meeting format.
Rolf Kaumann echoed Andrea’s requests for earlier/later LX service and trips on the LD/LX
to/from Civic Center. He asked if there was any way we could build flexibility into our
courtesy hold policy, as he claimed that, whenever he takes local buses to connect to
regional service (or vice versa), he often misses his connections. He claimed this is a major
inconvenience for passengers, especially in inclement weather. He later asked whether RTD
was still on track to implement B Line service by 2040.
Jennifer Record stated her desire for all LX2 trips to go to 23rd & Main in Longmont. She
stated that RTD could work together with companies who provide ecopasses in order to
better notify riders of upcoming service change hearings. She claims that all of the
connections necessitated by the LD3 make the trip too long, and that an LX2 trip after
5:45pm would be helpful for commuters with their loss of direct LD service during the day.
Karen Vent showed up late and required Jessie to provide the presentation to her separately.
She provided written comments, stating that Lafayette PnR needs a stop for the LD3, and
she requested Sunday service to Broomfield.
Thomas Gilbertz asked whether the 324 would be expanded to provide later service. He also
submitted written comment stating the following: “I get off of work at 10pm. As a cook it
is a crunch to catch your bus. Friday Saturday, and Sunday, I cannot even use RTD and
driving to Denver on 36 or I-25 scares me. I know ridership is down at 10pm but a two hour
commute makes me want to leave my community. If I must make a connection, allow 15
minutes between the FF1 arriving at Broomfield and the LD3 departing. Please consider the
LD3 running until 12:15am on Friday and Sunday. Consider LD3 on Sunday. Please and
thank you.
Colleen Elrod asked why RTD can’t push out service change information further ahead of
time. She states that many riders don’t even know that meetings occur, and plenty of people
who could potentially provide feedback are absent due to the poor outreach. She asked if
the additional 2:30 pm LX trip was mainly due to the students, or if it was a year-round
issue. She asked if FF frequency will be increased. She stated that, if passengers are waiting
for an hour for the LD3 at Broomfield, the shelters in place are inadequate, especially in the

event of inclement weather. She concluded by stating that when RTD bolstered LD service
in 2016, Longmont was happy, and she now feels as though Longmont is “getting the
shaft.”

Jenn Stoelzel stated her support for an LX trip going to Civic Center, as she often misses
her transfer at Union Station. She later provided written comment, stating the following: “I
would like to propose a new route from Longmont to Civic Center Station. I tend to miss
my LX bus because of traffic on the Metro Ride, so having a route from Civic Center or later
LX buses would be great. I also think mid-day times from Union to Longmont are needed as
life is unpredictable and the need to go home early may arise. The new LX2 at 2:30pm
should go all the way to 23rd & Main as many riders park up at that stop.”
John Harris claimed that he considers midday service a “safety backup” as he sometimes
has to go home early, and would appreciate having direct service back to Longmont from
Denver. He stated his support for another LX in the late morning, as well as for an LX2 trip
to go to Civic Center. He concluded by asking whether it makes sense to still commit to B
Line service to Boulder, or to fully fund and improve the bus service along US 36.

Kevin Mooney wanted to know about the LD changes since he lives in Lafayette, especially
the new LD3 information and how it would compare to 225 routing. He later wondered if
there were any plans to add a new stop on the LD on Boulder Road. He was also concerned
about the condition of the Lafayette Park-n-ride, citing current construction has caused falls
and injuries. He inquired about the availability of restrooms at RTD facilities for persons with
disabilities and asked how the new restroom doors were working in Union Station. Staff
addressed his LD questions and offered to connect him with maintenance staff regarding his
other concerns. He shared that he recently observed someone with a camera (video camera)
filming passengers at the Alameda Station running to catch the bus and wondered if staff
knew what that was about. He later asked if there were any plans to add Wi-Fi to RTD
vehicles, especially regional routes. He also wondered about the new Bustang service to
Estes Park and where he could get more information about that. He expressed concern that
the shelter boards are not always current, and another LD rider confirmed that this is
consistently an issue.
Dorothy Smith was very concerned about the August service changes that had gone into
effect and said they were a complete mess. Was particularly concerned about the route 72
and how long it takes, that it goes through the neighborhood, and how there is an insufficient
sidewalk network to connect to the bus stops. Stated that connections between the 72 and

D. Martinez mentioned that he has been riding RTD for 34 years and has had a good
experience so far. Was very concerned and shocked to hear of RTDs financial situation and
budget deficit that was recently highlighted in the news. Had questions about the specific
route 1 proposed changes as that is a route he frequents. Staff explained that there would
be minor running time adjustments and explained what that meant. He then mentioned that
there were two stops along the route where buses have trouble getting from the stop, over
across several lanes of traffic to make the required turn - westbound at Leetsdale and
eastbound the stop before they need to turn onto Colorado Blvd. He later asked for more
information regarding the recent reports of the cancelled light rail trips due to a shortage of
operators. He also inquired about who was responsible for putting up signs directing people
to Park-n-Rides as he recently had a lot of difficulty locating the Parker Park-n-Ride. Staff
said they would follow-up to see what could be done.
Desiree Jones wanted to know if there was a way to make safer bus connections as she
feels she and others often have to run across traffic to catch their connecting bus. Staff
mentioned that you could ask your bus driver to contact dispatch to see if the connecting
bus could do a courtesy wait to ensure a successful transfer. She later asked who she could
talk to in order to make sure her local King Sooper’s is stocked with RTD passes (especially
the monthly ones) in time, at the beginning of the month when she needs it. Staff said they
would follow-up to see what could be done.
John Lake expressed concern about not being able to get the attention of the bus driver
once on the bus. Staff expressed that for safety reasons the operator needs to be focused
on driving and the safest time to talk to the driver/ask them questions is when boarding. He
also wondered if the N Line was supposed to go to Longmont and if it was going to open in
2066. Staff explained that he must be confusing the N Line and the proposed Northwest
rail line and explained the differences.
Arthur Murray came late and also wanted to know the details of the LD changes. Staff again
explained the proposal. He then wanted to know what the plans were for the Northwest rail
line as he is a resident of Longmont and has been paying taxes on several properties and
feels that he therefore has significantly contributed to the building and completion of 5 lines
that he is not served by and if there was a way he might be able to be repaid. Staff explained
that that was beyond the scope of the meeting, but that we could connect them to long
range planning and that a similar question has been posed to the state of Colorado at a
legislative level. He also wondered if there was any plan to have the Longmont routes go
directly to Civic Center, since so many other regional routes do. Staff responded that while
there are no current plans to do that, staff is looking at it very closely to see how that might
be possible and additionally, Denver is currently optimizing signal timing so that RTDs free
shuttles could provide faster connections from Union Station.

changes and quickly exited.

11.F.b

Adino – Concerns with elimination. Concerns with people who can’t speak English, buses
aren’t current on their schedules, all RTD departments are saying different times. Concerns
with bus stops being taken away when new people move to town ex. 12th Ave on the 10
– stops were eliminated to get there faster, people now have to walk a further distance,
RTD is down bus service and bus riders. Forced on to crammed trains, trains were sitting
on the tracks and people were crammed into the trains, why were trains sitting on the rails
not being used when they should be in service? Go get somewhere you have to take multiple
transfers when trying to get somewhere. Need more consistency to keep ridership up.
Removing stops doesn’t help. Public attitude towards the drivers is changing, bus drivers
aren’t waiting for people, some don’t open up doors, some don’t look in their mirrors to wait
for people running for the bus. Times are changed throughout the day, not consistent, ex:
:39, :09, :39 then :42, :12 etc. this doesn’t create consistency and should be every day of
the week. Transfer connections, from train to a bus, the bus is taking off when people need
to make a connection. Power outage – shuttle buses picked people up and dropped off at
University station and no light rail showed up and empty buses sat there when they could
have gone downtown. There were 12 empty buses.
Jonathan Detogo – Commend eliminations of bus stops on Route 24, losing frequency
because stops are a block apart. Route 15L (changes) were also good. Go further with
eliminations in downtown. There is one route where you just turn the block and then there’s
another stop after just stopping. Go further with 15 15L and 20.
Shaina – Agree with Adino on some comments and with Jonathan. When the bus gets
downtown there should be fewer stops and let the bus get there faster. Biking is faster
sometimes. Less stops downtown is ideal. Know what the true bus schedule is essential.
For the buses it should be up to date.
Kim Young - Agree with some of the comments made, understand the drivers are doing
what they can, trying to get through on the call system is a joke, an operators don’t have
any resources for when a person doesn’t pay or if there’s a problem. Usually they have to
call the police or 911. On the Mall Ride, seems to be inefficiently managed, people trying to
run for the bus, even when someone touches the bus. Appreciate the frequency. Why do
they all bunch up and not wait until busses are split evenly. Sunday 15 Sept - There have
been service outages, and the buses couldn’t keep up but doesn’t seem any different than
when operations are ok. 5 trains simply didn’t show up. 28 didn’t show up and there is
nothing on Next Ride to tell her that and she doesn’t know how long she’s going to be there.
Annie – Light Rail GTFS times don’t match up with schedules.
Matt Brady – Security and operators supposed to check correct fare is paid, whether cash,
eco pass, student fare, some people under senior citizen age, who look younger, are paying

Roger Messenger – RTD could use some cheerleaders and could use some constructive
criticism. Lives in Elizabeth but the area he lives in doesn’t have service but people drive to
the district to catch some trains or buses. Are any bathrooms proposed at stations, and if
so where? Some people need to use the bathrooms. Are any changes proposed because of
operator shortage? Are there going to be any bike lockers at the stations so people can ride
there to catch the train? Maybe for the women there could be better security at the stops
and stations.
Paolo Solazano– On time performance, 86% for local, 121 is somewhere around 55% which
is 5 minutes or more, it’s either late sometimes by 12 minutes. Not convenient and seems
to happen quite often. LCD signs are out, would be helpful for when the bus is late, the
Colorado Station is out for over a year. Google-real time data is not tracking correctly.
Chris Humphreys – Complaint got on the bus at 15L at 4:45 tonight, got on at Colfax and
Yosemite. It is never on time and neither is the 15. Operators don’t pass one another and
they should. Had to take two buses to get to downtown in the morning and then 3 buses in

front of the building, can’t go up the stairs or the ramp, no service on the weekend. Rt 3 Bus stops at the Jewish center instead over by Filmore, Trouble with a driver (Clinton) who
is mean and only follows the rules and does only by the rules. No wheelchair can’t go up
the ramp because it’s too steep. Flexride isn’t on time and then riders miss appts. Stops
have been eliminated and senior citizens can’t get to the stops. Trains on the weekends too
many shuttles. Route 24 – waiting and bus never showed up at cherry creek area. Bus
operator on Downing passed right by and didn’t even stop. Yale station – what can be done
to improve service in that area? Security on the 31 buses is needed.

machines at the platforms, one of the machines has been out of service for a while, been
that way for a long time. Only one is operating, what happens when that one goes wrong?
People will then just walk on the light rail. Figuring out what numbers to hit and all the
prompts was confusing and somehow was charged and overpaid. Even the security guy

Hope your day is going well! I recently learned that RTD
is considering eliminating the Adams and Ellsworth stop
on Route 3. I would like to speak in favor of keeping the
stop for the following reasons:
1) Moving the stop to Steele St would be dangerous for
the seniors living in the Kovod Assisted Living building.
These residents would need to cross the busy Steele St
traffic where the signals are not very long. The
neighborhood street the stop is currently on is in a high
density neighborhood and is a shorter distance for those
residents.
2) The speed of traffic would be slowed on Steele street.
This would increase congestion around the Cherry Creek
mall. Where the stop is now, it isn’t as busy and doesn’t
affect traffic flow in the area.
Please consider keeping the stop on Route 3 at Ellsworth
and Adams. Thank you for your considerations and
feedback.

I would like to comment regarding the route 37 service.
I did not find this particular service change proposed,
however I have a change I would like to propose for this
route. What I am proposing and pushing for today is
extending the "morning rush" frequency of every 30
minutes by one additional trip westbound. Currently
after 8:30 AM the rt 37 operates hourly westbound from
40th/Airport. I propose adding a 9 AM departure
westbound from 40th/Airport. Currently the driver of
the eastbound trip departing 40th/Colorado at 8:03 AM
pulls into the garage after arriving 40th/Airport at 8:57
AM. I believe the addition of a 9 AM departure could be
accomplished fairly easily by having this driver departing
9 AM on a westbound trip instead of pulling in.
Thank you for your consideration. Please feel free to
contact me if you wish.

I’m requesting that you DON’T eliminate the bus stops
along East Yale (why not also list the bus stop numbers
in the change notice?). These are along a major
shopping center and those stops are very helpful when
carrying bags or using a shopping cart. It makes a
difference to have a stop nearby. Also I know a rider who
has been using a walker and he gets off at the Yale/Ash
stop—he takes the bus to shop and to go to the gym for
rehab.
In general, I don’t think eliminating stops is the best path
to service. It may make the trip quicker but it makes it
more difficult for many people to walk further to the
next stop. Even I don’t always go some places that I used
to because it’s not as easy to get to them anymore. You
may not have the data but I’m sure it affects businesses.

have been using it every week and our only other option
is the Jump which we'd have to pick up more than a mile

years and instead of getting more service via that

If you want to even out the ridership between the LX and
he LD routes, the LD2 buses should go from Longmont to
the Civic Center Station. About half of the people that
take the LX and LD to Denver each morning will go
straight to the FreeMetro Ride or the Mall Shuttle to get
to the other side of the 16th street mall, all those people
will gladly switch to the LD if it came to the Civic Center
instead of Union Station. It would save commuters 15-25
minutes each way to and from Civic Station and Union
Station, probably an average of 40 minutes per day with
that single change. Same logic that was applied to the
FF4 route to Boulder.
The LD routes should be funded permanently. Longmont
does not get anything in comparison to other cities in
your districts, local service is almost non-existent, so the
least that we could have are options for commuting to
Denver. Specially considering none of us in Longmont
will get the light rail in our useful working lives, having
the LX and LD options, in addition to an option to go
directly to the Civic Center Station is the best thing RTD
can do for Longmont.

Hello, I am writing to voice my opposition to the
proposed service changes, particularly those in
Longmont.
As a single working mom, putting a kid through college, I
rely on RTD to get me to and from my job. Earlier this
year I was facing a serious health issue and I had doctor's
appointments every day for 4 weeks. I scheduled my
appointments for early mornings and late afternoons,
but still needed to leave work at 2 pm or arrive at noon
to get to and from my appointments . If RTD did not have
the mid-day service to and from Longmont, I would have
had to drive to work, using gas (adding to our air quality
problem), wear and tear on my car, and pay for parking
in Downtown Denver to the tune of $15 a day or more. I
already pay $200 a month for my monthly bus

There are more people moving to the area every
day. We need more busses, not fewer. Students
attending Metro and CU Denver use the mid-day
busses. Working people who work off-hours use the
mid-day busses. RTD cites low ridership as one of the
reasons for eliminating the mid-day service. However,
every time I take a mid-day bus, there are several other
riders. Perhaps RTD could use smaller busses for those
times. I believe that these changes would cause more
people to drive, adding to the already horrible traffic
problem, that is getting worse all the time.

I am writing today to urge you NOT to make changes to
mid-day trips from Longmont to Denver. I understand
you now want Longmont taxpayers and riders to transfer
in Broomfield. Direct service to Denver is very important
to many of us bus riders and now you want to make the
trip more time-consuming and inconvenient.
RTD has cut service in Longmont numerous
times. Please LISTEN to your customers and keep the
current service level and direct routes to Denver.
In light of not building our rail line, I would have guessed
that RTD would want to try to help Longmont increase
our mobility in other ways. Instead, you make things
even more difficult for us.

Please re consider deleting the bus service from Denver
to Longmont on the LD. I work near Civic Center at 1740
Broadway if I work until 5:30 PM I have no way to be able
to catch the last LX2 at 5:45. Even leave a few minutes
after 5 pm with traffic it is hard to get across town using
the Free Metro shuttles by that time. I currently ride the
LD at either 6pm or 6:30pm once or twice a week. The
new recommendation I will have to go to Boulder and
then from Boulder to Longmont. After an already long
day I don’t want to spend two hours on a bus. In the
documentation about changes it is suggested that
ridership is down. I am not sure what busses this would
be as ALL the Longmont busses I take seem to be getting
more ridership. If you want to delete the LD then please
add at least one or two LX routes past 5:45. It would be
awesome to have a late LX1 around 6:20!!!
I am not alone when I get off the bus at 8PM at 23rd and

I bus from north Longmont (23rd & Main) and work near
Civic Center Station. I take the LX1 downtown and return
on LX2 due to scheduling. I am often forced to drive if I
have to work even a few minutes past 5pm as the last
express bus from Union Station leaves at 5:45. If I walk
out of my building at 5pm, it can often take to long for
me to get to Union Station on the shuttle (due to Rockies

As you are the Lead Service Planner & Schedule for the
Northern routes, please accept this email as my
vehement opposition to the proposed service cuts for
the LD routes! I am outraged! The additional time added
to the (already) time-consuming LD commute, along with
the increased risk/danger to passengers having to
transfer at a Broomfield station, is completely
unacceptable. We (Longmont) do not have our rail, and
now we're told that our our LD bus service is going
discontinued.
I've been dependent upon, and supportive of RTD route
for over 15 years. Though I mainly commute during peak
hours, it is relatively often that I need to utilize the LD
routes with a late morning commute; early in the
afternoon, or even late into the evening.
Many frustrating (if not dangerous) scenarios come to
mind with this proposed change. For example, evening
commuters risk being stranded overnight at an
Broomfield stop if the FF is behind schedule and a rider
misses the last connection to Longmont. Even if one
doesn't miss the connection, a rider could be forced to
wait at an outdoor stop in Broomfield for up to an hour.
This could be in darkness, and/or in the cold of winter.
This increased risk to personal safety alone, is
unacceptable.

I also think of the many riders who do not drive at all.
Currently, they must coordinate a Longmont City route
with an LD route. As of January, they will have to also
add a coordinating stop with an FF route. This can easily
turn one-way of their Longmont-Denver commute into 2
hours!
I do take note that all fingers are pointing to a Grant that

Packet Pg. 104

will expire, as the culprit. If this is true, I must ask why it
was not pursued beyond 2018? Who would be
responsible for pursuing this Grant? Why would RTD
allow this to happen, even if not their responsibility?
Why are we only hearing of this now? Does RTD not have
any concern for their Longmont community??!
I understand the staffing issues that RTD has been
plagued with, as you and I have discussed at prior
Longmont RTD meetings. However, it seems increasingly
apparent that Longmont (and all of the NW Boulder
County area) continues to be the target of RTD
reductions, yet we continue to pay the same in fares and
taxes for the vanishing service.
Please share this with your peers at RTD, as I'm not
aware of everyone who is involved in this (atrocious)
decision -making process. Also, if you have Judy Lubow's
email address, please share it with me. The link to her
email on the RTD site, will not work for me.

I must ask that RTD takes a long and hard look about the
elimination of the LD line going into Denver. Longmont
only has a few express buses to take us to Denver and
back home. Now it is being proposed to take more routes
from us. I would be fine with deleting the LDs if you were
adding some more LXs. Many nights I have to work late
and take the LD at 6:30PM or even the 7:30. This doesn’t
put me home until 8 or 9 PM. With the proposed changes
I can assume it would even be longer and I would have
to take two or three busses to get home. It is not safe for
a woman to be waiting in the dark for busses. Longmont
put up a lot of money to keep RTD running between
Denver and Longmont and RTD is talking about canceling
our service. This doesn’t seem fair. Many of the
Longmont riders will probably stop riding in January
between the price hikes and eliminating our service.
PLEASE I AM BAGGING PLEASE DON’T TAKE OUR BUSSES.

I am writing to provide comments on the proposed LD
route changes for January 2019. The proposal to
discontinue direct service to Denver Union Station will
sever Longmont's access to the RTD network and make
an already long trip completely prohibitive on public
transit. Today, when I ride an LD1 or LD2 bus, the
overwhelming majority of customers boarding/exiting
along 287 are riding the bus to/from Union Station. By
forcing these customers to now take a much longer route
and add a change of bus, it now is easier to simply drive
to Denver and puts more cars on area roads.
I am extremely disappointed in RTD's proposal and feel
that it does not serve the community of Longmont.
Personally, this change will force me to abandon taking
the LD route into downtown and limit the times I can
even use the LX buses during commute hours since I
often need to take an LD bus one-way due to already
limited schedules.

The LD buses that come out of Union Station in the
afternoon between 4:15, 4:20, 4:56, 5:16 and 5:31 are
usually always crowded. Some of them may not be
completely full, but neither are the Boulder FF buses. I
know because I also go down to Boulder from time to
time.
I’ve taken McCaslin buses in the morning on occasion,
and they come every 8-10 minutes and are not always
crowded, maybe one person per double seat.
I find RTDs proposal to eliminate the LDs that takes
passengers from Lafayette straight to Union Station very
disturbing to say the least. It will require all people to
change buses at least once, if not twice, when service has
been seamless. It will greatly increase commuting time
for many, many people, and force a lot of us to begin
driving to other PNRs to get straight bus service from
point A to point B. Currently, I walk to one of the stops
along 287 and now will have to consider driving 4-5 miles
to get to McCaslin PNR to make it to work on time,
thereby defeating the purpose of taking mass transit and
keeping extra cars off of the roadway.
If the LD did not exist, I would never have accepted
employment commuting down to Denver. It is too
congested on the roadways and expensive to drive and
park. I have been taking the L to and from Denver every
weekday for the past 10 years. The direct trip down to
Union Station on one bus makes it convenient. I cannot
see supporting RTD with my tax dollars if direct service is
not continued. It seems that RTD could continue direct
service to and from Longmont/Lafayette/Denver at least
during rush hour.
Those buses are crowded.
The Flatiron bus service doesn't start until 6 am in the
morning. A lot of us need a bus prior to that time.
Perhaps the L could eliminate one of the bus between 56 am and fill those buses, make other adjustments to the
schedule and eliminate so many buses on Saturday.

Please don't end the LD1/LD2 bus route. At a time when
metro denver traffic is getting worse, at a time when we
need to be expanding public transportation (for many
reasons including helping the climate), at a time when
cities like Lafayette and Longmont are growing and
Denver is adding jobs, now is not the time to cut these
lines. It's the time to expand and try to add new riders.
These routes are used and needed by many people.
Ending these lines will hurt RTD more by forcing people
to find alternative (non RTD) means of transportation.
More people will be lost than those who will deal with
the bus transfer(s). RTD should be expanding service and
making it easier for people to ride. RTD should be trying
to grow and not shrink. We can't just keep cutting service
and hoping that things will get better. Boulder county
needs this route and I am sure I am not alone in saying,
please keep this route.

How many different ways are you going to find to screw
Longmont and it’s residents? First, you fail to live up to
your promise to the community on Northwest Rail. Now,
you’re cutting our city’s direct service to Denver in more
than half. It’s absolutely wrong. If I were the City, this
would be the final straw in our relationship. But, I’m not
the city. I’m a CU Denver student who relies on the LD1
and LD2 for reliable transportation to get to class on
time. Without the 9:26 and 1:01 LD on
Tuesday/Thursday I wouldn’t be able to make it to class
those days. You say it’s a ridership issue. But, my LD
busses consistently are at least 50% full, even I non-peak
hours. That’s better than lots of routes you aren’t
threatening. Yet, because this is a Longmont-centric
Route, you want it gone. It’s really shameful. Essentially
ending non-peak hour direct service between Denver
and Longmont hurts RTD’s perception in our community
and hurts RTD’s long-term bottom line. Please retain the
LD1 and LD2 direct service between Denver and Union
Station.

I’m not usually in favor of changes that add a transfer,
because it can intimidate newbie bus riders. But after
hearing the explanation of the proposed changes, I’m a
bit sad they got delayed. It sounded like they were faster,
more frequent, and cheaper, which is a hard
combination to hit! And both “faster” and “more
frequent” helps a route appeal to newbies. I was very
impressed with the solution overall, it seemed like not
only a cost-saving measure, but a genuine improvement
in service. I know you folks probably can’t endorse any
specific initiatives, but I’ll be on the lookout for ballot
measures that increase RTD’s funding. I’m pleased with
how efficiently my tax dollars are being spent, and it
sounds like having a bigger pool for driver/mechanic

I appose the cancellation of LD1 and LD2. I live in Old
Town Erie and catch the LD2 @ Diamond and 287 in the
morning to get to work @ 16th and Larimer and return
by the LD1 or LD2 after work. Canceling these routes
would create great hardship for my self and many other
bus riders. There are many passengers that get on or off
through out Lafayette. The 7:33 LD 2 at Diamond and 287
in the morning typically has 8+ riders that get on there.
I know people that would like to take the bus if there
were more time options in the morning and evening.
One specifically would be getting to Denver before 8am.
I hope you take this in to consideration and NOT cancel
the route.
I work in downtown Denver and am a frequent rider of
the LX1/2 lines. There are times when I cannot make the
last LX bus leaving at 5:45 P.M. from Union Station and
am forced to take the LD line back to Longmont. Despite
the low ridership of the LD lines it is the only option I
have going from Union Station/ Work to Longmont/
Home. I don't drive and don't own a car so I depend on
the Longmont/ Denver routes on a daily basis, to include
Saturdays. Adding an additional line (the 225) would add
to my already lengthy commute. In my opinion the
Longmont/ Denver routes should not be changed at all.
As a rider I do see how many people ride and depend on
all the LD and LX routes on a daily basis and these
changes would effect the riders negatively. Longmont is
the only city that have limited bus lines to and from the
city unlike Boulder or Denver. If lines are cut or changed
it may require riders to move to a place that has better
bus service outside of Longmont itself.
I am disappointed to hear that you're considering
reducing service between Longmont and Denver!
Longmont needs MORE transit, especially to Boulder and
Denver - cutting back this service is the wrong choice!

To RTD regarding proposed service changes to Route LD1
and LD2. As more commuters travel from the Longmont
area to Downtown Denver for work and school, it is
important to have several public transportation options.
Unfortunately, light rail has not been established in
Longmont; therefore, commuters must rely on RTD
Regional Routes to get to Downtown Denver and back.
The LD Southbound Routes are very important to
morning commuters when the LX Route does not run.
The LD Northbound Routes are very important during
the afternoon commute back to Longmont. If a situation
is happening along I-25, many riders choose to avoid the
area (avoid the LX) and take the LD routes. Also, the final
LX route is at 5:45 pm, whereas the LD has several later
options. Additionally, the LX Northbound Routes seem
to be at or near capacity during the afternoon rush hour.
It would be very beneficial to add additional northbound
rush hour LX routes if the proposed changes are
implemented.

Attachment: January 2020 Attachment B public comment (3971 : January 2020 Service Changes)

In conclusion, my feedback is the proposed service

I understand that the proposed change to the above
routes is that they will end at the Broomfield exit. Here
are my Comments: I take the bus to Denver every day
and have gotten off at Broomfield several times to catch
a FFlyer to Denver. They are always packed and I’ve had
to stand each time. So I no longer attempt to catch a
FFlyer. If you discontinue the bus as is I will have to take
3 buses to work. From Lafayette to Broomfield to Union
Station and then hop on the Metro Ride. The ride home
will be very inconvenient. I will have to get off the bus at
Broomfield and cross over the bridge to catch a LDI or
LD2.. It’s going to extend the length of time it takes me
to get home in addition to being out in the elements for
longer periods of time both coming and going to work.
In bad weather I already am at an unprotected bus stop.
Longmont/Lafayette LD1/LD2 always seems to be the
ugly stepchild. In recent years they finally adjusted the
schedules so that both of these routes stop along 287
and Empire Road and have more than just three
Saturday buses. There is still no service on Sundays. I
propose that the routes stay as they are.

I commute from Broomfield to Denver each weekday,
and I purchase a $171 monthly pass every month. I
understand the logic of eliminating the LD routes south
of US-36 as these duplicate FF routes. This will require
me to transfer at Broomfield station, but I think that is
reasonable. My concern, however is the proposed
decrease in frequency of 225 (which will be renamed
LD3). Today during rush-hour, either an LD bus or 225
stops at 287 & 10th Ave (which is where I live) every 15
to 20 minutes. The proposed changes indicate that 225's
frequency will be every 60 minutes. This change in
frequency in addition to the transfer required at
Broomfield station, will have a significant negative
impact on my commute next year. If at all possible
please increase the frequency of the 225 (which will be

Station since February of 2007. I have had both knee
replacements which now need to be replaced again, as
well as needing a hip replacement. The LD1, LD2 and LX
buses have given me mobility to keep my job in Denver.
(Why we ended up with LD1 and LD2 busses has been a
mystery to me. It seemed to run smooth and fine with
just L and LX buses.) The complete removal of the LD1
and LD2 busses south of US36 will only bring me hardship
and exposure waiting in the weather elements. This not
only affects me but and all the other disabled people,
both those unstable in their walking gait, a blind
gentleman and others with vision problems that ride,
and those that are wheel chair confined. Our winter

It is my understanding that either going south or north (I
am not sure at this time) that there will be some tunnel
I will have to walk through under US36 to get to the other
side of US36 to get on another bus? This could put me
at risk of injury, and even the possibility of not being able
to get to my job.
The suggestion of using the FF buses will be a joke,
particularly when there are sports events in downtown
Denver. Tell me it is not so that there are often times FF
buses that have only standing room only? I am not able
to stand very long, let alone an entire trip. Would you
also propose that I wait again in the weather elements
for the next FF bus that might have a place to sit? I have
been on the LD busses with drivers who have jockeyed
up and helped out the FF bus drivers whose busses were
too full.
Do we even need the LD2 Northbound from Union
Station bus times and the LD2 Southbound to Union
Station bus times? It seems the LD2 travel the same
routes as LD1 except skip a couple of stops along the
way. (Except please consider changing the 10:16 pm
from an LD2 to an LD1.) Whoever dreamed up not
stopping in Lafayette on the last run north must of not
gotten enough sleep the night before making that
decision.
At the same time, why not look at having fewer LD1
Northbound from Union Station bus times and fewer LD1
Southbound to Union Stations. Right now Northbound
to Longmont there are 3:15, 4:15, 4:55, 5:25, 6:01, 6:31,
7:31, 8:31 and 10:16 pm (a total of 9 LD1 runs). Why not
change that to 3:30, 4:30, 5:30, 6:30, 7:30, 8:30 and
10:16 pm (and eliminate 2 of them for a total of 7 LD1
runs)? Look at doing much the same for Southbound
from Longmont to Union Station.
There are many better proposals than what is being
suggested in your brochure on proposed changes.
Please and thanks for considering other means of saving
money for RTD, or at least try a different schedule
eliminating some of the runs and their times first.

weather can be particularly cold blustery weather, and
some years much snow, let alone there be any ice that
may have all of the handicapped such as myself unstable
on our feet or in their wheelchairs.

I oppose the proposed changes for the LD1 route. I am a
single mother of 2 school age children. We are
dependent on the LD1 bus route to get my children to
school and for myself to work since we cannot afford a
car. It would bring undue hardship to my family if this
route were to be eliminated. Having to take alternate
routes would mean a longer commute time, less sleep
for my family, longer exposure to the elements which is
definitely a major factor taking into consideration our
climate in Colorado. The LD1 is a very frequently used
route and has multiple users who are handicapped as
well and this would also leave them exposed to the
elements for a prolonged time and longer commutes for
them as well.
An alternative option could possibly be to reduce the
amount of trips instead of completely eliminating the
route and all scheduled times. It would be helpful to
choose these times based off of amount passengers.
Eliminating the LD1 is unfair to the community that lives
in the Lafayette and Longmont areas. Many of the
people who use this route are doing so to commute to
work and or school. It would bring so many people who
are dependent upon public transportation undue
hardship. I have extreme respect for the drivers and
understand the shortage of drivers and appreciate all the
service RTD provides. It would greatly affect and sadden
the Lafayette and Longmont community if the LD1
service were to be discontinued.
Thank you for your time and I hope RTD takes the publics
concerns and needs into consideration.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

Date: October 2, 2019

From:

Pauletta Tonilas, Assistant General Manager,
Communications

GM

Date:

October 1, 2019

Board Meeting Date:

Subject:

Federal Liaison Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Communications and Government Relations Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to enter into a new agreement for Federal
Liaison Services with Squire Patton Boggs, LLC for a three-year contract at a cost of $828,000
($23,000 per month—the same rate as currently being paid) with two one-year options (option year one
at $276,000; option year two at $276,000. The total amount of the five-year contract of $1,380,000
was below staff’s internal cost estimate, and funding for this contract is included in the annual budgets.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #5 – Effective Communications & Community Outreach
BACKGROUND
A solicitation for proposals for Federal Liaison Services was issued on July 30, 2019. The solicitation
was advertised in The Denver Post and Transit Talent. In addition, 13 personal emails were sent to
previous bidders to make sure they were aware of the solicitation. Fourteen entities downloaded the
RFP, and one proposal was received. This solicitation was a Best Value Procurement where technical
factors and cost were all considered. The proposal was evaluated by a five-member evaluation
committee that concurred on the recommendation to approve the Squire Patton Boggs, LLC proposal.
The recommendation of the evaluation committee was subsequently referred to the Communications and
Government Relations Committee on October 8, 2019. The Communications and Government Relations
Committee recommended that Squire Patton Boggs, LLC be offered a new three-year contract with two
one-year options. Squire Patton Boggs has been RTD’s federal lobbyist since 2000 and over the years
has assisted in RTD’s receiving over $3.28 billion in federal grants and loans. In addition to constant
monitoring of Congressional and Executive Branch activities, status reports are issued and special
reports are prepared when required by the Board of Directors or the General Manager.
DISCUSSION
Constant monitoring of federal legislative activities that relate to RTD is required, and RTD’s interests
must be conveyed to appropriate members of Congress, including the Colorado delegation and other key
Congressional committee members. The Squire Patton Boggs team has an excellent rapport with and
respect from the Colorado delegation and serves as a resource for the delegation staff. Most recently
Squire Patton Boggs was instrumental in RTD being awarded $1.03 billion Full Funding Grant Agreement
for the Eagle P3 Project, as well as the Small Starts grant of $92 million for the Southeast Extension
Project.

Packet Pg. 120

12.G

The FAST Act expires on September 20, 2020, so the federal lobbyists will play a key role in
representing RTD’s needs in the next reauthorization bill. With the continued build out of FasTracks, the
lobbyists will need to be especially attentive to potential federal financing options for the unfunded
corridors, and they will monitor discussions and advocate for RTD’s best interests regarding new
reauthorization language. When the bill is enacted, Squire Patton Boggs will play a key role in advising
RTD as to the contents of the bill and monitoring the rule-making process.
In addition to helping with Congressional activities, assistance is also necessary with the Executive
Branch of the federal government, including the Department of Transportation (the Federal Transit
Administration and the Federal Railroad Administration). Squire Patton Boggs will provide guidance and
assistance in applying for and receiving federal funds from the Department of Transportation.
When Board members attend the American Public Transportation Association (APTA) Legislative
Conference in Washington, DC, in March of every year, Squire Patton Boggs works to set appointments
with the Colorado Congressional delegation, as well as with key Hill committee members. As an
example of creating a beneficial trip experience, this past year former Chairman of the House
Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Bill Shuster spoke to the group, and a separate luncheon
was convened with former US Secretary of Transportation Rodney Slater along with Eno Transportation
leaders.
The Denver office of Squire Patton Boggs serves as important advisory role in RTD’s connection to
relevant national personnel and issues. In addition, annually, or as required, meetings with the Board of
Directors are also held.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the General Manager or his designee to enter into a new agreement for Federal Liaison
Services with Squire Patton Boggs, LLC for a three-year contract at a cost of $828,000 ($23,000
per month—the same rate as currently being paid) with two one-year options (option year one at
$276,000; option year two at $276,000. The total amount of the five-year contract of
$1,380,000 was below staff’s internal cost estimate, and funding for this contract is included in
the annual budgets.
2. Continue the current contract on a month-to-month basis, if amenable to the current Contractor
(Squire Patton Boggs LLP). This option is not recommended because long-term continuity and
stability in liaison services are important considerations.
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action and issue a new Request for Proposals (RFP) for Federal
Liaison Services. This option is not recommended because RTD’s RFP process was properly
utilized for this procurement, and the proposal was reviewed and subjected to the evaluation
criteria, resulting in a recommendation from the evaluation committee—pursuant to RTD’s longstanding procurement procedures.

Plan

Date: October 16, 2019
&

GM
Board Meeting Date:

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
adopts the 2020-2025 Mid-term Financial Plan.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management
Task Goal #1 – Fiscal Sustainability
POLICY REFERENCE
Fiscal Policy Statement – Capital Improvement Policies 1 and 7, Budget Policies 13 and 14
BACKGROUND
Capital Improvement Policy 1 of RTD’s 2019 Fiscal Policy Statement states that on an annual basis,
RTD will prepare and update annually a six-year Mid-term Financial Plan including projected capital
construction and improvements, service levels and operating costs, and revenues to fund the capital and
operating programs. Capital Improvement Policy 7 states that RTD will prepare an annual update of the
FasTracks plan which will be integrated with the Base System plan into the Mid-term Financial Plan
incorporating actual costs incurred and the most recent available projections of capital improvement
costs, service levels, and operating costs and revenues to fund the FasTracks capital and operating
programs.
The Mid-term Financial Plan is a six-year financial plan consisting of the Base System and FasTracks.
The Base System MTFP includes only service and projects funded from the Base System 0.6% sales/use
tax, and FasTracks operations activity. The FasTracks MTFP includes expense and projects (nonoperational) funded from the FasTracks 0.4% sales/use tax.
Updated annually, the Mid-term Financial Plan provides important cash flow planning information used to
determine the District’s operating, investing and financing activity as well as services that the District
can provide using projected financial resources. The first year of the Mid-term Financial Plan serves as
the basis for the preparation of the annual budget.
Each year during the planning process, operating costs are estimated and capital projects are developed
to support the goals and objectives of the District. Estimates of other expenditures, such as principal
and interest payments on long-term debt, are also developed as part of the overall costs to the District.
The other major component of the plans is the estimate of available revenues during the six-year time
period. These estimates of costs and revenues are brought together to insure that RTD will have
adequate resources to meet cash flow needs.

Packet Pg. 123

12.H

Per RTD’s Fiscal Policy Statement, RTD will contract with a qualified third party to provide sales and use
tax forecasting containing projections for the short term (annual budget), medium term (Mid-term
Financial Plan) and long term (Financial Plan). RTD has contracted with the University of Colorado-Leeds
School of Business for this service. See “sales and use tax” in Discussion below.
Capital and operating/maintenance projects are evaluated based on their relative costs and benefits,
relative need, and to what extent they meet the RTD mission statement, Transit Asset Management Plan
and State of Good Repair priorities. Projects are constrained to operate within the forecast of revenues
and funding sources available for their completion and operation.
The Mid-term Financial Plan also provides the basis for the District’s application for federal transit
funding through the Transportation Improvement Program (TIP), prepared by the Denver Regional Council
of Governments. The TIP is a list of all roadway and transit projects in the region that receive federal
funding. RTD cannot receive federal funds for projects unless the MTFP qualifying projects are included
in the TIP.
Projected Base and FasTracks future expense and projects for the period 2026-2040 are presented
separately in the Long-Range Financial Plan.
DISCUSSION
Base System
The attached MTFP for the Base System incorporates the 2019 Amended Budget with necessary
adjustments and best estimates at this time. The Base System plan drafts were presented to the
Financial Administration and Audit Committee on May 7th and July 9th for discussion. The final
presentation follows in this document on September 17th with staff recommendation for Board adoption
on September 24th.
Exhibit I
Exhibit I (attached) summarizes the 2020-2025 projected cash flow through the extension of the
2019 Amended Budget. The column titled Forecast Amended Budget 2019 in Exhibit I
incorporates revenue and expense adjustments approved in the Amended Budget.
The Base System plan is balanced through the six-year period after incorporating into the
projections:
1) March-2019 sales/use tax forecast from CU-Leeds School of Business
2) Minimum/must-have requested capital and expense projects approved in the previous year’s
plan with costs in outlying years, including fleet requirements
3) High priority new project requests within State of Good Repair parameters, including fleet
requirements
4) Reductions, eliminations or deferrals of non-critical requested projects
5) SOGR allowance in 2025
6) Use of previously-issued debt and internal funds to support planned fleet purchases
7) New COP (Certificates of Participation) financing issued in 2022 to support planned fleet
purchases
7) Contribution to reserve funds in all years of the plan
8) No service reductions other than reprogrammed fixed route service through this period

Packet Pg. 124

12.H

Exhibit I summarizes the Base System 2020-2025 projected cash flow activity based on the staff
recommendation incorporating the following:
 Revenue estimates:
 Fare revenue of $124.4 million in 2020 is based on the recommended fare change
proposal presented by staff in September 2018 and adopted by the Board. The Mid-term
Financial Plan assumes additional revenue from increasing fares in 2022 and 2025. This
revenue could come from other revenue sources that will be explored before the Board
considers a fare increase or from cost savings that would reduce the need for a fare
increase. (Line 1)
 Sales and use tax incorporates the March-2019 semi-annual update from the CU-Leeds
School of Business for the years 2019-2025. In all years of the Mid-term Financial plan,
the medium baseline forecast from CU is used. Of the total forecasted amounts, 0.6% is
apportioned to the Base System. (Line 2)
o The CU-Leeds forecast contains confidence bounds on total RTD revenues. The
mean forecast through 2020 is bracketed by 67% confidence bounds of $646.0
million on the low side and $732.3 million for the upper bound (at 1% sales/use tax
rate). The upper bound estimate is 6.1% higher than the medium baseline forecast,
meaning that it is not impossible or unrealistic that revenue could grow somewhat
strongly over the next year. Likewise, economic threats pose downside risk to the
forecast, with a 6.4% lower bound. The values of the high and low forecast
bounds are computed as 67% confidence bounds, meaning that a 0.67 probability
exists that the interval between low and high forecast values will contain the actual
value of the variable being predicted.
 Grant revenue projected receipts are based upon past trends, formula allocations, and
known proceeds. Amounts are escalated at the area Consumer Price Index (CPI) (obtained
from Moody’s) or as identified. (Line 3)
 Other income consists of on-going advertising revenue, joint venture revenue, and IGA and
miscellaneous rental income, escalated at the CPI beginning in 2020. (Line 4)
 Operating expenses (excluding depreciation):
 Operating expenses are increased at area CPI rates and then adjusted for known items and
necessary increases/reductions. The area CPI rates follow: (Line 7)
2020:
2.6%
2021:
2.6%
2022:
2.6%
2023:
2.6%
2024:
2.6%
2025:
2.6%
 Operating expenses include the Collective Bargaining Agreement at a negotiated amount
through 2020 and then escalated at the CPI rate for 2021-2025.
 Operating expenses also include higher costs for purchased transportation contracts in all
years of the plan as various contracts are re-bid. The additional costs excluding start-up
costs are programmed at $7.2 million beginning in 2020 and then escalated. (Lines 8, 12)
 Service increase consists of the cost of new service projects to be operated by RTD in
2020-2022 to include the Golden FlexRide service. RTD costs will be reimbursed in full
with contributed funds from the applicable municipalities.
RTD will make the
determination in future years whether to continue such service. (Line 9)
 Costs of operating the West Line, R Line, DUS Bus Concourse, Free MetroRide, BRT, HLine extension, and SERE are fully allocated from Base to FasTracks based on resource
drivers for all years of the plan. In addition, a portion of overhead costs is also allocated

Packet Pg. 125

12.H








for the Commuter Rail Lines. Thus, Base total expenses are reduced by the amount of the
allocation. (Line 10)
 Diesel fuel is forecast at the 2019 lock price of $2.30/gallon and escalated at the national
CPI rates as follows: (Line 11)
2020:
2.2%
2021:
2.2%
2022:
2.3%
2023:
2.2%
2024:
2.3%
2025:
2.2%
 Gasoline is forecast at $2.90/gallon in 2020, which is same cost per gallon used in the
2019 budget, and then escalated at the national CPI rates above. (Line 11)
 The line item for expense projects (O&M) includes specifically identified minimum/musthave operating and maintenance projects approved in the previous year’s plan with costs
in outlying years, plus high priority new project requests based on SOGR priorities. These
projects are detailed in Exhibit III. Other projects may be added based on available cash
flow if sales tax revenue improves or there are excess fund balances at year-end. Specific
projects will be determined from the deferred project list in Exhibit IV. (Line 12)
o It should be noted that included in the operating projects line item is an allocation to
FasTracks for certain projects that serve both the Base System and FasTracks. Also, a
SOGR allowance of $3.5 million is included in the year 2025. (Lines 12, 13)
 The FasTracks bus service, or “rubber tire” service based on the 2004 FasTracks Financial
Plan whereby FasTracks will fund enhanced bus service on the Base System, increases by
the CPI rate serially each year. (Line 14)
Investment income is based on current yields adjusted for expected changes in investable
balances and forecasted interest rates per forward rate curves. (Line 17)
Interest expense is calculated by individual debt instruments outstanding during each year by
1) using debt amortization schedules for current debt and 2) forecasting new interest expense
on anticipated new debt issued based on forward interest rate curves. (Line 18)
The line items for capital expenditures includes specifically identified minimum/must-have
capital projects approved in the previous year’s plan with costs in outlying years, plus the
minimum required new fleet, and high priority new project requests based on SOGR priorities,
detailed in Exhibit II. Dollar amounts of the new fleet are determined so as not to exceed cash
flow constraints determined in the plan model. Other projects may be added based on
available cash flow if sales tax revenue improves or there are excess fund balances at yearend. Specific projects will be determined from the deferred project list in Exhibit IV. (Lines
21, 22, 23)
Regarding the Board-appropriated fund, capital replacement fund, and unrestricted operating
reserve:
 Staff recommends that the Board-appropriated fund be funded at a minimum of $3
million in 2020-2025. This fund is projected to reach a balance of $41.4 million in
2025. (Lines 24, 38)
 Staff recommends that the capital replacement fund not be funded until 2024 and then
at $3 million each year through 2025. This fund is projected to reach a balance of
$6.0 million in 2025. The capital replacement fund was drawn to zero in 2018 to
support capital expenditures (fleet acquisition). (Lines 25, 39)
 The Fiscal Policy Statement in Fund Balance Policy 4 allows for the designation of an
unrestricted operating fund used to respond to unanticipated events, including revenue
shortfalls. The unrestricted operating reserve was established in 2017 and funded
with available cash flow. In all years of the Base System plan, the unrestricted

Packet Pg. 126

12.H










operating fund will be funded with available cash flow, but staff recommends that the
unrestricted operating fund be drawn minimally in 2020-2022 to help balance the plan,
and then funded at $3 million annually. This fund is projected to reach a balance of
$28.7 million in 2025. (Lines 26, 40)
 The total of these three funds is projected to be $76.1 million in 2025.
A transfer to FasTracks for Base System support of FasTracks operations is not anticipated to
be necessary over the course of this six-year plan. (Line 27)
Financing proceeds represent COPs issued for bus and light rail vehicle acquisition in
accordance with fleet schedules, net of grant funding and use of capital acquisition fund.
New debt issuance of $30 million will become necessary in the plan in 2022. (Line 29)
Principal payments on debt are derived from individual debt instruments outstanding during
each year for current and future debt using debt amortization schedules. Principal payments
are forecast on both existing and new debt balances. (Line 30)
Other line items consist of the roll-over of the unrestricted fund ending balance at each yearend, estimated changes to restricted reserves, available project funds, and the use of
previously-issued COP-bond proceeds for future year capital expenditures. (Lines 33, 34, 35,
36)
The plan is balanced during the six-year period as shown by the positive unrestricted year-end
fund balance. The objective is to maintain a minimum unrestricted year-end fund balance of
$2 million each year through 2025 while supporting a minimum critical level of capital and
expense projects and building reserve fund balances. (Line 37)

*net of FasTracks allocation

As required by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), RTD must review its MTFP for any Title VI
impacts (disproportionate impacts on minority and low income communities). Any service changes
specified in the plan will be reviewed for Title VI impacts during the service planning process prior to
final recommendations on service changes. For the capital component of the plan, Title VI impacts are
reviewed on improvements that are over and above the state-of-good-repair elements (repairs,
replacements and rehabilitations) of the capital program. A comprehensive Title VI review will be
undertaken and a certification of review will be issued by the Title VI manager.
FasTracks
The underlying assumptions for FasTracks in the 2020-2025 MTFP are consistent with those used in
the Base System:
 Fare revenues are projected based on the fare structure changes approved by the Board in
September 2018, adding revenue for new lines at their projected opening dates.
 Sales and use tax projections for the 0.4% sales and use tax incorporate the March 2019
Leeds forecasts.
 Grant revenues are based on existing grant agreements and past trends, adjusted at CPI as
appropriate.
 Additional fixed guideway grants are assumed beginning nine years after corridors enter
revenue service.
 Interest income on available balance is projected using the same methodology as for the Base
System.
 The cost allocations to FasTracks from the Base System and the FasTracks plan bus service
increase feed directly from the Base System plan.
 Operating and maintenance costs for the Eagle Project are derived from the Concession
Agreement.
 Operating and maintenance costs for the North Metro project include startup costs to prepare
for revenue service under RTD operation.
 Annual allowance for major rehabilitation of corridors outside the Eagle Project are assumed at
0.3% of installed asset value, starting seven years after the corridors enter revenue service.
The total FasTracks project budget through 2020 included in the FasTracks plan is approximately $5.6
billion. There are two changes from the 2019-2024 MTFP:
 Additional funding for the North Metro settlement, approved by the Board in October 2018 $15.0 million

Packet Pg. 128

12.H

 Increase in estimated third party in-kind contributions for the Eagle Project, offset by an increase
in estimated revenues - $15.0 million
Project-by-project costs are included as Exhibit VII.
Future implementation of projects not included in the current plan would require identification of
funding sources for construction and operations, and would require approval of the Board. Therefore,
the FasTracks plan is a dynamic tool, which is updated annually as projects move towards completion
and any changes approved by the Board are incorporated.
The projected FasTracks cash flow through 2025 does not require Base System funding to support
FasTracks corridor operations and maintenance. However, funding from the FasTracks Internal
Savings Account (FISA) will be needed in 2024 and 2025 to fund FasTracks corridor operations and
maintenance. The cash flow by year through 2025 is presented as Exhibit VIII.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The staff-recommended Mid-term Financial Plan provides RTD with a plan for maintaining a positive
unrestricted year-end fund balance in each year of the plan while growing reserve fund balances.
However, uncontrollable economic factors, such as sales tax revenue, cost of fuel, materials, and
supplies, as well as economic conditions will continue to have an impact on the plan, and may
challenge staff to present new options and solutions during the 2020 budget period.

ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors adopts the 2020-2025 Mid-term Financial Plan.
2. Defer the adoption of a 2020-2025 Mid-term Financial Plan to a later date. This is not
recommended because the Mid-term Financial Plan identifies the capital programs, expenditures,

Packet Pg. 129

12.H

and service guidelines for the 2020 budget process and adoption of the plan serves as a
confirmation of the Board of Directors' vision for the 2020 Budget.
3. Provide staff additional direction in the selection of assumptions for the projected 2020-2025
Mid-term Financial Plan. This is not the desired action and will result in delay of the Mid-term
Financial Plan adoption and possible delay in the 2020 budget process.

Crossing development in Wheatridge. This station will replace the current Applewood
Transfer Station that is located on property having a 3-year lease (6-month
termination clause) with WalMart at 38th Avenue and Youngfield Street. This new
transfer station will include RTD standard improvements including but not limited to:
lighting, landscaping, shelters, benches, trash receptacles, typical safety/security
components, double unit driver’s relief station, bike amenities and other
improvements based on site specific needs that will be identified as part of the Site
Plan approval process with the local agencies.

Project is purchase of various trucks, vans, and pick-ups through 2025.
Project request is to various administrative and pool replacement vehicles through
2025. All of these vehicles will be at the end of their useful life at the time they are
replaced. These vehicles include transit police vehicles.
Project is to purchase various in-plant vehicles and equipment through 2025. The type
of equipment being replaced includes but is not limited to electric carts, street
sweepers, snow blowers, forklifts, tractors, mowers, etc.
Our current frame pulling machine is now obsolete. The company we purchased it
from is no longer in business and we can no longer find safe replacement parts. The
machine is also very dangerous to use, and no longer is meeting our needs to
straighten the frames on buses. The replacement machine is a safer and more
accurate means of straightening vehicle frames. This machine is needed to help us fix
accident vehicles and get them back on the street in as timely a fashion as possible.
This is a critical piece of equipment for body shop repairs that must be replaced.

Enterprise Customer Relationship
Management System (CRM)

Location
Civic Center Plaza (CCP)

Project Description
TrapezeCOM has been the only customer complaint and commendation tracking tool
in use for the past 8 years at RTD and most departments find it difficult to use and
limited in its functionality. Various departments/projects like Communications,
FasTracks, and the SmartCard system use their own customer issue
tracking/management tools to collect customer data and feedback that is not
integrated. Reporting from TrapezeCOM is also not conducive to the needs of the
District. Customer Care and other departments, including Legal, are unable to pull
reports to view a customer's overall interaction/relationship with RTD. In addition, the
current system has no analytics capabilities, so we are unable to pull reports to
understand complaints about specific routes, lines, stops, etc. The recommendation
from some of the studies like the SmartCard Business Process Re-engineering (SMT
BPR) and Fare Systems visioning exercise was that RTD procure and implement an
Enterprise Level CRM system that would meet the needs of all departments and
projects. The first phase (2018) of this project is to implement a contact center
customer relationship management tool for servicing customer needs and to replace
the TrapezeCOM functionality as a customer service case management need. The
future phases (2019 and beyond) will be to integrate and implement the service
module to other needs of the Distrct.

Real-Time Passenger Information (RTPI) provides RTD passengers with predictive

predictive arrival times for buses via three primary delivery systems: 1) General
Transit Feed Specification for Real Time or GTFS-RT (which feeds the information to
Google Maps and some third party application developers), 2) Passenger Information
Display (PID) signs, and 3) the RTD website. Additional funding will be required to
implement future phases of this project. This will include planning, design, and
development of a third party developer portal that will allow the open developer
community to access rich data based on APIs (application programming interface, as
opposed to the flat file/GTFS-RT protocol), and build interesting and contextually rich
applications for our ridership and trip planning components. Also integration with IVR
and RiderAlert data will require additional funding.

Information Security TechnologySupervisory Controls Environment

Location
Project Description
Mariposa Light Rail Division Recent cyber security audits from DHS and Parsons identified several deficiencies in
the Supervisory Controls Environment (SCE) security environment. Currently, there is
no Security Information and Event Monitoring (SIEM) within the SNE or authentication
of switch access control to the SCE domain. Additionally, a two-layer Remote Access
architecture is required since the SCE gateway is directly to the Internet. The
Supervisory Controls Department is requesting funding to purchase software and
hardware technology to support SIEM, RADIUS, and Remote Access functions within
the SCE. The target technologies are the QRadar SIEM, HP RADIUS server, and
Bomgar RAS server. These technologies will address 100% of the information security
issues identified in the cyber security audits.

Risk Management Information
System Upgrade

Blake Street Office

Risk Management is looking for ways to improve our service level to both internal and
external customers. By upgrading our risk management information software, we will
avoid making data entry mistakes, automate processes and create efficiencies that
would allow the claims representative the opportunity to be more proactive. The
added functionality of a new system would result in improved communication and
assistance for injured employees as well as providing critical claim histories on bodily
injury and property claims which can be a red flag for potentially fraudulent claims.
SSAM and the Executive Safety and Security Committee is dedicated to improving the
safety of employees and the general public. Enabling an automated and hands free
compilation of claims data in our enterprise data warehouse or other software
employed by SSAM would provide SSAM and the Committee with facts and trends on
which to focus safety measures to reduce injuries.

Standard Security Architecture for
Supervisory Controls (SC SSA)

Mariposa Light Rail Division The existing Supervisory Controls Network (SCN) has limited cyber security features
both in the Mariposa Computer Center and Communication Houses. The SCN enables
the Light Rail OCC to operate and manage the Light Rail Vehicle (LRV) fleet from within
the Mariposa OCC. The Supervisory Controls (SC) department has adopted a Standard
Security Architecture used in Industrial Controls environments to security critical
controls from unauthorized access and comply with recent cyber security audits from
the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Parsons Security. The SC SSA
establishes a high level of network compartmentalization and integrates multi-layer
security technology within the SCN to minimize propagation of Malware and
unauthorized access. Specifically, the SC SSA compartmentalizes the core computing
environment (Mariposa Computer Room) and the extended networks (Comm Houses)
to establish firewalled gateways within and between corridors to reduce networkwide Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS). The SC SSA also
allows for secured communication with the RTD IT environment to share Light Rail
Vehicle (LRV) and alignment data between systems. The SC SSA will address
approximately 70% of the cyber security issues identified in the recent audits.

Project Description

Cab Signaling on LRVs

Districtwide

The proposed Cab Signaling project would enable RTD Light Rail Vehicles (LRVs) to
constantly display, on the dash of the cab, the maximum speed a train is permitted to
operate based on signal indications and track conditions ahead of the train. The
wayside signal logic transmits a 100 hertz pulsed signal into the rail using 7 unique
pulsed rates, each having a different speed limit associated with it. If an Operator fails
to comply to a reduced speed limit zone and begins braking within a predetermined
grace period, the LRV will automatically apply brakes and come to a complete stop.
The project costs are estimated to provide for new software and hardware for all of
our current LRV fleet and the additional LRVs on order. Additionally the project funds
would provide for new signal software for each of our existing corridors that currently
have Automatic Train Stop (ATS) functionality.

Project Description
RTD currently owns a vacant 10,000 square foot facility which is located at the
University Station under the existing parking structure. This request is to relocate the
existing Security Command Center Operations to this location. We feel this space is
ideal for our needs for many reasons, including its size, which is more than 4 times
what is currently being used. This space will also provide for the Map 21
recommendation of an (EOC) Emergency Operations Center for the District. The
facility will be designed primarily as a Security Command Center, but also function as
an EOC (Emergency Operating Center). This design would greatly benefit the District's
operating divisions by creating a facility that could support and operate Light Rail
Control, Bus Dispatch and the IT Division during critical incidents. It would serve as a
redundant common operating facility in emergencies for all disciplines while under an
EOC activation. The design will allow for redundant face to face operations, should a
large scale emergency occur. The facility would also provide a large server room,
designed to support both security operations and corporate IT redundancies. The
existing Security Command Center would be re-purposed into the Transit Police
Division as a “Field Operations” building to consolidate services between the Transit
Police Division, Allied Universal Security and the Denver Police Department contracted
police. The current view room would be converted into a large conference and
training room. The current server room would be surrendered to the IT Division for
continued use to support security and RTD corporate networks.

The existing Ticket Vending Machine (TVM) is model ST80 and does not meet current
credit card security standards which is one of RTD s greatest security vulnerabilities.
The TVM should have P2PE, EMV and meet PCI-DSS. P2PE is a point-to-point
encryption solution which is a combination of secure devices, applications and
processes that encrypt data from the point of transaction to the bank. EMV stands for
Europay, MasterCard, and Visa. These three companies developed the chip reader
technology for secure transactions. Companies that don t use EMV will take
responsibility for fraudulent transactions. EMV (chip and pin) is a service that is visible
to our customers and they have come to know, expect, and associate with modern
security. PCI-DSS stands for Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, which sets
the requirements for organizations and sellers to safely and securely accept, store,
process, and transmit cardholder data during credit card transaction to prevent fraud
and data breaches. Scheidt & Bachmann (S&B) has proposed an upgrade to the ST80
TVM because they are out of PCI-DSS compliance so the operating system needs to be
upgraded to Windows 10 in order to work with the FareGo back-end. This is a request
for $2,800,000 to be spent by 2022 on an open procurement to replace all ST80 TVMs
and the backend system. With this plan all of the old TVMs will have P2PE, EMV and
meet PCI-DSS by the fall of 2022.

Project Description

Platte Division

Project is to replace thirteen (13) exhaust fans at the maintenance end at the Platte
facility. These exhaust fans have been in service removing bus tail pipe emissions from
the maintenance areas for more than twenty years and are beyond their useful life.
Maintenance is becoming increasingly more difficult due to the age of this equipment.
Current energy code requirements may require upgrading existing 100% outside air
units to energy recovery units. The energy code requirements will make it necessary
to evaluate and remodel HVEC units and exhaust fans in the Maintenance End at the
same time.

Project Description

FlexPass Program

Blake Street Office

RTD offers to its riders a versatile online payment system called FlexPass. The FlexPass
program helps move people by providing a fiscally sustainable program for RTD as
well as to employees of participating employers, and it helps contribute to overall
customer satisfaction. The program’s flexible nature enables employees to choose
their service level, vary passes from month-to-month, and enter or leave the program
at any time. Plus, it offers incentives for employers and employees to participate
including a pre-tax option. The program accounts for approximately $4.5 million in
annual revenue and it continues to experience growth each year. In March 2010, RTD
contracted with 360Media in Englewood, CO to provide and administer an
eCommerce website to provide services to FlexPass business customers and their
employees. The term of the agreement was for two (2) contract years and three (3)
one (1) year options. In 2014, RTD exercised the final option to retain the services of
360Media. It was envisioned that this eCommerce website will be replaced by RTD’s
SmartMedia system and that this function will be brought in-house in the near future.
Unfortunately, this solution is not currently budgeted for in the immediate Smart Card
plans for implementation. It will most likely be discussed in 2020. Historically this
program was funded through a Smart Card line item which is no longer available.

After further analysis, it has been determined that the project will require $225,000 in
Operating and Maintenance Costs rather than the approved $75,000 in on-going
Operating and Maintenance. The additional funds are necessary because the cost of
the product is higher than we originally scoped. In addition, it has come to light that
there is a need for a new email service and text messaging provider in order to send
out the customized, targeted messages to riders. We are resubmitting this request to
ask for additional Operating and Maintenance funds to maintain and build upon the
product going forward. Communications is looking to implement a Rider Alert System
in order to communicate up-to-the-minute service alerts for our riders in timely
manner. The system will include a web-based interface that allows staff to create and
manage the thousands of service alerts that are sent out each year. The Alerts System
will be intuitive and fast to use, allowing simple alerts to be created in seconds. At the
same time, the system will offer fine grained control over selecting the specific route,
branch, trip, or stop an alert applies to, when an alert is in effect, and by what
channels (like emails, text messages, electronic signs, agency website, General Transit
Feed Specification real-time feeds and third party apps) the alerts should be
disseminated. The system will use templates to automatically generate appropriate
messages for all the dissemination channels.

TrapezeCOM has been the only customer complaint and commendation tracking tool
in use for the past 8 years at RTD and most departments find it difficult to use and
limited in its functionality. Various departments/projects like Communications,
FasTracks, and the SmartCard system use their own customer issue
tracking/management tools to collect customer data and feedback that is not
integrated. Reporting from TrapezeCOM is also not conducive to the needs of the
District. Customer Care and other departments, including Legal, are unable to pull
reports to view a customer's overall interaction/relationship with RTD. In addition, the
current system has no analytics capabilities, so we are unable to pull reports to
understand complaints about specific routes, lines, stops, etc. The recommendation
from some of the studies like the SmartCard Business Process Re-engineering (SMT
BPR) and Fare Systems visioning exercise was that RTD procure and implement an
Enterprise Level CRM system that would meet the needs of all departments and
projects. The first phase (2018) of this project is to implement a contact center
customer relationship management tool for servicing customer needs and to replace
the TrapezeCOM functionality as a customer service case management need. The
future phases (2019 and beyond) will be to integrate and implement the service
module to other needs of the district.

This project will implement a District-wide comprehensive Enterprise Content
Management (ECM) solution to consolidate identified existing systems that create,
capture or store content at RTD to create a single point of access. The project scope
will include the development of policies, procedures, taxonomy and metadata for the
consistent identification, use, maintenance, retrieval, retention, and destruction of
data. The project also will include identification of personnel and tools required to
implement the policies and procedures, implementation of the system, and the
development of training and audit tools to support the ongoing utilization of the
system. The current project cost estimate beyond the approved scope for IQBG
assumes that RTD will own and maintain the hardware and software in-house. As part
of its scope, IQBG will recommend a path forward for procurement of ECM tools,
which could include externally hosted systems or software-as-a-service (SaaS) systems
instead of in-house tools. If a hosted or SaaS system is selected, the cost structure of
the project and future staffing levels will change.

compliance.
Project is to purchase and continually fund a suite of equipment, software and
cybersecurity specialist consulting services designed to identify security and
compliance gaps in our IT systems, remediate those gaps, and monitor for and
respond to suspicious activity in a timely manner. Assessment and mitigation requires
specialized skill sets and separation of duties (from RTD systems specialists) which are
more cost-effective and operationally effective to outsource at this time; additional
equipment and services are needed to achieve compliance and security goals such as
network separation, threat monitoring, and asset discovery.

Real-Time Passenger Information (RTPI) provides RTD passengers with predictive
arrival times for their next bus. IT and Marketing are working toward providing
predictive arrival times for buses via three primary delivery systems: 1) General
Transit Feed Specification for Real Time or GTFS-RT (which feeds the information to
Google Maps and some third party application developers), 2) Passenger Information
Display (PID) signs, and 3) the RTD website. Additional funding will be required to
implement future phases of this project. This will include planning, design, and
development of a third party developer portal that will allow the open developer
community to access rich data based on APIs (application programming interface, as
opposed to the flat file/GTFS-RT protocol), and build interesting and contextually rich
applications for our ridership and trip planning components. Also integration with IVR
and RiderAlert data will require additional funding.

accounts to account-based smart card accounts. Expected to be completed by January
2022 or before. Total project budget is estimated at $3.6M. RTD anticipates receiving

This is incremental funding required for the existing Clever Devices contract #16DO18 contract hosting and warranty for the service planning and scheduling software
system.
Risk Management is looking for ways to improve our service level to both internal and
external customers. By upgrading our risk management information software, we will
avoid making data entry mistakes, automate processes and create efficiencies that
would allow the claims representative the opportunity to be more proactive. The
added functionality of a new system would result in improved communication and
assistance for injured employees as well as providing critical claim histories on bodily
injury and property claims which can be a red flag for potentially fraudulent claims.
SSAM and the Executive Safety and Security Committee is dedicated to improving the
safety of employees and the general public. Enabling an automated and hands free
compilation of claims data in our enterprise data warehouse or other software
employed by SSAM would provide SSAM and the Committee with facts and trends on
which to focus safety measures to reduce injuries.
Required by FTA 673, the Safety Management System is a tool to efficiently gather
and analyze safety data, which includes OJI (On The Job Injuries), and FTA and NDT
reportable events. Causal factors are required to be determined for each event.
Currently we use paper-based and incomplete data collection, which is cumbersome
and inefficient.
Request is for 1 FTE Cybersecurity Engineer. This position is an in-house resource for

RTD’s Rider Alert system was replaced in late 2018/early 2019 with a much more
intuitive and robust system that allows for much more detailed and refined alerts to
subscribers, including down to a route/block/stop level. With this new system, RTD
will be able to communicate information related to dropped trips, detours by
impacted stops, disruptions by rail station, etc. Customer Care’s Digital Customer
Relations Liaison team will assume responsibility for increased outbound
communication to passengers, and will also assume responsibility from Bus Ops
Dispatch on certain detours and planned disruptions. With the addition of two FTE,
the team will now be at six and will need a Lead Position rather than reporting directly

In 2019, RTD is offering tickets to the employee event for the employee + 3 for a total
of 4 tickets plus lunch. Increases after 2020 are attributed to assuming the cost of the
venue will go up or having to change venues which will be more expensive.

RTD was awarded grant funding from DRCOG to develop a regional wayfinding design
guide with a strong emphasis on multimodal connections and to develop a universally
legible wayfinding system connection to transit. This will improve first and last mile
connections to RTD services by standardizing wayfinding in the District and making it
easier to implement wayfinding systems in the future. RTD has committed $25,000 in
local match and Aurora and Denver has also committed a total of $25,000 in local
match. The total project budget is $250,000 and RTD s local match of $25,000 (10% of
the total project budget) will leverage $200,000 in DRCOG grant funding.

RTD has a GIS consultant to provide the following services: mapping services that
cannot be performed in-house, monitoring of the District's boundary for any new
annexations, and providing RTD with the most up-to-date list of precincts by county.
RTD has required this service since the creation of RTD in 1969 to keep accurate
records of District boundaries.
This project is an equity training initiative intended to mitigate the risk of both Title VI
and EEO discrimination lawsuits and complaints. The training will aim to provide RTD
employees and applicable contractors with cultural competency, implicit bias
management, de-escalation tactics and a basic understanding of civil rights
requirements. To save cost, a consultant will develop a training program
incorporating a train the trainer or train the facilitator approach. The Transit Equity
and Civil Rights offices will then collaborate to extend and maintain the training
program without consultant support. Customer facing (security officers, operators,
sales outlets, etc ), senior, and executive level employees are the priority for this
training initiative.

Security Command Center University Project +

Location
Districtwide

Project Description
RTD currently owns a vacant 10,000 square foot facility which is located at the
University Station under the existing parking structure. This request is to relocate the
existing Security Command Center Operations to this location. We feel this space is
ideal for our needs for many reasons, including its size, which is more than 4 times
what is currently being used. This space will also provide for the Map 21
recommendation of an (EOC) Emergency Operations Center for the District. The
facility will be designed primarily as a Security Command Center, but also function as
an EOC (Emergency Operating Center). This design would greatly benefit the District's
operating divisions by creating a facility that could support and operate Light Rail
Control, Bus Dispatch and the IT Division during critical incidents. It would serve as a
redundant common operating facility in emergencies for all disciplines while under an
EOC activation. The design will allow for redundant face to face operations, should a
large scale emergency occur. The facility would also provide a large server room,
designed to support both security operations and corporate IT redundancies. The
existing Security Command Center would be re-purposed into the Transit Police
Division as a “Field Operations” building to consolidate services between the Transit
Police Division, Allied Universal Security and the Denver Police Department contracted
police. The current view room would be converted into a large conference and
training room. The current server room would be surrendered to the IT Division for
continued use to support security and RTD corporate networks.

RTD currently provides armed uniform security officers along our light rail corridors,
facilities, and system wide. CR has a security officer on every train. These officers
provide security response, patrol, and conduct fare inspection for our rail system,
vehicles, and facilities. RTD Security officers are instrumental in the operation of our
department as well as provide services to keep our employees, patrons, and public
safe while on RTD. This request will provide for a staged increased such that every LRV
will have security presence.

From:

Heather McKillop,

Date:

Subject:

Approval of the 2020 Fiscal Policy

CFO/AGM,

Date: October 16, 2019
&

GM
Board Meeting Date:

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approves and adopts the revised Fiscal Policy Statement for 2020.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management
Task Goal #1 – Fiscal Sustainability
BACKGROUND
Proposed modifications to the Fiscal Policy Statement (the “Policy”) are brought to the Board of
Directors for approval during the year, as necessary. In addition, each year staff presents the proposed
Policy for development of the upcoming year’s budget.
The most recent modification to the Policy was approved by the Board of Directors in October 2018 for
the 2019 fiscal year. Those changes were related to 1) re-write of the Investment Policies section to
state that RTD financial assets are managed in accordance with the RTD Investment Policy Statement
approved annually by the RTD Board, 2) wording clarification, consisting of substitution of the words
“Mid-Term Financial Plan” where necessary, and 3) Debt Policies #5 were updated with the most recent
rating agency credit ratings in effect at that date.
DISCUSSION
For 2020, the following changes are proposed:
1) Re-write of the Revenue Policies section as follows:
a. Delete from Revenue Policy #1 the statements that “Staff will plan fare adjustments every
three years in the mid and long-term budgets to adjust for inflation” and ensuring that a
fare structure “achieves revenue levels established in the Mid-Term Financial Plan.”
b. Delete from Revenue Policy #1 the bullet point “is equitable” and replace with “addresses
equity including social and geographical.”
c. Add as Revenue Policy #2 “Fare or other revenue streams and cost savings should aim to
achieve financial levels equivalent to inflationary adjustments in fare revenue established in
the Mid-Term Financial Plan.” Re-number remaining Revenue Policies.
2) Add to Expenditure Policy #3 “See Asset Management Policy RTD-AMD-PLY-0001.”

Packet Pg. 161

12.I

3) Wording clarification consisting of substitution of the words “Mid-Term Financial Plan” for Strategic
Budget Plan (SBP) and Annual Program Evaluation (APE) where necessary. Addition of the words
“Long Range” to references to the 30-year Financial Plan.
4) Update of Debt Policies #5 with the most recent rating agency credit ratings in effect.
Please see the attachments for the full proposed document and document with changes indicated.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Adopting the Fiscal Policy Statement changes as requested may have a financial impact on the 2020
Recommended Budget, the details of which are to be determined.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors approves and adopts the revised Fiscal Policy Statement for 2020.
2. Board of Directors further modifies the recommended changes.
3. Do not adopt the RTD 2020 Fiscal Policy Statement. This is not recommended because RTD’s
Fiscal Policy Statement would not contain all current language, would not adhere to best
practices, and would not best facilitate the needs of RTD’s financial operations.

1. On an annual basis, RTD will prepare and update a six-year Mid-Term Financial Plan
including projected capital construction and improvements, service levels, operating
costs, and revenues to fund the capital and operating programs. Capital projects to
be included in the Mid-Term Financial Plan will be evaluated using the following
criteria:
 total project cost (design and construction) and schedule for completion;
 source of funding;
 operating and maintenance costs for the remainder of the Mid-Term Financial
PlanSBP period;
 benefits and contributions to RTD and the community, including but not limited
to the effect on future operating and maintenance costs, economy, service, and
ridership;
 consideration of alternatives (joint development, etc.); consequences of not
funding; and
 RTD mission statement elements, Board strategic goals, and other relevant
criteria.
2. Priority will be given to replacement of existing assets before consideration of new
assets except as allowed for in the FasTracks Mid-Term Financial PlanAPE and/or
Long Range Ffinancial Pplan (see #7 below).
3. RTD will use the first year capital program from the adopted Mid-Term Financial Plan
as the basis for the capital program to be included in the annual budget.
4. After completion of design of a capital project, cost estimates will be revised. If the
cost estimates exceed Delegation of Authority limits, the project will be brought to
the Board for reconsideration.
5. Facilities will be designed using current technology and allow for future technological
changes in order to be efficient and cost-effective and to protect the public welfare.
6. RTD shall allow for multi-year capital projects to be carried forward in accordance
with the carry-forward resolution adopted by the Board.

Attachment: 2020 Fiscal Policy Statement mark-up (3973 : Approval of the 2020 Fiscal Policy)

programs.

Packet Pg. 165

12.I.a

Fiscal Policy Statement - effective October 1629, 20189

1. RTD will strive to maintain a fund balance in the Base System and FasTracks to
provide for unanticipated expenditures of a nonrecurring nature, to meet unexpected
increases in costs or to mitigate service disruptions as a result of economic
downturns affecting revenue. The Base System should strive to maintain a total
fund balance at an amount approximately equal to three months of Base System
operating expenses excluding depreciation among the following three reserve funds:
the Board-appropriated fund, the unrestricted operating reserve, and the remaining
unrestricted fund balance. For FasTracks, the total of the Board-appropriated fund
and unrestricted fund balance should be maintained at an amount approximately
equal to three months of FasTracks operating expenses excluding depreciation. RTD
will consider and pursue resources that will be directed to fund balance
replenishment. For example, non-recurring revenues and budget surpluses are an
especially appropriate source for replenishing fund balance.
RTD will replenish fund balances as soon as economic conditions allow.
2. In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will designate a Board-appropriated
fund balance on an annual basis. Use of the fund balance will be minimized and
occur only in specific circumstances such as economic downturns. With Board
approval, these funds may be used to avoid cash flow interruptions, reduce the need
for short-term borrowing, and assist in maintaining an investment-grade bond rating.
The source of replenishment of this fund will be identified and replenishment will
take place in a prompt manner.
3. In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will designate a capital replacement
fund on an annual basis. With Board approval, these funds will be used for scheduled
major vehicle replacements and other capital purchases.
The source of
replenishment of this fund will be identified and replenishment will take place in a
prompt manner.
4. In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will designate an unrestricted operating
reserve on an annual basis. Use of the fund balance will be to mitigate service or
project disruptions due to revenue fluctuations, unanticipated expenditures of a
nonrecurring nature, or to avoid cash flow disruptions. The source of replenishment
of this fund will be identified and replenishment will take place in a prompt manner.

Attachment: 2020 Fiscal Policy Statement mark-up (3973 : Approval of the 2020 Fiscal Policy)

FUND BALANCE POLICIES

5. RTD will maintain an emergency (TABOR) reserve equal to three percent of nonFederal revenues, as specified by Article X, Section 20 of the Colorado Constitution.
6. The Board shall establish a reserve for future construction under the FasTracks plan:
4
Packet Pg. 166

12.I.a

Fiscal Policy Statement - effective October 1629, 20189

The FasTracks Management Reserve will be appropriated at a sufficient level each
year to fund adjustments to the FasTracks construction schedule, relating to
logistics or cost savings opportunities that might arise after the annual budget is
adopted, and will not be used to fund the (non-FasTracks) Base System capital
or operating activity.

7. The FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) will be used to provide funding to
complete and operate additional FasTracks projects. Expenditures from the FISA will
be subject to Board approval. Funding of the FISA will be provided from the sources
identified in the Board approved Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM) and other sources
approved by the Board.
8. All other FasTracks funds which have not been appropriated, or otherwise
designated as reserved, in the current budget year will be maintained in a reserve for
future FasTracks capital and operating expenditures and will not be used to fund the
(non-FasTracks) Base System expenditures.

DEBT POLICIES
1. Debt financing will not be issued to support operating expenditures.
2. Capital projects funded through the issuance of bonds, Certificates of Participation
(COPs) or other financial obligations shall be financed for a period not to exceed the
lesser of the expected useful life of the asset or a maximum of 40 years.
3. Effective communication with credit rating agencies will be maintained, and a policy
of full disclosure on every financial report and official statement will be followed.
4. Before long-term debt is issued, the impact of debt service on total annual
expenditures and the net revenue coverage ratio will be analyzed.
5. It is the intent of RTD to maintain a high quality investment-grade credit rating. The
benefit of maintaining RTD's credit ratings at the highest reasonably attainable level
in light of current economic conditions and availability of capital funding is to receive
lower interest rates and lower debt insurance premiums than would be possible with
lower credit ratings. RTD’s current ratings are listed below:

Base System (annual non-FasTracks sales and use tax revenue to annual sales and
use tax debt service for senior non-FasTracks debt) of four times for debt backed by
the 0.6% sales and use tax. RTD will maintain a minimum gross sales tax revenue
bond coverage ratio for FasTracks (annual FasTracks sales and use tax revenue to
annual FasTracks sales and use tax debt service) of two times for debt backed by
the 0.4% FasTracks sales and use tax.
7. RTD will maintain a minimum net revenue coverage ratio (all annual revenues
remaining after operating and maintenance expenses to annual debt service
requirements net of excess appropriations required for variable rate debt) of 1.2
times annual debt service.

BUDGET POLICIES
1. RTD shall comply with all requirements of the Colorado Local Government Budget
Law.
2. As part of the budget development process, the Board will review the current goals,
objectives, and performance indicators for use in preparing the budget for the
following year. The Board will adopt the final performance indicators before the
adoption of the annual budget.
3. The Board will review the adopted fiscal policies annually or on an as-needed basis
to consider any changes that may be necessary.
4. There shall be a budgetary monitoring system that charges expenditures against
approved budget appropriations.

Attachment: 2020 Fiscal Policy Statement mark-up (3973 : Approval of the 2020 Fiscal Policy)

annually as part of the Mid-Term Financial Plan. Each existing and potential revenue
source will be reexamined annually.

expenditure plan that includes projections of annual service growth plus allowances
for operating costs of new capital assets.



total project cost (design and construction) and schedule for completion;
source of funding;
operating and maintenance costs for the remainder of the Mid-Term Financial Plan
period;
benefits and contributions to RTD and the community, including but not limited

cost estimates exceed Delegation of Authority limits, the project will be brought to
the Board for reconsideration.
5. Facilities will be designed using current technology and allow for future technological
changes in order to be efficient and cost-effective and to protect the public welfare.
6. RTD shall allow for multi-year capital projects to be carried forward in accordance

FUND BALANCE POLICIES
1. RTD will strive to maintain a fund balance in the Base System and FasTracks to
provide for unanticipated expenditures of a nonrecurring nature, to meet unexpected
increases in costs or to mitigate service disruptions as a result of economic
downturns affecting revenue. The Base System should strive to maintain a total
fund balance at an amount approximately equal to three months of Base System
operating expenses excluding depreciation among the following three reserve funds:
3
Packet Pg. 174

12.I.b

Fiscal Policy Statement - effective October 29, 2019

RTD will replenish fund balances as soon as economic conditions allow.
2. In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will designate a Board-appropriated
fund balance on an annual basis. Use of the fund balance will be minimized and
occur only in specific circumstances such as economic downturns. With Board
approval, these funds may be used to avoid cash flow interruptions, reduce the need
for short-term borrowing, and assist in maintaining an investment-grade bond rating.
The source of replenishment of this fund will be identified and replenishment will
take place in a prompt manner.
3. In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will designate a capital replacement
fund on an annual basis. With Board approval, these funds will be used for scheduled
major vehicle replacements and other capital purchases.
The source of
replenishment of this fund will be identified and replenishment will take place in a
prompt manner.
4. In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will designate an unrestricted operating
reserve on an annual basis. Use of the fund balance will be to mitigate service or
project disruptions due to revenue fluctuations, unanticipated expenditures of a
nonrecurring nature, or to avoid cash flow disruptions. The source of replenishment
of this fund will be identified and replenishment will take place in a prompt manner.
5. RTD will maintain an emergency (TABOR) reserve equal to three percent of nonFederal revenues, as specified by Article X, Section 20 of the Colorado Constitution.
6. The Board shall establish a reserve for future construction under the FasTracks plan:
 The FasTracks Management Reserve will be appropriated at a sufficient level each
year to fund adjustments to the FasTracks construction schedule, relating to
logistics or cost savings opportunities that might arise after the annual budget is
adopted, and will not be used to fund the (non-FasTracks) Base System capital
or operating activity.

Attachment: 2020 Fiscal Policy Statement (3973 : Approval of the 2020 Fiscal Policy)

the Board-appropriated fund, the unrestricted operating reserve, and the remaining
unrestricted fund balance. For FasTracks, the total of the Board-appropriated fund
and unrestricted fund balance should be maintained at an amount approximately
equal to three months of FasTracks operating expenses excluding depreciation. RTD
will consider and pursue resources that will be directed to fund balance
replenishment. For example, non-recurring revenues and budget surpluses are an
especially appropriate source for replenishing fund balance.

7. The FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) will be used to provide funding to
complete and operate additional FasTracks projects. Expenditures from the FISA will
be subject to Board approval. Funding of the FISA will be provided from the sources

DEBT POLICIES
1. Debt financing will not be issued to support operating expenditures.
2. Capital projects funded through the issuance of bonds, Certificates of Participation
(COPs) or other financial obligations shall be financed for a period not to exceed the
lesser of the expected useful life of the asset or a maximum of 40 years.
3. Effective communication with credit rating agencies will be maintained, and a policy
of full disclosure on every financial report and official statement will be followed.
4. Before long-term debt is issued, the impact of debt service on total annual
expenditures and the net revenue coverage ratio will be analyzed.
5. It is the intent of RTD to maintain a high quality investment-grade credit rating. The
benefit of maintaining RTD's credit ratings at the highest reasonably attainable level
in light of current economic conditions and availability of capital funding is to receive
lower interest rates and lower debt insurance premiums than would be possible with
lower credit ratings. RTD’s current ratings are listed below:

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
adopt a 2020 contribution of $6.1 million to RTD’s Salaried Employees’ Defined Benefit Pension Trust
(the “DB Plan”), which pays a specified monthly benefit at retirement. It is also recommended that the
RTD Board of Directors adopt a 2020 contribution of 9% of each participant’s eligible compensation to
the Salaried Employees’ Defined Contribution Plan (the “DC Plan”), which contributes a specified amount
to the plan for each year of employment.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Task Goal #2 – Address Service & Human Capital
BACKGROUND
In December, 2007, the RTD Board of Directors closed the DB Plan to new employees with new
employees hired on January 1, 2008 and later participating in the DC Plan. From January 1, 2008 to
December 31, 2012 both the DB and DC Plan had been funded on a 9% of salaries basis.
DISCUSSION
DB Plan
In 2012, the Board of Directors agreed that beginning in 2013, annual contributions to the DB Plan
would be made at a fixed annual amount of $3.1 million rather than as a percentage of salaries as a
result of the actuary’s recommendation at that time. The fixed annual contribution of $3.1 million to the
DB Plan was determined by the plan’s actuaries to be the annual contribution necessary to maintain a
“fully funded” status for the plan in the future. In 2016, the policy was changed to fund an amount that
would keep the Plan “actuarially sound” based on the recommendations of the Actuary and RTD’s Chief
Financial Officer.
The Actuary has updated the DB Plan projections to reflect the final 1/1/2019 valuation assumptions for
the DB Plan. The 2020 Actuary recommended contribution is $8.1 million.
If the Actuarial
recommendation of $8.1 million is made beginning in 2020, the plan is expected to achieve 100%
funding in 2031 and the recommended amount is projected to drop below $5.1 million in 2032.
RTD’s Chief Financial Officer is recommending a contribution of $6.1 million. If RTD contributed $6.1
million in 2020 and beyond, the Plan is expected to achieve 100% funding in 2040. This also assumes
an annual rate of return of 7% per year.

Packet Pg. 180

12.J

DC Plan
Section 4.1 of the RTD Salaried Employees’ DC Plan adopted by the RTD Board provides that the
Employer may, at its sole discretion, set a contribution rate between 7 to 9% per year for participants.
The contribution rate has been 9% each year to the DC Plan from 2008 through 2019.
FINANCIAL IMPACT

ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors adopt a 2020 contribution of $6.1 million to RTD’s Salaried Employees’ Defined Benefit
Pension Trust (the “DB Plan”), which pays a specified monthly benefit at retirement. It is also
recommended that the RTD Board of Directors adopt a 2020 contribution of 9% of each
participant’s eligible compensation to the Salaried Employees’ Defined Contribution Plan (the “DC
Plan”), which contributes a specified amount to the plan for each year of employment.
2. The RTD Board of Directors could certify an amount to be contributed to the RTD Salaried
Employees’ Defined Benefit Pension Trust or the RTD Salaried Employees’ Defined Contribution
Plan at amounts other than $6.1 million and 9%, respectively.
3. Do not authorize a contribution to the RTD Salaried Employees’ Pension Plans. This is not
recommended because the DB Plan’s funding status would deteriorate and the liability would
increase.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approves the 2020 Plan Year Salaried Benefits plan and authorizes the General Manager/CEO or his
designee to enter into agreements with the insurance carriers.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Task Goal #2 – Address Service & Human Capital
BACKGROUND
Annually the staff brings the proposed Salaried Employee Benefits plan for approval to the Board of
Directors. Approval of the plan by the Board establishes the rates for Open Enrollment and provides
costs for the 2020 Budget. The Open Enrollment period for salaried staff begins November 3 through
November 17, 2019.
DISCUSSION
The goals for the 2020 plan year are: 1) Achieve the 2020 budget goals, 2) Continued focus on
containing cost and emphasis on improving health and wellness consumerism, 3) Maintain market
competitiveness, and 4) Insure compliance with PPACA – Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
(Health Care Reform provisions as applicable to RTD). Following is a summary of the changes for the
2020 plan year.
Based on input from the Board in 2016, the Benefits Committee reviewed the medical premiums and
RTD/ employee share of the premium payment. The Benefits Committee is moving toward the less
expensive plans, Kaiser, as being the base plans to which employees would buy up for Cigna. In year
three, 2020, premiums for participants on the CIGNA HDHP and PPO plans, will be calculated as
follows:


Cigna participants will pay 70% of the difference in premium between the Cigna plan and a like
Kaiser plan. This is an increase of 15% over the employee premium calculation for 2019.

Medical
 Kaiser HDHP
o No plan changes – 2.46% increase in premium
 Kaiser DHMO
o No plan changes – 2.38% increase in premium
 Cigna HDHP
o No plan changes – 14.61% increase in premium
 Cigna PPO
o No plan changes – 14.67 % increase in premium

Packet Pg. 182

12.K

Dental
 Increase to the annual maximum on the Preferred Provider Plus (PPO) plan to $2,500. The annual
premium increased by 3.3%.
 No change to the Exclusive Panel Option (EPO) Dental Plan and no change in rate.
Life & Disability
 Unum is under a rate guarantee – no changes in premium or plan design
Vision/Business Travel Accident
 Superior Vision is under a rate guarantee – no changes in rate or plan design


Business Travel Insurance is budgeted/paid on a three year basis, 2020 is year two of the most
recent contract. The 2019-2021 rate is $1900.00 total for three years, this premium is actually
approximately $100.00 less than the premium for 2016-2018.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The 2020 planned Salaried Employee Benefit budget is projected to be 1.8% above the 2019 projected
benefit costs.
The low percent of increase in the cost to RTD is directly related to the following:
 Minimal increase in premium on the KAISER plans
 Increased percent of employee paid premium for the CIGNA plans.
 Rate guarantee for Vision plan
 Rate guarantee for Unum (Life/LTD)
 Rate guarantee for the Delta EPO plan
The 2020 estimate of the Salaried Employee Health and Welfare Benefits is $11,879,972.30. This is an
increase of $213,935.13.
For 2020, the benefit costs will be budgeted in the 2020 annual budget.

Wagon Road PnR/144th FlexRide

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into a 4 (Four) year contract with Smart
Commute Metro North Transportation Management Organization for the implementation and ongoing
grant administration of the new Wagon Road PnR/144th FlexRide. The grant includes $1,600,000 in
initial funding and $400,000 in local match for a total grant amount of $2,000,000. The total not to
exceed RTD contribution to this grant is $150,000.
It is also recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to amend the current ADA paratransit/FlexRide services
contract with Via Mobility Services (contract #16-DH-047) to allow RTD to distribute grant funds to VIA
Mobility Services to operate the new Wagon Road/144th FlexRide. The contract increase for the new
FlexRide service is $303,161 for year 1; $317,099 for year 2; and $331,927 for year 3. In addition,
RTD will reimburse the contractor’s direct fuel costs in an amount estimated to be $36,840 for year 1;
$37,945 for year 2; and $39,050 for year 3. The fourth year cost for the Wagon Road/144th FlexRide
service will not be included in this amendment since contract 16-DH-047 will be rebid during 2022. The
initial 3-year not-to-exceed amount for service is $952,186; and fuel is $113,835.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services
BACKGROUND
As part of the 2020-2023 Transportation Improvement Program, Smart Commute Metro North
Transportation Management Organization applied for and was awarded a grant to provide FlexRide
service in the northern area of the RTD district. Smart Commute was awarded $1,600,000 which is
conditional on a $400,000 local match for a total of $2,000,000. Local match sources include the
RTD, Adams County communities including Westminster and Thornton and private sector partners.
DISCUSSION
A special public meeting for the new Wagon Road/144th FlexRide was held September 16, 2019 at
Cabela’s in Thornton. At the public meeting, there were 15 members from the public in attendance and
Director Buzek from District J present. Staff members presented details on the new FlexRide including
service routing and start date to which all members of the public supported the new FlexRide proposal.
The area served by the new FlexRide can be described as 136th Avenue to the south, the Amazon
Distribution Center to the north, Huron to the west, Washington Street to the east and connecting
service at Wagon Road PnR to the far south. Please see attached Proposed Wagon Road/144th FlexRide
map for further detail. The FlexRide will serve numerous businesses in the northern area and provide
connection opportunities with the Route 8 and Wagon Road PnR. In this area there are multifamily
units, St. Anthony’s North Medical Campus, Amazon Distribution Center, the Orchard Town Center, The

Packet Pg. 185

12.L

Grove and Denver Premium Outlet Mall. The evening service provided by this FlexRide will provide
transportation options for the employees at St. Anthony’s, Amazon and a variety of other retail
employers.
The proposed Wagon Road PnR/144th FlexRide will provide approximately 7,415 annual revenue hours
and serve the RTD Wagon Road PnR, Monday-Saturday 4:50a-9:45pm. Two vehicles will operate during
peak hours, 4:50am – 8:45am and 5:50pm-9:45pm with timed meets at the Wagon Road Park-n-Ride.
One vehicle will operate during non-peak hours offering service based on demand with no timed meets.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
RTD will be the recipient of the $2,000,000 grant and will distribute grant funds during the 4-year term
($1,600,000 budgeted funds and $400,000 through local match). The grant funding will pay for the
FlexRide services, staffing, marketing, promotions, other non-transit mobility options, minor
infrastructure transit improvements, and the purchase of two additional cutaway buses. RTD’s total
contribution to the grant will be $150,000 over the first three years of the grant and no financial
commitment during the fourth year of the grant. RTD’s $150,000 contribution includes a $75,000
“challenge grant” whereby, $75,000 of the $150,000 will not be paid by RTD unless Smart Commute
meets specific goals for selling RTD Fare media.

It is also recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to amend the current ADA
paratransit/FlexRide services contract with Via Mobility Services (contract #16-DH-047) to allow
RTD to distribute grant funds to VIA Mobility Services to operate the new Wagon Road/144 th
FlexRide. The contract increase for the new FlexRide service is $303,161 for year 1; $317,099;
and $331,927 for year 3. In addition, RTD will reimburse the contractor’s direct fuel costs in an
amount estimated to be $36,840 for year 1; $37,945 for year 2; and $39,050 for year 3. The
fourth year cost for the Wagon Road/144th FlexRide service will not be included in this
amendment since contract 16-DH-047 will be rebid during 2022. The initial 3-year not-to-exceed
amount for service is $952,186; and fuel is $113,835.
2) Do not enter into contract with Smart Commute Metro North Transportation Management
Organization and do not assign new services to Via Mobility Services. This is not recommended
as the grant that was awarded establishes a framework for the RTD to partner with
transportation management organizations, businesses and local communities to establish new
services in areas not currently served by the RTD. Additionally, Smart Commute would need to
pursue a private transportation service provider which would create significant barriers to
integrating these services and the fares generated into the RTD network. If Smart Commute
decided not pursue private transportation services, the grant funding would not be distributed and
this community would not have transit services.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Board of Directors

Date: October 24, 2019

From:

Barbara G McManus,
Board Office

Date:

October 24, 2019

Subject:

Draft Board Expense Reduction Resolution

Executive

Manager,

GM
Board Meeting Date:

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Executive Committee of the RTD Board of Directors that the Board approve a
motion to adopt the attached Resolution No. ______, Series of 2019, concerning a Temporary Reduction
of Certain Board Office Budget Lines Related to Director Travel and the Allocation of Certain Meeting
Expenses to Directors’ Local Expense Budgets.
This recommendation is consistent with the General Manager’s 2019 Core Goal #3 - Strong Financial
Management.
BACKGROUND
Directors are eligible for reimbursement from the District for reasonable local and travel expenses
incurred that are necessary to the transaction of official District business. Out-of-District registration
fees for the first two sanctioned events for each Director are not charged against the Director’s
expenses and are instead paid for using Board Office funds.
In 2009 and again in 2011, the Board unanimously adopted resolutions reducing the Board members’
spending limits on their local and travel expenses as economic downturns required a reduction in overall
agency spending.
DISCUSSION
The attached resolution, for Fiscal Year 2020 only:




Reduces by $2,000 the amount allocated to each Directors’ travel expense budget;
Reduces by half, or $12,750, the amount budgeted by the Board Office to defray the cost of
Directors’ registration fees incurred in order to attend out-of-District transit-related conferences;
and
Authorizes the Board Office to allocate a debit in a certain amount toward each Director’s local
expense account for expenses incurred by the Board Office on behalf of the Director in the course
of preparing for official meetings of the Board and its committees.

ALTERNATIVES
1. To adopt the attached resolution.
2. To reject the resolution. Rejection of this resolution would necessitate further cuts to certain line
items in the Board Office budget in order to balance the Board Office’s component of the 2020
requested agency budget.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Adoption of this resolution would result in an estimated General Fund savings of at least $51,000 during
Fiscal Year 2020.

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT

Temporary Reduction of Certain Board Office Budget Lines Related to Director Travel and
Allocation of Certain Meeting Expenses to Directors’ Local Expense Budgets
WHEREAS, The Regional Transportation District (RTD) has 15 elected Board members who
serve their constituents on a daily basis throughout the community, at committee meetings,
study sessions, and Board meetings, and at the legislature, and
WHEREAS, there is an increasing need and desire of the community to hear of RTD’s
evolving plans and projects; and
WHEREAS, Board members’ direct contact with constituents puts a public face on RTD and
gives community members the opportunity to share ideas and concerns with their elected
officials; and
WHEREAS, in order to learn current information and keep updated on a myriad of
transportation issues and new innovations across the nation, it is important for Directors to
experience first-hand other transit agencies and issues they face; and
WHEREAS, in order to grasp new ever-changing transit technology, it is important for the
Directors to attend conferences and formal presentations and meet with peers from other
transit agencies to discuss issues similar to those experienced by RTD; and
WHEREAS, in recognition of the effect of the economic downturn in the Denver metropolitan
region, however, and the concomitant reduction in sales and use tax revenues, the Board
believes it appropriate to reduce the local expense limits allocated to the RTD Board
members;
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that for Fiscal Year 2020 only:
1) The amount allocated to each Director’s travel expense budget shall be reduced by
$2,000;
2) The amount budgeted by the Board Office to defray the cost of Directors’ registration
fees incurred in order to attend out-of-District transit-related conferences shall be
reduced by half; and
3) That the Board Office is authorized to allocate a debit in a certain amount toward
each Director’s local expense account for expenses incurred by the Board Office on
