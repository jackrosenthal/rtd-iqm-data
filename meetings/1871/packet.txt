• “…FTA believes that because of the large demand for

Program Changes: Continued

• “… by replacing travel time savings with trips in the
measure of cost-effectiveness, projects that serve
more riders, rather than those that reduce travel time
for riders are likely to be favored. Riders making
longer trips tend to be riders from higher-income
suburban communities.”

• Project sponsors must prepare current year forecast
– Current year = most recent year for which data on current transit use
and demographic factors are available (i.e., “as close to today as data
will permit”)
– If project sponsor includes horizon year, it must be weighted
50%/50% with current year

• For the Mobility Improvements criterion, transit
dependent trips count twice

• Only project expenditures made after entry into Project
Development can be applied as local share

• FTA’s definition of BRT determines eligibility for funding
• Transit agencies’ definitions of BRT do not necessarily
conform to FTA’s definition
• Each transit agency has a different approach to BRT
implementation due to the characteristics of each corridor
• BRT is a system of elements – no single element makes
BRT successful; the best investments are unique to the
corridor

RTD BRT projects

Bus Rapid Transit Comparison
Elements of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT)

Types of BRT guideways range from exclusive busways to various kinds of managed lanes. In some cases,
buses operate on shoulders in heavy traffic. Some systems allow BRT buses to jump ahead of lines of
traffic at lights (this is called a “queue jump”).
Stations
Stations often feature amenities such as programmable information displays (PIDs) showing real-time
arrivals, ticket vending machines, and level boarding. Distinctive station designs and branding are
common elements of BRT systems. BRT stations can support transit-oriented development in certain
cases.
Vehicles
Vehicles range from typical over-the-road coaches similar to those that RTD uses for regional service to
low-floor, multiple-door buses. Some agencies use low-emission vehicles. Interior conveniences can
include WiFi, enhanced lighting, and large windows. Vehicle capacity varies significantly from one
agency to another.
Fare Collection
Some agencies collect fares on-board using a smart card system while others emphasize off-board fare
collection via ticket vending machines at stations and/or monthly and annual passes.
Technology and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS)
Intelligent transportation systems allow BRT vehicles to move more quickly than surrounding traffic. A
common ITS element is signal priority: the bus actually causes traffic signals to stay green longer than
they do for cars.
Service
Frequent service and long service hours are typically part of a BRT system. Headways vary significantly
from one system to the next. Generally BRT systems have shorter headways during peak hours, and
these can range from under five minutes to 15 minutes. Headways during non-peak times may be 20
minutes to an hour depending on the system and the time of day.

Section 5301
(a) DECLARATION OF POLICY.—It is in the interest of the United States, including the
economic interest of the United States, to foster the development and revitalization of public
transportation systems with the cooperation of both public transportation companies and private
companies engaged in public transportation.
(b) GENERAL PURPOSES.—The purposes of this chapter are to—
(1) provide funding to support public transportation;
(2) improve the development and delivery of capital projects;
(3) establish standards for the state of good repair of public transportation infrastructure and
vehicles;
(4) promote continuing, cooperative, and comprehensive planning that improves the performance
of the transportation network;
(5) establish a technical assistance program to assist recipients under this chapter to more

capable of providing quantitative information about alcohol or a controlled substance;

United States; and
