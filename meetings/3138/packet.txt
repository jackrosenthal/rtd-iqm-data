Security Model Reorg Phased Approach

2021 Phase (1) One Reorg
Begin the phased process of a complete security model change, which would eliminate the
use of Armed Security Officers as “First Responders” in mobile patrol Cars and as “Fare
Enforcement throughout the Commuter Rail System.
Armed Transit Security Officers would still be present at “pre-determined” platforms and
facilities for rapid response to security incidents and will be supported by RTD Transit Police
Officers.
✓ Complete existing 2020 vacancy recruitments of (4) Four additional Transit Police
Officers and (3) Three new Sergeant Positions.
✓ Recruit and Train (6) Six additional Transit Police Officers, (1) One Grant Funded K-9
Officer.
✓ Recruit (1) One Crime Analyst.
✓ Recruit (1) One 911 Supervisor Training & Quality Assurance and (1) One 911 Programs
Administrator.
✓ Begin to “Phase-out” TSO Fare Inspectors on Commuter Rail and “Reallocating” existing
funding to Commuter Rail Operations to finance “Conductors.”

2022 Phase (2) Two Reorg
In 2022, the Transit Police Division will continue to build upon the operational foundation to
provide security response capabilities, supervision, security contractor auditing and oversight,
and records management. Auditing and oversight would include RTD staff that would make
daily observations of contracted security for compliance. This phase will also include more
patrol and response abilities, with the eventual goal to eliminate TSO’s acting in an armed
response mobile capacity.
✓ Recruit (1) One additional Operations Lieutenant, (1) One Audit & Internal Affairs
Sergeant, (1) One Training Sergeant and (1) One Patrol Sergeant & (4) Four Corporals.
✓ Recruit (8) Eight additional Transit Police Officers.
✓ Recruit (1) One full-time agency Emergency Manager.
✓ Recruit (1) One Security Audit “Field Inspector.”
✓ Recruit (1) One Records Custodian.

2023 Phase (3) Three Reorg
In 2023 the Transit Police Division will continue to transition to a smaller, easier to manage
footprint of contracted TSO armed security officers. In this phase the goal is to focus on linelevel Transit Police Officers and to complete the process of “foundation building.”

2024 Phase (4) Four Reorg
In 2024 the Transit Police Division will focus on building additional Transit Police Officers that
will be strategically deployed in field operations with bus and train operators. In this phase,
TSO’s will be primarily used solely for facility and platform security assignments.
✓ Recruit (16) Sixteen entry level Transit Police Officers.
✓ Recruit (2) Two additional 911 Public Safety Dispatchers

2025 Phase (5) Five Final Reorg Phase
In 2025 the Transit Police Division will complete the multi-year process of recruiting and
training Transit Police Officers that would be needed to support the mission of the RTD. At the
completion of this phase, we would expect the entire agency to be utilizing “Conductors” for all
modes of train travel. TSO’s would be required to meet stringent experience requirements and
would only be authorized to work at assigned facilities. The TSO’s primary role will be customer
service, safety & security, and to observe and report criminal activity to law enforcement. At the
completion of this phase, TSO’s would only physically engage in justifiable emergent situations.
RTD Transit Police Officers (Internal & External) would also be assigned to assist at key facilities
to provide oversight and assistance.
✓ Recruit (16) Sixteen entry level Transit Police Officers.
✓ Recruit (2) Two additional 911 Public Safety Dispatchers

Packet Pg. 5

Attachment: Board Ad-Hoc Recommended Reorg (4389 : Recommended Reorg)

✓ Recruit (2) Two Corporals to finish supervisory capabilities.
✓ Recruit (14) Fourteen entry level Transit Police Officers.
✓ Recruit (2) Two additional 911 Public Safety Dispatchers.
