Migration of Legacy Software (17DK001). This contract was originally awarded

competitive bid process. The contract allowed for an initial year plus four one
year options to renew based on positive performance by the vendor. In order to
continue the 3rd year option additional funding must be added to the contract not

$915,000.

competitive bid process. The contract allowed for an initial-year plus four (4)
one-year options to be renewed based on positive performance by the vendor.
The final option has been executed and the period of performance extended to
