Zero Emission Policy

The Regional Transportation District (RTD), under the General Manager and CEO’s
leadership, shall achieve net zero emissions by 2050 as measured by Scope 1 and Scope 2
emissions as defined by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. RTD's Board shall reevaluate this
policy after receiving an asset transition plan (or similarly named plan which details RTD’s
plans to transition to a zero emission fleet) (“Transition Plan”) and no less than annually to
measure progress towards this policy.
Beginning with the November 2023 Operations and Safety Committee meeting, staff shall
present monthly updates to the Board of Directors until such time as the Transition Plan
can be completed.
In the event including Scope 2 emissions will delay the completion of the Transition Plan,
staff shall apprise the Board of Directors of the same and the Board of Directors may elect
to remove the Scope 2 emissions portion of the Transition Plan.
In the event working towards this policy is in conflict with RTD’s ability to deliver service,
staff shall bring a recommended action to the Board to weigh the options against this
policy and to determine whether adjustment is necessary.

Grant Agreement with Colorado Energy Office to
Implement 2023 Ozone Season Transit Grant Program

May 9, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
May 31, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO or her designee to enter an
Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with the Colorado Energy Office and to authorize the transfer of up
to $2,200,000 from the Unrestricted Fund to effectuate the 2023 Ozone Season Transit Grant
Agreement.

PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
Enacted in 2022, Senate Bill 22-180 created the Ozone Season Transit Grant Program (grant program)
within the Colorado Energy Office. The grant program allows RTD and other state transit agencies to
apply for funding to implement a minimum of 30 days’ zero-fare transit service for all transit services
offered. House Bill 23-1101, which was subsequently enacted in 2023, made changes to the grant
program, removing the 20% match requirement for RTD and increasing the amount of available funding
during the 2023 grant cycle.
In August 2022, RTD implemented a Zero Fare for Better Air period, whereby the agency offered zerofare transit across all transit modes. Compared to July 2022 data, ridership increased 22% during the
fare-free period in August 2022. Additionally, the agency did not experience any major operational
impacts during the Zero Fare for Better Air period, nor did quality-of-life or crime-related incident reports
increase.
Overall, RTD experienced a 22% increase in ridership during the Zero Fare for Better Air period, which
ran from August 1 through August 30, 2023. Furthermore, customers and stakeholders expressed
satisfaction and provided positive feedback regarding the experience of utilizing the agency’s services
during the Zero Fare for Better Air period.
DISCUSSION
Staff is recommending the transfer of up to $2,200,000 from the Unrestricted Fund to be used to
implement a Zero Fare for Better Air period during the months of July and August 2023.

Packet Pg. 21

16.A

Through the removal of the 20% match requirement for RTD and the availability of additional funding in
2023, RTD is able to invest a similar amount of funding as compared to 2022 and fully fund a Zero Fare
for Better Air program to deliver two months of zero-fare transit services in 2023.
As outlined by the feedback received following the 2022 Zero Fare for Better Air period, seeking to
utilize all available grant funding to deliver an additional month of zero-fare transit services would align
with the agency Strategic Priorities of Community Value, Customer Excellence, and Financial Success.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The financial impact associated with the provision of two months of zero-fare transit, in July and August
2023, is estimated to be up to $2,200,000 in RTD funds, which will be combined with those derived
from the grant program. The funds will be used to offset a portion of fare revenue not collected during
the zero-fare period. Further, these funds will be used for marketing and advertising expenses and
expenses related to gathering customer feedback.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Proposed 2023-2024 Internal Audit Plan

May 9, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
May 31, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the 2023-2024 Internal Audit Plan.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Audit Committee Charter was approved by the Board on October 25, 2022, which requires the
Audit Committee, consistent with the Internal Audit Function Charter and subject to Board approval, to:
•

Recommend approval of the risk-based annual audit plan and all major changes to the plan

The annual audit plan directs the activities of the internal audit function performed by RubinBrown, LLP
for RTD. Each internal audit project is developed based on the annual enterprise risk assessment with the
intent to perform audits which provide the greatest impact to RTD’s ability to achieve its strategic plan
and goals. The annual audit plan may be modified at any time by the Chief Audit Executive to adjust for
changing circumstances and new information. Any proposed significant deviation from the approved
internal audit plan must be communicated in advance to Executive Leadership and the Audit Committee
and approved by the Board. Internal audit results will be communicated to the Audit Committee at least
quarterly. Audit Committee activities will be reported to the Board at each Board meeting.
DISCUSSION
The Proposed 2023-2024 Internal Audit Plan recommends audits to be undertaken through the end of
2024. Each proposed audit has been selected in response to the results of the enterprise risk
assessment which was most recently updated to include input from Executive Leadership, the Audit
Committee, and the Board in early 2023, and presented to the Audit Committee on April 6, 2023. In
addition, each proposed audit has an estimate of the number of hours necessary to complete the audit.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The contract for internal audit services with RubinBrown was approved by the Board on June 28, 2022,
for three years plus two option years with a not-to-exceed value over five years of $3,212,105. The
financial impact has been included in the 2023 Budget.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Allied Universal Security Services Second Contract Option
Year

May 10, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
May 31, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO), or her designee, to
execute the second option year of the existing security services contract with Allied Universal Security
(AUS) for a total cost not to exceed $20,455,408.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Dr. Joel Fitzgerald, Chief of Police and Emergency Management
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
The current RTD security model consists of internal police officers, secondary employment officers from
local jurisdictions, and contracted security officers to provide security for RTD customers, facilities, and
property.
On July 11, 2019, following a comprehensive procurement process, AUS was awarded a three-year
contract with three one-year options to provide system-wide security services. The initial contract term
expired June 30, 2022, and RTD executed the first option year term from July 1, 2022, to June 30,
2023. A second option year term would further extend the contract from July 1, 2023, to June 30,
2024.
Currently, the range of services provided under the contract terms include but are not limited to:
• Critical infrastructure security at RTD facilities including bus and rail stations
• Fare enforcement
• Patrol services
• Enhanced security presence during large-scale events
• Integrated security technology services
• Security command and dispatch center staffing and monitoring
DISCUSSION
Staff recommends that the Board authorize the GM/CEO to execute the second option year of the three
one-year options for AUS to continue providing system-wide security services.
In adopting this recommended action, the agency seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan priorities
of Community Value and Customer Excellence. Specifically:

Packet Pg. 34

17.C

• The perceived value of RTD in terms of Community Value would be enhanced through:
o The hiring of additional unarmed security officers to serve in ambassador and customer
service roles, and
o Continued deployment of contracted security personnel in higher visibility uniforms,
yielding a greater sense of employee, customer, and overall community security in areas
RTD serves.
• Increased Customer Excellence would be achieved through the continued ability to deploy
unarmed security guards on commuter rail services, thereby improving system reliability and
decreasing delays
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The financial impact associated with the adoption of the recommended action is $20,455,408, of which
$10,227,704 will be accounted for within the FY2023 Amended Budget. The remaining funds require
incorporation into the FY2024 Budget. Moreover, due to the reduction in the scope of services over the
life of the contract, the cost of the second option year is $4,256,448 less than the original projected
cost for this option year.
