It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to approve a contract amendment to Jacobs Engineering for Program Support Consulting Services (PSC) for FasTracks, to extend the contract completion date from June 30, 2017 to December 31, 2019.  Funding for project scope to be completed in 2017 is included in the 2017 Adopted Budget for the FasTracks capital program in the specific projects where PSC support would be utilized.  Funding for future year scope is included in the 2016 Annual Program Evaluation for 2018-2019 in the specific projects where PSC support would be utilized, and will be appropriated in the specific projects in future year capital budgets.

Motion:               Director Deadwyler made the motion to approve the Contract Extension for Jacobs Engineering for FasTracks Program Support Consulting Services.

Director Folska seconded the motion.

Discussion:               Director Lubow asked what portion of the contracts under discussion related to the problem contractors had with specific corridors.  She stated that she wants to see the cost in overtime used for additional work due to problems.

Henry Stopplecamp, Assistant General Manager of Capital Programs, stated that he looked at the original completion schedule for the G Line and R Line and figured out how many additional hours would be needed. He stated that one of the agency’s challenges is trying to figure out the end date of the North Metro Corridor.  He stressed without an estimated end date he cannot give a definitive answer but he estimates that RTD will spend approximately $4-7 Million to cover overhead extension of staff for 2017-2020.  He said that amount will encompass all three contracts with Jacob, Triunity-Hill, and Front Range.

Director Deadwyler asked Mr. Stopplecamp if the amounts he is proposing are only estimates and could they go higher.

Mr. Stopplecamp replied that, although his projections are estimates they should not go any higher than $7 Million dollars and RTD will only pay what is required.  He also mentioned that a completion timeframe for the Northern Corridor is needed to provide a better estimate.

Director Deadwyler asked if there is any additional money left over from this proposal, where would the money go.  She asked if it will go back into the general fund.

Mr. Stopplecamp stated that any monies allocated through FasTracks stays within that FasTracks project.

Director Lubow stated her frustration with overages that will be taken away from the Northwest Rail Line.

Director Solano seconded the motion.

Discussion:               Director Menten asked Mr. Stopplecamp if Tri-Unity Hill and Front Range were the contracts that are driving up the additional costs for these programs due to poor planning.

Director Folska asked Ms. McKillop if she could share other customers that use Kronos.

### H. Non-Profit Program 2017

In addition, any new program applicant will be put on a wait list as well as any existing agency that did not order in 2016. New participants in 2017 will be limited to what they already ordered. Any entity that has ordered at or above what they ordered in 2016 will not be able to order any additional product in 2017. The remaining face value at the end of May 2017 will be divided proportionally among the remaining participants based on their proportional value of the orders placed in 2016 to the total value of all orders in 2016.

Main

Motion:               Director Tisdale made the motion to approve the Non-Profit Program 2017.

Director Menten read, “It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Non-Profit program continue to maintain a $6,800,000 face value amount for 2017.  In addition, any new program applicant will be put on a wait list as well as any existing agency that did not order in 2016.  New participants in 2017 will be limited to what they already ordered.  Any entity that has ordered at or above what they ordered in 2016 will not be able to order any additional product in 2017.  The remaining face value at the end of May 2017 will be divided proportionally among the remaining participants based on their proportional value of the orders placed in 2016 to the total value of all orders in 2016.

Primary

Motion to

Amend:               Director Broom made the motion to approve Non-Profit Program 2017 - Amendment

Director Anderson seconded the motion.

Discussion:               Director Folska asked if the $6.8 Million dollars in question is half of the street value for bus passes.

Ms. McKillop stated the actual value is half of the face value.  She said that in return RTD will receive half of the $6.8 Million needed to provide the passes.

Director Folska stated that if the program were discontinued, the impact to the amount of revenue received would be $3.4 Million.

Ms. McKillop confirmed the amount.

Director Anderson stated that she believes that the program received a $1 Million increase over 2015 and is satisfied with that amount.  She stated that since RTD is near the half year mark, the agency should continue the way it is distributing passes.  She stressed any changes should be made next year.

Chair Hoy clarified that the amount in question represents an increase from last year but it represents an amount that the Board approved in the 2016 budget.  He also stated that this process with this program is costly and the agency needs to control it or it can hurt RTD.  He stated that this was a quick system to control the amount of passes being sold.  He also said that this may or may not be something that the Pass Group looks at.

Ms. McKillop stated that it is recommended that the non-profit pass be evaluated by the Pass Program Working Group.  She stated that recommendations made by the Pass Working Group will be brought back to the Board in fall of 2017. She stressed to the Board that they are only voting on approval for 2017 monies designated to this program; she stated that the 2018 expenditure approval process will come to them at a later time.

Director Menten stated that it was her understanding that the motion only places a cap on spending for the program for 2017.  She said that she was under the impression that it was not the intent to put the Non-Profit Program under the Pass Program umbrella.  She expressed that she will pull her support for this motion if the Non-Profit Pass is reviewed under the Working Pass Program.  She asked Ms. McKillop to clarify if the Non-Profit Program will be evaluated by the Pass Program.

Ms. McKillop stated that the pass program was set up to review all of RTD’s fare revenue and the Non-Profit Program falls under fare revenue.  She reiterated that the Non-Profit Program is a discounted pass program.

Director Menten stated that the Eco Pass and the Student Pass are entirely different things. She explained that the Eco Pass is paid for by a company that enrolls all of its employees.  She stated that she will be voting no.

Director Williams agreed with Ms. McKillop that the Pass Program Working Group designed to look at all passes.  She stated that she is in agreement to finish off the year as it is but she said that in moving forward, the Pass Program should be involved with future sales.

Director Tisdale stated the issue at hand was a problem in the Non-Profit Program that required staff to provide a stop-gap solution.

Director Francone asked Ms. McKillop if the $1 Million increase includes the overages of $700,000 from last year’s budget.

Ms. McKillop stated that the motion only affected the program for 2017.

Director Folska asked if RTD could easily recover $3.4 Million in fare revenue.

Ms. McKillop stated that bus drivers would find a way to purchase tickets even without the program.

Director Lubow stated that she believes that the Pass Program Working Group should be involved in reviewing the Non-Profit Program.  She stated that she hopes that there is a clear explanation given to the public regarding the future of the program.

Chair Hoy said that it is very important to review the program sooner than later to avoid being in the same situation as last year.

Director Deadwyler asked how long it will take the Pass Program Working Group to review the Non-Profit Program.

Ms. McKillop stated that the goal is to have all fare media reviewed with recommendations by December 2017.
