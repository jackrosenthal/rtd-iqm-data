Recommended Action
C.
Approval of Contract Extension for Jacobs Engineering for FasTracks Program
Support Consulting Services
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the
RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to approve a contract
amendment to Jacobs Engineering for Program Support Consulting Services (PSC) for
FasTracks, to extend the contract completion date from June 30, 2017 to December
31, 2019. Funding for project scope to be completed in 2017 is included in the 2017
Adopted Budget for the FasTracks capital program in the specific projects where PSC
support would be utilized. Funding for future year scope is included in the 2016
Annual Program Evaluation for 2018-2019 in the specific projects where PSC support
would be utilized, and will be appropriated in the specific projects in future year capital
budgets.
Motion:

Director Deadwyler made the motion to approve the
Contract Extension for Jacobs Engineering for
FasTracks Program Support Consulting Services.
Director Folska seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Director Lubow asked what portion of the contracts under discussion
related to the problem contractors had with specific corridors. She
stated that she wants to see the cost in overtime used for additional
work due to problems.
Henry Stopplecamp, Assistant General Manager of Capital Programs,
stated that he looked at the original completion schedule for the G
Line and R Line and figured out how many additional hours would be
needed. He stated that one of the agency’s challenges is trying to
figure out the end date of the North Metro Corridor. He stressed
without an estimated end date he cannot give a definitive answer but
he estimates that RTD will spend approximately $4-7 Million to cover

overhead extension of staff for 2017-2020. He said that amount will
encompass all three contracts with Jacob, Triunity-Hill, and Front
Range.
Director Deadwyler asked Mr. Stopplecamp if the amounts he is
proposing are only estimates and could they go higher.
Mr. Stopplecamp replied that, although his projections are estimates
they should not go any higher than $7 Million dollars and RTD will
only pay what is required. He also mentioned that a completion
timeframe for the Northern Corridor is needed to provide a better
estimate.
Director Deadwyler asked if there is any additional money left over
from this proposal, where would the money go. She asked if it will
go back into the general fund.
Mr. Stopplecamp stated that any monies allocated through FasTracks
stays within that FasTracks project.
Director Lubow stated her frustration with overages that will be taken
away from the Northwest Rail Line.
Vote on
The Motion: The motion passed with 14 in favor (Anderson,
Archuleta, Broom, Deadwyler, Folska, Francone, Hoy,

Director Solano seconded the motion.

Discussion:

that he could not comment if poor planning was the reason for the
contract extension.

Discussion:

Non-Profit Program 2017

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the NonProfit program continue to maintain a $6,800,000 face value amount for 2017. In
addition, any new program applicant will be put on a wait list as well as any existing
agency that did not order in 2016. New participants in 2017 will be limited to what they
already ordered. Any entity that has ordered at or above what they ordered in 2016 will
not be able to order any additional product in 2017. The remaining face value at the end of
May 2017 will be divided proportionally among the remaining participants based on their
proportional value of the orders placed in 2016 to the total value of all orders in 2016.
Main
Motion:

Director Tisdale made the motion to approve the NonProfit Program 2017.

Director Anderson seconded the motion.
Discussion:

Chair Hoy stated that before he allowed anyone to speak to the
action he advised the Board that there was an amendment to the
motion. He asked Director Menten to read the Non-Profit Program
proposed recommended action amendment.
Director Menten read, “It is recommended by the Financial
Administration and Audit Committee that the Non-Profit program
continue to maintain a $6,800,000 face value amount for 2017. In
addition, any new program applicant will be put on a wait list as well
as any existing agency that did not order in 2016. New participants
in 2017 will be limited to what they already ordered. Any entity that

the end of May 2017 will be divided proportionally among the
remaining participants based on their proportional value of the orders
placed in 2016 to the total value of all orders in 2016.
Primary
Motion to
Amend:

Director Broom made the motion to approve Non-Profit
Program 2017 - Amendment
Director Anderson seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Director Folska asked if the $6.8 Million dollars in
question is half of the street value for bus passes.
Ms. McKillop stated the actual value is half of the face
value. She said that in return RTD will receive half of
the $6.8 Million needed to provide the passes.
Director Folska stated that if the program were
discontinued, the impact to the amount of revenue
received would be $3.4 Million.
Ms. McKillop confirmed the amount.
Director Anderson stated that she believes that the
program received a $1 Million increase over 2015 and

is satisfied with that amount. She stated that since
RTD is near the half year mark, the agency should
continue the way it is distributing passes. She stressed
any changes should be made next year.
Chair Hoy clarified that the amount in question
represents an increase from last year but it represents
an amount that the Board approved in the 2016
budget. He also stated that this process with this
program is costly and the agency needs to control it or
it can hurt RTD. He stated that this was a quick
system to control the amount of passes being sold. He
also said that this may or may not be something that
the Pass Group looks at.
Ms. McKillop stated that it is recommended that the
non-profit pass be evaluated by the Pass Program
Working Group. She stated that recommendations
made by the Pass Working Group will be brought back
to the Board in fall of 2017. She stressed to the Board
that they are only voting on approval for 2017 monies
designated to this program; she stated that the 2018
expenditure approval process will come to them at a
later time.
Director Menten stated that it was her understanding
that the motion only places a cap on spending for the
program for 2017. She said that she was under the
impression that it was not the intent to put the NonProfit Program under the Pass Program umbrella. She
expressed that she will pull her support for this motion
if the Non-Profit Pass is reviewed under the Working
Pass Program. She asked Ms. McKillop to clarify if the
Non-Profit Program will be evaluated by the Pass
Program.
Ms. McKillop stated that the pass program was set up
to review all of RTD’s fare revenue and the Non-Profit
Program falls under fare revenue. She reiterated that
the Non-Profit Program is a discounted pass program.

Director Menten stated that the Eco Pass and the
Student Pass are entirely different things. She explained
that the Eco Pass is paid for by a company that enrolls
all of its employees. She stated that she will be voting
no.
Director Williams agreed with Ms. McKillop that the
Pass Program Working Group designed to look at all
passes. She stated that she is in agreement to finish
off the year as it is but she said that in moving forward,
the Pass Program should be involved with future sales.
Director Tisdale stated the issue at hand was a problem
in the Non-Profit Program that required staff to provide
a stop-gap solution.
Director Francone asked Ms. McKillop if the $1 Million
increase includes the overages of $700,000 from last
year’s budget.
Ms. McKillop stated that the motion only affected the
program for 2017.
Director Folska asked if RTD could easily recover $3.4
Million in fare revenue.
Ms. McKillop stated that bus drivers would find a way
to purchase tickets even without the program.
Director Lubow stated that she believes that the Pass
Program Working Group should be involved in reviewing
the Non-Profit Program. She stated that she hopes that
there is a clear explanation given to the public regarding
the future of the program.

3142 : Non-Profit Program 2017 - Amendment
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the NonProfit program continue to maintain a $6,800,000 face value amount for 2017. In
addition, any new program applicant will be put on a wait list as well as any existing
agency that did not order in 2016. New participants in 2017 will be limited to what they
already ordered. Any entity that has ordered at or above what they ordered in 2016 will
not be able to order any additional product in 2017. The remaining face value at the end of
May 2017 will be divided proportionally among the remaining participants based on their
proportional value of the orders placed in 2016 to the total value of all orders in 2016.
