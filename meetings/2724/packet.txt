BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

Date: March 7, 2018

From:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

March 7, 2018

Board Meeting Date: March 27, 2018

Subject:

May 2018 Service Changes

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the May 2018 Service Change package as revised and summarized in Attachment A resulting in
an annualized cost savings of approximately $153,000 and, further, to authorize the General Manager or
his designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is
impacted by these changes.
The Recommended Action proposed falls in line with the following GM Goals:
Core Goal #1 - Successful Delivery of Transit Services
Task Goal #1 - Fiscal Sustainability

DISCUSSION
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. We will continue adjusting services in
response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. It is also
our responsibility to identify services that are underperforming and recommend modifications,
curtailment or cancellation of service as warranted or recommend new service as changes in the
community warrant and finances allow.
The proposals herein include a mix of service improvements, adjustments and reductions. Included herein
is a restructure of service to the US36 & Broomfield Station (Routes 112, 120 and 128). A number of
bus stop consolidations are also proposed affecting Routes 6, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 38 and 83, in an
effort to improve on-time performance and the overall attractiveness of our service to our customers. We
will monitor customer response to the implementation of these service changes and propose adjustments
and service alternatives as appropriate in future service change recommendations.
The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
 Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and

Response to changes in the communities where services are provided

SUMMARY OF PUBLIC MEETINGS
Five public meetings were conducted in Boulder, Broomfield, Southeast Denver and at the Blake
Administration Building between February 26th and March 1st. Comments and further details from these
meetings and the service change website are summarized in Attachment K of this report.
CHANGES TO INITIAL RECOMMENDATION
Staff receives input during the public comment process and continues to conduct additional analysis
after the initial service recommendations are communicated to the Board of Directors. Depending on the
outcome of the public comment process and continued analysis, staff may or may not propose
modifications to these initial recommendations. The following proposals have been significantly modified:
Route 0L – South Broadway limited: add new trip departing Civic Center Station at 3:58pm
Route 10 – 12th Avenue: bus stops at 12thAvenue Pennsylvania to be retained in both directions.
Route 11 – Mississippi Avenue: retain bus stops at W. Exposition Ave-Zuni St in both directions, retain
bus stop at W. Exposition Ave-Federal Blvd (nearside) and discontinue stop at W. Exposition Ave-Federal
Blvd. (farside).
Route 16/16L – West Colfax: retain bus stops at W. 14th Ave. - Irving St and W. Colfax Ave-Perry St in
both directions. Do not relocate the 16L stop from Perry to Raleigh
Route 38 – 38th Avenue: retain westbound bus stop at W. 38th Ave.- Lipan St. and discontinue
westbound bus stop at W. 38th Ave.- Kalamath St.
Route 228 – Louisville/Broomfield: run time analyses uncovered a need to add resources to improve ontime performance, as well as to provide recovery time for bus operators on the weekends.
Bolt – Boulder/Longmont: run time analyses uncovered a need to add resources to improve on-time
performance, as well as to provide recovery time for bus operators on the weekends.
Route FF – Flat iron Flyer: run time analyses uncovered a need to add resources to improve on-time
performance, as well as to provide recovery time for bus operators on the weekends.

Routes proposed for mixed service improvements/ service Efficiencies:
A number of bus stop consolidations are proposed, in an overall effort to improve the attractiveness of
our service. The aim of bus stop consolidation is to provide the appropriate spacing between bus stops,
thereby reducing travel time and increasing on-time performance.
Route 6 – East 6th Avenue: bus stops consolidation.
Route 10 – East 12th Avenue: afternoon peak trips to operate to/from Elitch’s only, not Colfax/Federal
and bus stop consolidation.

allow for connections at US36 & Broomfield Station. (see attachment C)
Route 120 – 120th Avenue/ Brighton: realign routing between US36 & Broomfield Station terminal and
120th Avenue. (see attachment D)
Route 128 – Broomfield/Wagon Road: realign routing between US36 & Broomfield Station terminal and
Midway Boulevard. (see attachment E)
Route 131 – Iliff: schedule adjustments.

Packet Pg. 5

1.B.1

Route 153 – Chamber Road: reroute south of Aurora Metro Center (see attachment G)
Route 228 – Louisville/Broomfield: run time analyses requiring significant schedule change
Route AB – Boulder/ Denver Airport: schedule adjustment impacting Boulder Station departures.
Bolt – Boulder/Longmont: run time analyses requiring significant schedule change
Route FF – Flat iron Flyer: run time analyses requiring significant schedule change
Free MetroRide: minor schedule adjustments.

Routes proposed for routine running time analysis/schedule adjustments:
Route 0 – South Broadway: minor schedule adjustments.
Route 0L – South Broadway Limited: minor schedule adjustments.
Changing to summer service levels for routes BOUND, DASH, JUMP, SKIP, and STAMPEDE Other route
related interline changes as result of a change to summer service levels: (204, 225,206/206F, 208/208F
and Y.
C, D, and L Lines: minor running time adjustments are proposed for the C, D, and L Lines on all service
days as a result of the major change from January that will require some refinement of timing. This will
not alter the trips and the same service will be provided. No cost impacts are anticipated.
Due to ongoing labor negotiations there may be a need to make schedule adjustments not currently
listed in this proposal. Any subsequent changes necessary will be listed in the Final Service Change
Brochure prior to the implementation to be consistent with Board policy on public notification.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The overall financial impact contained in this proposal includes a base system cost savings of
approximately $153,000 annualized and a reduced requirement of 3 weekday equivalent full time
employees.
EQUITY ANALYSIS
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and
Executive Order 12898 regarding Environmental Justice. In this circular, the FTA requires RTD to
evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that exceed the established major service
change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a disproportionately negative impact on
minority or low-income populations. Our evaluation of the proposed May 2018 service changes does not
reveal any disparities in impacts absorbed by minority or low-income populations.

During the midday, it is proposed to shift the scheduled DTC trips by 30 minutes, and
eliminate the Swedish Hospital loop. Four passengers currently board four trips in this
area. This proposed change would redistribute layover, resulting in the saving of one
midday bus. Alternative service is available on Route 12 and the Englewood Trolley (the
former ART Shuttle) along Downing Street and Hampden Avenue. Anticipated cost
savings is estimated to be $97,400 annualized.

Route 42 – Montbello via Albrook/GVR
Route 45 – Montbello via 51st/GVR
Route 169 – Buckley Road
Reroute westbound buses at the Walmart at Tower/Salida to operate clockwise with the
shopping center parking lot, exiting on Salida Street via Walden Street. This change
results in a much safer turning movement onto westbound Salida Street. Also, running
time analysis for Routes 42 and 45. No cost impacts are anticipated.
Route 43 – Martin Luther King Blvd.
Due to low ridership, discontinuance of the following weekday trips is proposed:
- 4:29am eastbound (8 passengers)
- 4:59am eastbound (8 passengers)
- 5:10am westbound (10 passengers)
- 6:40pm westbound (12 passengers)
Overall effect of these changes is to slightly reduce the length of time 15-minute service
frequency is provided on weekdays. Anticipated cost savings are estimated to be
$58,500
Route 46 – South Dahlia
Extend the route from its southern most terminal at Colorado Center Station to the
University Hills area on Saturday and Sundays. This will require an additional weekend
vehicle and approximately 10 platform hours. Anticipated cost is estimated to be
$84,000 annualized
Route 55L – Olde Town Arvada Limited
Minor schedule adjustments, (as a reminder the Route 55L will be discontinued with the
implementation of the G Line).
Route 62 – Commerce City/ Dick’s Sporting Good Park
Reduce mid-day frequency to hourly, due to low ridership. Current ridership levels in the
midday are 3.7 boardings per hour (without school trippers). Cost savings impacts result in
a reduction of a midday operator and vehicle required to operate the service. Financial
impacts are null due to grant funding.

Attachment: Atch A - May 2018 Service Changes (3412 : May 2018 Service Changes)

This proposal discontinues the following weekday trips due to low ridership:
- 3:43 am northbound (6 passengers)
- 11:05pm northbound (7 passengers)
- 11:55pm southbound (7 passengers)
This change would change the scheduled first trip of the day northbound being offered at
4:38am and the last trip of the day at 10:05pm. The last trip offered southbound would
be changed to start at 10:55pm. Anticipated cost savings is estimated to be $68,200
annualized.

Atch A – May 2018 Service Changes

Route 128 – Broomfield/Wagon Road
Realign routing between US36 & Broomfield Station terminal and Midway Boulevard via
Destination Drive, SH128 (bridge), (new) Wadsworth Boulevard, 118th Avenue, Commerce
Street and Nickel Street, to allow for better distribution of transit connections in this area.
Running time adjustments to improve on-time performance. No cost impacts are
anticipated.
Route 131 - Iliff
Minor schedule adjustments. No cost impacts are anticipated.
Route 153 – Chamber Road
Reroute south of Aurora Metro Center via Exposition Avenue instead of Alameda Parkway.
The passengers that currently board at the stop on Alameda Parky would be
accommodated by a new stop on Exposition.
No cost impacts are anticipated.
Route 169L – Buckley Road/DIA
Cut back southern terminal to Smoky Hill/Pheasant Run Parkway for northbound trips, and
Smoky Hill/Buckley for southbound trips. Minimal impact on ridership (10 passengers on
11 trips), eliminates duplication with Route 169, results in faster, more reliable scheduled
operations. Anticipated cost savings is estimated to be $29,000 annualized.
Route AB – Boulder/ Denver Airport
Move current 5:58am leave Downtown Boulder Station trip to leave from Boulder Junction
at Depot Square Station; move current 4:50pm and 5:50pm leave Denver Airport Station
to arrive at Boulder Junction at Depot Square Station vs. current arrive at Downtown
Boulder Station. No cost impacts are anticipated.
BuffRide
This service has been provided by RTD to CU home football games since approximately
1975. BuffRide service is currently offered from 11 Park-n-Ride locations. In 2017 Folsom
Field attendance averaged 43,320 per game. Recommend discontinuing low productivity
routes and eliminating routes where duplicate service exists.
Low productivity routes are: Route CB44 - Nine Mile (alternative H-Line transfer MALL or
C/E-Lines transfer to Flat Iron Flyer), Route CB52 - Southmoor/Broadway (alternative HLine transfer MALL to C/E-Lines transfer to Flat Iron Flyer), Route CB6 - Federal Center
(alternative W-Line to Flat Iron Flyer); no alternative service exists for passengers traveling
from Wadsworth & Hampden (14 passengers per trip). And eliminating routes where
duplicate service exists, Route CB12 - US36 & Sheridan / US36 & Broomfield / US36 &
McCaslin (alternative Flat Iron Flyer). Cost savings estimated to be $30,830.

CU/CSU
RTD provides Special Service to the annual Rocky Mountain Showdown between the
Colorado Buffaloes and the Colorado State University Rams; the game usually falls on
Labor Day weekend. With few exceptions, the games have been played at Sports
Authority Field since 1998. Recommend discontinuing low productivity routes and
eliminating routes where duplicate service exists.
Low productivity routes are: Route RM24 - Alameda/Havana (alternative route 3, transfer
to C/E-Lines), Route RM38 - Federal Shuttle (alternative route 31), Route RM44 - Nine Mile
(alternative H-Line, transfer to C/E-Lines). And eliminating routes where duplicate service
exists, Route RM 12 – US36 & Sheridan, (alternative Flat Iron Flyer transfer to W/C/ELines). Route RM64 - Ward Road and Route RM8 - Olde Town Arvada (alternative G-Line,
transfer to W/C/E-Lines). Cost savings estimated to be $6,880.
Free MetroRide
Minor schedule adjustments, no cost impacts are anticipated.
Route JUMP
It is proposed to discontinue the ‘west-end loop’ between Broadway and 9th Street, due
to very low ridership and negative effect on on-time performance. Operations of this loop
currently result in additional resource requirements.
Changing to summer service levels for routes BOUND, DASH, JUMP, SKIP, and
STAMPEDE Other route related interline changes as result of a change to summer service
levels: (204, 225,206/206F, 208/208F and Y.
Due to ongoing labor negotiations there may be a need to make schedule adjustments not
currently listed in this proposal. Any subsequent changes necessary will be listed in the
Final Service Change Brochure prior to the implementation to be consistent with Board
policy on public notification.

Public Meeting Comments

Monday, February 26, 2018; 6pm
Alfalfa’s Community Room
1651 Broadway, Boulder Co
6:00 PM
Staff in attendance included Nataly Handlos, Tegan Rice and Diane Marquiss. There were 16 members
of the public including three City of Boulder Staff members and one representative from Boulder
Transportation Connections. No Board Members attended.
Anita O’Connor stated that the current Route Loop service was not very good, but was better than
nothing. She added that residents at the Presbyterian Manor are in need of the Route JUMP LOOP, due
to challenges in mobility otherwise. The bus is a connection, which allows them to independently
conduct their shopping and other day-to-day activities. Ms. O’Connor added that most of the residents
simply couldn’t afford the cost of VIA Access-a-Ride.
In addition, Ms. O’Connor mentioned that during snowy days access at bus stops can be a challenge,
since not all stops are cleared off snow properly.
Jean Day Alexander: suggested a HOP re-route to replace the proposed discontinued Route JUMP LOOP.
She suggested for the HOP to route westbound, from Downtown Boulder Station, via Canyon Blvd.,
Broadway, Arapahoe to 9th Street. She added that there are 89 residents at the Presbyterian Manor and
that a good number of them use the current route, on various days and times. Ms. Alexander stated that
a re-routed HOP would allow for the connection they need to have access to the rest of the City via RTD
transit. She also added that perhaps, as a compromise, only the ‘short-trips’ which start at Technical
Education Center (63rd/Arapahoe) would be the trips to operate through ‘the loop’ – or that at least one
trip per hour could operate the loop, so that they would not be left without service during the summer.
Natalie Stiffler (City of Boulder staff) informed those in attendance that with the HOP re-route design
underway, Route HOP is scheduled to start serving Arapahoe, between 9th St and Broadway, as of the
RTD August 2018 service changes. She added that the construction related to the 13th Street Underpass
at Arapahoe is scheduled to last throughout the summer, starting with the end of the BVSD school year
and ending with the start of move-in day at CU. Ms. Stiffler shared that the city has revised their
construction plans and now believes, that one lane in each direction will remain open at all times, along
Arapahoe, between 14th St and Broadway. She also quickly gave an overview of the HOP redesign
process.
Eve Booth agreed with Ms. O’Conor’s and Ms. Alexander’s statements and reiterated that the bus stop
at Arapahoe and 9th Street is needed for their mobility. She added that residents at Presbyterian Manor
do not have cars and that not only they, but also other shoppers at Alfalfa’s would benefit from the
JUMP route along Arapahoe, between Broadway and 9th St..
Jeana Chleborad asked if during the construction sidewalk access would be impeded.
Ms. Stiffler replied that the city will keep the sidewalk open at all times during the construction, at least
on one side of the street, in the vicinity of the construction area.

Margarita Welgado stated that she does not drive and that the bus is the only way she can get to King
Soopers and other places in Boulder. She reiterated that the Route JUMP is a connection for residents at
the Manor and that most cannot afford Access-A-Ride or VIA services. Ms. Welgado added that the bus
should not be a luxury, but rather that it is a necessity.
Marty Patton stated that she appreciated RTD re-instating the JUMP LOOP after the original
consideration of discontinuation with the previous August 2017 service changes. She added that for the
City of Boulder, environmental sustainability is a significant goal and that bus service contributes to this.
She agreed that the suggested HOP reroute is a good option and would like to see the route on the
south side of the street, so that residents of the Manor could more easily access it. Ms. Patton asked
that RTD staff look at all potential reroute options during the construction, in order to allow service to
remain during the summer. In addition, she added that Boulder is experiencing an increase in senior
population and that RTD and the City should partner more on providing additional, affordable mobility
options for seniors. Ms. Stiffler responded that the City might be able to consider subsidizing services
such as Lyft and Uber, or perhaps VIA, through ‘buy-up’ type assistance.
Dan Winahr stated that if Route JUMP were to be removed from the ‘the LOOP’ then the City of Boulder
Main Branch Library would probably be the only library in the Denver Metro area without transit access.
Joel Gilbert stated he lives at 5th and Arapahoe and manages a Neighborhood EcoPass program. He said
that as best as he sees the situation, it appears the real issue is the construction and thus no service
option for Route JUMP west of 14th St. and Arapahoe, for the summer only. Mr. Gilbert added that he
understands the mobility issue presented by the residents of Presbyterian Manor and that the issue is
not the ‘Loop’ routing, but rather that residents are left without transit connections for that time period.
He added that the City and RTD should look into potential alternatives for residents, including potential
rerouting of current routes or other service options.
Natalie Stiffler (Separate communication) requested that RTD remove the proposed elimination of the
JUMP “west end loop” from the recommended May 2018 service changes and grant more time before
we make this change to the JUMP route.

Staff in attendance included Nataly Handlos, Tegan Rice and Diane Marquiss. There were 4 members of
the public including one Broomfield Staff member. No Board Members attended.
Steve Johnson asked if when CDOT completes roadwork if the 128 would be re-routed again. Nataly
responded that once the roadwork is completed, Service Development would wait a minimum of 6
months to consider any changes to the routing.
Mr. Johnson was also concerned about the 112 only running on the weekends, and the new routing
would potentially eliminate access to mid-way on Saturdays. He was wondering if potentially the
demand was more for the 128 if RTD would switch routes for operation on Saturdays. Nataly said that is
a possibility depending on where the demand is for Saturdays and/or Sundays. RTD staff will monitor the
ridership and service requests.
Mr. Johnson also asked what the changes were for the C-line. Staff explained that it was just a matter of
minor trip time adjustments and that there were no changes to occur to the frequency or service span.
Carl Crosswhite asked if the potential fare rate changes, which are currently being discussed, would
increase ridership and what the impacts for the routes might be. Staff responded that with the routing
change proposed an increase in ridership is anticipated and that any increase of ridership can be
accommodated with the current service levels, because current ridership is low on all 3 routes.
Bob Davis asked if there are any changes to the Access-a-Ride schedule. Staff responded that there
were no changes for that service.

Staff in attendance included Jessie Carter, Doug Monroe, Brian Matthews, Jeff Dunning, Daniel Menter,
David Menter, Dan Merritt, Cesar Ochoa, Tegan Rice, and Cooper Langdon. No Board Members
attended.
Doug Monroe (RTD Service Planner/Scheduler, West Team Lead) started the meeting by introducing
himself and explaining the meeting’s purpose. He addressed several questions that those in attendance
had about proposed bus stop consolidations. He explained to all the basic rationale behind the
proposed stop consolidations: which are increased travel speed and increased schedule reliability for all
riders. He explained in certain instances bus stops were only a few hundred feet apart and/or used by
relatively few riders which had the effect of degrading service for many more on-board thru riders. He
also answered a question about the cost of closing bus stops.
Michael Thein said that commuter rail that currently operates only hourly should operate more
frequently instead at every 30 minutes. This would gain more riders. He said ‘Race for the Cure’ service

should remain and that low ridership last year was due to the weather. (Jessie Carter and Brian
Mathews explained that ‘Race for the Cure’ ridership over the last 6 years has been very low and well
below service standards).
Kevin Mooney said he used a wheelchair and that toilets at DUS and Downtown Boulder Station should
be able to be locked when in use. He said that the new Civic Center Station is very nice especially since
it included several well-located ADA door buttons. He also agreed with the proposed changes to routes
in the City of Broomfield. The commenter later said that he used a flashlight at light after dark to help
the driver see him waiting at his bus stop but that he still recently was passed-up at 95th & Arapahoe
after dark and had to wait for another hour. He also complained that elevators were recently out of
service at the US36 pedestrian bridge at Broomfield Station. (Doug Monroe explained that he could
phone customer care in these situations for assistance).
Helen Bushnell said the ‘Race for the Cure’ service should remain. She supported the changes proposed
in the City of Broomfield. She also said that she supported the route changes in the City of Broomfield.
She said in general that service change public hearings should have more explanation of the proposed
changes including slides. She said the proposed removal of so many bus stops was expensive for staff
and confusing to riders. She said that having extra bus stops near each other was a good backup if there
was nearby construction or snow at certain bus stops. Retaining bus stops was better for riders in
wheelchairs. She was also concerned about the proposed curtailment of a part of route #105, but later
withdrew that comment (Jessie Carter explained that only a small part of the route, south of Southmoor
Station, would actually see reductions).
Sharon Davis said that route #55L Eb trips, at 6:57a and 7:14a, often have standees which presents a
safety concern. She also said standees occur too often on the Wb trips at 4:10p and 4:25p. She
requested that larger buses be used. She also said that signs informing riders about bus stops being
eliminated should remain up longer after the stop is removed. (Doug Monroe explained that RTD sign
shop policy was to remove the notifications approximately 2 weeks after service has ended).
Leroy Robert said that route #43 and #12 buses that currently stop on street, near the 30th & Downing
Light Rail Station, should instead be routed to pull into the off-street bus area as they used to do several
years ago. This would promote better connections for riders, especially those using wheelchairs. (Jeff
Dunning explained that there few riders connected at 30th & Downing from the L-Line to route #43 as
#43 now already goes downtown obviating the need for that particular transfer). The commenter was
also concerned that route #12 buses block the traffic lane on Downing St. when serving riders at the
current on-street bus stop on Downing St adjacent to the Station. (Jessie Carter explained that the extra
time associated with pulling #43 and #12 buses into/out of the Station would require the cost of adding
an additional all-day bus into each of these routes to cover these routes’ schedules). The commenter
also said that route #28 should resume service east of Downtown on the weekends. Without that
service, he said he now must walk farther to MLK Blvd. to access route #43. (Jessie Carter explained that
route #28 service, east of Downtown, had been eliminated recently due to low ridership). The
commenter also said that L-Line frequencies should be increased in the evenings as service dropped
down to only every 30 minutes after 7.30p and is a very low level of service. The new L-Line now also
requires a transfer from 30th & Downing at all times to go farther south, and two transfers to go farther
south to Littleton on weekday evenings.
Michael Baily said that all of the proposed, and recent, bus stop closures are too many. In particular,
he said that recent closure of certain stops on route #20 near the hospital should be added back and

that the proposed reduction of certain trips should remain. He also said that the bus stop at 15th St &
Platte St. should be reinstated since there is nearby construction which prevents safe walking to the
next nearest bus stop. He said the City of Denver also does not plow the sidewalks of snow on 15th St on
the bridge over the Platte River. (Doug Monroe explained that the stop on 15th & Platte would be put
back along with the new adjacent development’s construction). The commenter also said that on route
#15 stops close to Downtown should remain since Colfax is such a well-used main bus street. On route
#10, the stops at Emerson and Ogden should remain and the proposed trip reduction should remain. On
route #12, the proposed frequency reduction south of Colfax should remain.
Dorothy Rice said that route #32 should operate more often on the weekends. This is because route
#28 no longer operates east of Downtown on the weekends. She also said that the new L-Line needs
more frequency and that it drops down to only every 30 minutes as early as 7.30p. She said that
previous D-Line trips could also be extended to 30th & Downing to increase service along Welton Ave.
She said that she lived near 20th Ave & Clarkson and that the area east of Downtown was now not
getting as much service as do areas served further to the east in Stapleton. She also commented that
the #16 bus stop at Colfax & Galapago should be retained, especially since it is not always safe to walk
farther alone along the street segment’s sidewalk.

Patrick Flanagan said that the Call-n-Ride in Broomfield was working well for him and appreciated the
service.

Lee Jacobson & Zach Bushay are opposed to the elimination of the Route 10- bus stop at 12th Avenue and
Pennsylvania Street stating that is a busy stop and 12th & Washington is not as busy. The also stated that
there are seniors in the building at this stop and discontinuing the bus stop would cause stress. There
were 2 people who voice their concern on this stop discontinuance.
Carol Streamer is supportive of the proposal to add trips on the Route 3L and would like to see a trip
added in the early afternoon. She also mentioned how difficult it was to travel from Windsor Gardens to
Boulder using the transit system
Ginger Montoya was concerned about her stop being eliminated on the Route 83L. (Her stop was not on

6:00 PM
Five members of the public were in attendance, along with Jessie Carter from RTD staff.
Lisa Lamunyon had questions about the seemingly variable routing of the Route 83D and the use of 8th
Avenue to get to Speer Boulevard. (Jessie Carter explained that the routing had recently been changed
and some operators may be using the old routing).
Sharon Williams noted that she and her husband selected Denver over Portland, Oregon for retirement,
based largely on the transit system. She applauded RTD for the growth of bus and rail systems.
Donald Scanlon opposes the changes proposed for the Route 169L. He and his wife both use the 169L to
access Denver International Airport and truly appreciate the ability to use their Senior discounted local
fare to do so. He has used the 169 to access the 40th Avenue & Airport Blvd Station to transfer to the
University of Colorado A Line and wondered if we would consider routing the 169L into this station,
allowing then to transfer for a local fare. (Jessie responded by say that they could use the 169 to transfer
to the 169L on-street to the same effect as his request.)
Sheila Scanlon asked if she could have more information on what would be the most cost effective fare
type to use to access DEN? (Jessie gave Mr. and Mrs. Scanlon his contact information for further
assistance on itineraries and fare information).
David Kelley stated that he was in opposition of the removal of the stop at 12th Ave – Pennsylvania
stating that he sees it as being very busy. He also stated that the eastbound 12th Avenue-Pennsylvania is
not as accessible to him, so he could see that stop being eliminated in favor of the stop at Washington
Street. (Jessie informed him that he was not alone in requesting the stop be maintained and that staff
was considering retaining the stop).

Please do not reduce rush hour frequency on the 12 line. It doesn't
make a lot of sense to reduce service with all of the new residents
moving in, especially at the Country Club towers, which are right on
the 12 line.
I am inclined to opposed the proposed midday frequency
reduction for Route 62. First, how long has this route been
in operation? I would think it should require at least a year
to allow potential passengers to become aware of and use
the route. Also, it's my understanding that this route is
funded by a CMAQ grant, and therefore cutting service
doesn't result in any financial savings to the District, as
the unused grant money must be returned to the federal
government.
I have just noticed the proposed change to Route 169L (to be
effective 20 May 2018) and offer the following comments. It is my
intention to attend the public meeting for Southeast Denver at
Calvary Baptist Church at 6:00 pm on Thursday, 1 March 2018.
PLEASE do NOT change the origin and termination point (opposite
Regis Jesuit HS on Lewiston St in Aurora) of the Route 169L bus.
While I acknowledge that few riders begin and end at that
terminus, my wife and I do regularly catch the Route 169L bus at
the Buckley Rd/Caley St stop as we make our way to DIA. The trip
takes just under an hour, is essentially a direct travel trip for us and
allows us to walk to/from the bus stop. Riding the 169 bus (rather
than the 169L bus) does offer more time opportunities but we then
must walk from the bus to the Light Rail Station at 40th/Airport,
and wait for the "A" train to get to DIA. Thank you. DL Scanlon
I would like to request that further adjustments be made to
accommodate late westbound A Line trains attempting to make a B
Line connection during evening rush hour at Union Station. The A
Line continues to run late and cause extended waits at Union
Station for cross-town commuters trying to catch the B Line headed
to Westminster Station with no other alternate routes to
Westminster Station.
I wanted to ask that when you are looking at minor schedule
adjustments for the 0 and late 15, please consider the arrival time
of inbound A line trains to Union Station from the airport. I work at
DIA and am off work usually in time for the 12:27am departure
from DIA, which arrives a few minutes after 1am at Union. Every
night I catch either the 0 or 15 from there up to Colfax/Broadway or
Colfax/Grant-Sherman, so I'm hoping the timing for that connection
will stay good with any minor changes that you feel may need to
happen. That late at night it's no fun waiting another 30 mins for
the next bus.
My name is Sarah and I work on the Amazon Ride team, specifically
with sites in the west, including Colorado. There is a relatively new
Amazon site in Aurora that has asked how to go about making a
request for improved transit service. Do you know who I may be
able to speak with at RTD to learn more about service change
requests?

Thanks for the great drivers and reliable 120x, 122x. service. I ride
RTD and from work almost every day. I love to ride the B line…but
the service is too infrequent for my work schedule. One must-do if
you cancel the Rockies Ride service… Increase the B Line service to
Westminster!!! We get the least rail service of any line in town,
and ridership is above what was predicted!
Please make it every 15 minutes during rush hour and at least 30
minutes other times. For Rockies fans, trying to catch the train
ONLY available on the hour is a horrible, unnecessary sacrifice,
definitely NOT FAIR, since riders on all other lines have many more
time options. We’re the last to get any rail or Fastracks anyway, at
least treat us like we matter as much as everybody else in town.
Good morning...I just want to say thank you for increasing the
tubes the C-line Runs; however it seems not smart to reduce the
cars to 2-cars especially at peak times. This morning starting at
mineral both cars were packed before we even left the station... By
Englewood it was ridiculous It would be nice to see three cars
during peak times Thank you for your consideration Margie

I've been a daily rider and EcoPass owner for over three years. I
immediately started using RTD light rail when I moved here
because, as a professional urban planner, I truly believe that good
public transit is one of the most impactful and useful services a city
can have. I love that Denver has rail transit. I have worked in other
cities promoting the re-introduction of rail transit, and I understand
both its cost and its capacity to spur development and make a
difference in the lives of people in the community. It has been very
exciting to see the RTD network expand so meaningfully over the
short time that I have lived here, and I look forward to the plans
that you have for the future. That said, I really don't understand
the service changes that you made for the C and D lines in January.
I read your blurb about both, and it still makes little sense. You had
reliable 15(ish) minute headways on the D line and similar service
during rush hour on the C line. Service was predictable and
intuitive, and it seemed to synchronize well with bus connections.
Honestly, service from south Denver/Englewood into central
downtown (where I would argue most people want to go) was
exactly what a commuter would dream of. Now you have what
feels like a jumbed mess between 8am and 10am: 10-15 minute
headways for the C line, half hour headways for the D line, except
at one point you go down to 10 minute headways, then all of the
sudden the rhythm shifts and you have pockets where no trains
come and people stand around for twenty to thirty minutes with no
trains. Then after rush hour (especially in the evenings) service
drops considerably, which has a pretty massive impact on the
service industry and student population (especially working
students who take night classes) that rely on the trains out of
downtown at night. It just feels like the ACTUAL level of service (not
the efficiency on paper) has dropped considerably from what it was
a month and a half ago. I know the process for service changes
usually involves a team of engineers analyzing ridership and cost
data and spitting out suggestions for the most efficient schedule.
What I also know is that these sorts of processes (and lets be real,
people - engineers aren't the most common-sense driven or
creative problem solvers) can leave out the notion that a good
public transit system is simple, reliable, and easy to navigate for the
daily commuter and visitor alike. In this case it just seems like you
guys have made the schedules way too convoluted and
complicated, and it shows in the number of riders just standing
around for extended periods of time, going back and forth reading
the schedules waiting for their next train. It's been over a month,
and it still seems like people are trying to figure out what's going
on, which I think is an indication that your schedule changes didn't
quite accomplish what you thought they would. It also seems like
your drivers are struggling, too. I get on northbound trains at the
Evans station, which isn't too far from the beginning of the line, yet

the trains are consistently several minutes late. You also talked
about how you made the trains longer, as in more cars per train.
Sometimes that's true, but in a handful of situations, D line trains
have only two cars. What this looks like is loads of freezing cold
people who have been stuck on a platform in the snow for half an
hour cramming into two standing room only train cars during rush
hour. I'm a young adult man, so I have no problem standing on the
train - in fact I just do it anyway even if there are open seats - but it
becomes a hazard when you have people with children and the
elderly/less physically able standing in the slippery wet aisles while
the drivers consistently take turns way too quickly and repeatedly
slam on their brakes or accellerate more aggressively than is really
necessary. Again, the numbers might say one thing, but common
sense and actually considering what would be best for your riders
would likely say another. For whatever it's worth, I hope that
someone actually sees this message for what it is: thoughtful
feedback from a transit rider who pays attention and has at least
half a clue as to what he's talking about. Admittedly I wrote in on
your comment form this morning (after standing around in the cold
for twenty minutes more than I planned and being late for work)
and was much more emotional and less thoughtful about my choice
of words. I apologize for that, and I hope that this longer, more
civil, and more constructive message makes up for what I would
describe as "bitching" in my previous comment submission.

Someone really thought that stopping D line service at 9:30 at the
Performing Arts Complex was a good idea? Have you guys ever
been out there when all the shows let out at once? And now you
expect all of us, including elderly theater patrons to squeeze on an
H line? WHAT WERE YOU THINKING!

My name is Amanda Brenner, and I'm 33 years old. I do
not own a car, and I rely on RTD for a lot of my
transportation needs. I like to think that I pay attention to
service changes and that I ride enough to be cognizant of
them. I was caught off guard last Friday, however. I
usually take the light rail to go downtown during the day,
but my wife and I had planned a night out downtown with
friends last Friday. We like to take RTD downtown on
weekend evenings so that we don't have to look for a
parking spot or pay for parking. I have been taking the
train from Englewood station long enough that I thought I
knew that we should catch the 7:12 D line to meet our
friends on time. But there was no 7:12 D line, and taking
the C line and transferring would have added 20+ minutes
to our trip. We ended up driving and paying for parking,
then I had to sneak out of the performance we were
attending so I could feed the meter when our time ran out.
I have so many problems with this experience. First of all,
if I didn't catch that service had changed, then it wasn't
advertised well. This is a problem. I don't think I should
have to look on the website or app to plan every single trip
I make with RTD. Secondly, the lack of night service on
the D line now is utterly appalling. Yes, in the best case
scenario, it will only add five minutes to your trip. Worst
case scenario, it could add 20-30 minutes. By limiting D
line service and inconveniencing people who were used to
this rather convenient line from the middle of downtown
to the south suburbs, I think this will encourage people to
drive more, especially on weekend nights when they might
be imbibing in controlled substances. I would really
appreciate some compensation for my experience on
Friday night. It was quite stressful to change plans on a
dime like we were forced to, and I am out a light rail pass
as I had validated a pass from a book of 10 local passes
before I learned that the train I wanted wasn't coming. If
RTD continues to make decisions contrary to the needs of
its customers in this manner, you will have lost a lifelong
rider, and I'm sure my friends and acquaintances on my
social media accounts would love to know about this as
well.
Friday night at 10:25 PM I took the H Line north bound from the
Theatre District/Convention Ctr Station to loop back around. There
were just a few passengers on the train. When the train left the
Theatre District/Convention Ctr Station it was jammed packed. My
suggestion, if you aren't going to extended the hours of the south
bound D Line, is that you add extra cars to the H Line to
accommodate theatre attendees, theatre employees and others
going south bound for an additional hour past the time the theatres
let out. This is especially going to be needed when Hamiliton plays
here in Denver.
I would like to complain about the services changes that were made
to the D line. The D trains are packed and the C trains are empty. I
hope this will be re-evaluated when changes are made in May.
why you cut service so much -- we can't even catch a D line after
930 PM or so, and the C Line is every half hour -- connection times
are distressing because it's often an almost half hour wait at
Broadway Station. I got off work last night and made it to the
station in time for the H train at 10:25 PM, which arrived at
Broadway Station at 1037, and had to wait for the C Line which
didn't arrive until 1107! That's really bad. Could something be
done so that a trip home which used to take around 25 minutes can
be restored somehow? It usually takes an hour to get home now.

Why did you change the D schedule so drastically? We have had
the D line to Littleton since July 14, 2000, that is nearly 18 years.
With absolutely no notification you totally disregarded getting to
and from Littleton and the Theater District and Convention Center
or downtown. It now takes an hour after 9:38 PM to get to
Littleton, because the there a 30 minutes wait at the Broadway
station for the next C train. There are three ways you could make it
better. Put on more D trains which would be the easiest for all the
riders south, both the Englewood station and the 2 Littleton
stations have a lot of riders. The other two suggestions is to change
both the H and C schedules so that the wait to transfer trains at
Broadway would be 5 to 7 minutes. Or have both H and C
scheduled every 15 minutes instead of 30 minutes. With 18 years of
dependable transportation by light rail taken away is a very sad
situation for all the people who depended on a great transportation
along the D line
Yesterday, we were waiting for more than 30 minutes we finally
took the H line. It took us one hour and half to get home out
Theatre District Convention Center Station. There is no new
schedule out Littleton Station or out of the Convention Station.
How are we suppose to get home. I would like my voice to be
heard.
e use the D line a lot between Evans Station and the
Convention Center/DCPA. All of a sudden, we don't have
a convenient and comfortable trip -- unless we leave the
symphony, which starts at 730 PM tonight -- before it's
over, to get back. The last D line is 929 PM, and trying to
connect with the C line, it's a half hour wait! This is a
complaint; I don't understand what RTD is doing, unless
you're trying to discourage people from using the rail.
I have been riding the D-Line from Evans Station to Theater District
Station. We have used this service allot in the past because it was
very convenient and reliable. With your service change, it is not
working well for people who use this because of all the cut times.
We now have to transfer and your connections do not work well.
For example, if I caught the first train after 11:00pm which is the HLine at 11:55pm and I transfer to the C-Line at Broadway it does not
connect. The connections are incredibly inconvenient.
I am reaching out to share that the recent schedule changes are
adversely affecting my light rail commute to/from Denver Center
for the Performing Arts (DCPA) via the Convention Center station.
For example, the last D Line departure at 9:38pm Friday is not late
enough for some shows. Could RTD please consider adding at least
one more D Line departure after 10:00pm on Fridays and Saturdays
to accommodate DCPA patrons?
Your changes to the D Line is not very good for those who
go to the theatre district. There is still so many things
going on in this area that the last train south bound is not
late enough. You have made it very inconvenient to travel
back down to Littleton.
We need more FF4s in the morning. Right now, the 7:17 and 7:24
end up being standing room only by Broomfield or completely full.
We need another option! There are 5 routes that go to Union
Station, but only one that goes to Civic Center Station! That is
ridiculous. We need more options! I would like to know when you
will be adding more buses or fixing this problem. RTD needs to
improve customer satisfaction!
Good morning. I am riding on this mornings 7:30 FF7. I am
one of 11 people standing due to the size of the bus. I feel
like the FF7 should always have a large bus. There are
consistently people standing during certain times... thanks

Thanks for the great service you provide! I just wanted to
encourage you to not change the JUMP route west of 14th st. I rely
on the JUMP to get to work at 1101 Arapahoe. Getting off at 14th
isn’t a huge nuisance for me, but I would prefer the bus to stay on
the same route.
It appears that the L line serves no real purpose besides delaying
the arrival of other trains. The L train rarely has more than a few
riders, but its arrival at the Stout station delays the arrival of the H
Line by several minutes and seems to throw a wrench in the rest of
the trip. After leaving late due the the L Line, the H Line made
several other mid point stops for no apparent reason and was
delayed arriving at 9 Mile. Please get rid of the L Line.
Shock yet another accident downtown which delays all those trains
so if you decrease the r line, aurora residents which rtd doesnt care
about to begin with that work downtown would be even more
delayed having to transfer and wait for later trains without the R
line. It would also delay you're oh so precious airport riders, the
only riders you care about. It's not enough you've ruined the r line
schedule with you're adjustments to accommodate a line people,
now r line riders that have to make transfers to other rtd crap
services up to if not longer than 30 minutes which as today in the
negative degree weather is just great. But as you never listen to
riders nor reply to emails I know this like all other communication
will go ignored.
The January 2018 schedule changes have had significantly negative
impacts on transportation service. Southbound rail services out of
the downtown loop are overwhelmed with riders. Sometimes riders
are unable to board a train because it is so crowded, with people
completely filling the isles and stairwells, many without access to a
secure handhold while riding, resulting in minor injuries when an
operator makes a hard stop. With the reduction in service intervals
on rails out of downtown, people are forced to stand in the harsh
cold waiting for a train, crowding the sidewalks, attracting the
homeless community, and many time not being able to board the
next train due to overcrowding. Elderly are unable to sit and
wheelchairs are completely unable to board. Public transportation
is many people's only commuting option, and these recent changes
are doing them and every other contributing tax payer a massive
disservice. The current operation is unsafe, ineffective, and
generally unacceptable and must not be allowed to continue. I have
photos of the current riding conditions that I can provide upon
request.
I have appreciated using RTD when I have needed it. I commute
from Longmont to the Denver VA Hospital. Due to the 2.5 hour, and
bus change/wait, I only take the bus when I really need to. I am
anticipating the move to the new facility in Aurora later this year.
My commute will lengthen to 42 miles each way. Is there any way
that a new route could be established? A direct route from
Interstate 25 and Highway 119 to the Aurora Medical complex, that
includes the VA hospital, Childrens Hospital and University? I
would really like to ride a direct bus from Longmont. There are a
number of professionals that make the commute. I do work 10
hour shifts with very rigid start and finish times.

Since most likely I will not be able to attend any of the announced/
scheduled 'in-person' public meetings (to discuss the various
changes to bus routes/ schedules/ stops, etc...), I am writing here
to include my comment (as the "Proposed May 2018 Service
Changes" information flyer indicates that we may comment via
email -- and "no later than March 2, 2018"). Specifically, I wish to
discuss the proposed closure/ elimination of the following bus
stops:
Eastbound at 12th Ave. and Pennsylvania St. (Stop #10177)
Westbound at 12th Ave. and Pennsylvania St. (Stop #10178)
I happen to live very close to those particular stops -- and regularly
use them to ride the #10 bus. Additionally, I often do see quite a
few other local residents/ individuals utilize them, as well (during
the morning rush hour, as well as at various times throughout the
day)... Therefore, I feel that such a change would prove to be an
inconvenience to those "regular" riders (whose ride/s "begin" and
"end" at those stops). However, if it is ultimately determined that
these bus stops will indeed be "shut down" in May of 2018 (even
though they have been/ remained there for so many years),
hopefully I (as well as my fellow riders) will be able to board the
#10 bus from the remaining nearby locations (namely, Eastbound at
12th Ave. and Washington St. -- and Westbound at 12th Ave. and
Grant St.) -- and that those stops will remain 'intact'... I thank you
in advance for your time, attention, and consideration regarding
this matter.

I have recently learned that RTD is proposing removal of 4 stops on
the 11 route in the Athmar Park neighborhood where I reside.
These stops at Exposition Ave. & S. Zuni St. and Exposition Ave. and
S. Federal Blvd serve a great deal of my community and enhance
the mobility of our residents, particular the elderly and disabled
where an additional 2 blocks of walking or wheel-chair rolling can
have a severe impact on their ability to arrive on-time or at all.
These stops are also on primary intersections of the neighborhood
where the majority of traffic, vehicular and pedestrian, are utilizing
the area. These stops are sensible and well-placed. Their removal
creates a gap in the transit network of our neighborhood. It is also
that when someone is not present at the stop or a passenger is not
requesting a stop at one of them, they are then "on-demand", only
used as needed. It seems insensible to remove them, when they
currently serve their function only when needed. It is already very
efficient in that manner and their removal only burdens your
customers, and my community. Please reconsider their removal
and continue to serve our neighborhood with the interest of our
residents.
I ride the #10 west bound from stop #21039 at 12th and Ogden. I
do not agree with your proposal of eliminating this stop. It is
heavily used, and would be and inconvenience.
Discontinuing the Pennsylvania stops on route #10 will
cause a hardship for me. I use the bus frequently and have
a chronic disease making walking an extra 2 blocks
difficult.
Colfax & Reed west bound is a late night wheel chair handicap stop

My comment concerns the southbound re-routing from
Downing Street and 18th Ave to 19th Ave and Ogden St.
First, I'd like to remind staff and the RTD Board that the
current southbound Route 12 makes a stop on Downing St
just north of 18th Ave, which allows passengers to
transfer to Route 20 westbound. With the proposed
rerouting, this stop would presumably be discontinued.
The next Route 12 stop is on Ogden St north of 17th Ave,
closer to Route 20 eastbound. I would support this
rerouting if provision were made to provide a bus stop on
Ogden St, probably north of 18th Ave and Park Ave, that
would continue to allow a convenient transfer to Route 20
westbound. A new stop on 19th Ave near Ogden Street
would be less preferred.
I take this bus Monday - Friday to get to work. I have to
transfer to the #76 north bound. As you know
Wadsworth Blvd & West Colfax is an EXTREMELY BUSY
intersection. If you are trying to get the connection from
#16 westbound to #76 northbound and you eliminate the
West Colfax / Wadsworth Blvd nearside stop it can take
up to 5 minutes to LEGALLY & SAFELY get across
Wadsworth Blvd if you see the #76 northbound bus
coming. This will force RTD bus patrons to either RISK
THEIR LIFE AND ILLEGALLY RUN ACROSS WADSWORTH
AGAINST THE TRAFFIC SIGNAL IN ORDER TO GET THE
#76 northbound bus to get to work OR MISS THE BUS
AND HAVE TO WAIT ANOTHER 30 MINUTES FOR THE
NEXT #76 northbound bus and get to work late every day
and risk losing their job.
hank you,
Richard a very concerned OLDER PERSON who only wants
to get to work SAFELY each day and not have to risk my
life to get the RTD bus connection to get to work.
I live along the 10 route. I am very discouraged to see the proposed
elimination of so many stops. The one thing that is nice about the
current route is that it has always been convenient and not like an
Limited or Express route. Specifically, I am impacted by the
elimination of the stops at 12th and Pennsylvania. These stops
serve a high-density population, as well as two nearby Bed and
Breakfast businesses, not to mention the Molly Brown house one
block to the north. I am also concerned about the elimination of
the stops at 12th and Ogden/Emerson. The eastbound stop is the
most convenient stop to walk to transfer to the southbound 12.
Otherwise, one has to exit at the Corona stop and cross Corona to
go back to the 12 stop, increasing the danger of riders running
across a busy one-way street to make a close connection. Overall, I
hate to see RTD make changes that discourage ridership,
particularly in the Capitol Hill neighborhood where there is a highdensity population, including elderly and physically-compromised
riders and school children. For these riders, to have to walk another
two or three blocks may make an RTD trip impractical. (Also, I have
always thought that an additional stops between Corona and
Humboldt Streets would be helpful). Perhaps RTD would consider
adding a rush-hour Limited route with fewer stops to streamline
the trip for commuters, but leave the local 10 in tact.

I believe RTD is proposing to remove several stops in the Athmar
Park neighborhood. I ride the 11 often, coming home from work.
The stops that are targeted for removal are not my stops, but I
don’t see why you need to eliminate them. I mean, if no one wants
to be picked up or dropped off, then it doesn't slow the bus down
at all, since it doesn't stop. If someone does need to
embark/disembark, well, then, the stop is ipso facto useful, and a
stop adds only like 30 seconds to the route time (compared to the
amount of time it would take someone to walk the extra blocks to a
still-viable stop). Are you guys trying to save maintenance costs of
the extra stops? Because I don’t know the potentially-removed
stops so well, but I know that at my own stop (Shoshone and
Exposition), there isn’t much—if any—maintenance done. I would
really like to hear the reasons for removing an on-demand bus stop.
Especially since presumably, you guys did some research at one
point and decided that it was a good place for a bus stop. What has
changed? Denver has enough problems with mass transit. The 14,
which I usually take in to work, only runs every half hour. We
should be expanding routes and stops to make it easier to catch a
bus, not harder! I hope you will reconsider making bus travel even
more difficult (and dangerous, in the winter! Have you seen
Athmar’s sidewalks?!).
I am confused on the stops you want to eliminate on
Route 6. Your system map online shows the 6 has an
eastbound stop at Vine St., not Gaylord St. Do you mean
you want to eliminate the eastbound stop at Vine St.? Or
is the stop now at Gaylord St. and your system map is
wrong? Either way, eliminating whichever stop is there
now along with the York stop (which probably is a waste,
as I know the 15 never stopped both at York and
Josephine) will leave the public with no stop for 6 blocks.
That is way too long to maneuver when your a senior with
bags your carrying down the not so great side walk. With
the numbet of older homes and older riders in this area, I
would like to see you keep a stop every 3 blocks. For the
same reason, if you eliminate the eastbound stop at
Dexter, you leave 5 blocks without a stop from Clermont
to Elm St, which is too far to walk for me. Also,
eliminating the eastbound and westbound Empire stops
leaves no stop for 5 blocks between Dayton and Fulton. I
can live without the eastbound and westbound stops at
Abilene and Bayaud as long as the 6 still stops just after
taking the left turn on Alameda past TGIFridays going
eastbound and the Alameda and Sable stop going
westbound. Again eliminating the westbound Lowry Blvd
and Spruce stop leaves 5 blocks with no stop from
Rampart to Rosemary. Also, eliminating the westbound
Vine stop leaves 5 blocks with no stop between Josephine
and High. Thank You for considering my concerns on
Route 6 changes.

I feel you should keep stops that when removed leave 5 or more
blocks without a stop. Us seniors have a hard enough time walking
on uneven sidewalks carrying our purchases without making the
walk even longer. Therefore, I don't want you to eliminate the
eastbound and westbound stops at Mississippi and Milwaukee Way
as that leaves no stop between Elizabeth and Steele. I wouldn't
want you to eliminate the westbound stop at Mississippi Ave. and
Garfield St. as that would leave 5 blocks without a stop between
Colorado Blvd and Madison St. I am OK with you eliminating the
eastbound stop of the same. I believe it is too far to walk if you
eliminate both the eastbound and westbound stops at S. Kearney
St. and Tennessee Ave. and the stop at Mississippi Ave. and
Kearney St. I believe you should only eliminate one of those stops
and keep one of the 2 stops. If you eliminate the eastbound stop at
Mississippi Ave. and Kingston St., you leave 5 blocks from Joliet to
Moline without a stop, which is too far for me to walk. Also, the
sidewalk ends at Kingston, I believe, which would make it even
more difficult. The westbound stop at Mississippi Ave. and Lansing
St. should not be eliminated as that would leave 5-6 blocks without
a stop between Moline St. and Kenton Way. On an extra note, my
mom's house is right on Florida Ave. However, there are no buses
on Florida Ave. So I have to walk 5 more blocks south after I get off
of 11 on Mississippi Ave. just to get to Florida on top of you trying
to eliminate the closest Mississippi stop there is. Also, I can not see
you eliminating both westbound stops at W. Mississippi Ave. and S.
Teller St. and the W. Mississippi Ave. and S. Vance St. That would
leave 5 blocks from S. Reed St. to Wadsworth Blvd without a stop. I
would like to see you keep one of these stops either at Teller or
Vance.
I use RTD transit to travel to work, and I noticed a proposal to
eliminate a few of the stops I frequently use. The stop at 14th and
Irving is how I'm able to get to the library and is used by a lot of
other riders. Also Colfax and Perry is a stop I like because it is at a
stop light with a cross signal, so getting across Colfax is less
treacherous. Colfax and Quitman is right next to it and is only used
now as a substitute for Perry because of construction. Please do
not get rid of these stops as I use them almost every day. Thank
you.
A bus stop at Mississippi & Teller St is set to be closed as
part of the May 2018 changes. This would be a great
inconvenience for me and I can only imagine others as
well. That stop is the closest stop to the elementary
school there (Emory Elementary). Why not close the stop
at Mississippi & Reed St since it is so close to the stop at
Pierce? The Teller stop is a better middle point between
the Pierce stop and the Wadsworth stop.
I would really appreciate it if you guys didn't get rid of the Quebec
Way and Florida Ave Nearside stop in May. My mother uses a
walker and it would make it very hard for her to walk further to the
next stop.
Evans and Lafayette - Why would you get rid of this stop?
It doesn't make sense as to why you guys would eliminate
the only stop that is right in front of this elementary
school. Now these kids have to walk three blocks for the
next stop! This is a safety risk to these kids! It's also right
in front of a grocery store, you're telling me that I have to
walk three blocks with my grocery bags? What about the
disabled? I am blind and now I have to walk further to get
to the next stop and to drop off my kids at the stop. This
is not okay. Please reconsider it, and keep this stop.
12th & Pennsylvania - I would like to file a complaint
about you guys trying to take away this stop. This is a VA
route. This would make it a really long walk from Grant to
Washington, to get to the next stop. This is my complaint
please do not take these stops away, we need them.

Please don't close this stop.
It's literally right outside my office front door and it has a
bench.
If I had to walk two blocks after a long work day, then not
being able to catch the 505pm... Watching that 505pm
number 6 fly by as I waddled as fast as a can, would
suck..
I wouldn't connect with the 607pm number 8 downtown
and that would mean my disabled backside would have to
stand around downtown for and additional hour and
twelve minutes waiting for the next 8.
Please don't close #25231
I would like you all to consider leaving the stop at
Louisiana Ave and Pearl St (next to 7-11). I am a frequent
rider and am also blind. I would find it more difficult and
unsafe to cross and board over at the actual station,
should this stop be removed.
In my experience 3 times as many riders get on and off at
Lipan and 38th going westbound than they do at that dark
spot at Kalamath and 38th. I would rather see you
eliminate Kalamath stop and keep the well lit Lipan stop in
front of the 7-Eleven. Also, the Benton and 38th stop has
the shelter and is closest to the King Soopers for all of us
who are handicapped and need easy access to the grocery
store with our walkers and carts. I believe you should keep
the Benton stop in both directions for us shoppers. The
22nd and Blake stop is used when the Rockies have a
home game a lot. By employees of Coors Field and the
fans. I propose that you keep stopping there when there is
home games at Coors Field. There must be some way you
can accommodate the people attending the games when a
portion of the sales tax that is collected on sales at Coors
Field goes to RTD.
I just wanted to reach out. I'm actually super for the effort
to reduce stops I think this is exactly what is needed to
improve the system. I might make one change
recommendation on the 10. Its not my personal stop but I
notice significantly more people board the westbound 10
at 12th and Pennsylvania than I do at the 12th and
Washington stop. It might make more sense to close the
Washington stop than the Pennsylvania stop.

According to RTD service standards, the desired stop spacing for
local routes is one-quarter mile. I would encourage you to apply
this standard flexibly, considering such factors as intersecting
routes, intersection geometrics, intersection signal programming,
surrounding development and route spacing. You might also wish
to use a moving average technique to identify sections where stops
are spaced too closely. Some Board members have expressed
frustration about "buses stopping every two blocks." I would like to
remind them (and you) that for some sections of numbered
avenues - such as from 80th Avenue to 88th Avenue - avenues are
spaced eight to a mile. For such locations, every two blocks is
precisely the desired spacing. In contrast, there are 16 named
streets between Washington Street (700 East) and York Street
(2300 East). In this case, the desired spacing is every four blocks.
Thank you for being responsive to public requests to maintain more
closely spaced stops to serve individuals with mobility limitations.
Some larger intersections - such as Colorado and Alameda, or
Wadsworth and Belleview - might be around 150 to 200 feet to
cross. Also keep in mind that traffic signal cycles at such
intersections may be as long as 150 seconds - 2.5 minutes.
Depending on stop placement and bus arrival time, there might be
a 5 minute difference in the time required to transfer at such
intersections, if a rider has to first wait for the bus to get the green
light, and then cross from a far side stop. I would encourage
retaining both near-side and far-side stops at such locations - and
even on routes serving minor streets that cross such wide arterials,
for example, the Route 34 on Bruce Randolph Avenue crossing
Colorado Blvd. Finally, keep in mind that some north-south routes
are spaced as much as a mile and a half apart. This occurs between
Route 76 (Wadsworth) and Route 52 (Sheridan), Route 52 and
Route 31 (Federal), Route 24 (University/York) and Route 40
(Colorado), and Route 73 (Quebec) and Route 105 (Havana). People
wishing to access such routes may be already walking 3/4 to a full
mile before reaching the major north-south arterial. Since research
shows that bus ridership drops dramatically once passengers have
to walk more than a quarter mile to reach a stop, it would be
advantageous not to require such passengers to walk great
distances on the north-south arterials.
I oppose eliminating the stops (each direction) at 8550 Lowry Blvd.
These stops serve the Big Bear ice arena, and were the stops I used
when I played in a recreational hockey league there. While these
stops are about 0.2 miles from the stops at the Unita Way
roundabout, eliminating them would create a distance of about
0.45 to 0.5 miles to the next set of stops at the Yosemite
roundabout. If you're not familiar, I'd like to remind you that a
hockey bag can be about the size of checked airport luggage. A
goalie's bag can be even larger. These are bulky items, and benefit
from more convenient access to the ice rink. and while league
games are typically scheduled only once a week, I'd also like to
remind you that if no passenger requests a stop, then there is no
delay to the bus. Also, as your own Trailblazer cites, "Our
Passengers are not an interruption of our work, they are the
purpose of it."
You need to keep the Route 10 bus stops at • 12th Ave. and
Pennsylvania St
because it is front of a 20 story high rise building (Penn Square)
with many residents who use the bus, and several of us who are
disabled. I use a wheelchair and others use walkers. We will not be
able to get to the nearest remaining bus stop if this change is made.

I'm sending thus email requesting that the above mentioned bus
stops to not be discontinued. There are many individuals who live
at Penn Square and surrounding neighborhood who use these bus
stops. Included among those users are several disabled and elderly
persons. Another fact that may not have been considered is that
the East bound stop at Washington St which is being kept is at the
bottom of a hill. In the winter on many occasions a bus becomes
stuck there due to having to start from a stopped position at the
base of the hill.
Please keep the stop at 550 E 12th ave................many residents of
this high rise use this stop. THANK YOU,
I am a resident in Penn Square, a 20-story high rise on the corner of
12th and Pennsylvania. I am writing to protest the elimination of
the bus stop in front of this building (east bound) as well as the one
on the northwest corner (west bound). There are a number of
handicapped and elderly residents in this building who use RTD –
it’s the only transportation they have. This change will be very
detrimental to them. Please take into consideration this concern.

Attachment: Memo-Service Availability- February 2018 (3429 : Service Availability Update 3 13 18)

1.C.1.a

RTD fixed-route bus operations provided slightly over 99.1% of all scheduled hours of
bus service in February 2018. Lost service hours for personnel related reasons
did increase from 297.65 hours in February of 2017 to 996.09 hours for the month of
February 2018 and from 568.41 hours YTD in February 2017 to 1660.13 for the YTD in
2018.
While RTD did provide in excess of 99.1% of all scheduled hours of service in the
month, it was necessary to cover 2590 shifts by operators working a 6th day (one of
their schedule days off). This represents approximately 20,700 hours of service being
provided by a “6th day” RTD operator and does not include the mandated service hours
provided by our contractor partners, First Transit and TransDev. Contributing to our
service challenges in February were several bus bridges and several snow days. Staff
continues to work with Human Resources and other departments to address ways to
improve recruitment and retention among bus operators.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

From:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

Board Meeting Date: March 13, 2018

Subject:

Contracted Fixed-Route Quarterly Report – 4th
Quarter 2017

Information

The following is a discussion of the performance measures for the fourth quarter of 2017 for the fixedroute services provided by private contractors:


PREVENTABLE VEHICLE ACCIDENTS PER 100,000 MILES
The contractors, individually and as a group, met the target of ≤ 2.0 Preventable Vehicle
Accidents per 100,000 miles in the 4th quarter. First Transit and Transdev continue to utilize
bus operator monitoring technology and post-accident investigations for retraining of operators.
The contractors continue to emphasize safety with all employees at monthly safety meetings,
through periodic campaigns, and with daily reminders at their facilities.



PASSENGER ACCIDENT RATIO PER 100,000 MILES
The contractors, as a group, met the target of ≤ 0.18 Passenger Accidents per 100,000 miles in
the 4th quarter. First Transit Denver did not meet the goal with 0.19 Passenger Accidents per
100,000 miles. All of the passenger accidents that occurred through the 4th quarter were
classified non-preventable. First Transit and Transdev continue to raise awareness of passenger
safety through campaigns and safety meetings to reduce the number of passenger accidents per
100,000 miles.



ON-TIME PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE INSPECTIONS
The contractors, individually and as a group, met the target of 98% of Preventive Maintenance
Inspections completed as scheduled in the 4th quarter. RTD and the contractor organizations
place a high emphasis on completing preventive maintenance inspections as required, and as
such, the local operations are diligent about completing these inspections on time.



ON-TIME PERFORMANCE
Transdev and First Transit Longmont met the target of 88% Local On-Time Service with 88.2%
and 88.2% on-time performance in the 4th quarter. First Transit Denver (87.5%) and First
Transit Commerce City (83.3%) did not meet the goal due in part to the high number of new
operators, unexpected detours, and traffic. RTD and the private contractors continue to
campaign routes and operators with low on time performance with a strong focus on first time
point departures. On a monthly basis contractors review the OTP report and meet with operators
of low performing routes to discuss factors that are impacting their ability to reach 88% on time
performance. Running time issues are forwarded to RTD Service Planning and Scheduling for
review.
The contractors will continue to address on-time performance issues with operators, but always
tie safety to the discussion. It’s better to be a few minutes late than to have an accident.

1.C.2



MILES BETWEEN LOST SERVICE ROAD CALLS
The contractors, individually and as a group, exceeded the target of 30,000 Miles Between Lost
Service Maintenance Road Calls in the 4th quarter. The contractors continue to address this area
by completing preventive maintenance inspections on time, working off defects in a timely
manner, monitoring repeat issues, providing additional training for mechanics, and taking a proactive approach to maintaining the buses in their fleets.



OPERATOR COMPLAINTS PER BOARDING
4th quarter 2017 ridership was not available by Division at the time this report was prepared and
as a result Complaints per Boarding have not been calculated for the Contractor divisions. The
contractors did receive 956 less complaints year to date through the 4th quarter 2017 when
compared to the same time period in 2016. The contractors continue to utilize onboard video
surveillance as a coaching tool to assist operators in improving customer interactions. In
addition, the steps noted above regarding on-time performance have helped address some
customer complaints. The contractors also continue to address complaint trends with all
operators at monthly safety meetings.
The contractors continue to take a variety of actions over and above contract requirements to
address their operator hiring/retention challenges which include hiring bonuses, wage increases,
incentives to take on additional work, employing a full-time recruiter, and mentoring programs.

2017 4th
Analysis

Quarter

Customer

Complaint

Recapped below is an analysis of the customer complaint trends for the 4th Quarter of 2017.
included is a comparison of customer complaint data for the same period in 2016.

Also

As noted in previous reports, in 2007 and 2008, RTD and the private contractors were meeting the
performance goal for customer complaints of .0002 complaints per passenger boarding. In 2009, RTD
began stricter enforcement of the fare policy and the priority seating area policy which advised
passengers with strollers or other large items that they would need to move from the priority seating
area if those seats were needed for disabled passengers. In addition, RTD posted notices on all buses
and light rail vehicles advising passengers of the requirement under Title VI of the Civil Rights Law for
operators to call out transfer points. Following the implementation of these policies/procedures,
customer complaints increased, but for 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 RTD and the private contractors
performed, for the most part, at a level of .0003 to .0004 complaints per passenger boarding. In 2012,
the performance goal for passenger complaints was adjusted to .0003 complaints per passenger
boarding. The goal for 2014 was again adjusted to account for the static higher level of complaints due
to the securement area/priority seating issues, the fare enforcement campaigns, TIC availability,
introduction of SmartCards, and the new West Line service. The goal for 2015 and 2016 remained at
.0004 complaints per passenger boarding. The 2017 goal was again set at .0004 complaints per
passenger boarding.
Ridership data for the 4th Quarter of 2017 was only available as a total for RTD and the private
contractors combined. Consequently, the Complaints per Passenger Boarding per operating division
could not be calculated. The Complaints per Passenger Boarding for the District as a whole (local bus
operations) for the 4th Quarter of 2017 was .0004. The Complaints per Passenger Boarding for the
same period in 2016 was also .0004.
RTD staff, as well as the private contractors, monitor and address customer complaints on a daily basis.
RTD and the private contractors investigate all customer complaints using a variety of tools, including
CAD/AVL “flashbacks” and video review and address/discipline operators as needed. Many times the
results of the investigation reveal that the complaint is not valid. Some of the reasons for the “Not
Valid” classification include the following:
Bus was on time (between 1 min early to 5 min late) per “flashback”
Operator followed proper procedure
Passenger presented insufficient fare
Passenger had no proof of eligibility for a discounted fare
Passenger presented an expired transfer
Passenger presented a counterfeit pass
Buses were running late District-wide due to weather
There was no video evidence to support the complaint

Packet Pg. 67

1.C.6

RTD and the private contractors continue to work collectively in a variety of different areas to address
customer complaints.
 Bus routes with poor on-time performance are monitored by both RTD and private contractor
personnel to determine if the problem is related to the operator or the running time of the route.
 Meetings are held on a monthly basis with contractor and RTD personnel to discuss challenges,
solutions and best practices in the areas of bus maintenance, operations, safety and training.
 RTD conducts refresher training for all operators on an annual basis, and a component of the
training is customer service. The private contractors conduct mandatory monthly safety meetings
wherein they discuss customer service issues and provide suggestions for improving passenger
interactions.
 RTD and private contractor trainers spend time at Civic Center Station (and the alternate
boarding/deboarding locations during CCS construction) and Denver Union Station the first week
of each runboard to provide assistance to operators who may need some refreshers on station
procedures or have questions on their routes.
 RTD has also reached out to the disability community (Colorado Cross Disability Coalition,
Colorado School of the Blind, Atlantis, DRMAC Transit Accessibility Task Force) to get feedback
on ways to improve RTD service for passengers with disabilities.
 Operators are recognized for the good customer service they provide.
Divisions post
commendations on a bulletin board in the drivers’ room and some provide additional means of
recognition.
Historically, and in 2017, the following complaint categories generated the highest number of customer
complaints:
Bus Did Not Show
Bus Early
Bus Late
Careless Driving/Operator
Discourtesy/Operator
Improper Procedure by Operator
Passed Up Passenger at Stop
All of these complaint categories are what RTD considers “operator related” and are included in the
complaint numbers that are tracked and reported to the Board of Directors on the Quarterly Performance
Report.
The high complaint categories are routinely reviewed to determine the factors, both internal and
external, that are impacting the number of complaints. The input received from both RTD and private
contractor operations is noted below:
Bus Did Not Show – 4th Quarter 2017: the complaints in this category increased 5.84% compared to
the same period in 2016. RTD and the private contractors continue to struggle with operator shortages
and the resulting impact on service delivery. RTD and the private contractors are maintaining their focus
on reducing operator vacancies, ensuring timely pull-outs and providing service per published schedules.
The YTD average in this category for 2017 is 7.49 complaints per day. The comparable number for
2016 was 7.06 complaints per day.
Bus Early – 4th Quarter 2017: complaints in this category decreased 8.68% compared to the same
period in 2016. “Flashbacks” for “bus early” complaints often show buses running late. It is possible
passengers see the prior bus running late and will assume it is their bus running early. Operators are
addressed whenever the CAD/AVL playback confirms that the bus was running ahead of schedule. The

Packet Pg. 68

1.C.6

YTD average in this category for 2017 is 4.67 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2016
was 5.10 complaints per day.
Bus Late – 4th Quarter 2017: complaints in this category decreased 22.05% compared to the same
period in 2016. This category has also been impacted by the operator shortages. However, occasional
improvements to staffing have resulted in periodic improvements in this category. Improving on-time
performance continues to be a challenge for a variety of reasons including construction, traffic and
heavy ridership delays; service reductions, which result in the same number of passengers on fewer
trips; and the inability to fund service improvements to address running-time issues. The YTD average in
this category for 2017 is 8.24 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2016 was 10.54
complaints per day.
Careless Driving/Operator – 4th Quarter 2017: complaints in this category decreased 8.33% compared
to the same period in 2016. On a regular basis, video recordings are reviewed and undercover ride
checks are performed to determine if operators are driving in an unsafe or inappropriate manner. In
addition, RTD and the private contractors have “G-force activated” event-recording systems (Drive Cam,
Smart Drive) installed on the buses. These incidents are also reviewed on a daily basis. Operators
continue to be counseled and retrained as needed to improve driving performance. Also, periodic safety
campaigns are conducted to reinforce safe driving habits. The YTD average in this category for 2017 is
3.74 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2016 was 4.07 complaints per day.
Discourtesy/Operator – 4th Quarter 2017: complaints in this category decreased 25.78% compared to
the same period in 2016. In the majority of cases, video evidence confirms that the operator followed
proper procedures and treated the customer with respect. In many cases, operators are shown
enforcing or explaining policies (requesting proper fare payment, requesting space in the priority seating
area, addressing inappropriate behavior) in a polite and respectful manner and the passengers react in a
negative manner. Operators are counseled and disciplined if video evidence confirms that they treated
passengers in a discourteous or inappropriate manner. Operators are also given suggestions for handling
similar situations in the future. The YTD average in this category for 2017 is 7.67 complaints per day.
The comparable number for 2016 was 10.31 complaints per day.
Discrimination – 4th Quarter 2017: complaints in this category increased 8.79% compared to the same
period in 2016 (from 91 complaints to 99 complaints). Investigation into discrimination-related
complaints usually shows the operator not at fault. The YTD average in this category for 2017 is 0.27
complaints per day. The comparable number for 2016 was 0.25 complaints per day.
Fare Dispute – 4th Quarter 2017: complaints in this category decreased 6.93% compared to the same
period in 2016. The implementation of the new fares and fare equipment presented challenges for some
customers. Investigations into “fare dispute” complaints often show that passengers presented an
improper/incomplete fare and are not happy with the operators’ enforcement of the fare policies. The
YTD average in this category for 2017 is 1.18 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2016
was 1.26 complaints per day.
Improper Procedure/Operator – 4th Quarter 2017: complaints in this category decreased 21.19%
compared to the same period in 2016. RTD and private contractor training and operations personnel
meet on a regular basis to ensure all operators are receiving consistent and up-to-date information. In
addition, the on-going refresher training provided to RTD operators and the monthly safety meetings held
at the private contractor divisions provide operators with information about accommodating the needs of
RTD passengers to the best of their abilities. In cases where video evidence shows operators are not

following proper procedures, appropriate coaching activities are taken. The YTD average in this category
for 2017 is 6.45 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2016 was 8.16 complaints per day.
Incorrect Info/Operator – 4th Quarter 2017: complaints in this category decreased 33.85% compared to
the same period in 2016. The combined efforts of the General Superintendent of Transportation, the
Bus Operator Training teams, Street Supervisors and Dispatchers continue to provide operators with upto-date information to answer customer questions and address customer concerns. The YTD average in
the category for 2017 is 0.35 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2016 was 0.52
complaints per day.
Passed Up Passenger At Stop – 4th Quarter 2017: complaints in this category decreased 6.88%
compared to the same period in 2016. In many cases, “flashbacks” for these complaints will confirm
buses are on route and either on time or running late. It is possible the passenger was not directly at the
stop when the bus arrived. Many complaint comments indicate the passenger was running to the stop
as the bus passed. Operators are reminded to stay vigilant and watch for passengers that may not be
waiting directly at the bus stop. In addition, operators are directed to contact RTD Dispatch whenever a
passenger is passed up due to the bus being full. The number of “Pass Up” complaints from passengers
with disabilities and/or those using mobility aids represents a small number of the total “Pass Up”
complaints (190 of the total 4,050 = 4.69%). Information regarding overcrowded routes is forwarded
to the Service Planning & Scheduling Department for review and adjustment as needed and as resources
will allow. The YTD average in this category for 2017 is 11.1 complaints per day. The comparable
number for 2016 was 11.88 complaints per day.
Although the total number of complaints is lower than the previous year, it is important to note that
ridership is also lower (4th Quarter 2017 = 51,215,869; 4th Quarter 2016 = 58,334,536). Complaints
may be lower because fewer passengers are riding.
Customer Satisfaction Survey
Customer complaints help identify those areas in which RTD and the private contractors can continue to
improve the quality of service provided. Additionally, the results of the 2014 Customer Satisfaction
Survey indicate that the majority of RTD passengers are satisfied with RTD services. On a scale of 1
(very poor) to 5 (excellent), RTD bus service received high ratings in the following operator-related
categories:
Courtesy of bus driver (4.4)
Driving skills (4.4)
Drivers’ knowledge of their specific route (4.4)
Drivers’ ability to answer your questions about bus service (4.3)
Feeling of safety on bus (4.2)
Clarity of onboard stop announcements (4.2)

Quarterly Board of Directors Report
Security Statistics & Fare Inspection Summary
Fourth Quarter ~ October 1 through December 31, 2017

Fare inspectors, security officers, street supervisors, and police officers, conduct fare inspection on-board buses
and light rail vehicles. RTD’s policy is to provide a warning to first time offenders and then to issue a citation if
that person is contacted a second time without fare. The chart below shows the actual number of patrons
without fare that resulted in warnings or citations. The variation in numbers from month to month may be due
to several factors, including special events or other security security-related incidents.

On-Board Enforcement

Transit security officers are assigned to Light Rail and Commuter Rail to check for proper fare and to provide
security. The table below shows how many patrons were contacted for the quarter and the percentage of
patrons that did not present valid fare. There is also a designated transit security officer fare task force, whose
duties are to only ride light rail vehicles and concentrate on fare related issues throughout the service area.

Plain Clothes Police Officer Fare Inspection

Bus Operations/Bus Stops

The following chart lists the number arrests made on buses by police officers by month. Arrests include citations
issued or physical arrests made for criminal violations other than fare evasion. This is an additional advantage to
the plain clothes police fare inspection program as peace officers have the authority to check for warrants and
take the appropriate law enforcement action. This quarter the bus routes inspected include the 15, 16, 31 & 0.

Light Rail Operations
The below chart shows the plain clothes police fare enforcement observations for light rail. There is a slightly
higher fare evasion rate observed by the plain clothes program than for the rail station sweeps and bus
enforcement because of the following factors:
Fare station sweeps are conducted by uniformed security officers; these officers require all patrons to
have fare before boarding vehicles
Rail operators do not have any interface with patrons, while bus operators do ask for fare
Plain clothes police officers do not have a deterrence factor as uniformed officers, thus they inherently
find more violations of fare evasion.

Police Officers are placed on bus and rail vehicles that have been identified by operators, supervisors, dispatch
logs and patrons as having a high perception of fare evasion, fare disputes or other problems.
