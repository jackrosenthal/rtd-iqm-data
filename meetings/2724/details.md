#### 1. May 2018 Service Changes

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors approve the May 2018 Service Change package as revised and summarized in Attachment A resulting in an annualized cost savings of approximately $153,000 and, further, to authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is impacted by these changes.

The Recommended Action proposed falls in line with the following GM Goals:

Core Goal #1 - Successful Delivery of Transit Services

Task Goal #1 - Fiscal Sustainability

Motion:               Director Solano made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the March 27, 2018 Board Meeting.

Director Williams seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Michael Ford, Chief Operations Officer, stated that staff presented the May 2018 Service Changes to the Board approximately two months ago. He added that since the initial presentation staff had conducted public outreach meetings in Boulder, Broomfield, Southeast Denver, and at the Blake Administration Building between February 2, 2018 and March 1, 2018. Mr. Ford explained that staff had received input during the public comment process that resulted in modifications to the initial service recommendations communicated to the Board. He added that the comments and service changes were included in the packet.

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, introduced Jessie Carter to present the changes that had been made in response to public comment since the last presentation.

Jessie Carter, Manager of Service Planning and Scheduling, explained the changes were centered on bus stop consolidation and addressing overcrowding on routes. He added that in response to public comments some of the service changes were rescinded and that staff would continue to analyze to ensure that the agency meets the needs of the public. Mr. Carter stated that all service changes were listed in the Board report and he would go into greater detail if there were questions.

Director Hoy asked how the agency had addressed the letter that the Board had received from the City and County Manager of Broomfield.

Mr. Carter explained that one of the main reasons to reorganize the service in Broomfield was due to congestion on the current location of service. He added that the new locations of stops alleviated traffic congestion and provided an alternative bus stop to serve the requested location.

Director Hoy asked how far was the walk from the housing community to the bus stop currently and what it would be when the stop was moved.

Mr. Carter stated that the current walk was approximately one-eighth of a mile and would increase to one-fourth of a mile.

Chair Tisdale thanked staff for the changes that were implemented to address complaints about service on the C and D lines to the Denver Center of the Performing Arts (DCPA). He explained that past service changes brought people to DCPA for shows and events but return service was removed and customers were left stranded.

Director Lubow asked if staff had spoken to the City of Broomfield staff that wrote the letter. She said that she would vote no to ensure communications stay open and staff addresses Broomfield’s issues.

Mr. Carter stated that staff had been in contact with Broomfield staff and would continue to work towards an acceptable solution.

Director Williams thanked staff for their hard work in the right sizing of the service schedule.

Mr. Carter stated that the area of 12th and Pennsylvania was high density and the agency would continue to look at other stops to accommodate customers.

Mr. Abel explained that RTD was consolidating or moving bus stops and that often when a stop was removed a new stop would be placed to update routes. He added that the agency continued to add or shift stops to accommodate customers and to improve on time performance.

Director Walker asked how long it would take the changes to be synced in the transit applications that people use.

Mr. Carter stated that he would find that information and forward it to the Board.

Director Folska thanked staff for a job well done and for considering and accommodating people with disabilities.

Director Anderson stated that the only thing that would make the service changes better would be the G Line opening, and that she would vote yes.

Director Menten stated that she had no comments and would vote yes.

Committee Chair Deadwyler declared the motion PASSED.
