FEDERAL UPDATE FOR REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT: OCTOBER 13, 2015
Ten-Week Continuing Resolution (CR) to Fund the Federal Government
The start of the Federal fiscal year (FY) came on October 1, with a short-term spending bill
in place to fund the agencies and programs of the Federal government through December
11 at an annualized rate of $1.017 trillion, the spending level for FY 2016 set by the Budget
Control Act.
 Like most programs funded under the CR, surface transportation programs are funded at a
rate that is 0.21% less than their FY 2015 funding level. US DOT will not allocate
discretionary funds, such as New Starts grants, under this short-term CR, but will await a
full-year spending bill.
A Broader Budget Deal in the Works


President Obama, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and outgoing Speaker John
Boehner have begun negotiating a two-year budget blueprint to govern the FY 2016 and
2017 spending bills. Their discussions are focused on finding offsets to pay for increased
discretionary spending above the current statutory caps, as has long been urged by Obama.
House Leadership Elections


Speaker Boehner has scheduled a vote for the House to select its next Speaker on October
29. The new Speaker will then schedule the date for any additional elections to fill other
House GOP leadership positions.
Surface Transportation Reauthorization: Yet Another Extension?


After the collapse of a bid by Ways and Means Chairman Paul Ryan and Senator Chuck
Schumer to fund the next surface transportation bill with repatriated revenues gained
through international tax reform, House authorizers appear deadlocked on the policy
provisions of the bill as well.
o Disagreement over funding levels, hewing to party lines, appears to be the largest
hurdle in both the revenue and policy discussions.
o Neither group has abandoned its efforts, and negotiations continue on parallel
tracks.
o In fact, House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Bill Shuster
still intends to mark up a bi-partisan bill in committee before the October 29
expiration of the current 3-month extension.



Meanwhile, new revenue data released by U.S. DOT has obviated the need for urgent
Congressional action to find a Highway Trust Fund (HTF) revenue solution. The
Department’s latest “Highway Trust Fund Ticker,” which projects the balances in both the
highway and transit accounts over the next year, shows that the $8 billion cash infusion
Congress provided in the late July extension bill (along with revenues from current motor
fuels taxes) will sustain the HTF until July 2016.



Even if the House schedule holds and Chairman Shuster marks up a multi-year policy bill
before October 29, several weeks’ work remains – including adding the revenue component
to the bill. In almost any scenario, another short-term extension appears necessary.
