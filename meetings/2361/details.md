### B. Recommended Actions

No recommended actions were presented.

#### 1. Local Government Update - CRL Associates

Sherry Ellebracht, Government Relations Officer, notified the Directors that Roger Sherman from CRL Associates was not able to attend the meeting.  She reviewed the Local Government Relations update as included in the October 13, 2015 Government Relations Committee agenda packet.

Sherry Ellebracht noted that she attended the Metro Mayors Caucus meeting on October 7th.  The Caucus discussed the Scientific and Cultural Facilities District (SCFD) reauthorization.  She shared that it was quite a discussion with more information to come as the subject develops.

Sherry Ellebracht informed the Directors that the ballots for the November 3rd elections will be mailed out on October 14th.  She added that after the elections Roger Sherman will work with staff to schedule time for the Directors to meet with the newly elected officers.

She pointed out that the Tampa Chamber of Commerce visited Denver and met with many different groups.  Their time with RTD was spent on Transit Oriented Development and FasTracks.  Roger Sherman, along with Kim Kucera, Senior Vice President of CRL Associates, and Bill Sirois, Senior Manager for Transit Oriented Communities, participated in the tour and presentation.  Sherry Ellebracht added that the delegation was very interested in finding out how RTD was able to get FasTracks on the ballot in 2004 and the collaboration that has followed.  Bill Sirois and Roger Sherman emphasized to the delegation that this project has taken time.

Sherry Ellebracht added that Maria Garcia-Berry, CRL Associates Chief Executive Officer, presented on FasTracks at the Transportation for America Innovation Academy.

#### 2. State Legislative Update - Brandeberry~McKenna Public Affairs

Jenifer Brandeberry of Brandeberry~McKenna noted that her firm helped organize a tour of the University of Colorado A Line for the Office of Legal Legislative Services.  She said it is great that Capitol staff has reached out to be educated and knowledgeable in RTD matters and the impact that the agency is having on the region.

She added that the Transportation Legislation Review Committee (TLRC) met a week ago and will meet again on November 2nd.  Brandeberry~McKenna will present the bill drafts to the directors once the TLRC finalizes them.

Jenifer Brandeberry announced January 28th, 2016 from 5:00 – 7:00 p.m. as the date for the Legislative Forum/Educational Session for the General Assembly that Committee Chair Folska and Chair Sisk have been coordinating.  The tentative location is the Gallery at Denver Union Station.

She mentioned that the budget situation of the State will dominate the 120 day Congressional session.  The conversations will determine what, if any, money is available for additional transportation funding at the State level.  Governor Hickenlooper is set to present his budget during the first half of November to the Joint Budget Committee.

Director Lubow wondered if some transportation funds were supposed to be distributed due to a legal requirement from last year.  Jenifer Brandeberry explained that SB 228 came into play for the first time based on the economic recovery; however, there is a formula on how the money is spent.  The formula is affected by TABOR, K-12 funding, Gallagher Amendment, and the Hospital Fee, among others.  She added that the Joint Budget Committee creates the budget forecast based on conservative projections yet the final budget numbers are not available until March.  Jenifer Brandeberry said that she would create a one page document explaining how the formula works.  Director Lubow noted that it was truly outstanding to listen to the complexity of the process and was not quite sure that a one page document would explain the complexity.  Marla Lien, General Counsel, informed the Directors that Heather Copp, Chief Financial Officer, will create the document Jenifer Brandeberry alluded to since she used to be the Deputy Executive Director for the Colorado Department of Revenue.  Committee Chair Folska asked Jenifer Brandeberry to confirm that the Constitution of the State of Colorado is quite extensive.  Jenifer Brandeberry agreed that it is one of the largest in the nation.

Director Francone asked Jenifer Brandeberry to confirm that Propositions AA and BB on the ballot for November will not affect RTD.  Jenifer Brandeberry confirmed that those two propositions if passed will not have an effect on funding for RTD.

Director Francone added that she would find the one page document explaining the formula for SB 228 helpful.

Committee Chair Folska noted that she enjoyed working with Director Francone and Mike Dino, Principal from Squire Patton Boggs, on the Federal Staff Forum held on August 26th at Denver Union Station.  She added that moving forward it is important to keep providing these kinds of opportunities at the State level in order for the Directors to have face to face time to build relationships and keep contributing to the cooperative bipartisan coalition.  She pointed that this coalition is not easy but it is simple.

#### 3. Federal Update - Squire Patton Boggs

Mike Dino, Squire Patton Boggs, noted the historic significance of seeing the House of Representatives in a leadership quandary since The Hon. John Boehner announced his resignation as the Speaker of the House.  He noted that the Republicans are hoping The Hon. Paul Ryan would be the next Speaker.

He pointed out that House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Bill Shuster still intends to present a bi-partisan bill in committee before the October 29th expiration of the current 3 month extension for the Highway Trust Fund (HTF).  Mike Dino added that the $8 billion cash infusion to the HTF in July will sustain it until July 2016.

Mike Dino said that the White House and Congress are setting final budget resolutions in order to pass the Fiscal Year 2016 Budget.

He ended his remarks congratulating RTD for winning one of two nationwide Federal Transit Administration’s 2015 Outstanding Achievement Award of Excellence in Environmental Documentation Preparation for the Southeast Rail Extension.

Director Lubow said she had heard that the Senate approved some kind of change to the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) definition but the House of Representatives has not.  She asked Mike Dino to expand on this.  Mike Dino replied that the changes made were reported a few months back to the Board and that he could review the report with the Directors again.  The changes are not what RTD requested as the corridor still has to be dedicated.  Director Lubow wondered if the House was amenable to the changes RTD is pursuing.  Mike Dino said that Squire Patton Boggs is working on that.

Director Francone noted that there is a buzz among the Federal staffers of the fantastic forum held at Denver Union Station on August 26th.  Mike Dino added that RTD has some great opportunities to keep inviting Federal staffers to tour RTD properties, such as the Elati Maintenance Facility.

Director Francone mentioned that conversations with staffers for both The Hon. Ken Buck and The Hon. Cory Gardner pointed to agreements with RTD’s definition of BRT.  She added that she will personally invite the staffers to the January 28th Legislative Forum.  Director Folska stressed the importance of all Board members attending this Legislative Forum.

### D. Other Matters

Marla Lien, General Counsel, informed the Board that to her understanding they would be safe not showing up tomorrow to the City and County of Denver (Denver) court.  She is working on gathering better information through RTD Security staff’s personal contacts with Denver’s District Attorney Office.  Director Francone noted that she will be attending.

### F. Adjourn

Committee Chair Folska adjourned the meeting at 8:25 p.m.
