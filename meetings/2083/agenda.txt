GENERAL MANAGER’S REPORT

UNANIMOUS CONSENT
A. Authorization to Award the Construction Contract for the Table Mesa Pedestrian Bridge
Project
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to enter
into a construction contract with PCL Construction Company in the amount of
$6,448,938.59. This contract is for the construction of the RTD pedestrian bridge over
US36 at Table Mesa Drive and associated bus pull-out and plaza improvements. Funding for
this project is partially from CDOT ($3.5M, Senate Bill #1 IGA signed October 28, 2010) and
partially from RTD FasTracks local funds. The funding for this project is included in the 2011
FasTracks budget.
B. Extension and Amendment of Goldman Sachs Contract
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to authorize the second option year of the
contract with Goldman Sachs for Financial Services Related to Public–Private Partnerships
advisory services which will extend the performance period from September 1, 2011 to
August 31, 2012. The original contract period was from September 1, 2007 to August 31,
2010 with two one-year options to extend, and the first of these two options was exercised
in August 2010.
Additionally, it is recommended that the contract scope be amended to include, on a workorder basis, assistance in the review and development of proposals, which may include a
possible availability-based concession or other public-private partnership arrangement
involving all or a portion of the remaining RTD FasTracks projects such as North Metro, I225, US 36, Northwest Rail and the Southeast and Southwest extensions. This contract
amendment would increase the maximum value of the contract by $2,500,000, to a new
combined contract maximum of $19,868,250 for Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan. Funding
for this work-order contract amendment in 2011 is included in the 2011 Amended expense
budget for FasTracks, and funding for 2012 will be included in the 2012 expense and capital
budgets for FasTracks.
C. Resolution No._______ Series of 2011, Appointment of Trustees to the RTD Pension
