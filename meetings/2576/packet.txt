Election of 2017 Board Officers
Chair Pro Tem Hoy remarked that, as stated in the Board Bylaws, in the first official
meeting of the year the Board elects the Officers of Chair, First Vice Chair, Second

election begins with the position of Chair and worked through the process to all
Executive Committee seats. Board members making the nominations, seconders,
and any other requested speakers will be given three minutes to speak on behalf of
their candidate for each position.
Chair Pro Tem Hoy noted he would ask for other nominations and, when there are
no more nominations, the nominations would close and votes would be cast by
secret ballot. Two Board members who are not running for the position, along with
General Counsel will count the votes and provide the tally back to the Chair Pro
Tem for announcement. He added that, if no candidate receives eight affirmative
votes, the vote process would be repeated. Chair Pro Tem Hoy said that, should
the vote go into multiple rounds, Board members who wished to speak further on
behalf of a candidate with new or additional information to share could do so. He
stated the vote would be done in round-robin fashion and each speaker would be
limited to three minutes.

C. Updates
Chair Hoy gave a brief overview of what updates are and how the new Board
Directors can use the updates to help inform themselves on future issues that they
will be required to vote on. He also mentioned that they are allowed to follow up
with anyone on staff for further information on issues that arise that they are not
sure of; for more in-depth explanations.

• 16th Street Mall Pavers Contract
Jyotsna Vishwakarma, Chief Engineer, provided a brief background about the
Free Mall Ride for the new Board Members. She stated that the Free Mall
Ride runs between Union Station and Civic Center Plaza on the 16th Street
Mall and provides free shuttle rides to approximately 30,000 passengers a
day. She stated that a portion of the mall from Civic Center Plaza to Market
Street was built in the early 80’s, with granite pavers as the surfacing
materials. Jyotsna stated that the right of way is owned by the City and
County of Denver but RTD took on the maintenance of the pavers where the
busses run in 1984.
Jyotsna stated that the pavers need to be maintained regularly and for the
past three years RTD has been spending approximately $1.1 million a year on
repairs. Since 2014 the City and County of Denver has contributed 300,000
a year to help with the maintenance, as part of a ten-year agreement. RTD
awards the paver maintenance contract in three-year increments. The
current contract ends in February 2017, and RTD has advertised the contract

during the month of December 2016. She stated that procurement is
currently reviewing the bids and will be requesting approval of the contract
award at the next Planning/Capital Improvement & FasTracks committee
meeting.

• Denver Moves: Transit Overview
Lacy Bell, Manager of Corridor Planning, introduced Kristina Evanoff, Transit
Project Manager, with the City and County of Denver. Kristina presented an
overview of the Denver Moves program and how RTD and the CCD will be
working together to coordinate a study to help improve mobility. Kristina’s
overview included the mobility challenges Denver should be expecting and
how transit can be the solution for the growth of our city. The Denver
Moves study will be used to evaluate traffic management strategies.
Kristina’s team will be conducting an outreach study that can assist us in
planning for the future.
Director Folska mentioned that she attended an event with Councilwoman
Black regarding this and thinks it is a good initiative. She also mentioned
that the walkability near the Southmoor Park & Ride is poor. She would like
there to be more discussion about businesses working cohesively to ensure
that walkability around high traffic areas are addressed.
Director Walker informed the Board that he is currently on the Blueprint
Denver taskforce. The City does recognize that RTD transit is part of the
City and they have to work cohesively with us because it affects everyone,
not agency specific. Director Walker encouraged his fellow Board Members
to work with their jurisdictions and districts to encourage them to work on a
plan for transit, not to benefit RTD but to benefit their constituents.
Director Francone stated that she wants to see the State of the System
assessment once it is done. She also mentioned that she hopes that biking
and walking mobility is also being reviewed. Director Francone suggested
enforcement on biking and walking rules, stating that without rules for all
mobility, traffic problems can arise. She believes that rules need to be
enforced across the board. She is also requesting to meet with Kristina offline regarding this study.
Director Folska stated that the protected bike lanes are an issue for blind
people. She expressed her own frustrations of having to deal them and
would have appreciated forewarning about this change.

C. Updates

• Local Update - CRL Associates, Inc.
Roger Sherman from CRL Associates extended his congratulations to the
new and re-elected members. Mr. Sherman stated that not too much
happened over the holiday season; however, transportation is the prime
focus. He mentioned that he was going to be attending the Metro Mayor’s
Caucus on Saturday, January, 14, 2017. Lastly, Mr. Sherman stated that
he plans to guide and counsel the poll and share the results upon its
completion.
Director Francone asked a question about an article she read that Denver
City Council approved $1 million for transportation for the homeless; she
asked Mr. Sherman if he had any additional information on that matter.
Mr. Sherman replied that he did not have any information but he would look
into it and report back to the Board.
Director Lubow asked Mr. Sherman if in his conversations the completion of
FasTracks has ever been discussed. If not, Director Lubow asked that che
please raise this to their attention.

Mr. Sherman responded that there would need to be a new funding stream
that would ultimately have to be approved by the voters. Transportation is
definitely on the top of everyone’s agenda; however, he does not have
enough information and deferred to Jenifer Brandeberry to share any
additional information during her segment of the meeting.

Director Sisk stressed the importance of rebuilding our relationship with the
Metro Mayors’ Caucus.

• State Update - Brandeberry McKenna
Jenifer Brandeberry of Brandeberry McKenna offered her congratulations to
the new and returning Board Members. She stated that on Wednesday,
January 11, 2017, the General Assembly convenes and that one of the high
priorities is an attempt to get Democrats and Republicans to come together
in a bi-partisan way to put together transportation funding proposal to refer
to the voters. She reminded the Board that the Republicans control the
Senate. Ms. Brandeberry stated that some of the legislators think that any
monies directed towards transit is a dime too much. She also explained that
it is going to take some strategic negotiations and conversations to get buyin. She remarked that it is good that President Grantham and Speaker of the
House have been meeting with a small group of stakeholders. This small
group is compiling a handful of ideas of what the proposal could look like
and helping craft universal polling questions that are not driven strictly by
the Front Range. Ms. Brandeberry stated there is an agreement that new
revenue streams are needed; however, diverting monies from the General
Fund could harm the Democratic Party because those monies could be pulled
from Education. Ms. Brandeberry urged us to all work together as part of a
statewide team because it is a high level topic that may take time to get
funding for.

• Federal Update - Squire Patton Boggs
Mike Dino of Squire Patton Boggs echoed the congratulatory sentiments of
everyone before him. Mr. Dino said that Congress started up a week ago
and during his visit to Washington D.C., he believes that everything went
positive. He stated that both U.S. Senators Bennett and Gardner have a
good relationship and believes they will work well together. Mr. Dino stated
2017 full budget has not been approved yet because Congress is in a
Continuing Resolution phase due to the Presidential transition and that parts
of the budget will be approved mid-March. He said Elaine Chao is well
respected on the Hill and will have any easy transition into her role as

Transportation Secretary. He also stated that tax credits will be a big part
of President Trump’s plan which could help fund big infrastructures. He also
mentioned that earmarks will not be returning.

Director Sisk stated that he attended the 36 Commuting Solutions 8th Legislative
Breakfast; along with Directors Hoy, Lubow, and Tisdale. The breakfast focused on
the monies Colorado spends on transportation in comparison to other similarly sized
states. Director Sisk stressed the importance of the Board of Directors being
involved in the on-going discussions with legislators and Stakeholders to ensure
constituents are knowledgeable about the importance of transportation issues.
Director Francone reported out on the legislative breakfast that she and Kent Bagley
attended on Thursday, January 5, 2017. She stated that transportation was at the
top of both parties’ agendas. During the breakfast Representative Neville pointed
out that the budget for Colorado over the past couple of years has double;
however, there hasn’t been an increase to transportation. Director Francone
mentioned the importance of breaking the misconception that RTD is using all the
transportation dollars in the budget. She asserted the fact that RTD has successful
P3 projects and that planners at the local, state, and federal level should be looking
towards us for assistance. Director Francone also wanted to remind everyone that
there will be a legislative meet and greet on February 8, 2017 at the Cooper
Lounge. Chair Folska secured the lounge for the event at no cost.
Director Menten asked Mr. Sherman if the polling was going out to the public or
just to within specific areas. Mr. Sherman replied that it will be polling of voters.
Director Menten also asked who is going to be funding the polling project. Mr.
Sherman responded that there are a number of different entities that are paying for
the polling projects from non-profits to other government agencies. Director
Menten wanted to know what level of results the Board will be receiving from the
poll. Mr. Sherman stated that he was not sure how much information will be
shared with RTD.
General Manager Genova commented on the relationship with the Metro Mayors’
Caucus. He expressed the fact that Mr. Sherman and he are working on having a
more pro-active role with the caucus. He also mentioned that they are working
with state leadership from both houses on transportation issues and letting them
know that RTD has the knowledge base on transit and can definitely assist in those
conversations.
General Manager Genova explained that his late notice about presenting at Wheat
Ridge Council was a last minute request by the city; he apologized not getting
information to the Board sooner. He said that they did receive questions about the
G-Line. However, he couldn’t give them too much information because substantial

progress on the A-Line needs to be completed before any further tests can be ran
on the G-Line.

General Manager Genova also reference to some recent information that was
released on Tuesday, January 10, 2017, in reference to the University of Colorado
A-Line.
RTD did an analysis of all the trips from Denver Union Station to Denver
International Airport that have occurred since the opening in April, and the study
showed a 97.7% of all the trips were within 15 minutes of their scheduled time.
Director Folska advised the Board that there would be a welcoming event for all
new and returning legislators on Thursday, January 19, 2017 at the Warwick Hotel
from 4:00 p.m. – 6:00 p.m.
Director Menten thanked General Manager Genova and Henry Stopplecamp for the
good presentation in Wheat Ridge. She proposed the idea of presenting for other
city entities.
General Manager Genova thanked Director Menten for attending Wheat Ridge’s
Council meeting.
Director Broom asked General Manager Genova, if and when the FRA gives the
green light, what is the time frame for the commencement of the operations of the
G-Line.
General Manager Genova stated that RTD is working through the schedule with
Denver Transit Partners. He advised the Board that RTD has put together an
implementation plan with five major action items and submitted it to the FRA.
They are currently working through those items; however, in doing so they are
coming across other items that need to be done. General Manager Genova stated
that once they have a time frame, the Board will be the first to know.
Director Anderson stated that it is important for everyone to know that the delay in
the G-Line is not costing RTD but is costing Denver Transit Partners. She stated
that her constituents want to know who is paying the flaggers at each of the
crossings.

General Manager Genova also informed the Board that John Aguilar, a journalist
from the Denver Post, was also at the Wheat Ridge council meeting and penned an
article regarding RTD. In the meantime, other media outlets have picked up the
story and are requesting information. General Manager Genova stated that since
the G-Line did not open in 2016 and since they have not put out any new
expectations or presented any completion dates. The communications team is
working diligently on working on media requests.

C. Updates

• Smart Card Project Update
Heather Copp, Chief Financial Officer and Assistant General Manager of
Finance and Administration, said that the latest Smart Card project update
was included in the packet. She added that staff wanted to update the
Board with what has been going on in relation to the Notice to Cure and the
overall status of the project as of January. She reminded the Board the that
Notice to Cure had three items which required mitigation: Payment card
industry (PCI) compliance, platform validator issues, and fraud reports. She
stated that Xerox has since delivered a Notice of Attestation which indicated
that a third party reviewed the web portals and they are now PCI Compliant.
Xerox is required to provide additional documentation such as a security plan
and implementation guide to RTD by February 10, 2017. Ms. Copp said
that, currently, staff is happy with that due date.
Heather Copp added that the platform validator screens are going black as a
result of heat and/or direct sunlight. Xerox has researched the issue for the
past few months and has reached out to three sets of teams to work on the
problem. Two teams are located in New Jersey and France, and there is a
third party reviewing the issue as well. A solution is expected to be
received in mid-February, but in the interim, Xerox has extended RTD’s
hardware warranty that expired at the end of December. She stated that
most of the issues in the Notice to Cure will be finalized in mid to late
February. There will be a post-solution document that will need to be
agreed upon by both parties, but Xerox is getting close to fixing the longterm issues. She noted that staff has made a lot of progress in the last two
to three weeks, and they are happy with the advancement of the project.

6.D

Heather Copp noted that Xerox formed a new company, Conduent, and they
will be in charge of RTD’s contract. Conduent is an independently traded
company as of January 9th, and the sales representative, Crissy Ditmore,
attended the meeting. Ms. Copp said that RTD’s new project manager,
Brian Gebhardt, was unable to attend but he will be working on the project
and taking us through the next phases.

Heather Copp indicated that RTD was disputing over $350,000 worth of
work, and Xerox conceded that amount.
Director Lubow asked about the fraud reports and why Xerox would want to
move it off of the Notice to Cure.
Heather Copp stated that Xerox asked RTD to move the fraud reports from
the Notice to Cure, a default status, to a non-formal process of puts and
takes. She added that staff felt that one item could be moved to the nonformal process.
Director Sisk thanked Crissy Ditmore for attending and said it was a good
start with the new company. He noted that RTD and Conduent’s objectives
are clearly the same, which is getting the Smart Card launched. He added
that it is important to make sure that staff’s time is spent in a positive way,
and he would like to see the update report show more yellow’s to reflect
progress.
Director Mihalik asked if there were any other significant changes with the
new team, besides the new program manager.
Heather Copp stated that there should be less red tape involved and fewer
approvals required on Conduent’s end.
Crissy Ditmore indicated that she is new to the company. She said that she
has business relationships with other transit providers in the area and she
knew the platforms that Conduent was developing would bring end-to-end
constituent experiences. She noted that the process change from Xerox to
Conduent was done because the current Xerox business model is
problematic the way that it is. She stated that Conduent is building out how
the different businesses work and streamlining them together.
Director Francone stated that the Board is very frustrated with not having
the product in hand. She added that there is a high level of frustration and
that the Board is expecting great things. She asked if the removal of the
Packet Pg. 25

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 17, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Archuleta asked if there were any concessions from Xerox, and if
so, what they were.

6.D

fraud issues from the Notice to Cure would bring pressure off of Conduent
to bring this contract to completion.
Heather Copp remarked that, because the fraud reports were included in the
Notice to Cure, RTD has made its point regarding that issue. She added that
if it were the PCI compliance or screen validator issue she would have
objected to the removal to the non-formal process.

Heather Copp said that it comes down to tap information. The bus system
has very good information, but light rail and commuter rail does not have
good data because people are not tapping their cards. She added that if
Boulder County and Longmont are looking for information on individual
routes, staff is unable to extrapolate that data set at this time.
Director Solano indicated that RTD is bleeding money off of the commuter
and light rail lines. He said in Los Angeles, for example, riders have to pay
before entering the turnstile. He stated that RTD’s current design makes no
sense, and therefore the system is losing money.
Heather Copp explained that every passenger on the University of Colorado
A Line and B Line is checked and that fare enforcement teams of three
began in December at the highest boarding and alighting locations.
General Manager Genova asked the security staff to go through the
statistical information for light rail with Director Solano. He added that the
information on fare evasion rates were the lowest that the has ever seen.
Director Solano said the Board is wasting time with the Smart Card Program
as the tap on and off system is a poor design. He added that it will be an
ongoing issue as people will be able to evade fares because they can.
Director Deadwyler stated that she gets a lot of complaints about taps not
registering at the validator. She asked how reliable the validator machines
were.
Heather Copp explained that the machines are fairly reliable but it is difficult
to say otherwise unless a constituent calls RTD to investigate. She noted
that staff usually gets the most calls when colleges and universities reactivate student passes for the fall semester.

Packet Pg. 26

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 17, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Lubow commented that people in Boulder County and Longmont
want to see how successful the pass programs have been but stated that
staff will not provide that information.

6.D

Director Deadwyler remarked that the system is inconsistent and that
constituents worry that they will be thrown off the train or talked to in an
embarrassing way.
Heather Copp commented that if a constituent has an issue with their tap,
staff encourages them to call in with the number on top of the machines so
that RTD can investigate their issue.

Crissy Ditmore indicated that there were none and that RTD was the only
one to issue a Notice to Cure.
Director Williams asked whether a fare enforcement officer would be able to
tell if a rider had attempted to tap his or her card.
Tonya Anderson, Manager of Electronic Fare Operations, said yes, the
officer will be able to see that a tap was attempted.
General Manager Genova asked staff to put together a memo for the Board
regarding fare enforcement and evasion.

• November 2016 Monthly Financial Statements
Doug MacLeod, Controller, indicated that the November numbers were
included in the Board Packet. He noted that sales and use taxes are still
below budget, at 3.8%. He added that even though RTD is short of budget,
staff is seeing increases year over year. He explained that ridership has
been short all year and is 5.8% short of the budgeted amount. He added
that fare revenue is up 11%.
Director Williams asked if staff had any ideas as to why the ridership
numbers were down.
Doug MacLeod said many agencies across the nation have lower ridership
numbers. He stated that it is difficult to pinpoint the exact cause since the
economy is good and there has been a growth in population.
General Manager Genova commented that there are a variety of variables
that impact ridership. He noted that fuel costs and employment percentages
are always good indicators but stated that some routes that have had gains
instead of losses. He added that nationally ridership was down for last year.
Director Lubow inquired about the sales and use forecasts from the CU
Leeds School of Business (Leeds). She asked if it would be appropriate to
re-think that policy and adjust RTD’s forecasts to be more conservative.
Packet Pg. 27

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 17, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Committee Chair Menten asked how many entities have a situation similar to
RTD’s.

6.D

General Manager Genova added that as staff reports uses a very different
forecasting model when reporting financial information each month than was
used for the 2004 estimates for FasTracks.
Director Lubow commented that RTD needs to rethink how it looks at Leeds
to afford the agency more flexibility.
Heather Copp remarked that small changes in long range forecasts become
exponential after the year 2025.
Director Broom asked if staff has estimates on how much RTD loses from
sales and use tax revenues from internet sales.
Heather Copp said no, but staff can extrapolate on work done by the
Colorado Department of Revenue. She stated that online retailers that do
not have nexus in Colorado will be required to report numbers to the state.
She added that with Amazon having nexus in the state, they keep growing
and their tax liabilities could be millions of dollars each month.
Doug MacLeod added that, since Amazon has started to collect taxes for
RTD, there has been a significant increase in sales and use taxes over last
year.
Director Tisdale asked if the year-to-date variances are in relation to the
initial budget or the amended budget.
Heather Copp stated that the variances are in relation to the adopted
amended budget.

Packet Pg. 28

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 17, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Heather Copp noted that traditionally RTD has used Leeds’ baseline, or
middle, forecast. She said that last year, during the Amended Budget
Process, RTD amended that forecast to the lower forecast. She noted that
in preparation for the 2017 forecast, staff has decided to use Leeds’ lower
forecast and will put any additional funds received into the operating
reserve. She stated that, if additional funds do not materialize, then there
will not be additional money added to the operating reserve. She said this
was a better option, because if RTD continued to use the baseline forecast
and the funds did not materialize, RTD could be spending money it did not
have.

B. Recommended Actions

• Award of Access-a-Ride Service Contracts
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that
the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to
enter into contracts with MV Transportation, Transdev, and Via Mobility
Services for the provision of Access-a-Ride service using dedicated vehicles.
These contracts are for three years, with two one-year options for a total of
5-years, for a 5-year cost of $175,341,294.00. In addition, RTD will
reimburse the contractors’ direct fuel costs in an amount estimated to be
$20,715,915.00 for the total 5-year term. The total 5-year not-to-exceed
amount for Access-a-Ride dedicated-vehicle service and fuel is
$196,057,209.00.
It is further recommended by the Operations and Customer Service
Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his
designee, to enter into contracts with MV Transportation and Transdev for
the provision of Access-a-Ride service using non-dedicated (contractor
provided) vehicles. These contracts are for three years, with two one-year
options for a total of 5-years, at a not-to-exceed 5-year cost of
$38,918,913.00. Fuel for the non-dedicated vehicle contracts is included in
the service contract price. These recommendations represent the most
responsive and responsible proposals received in response to Request for
Proposals (RFP) 16-DH-047 (dedicated vehicle) and 16-DH-046 (nondedicated vehicle) to provide Access-a-Ride Service. The contracts to
provide this service are scheduled to be effective April 1, 2017.
Motion:

Director Sisk made the motion to move this item
to the full Board at the January 24, 2017, Board
Meeting.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 17, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Folska was absent. Committee Chair Anderson and Director Deadwyler left the
meeting early.

6.E

Director Tisdale seconded the motion.
Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations,
stated that staff has experienced challenges in the Access-aRide program for the past two years. He noted that the
Denver market has changed since the last Request for
Proposal (RFP) process and staff decided against options for
this year in order to improve the quality of RTD’s services. He
indicated that what the Board sees in front of them is an
action item where RFP’s were issued.
Director Solano stated that Access-a-Ride runs at a constant
loss, and cannot understand why the providers would want to
get into this type of business.
Director Lubow asked what the change in contract price was
from the old RFP to the new RFP.
Committee Chair Anderson said that staff could provide those
numbers offline.
Director Francone commented that, under the financial impact
section, it looks as though the internal evaluation determined
that RTD could provide this service at a better price.
Bruce Abel said staff’s assumptions were in relation to labor
cost per hour rather than the cost of services provided by RTD
internally, and yes, the contractor estimates were higher than
staff’s estimates due to the increase in contractor wages.
Director Deadwyler remarked that, as a user of Access-a-Ride,
she has been very dissatisfied with the service. She said there
are some challenges with how the system is run and RTD
cannot fix the current issues by sinking more money into it.
She added that the entire system needs to be evaluated to
determine how it can be improved.
Bruce Abel explained that strategically staff is attempting to
address several issues. He stated that, when a customer calls
in, schedules are developed and manifests are sent to the
service providers the night before the service is to take place.
Currently, eight to nine pick-ups are standard in the course of
the day, but driver call-offs require re-deployment of manifests
in order to transport everyone with reservations for that day.
Those re-designed manifests end up with trips that were not

intended to fit those additional people, creating longer or out
of the way routes. He remarked that staff is attempting to
address the driver call-offs with this new RFP. He said that
while the RFP will not solve all of the Access-a-Ride problems,
it should fix many of them.

Committee Chair Anderson recommended that Director
Deadwyler discuss all of her concerns with staff offline.
Larry Buter, Manager of Paratransit Services, stated that as
Bruce Abel articulated, the call-offs are a direct byproduct of
fatigue. He commented that the goal of this procurement is to
get drivers to fill the gap.
Director Broom asked how the progress payments would be
paid.
Bruce Abel stated that the contractor provides RTD with an
hours provided invoice every month, which staff reviews,
approves, and then pays.
Director Broom inquired as to what recourse RTD has for nonperformance.
Bruce Abel stated that RTD can get liquidated damages or that
staff can cancel the contract if the provider is not in line with
RTD’s performance standards.
Director Williams commented that there are driver shortages
everywhere and asked if RTD has software that could adjust
the manifests automatically.
Bruce Abel said, in order to route match riders affected by a
driver call-off, dispatch must manually enter them into the
manifests.
Larry Buter added that the software is called ShowRec. He
said there is only so much that the computer can do and route
matching would still require manual entry.

Director Deadwyler indicated that there is something wrong
with the system that makes drivers call off and not go to
work.

Director Lubow remarked that, if even a Board member such
as Director Deadwyler is unhappy with this service, there are
larger issues that need to be addressed.
Director Solano indicated that pay equity is a large issue and
that is one of the main reasons that RTD cannot keep drivers.

Director Tisdale seconded the observations by Director
Williams. He added that this action item addresses the issues
raised by Director Deadwyler and there are appropriate
measures in place to protect RTD should any of the providers
fail to perform in accordance with the service standards.
Committee Chair Anderson stated that she has received a lot
of phone calls and complaints about the Access-a-Ride
service. She hopes this new process allows staff to attract
and keep drivers to prevent driver fatigue and call-offs. She
commended staff for doing an excellent job and noted that
these contracts were not up for renewal but rather were an
intervention by staff to provide better Access-a-Ride service.

• Access-a-Ride Travel Training Project
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee
that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee
to enter into a contract with Via Mobility Services for the provision of
Travel Training services. Performance under the contract is for a one (1)
year period and shall not exceed $134,040.
Director Lubow made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the January 24, 2017,
Board Meeting.
Director Tisdale seconded the motion.
Discussion:

Bruce Abel stated that travel training is a strategy which
teaches people with disabilities to use fixed route services. He
noted that Via Mobility has been working with RTD for years
to teach individuals how to use the fixed route services.
Director Williams said Via Mobility does an excellent job. She
added that their program works and the training is helpful and
very empowering for those who go through the program.
Director Francone asked if the average price of $1,400.00 per
participant was accurate, and if so, what RTD gets in return
for that cost.
Larry Buter commented that the cost does average out to
$1,400.00 per participant, but this particular training adds a
new component to the mix, which is fixed route service. He
noted that Access-a-Ride can pick someone up at home, take
them to a fixed route transfer point, then pick them up again
on the back end of their trip to their final destination. He
stated that staff will be working with some of the participants
of this program to design the travel training program for 2018.
He noted that this is not intended for every single Access-aRide passenger, but there are many people that would benefit
from this training.
Bruce Abel remarked that while the per participant cost is
$1,400.00, if they are eventually able to make multiple trips
with fixed route service, RTD would recoup those funds.

Director Francone stated that marketing is critical to
encourage people to participate in this program and added that
removing the fear factor out of transit is important.
Director Deadwyler indicated that the only time she has had
satisfactory service was with Via Mobility. She added that
this program should be viewed as a pilot program to see if it
will work before investing a lot of money.

Chair Hoy asked how participant successes are measured.
Bruce Abel commented that Via Mobility tracks how many
trips are taken on fixed route services in comparison to trips
on Access-a-Ride.
Director Williams stated that the training program is not new.
She explained that, beyond measuring how successful it is, it
is beneficial to RTD’s image to show that the agency is
involved and offers travel training. She added that it is a good
thing for RTD in more ways than those mentioned tonight.
Director Anderson remarked that whomever RTD can help to
use fixed route services has more freedom than someone who
has to call in and order Access-a-Ride, which is a good thing.

C. Updates

• May 2017 Service Changes

Jessie Carter, Manager of Service Planning and Scheduling, said this service
change is relatively small as there are only a few changes that are service
reductions, such as route 40. Other changes relate to routes 8, 19, and the
B line schedule.
Director Solano stated that a newspaper article in Commerce City said that
route 62 is only going to be partially open and running.
Jessie Carter remarked that route 62 was part of the January service
change, but part of the street has not been conveyed to either Commerce
City or the City of Denver. Until the street is conveyed, RTD is operating on
a detour.
Director Sisk asked staff to add additional service from the McCaslin park-nride.
Director Menten asked for the meeting locations for the community outreach
meetings.
Jessie Carter indicated that the list is being finalized and updated due to the
Presidents’ Day holiday.
Director Francone asked that service planning coordinate with the Board
Office so that the Directors can know when all of the public outreach
meetings occur.
Director Solano inquired if staff is flexible as to where the outreach meetings
occur as he is hosting a meeting on January 28th at Adams City High
School. He asked if someone from service planning could attend that
meeting with him to answer any questions that group may have.

• Cost Share Agreements Under $250,000
Bruce Abel said as an update staff is bringing forth information about cost
share agreements under $250,000. Since 1992, RTD has contributed to
support the Littleton Shopping Cart, which was originated to serve portions
of certain routes previously served by RTD. He said this is a free service
Packet Pg. 37

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 17, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Bruce Abel stated that RTD has service changes three times a year. As part
of the process, staff comes to the Board with routes that will be going out
to the public for comment. After all of the public feedback comments are
received, staff will seek final approval from the Board.

available to the residents of Littleton and the estimated cost for 2017 is
$30,861. In January 2004, RTD discontinued Route 47 and, as an
alternative, RTD entered into an agreement with a local non-profit to provide
a new community-based service. Focus Points Resource Center (FPRC) has
long been an advocate and resource for communities in Denver and the
estimated costs for 2017 is $53,240. In 2010, Via Mobility, a non-profit
organization, applied for and received a Transportation Equity Act for the
21st Century New Freedom grant to coordinate transportation services
provided by Via Mobility and RTD in the city of Longmont. Currently, Via
Mobility and RTD are coordinating services between Via, Call-n-Ride, and
Access-a-Ride to determine which trips can be operated on Via and Call-nRide services. Local matches of the grant will be provided by Via Mobility,
the City of Longmont, and RTD. The estimated cost for the Longmont
Coordination of Services in 2017 is $12,000.

• 2016 Securement Area Issues Report
Bruce Abel explained that, as part of the settlement agreement with
Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition (CCDC), staff has committed to provide
an annual report communicating the number of occurrences where RTD was
unable to accommodate individuals with mobility devices on fixed route
buses and RTD’s reason for not being able to accommodate them. The
majority of the occurrences in 2016 related to the fact that there were
already two mobility devices on board the bus, which is the maximum
number allowed.

• Lost Service Hours Update
Bruce Abel commented that staff has discussed the challenges on the
paratransit side already and added that the fixed route providers are
experiencing the same issues. He noted that staff is working towards
addressing the fixed route head count.
Director Lubow noted that RTD was successful with the sign-on bonus and
asked if that has lost its appeal.
Bruce Abel stated that staff routinely meets with human resources,
marketing, and other departments to brainstorm the best way to market
open positions. He noted that the holidays are challenging periods to bring
on new staff but welcomed any suggestions.
General Manager Genova added that staff works closely with the union
leadership as well. He explained that the driver shortage is not always about
wages. The bus operators have a challenging job, especially if they are
working split shifts. Staff continues to work with the union and others to
best address these issues.

• Pass Program Study Update

The Pass Program Working Group’s objectives were to:
 Revisit and refine goals for each pass program
 Refine pricing and administration of each pass program
 Recommend pass program policy revisions
 Recommend criteria for RTD to use in evaluating future proposals
for new pass programs
Guiding Principles are:
 Brand loyalty
 Convenience
 Cost-effectiveness
 Equitable access
 Increased ridership
 Meet strategic budget plan targets
 Revenue certainty
 Simplifying rider-operator interactions
Recent Activities include:
 Hiring of a facilitator – Hughes Collaboration
 Interviewing of key internal staff members
 In the process of procuring technical consultant support services
 The selection of 26 working group members
Mike Hughes, President of Hughes Collaboration, stated that inclusion and
representation were at the forefront of the working group selection.
Inclusion incorporated all perspectives and all key stakeholders from pass
users, riders who do not use passes, business interests and advocacy
groups. Representation ensured that each seat at the table was assigned to
someone who had credibility with the group he or she seeks to represent.
The working group will meet each month under the following guidelines:
 Meetings will be open to the public and advertised on the RTD
Board calendar
 Public comment will occur at the beginning of each meeting
 Each meeting will be convened in different locations throughout
the district
 Consensus must be met on all recommendations made to staff

Michael Washington, Title VI Manager, stated that in September 2015 the
Board approved changes to the EcoPass programs with a commitment to:
 Convene an RTD and Stakeholder Pass Program working group
 Define Goals for pass programs
 Revisit pricing for pass programs

6.E

Director Menten asked staff to confirm that this working pass group will
only focus on the Eco and Neighborhood Eco Passes (NECO), and not try to
evaluate a low-income fare study.

General Manager Genova stated, that when RTD went through the fare
structure analysis in 2014, the Board asked staff to put together a working
group to examine all of the pass programs. He added that RTD gets a lot of
requests from cities, school districts, counties, and communities for a
specific type of local pass, which is challenging for staff to examine. Based
on the feedback that staff has received, they are broadening the scope of
the working group. He remarked that staff wants the working group to
enter the process with an open mind, and unbiased, to develop a good
product.
Director Menten indicated that she did not see the taxpayers represented in
this group. She said someone from the Colorado Union of Taxpayers, for
example, would be a good addition.
Director Williams remarked that she would like to see a representative from
the Veterans’ groups added to the working group.
Director Francone stated that a representative from higher education is
absent from this working group and would like to see them included as well.
Committee Chair Anderson suggested that a representative from the
Jefferson County Economic Development Association be added to the
working group. She stated that they are attracting corporations that may
use Eco Passes, and it would be good to get their feedback as to how Eco
Passes could be used in Jefferson County.
Mike Hughes commented that the list does not display how the
conversations lead him to the people that ended up making the list.
General Manager Genova added that the members of the working group
made a monthly commitment to meet for four hours, and a lot of people that
Mr. Hughes contacted were unable to commit to the time needed to
participate.
Mike Hughes added that one reason Children’s Hospital is on the list is
because they were participants in the EcoPass program and decided to drop
out. Now their staff is pushing them to get back into the program.

Director Francone noted that she had the opportunity to go on KLZ-560 AM Radio
with John Rush and Dan Meurer to discuss the University of Colorado A Line and
was able to get them to commit to a monthly segment to discuss transit. She said
that it will be a good opportunity for this agency to have a forum to push
information out to a more conservative audience and allow communications to get
the correct information to the public since there is a lot of miscommunication out
there. Also, as a result of the radio show, one of their producers has old RTD
passes from 1980 who would be happy to turn them over to the agency for
historical purposes.

General Manager Genova said he would be giving his usual report, except that, at
the time of the meeting, he would just be returning from Washington, D.C. He
would not be able to report on the approved length of the extension on the Federal
Railroad Authority’s waiver on the University of Colorado A-Line at that time but
would be able to say how the meeting went.

General Manager Genova said that Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Rail
Operations, would be following up with Director Deadwyler with further information
on one of the actions.
Director Francone discussed the cost of the pass program working group and asked
what would be done differently with the extant program than had been done in the
past. Chair Hoy clarified that the recommended action on the Board meeting agenda
was for the travel training program rather than the pass program.
Director Menten stated that Director Williams works for the Denver Regional
Mobility and Access Council (DRMAC). When Chair Hoy asked why she mentioned
Director Williams employer, Director Menten said that DRMAC was one of the
entities listed on the list of parties listed for the proposed pass program study
group. She said she did not think a conflict of interest existed but in the future she
wanted to be cognizant of contracts that may be affected by conflicts.
Director Francone asked whether Director Williams is a Director of DRMAC. Barbara
McManus said she believed that Director Williams is, though she is aware she may
have to abstain from voting.
Director Menten said that the only potential conflict she remembers in her time with
RTD was with Director Walker, who she said was always very cautious.
Chair Hoy mentioned Director James also had to abstain over issues in the past. He
said he would speak with Director Williams to understand her current position at
DRMAC.
General Manager Genova asked whether the Directors all sign an annual financial
disclosure form, and Barbara McManus confirmed that they do. General Manager
Genova mentioned the disclosure forms were recently distributed to the staff.

Chair Hoy made the motion to approve
moving the January 24th Board agenda
to the full Board.

The motion passed with 5 in favor (Hoy,
Francone, Deadwyler, Walker, Menten) and 0
opposed.

Other Matters
Director Deadwyler said that she did not understand why Director Archuleta had
abstained from voting at a recent meeting. She said that there had been discussions
in the past to change to bylaws to direct the Chair to ask a Director abstaining from
voting the person’s reasoning for the abstention, though she said nothing was done
at the time the discussion took place. Barbara McManus said that change had not
gone forward. General Manager Genova said it was determined under Robert’s
Rules of Order that a person does not have to give a reason for abstaining, and
Barbara McManus confirmed. Chair Hoy said that he recalled the bylaws had
changed to prevent people from being barred from abstaining. Director Deadwyler
said the reason for the change was to prevent Directors with a conflict of interest
from even participating in the conversation at hand, because in the past Director
James participated in discussions on a particular topic but later abstained from
voting on that topic.
Director Menten said she recalled a similar situation with Director Folska, and
Barbara McManus confirmed that the issue had to do with the naming rights for the
University of Colorado A-Line. Chair Hoy said that it is the responsibility of
Directors in conflict to abstaining from participating in discussion. General Manager
Genova said that in the past General Counsel Rolf Asphaug had said that the
Director could participate in the discussion and did not have to leave the room.
Director Walker confirmed that he had been in that situation in the past and was
permitted to stay but not vote on the matter in question.
Chair Hoy said that the Directors need to know what the ground rules are, namely
that people should not participate in the discussion, can stay in the room, and
should not be voting on something in which they have a conflict of interest. He said
it rests on the Director to know whether they have a conflict of interest since the
other Directors will not know about the conflict in advance.

Motion:

6.F

Director Menten said a Director in conflict should leave the room, because even a
look on a Director’s face can have influence.

Chair Hoy said that the decision of what to discuss offline is between the Directors
but that he does not think the person in conflict of interest should participate in the
committee discussion, which may lead to the Director influencing someone to vote.
Director Francone said the appropriate response could be to take the discussion
offline.
Chair Hoy said he did not know that doing so would be appropriate, though he said
that would be left to the Directors to decide.
Director Walker said that a person with a conflict or the perception of a conflict
should not have contact with anyone about that conflict. For example, he said that,
if there were an item that had to do with Xcel under discussion at a Board meeting,
he would not discuss that item with anyone at Xcel.
Chair Hoy agreed and said that otherwise Director Walker’s position on the Board
may be that of lobbyist.
Director Deadwyler said the conflict goes both ways in that it may be inappropriate
for a Director approach the person in conflict for more information.
Chair Hoy said that it is in the best interest of the Board to make the best decision
based on the information available and asked whether the Board had agreement on
the matter, to which Director Menten agreed and Director Francone mentioned
General Counsel Asphaug had sent out a related memo.
Director Francone said that General Counsel Asphaug had sent a memo about
abstentions. Director Deadwyler said General Counsel Asphaug’s memo stated that
Directors may vote on minutes of meetings they did not attend. She said there was
no reason for Director Archuleta’s abstention.

Director Francone said that someone intimately involved with a certain topic being
voted upon has some information that may be valuable to the discussion. She said
it is in the person’s best interest to vote one way or another. She further stated
that, if she knows that someone has a conflict of interest, she could have a
discussion with that person offline to get the information that the person could not
discuss in the open.

6.F

Chair Hoy said abstaining is not a great thing to do but is allowed.
Directors Menten and Deadwyler said they would have to read the abstention
memo again.

Director Anderson said the issue of abstention is a legal issue and a Colorado
statutory issue. She would object if she had knowledge of a certain thing that RTD
was talking about and tried to influence Board members by calling them and
discussing the issue with them. She said the law makes it so Directors cannot do
that.
Chair Hoy noted that Director Anderson was speaking to the issue of conflicts of
interest rather than just abstention.
Director Menten said the key words to consider in abstaining are “financial gain”.
She said she would call Director Archuleta and ask why he had abstained from
voting the previous week.
Chair Hoy reiterated that there were two separate issues being discussed: conflicts
of interest and abstention. He said the Board would not be opening up another
bylaw committee.
Chair Hoy called for any other items of discussion.
Director Menten mentioned the new Directors should know procedure for removing
a single item from the consent agenda. She further stated, in regard to the study of
the fare pass program, that she was in sticker shock over the pricing. She said that,
with the cost of the facilitator and the technical consultant, the cost for the
program was between $240,000 and $290,000. She said that figure was not at all
what she thought it would be and had assumed a cost of a mediator being between
$10,000 and $13,000 to do three to six meetings with the public and with internal
stakeholders. She did not anticipate the cost of the study being $250,000 or more.
Director Menten said she had a meeting scheduled with Michael Washington and
Bill Van Meter to discuss the study costs. She said that the project had experienced
quite a bit of mission creep, which is why it had become so costly, and hoped to
reduce the scope. She said the project does not deserve a $250,000 study.

General Manager Genova asked if Mr. Asphaug should put together some

agreed. Barbara McManus said that Mr. Asphaug would also be meeting with
Directors one-on-one.

6.F

Chair Hoy said he was unsure where he falls on the issue and needs more
information.

General Manager Genova said RTD went through the fare structure process in
2014-15 and that the Board voted on new fare rates that went into effect in 2016.
He said at the time the new rates went into effect there was a significant increase
in purchasing of EcoPasses. He said the main EcoPass stakeholders were initially
upset about RTD’s approach to EcoPass pricing. He stated that he felt the price
increase was valid and that RTD had landed in a good place with respect to the
new fare structures. With the financial report of the previous Friday, he mentioned
RTD was close to the yearly projected revenue when considering all the different
variables, specifically changing from three transit zones to two and issuing day
passes for the first time. He said there had been concerns based on fare modeling
and significant service plan shifts but that the estimates were playing out very well.
He said that, at the time the rate changes were being discussed, RTD committed to
putting together a working group to look over all of the types of passes issued,
namely Flex Passes, monthly passes, neighborhood passes, college passes, etc.
General Manager Genova stated the original intent of the study was to look at all of
the types of passes issued by RTD. He also said that, in the meantime, there have
been discussions about low-income passes and even further pass types. General
Manager Genova said that RTD committed to the stakeholders and a broad body of
elected officials to undertake this study in 2015 and that he has struggled to tell
these individuals that the study will not commence until 2017. He said the
stakeholders are frustrated, but with so much going on in 2016, they were told
they would have to wait until 2017.
He said that RTD has finally embarked on the process and needs assistance from
the facilitator given the diversity of individuals on the working group and the groups
being interviewed around the districts. He said that the invitations had already gone
out to the individuals in the study group listed in the previous week’s Board packet.
He said that, originally, the plan was to appoint two individuals per RTD district but
that model was changed because it did not seem to work and that it was decided
the group needed a broader base. General Manager Genova said that certain people
opted not to participate because they could not commit to the process.
He said that he questioned staff as to whether the study will be completed in a
year. He said that other groups may perform their own financial analyses and may

Director Francone agreed with Director Menten.

conclude that EcoPass is too pricey. He stated that the reason RTD has hired a
facilitator is to represent RTD, to do data analysis, to crunch numbers, and to look
at as many factors as possible to take a look at the process, the financial analysis,
the induced demand, etc. He said that it is valuable to do this process because he
receives requests almost weekly from very large entities who are looking at using
RTD passes and typically choose EcoPass because it is the cheapest option. He said
that EcoPass is set up for companies and other organizations but that RTD has a lot
of contracts with different types of groups. For example, he mentioned that the
Governor’s office called to say EcoPass is really expensive. He said that, when RTD
representatives spoke with the Governor’s representatives to walk them through
the options and showed them how reasonable the pricing really is, they renewed
their contract.
Director Menten asked how many people under the state contract actually live
within district.
General Manager Genova said that the EcoPass is only for the people who live in
district, which is part of the master contract with the state of Colorado. He said
that RTD has other contracts, such as one along the US 36 corridor, and that RTD
has so many different approaches to issuing EcoPasses that it is dangerous. He said
that Denver Public Schools (DPS) had just emailed him to talk about EcoPass for
DPS high school students and that the City of Lafayette had considered placing a
property tax increase on the ballot to do a city-wide EcoPass. He said that RTD had
responded to these inquiries and said there are not enough resources in the
organization to properly come up with the cost for such an endeavor. He said
Boulder County has done the same as the City of Lafayette and that DIA wants to
put all 35,000 employees on EcoPasses.
General Manager Genova said it would be great to have all these people on transit
but asked how one would price a pass that gets such wide distribution, because it
is unclear how much issuing so many passes would displace other forms of
payment and revenue. He said there is a high variability with the way RTD is
issuing EcoPasses and that it would be difficult to move backward if RTD
establishes a large program. He asked what would happen if a program were to
bring in 10,000 new users on EcoPass. He said so much of the proper analysis has
not even been identified, which is why RTD is contracting with a technical
consultant. He said that managing the process and keeping up expectations would
be long and arduous, which is why RTD had contracted with the facilitator,
considering the amount of facilitation, minutes taking, and prep for four-hour
meetings. He said his hope is to make some improvements to the EcoPass program
in the end and mentioned that all of the Directors were on the Board for the fare

adjustment process. He said the project is going to take a lot of resources and that
the board made the commitment to proceed. He said even the 1-year period is
aggressive.

General Manager Genova agreed and said, with the additional variables, this
process may be more complicated. He used the neighborhood EcoPass program as
an example, in one neighborhood someone might currently pay $50 while others
pay $12.
Chair Hoy stated that the end result may actually an increase in revenue.
General Manager Genova said that the Board approved the objectives of the study,
one of which is standardizing revenue. He said RTD will get requests for programs
that are not currently offered, such as community-wide EcoPasses and low-income
EcoPasses. He said the analysis will have to be done to determine what can and
cannot be done. He said that Heather Copp, RTD’s Chief Financial Officer, and
Michael Washington, Title VI Manager, are RTD’s representatives to the program,
because the two main issues are revenue and Title VI compliance.
Director Deadwyler stated the study may cost more than $250,000. She
speculated that, with all of the analysis needed, the total may run even higher.
General Manager Genova said the cost will be monitored very closely and that the
intention is to not go beyond that amount. He said that, at the very least, RTD may
come out of it with a better policy to respond to these questions about community
EcoPasses and the like. He reiterated that there is a high variability of how RTD has
done EcoPass in the past and that it would be good to put parameters around the
issuance of passes. He said that he is optimistic but that the process will be
challenging.
Director Menten asked how many of these groups want a reduced price and agreed
with Director Deadwyler in saying the study may exceed $250,000.
General Manager Genova said that the project has a defined budget and a timeline
of one year.
Chair Hoy said that he has friends in higher education who are reluctant to do
something for their students and wonders if something can be done to make the

Packet Pg. 49

Chair Hoy asked General Manager Genova to confirm that it is fair to say the pass
program adjustment is just as big a process as fare adjustment.

6.F

General Manager Genova said it would be nice to simplify the formulas and that
high schools have approached RTD wanting the same rates that colleges receive.
He said certain schools have not joined because they do not have the frequency or
level of services coming into the city center. He said that there is no policy for such
a program and that RTD receives tons of requests for pass programs for which
there is no policy. He said that people are frustrated that RTD is not being a good
partner.
Director Deadwyler said RTD is getting a lot of pressure from the schools though
they are looking for charity, such as free excursions. She asked how RTD should
handle those requests.
General Manager Genova said that RTD does not do excursions and that individuals
on Medicare, senior citizens, and students can purchase a 50% reduced fare, which
is what Denver Public Schools buy.
Director Deadwyler asked if DPS distributes those reduced-fare tickets to the
students.
General Manager Genova said yes, though he pointed out that even the schools
within DPS have differing methods of distributing the tickets.
Chair Hoy said that his wife works in the Adams 12 School District and that they
buy tickets for the district and distribute them to the individual schools, which may
have their own criteria. He said that many tickets go to students on the free and
reduced lunch program as one of the main distribution criteria.
Director Deadwyler said that schools constantly want RTD to give them more
tickets and that RTD sent out a letter about reduced fare criteria that went over the
heads of the schools.
General Manager Genova said that what the schools want is EcoPass pricing. He
said RTD receives requests from all around and that Denver’s mayor has asked
about EcoPass pricing, too. He reported that Denver uses something called a
MyDenver card and that, if the Mayor had his way, that card would be their transit
pass as well.

passes work for them. He said that hopefully some of the formulas can be
simplified.

6.F

Chair Hoy said he did not want to speak for everyone but felt that the Executive
Committee does not want to see the EcoPass becoming a free-and-reduced
program and that stating so might be a good message going forward.

Director Francone asked whether there has been any consideration, in the interest
of cost reduction, to partner with student groups or others to do the technical
evaluation.
General Manager Genova said anyone interested could respond to the RFP.
Director Walker said that giving the study over to students would result in studentquality work. He said that, in his field, a National Environmental Protection Act
evaluation for a small five-acre plot of land could cost $100,000. He said the
$250,000 price of the technical evaluation does not surprise him and that the oneyear timeline is aggressive. He further stated that transparency costs money and
that there will be value in whatever is developed, though the outcome may not be
what RTD wanted. Whatever the result, Director Walker said that RTD would be
able to back up any changes to the pass program, as was the case with the recent
changes in the code of conduct.
Director Deadwyler mentioned hiring a Chief Operations Officer. She questioned
whether a COO could not be hired for less than $200,000 and asked General
Manager Genova for a justification.
General Manager Genova said that a COO was being hired for a couple of reasons:
1) RTD has greatly expanded its operating base and has needed position like this for
years, because one person would be responsible for integrating bus, rail, and
Access-a-Ride operations, and 2) Certain pieces of the organization would be
elevated, namely Access-a-Ride and service planning. He said the reporting
structure of those two elements of the organization is very low and would now
report much higher. He said another piece is that he is more involved in the day-today business operations than he would like and suggested a COO would be able to
take that on.
Director Deadwyler said Phil Washington, RTD’s former General Manager, had
previously headed both Operations and FasTracks. She said she was not trying to
compare Mr. Washington to General Manager Genova, but she does not want the
organization to seem too top heavy.

Director Francone said there is no question that the pass program needs to be
revamped but the Board felt sticker shock the other night.

Director Deadwyler also wanted to comment on the structure of the Executive
Committee meetings. She asked whether both Barbara McManus and Mr. McKay
are part of the Executive Committee team. She inquired about the Board Office
structure in terms of their roles.

Barbara McManus said she was not always in the meetings in the past and that she
will not be reporting and will not speak unless spoken to.
Chair Hoy said Mr. McKay is just getting up to speed on how the Board operates
and did not see a problem with both of them sitting in on meetings. He mentioned
that he would be meeting with Board Office staff individually.
Director Deadwyler said she only wanted to bring up their involvement because she
does not remember having multiple Board Office staffers in the Executive
Committee meetings in the past.
Chair Hoy said the Executive Committee would see Barbara McManus and John
McKay side-by-side because John would not learn everything overnight.

Award of Access-a-Ride Service Contracts

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into contracts with MV Transportation,
Transdev, and Via Mobility Services for the provision of Access-a-Ride service using dedicated vehicles.
These contracts are for three years, with two one-year options for a total of 5-years, for a 5-year cost of
$175,341,294.00. In addition, RTD will reimburse the contractors’ direct fuel costs in an amount
estimated to be $20,715,915.00 for the total 5-year term. The total 5-year not-to-exceed amount for
Access-a-Ride dedicated-vehicle service and fuel is $196,057,209.00.
It is further recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into contracts with MV Transportation
and Transdev for the provision of Access-a-Ride service using non-dedicated (contractor provided)
vehicles. These contracts are for three years, with two one-year options for a total of 5-years, at a notto-exceed 5-year cost of $38,918,913.00. Fuel for the non-dedicated vehicle contracts is included in
the service contract price. These recommendations represent the most responsive and responsible
proposals received in response to Request for Proposals (RFP) 16-DH-047 (dedicated vehicle) and 16DH-046 (non-dedicated vehicle) to provide Access-a-Ride Service. The contracts to provide this service
are scheduled to be effective April 1, 2017.
BACKGROUND
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires that public entities operating a fixed route system
also provide paratransit service to individuals with disabilities which is comparable to the level of service
provided to individuals without disabilities. RTD adheres to the U.S. Department of Transportation, Part
37 regulations (Transportation for Individuals with Disabilities) which regulate paratransit services. All
policies regarding services were developed in concert with a citizen advisory committee comprised of
individuals from the disabled community. The original design of the Access-a-Ride program was adopted
by the RTD Board of Directors and was forwarded to the Federal Transportation Administration for their
approval.
The current Access-a-Ride structure consists of one Call Center contractor, First Transit, one eligibility
certification contractor, Easter Seals of Colorado, three Service Provider contractors using RTD owned
vehicles and one Service Provider contractor using contractor-owned vehicles. The service providers
using RTD-owned “dedicated” vehicles are All Aboard Transit Services, MV Transportation, and Via
Mobility. The Service Provider using contractor-owned “non-dedicated” vehicles is Transdev. During
the course of the current contract, the service providers faced serious challenges in recruiting and
retaining operators. The Denver region is experiencing driver recruitment difficulties. Colorado has a
thriving economy and a very low unemployment rate, which means job applicants have many options.
The biggest challenge has been that many local organizations pay drivers higher rates than our current
service providers can afford. In addition to salary competition, the legalization of recreational marijuana
has introduced new challenges. Many otherwise qualified applicants and some employees are failing

Packet Pg. 53

11.A

their drug screening tests or choosing jobs where marijuana use doesn’t matter. As a result of these
significant factors, Access-a-Ride has been experiencing unprecedented challenges in meeting the needs
of our passengers. On a daily basis, staff struggles to have enough capacity to meet the ongoing
growth of the program. In order to mitigate current circumstances, staff elected not to extend the
option years (year four (4) and five (5)) in the current contracts and instead, issue new RFP’s in order to
offer proposers an opportunity to reevaluate current wages and to make adjustments accordingly.
On November 9, 2016, RTD issued two Requests for Proposals (RFP) soliciting technical and price
proposals to provide Access-a-Ride services. One RFP gave proposers the option of bidding on 40% or
20% of the service using RTD-owned vehicles. The second RFP gave proposers the option of bidding on
5%, 10%, or 15% of Access-a-Ride service using contractor-owned vehicles. These services represent
the re-bid of service currently provided by All Aboard Transit Services, MV Transportation, Via Mobility,
and Transdev. The two RFPs were available on the RTD external website for public download. In
addition, announcements were placed in transit publications. Proposals were due on December 15,
2016.

DISCUSSION
Five (5) proposals were received in response to RFP 16-DH-047 for the Provision of Access-a-Ride
services using RTD-owned “dedicated” vehicles. Proposals were received from All Aboard Transit
Services, MV Transportation, Total Transportation Corp, Transdev, and Via Mobility Services. In
addition, five (5) proposals were received in response to RFP 16-DH-046 for the provision of Access-aRide services using contractor-owned “non-dedicated” vehicles. Proposals were received from Metro
Taxi, MV Transportation, Transdev, Union Taxi, and Velocity.
It is the recommendation of the evaluation committee formed to evaluate proposals received in response
to RFP 16-DH-047, that RTD award contracts for the Access-a-Ride “dedicated-vehicle” service
provision to MV Transportation, Transdev and Via Mobility Services. This recommendation is based upon
the evaluation of the proposals according to the evaluative criteria as set forth in the RFP for this
procurement. The evaluative criteria established for this procurement were: a) understanding/approach
and organization for implementation (40%); b) experience of firm and individuals proposed for key
positions and disciplines (25%); c) Small Business Enterprise (SBE) Submittal / Compliance (5%) and d)
price (30%). In addition, it is the recommendation of the evaluation committee formed to evaluate
proposals received in response to RFP 16-DH-046, that RTD award contracts for the Access-a-Ride
“non-dedicated-vehicle” service provision to MV Transportation and Transdev. This recommendation is
based upon the same evaluation criteria as discussed above.
The evaluation team consisted of Carolyn Conover, Senior Manager, Contracted Services; Larry Buter,
Manager, Paratransit Services; Brian Matthews, Manager, Special Services; Chris Sills, Paratransit Safety
and Training Compliance Officer; Joy Volz, Paratransit Quality Assurance Supervisor and Eric Castillo,
Quality Control Inspector.
Each team member evaluated the proposals on how well the proposal met the evaluative criteria set
forth for the procurement and assigned a score for “Understanding and Approach” and for “Experience
and Proposed Key Positions.” SBE Submittal and Compliance was evaluated and scored by Amanda
Becker, SBO Compliance Officer. The score for the “Cost” element of each proposal was calculated by
the RTD procurement staff and was then added to the technical score of each proposal to determine the
overall score or rating of each proposal.

A comparison of the proposed costs was made using the lowest scores for the dedicated-vehicle 40%
and 20% and the non-dedicated vehicle 15%, 10%, and 5% service levels. The service model deemed
most advantageous to the District in terms of both quality and cost resulted in a combination of one
40% dedicated-vehicle provider (MV Transportation) two 20% dedicated vehicle providers (Transdev and
Via Mobility Services) and two 10% non-dedicated vehicle service providers (MV Transportation and
Transdev). It was the consensus of the evaluation team that these firms presented the best proposals in

Packet Pg. 56

11.A

terms of the understanding of the project, proposed management team, proposed organization, approach
to deliver the requested service, attainment of SBE goals and proposed price.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The recommended action is based upon the evaluation committee’s determination that the recommended
firm’s proposals represent the most responsive and responsible proposals received in response to the
RFP issued by the District. This determination is based upon the evaluation of technical and price
components consistent with the evaluative criteria established by RTD and communicated in the RFP
document.
An RTD internal financial analysis indicated that the estimated cost to provide these services would be
lower than the prices offered by the recommended service providers. The estimated cost was based on
projected wage rates and other operating expenses which were lower than those presented in each
proposal evaluated. As supported by the current labor market analyses that were included in the
dedicated-vehicle proposals, staff believes that the starting operator wages offered by each proposer will
give the contractors a much-needed ability to recruit and retain operators and thus address a major issue
facing all service providers in the Denver metro area. As discussed earlier, RTD as well as our
contractors have faced the same challenges with recruiting and retaining qualified operators. The
proposed starting wage will offer our providers the opportunity to make significant improvements which
will result in improved service for our passengers.
A portion of the funds needed for the provision of the first year of service under this contract are
included in the 2017 approved budget. However, due to the increased costs of the proposals, additional
funding may be requested during the Amended Budget process to ensure funding will be adequate to
provide Access-a-Ride service through the end of 2017. Funds will be requested in future budgets for
the provision of service in future years.
ALTERNATIVES:
1)
2)

3)

Award contracts to MV Transportation, Transdev, and Via Mobility as recommended.
Maintain existing contracts by exercising options. This is not recommended as it does not
address the issues currently facing the Access-a-ride program. This would severely limit
the ability of RTD to provide Access-a-Ride service.
Resolicit the RFP. This is not recommended as the proposal process has resulted in a
responsive and responsible proposal and will provide a realistic wage for Access-a-Ride
operators to address current challenges in providing Access-a-Ride service.

Access-a-Ride Travel Training Project

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to enter into a contract with Via Mobility Services for
the provision of Travel Training services. Performance under the contract is for a one (1) year period
and shall not exceed $134,040.
BACKGROUND
As a former recipient of New Freedom Funds allocated to RTD for a variety of projects, the Bus
Operations Department, specifically, Contracted Services, endeavored to collaborate with an existing
contractor for the purpose of creating a Travel Training Program. The program, designed to travel train
individuals with disabilities, was to be a catalyst for motivating individuals to use fixed route services in
lieu of its paratransit counterpart, Access-a-Ride. The existing contractor selected was Via Mobility
Services. Via, an established paratransit provider and nationally recognized as a travel training pioneer
was asked to provide travel training services during an experimental phase in order to assess travel
training as a feasible service offered by the District.
Via focused their attention on any Access-a-Ride eligible passenger and sought the assistance from our
Eligibility provider, Easter Seals of Colorado, in order to identify travel training candidates during the
initial phase of the eligibility assessment process. The combined efforts resulted in a positive return and
Via was able to average 5-8 trainings per month. During 2016, the New Freedom Funds were no longer
made available to RTD, thereby necessitating the release of a new RFP for services. The duration of this
contract is for a one (1) year term. During this time, staff will work with the ADA Paratransit Advisory
Committee (APAC) as well as members of the DRMAC Transit and Accessibility Task Force (TATF) in
order to modify the approach of travel training. In the subsequent RFP for travel training, trainees will be
trained to use fixed route so that Access-a-Ride can incorporate fixed route when scheduling paratransit
service. As an example of how future trips can be scheduled, when applicable, Access-a-Ride can pick
up a passenger at their home, transport them to a Park-n-Ride where the individual will transfer to a
regular bus and at the tail end of that ride, Access-a-Ride will meet them in order to transport them to
their final destination.
Members of both APAC and DRMAC TATF have agreed to offer
recommendations for this new design and serve as test participants during the trial phase. The one-year
term of this recommended contract award will allow RTD staff time to fully analyze and develop the
Scope of Work for the modified travel training and will allow individuals to continue to received travel
training services through 2017.
DISCUSSION
On November 17, 2016, an RFP was issued by RTD and two responses were received in response to
the RFP for travel training services. The Proposers were First Transit and Via Mobility Services.
The first step in the evaluation process was to review each Proposer’s qualifications, which included
understanding/approach and organization for implementation, experience and qualifications, and cost.
The second step was a comparison of bids from those vendors deemed to meet the minimum

Packet Pg. 59

11.B

qualifications of the RFP. First Transit fell short of meeting expectations by not being able to identify
the local staff that would be responsible for the day to day operations or an operating facility.
Overall, both proposals were similar with regards to the scope of services. The total cost for year 1
from First Transit was $295,127.64 as compared to $134,040 from Via. Staff recommends
awarding the travel training contract to Via Mobility Services. The not-to-exceed contract cost for
one year is $134,040.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for 2017 are currently available in the adopted 2017 RTD budget.
