BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
2024-25 Strategic Initiatives

September 16, 2024

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Debra A. Johnson, General Manager/CEO
John McKay, Executive Business Partner
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD’s 2021-2026 Strategic Plan (Strategic Plan) was approved by the Board during a Special Board
Meeting held on Tuesday, August 10, 2021.
The Strategic Plan establishes the agency’s four Strategic Priorities, which serve as the functional pillars
used to plan, develop, evaluate, and measure the agency’s overall performance:
Community Value: RTD strives to be a strong community partner, providing value to customers
as well as to the broader Denver metro region while sustaining planet Earth
Customer Excellence: RTD strives to consistently deliver high-quality customer service
Employee Ownership: RTD seeks to attract and retain a highly skilled and engaged workforce
Financial Success: RTD takes very seriously the management of all financial resources
Each Strategic Priority is associated with a measurable Success Outcome.
Leveraging data garnered through Community Value, Customer Excellence, and Employee Ownership
surveys, staff held strategy sessions in late 2022 and throughout 2023 to develop tactics to improve
agency performance in specific areas. These tactics were distilled into three overarching Strategic
Initiatives for 2023 and 2024, Back to Basics, People Power, and Welcoming Transit Environment.
For the performance period commencing September 1, 2023, and concluding June 30, 2024, each nonrepresented employee was required to develop and strive to achieve “stretch” goals developed using the
SMART framework and based on the Strategic Initiatives.
These goals were intentionally designed to drive and incentivize individual performance, which in turn
improves the performance of the agency overall. Moreover, the initiatives reflect a renewed collective
focus to deliver meaningful progress toward achieving the Success Outcomes.

1.C.1

On Thursday, August 8, 2024, staff engaged in a strategic planning workshop to assess progress
related to the 2023-24 Strategic Initiatives, review 2023 and 2024 survey responses and related key
drivers, and identify opportunity areas with respect to agency performance. The General Manager and
CEO and members of the Leadership Team met on Wednesday, August 14, 2024, to review workshop
outcomes and develop new Strategic Initiatives and tactics for the 2024-25 performance cycle.
DISCUSSION
Continuing to refine Strategic Initiatives and focusing staff efforts to drive agency progress directly
aligns with the tenets of the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan.
Staff has developed a new Strategic Initiative, Customer and Community Connections, for the 2024-25
performance cycle. The initiatives for the performance cycle are defined as:
Back to Basics: RTD strives to redouble agency efforts to maintain assets in a state of good repair
leveraging sound asset management principles.
People Power: Recognizing the critical importance of its people, the agency’s most important
resource, in achieving the agency’s mission, RTD seeks to vigorously address impediments to
recruitment and retention efforts and to foster a culture of learning and development.
Welcoming Transit Environment: RTD seeks to reduce the impacts of criminal behaviors and Code
of Conduct violations on agency services and workplaces and, in doing so, to improve community
and employee perception of personal and public security on RTD property and vehicles.
Customer and Community Connections (NEW): RTD is committed to fostering community building
and enriching the customer experience.
Based on the outcomes of the August 2024 strategic planning workshop and the subsequent work of
the GM/CEO and members of the Leadership Team, staff has continued to develop an Annual Scorecard
related to agency performance driven by an operational vantage point. The scorecard captures the 202425 Strategic Initiatives and tactics, along with leading indicators designed to focus efforts to improve
outcomes related to the Strategic Plan.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no direct financial impact associated with the 2024-25 Strategic Initiatives or the associated
Annual Scorecard.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Financial Success Performance Metrics

September 16, 2024

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Debra A. Johnson, General Manager and CEO
John McKay, Executive Business Partner
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD’s 2021-2026 Strategic Plan (Strategic Plan) was approved by the Board during a Special Board
Meeting held on Tuesday, August 10, 2021.
The Strategic Plan establishes the agency’s four Strategic Priorities, which serve as the functional pillars
used to plan, develop, evaluate, and measure the agency’s overall performance:
Community Value: RTD strives to be a strong community partner, providing value to customers
as well as to the broader Denver metro region while sustaining planet Earth
Customer Excellence: RTD strives to consistently deliver high-quality customer service
Employee Ownership: RTD seeks to attract and retain a highly skilled and engaged workforce
Financial Success: RTD takes very seriously the management of all financial resources
Each Strategic Priority is associated with a measurable Success Outcome.
During the Board’s annual retreat in 2024, Board members discussed opportunities to enhance agency
transparency and bolster communication and engagement with jurisdictional partners, stakeholders, and
customers. At that time, Board members collectively discussed the development of a series of openended questions intended to probe whether the agency is meeting its performance goals.
In alignment with this effort, staff developed a public-facing agency performance dashboard
(performance dashboard), which launched in May 2024. The performance dashboard provides answers
to these questions and serve as an easily accessible repository for performance data related to the
Strategic Plan. The performance dashboard will also be expanded over time to house information related
to the agency budget and financial reports, people power statistics, and other key measurements. The
performance dashboard enhances agency transparency and supports the Performance Committee’s
efforts to assess the agency’s progress toward Strategic Plan Success Outcomes.
Further, staff has developed a separate annual scorecard related to agency performance driven by an
operational vantage point. Related to this scorecard, staff has developed tactics and leading indicators

Packet Pg. 31

1.C.2

that stem from strategic initiatives related to agency performance. Staff anticipates presenting revisions
to the Strategic Initiatives for the 2024-25 performance cycle, and the corresponding annual scorecard,
to the Performance Committee in a separate Discussion Item during the committee’s meeting scheduled
for Monday, September 16, 2024.
DISCUSSION
As noted in the Strategic Plan document, and as contemplated by the Board and staff in 2021,
performance metrics are subject to change during the duration of the Plan. Adjusting agency metrics,
and thereby adjusting agency operations and performance, in order to achieve success outcomes is an
essential element of the Strategic Plan.
During the Performance Committee meeting on Monday, September 16, 2024, staff will discuss
potential performance metrics related to the Strategic Priority of Financial Success, including:
Financial Trust Index: A weighted composite index measuring financial trust, calculated as
follows:
o Percentage of compliance with the nine ratios utilized by the Office of the State Auditor in
assessing financial health (50% of weighting):
Cash to Liabilities
Working Capital
Asset Sufficiency
Unrestricted Net Position
Net Position
Debt Burden
Principal Payments to Total Outstanding Debt
Tax Revenue per Capita
Expenses per Capita
o Standard and Poor’s bond rating (20% of weighting)
o Average of Community Survey responses related to trust in financial management,
specifically in relation to the following prompts (30% of weighting):
RTD manages its financial resources well
RTD is a good financial steward of public funds
The community's investment in transit provides value
RTD's financial reporting is understandable and transparent
Budget Variability: % deviation from adopted budget
Cost per Revenue Hour: Inflation-adjusted operating cost per revenue hour
Debt Service Coverage: 1.2x coverage maintained
Monthly Reserves: Three months' operating reserves maintained
Fare Value: Percentage of customers who agree or strongly agree that fares are reasonable, as
measured by annual Customer Excellence surveys
Staff will then incorporate the metrics into the Agency Performance Scorecard for later consideration by
the Performance Committee and the full Board.
