Special Board Meeting
VINCE BUZEK: Great. I will now call the Tuesday March 8, 2022 Special Board Meeting to order. We are
convened as of 5:31 PM Mountain Standard Time. I would respectfully ask everyone to remain muted
unless you are recognized to speak. Thank you all for joining us this evening. Please note that the official
meetings of the RTD Board of Directors are being held remotely in the interest of public health, safety,
and welfare.
The official meetings of the Board of Directors will be held via Zoom and will be audio and video recorded.
Pardon me, I have a cold, also. So I stop to cough, I apologize. The meeting recordings, along with the
unofficial minutes of the meetings, will be posted as soon as practicable on the Board's website. Visit rtddenver.com. And a live stream of this meeting is also available via RTD's YouTube page.
Colleagues, being elected as a member of this body imposes an ethical obligation for each of us to
enhance and maintain the public confidence in this agency. As a Board of Directors, it is our collective
duty to our constituents, stakeholders, and staff to conduct our business in an atmosphere of mutual
respect, cooperation, civility, trust, and collegiality. These are the values we can all agree upon.
As such, I encourage each of us to review the operating guidelines adopted by this Board and to act in
accordance with those principles, which are available on the Board of Directors page on the RTD website.
Thank you. I guess-- is Miss McManus here? Can you call the roll, or should I?

Jillian or Tai-Shrae, were any email comments received for tonight's meeting?

VINCE BUZEK: OK, thanks very much. We'll move on. If you wish to speak and have not already done
so, please raise your virtual hand or press star 9 on your phone. Staff will unmute you when it is your turn
to speak. If you are dialed in, press star 6 to toggle your mute settings.
Please bear in mind that by participating in this process, you are being recorded. If you do not wish to be

their remarks by stating their names, and each speaker will have three minutes to speak.
Speakers, please refrain from profane or obscene speech. Direct your comments to the Board as a whole
and refrain from personal attacks. Do we have any speakers?
JILLIAN KNAPP-RHODES: We do not have any at this time.
VINCE BUZEK: Thanks, Jillian. No one has signed up. With no participants in the queue, we'll close the
public participation period at this time. There's one recommended action on the agenda tonight, listed as
item Roman IV, action A and the action is for the Board of Directors to adopt the Director District map
identified as alternative E, as in Edward, revised in accordance with the following discussion and as
recommended by Chair Buzek and Directors Broom and Sloan.
The adoption of this action will support the agency's strategic priorities of community value and customer
excellence. Do I have a motion?
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
KATE WILLIAMS: So moved, Director Williams.
VINCE BUZEK: I have Williams, and a second by Rivera-Malpiede.
JULIEN BOUQUET: Chairman, you're muted.
KATE WILLIAMS: Or your volume went away.
DOUG TISDALE: Mr. Chairman, you are muted.
VINCE BUZEK: I'm going to start the meeting over. We had a motion and a second, a motion by Director
Williams and a second by Director Rivera-Malpiede. I would ask General Manager Johnson or Bill Van
Meter, Assistant General Manager Planning, to present any pertinent information regarding this action to
the Board.

WILLIAM VAN METER: Thank you, Chair. This is Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager of Planning.
And Chris Quinn, our project Manager for this redistricting action item is also in attendance as a support.
Just a very brief note, we had a very smooth, robust, and open process for this regular state required,
legislatively required decennial redistricting to assure even representation among the 15 Board Member
districts. We appreciate the support and leadership from Directors Broom and Sloan as the committee.
We had a number of public meetings and public hearings, reported that input. And we're able to arrive at
what I believe is a very solid recommendation. And the final note that I would add is that the reason for
this special meeting, as noted in the Board report and as the Board has heard before, is because the
deadline for Board approval with a 2/3 super majority is March 15 of this year.
And so it's been a solid process. And I appreciate the support and interest and look forward to your
action.
VINCE BUZEK: Thanks very much for that. And I thank you and your team for your support and work on
this, and thank all the Board members also who participated. Is there any discussion? Director Lewis.
SHONTEL LEWIS: I really appreciate this process. And I appreciate the opportunity to bring community
into the discussion. And I just want to say for the sake of the record, that I will miss my 5 points people.
And there is no way, shape, or form that this is associated with you all and my opportunity or ability to
lead you. But this being the map that I believe best represents the entire region and more specifically
allows that district to have representation as well. So just want to say that for the sake of the record and
for my constituents.
VINCE BUZEK: Thank you for those comments. Director Williams.
KATE WILLIAMS: Director Lewis, you can come hang out with me down there any time you want. We
would love to have you.
SHONTEL LEWIS: I still do. I was just at Welton Street Cafe. So we're good.
VINCE BUZEK: Don't come north. OK, any other comments. Seeing none. Are there any Directors
opposed? Seeing no Directors in opposition. We will declare this unanimous of the Board members
present with 14 I votes, 0 No votes and one Director absent.
OK, we're going to move on to other matters. Are there any other matters to come before the Board?
Great. In a moment the Directors are going to meet in executive session. So I'm going to ask for a motion
to move into Executive session pursuant to 24-6-402(4)b Colorado Revised Statutes to receive legal
advice and section 24-6-402(4)e, Colorado Revised Statutes for determining positions relative to matters
that may be subject to negotiations regarding the successor collective bargaining agreement with the
Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1001. Do I have a motion?
DOUG TISDALE: Tisdale, so moved.

VINCE BUZEK: Tisdale. Who was a second?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Rivera-Malpiede.
BOB BROOM: Broom.
VINCE BUZEK: Broom, I got you, Bob. Sorry, Angie. Director Catlin, I see your hand raised. Do you have
a discussion?
PEGGY CATLIN: I am not able to access the link. And so I have asked General Council Snyder to resend
it. So if we could just take a few moments to make sure that we all are able to access the meeting, I'd
sure appreciate it. Thank you.
VINCE BUZEK: We'll wait for you on the other side. Is there any discussion on the motion? Are there any
Directors in opposition to the motion to move an Executive Session? Seeing none. That passes 14 to 0
with one Director absent.
Everybody that is now entitled to participate in the Executive Session. Let's come back. Are we going to
return back here? Yeah, I think, we're going to come back to this meeting after our Executive Session and
then adjourn and go into our committee meeting. So let's head out of here and go into the Executive
Session.
