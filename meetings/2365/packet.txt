BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, Interim General Manager and
CEO

Date: October 14, 2015

From:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

October 13, 2015

Board Meeting Date: October 27, 2015

Subject:

January 2016 Service Plan

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the January 2016 Service Change package as revised and summarized in Attachment A
resulting in an annualized cost of approximately $870,350 and, further, to authorize the General
Manager or his designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose
service is impacted by these changes.
DISCUSSION
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. We will continue adjusting services in
response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. It is also
our responsibility to identify services that are underperforming and recommend modifications,
curtailment or cancellation of service as warranted. The proposals herein include a mix of service
enhancements, adjustments to schedules and several service reductions. These proposals are offered in
parallel with the Board approved US 36 BRT Service Plan and would be implemented on the same date.
We will monitor customer response to the implementation of these service changes and propose
adjustments as appropriate in future service change recommendation.
The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
 Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
 Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
SUMMARY OF PUBLIC HEARINGS
Three public hearings were held during the public comment period, which extended between October
16th and October 19th. Comments from these meetings and the service change website are summarized
in Attachment B of this report.
CHANGES TO INITIAL RECOMMENDATIONS
Staff receives input during the public comment process and continues to conduct additional analysis
after the initial service recommendations are communicated to the Board of Directors. Depending on the
outcome of the public comment process and continued analysis, staff may or may not propose
modifications to these initial recommendations. The following represent substantive changes proposed to

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The total base system financial impact contained in this proposal is estimated to be $870,350
annualized. An estimated $139,750 of the total cost impact is grant funded and sponsored by Boulder
County. Net Cost $730,600.
EQUITY ANALYSIS
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and
Executive Order 12898 regarding Environmental Justice. In this circular, the FTA requires RTD to
evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that exceed the established major service
change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a disproportionately negative impact on
minority or low-income populations. Our evaluation of the proposed January 2016 service changes does
not reveal any disparities in impacts absorbed by minority or low-income populations.

A LOOK AHEAD – Spring 2016
The following items are service concepts currently under consideration or are planned events that impact
operations in the next service change period:
 A and R Lines Rail and Bus Service Plan (East and I-225 Corridor)
 Grant funded peak period service increase on the Free MetroRide

Packet Pg. 6

Route 3 – Alameda Avenue
This proposal discontinues the deviation into the Havana & Alameda Park-n-Ride.
Passengers may instead use stops on Alameda, approximately 300 feet away. Saves 3-4
minutes in each direction for through passengers. It is also proposed to provide more direct
routing through Cherry Creek by operating on Adams Street instead of Madison Street
between Bayaud Avenue and Ellsworth, instead of the indirect routing via Ellsworth,
Madison, and Bayaud. This routing provides convenient access for neighborhood
residents, as well as more direct and faster service for through passengers. No cost
impacts are anticipated.
Route 3L – East Alameda Limited
Schedule adjustments. No cost impacts are anticipated
Route 8 – North Broadway/Huron
It is proposed to extend this route to 144th and Huron at 60 min frequency, all day in
order to provide fixed route service to the Orchards Mall development. In addition, it is
proposed to remove the current ‘selected trips’ from the 124thand Peoria loop and to
operate all trips after Wagon Road Park-n-Ride on Huron. Trips would no longer enter the
Park-n-Ride, but provide connections on-street at Huron and 120th Avenue. Cost impacts
anticipated to be an estimated $165,000 annualized.
Route 10- 12th Avenue
It is proposed to reroute eastbound trips to operate on Wazee Street between 15th and
17th streets, and on 17th Street between Wazee and Market streets. Service would be
discontinued on Wazee Street west of 15th Street, on 14th Street and Market Street. No
cost impacts are anticipated with this proposal.
Route 11 – Mississippi Avenue
Discontinue deviation via Cherry Street and Cherry Creek Drive South, north of Mississippi
in Glendale. Most passengers boardings are within 500 feet of Mississippi, others may
use Route 46. Saves approximately 3 minutes in each direction for through passengers.
Reroute via Blackhawk Street instead of Abilene between Mississippi and Exposition
Avenues in Aurora. More conveniently serves the overall residential and commercial
development in this area.
Route 15 – East Colfax
New recovery location at 11th/Larimer requires revision to the exit from the Auraria
Campus. New routing will be 11th Street, R-Auraria Pkwy, C-Market St, R-17th St, to
regular route. No cost impacts are anticipated.
Route 16 – West Colfax
It is proposed to discontinue evening and late night short-turn trips between Civic Center
Station and Decatur-Federal Station. Anticipated cost savings is estimated to be $63,000
annualized.
Route 20 – 20th Avenue

Reroute Route 28 onto 26th Avenue between Lowell Blvd and Clay St. Reroute Route 28B
to remain on 26th Avenue between Quitman St and Lowell Blvd. Route 28B to continue
service on Lowell Blvd and 29th Ave. Minor schedule adjustments are proposed.
No cost impacts are anticipated.
Route 31 – Federal Boulevard & Route 30 – South Federal
To improve on time performance on weekends, it is proposed to add an additional bus to
the cycle on both Saturday and Sunday. Minor schedule adjustments are also proposed for
weekday. Anticipated cost is $44,000 annualized.
Route 31L – North Federal Limited (formerly the Route 31X)
Schedules adjustments are proposed to improve connections at Denver Union Station. No
cost impacts are anticipated.
Route 32 – 32nd Avenue
Extend Saturday/Sunday/holiday service from downtown Denver, east to Colorado Blvd.
with new recovery location facing westbound at 22nd Ave./Colorado. Reestablishes
weekend service to the Denver Zoo. No cost impacts are anticipated, due to using present
recovery time at Civic Center Station.
Route 33 – Platte Valley
Minor schedule adjustments are proposed. No cost impacts are anticipated.
Route 38 – 38th Avenue
Minor schedules adjustments are proposed. No cost impacts are anticipated.
Route 44 – 44th Avenue

Packet Pg. 8

Attachment: Atch A January 2016 Service Change revised (2550 : January 2016 Service Plan)

Route 21 – Evans Avenue
Late evening schedule adjustments for recovery distribution. No cost impacts are
anticipated.

The following changes are designed to extend the period of 15 minute frequency along
Leetsdale and through Cherry Creek by one hour at the end of the AM peak, and by one
hour eastbound at the beginning of the PM peak.
- Convert existing westbound Route 83L trip at 8:39am to a Route 83D (79L) trip.
- Add late AM peak westbound trips from Nine Mile Station at 9:09am and 9:39am.
- Add new midafternoon eastbound trips from Civic Center Station at 1:16pm and
1:46pm.
With these additions the 15 minute trunk frequency on Leetsdale/1st/Speer would then
operate until 10:45am westbound arriving Civic Center Station, and would begin at
1:00pm eastbound departing Civic Center Station. Current Route 83L midday productivity
is 65.0 boardings/hour. .
On Saturdays during the period of 15 minute frequency on Route 83L, approximately
10:00am to 6:00pm, reroute one trip per hour as Route 83D, providing Saturday service
along South Quebec Way and South Dayton. Cost impacts are anticipated to be an
estimated $60,000 annualized.
Route 83L – Parker/Leetsdale
Add 7:40am westbound trip on Saturday/Sunday/holidays, relieving overloads on existing
7:25am westbound trip. Cost impacts are anticipated to be an estimated $6,000
annualized.
Route 92 – 92nd Ave Crosstown
Schedule adjustments to improve on-time performance. No cost impacts are anticipated.
Route 100 – Kipling Street
Weekday minor schedule adjustments are proposed to improve on-time performance. No
cost impacts are anticipated.
Route 104X – Commerce City/Denver Express
Grant funding for this route expires as of January 16, 2016. It is proposed to incorporate
this route into the regular RTD services since ridership warrants its continuation, as per
RTD Service Standards. Hourly ridership for this service averages 24 passengers per inservice hour. However, the last trip in the northbound direction averages 5 passengers per
trip and so it is recommended that this trip be discontinued. Cost impacts are estimated to
be $140,700 annualized.
Route 120 – 120th Avenue/Brighton
This proposal extends the 7:05am westbound from Wagon Road pnR trip further east to
Prairie Center Parkway/27th Avenue to balance passenger loads between existing
westbound trips. Cost impacts are estimated to be $10,400 annualized.
Route120X Thornton/Wagon Road Express
It is proposed to add one southbound morning peak trip from Wagon Road pnR to Denver
Union Station at 8:35am Cost impact is estimated to be $8,200.

Schedule adjustments are proposed. No cost impacts are anticipated.
Route 205 - 28th Street /Gunbarrel/Heatherwood
Schedule adjustments are proposed. No cost impacts are anticipated.
Route 206 – Pearl/ Manhattan/Fairview High School
Discontinue the route segment between Boulder Junction at Depot Square (BJDS) and
Boulder Transit Center due to low ridership averaging 8 passengers per service hour or
1.5 passengers per trip and duplicative service provided by Routes 205 and HOP.
Increase the frequency between BJDS and Flatiron Business Park to 15 minutes in the
peaks with a timed connection with Route BJCC. Boulder Junction at Depot Square will
be the new western terminal for this route. This is part of the recently revised Boulder
Transportation Master Plan. No cost impacts are anticipated.
Route 225 – Boulder/Broomfield via Baseline & US 287
Schedule adjustments are proposed. No cost impacts are anticipated.
Route 323 – Skyline Crosstown
Due to the reconstruction and re-opening of Twin Peaks Mall, it is proposed to adjust
Route 323 to serve the location along Hover, between Nelson Rd and Diagonal Highway
119, similar to its former routing. This would result in the discontinuation of routing along
Diagonal Highway 119 between Hover and Nelson Rd, as well as along Nelson Rd
between Diagonal Highway 119 and Hover. This re-route comes at the request of the City
of Longmont in order for the route to better serve the reconstructed Mall directly. Average
daily Ridership affected: 26 passenger or 2 passengers per trip. No cost impacts are
anticipated.
Route AB – Boulder/Denver Airport (DIA)
Add one AM eastbound trip at 5:30am to address current overloads. Anticipated cost is
estimated to be $23,000 annualized.
Route BOLT – Boulder/Longmont
It is proposed to discontinue the Monarch Business Park loop due to ridership averaging 56 boardings per day, or 0.75 boardings per trip serving this location. No cost savings

realized, due to current buy up agreement; saved running time on Monarch Loop will allow
for better on-time performance and balanced layover/recovery.

Route GS – Golden/Boulder
Schedule adjustments are proposed. No cost impacts are anticipated.
Route J – Longmont/Gunbarrel/Boulder
It is proposed to discontinue route J south of Euclid/18th Street due to ridership on this
segment of the route averaging 15 boardings per day and duplication of local service via
Routes DASH, SKIP and 204. It is also proposed to discontinue the current 6:03pm
northbound trip due to ridership averaging only 9 passengers. Cost savings are estimated
to be $11,000 annualized.
Route L – Longmont/Denver
Boulder County and City of Longmont have been awarded grant funding for additional
weekday mid-day service, as well as Saturday service and new Sunday/Holiday service. It
is proposed to increase the weekday mid-day service to hourly frequency and extend the
service span to 10pm, northbound. In addition, Saturday hourly service frequency span is
proposed to be extended from approximately 9am to 10pm and Sunday hourly service
frequency to be added from 9am to 10pm, matching Saturday service levels and
frequency. The anticipated cost impact is $140,000 annualized funded through a CMAQ
grant sponsored by Boulder County.
Route N – Nederland Boulder
Schedule adjustments are proposed. No cost impacts are anticipated.

Light Rail
E Line
It is proposed to add one train in the operations (total of seven trains) to complete the transition
to a full 15-minute headway in the AM and PM peak periods. Southbound trips from Denver
Union Station would be added at 6:58 AM, 8:13 AM, 3:58 PM, 5:28 PM, and 5:58 PM.
Northbound trips from Lincoln Station would be added at 6:24 AM, 7:54 AM, 3:39 PM, and 4:39
PM. This increase in service will help with transfers to/from the new Flatiron Flyer and new
commuter rail lines opening later in the year in addition to transfers to/from existing routes such
as the W Line. Additionally, it helps increase capacity on RTD’s fastest-growing light rail line
(11% ridership increase between 2013-2014) and provides an alternative service to the F Line
and H Line, the latter which is near capacity during the peak hour. Additionally, it is proposed to

Route DASH – Boulder/Lafayette Via Louisville
This proposal discontinues the Sunday interline to the Route JUMP in an effort to improve
on-time performance. Cost impacts anticipated to be $39,000 annualized.

1.B.1.a

W Line
It is proposed to adjust times slightly to space trains better at Denver Union Station (most
westbound trains would depart one minute earlier) and adjust the time by about one minute for
eastbound trains arriving at Auraria West Station. No cost impacts anticipated.

Call-nRide
Golden Call-n-Ride
The Golden Call-n-Ride began operating in April 2013 with the opening of the West Line
under a Congestion Mitigation Air Quality Improvement Grant (CMAQ) sponsored by the
City of Golden, the Colorado School of Mines and the RTD. The RTD contributes 50% of
the local match contributed towards the grant. The Call-n-Ride operates one vehicle as a
Flex Route and two vehicles as a non-flex route Call-n-Ride on weekdays. The Call-n-Ride
operates Monday-Friday 5:30am – 8:00pm and Saturdays 8:00am – 7:00pm. On
Saturday, the Call-n-Ride operates one vehicle as a Call-n-Ride. This recommendation is to
add an additional 3.5 hours service on the weekday service. Weekday service is currently
at 7.4 boardings per hour. This additional service will provide additional am service to the
Call-n-Ride to meet customer’s service demand. Cost impact is anticipated to be an
estimated $28,789 annualized.

Packet Pg. 12

Attachment: Atch A January 2016 Service Change revised (2550 : January 2016 Service Plan)

adjust evening trips (between 6-8 PM) by 15 minutes southbound from Denver Union Station to
create a more balanced schedule along with the C Line, similar to the midday schedule.
Total hours required: 9:23 hours daily (Mondays-Thursdays and Fridays), 2,391 annual hours.
Cost impacts are anticipated to be approximately $283,000 annualized.

Recommended Changes to the
Agency Reduced Fare Program

Non-Profit

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that RTD staff be authorized to
make changes to the RTD Non-Profit Agency Reduced Fare Program as detailed in Attachment A of this
action to be implemented by January 1, 2016.
BACKGROUND
RTD’s Non-Profit Agency Reduced Fare Program has been in existence for more than 25 years. The
purpose of the program is to offer government agencies and nonprofit organizations the opportunity to
purchase discounted RTD fare media for distribution to their low income clients. There are currently over
240 participating agencies. Those agencies purchase approximately $5.8 million annually in RTD fare
media at a variety of reduced rates.
Many agencies currently participating in the program and agencies that have chosen not to participate in
the program have indicated that some of the program’s administrative requirements are somewhat
burdensome. Those requirements include the submittal of quarterly and annual reports and maintaining a
distribution log for each pass or ticket distributed.
DISCUSSION
In March 2015, RTD staff surveyed 360 staff members of current participating agencies to seek input
regarding desired program changes. 140 responses were received, a 39 percent response rate. Many of
the staff recommended program changes were suggested by agencies in that survey. A second survey
of the same participating agencies was conducted from September 28 through October 15. Agencies
were asked to comment on the staff proposed changes that were presented to the RTD Board at the
September 29 Study Session. Thus far, 28 responses have been received from agencies. The
recommended changes to administrative requirements received overwhelming support, as did the
simplification of discounts on monthly pass products. Several agencies did express concern over the
proposed change in the discount for 10-Ride Ticket Books from the current 60 percent to 50 percent.
After consideration of the input from the agencies, staff feels that the overall package of changes to the
program will provide a net benefit to agencies and will enable many current agencies to expand their
participation and for new agencies to join the program. The staff recommendations are contained in
Attachment A of this document.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
In 2014, RTD received $2.5 million in revenue from participating agencies in exchange for fare media
with a face value of $5.8 million. Staff anticipates that the demand for discounted fare media will
increase under the proposed program changes and is recommending that an annual cap of $6.8 million in
fare media face value be implemented initially until such time as the financial impact of the proposed

Packet Pg. 25

1.B.2

changes can be better evaluated. If the proposed $6.8 million annual cap is met, revenue to RTD would
increase to approximately $3.4 million annually.
ALTERNATIVES
1.
Adopt the proposed changes to the RTD Non-Profit Agency Reduced Fare Program to be
implemented by January 1, 2016 with an annual cap of $6.8 million in fare media face value that
would increase program revenue to RTD to by approximately $160,000. This is the recommended
alternative.
2.

Adopt the proposed changes to the RTD Non-Profit Agency Reduced Fare Program as detailed in
Attachment A, but cap annual sales at the current level of $5.8 million in fare media face value.
This is not recommended because with the changes in prices of fare media associated with this
program having increased with the pending fare increase, agencies would be able to provide
fewer rides to their clients.

3.

Do not adopt the proposed changes and maintain the program with current fare media discounts
and administrative requirements. This is not recommended as staff feels the recommended
changes will improve availability of reduced fare RTD fare media for low income individuals.

APPENDIX A
RTD NON-PROFIT AGENCY REDUCED FARE PROGRAM RECOMMENDATIONS FOR 2016
The goal is to streamline this program and make it more affordable and accessible for customers and
more manageable for agencies.
Fundamental Program Changes
 Change the name of the program from “RTD Non-Profit Agency Reduced Fare Program” to “RTD
Nonprofit Program”.
 Offer new Day Pass Ticket Books as another fare option for agencies.
 Offer the same 50% discount on all fare media (10-Ride Ticket Books, Day Pass Ticket Books and
all regular and discount monthly passes) and eliminate quantity restrictions previously part of
the 40% monthly pass program. Currently, there are three program components with different
discounts:
a. 60% discount on 10-Ride Ticket Books (all types, regular and discount)
b. 25% discount on monthly passes (all types, regular and discount)
c. 40% discount on monthly passes (regular local only, limit of 25)
 Permit agencies to recover up to 100% of the price paid to RTD from their clients for all fare
media. Currently this is only allowed on the 25% monthly pass component of the program and
the agency is required to have a minimum contribution of 25% of the face value of the pass.
Administrative Changes for Participating Agencies
 Eliminate quarterly and annual reports, replace with an annual agency CEO certification of
continued compliance with program policies and procedures and periodic agency audits.
 Eliminate the requirement that agencies maintain a distribution log for each pass or ticket
distributed.
 Allow the distribution from primary account holder to other partner agencies with proper
documentation.
 Permit agencies to return unused monthly passes for credit to their account.
 Limit agencies to one order per calendar month.
 Orders may be picked up by appointment or may be shipped at agency’s expense.
 Implement cap of $575,000 per month in fare media face value, at least initially. Existing
program participants currently purchase an average of $485,000 per month in fare media face
value. Cap represents an 18% increase over current sales.
 Existing agencies will be guaranteed the ability to purchase current average monthly pass/ticket
quantities plus 10%

Board Meeting Date: October 27, 2015

Subject:

Free Rides for Members of the Military

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations & Customer Services Committee that free rides on RTD for active
duty members of the United States Military should be extended from the presently approved date of
December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016. Utilization has been minimal to date and this extension will
have minimal impact on RTD.
BACKGROUND
At the October 30, 2006 Special Board Meeting, the RTD Board of Directors approved a resolution
allowing active duty U.S. Military personnel to ride free on all RTD services through the end of 2006.
This offer has been extended annually by the Board since that time and is now valid through December
31, 2015. As a result of these actions, all active duty members of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines,
Coast Guard, National Guard, and Reserves are entitled to ride free on any RTD service including special
services such as SkyRide and BroncosRide. To be eligible to ride for free, active duty military personnel
must either be in uniform or present an active duty military ID card.
DISCUSSION
Staff recommends that the RTD Board of Directors extend this offer beyond the current expiration date
of December 31, 2015 and that the expiration date be extended by one year at this time and revisited
again next year.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The exact financial impact of this action is not known, but is expected to be minimal.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Extend free rides on RTD for active duty members of the United States Military should from the
presently approved date of December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016. This is the staff
recommendation.
2. Do not extend RTD’s program offering free rides for active duty members of the United States
Military.

Board Safety Presentation

Information

ACTION
This information update from Communications details the need for and execution of a robust new safety
awareness campaign throughout our communities.
BACKGROUND
Safety is RTD’s highest priority. Our current safety awareness campaign has been in place for 4 years, and
with the opening of 5 new lines and an expanding base system, the need exists for a more robust and
updated safety campaign across our entire fleet that appeals to all age groups. Through discussions with our
friends at Metro Melbourne Transit, we have been able to license and adapt the wildly successful Dumb
Ways to Die campaign to our system (the first time in the US). Dumb Ways uses humorous cartoon
characters in ridiculously perilous situations to drive home the very preventable things people do to put
themselves at risk around transit. We are adapting this program for the Denver market and will utilize a
significant web presence, coupled with trades, our own fleet space, paid and significant earned media to
permeate the market and create positive conversations around transit safety.
DISCUSSION
Dumb Ways to Die is a proven success and worldwide phenomenon. Since its inception in 2013, the
program has directly correlated to a 30% decrease in preventable accidents on the Melbourne system. The
infectious video and song have received 100 million views on YouTube, generated more than 127 million
pledges to be safe around transit, 150 million downloads, and 5 million social media shares. The program
has also generated more than 700 news stories with an estimated paid media value of $50 million. It is the
3rd most shared item ever on social media. The reach of this program is international and we will leverage its
global appeal to connect with our customers and communities to raise consciousness and awareness across
our system about the need to be safe around our buses and trains.
