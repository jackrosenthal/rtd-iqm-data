## II. CU Leeds Forecast (Howerter/CU)

Terry Howerter greeted the Board and introduced the Leeds School of Business CU team: Brian Lewandowski, Miles Light, and Richard Wobbekind who joined the meeting to present an update on their Economic Forecast for RTD.  It was noted that Robert McNown wasn’t able to be present for the meeting, but is very much involved with the project and worked on the presentation as well. The Leeds presentation is available in the September 24, 2013 Study Session Agenda Packet.

Key presentation points included:

- The Leeds team followed the same organizational structure as used in their prior forecasts.

- Denver is recovering well from the latest recession, with employment figures sitting about 2% above the standard.  Denver is recovering faster than the State, and the State is recovering faster than the nation.

- There is significant uncertainty in the current market, such as the current government debt ceiling, the European recession, the middle-east crisis, etc.

- The Leeds team compares their forecasts to other forecasts, such as the Colorado Legislative Council and the Colorado State Office of Planning and Budgeting.

- The Leeds team does not add additional factors; they do not adjust the numbers because they do not want to change the output and feel it is inappropriate to alter the numbers.

Director Lubow inquired if factors such as climate change , or related disasters like drought and flooding, are taken into consideration in the Forecast.

Brian Lewandowski advised that the team is always monitoring leading indicators in the model and reviewing historical data, going back 20, 30 and 40 years.  Past data and current trends are included in the Forecast.  The team does a series of sensitivity studies using different analytics; however, the forecasters cannot account for every scenario.

Director Lubow wondered if this particular forecast model had been used in 2006, would it have forecasted the subprime bubble.

Richard Wobbekind responded that the short answer is no.  Mr. Wobbekind explained that there is an auto-correct piece of the forecast that incorporates change quickly and provides feedback more rapidly than other models but it is very difficult to call an economic turn.  Terry Howerter stated that back in 2009 RTD instituted a policy to set aside a savings goal of $90 million to prepare for any possible future economic downturn.

Director Folska thanked the team for their efforts and made note that she finds the RTD-Leeds School of Business partnership extremely valuable.  Dr. Folska commented that she finds demographics fascinating.  She inquired if the Leeds team uses the agency policylink.org and offered that they are a valuable organization. Director Folska also wanted to know if HB 13-1272 was included in the forecasting.

Brian Lewandowski confirmed that the team did include the House Bill data and referenced page 16 of the presentation.  He said that while it wasn’t included in the models, RTD staff provided their estimates.  There is a column of data showing projected RTD revenues from the model and another column that shows the increases with HB 13-1272 added.

Director Walker commented that he found the forecasting fascinating and he wondered if the team has compared our data to similar transportation entities in similar demographics.

Brian Lewandowski answered that they have not but that it would be a good idea to do so.  Mr. Lewandowski pointed out that Colorado is out-performing the nation in a number of economic metrics.

Director Sisk questioned if the team going forward could forecast the impact of government spending, such as in the case of FasTracks, on the economy.   Director Sisk asked if there are any statistics that would auger what has happened with FasTracks and how those related projects have impacted our economy.

Mr. Lewandowski advised that when sequestration impacts the economy, the team is concerned.  There is an uncertainty factor; however, the team has not looked at the specific economic impact referenced by Director Sisk.  Mr. Lewandowski anticipates the team will be performing additional studies due to the recent floods.  Such studies might give the team an indication of how much government spending would be happening in terms of allocation of funds being spent on repair and rebuild jobs.

Director Lassiter inquired if the teams’ forecast model covers the loss of sales, such as internet sales.

Mr. Lewandowski shared that the team is looking at actual RTD and state projections, and that the internet sales data is included in the forecast to some extent.

Director Bagley stated that he has been on the RTD Board for 5 years and he feels strongly that the whole idea of independent analysis, outside of RTD, is imperative.

Director Bagley also made note that Black Swan events are all but impossible to account for.  He believes it would be foolish to try to incorporate anything in the budget that is at a national level.

Chair Anderson commented that she was initially skeptical of the Leeds forecasting, having come from a municipality that was accustomed to using doomsday forecasts.  Chair Anderson thanked the team and appreciates their candor in their forecasting.

## III. IMG Update (Scott Reed/Tony McCaulay)

Scott Reed greeted the Board and referred the members to a Board approved RFP that RTD sent out August 2012 for the purposes of creating  a partnership with a company known for its expertise in creating corporate sponsorship programs.  IMG was the successful bidder of the RFP and comes to RTD with significant history, experience and success in corporate sponsorship programs, both nationally and internationally.  A video about IMG was shown.

Mr. Reed explained that IMG is present this evening to provide an update with a power point presentation on developing and implementing a three-phase corporate sponsorship program.  Mr. Reed introduced the IMG team:  Bianca de Jager – Senior Account Manager, Todd Parker - Vice President with IMG Consulting, and Jay Kenney - Senior Vice President and the Managing Director for special projects at IMG.  The IMG presentation is available for review in the September 24, 2013 Study Session Agenda Packet.

After review of the IMG presentation, Scott Reed reported that staff will now work to bring forth various packages for the Board to review and approve to move forward with a viable corporate sponsorship program that is the best fit for RTD.

General Manager Washington interjected that this presentation culminated from strategic goals that were established going back a couple of years ago and moved forward in accordance with Board approval.  General Manager Washington stated that he sees the implementation of a corporation sponsorship program as an opportunity to increase RTD sales revenue and simultaneously add additional services within the RTD Denver metro districts.

Chair Anderson thanked the IMG team and asked the Board members for comments or questions, reminding everyone that there are still two important items on the agenda.

Director James commented that he is very excited about the possibility of the creation and implementation of a corporate sponsorship program, and that he perceives this program as a great opportunity.  Director James wondered which assets were valued, how they were valued, and what percentage of RTD assets would staff look to seek sponsorship. He asked if it was felt that ridership would expand as a result of instituting a corporate sponsorship program.

Ms. de Jager advised that the project was divided into three main phases.  Phase one is where IMG has identified all RTD assets and defined the sponsorship packages, valued the assets and also priced the packages.  During phase two IMG defined the communication plan in order to launch the plan into the market; they also defined the solicitation process and are in the process of defining the sponsorship guidelines.  IMG has not worked through phase three yet. Phase three will be where IMG actually launches the program into the market, working to find partners for all RTD assets.

Todd Parker expounded on the different phases and felt that in theory, corporate sponsorship should increase ridership, based on recent experience coming from two different transit authorities IMG are working with currently.  Those transit systems are very old and falling apart, needing significant repair and upgrades.  In those transit areas, a portion of sponsorship money will be used to remodel and improve their stations as opposed to putting those funds into a general fund to offset debt.

That scenario doesn’t exist here because the RTD system is in pretty good shape.  However, having additional amenities, better facilities, and increased security should, in theory, increase ridership.

Bianca de Jager explained that as part of the sponsorship package, the sponsor will have the opportunity to host events at the stations which will also increase ridership.

Director James also wondered about branding and sponsorship of corridors where RTD has multiple lines.  He asked if this has ever been done.

Jay Kenney shared that the Chicago CTA approach was to issue an RFP for a small percentage of their assets which was11 stations of the 144 in their system; however, the RFP was written to indicate that they would consider responses that included other assets.  He noted that what was learned from that was half of the bids that came back were for line sponsorship, something CTA and IMG hadn’t contemplated or anticipated.  For many reasons, the line sponsorship has an equal if not greater sponsorship value to an individual station.  In terms of seeing any company opt for multiple lines that is something that IMG has not seen as pricing would likely prohibit multiple line sponsorship.

Director Folska told Scott Reed and the IMG team that she really supports the corporate sponsorship concept and feels strongly that this is the direction that RTD need to be moving toward implementing.  Director Folska requested an electronic copy of the IMG presentation.

Director Folska wondered about Sports Authority and other known historical locations such as Union Station, and how naming rights have worked in the past or how they would work in the future for these types of well-known locations.  Director Folska questioned if a moving advertisement was more valuable than stationary advertisement.  She assumed a greater value would be seen with moving advertising like RTD light rail lines.  Also, Director Folska inquired if Communications and the IMG team have thought out how RTD can protect its assets from undesirable sponsorship and naming rights.

Bianca de Jager explained that while a stadium might not move there is a huge amount of exposure do to the media component so the value would be much higher than a light rail line.

Scott Reed replied that staff would look diligently at each potential sponsorship package before ever bringing it to the Board for consideration and that he is very sensitive to undesirable sponsorship.  Mr. Reed noted that there would be scenarios of sponsorship that RTD would simply not consider.  Staff would defer to Marla Lien regarding any possible liabilities.

Director Folska inquired how IMG are paid for their work on these types of projects.

Todd Parker responded that IMG are paid on commission only in the range of 12 - 15% of revenues.

Director Lasater voiced concern over naming rights of well-known venues, as in the case of Sports Authority Field at Mile High or Sports Authority Field at Parker.  He noted concern for consumer related frustrations and hoped that any corporate sponsorship program would take these types of concerns into serious consideration before implementation of any such program.

Jay Kenney informed the Board that IMG establishes quantitative and qualitative filters that potential sponsors have to go through before they are ever recommended to RTD.  This data is filtered before IMG ever makes recommendation of an appropriate fit for RTD. IMG currently use a 55/44 split model; with quantitative valued at 55% and qualitative valued at 45%.  IMG follows standard advertising guidelines and consider all possible liabilities.  Mr. Kenney noted that there is always a way for IMG to decline a sponsorship that would not be an appropriate fit for RTD.

Mr. Kenney further explained that the naming rights culture is always subject or vulnerable to mergers and acquisitions.   In terms of renaming a given location, the name will always include the location.  Mr. Kenney stated for example, Union Station will always be Union Station.  It might become AT&T Union Station or Coca Cola Union Station, but that the location name would remain intact.

Mr. Kenney observed that historically, primary assets will warrant a 5-year minimum sponsorship term while lesser assets would more likely be at a 3-year sponsorship commitment.

Director Daly shared that RTD will appreciate the income from this initiative and that staff must bear in mind to never change the geographic location of a station.  Director Daly also noted a concern for our ridership potentially feeling forced to listen to overhead advertisements; he didn’t feel this would be appreciated by our ridership.

Director Lubow shared that Sports Authority will pay $150 Million over the next 25 years to have their name on the Stadium.    She noted a concern of people having difficulties remembering things if they are constantly experiencing changing names.

Director Lubow noted that she has philosophical issues with public property being named with corporate sponsorship. She wondered if the Board will have some ability to dictate input in terms of how a name sounds, for example Union Station sponsored by AT&T versus AT&T Union Station.  Director Lubow would like the public aspect of the name to remain first because the public paid for the asset.

Scott Reed noted that corporate sponsorship will be presented to the Board in different packages and the value of a sponsorship will have to be given individual consideration.

Director Lubow asked if the Board could set a policy regarding corporate naming rights, so that the sponsorship name wouldn’t be listed first.  Director Lubow commented that she also doesn’t want to present a feeling to the public that might seem like the corporate entity owns the asset because they don’t own the asset.

General Manager Washington stated that there will be much more discussion on this matter.  There is much to take into consideration.  General Manager Washington advised that while RTD wants to protect our assets, we do not want to devalue an asset by limiting naming rights sponsorship.

Chair Anderson reminded all parties that this meeting is a preliminary meeting and that no decisions or actions will be taken during this meeting.

Director Solano noted a 2007 rule passed by the legislature that mandates that 50% of RTD is public and 50% is private.  He expressed concern that we are losing that.  He does not want a Waste Management Commerce City Line.  He believes we should stay RTD and keep the private sector out.  Marla Lien explained that the stature relates to operation of fixed route service and does not apply to advertising.

Director Hoy questioned the difference between naming rights and advertising. He wondered if RTD was substituting one type of revenue for another.  Scott Reed stated that it would depend on what the sponsor was interested in.  He said that if we were to remove advertisements from our vehicles that lost revenue would need to be recouped in the sponsorship package.

Director Menten echoed Director Lubow’s concerns about corporate sponsorship naming rights and public property.  Director Menten feels strongly that discussion on this matter should occur now, as opposed to when the contract work has been completed.  Director Menten voiced concern over prior instances when unease was being voiced on a matter; the voiced unease was met with comments such as “we’ve already done all this work so we have to move forward.”

Director Menten asked for clarification of the term compensation in-kind.

Todd Parker shared that compensation in-kind refers to, for example, an item that might equal a sponsorship amount, such as specific goods and services to RTD.  One example would be construction goods.  Value-in-kind can be a common component of naming rights.

Director Sisk shared that he also had mixed feelings about a corporate sponsorship program in terms of changing names.  He agreed that economics are important but that we will want to be careful moving forward.

Jay Kenney commented that there has to be a comfort level for this type of program to work.  IMG is going to recommend seeing sponsorship for 10% of RTD assets.  There is a way to seek this type of sponsorship without turning the consumer base off.  IMG has completed extensive market research to test out consumer comfort level.

Director Sisk reiterated that he felt there was still a great deal of work to do prior to moving forward.  Director Sisk asserted that while all everyone wants to see a gain in revenue, staff also needs to ensure that RTD has all the pertinent information needed to have a full understanding of public assets and naming rights.

Chair Anderson also noted that she has real concern over naming rights of public property and that when the Board meets again on this topic, staff will need to address all associated discomfort.

Director Deadwyler indicated she too has angst over the matter, especially in terms of partnering with any type of undesirable business, and that she would not support doing business with companies that don’t have a good reputation with our public, such as Wal-Mart.

General Counsel Marla Lien explained that the business model being discussed was really more like a partnership as opposed to standard advertising.  RTD would be afforded far more discretion over matters, including who RTD would partner with.

Director Deadwyler commented that she did not wish to see RTD in a scenario where its services might be boycotted.

Ms. Lien reiterated that the Board will participate in the sponsorship selection process and has ultimate approval or rejection.  If the Board doesn’t want to pursue a specific sponsorship, RTD will not pursue that partnership.

Director Walker noted that our country has a history of combining public and private assets so he doesn’t have any big concerns. He wonders if some assets more valuable when identified by region/location.

Scott Reed indicated that these types of considerations are part of the whole package.  For instance, considering the16th Street Mall, there is a lot of current interest for advertising in this area where there is a lot of traffic.  Naming rights for this area will create more revenue than for a small bus line.

Director Menten noted that she would have preferred to get all the related presentation materials prior to the meeting.  Director Menten also questioned when the Board took the action to vote on IMG as the successful bidder for the August 2012 RFP.

General Manager Washington suggested that the next step for the corporate sponsorship project would be to provide the Board a copy of the original report that was previously approved.

Lacy Bell stated that she had been talking with the City and County of Denver.  She reminded the Board that they had approved a few things earlier in the year, one of those things being free 18th/19th Circulator service.  Ms. Bell advised that they have come up with a name and brand for this project, calling it the Free Metro Ride.

Steve Reilly, marketing manager with the Communications Department stated that he had been working with Lacy’s group.  Mr. Reilly stated that they looked at the mall ride in very specific geographic locations.  They decided to use the “metro” term in the name because it is very contemporary, providing RTD with flexibility should staff choose to run a service throughout town.  The theme is very progressive with two vibrant colors, mustard and teal, painting the tops of the buses and leaving the bottoms of the buses with an unpainted metal base.  The Free Metro Ride buses where designed to look drastically different so they would be easily identifiable.

Kate Wilson added that these colors circumvent from traditional RTD bus themes because staff wants the Free Metro Ride buses to stand out from other RTD vehicles.

Director Lubow commented that the team had done good work and had come up with an attractive design.

### 1. IMG Update

## IV. Youth Art Pilot Program (Folska/Reilly)

Director Folska shared that she had been thinking about a youth art competition for some time now. She was interested in a program that would encourage and educate our communities about all the different aspects of RTD.   Director Folska advised that the pilot program would kick off in the middle schools of Aurora and Cherry Creek school districts, noting that the best way to eat an elephant is bite by bite.  Director Folska shared that since RTD is limited on funding sources, she has agreed to seek additional outside funding.

Mr. Reilly reiterated that the student art competition is really a way to engage and educate our communities and to influence ridership within our communities.  The pilot program will involve some 19 thousand students.  The theme is based on “I HEART MY RTD” and to show that RTD is a viable transportation mode that can fit into every lifestyle.  The goal is to kick the program off in the January/February timeframe, wrapping it up late in February or early March.  Mr. Reilly commented that the love theme works with Valentine’s Day, has a lot of strength, should be fun, and that there will be significant RTD participation.

Mr. Reilly noted that each school will select their finalists’ and those individuals with the winning pieces of art would be sent forward to RTD.  RTD would have a committee and would make available open voting online in a way that voting could not be stacked.

Mr. Reilly stated that the winner’s design would be wrapped on a bus for a specified time period, such as 6 months.  This program would create a great deal of public relations and media coverage putting RTD in a positive light with the potential for the community to get behind the program.

Director Folska noted that the team did a great job.

Director Deadwyler shared that she really likes this art competition; she feels it is very sophisticated and will provide an exciting opportunity for community outreach.

Director Folska thanked Director Deadwyler and commented that the program was a team effort.  She added that she was certain the program would be a success because the marketing team is so passionate about their work.

Director Solano also agreed the program was a great idea and that communications should be prepared in both English and Spanish.  Director Folska appreciated that feedback.

Director Lubow noted that she “hearts” the program; it is very clever and heartwarming, and she predicts it will bring in new ridership and goodwill in the community.

Director Walker added that he liked the idea and shared that in his past experience in jobs and projects that involved community input, you could see self-respect rise within that community.

Director Menten noted that she hoped costs for this program would not come out of RTD funds.

Chair Anderson commented that she believed external funding was being sought.

Mr. Reilly confirmed that staff is soliciting external sponsors with the hopes that the program grows in the future such that sponsorship would grow to be community wide.

Chair Anderson agreed this art competition would be a very fun program.

Director Deadwyler commented that she believes when RTD initiates a project RTD should be a contributor.

## V. 2014 Budget (Scarpino)

Terry Howerter addressed the Board and introduced Jannette Scarpino to present the Budget update which is available in the September 24, 2013 Study Session Agenda Packet.

Ms. Scarpino provided a brief overview of the process, assumptions and key elements.  Ms. Scarpino stated that the Board still has the opportunity to provide input to the budget, and she explained that the requested budget is a draft only; it is subject to changes and revisions.

Ms. Scarpino advised that the operating budget has come in below the initial projections.  FasTracks constructions and operations numbers are pretty solid.  The Capital budget is preliminary.  Ms. Scarpino shared that the summaries found on page 3 show all operating and non-operating revenue as well as summaries of all operating expenses, debt service, and capital expenditures.  Staff are projecting fare revenue increased $5.6 million due to the goal of increasing ridership by 2.8%, plus a full year of the West Line in operation.

RTD does not have a lock on diesel at this time and so we do not have budget certainty regarding fuel costs.

Ms. Scarpino advised that on October 15, staff will present a budget update to the Financial Administration and Audit committee. On November 19, staff will present a recommended budget to the Financial Administration and Audit committee, and hope to present the final budget for adoption by the Board on November 16, 2013.

Ms. Scarpino reminded everyone that this was a brief overview and that she was available to meet individually with anyone who had any questions on the 2014 requested budget.

Director Bagley made note that we’d been in the meeting over 3 hours and that we had probably just now gotten to the important aspect of the meeting.  Director Bagley indicated that it would be prudent for Board members to spend time with Ms. Scarpino individually prior to October 15th.

Director Walker echoed Director Bagley’s comments, but did wonder if we had or expected to have any impact from the flooding around the District.

General Manager Washington reported that staff is still assessing but haven’t seen much impact currently.   As previously indicated, there was some heavy flooding in Boulder, but staff has seen no catastrophic failures, no walls came down.  General Manager Washington stated that if staff does find something that is substantial, we will coordinate with the federal government for reimbursements.

Chair Anderson noted that there were no other speakers.  Chair commented that she appreciates all the work being performed on the budget.  Chair did question the current diesel prices.

General Manager Washington indicated that at this time, staff is seeing the float price.  Staff continues to monitor the futures market to see if or when RTD should do a price lock.

Chair Anderson encouraged members of the Board to make an appointment with Ms. Scarpino to review any issues regarding the 2014 requested budget so that everyone is prepared to move forward on budget approval in November.

## VI. Other Matters

General Manager Washington commented that he sent the Board an email last night on North Metro.  RTD received 4 proposals from Herzog (Bechtel, Herzog, JV and AECOM), GMMH (Graham, Balfour, Beatty and Hamon), NMTS (Kiewit, Stacy and Witbeck, JV) and URS.  Staff is in the midst of very technical and complex solicitation and evaluation. Staff plans to come to the Board October 8 to walk through the evaluation criteria and the evaluation components.  On November 5, staff will come back to the Board with their recommendation on this solicitation.  On November 14 there will be a special FasTracks Monitoring Committee Meeting with public comment. At that time staff will be asking the Board to move the action to the Board meeting scheduled for November 26 for final Board action. General Manager Washington noted that this was a very aggressive schedule for a very complex solicitation and evaluation.  Staff will want to keep moving forward because RTD wants to announce the award decision so we can break ground early January.

## VII. Adjourn

Chair Anderson adjourned the meeting at 8:35 p.m.
