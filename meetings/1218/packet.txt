Interpreting the Model Forecasts
• Forecasts represent a best estimate at a given point in
time
• Updated quarterly to reflect the most current economic
situation
• Forecasts are generated from economic relations,
modeled with state-of-the-art methods of modern
econometric time series analysis
• BRD forecasts do not incorporate “add factors” or other
subjective adjustments of model forecasts
• BRD is independent from RTD with no political or
financial stake in the forecast numbers

Corporate Based Market Research

1.

Despite the novelty of the project / idea, the interviewed companies are very familiar with
sponsorships and naming rights. Overall the concept of public-private partnerships is very well
received. Companies are open to new opportunities and are supportive of community-building
initiatives.

2.

Generally speaking, rail lines are the preferred assets to be sponsored by companies followed by
transit stations and bus routes.

3.

Advertising and signage are the most interesting benefits for companies, followed by naming
rights and on site activities.

4.

The preferred term of agreement should be 3-5 years in duration.

5.

Majority of companies were reluctant to provide any definitive feedback on fees without seeing a
detailed sponsorship package outlining benefits that RTD would offer potential sponsors. However,
most respondents stated they would be open to pay between $500K-$1.5M annually to sponsor
designated RTD Denver assets.

6.

Companies feel strongly that authenticity and noticeable difference is key for a partnership with
RTD to be effective.

7.

Some companies may want a small portion of their money being allocated towards making a
visible difference within the sponsored asset.

• A corporate partnership program will help RTD achieve its goals of increasing nontraditional forms of revenue in an effort to provide safe and affordable transportation,
enhance facilities and services and improve riders experience.
• RTD riders and non-riders have a very positive opinion about this initiative and
indicated that corporate sponsorships are an effective way to generate additional
revenue for RTD and help improving RTD services, maintenance and security.
• Companies are receptive to hear more about this corporate partnership program once
sponsorship packages are available for review.
• The corporate partnership program should consist of holistic sponsorship packages that
combine rights and benefits such as category exclusivity, advertising, signage,
collateral material, online visibility and on-site rights. Advertising and signage are the
most valuable benefits as well as the most interesting rights for companies.
• It’s key not to over commercialize the RTD system to avoid confusion among riders,
generate a competitive scenario among companies and maintain the exclusivity and
uniqueness of the opportunity.

Board Meeting Date: September 24, 2013

Subject:

2014 Requested Budget

BACKGROUND
Staff is required to present the 2014 Requested Budget to the Board of Directors prior to
posting it for public inspection. RTD must post its 2014 Requested Budget for public review
and comment by October 15, 2013 in order to meet Colorado legal requirements (CRS 29-1101). The preliminary 2014 Requested Budget is included in order to comply with these
requirements.
At this time, Staff is presenting the preliminary first draft 2014 Requested Budget.
Preliminary 2014 Requested Budget numbers are subject to further revision and a budget
update will be presented at the October 15th Financial Administration and Audit Committee
meeting. The 2014 Recommended Budget will then be presented at the November 19th
Financial Administration and Audit Committee meeting with Staff requesting approval to move
to the Board of Directors for ratification of the 2014 Adopted Budget on November 26th.
DISCUSSION
The Board has requested that staff keep it informed on key budget issues that RTD is facing
and provide opportunities for Board members to offer early input during the development of
the 2014 annual budget.
During development of the 2014-2019 Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) for the Base System, staff
presented a balanced budget to the Board for 2014. Staff has worked to develop a
preliminary proposed budget for the Base System as set forth in the approved 2014-2019 SBP
with no material change at this time.

Overview
The 2014 Requested Budget is a first draft budget and includes estimates for sources and
uses. The budget items will continue to be reviewed and the final version incorporating any
necessary adjustments will be the 2014 Recommended Budget scheduled for adoption in
November. This Requested Budget will be updated for items such as fare revenue estimates,
sales taxes, grant revenue, and capital expenditures for both new capital and capital carry
forward amounts. Operating expenses may be revised for specific changes but any changes
are expected to be minor.
Staff has developed the 2014 Requested Budget based on guidance from the SBP for 2014
for the Base System and incorporated the FasTracks 2014 budget. The 2014 Requested
Budget on a combined basis includes the following:
(1) Fare revenue:
a. No fare rate increase for 2014 is budgeted. The Board historically has
reviewed the need for fare rate increases every three years. A fare rate
increase is not proposed for 2014.

Packet Pg. 57

5.1

b. Fare revenue on the Base System is budgeted to increase $3.2 million based
on 2.8% growth in ridership.
c. An increase in FasTracks fare revenue of $2.4 million is budgeted due to
West Line full year of operations in 2014. Total fare revenue for West Line
is budgeted at $5.6 million in 2014 which comes from the FasTracks model
forecast. The amount may change in the Recommended Budget as we
continue to review passenger counts.
d. Combined fare revenue is budgeted at $125.0 million, which is an increase
of $5.6 million over the 2013 Amended Budget. The amount may change in
the Recommended Budget as we continue to monitor actuals for 2013.
(2) Other operating revenue:
a. This amount includes advertising revenue, joint venture revenue, and
miscellaneous operating revenue.
b. Amounts are kept flat from 2013 Amended Budget due primarily to a 2-year
advertising contract in effect until 12/31/14. The current run rate for other
operating revenue is on track with budget.
(3) Sales/use tax:
a. Combined sales/use tax of $487.6 million is budgeted to increase 4.5% over
the 2013 projection, concurrent with the CU-Leeds School of Business June
forecast. The budget will be updated with the CU-Leeds School September
forecast.
(4) Grant revenue:
a. Of total grant revenue, operating grant revenue is $81.0 million from the
Base System, which is budgeted to increase 11.4% over the 2013 Amended
Budget based on identified increases in fixed guideway grants, State of
Good Repair grants, and new Section 5339 Bus Facilities and mall paver
grants.
b. Remaining grant funds consist of capital grant revenue of $194.8 million.
Of this amount, $26.1 million is budgeted in the Base System and $168.7
million is budgeted in FasTracks. Capital grant revenue is expected to
decline due to identified decreases in West Corridor New Starts grants,
CMAQ grants, and certain state grants.
c. As more information becomes available and the capital carry forward budget
is finalized, capital grant revenue estimates will change accordingly in the
Recommended Budget.
(5) Investment income:
a. Combined investment income is projected to decrease $0.8 million from the
2013 Amended Budget due to lower short term rates that have not
increased recently in tandem with longer term rates.
In addition,
unrestricted investable fund balances on the Base System are projected to
decline as project funds are drawn down for fleet purchases.
(6) Other (non-operating) income:
a. The combined $20.1 million includes sale of DUS Block B for $10 million, of
which $7.383 million will be retained by the Base System. The Base
System will contribute the remaining $2.617 million to the Stapleton park-nRide construction project.
b. Combined remaining other miscellaneous non-operating income will decline
by $5.1 million from the 2013 Amended Budget in a return to customary

Packet Pg. 58

5.1

levels; a one-time sale of the Civic Center air rights for $8.0 million was
completed in 2013.
(7) Operating expenses:
a. District-wide operating expenses (including expense projects) of $497.2
million are budgeted to decline $57.5 million from the 2013 Amended
Budget due to project completion, carry forward, and expense transfers to
capital, as well as a reduction of $11.0 million for a one-time 2013 DUS
contribution. FasTracks Capital Programs will account for $27.6 million of
this decline due to completion of a US36/CDOT carry forward project.
b. Operating expenses are allocated to the West Line based on a cost allocation
model that allocates historical unit costs on the basis of resource drivers.
Sales tax is allocated from FasTracks in an amount to offset West Line costs
and result in sources minus uses of zero.
c. Diesel fuel is currently budgeted at $3.26/gallon, which is the same price
that was locked in 2013 for no incremental change.
d. Gasoline is budgeted at an average cost of $3.54/gallon, which is the same
price used in the 2013 Amended Budget for no incremental change.
(8) Debt:
a. Budgeted principal payments of $61.5 million are $15.0 million higher than
in the 2013 Amended Budget due to issuance of FasTracks revenue bonds
for system expansion/construction and Base system COPs for fleet
purchases.
b. Budgeted financing proceeds of $440 million result from anticipated new
debt for FasTracks consisting of $120 million in revenue bonds for the North
Metro rail line, $240 million in GARVEE interim debt and $80 million in TIFIA
loan draws for the Eagle Project construction.
(9) Interest expense:
a. Interest expense is budgeted at $82.1 million which is an increase of $2.7
million over the 2013 Amended Budget due to issuance of new debt
described above in (8) Debt. Of the total interest expense, $24.1 million is
budgeted for Base System and $58.0 million is budgeted on FasTracks.
b. Capitalized interest is budgeted at $45.0 million for FasTracks, an increase
of $9.8 million over the 2013 Amended Budget due to on-going construction
projects.
(10) Capital expenditures:
a. Base System new capital expenditures total $95.0 million. The amount
approved in the SBP totaled $92.4 million. The difference is due to the
$2.617 million added to the Stapleton park-n-Ride construction project as
noted above in (6) Other (non-operating) income.
b. FasTracks new capital expenditures are estimated at $723.9 million, which
is expected to change in the Recommended Budget as estimates for project
expenditures in 2014 are reviewed and completed.
c. Capital carry forward (previously approved capital) is not estimated at this
time but will be included in the Recommended Budget.
(11) Reserves:
a. The combined TABOR reserve is budgeted at $18.7 million.
b. The FasTracks contingency reserve is budgeted at $30.0 million which
reflects no change from 2013.

(12) Fund balances:
a. Base System:
i. Increase of $3.0 million to Board-appropriated fund per the SBP for a
total fund balance of $19.2 million.
ii. Increase of $3.0 million to capital acquisition fund per the SBP for a
total fund balance of $12.0 million.
iii. Anticipated decrease of $7.5 million to the unrestricted fund balance
for a total unrestricted fund balance of $6.9 million, in line with the
SBP.
iv. Fund balances are increased in a manner consistent with Board policy
and the SBP. The total of the above-referenced fund balances are
expected to be 9.1% of projected Base System operating expenses,
or $38.1 million by the end of 2014.
b. FasTracks:
i. The total of the Board-appropriated fund, the capital acquisition fund,
and the unrestricted fund reflect 2 months of operating expenses for
both FasTracks Project/Construction and FasTracks Operations (West
Line).
c. District-wide:
i. The total combined fund balances are expected to be 10.3% of
projected District-wide operating expenses by the end of 2014.
The preliminary 2014 Requested Budget and Fund Balance report which shows the operating
and capital sources and expenditures of the District for Base System and FasTracks is
included as Exhibit I.
