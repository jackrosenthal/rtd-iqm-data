BUDGET MESSAGE FROM THE GENERAL MANAGER AND CEO
I am pleased to introduce RTD’s Fiscal Year 2023 budget.
The FY 2023 Budget represents a financial plan for what’s next for the agency in the
coming year. Among the highlights:
• Continuation of the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan implementation framework,
aligning objective, measurable inputs with established strategic priorities and a
laser-like focus on employees’ efforts on metrics that matter to RTD’s overall
success outcomes

DEBRA A. JOHNSON

• Completion of the Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis to evaluate potential changes to the
fare structure and pass programs and develop recommendations to be considered for adoption by the
Board
• Implementation of the System Optimization Plan (SOP) with the January 2023 service change. Essentially,
the SOP sets the stage for the agency’s optimization of service delivery through the short-term component
of the Reimagine RTD effort, the agency’s Comprehensive Operations Analysis. The SOP is geared toward:
- Aligning service levels with workforce availability
- Increasing the agency’s focus on providing a high-quality, regional backbone network
- Sustaining the overall integrity of the transit network, and
- Maintaining assets in a state of good repair
RTD’s revenues, the funding that allows the agency to strive to deliver high-quality transit services, are derived
primarily from three main sources: sales and use taxes collected on goods and services purchased within RTD’s
service area; federal grants, which supplement not only RTD’s revenues but those of many transit agencies
across the country; and farebox revenues, the fares customers pay to utilize the agency’s services.
RTD, like most transit agencies across the country, was drastically impacted in the early days of the COVID-19
pandemic, as boardings plummeted and sales and use revenues declined as individuals, businesses, and
government entities went into lockdown. Federal rescue and relief funding provided a lifeline during difficult

BUDGET MESSAGE FROM THE GENERAL MANAGER AND CEO

1.D.1.c

(cont’d from page 3)

As the agency and the region continue to recover and stabilize from the pandemic’s impacts, we are
collectively finding new norms. Ridership is significantly lower now than in previous years. In fact, industry
analysts estimate that public transit agencies across the country will experience a permanent 15-20% decline
in ridership. Remote work shifts in the composition of the workforce, and competition from third parties such
as Uber and Lyft are just a few of the factors driving this change.
Public transit is among many industry sectors facing significant challenges, not least of which are critical
worker shortages, what I call people power problems, due to the Great Resignation that has taken place over
the past two years. I firmly believe that from that Great Resignation will follow a Great Reset, wherein
governments, industries, and individuals across the nation and the globe will have the opportunity forge a
new, sustainable path forward in a post-pandemic landscape; those with the foresight and determination to
seize this opportunity will reap great rewards. It is in this vein that transit industries have the chance to rewrite
old narratives about the purpose of public transit; no longer will transit agencies be measured solely by the
number of customers they can transport but rather by the value they deliver to the communities they serve.
This exciting and important discussion of “value over volume” continues to unfold across the agency at
agencies large and small.
Although we must recognize and account for many challenges, they are not what defines this agency.
I recognize, appreciate, and honor the collaborative efforts exhibited by all of the agency’s employees
and agency leaders, as well as the Board of Directors and our union and contractor partners during
these challenging times. I thank each of you for being one of the people who move people in the
Denver metro region.
Moreover, I extend my sincere thanks and appreciation for the contributions in the timely preparation of the
FY 2023 Budget to Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer; Todd Nickel, Senior Manager, Budget; Heidi
Wagner, Senior Manager, Finance; the Budget Analysts, and the Leadership Team.
As we look toward the upcoming year and reflect on the various changes and challenges we have
collectively endured, I am proud to reaffirm our commitment to the agency’s mission: “We make lives
better through connections.”
Sincerely,

Debra A. Johnson
General Manager and CEO

financial times, and the agency has put those funds to good use by focusing on bolstering people power;
aligning wages, salaries, and benefits with those of comparable positions in the market and sustaining transit
operations at a time when individuals in our communities relied upon RTD for access to critical services.

Introduction

This Budget demonstrates RTD’s financial capacity to address the agency’s strategic priorities based on
current information. The development of the Budget is a cross-departmental collaborative effort; hence
the proposed budget for the Board’s consideration is a collective staff recommendation.
For FY2023, the operating expense budget is $816.4 million, of which $28.9 million is carryforward from
2022 into 2023. New capital is $75.9 million and capital carry forward of $568.0 million for a total capital
budget of $643.9 million. Debt service is $225.8M and reserves are $516.4 million for a total appropriation
of $2,202 million.

Perspective
The 2023 Proposed Budget focuses on the Strategic Priorities of the Board-adopted 2021-2026 Strategic
Plan. As a result, funding appropriations are aligned in a manner to direct efforts towards achieving the
desired success outcomes as measured by specific metrics.
As society emerges from the most significant impacts from COVID-19, additional clarity has and is being
realized regarding the future state of public transit services in general, as well as RTD’s specific
experiences. In light of this, a System Optimization Plan (SOP) approved by the Board is incorporated
within this budget. Additionally, RTD has positioned itself to meet the financial needs to remediate
backlogs in project completion and ensure that assets are maintained in a state of good repair.
While RTD’s current financial position is strong and funding capacity is available to fund initiatives and
programs within the Strategic Priorities, it is expected that the agency will continue to be challenged with
accessing adequate non-financial resources as a result of the difficult labor market environment, supply
chain issues and inflation.
Economic conditions indicate that there is a potential for recession which historically has impacted RTD’s
largest source of revenue, sales and use taxes. Despite these economic headwinds, these tax collections
are still expected to grow modestly in 2023 as a result of high employment and projected gross domestic
product (GDP) growth within the District. Furthermore, RTD’s reserves remain in a strong position to
moderate financial impacts resulting from unexpected volatility.
Although challenging circumstances exist in the economy, beneficial opportunities exist. The higher
interest rate environment negates the opportunities for additional interest savings from debt refinancings,
however, RTD will benefit from higher investment returns. In addition, impacts from the high inflation
rate environment will be tempered somewhat by RTD’s debt instruments all being issued at fixed rates in
addition to many annual contractual increases already being fixed.

Financial Discussion and Analysis

Revenues
Revenue sources are generally either recurring or finite. RTD’s Fiscal Policy establishes that one-time
revenues be used for one-time expenditures while recurring revenues provide a sustainable source to fund
ongoing needs. Because one-time revenues have a finite term, commitments for recurring expenditures
require an alternative source once the one-time revenues are exhausted.
RTD’s sources of recurring revenue, in descending order of size, are sales and use taxes, fares, federal
operating grants and miscellaneous revenue from advertising, investment income and rent. Historically,
RTD has also been the recipient of one-time revenues from federal capital grants, federal COVID-19 relief
funding, local contributions and land sales. RTD does not budget or forecast one-time revenues unless
certainty exists.
Revenue assumptions for the Budget include the following:
•

Fare revenue has been adjusted downward from 2022 expectations due to lower ridership. The
2022 Budget anticipated a gradual, modest return of ridership due to increased in-person
participation at universities and anticipated return-to-work requirements during the emergence
from the COVID Pandemic. While ridership has recovered from its nadir of 30% of pre-COVID
levels to approximately 60% currently, it has fallen short of the 2022 expectations of a gradual
return to 85% of pre-COVID levels. As a result, the 2023 Budget reflects a 1.4% increase in
ridership in 2023 that will drive fare revenue. In a September 2022 report, Standard and Poor’s
predicts that public transportation ridership will only return to 75% of pre-pandemic levels by 2025.

Sales and use tax projections were provided by the University of Colorado Leeds School of Business
(CU Leeds) in August 2022 and presented to the RTD Board in September 2022. Based on Moody’s
economic forecasts, the CU Leeds forecast model predicts that tax collections will increase 2.2% in
2023 vs. 2022 primarily driven by continued high employment, population growth and real GDP
growth in the Denver metro area. In addition, inflation is pushing prices upward resulting in
growing tax collections which is somewhat tempered by an expected modest decrease in spending.
The RTD forecast aligns with the statewide expectations from the Colorado Legislative Council
(CLC) and Office of State Budgeting and Planning (OSPB).

•

Operating grants of $141.7 million, primarily from the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), are a
recurring revenue stream to RTD. These grant apportionments are based upon financial and
statistical data that RTD submits to the National Transit Database (NTD). The FTA has agreed to
apportion amounts based on prior year NTD submissions excluding COVID-19 impacts and the

The financial aspects of a budget consist of three primary categories: revenues, expenditures and reserves.
Revenues and expenditures provide the cash inflows and outflows while reserves provide the financial
balance to smooth cash flow volatility and supply the financial relief necessary for unforeseen
circumstances that inevitably arise.

•

COVID-19 relief grants are anticipated to be fully drawn by the end of 2022. This additional grant
funding combined with strong sales and use taxes has contributed to an unprecedented balance
of over $1 billion in cash and investments as well as substantial reserves which, along with higher
interest rates, will generate additional investment income in 2023. These significant cash and
investment balances are earmarked for state of good repair needs and maintaining fund balances
in accordance with the RTD Fiscal Policy.

•

Other revenue includes recurring revenue of $16 million which consists primarily of a federal Build
America Bonds (BAB) interest rate subsidy and advertising revenues.

•

Interest income of $10 million is planned for 2023 with higher interest yields on higher reserve
balances.

Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA)/Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) increases the
annual apportionment to RTD approximately 30% in 2023 which is the equivalent of $27 million.
These increased apportionments are scheduled to continue through 2026.

Expenditures
Expenditures consist of both recurring expenses, such as operating expenses, as well as occasional outlays
such as projects, debt service and capital expenditures.
RTD’s largest expenditure is core business service delivery. These costs include compensation, materials
and supplies, contracted services, insurance, utilities and other such expenses.
RTD also has a significant debt burden primarily from capital expansion projects as well as obligations
issued to finance the purchase of rolling stock. RTD has completed two refinancings in the past year to
realize interest savings and reduce the debt burden. As interest rates have risen recently, RTD does not
anticipate performing additional refinancings during 2023.
Furthermore, RTD has ongoing asset management needs that average approximately $120 million
annually. Asset management needs can fluctuate significantly by year when, for example, a single year
includes a large purchase such as fleet replacements. The 2023 Proposed Budget contemplates these
periodic needs through building Capital Replacement Fund reserves until needed. RTD has the ability to
fund these purchases with cash, rather than more expensive lease-purchases that have been utilized in
the past, and has budgeted and forecasted accordingly.

•

Salaries and wages assume full staffing to provide service levels in accordance with the System
Optimization Plan (SOP). While it is anticipated that the job market will remain competitive and will
prolong RTD’s ability to attract and maintain full staffing levels, funding has been made available
in these appropriations. In addition, the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) includes wage
increases with provisions for incentive pay for represented employees until such time that adequate
staffing levels are achieved. The compensation increases in 2023 shown below are primarily driven
by annual increases and additional RTD police officers, which is partially offset by the decrease in
contracted security services included in Outside Services

•

Benefits include the following:
o A $1 million increase for represented employee health and welfare benefit increases
o A $3 million increase for non-represented health benefits due to an 8% premium increase
as well as realignment of the plan to provide a more attractive second option based on
benefits survey feedback from employees. The second option had shifted significant
premium costs from RTD to employees during the prior three years resulting in employee
dissatisfaction. While this increase is relatively immaterial, it follows no net increase in nonrepresented health and welfare costs in 2022 while also contributing to an increase in
employee satisfaction
o Dental and vision plans for employees remain largely unchanged for 2023, however, the
non-represented vision plan will shift to a new provider with no material change in cost
while also providing more options and flexibility for employees. This change resulted from
feedback received from employees through a benefits survey
o Represented employee retirement plans include RTD contributions to the defined benefit
pension of 15% with employee contributions remaining at 5% per the CBA. This plan will
be closed to new entrants in 2023. In addition, provisions have been included to fund the
new defined contribution plan at 9% with up to a 5% match for new employees beginning
January 1, 2023. The defined benefit pension plan is 82% funded, up from 53% funded in
2022, due to the 2022 one-time cash infusion of $160 million, and 2023 contributions are
not anticipated to change materially from 2022 while also maintaining adequate funding
levels
o The non-represented employee defined benefit pension plan is funded with a $15 million
contribution based on the unanimous recommendation from the Plan Trustees. The
actuarial recommended contribution for 2023 is $8.5 million, however, the Trustees
recognized the need to fund ongoing annual benefits of $10 million plus $5 million
representing the average annual lump sum withdrawals in order to avoid selling securities
in the existing down markets. This plan is 82% funded, up from 78% funded in 2022, and
currently has 143 active participants. This plan has been closed to new employees since
January 1, 2008 and funding requirements will tail off over the next several years
o The non-represented employee defined contribution plan assumes RTD funding of 9% of
wages which is the same amount contributed in 2022. Board policy is to contribute 7-9%
of wages each year. Only non-represented employees hired January 1, 2008 and thereafter
participate in this retirement plan
o RTD will continue to offer the 457(b) retirement plan to all employees except represented
employees hired in 2023 since they may contribute to the new defined contribution plan.

Expenditure assumptions for the Budget include:

1.D.1.c

Subject: 2023 Proposed Budget
Page

•

Materials and supplies consist of consumable items such as fuel, fluids and parts. Diesel fuel
purchases have been contracted at $2.94 per gallon for 7 million gallons, up from $2.30 per gallon
in 2022. Contracting fuel purchases provides budget certainty, particularly in the volatile fuel pricing
environment. Diesel and gasoline expenses typically account for 2% of operating expenses and the
increases will add approximately $4.5 million to these costs in 2023. This increase in cost is offset
by lower fuel usage cost savings in 2022 that will fall to the fund balance as well as a decrease in
budgeted parts costs resulting from lower trends, supply chain constraints and increased focus on
utilization of parts inventory

•

Services consist of contracted specialties within IT, legal and the security realm. Additionally, these
expenses contain inflationary increases which are offset by reductions resulting in a $6.1 million
decrease in 2023. The majority of the decrease is due to lower anticipated project activity as well
as a reduction in contracted security needs which will be replaced with RTD police officers. Project
activity is expected to be lower in alignment with current experience as well as people power and
supply chain challenges

•

Insurance costs have decreased over past years due to effective claims management. The 2023
budgeted costs include additional funding for commuter rail liability insurance coverage. While this
appears to be a net increase from 2021, insurance costs are relatively flat over an extended period
since 2022 commuter rail insurance was funded with a 15-month appropriation from 2021

•

Other expenses primarily contain expenditures for utilities and purchased transportation and, to a
lesser degree, various minor business expenses
o Utilities include projected amounts for traction power commensurate with planned rail
service levels and in alignment with 2022 usage
o Purchased transportation includes contractual increases and are aligned with expected
revenue service hours and contract amendments resulting from higher wages
o Outside Services includes $2m for design and project support for a battery electric bus
facility
o Travel and training and budgets have been maintained from 2022 to 2023 to contribute to
employee development and industry participation after elimination in 2020 and 2021.
Expenses for each Board Director have been budgeted at $10,000 per individual for travel
and $1,680 for telephone
o Funding for an on-call (“bench”) contract is included to address specialty consulting
engagements, if necessary
o A budget of $250,000 is available for employee engagement to be used for outreach and
recognition programs. All other discretionary spending will continue to be limited

•

Debt service represents a significant portion of RTD’s annual expenditures. Debt service consists
of principal and interest payments on bonds, certificates of participation (COPs) and lease-purchase
agreements. Debt service payments for 2023 will total $225.8 million, down from $235.2 million in
2022 as a result of refinancings for interest savings. The Base System bond payments will expire
in 2024, at which point, the Base System will be subject to the Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TABOR)

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
38th•Blake Development Negotiation

Committee Meeting Date:
November 1, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
November 15, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and/or her delegate to negotiate and
execute an Exclusive Negotiation Agreement (ENA) with Portman Holdings for the future lease and
development of the real property located at 3800 Wynkoop Street, Denver, Colorado (the Property).
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Chessy Brady, Transit-Oriented Development Manager, Planning
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD acquired the Property located at the corner of 38th Street and Wynkoop Street to serve as a Parkn-Ride (PnR) for the 38th•Blake Station on the A Line. The 4.5-acre Property is currently a 188-space
PnR, a large drainage facility, and a vacant, grass area. The Property is part of RTD’s parking
management system and is maintained by Denver Transit Operators (DTO) through the Concession
Agreement.
In 2010, the Board adopted the Strategic Plan for TOD to create a more focused policy that guides
RTD’s role in encouraging the creation of mixed-income communities near transit. In 2015, the Board
approved the Unsolicited Proposal Policy for Real Property, which guides the Unsolicited Proposal
Procedure (UPP) that developers must follow to pursue development on RTD property. Portman Holdings
submitted Step 1 of the UPP in April 2019, kicking off a conversation between the developer and
planning staff. Portman then submitted the second step of the UPP, the Technical Review, in July 2019.
A committee of Operations, Capital Programs, Safety, Security, and Planning staff found no fatal flaws
in the project and allowed the project to proceed. Portman soon submitted for Concept Review with the
City and County of Denver, receiving approvals in May 2021.
In August 2021, Portman submitted RTD’s formal Unsolicited Proposal for Joint Development. The multidepartmental committee reconvened and determined that Portman’s proposal had legal, financial, and
technical merit. Step 4 of the UPP requires RTD to release a Request for Alternative Proposals, which
staff did in the form of a Request for Qualifications (RFQ). RTD led the RFQ process with input from the
City and County of Denver. After a 90-day bid period, several weeks of deliberations and interviews, the
selection committee chose Portman Holdings based on their extensive development experience, access
to financial resources, and intent to provide greater affordability than required by local ordinance. To
continue to the next step in the UPP, RTD must execute an ENA with Portman Holdings.

Packet Pg. 42

1.D.2

DISCUSSION
This action authorizes the General Manager and/or her delegate to enter into an ENA with Portman
Holdings. In adopting this recommended action, the agency furthers the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan
priorities of Community Value, Customer Excellence, and Financial Success by creating much-needed
housing near transit, improving transit access, and generative revenues for RTD. The ENA will address,
among other items:
• Negotiation and design schedule
• Project financing
• Development plan (density, use, affordability)
• RTD Requirements
o Maintenance and operations
o Parking replacement
The ENA will permit a 24-month negotiation period, commencing on the effective date of the ENA.
However, RTD may extend the term of the ENA at its sole discretion.
Board authorization through a future action will be required to lease the Property to Portman Holdings
and begin construction. If RTD and Portman Holdings fail to execute the ENA, fail to successfully
negotiate a ground lease and any other necessary agreements, or if the Board does not authorize
disposition of the Property through a future action, RTD will remain the property owner and any
subsequent decisions about the Property would be subject to Board approval. RTD staff will keep the
Board apprised of the development process.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Approval of the ENA will have no financial impact to RTD.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Reimagine RTD Mobility Plan for the Future

Committee Meeting Date:
November 1, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
November 15, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to endorse the Reimagine RTD Mobility Plan for the Future (MPFF). Consistent
with the System Optimization Plan (SOP), the MPFF will be reviewed and updated with Board approval
periodically on a no-less-than triennial basis to provide for a consistent and effective coordinated policy
and vision for service.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Debra A. Johnson, General Manager and CEO
Brian T. Welch, AICP, Acting General Manager, Planning
Bill Sirois, Senior Manager, Transit Oriented Communities
PRESENTATION LENGTH
30 minutes
BACKGROUND
In 2018, RTD recognized that the landscape of surface transportation was in a state of flux and put in
motion several complementary efforts and initiatives. These efforts were collectively referred to as
“Transportation Transformation,” and included the following vision:
•
•
•

Transit systems need to make themselves more competitive now
It is time for a public transportation renaissance
The future of mobility depends on public transportation: practical, sustainable solutions that meet
the needs of everyone in the Denver metro area

The signature Transportation Transformation initiative became the Reimagine RTD project, and work
began in late 2019 to develop the MPFF and SOP. The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on
the completion of Reimagine RTD. While the original schedule called for completion by August 2021, the
project was paused mid-2020 in response to the global pandemic, and work resumed in January 2021.
In April 2021, the Board of Directors adopted the Reimagine RTD Guiding Principles. These principles are
guideposts, along with the Board-adopted Strategic Plan, for the MPFF.
A Technical Working Group (TWG) and Advisory Committee (AC) were formed at the start of the study
effort to provide input and guidance to staff and the consultant team throughout the study process.
Their contributions are reflected throughout the MPFF. The Board was also engaged throughout the
project effort and significant public input was gathered through in-person and virtual events.

Packet Pg. 54

1.D.3

Despite the global pandemic, the MPFF has adhered to the vision identified in 2018: RTD must be a
relevant part of the region’s mobility solutions, and the agency must address industry advancements and
societal shifts that are substantially altering how and when people travel, how cities function, and how
mobility options are factored into broader visions and goals.
DISCUSSION
The completed work products identify comprehensive, forward-thinking strategies to better connect
people to the places they want and need to go. The MPFF has been successful in addressing RTD’s
primary goals for the project and is fully aligned with the agency’s Strategic Priorities of Community
Value, Customer Excellence, Employee Ownership, and Financial Success:
•
•
•
•

Understand and document RTD’s long-range financial capacity
Identify RTD’s role in responding to 2050 travel demands
Clarify investment priorities
Engage and build consensus with stakeholders and partners

The MPFF work products include the following and should be considered together as the MPFF:
•

•
•

A printed Executive Summary, in 8.5x11 bound format, that will be distributed to the Board and
other interested parties (this is also available in digital format: http://slides.com/fhueng/reimaginertd/fullscreen#/lead-mobility-plan)
Attachment A to this report, which reflects the content of the Executive Summary, in a format
more compatible with Board packet distribution
An extensive online resource library, providing links to numerous MPFF deliverables

The online resource library includes in-depth documentation of MPFF work products, including those
cited herein, which can be found at the following address: http://slides.com/fhueng/reimaginertd/fullscreen#/home

Fiscal and Financial Scenarios
Scenario Planning
Zero Emission Conversion
Maintenance Facilities
Mobility as a Service and Mobility on Demand
Partnerships

District Boundaries

The overarching aspiration for Reimagine RTD is: “Moving everyone forward with solutions.” Key
highlights of the MPFF are presented by four opportunities, which are also aligned with the Strategic
Plan, describing RTD as follows:

Packet Pg. 55

1.D.3

•
•
•
•

Access: A mobility integrator that provides a regional transit backbone and partners with
stakeholders
Equity: A mobility provider prioritizing service to those most in need
Sustainability: A mobility leader that defines and evolves transit’s role through innovation and
collaboration
Financial: A mobility agency that is well-funded, financially stable and serves as a good steward
of taxpayer dollars while supporting regional access, equity, and sustainability

The presentation also includes an implementation plan, which is linked to Strategic Plan tactics and is
organized on a temporal and financial basis. Key implementation steps include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Implement a partnership program
Collaborate with Colorado Department of Transportation/local partners to implement regional bus
rapid transit service
Develop a zero-emission fleet transition plan
Integrate services and modes through development of a trip planning and payment platform
Continue to foster a dynamic, diverse workforce that attracts and retains valued people
Continue to seek opportunities to enhance transit safety
Initiate a formal effort to collaborate with state and local partners to increase transit funding in
the region

The MPFF articulates tactical, strategic, and policy initiatives that require subsequent action by the
Board and staff. Currently, the MPFF serves as the roadmap for those purposes but is not the vehicle for
immediate decision and action. It is therefore appropriate for Board action to endorse the MPFF and to
subsequently adopt specific actions.
The SOP Recommended Action included the following language related to future SOP updates: “with
such process to be informed and guided by any Board-adopted Mobility Plan for the Future (MPFF),
which SOP and MPFF will together be reviewed and updated with Board approval periodically on a noless-than triennial basis to provide for a consistent and effective coordinated policy and vision for
service.”
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with the Board’s endorsement of the MPFF.

Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Chris Quinn, Planning Project Manager
Carl Green Jr., Interim Director, Civil Rights Division
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
Since RTD implemented the most recent fare changes derived from the Pass Program Study
recommendations in 2019, the agency has received feedback from many customers and stakeholders
stating that current fares and pass programs are overly expensive and complicated. RTD is also
experiencing other changes that affect the outlook on fare policy. Like many other agencies in the United
States, there has been a consistent trend of declining ridership over the last several years. That trend
dramatically worsened due to impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic.
DISCUSSION
The Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis project began in December 2021. The project team has
now completed the third round of public engagement in which two detailed fare alternatives were
introduced for public review. Outreach efforts included:
• Community and customer meetings held in English and Spanish
• Customer survey in English and Spanish
• Press release and social media campaign
Additionally, the project team has conducted internal staff outreach and updates.
The presentation provides a description of the preliminary alternatives under consideration and a
summary of upcoming next steps.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact from this discussion item.
