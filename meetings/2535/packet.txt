Recommended Action
A.
Budget Transfer for SH 119 Bus Rapid Transit Environmental Clearance and Basic
Engineering
It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the RTD
Board of Directors approve a transfer of $3.5 million from the Planning expense grant
project budget to a new capital project for the SH 119 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT)
Corridor, which will permit staff to seek consultant services for assistance in the
preparation of National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review and Advanced Basic
Engineering services. A total of $1.5 million in funding for this project was approved in
the 2016 Amended Budget in the Planning expense grant budget, and the remaining
funds are planned for 2017 and 2018 in the 2017-2022 Strategic Budget Plan (SBP).
B.

Proposed Winter 2016/2017 Service Changes

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of
Directors approve the Winter 2016/2017 Service Change package as revised and
summarized in Attachment A resulting in an annualized cost savings of approximately
$1,337,000 and, further, to authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute
contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is impacted by
these changes.
C.
Authorization to enter into contract with Protran Technology for purchase of
Railway Worker Protection Early Warning System (16DR0003)
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to enter into a contract not to
exceed $1,500,000 with Protran Technology for the purchase of a Railway Worker
Protection Early Warning System and associated equipment (Contract Number 16DR003).
D.
Transfer FasTracks Sales and Use Tax Revenues in Excess of Forecasted Sales and
Use Tax Revenues to FasTracks Internal Savings Account
It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the RTD
Board of Directors approve transferring FasTracks sales and use tax revenues (.4%)
from unrestricted fund balance to the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) on an
annual basis when actual sales and use tax revenues (.4%) collected for the calendar
year exceed the forecasted sales and use tax revenues (.4%) projected in the adopted
budget each year. The actual sales and use tax revenues will be determined based on
the audited financial statements.

B. Review of 2016 Goals & Request for GM Self-Assessment (30 Minutes)
Committee Chair Francone reviewed the October 18th date that the selfassessment was due from GM Genova and asked if there were any questions on
the Goals that were approved in 2015 and sent for review in the GMO packet.
There were no questions on the 2016 goals and assessment due date.

C. Overview-Process and Timing of Evaluation Cycle (20 Minutes)

packet and outlined the schedule moving forward, noting that the second survey
Packet Pg. 5

6.A

would be sent in early October and the results would be available for review prior
to the meeting on October 25th. At that meeting, we will also review the final selfassessment submitted by General Manager Genova and discuss as needed.
Committee Chair Francone feels this meeting will have quite a bit of discussion.

discussion
 November 22nd: The full board will be invited to attend the GMO Meeting

E. Questions and Next Steps
Committee Chair Francone asked about the Benchmarking process and how we
would go about the process.
Director Bagley asked if we would have any new information to review since we
had just done a complete exercise last year when we were in the process of hiring
a new General Manager. Whether we get any concrete data or not we will have
the information for reference.
Barbara McManus said she felt she would have some additional information as she
had reached out to some of her counterparts through APTA. She also added that
this was a recommendation of the State Audit to review on an annual basis.
Director Anderson asked why we were using the TLRC for any type of Benchmark
and feels this is not reliable and would like Barbara to look into this further.
Director Bagley asked about the Self Evaluation and the timeline and if the
committee could have the assessment from General Manager Genova ahead of

time. He said if the General Manager were to prepare the self-assessment by
October 18th, the committee could review it prior to the meeting on the 25th. He
asked how the rest of the committee felt about that schedule.
General Manager Genova said that schedule would work for him. He said he
would prepare the evaluation for the 18th to be distributed and added to the
packet. The committee agreed.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Sep 27, 2016 3:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Committee Chair Francone said the committee would agree to that schedule and

C. Updates

• Planning Department
Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager of Planning, said General Manager
Genova wanted this update so that the Board could be informed on the key
activities for the Planning Department. He added that Bill Sirois and Brian
Welch will assist him with the presentation tonight.
Brian Welch, Senior Manager of Planning and Technical Services, stated that
the Southeast Rail Extension was the first project accepted into the Moving
Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21) New Starts Project
Development in 2013. He remarked that the SE extension moved into New
Starts Engineering in 2015, and reauthorization of the Fixing America’s
Surface Transportation (FAST) Act expedited approvals, resulting in a onetime $92 million grant in April of this year.
Bill Sirois, Senior Manager of Transit Oriented Communities, commented that
an independent consultant came in and performed a system wide
assessment of RTD’s Transit Oriented Development (TOD) and made
recommendations for moving forward. He added that staff has been
working on the recommendations in various forms over the past several
months. He noted that staff completed the North Area Transit Study (NATE)
earlier this summer and recommendations include a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT)
alignment from Brighton to the University of Colorado A line. He remarked
that the completion of this study allows local jurisdictions to plan for the
future and to reserve right-of-way.

6.B

Brian Welch remarked that another item staff has been working on is
documentation for Congress regarding new starts. He stated that the After
Study for the W line, and Before Study for the University of Colorado A line
are underway and commented that the purpose of the studies are to
document actual outcomes and monitor the accuracy of predicted outcomes
for the Federal Transit Administration (FTA).

Bill Van Meter stated RTD pursued multiple discretionary grants in 2016 and
noted there is an application that is currently under review. He added that
RTD helped the City and County of Denver with their Smart City Application,
and although it wasn’t successful, it did open the door to other programs.
Bill Van Meter stated RTD is looking to improve the Pass Program Study to
better serve our customers. He noted that staff wants to revisit and refine
the individual pass program goals, refine the pricing and administration of
each pass program and eventually recommend policy revisions to the Board
for adoption.
Bill Van Meter commented that staffs other planning efforts include:
 Denveright process
 Colfax Connections
 State Hwy 7 BRT
 Speer/Leetsdale Plan
 National Organization of City Transportation Officials (NACTO) South
Broadway Transit Accelerator Demonstration Project
 Rail~Volution 2017 Planning
 Interregional Connectivity Study
Bill Van Meter added that internally, staff is also working to identify and
eliminate waste while providing tools to innovate. The Continuous
Improvement Implementation is a strategic commitment plan to attract and
retain a dynamic workforce to improve communication and collaboration.
Committee Chair James thanked staff and commented that this was a lot of
information.
Chair Tobiassen noted one of the challenges for FasTracks was
overmatching. He asked staff to explain what exactly overmatching is, and
what makes it difficult.

Packet Pg. 10

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Oct 4, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Bill Sirois commented that the SH 119 BRT Budget Transfer was tabled at
last month’s Board Meeting, but staff is hopeful that the Board will approve
the transfer later this month. He stated staff has been working with the
City of Longmont to come up with a mutually agreed upon concept.

6.B

Chair Tobiassen commented that funds are limited because regions are
contributing more than the required 20% to be competitive.
Committee Chair James asked how much the local match was for the SE rail
extension. Brian Welch indicated the local match was 60%.
Director Bagley indicated he had sent General Manager Genova an email last
month discussing the new zoning for the City and County of Denver. He
said the entire Platte Facility was re-zoned and asked staff to come back at
the next committee meeting with a report on what is being proposed. Bill
Sirois commented that RTD staff had not been engaged with the City or
County regarding any re-zoning of RTD property. General Manager Genova
added that what Director Bagley is referring to might be a concept, but staff
will research this item.
Director Francone noted she did not see any mention of Jefferson County.
She indicted all of the plans seemed to only include Denver or Denver
County. She asked for a discussion off-line about Jefferson County plans,
and inquired about the Funding Advancements for Surface Transportation
and Economic Recovery Act (FASTER) Funds use.
Bill Van Meter stated that CDOT has a very well defined criterion as to how
FASTER funds are allocated. He added that RTD has always aligned
projects with CDOT’s priorities.
Director Francone asked if RTD has considered monetizing the innovations
that have come out of the Process Improvement Process. Bill Van Meter
stated it is difficult to quantify a dollar amount, but it is on staff’s radar.
Director Anderson said this is an excellent conversation that a former
finance manager at CDOT used to have about the color of money. She
noted it is important for the Board to understand the transportation planning
process from the bottom up. She said it begins with the city planners and
commissioners who decide what a city’s transportation needs are. She
added that all she is hearing is that funds are becoming more and more
Packet Pg. 11

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Oct 4, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Brian Welch explained that in 1989, the FTA introduced an initiative to
encourage local transit agencies to provide a greater local share for capital
projects. Known as overmatch, this larger local share was expected to
result in greater local flexibility in transit planning and additional
consideration in Federal review and decisions for capital project approvals.
He stated that on Small Starts projects, the Federal Government will pay up
to 80%, but that makes the local commitment of 20% or more much higher
than it has been previously. He added that Federal funds are extremely
competitive because projects that require fewer Federal dollars with a higher
local overmatch percentage are usually granted the funds they need.

6.B

competitive and Board members need to work within their own communities
because that is where it starts. She stated the Board needs to understand
how the money flows, where it comes from, what it is for, and where it
goes to.

Director Menten asked what RTD is looking to spend to host Rail~Volution
and requested that staff follow up with her off-line.
Committee Chair James inquired about what opportunities have been done
to provide the local match that would make the central rail extension occur.
He also asked about the acquisition of Burnham Yard, and contemplated if
Value Capture could assist with those two projects.
Bill Van Meter explained that the Central Rail Extension has been discussed
extensively, but in terms of Burnham Yard, staff has not had the chance to
review property values or other opportunities.
General Manager Genova stated that with the current status of RTD’s
financial condition, the cost associated with that kind of movement does not
fit in the current financial plan.
Committee Chair James remarked that RTD is cash short, but land rich and
encouraged staff to broaden their thinking in order to find other
opportunities.
Director Bagley commented that he supports Value Capture and stated it is
an option to enhance funds to the corridors that need to be completed. He
added that Value Capture should be studied as a much more possible
opportunity than previously considered.

D. Other Matters
There were no other matters.

Director Sisk stated that RTD has committed to hosting Rail~Volution next
year. He said this is a tremendous opportunity, but if any Directors have
concerns, they need to be flushed out early. Secondly, he stated he is
concerned with the current budget constraints and remarked that the Pass
Program needs to be integrated with the rest of the budget. He remarked
that the Board and Staff needs to focus on the current economic situation as
it appears it is not going to change drastically.

B. Recommended Actions

• Proposed Winter 2016/2017 Service Changes
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that
the Board of Directors approve the Winter 2016/2017 Service Change
package as revised and summarized in Attachment A resulting in an
annualized cost savings of approximately $1,337,000 and, further, to
authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute contract
amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is impacted
by these changes.
Motion:

Director Sisk made the motion to move this item
to the full Board at the October 25, 2016 Board
Meeting.
Director Deadwyler seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations,
communicated to the Board that staff had cancelled the
October 23rd service change. He stated there were a variety
of restructurings associated with rail changes, which would
not be implemented until later this year. He noted today, staff
will be discussing the winter 2016/2017 service changes.
Jesse Carter, Manager of Service Planning and Scheduling,
remarked that there were a total of 8 public hearings with 84
participants. He commented that the largest number of
inquiries were for Route 89 and the Highlands Ranch Call-nPacket Pg. 21

Bruce Abel noted that staff received a letter from the Douglas
County Commissioners and staff is currently considering a
new option. He stated staff communicated to Douglas County
that RTD could continue this service under a cost sharing
alternative, where Douglas County would fund half of the
costs associated with the Highlands Ranch Call-n-Ride. He
added that it is currently under review by the Douglas County
Commissioners and staff will update the Board when
additional information is available.
Director Deadwyler noted that the 89 has been problematic for
the past couple of years. She asked why this route was
removed from the service change schedule.
Jesse Carter stated after review of the subsidy level and
ridership numbers, this route is in the middle of the pack.
Director Bagley said this is the fourth time that the Highlands
Ranch Call-n-Ride has come up for discontinuance. He
commented that RTD has tried everything with regards to
marketing and working with local municipalities to promote the
service, but added if the community does not adopt the
service, it will not work.
Director Sisk commented that the Rockies Ride from Boulder is
being eliminated. He stated that all of the Directors need to
step up and put the needs of the Regional District ahead of
their own districts.
Director Hoy noted he had several calls about Route 31, but
stated the 31 is not included in the winter service changes.
Jesse Carter remarked that when people say the 31, they are
usually referring to the 31L. He noted that the 31L will
change once the G line is opened.
Director Menten asked if the winter service changes would
affect Access-a-Ride.
Jesse Carter indicated there would be no changes to Accessa-Ride, and none of the Access-a-Ride riders would be
affected.

• Authorization to enter into contract with Protran Technology for purchase of
Railway Worker Protection Early Warning System (16DR0003)
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that
the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to
enter into a contract not to exceed $1,500,000 with Protran Technology for
the purchase of a Railway Worker Protection Early Warning System and
associated equipment (Contract Number 16DR003).
Motion:

Director Lubow made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the October 25, 2016
Board Meeting.
Director Sisk seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Terry Emmons, Assistant General Manager of Rail Operations,
stated that the avoidance of work accidents and fatalities has
been in the spotlight for many years. He said that RTD’s
current policy relies on human notification, but the Early
Warning System can provide better, and more timely
warnings. He added that RTD received competitive bids, but
only two proposers met the specifications.
Director Bagley said it critical that the Board makes sure our
employees are safe. He stated that the Maintenance of Way
employees are important, and we need to send a message to
our patrons that the Board cares enough about staff to protect
them. He added that if our ridership does not think the Board
is taking care of its employees, what will they think about the
manner in which they are cared for. He asked his fellow Board
members to support this too.
Director Deadwyler agreed that employees need to be
protected. She noted her concerns with the University of
Colorado A line, and commented that this money might be

needed to fix issues with that line. She said employees need
to be safe, but light rail has been running for 23 years with no
issues.

Director Walker remarked that maintenance is critical for both
old and new systems. He added that one accident is one too
many and by passing this item, maintenance crews will be
able to operate more effectively with the better notification
system.
Chair Tobiassen said this is something that he has been
discussing for several years and asked why RTD did not have
this yet. He stated he would be supporting this item to
enhance the safety of RTD’s workers and to give them the
extra seconds they need to clear the tracks. He added that
anything the Board can do to enhance safety is imperative.
Director Lubow said she would be supporting this item. She
remarked that staff has been waiting to get this since 2011
because it kept getting pushed back in favor of other projects.
Committee Chair Anderson commented that she is the
daughter and granddaughter of rail road workers. She said
getting injured is always a possibility and anything the Board
can do to improve the safety of our workers should be done.
She said the cost of this contract does not compare to
someone’s life.
Director Sisk stated he had represented someone who had
been crushed between two trains, and that person lives in a
way that they had never imagined. He said he cannot be more
unequivocal about supporting this.

Packet Pg. 24

this should be tabled until next month.

C. Updates

• RTD Code of Conduct
Rolf Asphaug, General Counsel, said this is an advance preview of a
proposed Code of Conduct for RTD’s passengers. He stated that since RTD
has been in existence, it has not had a comprehensive code of conduct
governing behavior for passengers on RTD vehicles, facilities or property.
He added that other transit agencies have such codes which help passengers
understand what they can or cannot do. He stated that the codes help
passengers understand acceptable behavior and assist transit police and
staff communicate, and if necessary, enforce. He commented that the
attached code has been developed after review of codes by other peer
transit agencies, with input from Senior Leadership and other agencies. He
indicated that staff plans to bring this to the Board for approval at the
November 15th Financial Administration and Audit Committee, and for final
adoption at the November 22nd Board Meeting.
Steve Martingano, Transit Police Commander of Fare Enforcement
Operations, added that when people come to the Blake offices to complain,
staff cannot show anything in writing where it states what behaviors people
can or cannot do.
Mike Meader, Chief Security Officer and Assistant General Manager of
Security & Asset Management, stated the Code of Conduct will be used to
educate people so that everyone has a better experience when they ride the
buses or trains.
Director Bagley said it is imperative to adopt something like this. He added
that it is crucial to have, as it gives our employees something to stand
behind. He remarked that he has seen inappropriate behaviors and activities
on the Mall Shuttle and he thinks finalizing the Code of Conduct will be a
good step forward.
Director Deadwyler indicated that she is in favor of establishing a Code of
Conduct, but she is concerned as she does not want to add extra work for

the bus drivers. She added that she does not believe anyone on staff knows
how to recognize people with cognitive disabilities, and staff needs to be
able to identify those patrons.
Director Solano stated that until there is fare check consistency between
light rail and commuter rail, this Code of Conduct is presumptive.

Director Menten asked to sit down with staff offline to discuss a few
changes.
Chair Tobiassen stated that he was surprised that the Code of Conduct was
not already documented. He said there are a lot of disturbances on the 15L
that are problematic, and sometimes those situations escalate.
Director Hoy inquired about the Code of Conduct process going forward.
Rolf Asphaug remarked that staff anticipates bringing this back to the
Financial Administration and Audit Committee in November for approval, and
then to the November Board Meeting for final adoption.
Director Lubow commented that she attended a candidate forum hosted by
9 to 5, and some people there claimed that RTD Security profiled in its
enforcement. She said there were a lot of comments and it would be useful
to discuss those remarks.
Director Menten mentioned that the timeline Rolf presented was pushing this
item forward too quickly. She asked that this come back to the Board in
December after there has been public outreach efforts.
Director James commended staff for bringing this to the attention of the
Board.

D. Other Matters
Director Bagley reminded the Board that tomorrow, October 19th would be the last
day to complete the General Manager’s Survey. He indicated the survey takes a bit
of time to complete and asked those who had not submitted their survey to do so.
He noted the General Manager had a quarterly update press conference today and
stated it is imperative that the updates are on YouTube, or aired live so that the
public can see what RTD is doing. He added that this information should be for
everyone.

B. Recommended Actions

• Transfer FasTracks Sales and Use Tax Revenues in Excess of Forecasted
Sales and Use Tax Revenues to FasTracks Internal Savings Account
It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee
that the RTD Board of Directors approve transferring FasTracks sales and
use tax revenues (.4%) from unrestricted fund balance to the FasTracks
Internal Savings Account (FISA) on an annual basis when actual sales and
use tax revenues (.4%) collected for the calendar year exceed the
forecasted sales and use tax revenues (.4%) projected in the adopted
budget each year. The actual sales and use tax revenues will be
determined based on the audited financial statements.
Motion:

Director Lubow made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the October 25, 2016
Board Meeting.
Director Hoy seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Heather Copp, Chief Financial Officer and Assistant General
Manager of Finance and Administration, remarked that during
the process of adopting the 2016 Annual Program Evaluation
(APE) there were several comments about the FasTracks
Internal Savings Account (FISA). She stated that one of the
recommendations she received was to transfer additional
funds into the FISA to help build it up quicker. She
commented that overall, there would not be a significant
impact in a given year.

6.F

Director Anderson asked if service was going to be cut on
FasTracks corridors, could the FISA funds be used to cover
the costs that were needed.

General Manager Genova added that it would be challenging to
take funds from FISA and apply them to an already built and
operating corridor. He stated there would be a lot of
pushback, as FISA is for unfunded corridors.
Heather Copp remarked that the intent of this action item is to
build up the FISA account for the unfunded corridors.
Director Anderson asked staff to outline and define the
unfunded corridors. She stated that the Board needs to be
sure what the funds will be used for.
Director Lubow commented that this action item supports the
original intent of the FISA, which is to help the unfunded
corridors get funding. She added that the stakeholders want
to feel that their corridors are being addressed.
Director Bagley agreed with Director Anderson and stated it is
important to detail which corridors are considered unfunded.
He said there is a continued conversation and discussion about
stakeholders, but he was never approached and he has an
unfunded corridor. He added that there are four different
unfunded corridor extensions that are all important. He stated
that he is bothered by the fact that the North West corridor is
getting all of the attention. He remarked that all of the
corridors are important, but this action item is merely symbolic
as there will not be a lot of money added to this account at
one time. He further stressed that the funds in this account
could be moved out at any time by a future Board.
Director Deadwyler said she was on the Board when the FISA
was approved. She noted this needs to be revisited and reprioritized as any extra dime that goes into the account seems
to be going to the North West rail line. She commented that
Packet Pg. 30

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Oct 18, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Heather Copp stated that FISA funds can only be used for
construction, operations and maintenance of a FasTracks
project. She stated the answer to Director Anderson’s
questions is yes, but the Board would have to approve the
expenditure of the funds.

6.F

the Board should revisit and prioritize this, but she will not be
supporting this as it is.
Director Solano noted some of the corridors are receiving
federal grants while others are not. He said there is a financial
inequality between the corridors.

Director Hoy stated he is always amazed by the North vs.
South exchange. He said that the discussion on the table is
where extra funds might go, and if FISA is going to catch that
money. He stated that the outflow of FISA funds will be no
different than it is today. He added that the only reason the
Southeast Rail extension is being done is because RTD got a
good deal. The real question the Board needs to ask is if FISA
should catch the surplus funds, and not which corridor the
money will be applied to.
Director James said whatever the outcome is for this
resolution, he appreciates the efforts by staff to appease our
stakeholders and address their concerns.
Director Anderson commented that FasTracks money is
already earmarked for FasTracks and she would like to know
where those funds go.
Director Bagley stated there are other stakeholders, but this
action item was generated by conversations on the north side
of town. He said this needs to be holistic and other
stakeholders need to be recognized.
Committee Chair Menten noted the FasTracks bond measure
included language for bus service.
Heather Copp stated that bus service is already built into the
funding and financial model.
Director Deadwyler asked about the US36 BRT project and
asked what remained for that project.
Heather Copp commented that the circulator and Ranch Road
station were outstanding.

corridors, it would address the concerns from the other
Directors.

project, where would those funds come from.

C. Updates

• Sales and Use Tax Forecast Update
Heather Copp introduced Brian Lewandowski and Robert McNown from the
University of Colorado’s Leeds School of Business (CU Leeds) and stated
that they would walk the Board through the Sales and Use Tax Forecast
Update.
Brian Lewandowski, Research Associate, indicated that tonight’s
presentation would discuss the economy how CU Leeds developed the
model to the current forecast. He stated that Colorado is still in the top ten
for employment growth, and while energy is a large component of the
state’s economy, Colorado is well diversified. He added that all industries
are adding jobs, except for the mining and oil and gas sectors. Construction
is the fastest growing industry within the state, but there is a shortage of
workers. Growth continues to be slow and steady and balance sheets
continue to get stronger.
Robert McNown, Professor, remarked that the key variables between the
national economy and the local economy is employment. He added that the
Colorado economy has performed stronger than the national average both in
the long run, and in the recent economic recovery. He stated looking ahead,
forecasters will encounter uncertainty with Federal Policy, Europe, the
Middle East, Emerging Markets, commodity prices and the upcoming
election. He remarked that there will be frequent revisions of forecasts to
reflect new information as it is available. He stated in summary, factors
impacting the 2016-2017 revenues is:

• August 2016 Monthly Financial Status Report
Doug MacLeod, Controller, stated Sales and Use Taxes had a better month
in August. He added that RTD is $4 million below budget, but there was
$900,000 collected from internet taxes so there is new money coming in.
He commented that Ridership is down, but staff is seeing a bit of recovery.
Fare revenue was good in August, and it should be up again in September.
Director Lubow asked how RTD was able to benefit from the increase in
internet sales. Doug MacLeod explained that previously, an online retailer
only had to pay taxes if they were physically located within the district. He
noted in February of 2016, Amazon opened a distribution facility in the
District which allowed RTD to collect tax from the retailer. He noted that it
is a small piece, but it is tax that RTD was not collecting previously.
Director Bagley remarked that things are moving in the right direction since
August was good, and September will be better.

• SmartCard Project Update
Heather Copp recapped the last SmartCard Project Update, where she had
informed the Board that staff sent Xerox a Notice to Cure regarding the
Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliance. She stated that Xerox replied and
staff was happy with the majority of the responses. She noted that there
are a few outstanding items, but staff has met with Xerox’s VP of
Transportation and she has had weekly meetings with Xerox to discuss
outstanding issues. She added that staff hopes to have an update next
week on the status of the remaining concerns and she is hopeful that there
will be actions shortly.
General Manager Genova added that a Cure Notice is an incredibly big step
with any vendor as it is for all intents and purposes, a default notice.
Heather Copp commented that staff has been in conversations with King
Soopers and our equipment is currently in their test store. She stated that

King Soopers has had some concerns with the complexity of the equipment,
and staff is working with them to resolve any issues. She added that in the
meantime, staff is working with Safeway to get two stores set up with the
same test equipment.

Heather Copp stated staff now has a direct line to Xerox’s upper level
management, and hopefully, this will help us get the results we need. She
added that Xerox’s competitors have similar issues, so it would be
problematic to move to a new vendor at this time.
General Manager Genova remarked that he agrees with Heather’s
assessment. He noted that Xerox is concerned with their reputation and
they have involved their upper level executives with our project.
Director Lubow said there should be a drop dead date for the SmartCards to
prevent the project from continually progress with no real finalization.

• Fiscal Sustainability Update
Heather Copp noted that the Fiscal Sustainability Update was included in the
October 28, 2016 Financial Administration and Audit Packet and asked if
the Board had any questions.
Director James asked for a status update on parking.
General Manager Genova remarked that staff would be bringing forth an
analysis of a universal parking program for review at next month’s Financial
Administration and Audit Committee. He stated that the premise is to
provide RTD with a parking philosophy and policy.

• 2017 Requested Budget Update
Jannette Scarpino, Senior Manager of Budget and Financial Analysis, stated
that long-term fiscal stability is key if RTD is to deliver the services and
programs of the mission statement in a cost-effective manner. She added
that RTD must maintain debt service coverage and remain within Taxpayer
Bill of Rights (TABOR) debt limits. She remarked that there will be no
service reductions necessary to balance the budget in 2017, and Operating
expenses will be controlled within Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) control totals.
She reiterated that only the minimum and must have Capital and expense
projects will be completed, a new unrestricted operating reserve will be
established for the first time, and no new debt will be issued.
Director Bagley mentioned that he spoke to Gary Thomas, President and
Executive Director of Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART). He indicated that
Packet Pg. 34

Director Hoy indicated he was curious about the Notice to Cure, and what
position we are in now because of it.

6.F

DART assessed their revenue forecast lower than what was projected and in
doing so, they were in better financial shape. He stated that RTD’s sales
and use tax was at 5.6% and asked if staff would be more comfortable if
that amount was adjusted lower.

D. Other Matters
There were no other matters.

October Board Meeting Agenda Review
Motion:

Director Hoy made the motion to

Board Agenda to the full Board.
Director Deadwyler seconded the motion.

Chair Tobiassen provided the initial review of the agenda and indicated one item
that had been tabled was being brought forward and there were three additional
recommended actions. Chair Tobiassen noted there were no retirees for the
month of October.
Director Francone outlined her update on the GM Oversight and Performance
Management Committee meeting schedule including that the GM performance
survey has been completed with 11 directors participating. The next meeting
for of the Committee is scheduled for October 25th.
GM Genova mentioned at this point that he apologizes for getting the final SelfAssessment to the GM Oversight and Performance Management Committee late
but it was forwarded earlier in the day Barbara McManus.
Barbara McManus said she had received the assessment and has already
forwarded to the Committee via e-mail just before this meeting.
Chair moved onto Recommended Actions and asked for questions or comments.

General Manager Genova said we were already engaged with LYFT and he is
interested in what they have to offer. The pilot program in Centennial “Go
Centennial” will give valuable information to help us move forward.
Director Deadwyler stated she has tried to engage with LYFT and UBER, but they
are not readily available in her area and are not equipped with lifts.

General Manager Genova gave a detailed overview of the status of the A, B & G
lines and the temporary waiver that was in place. He said he and his team would
be meeting with the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) with an action plan for
the grade crossings. RTD and DTP have brought in additional resources that are
working on an assessment and staff is looking forward to the results of the
assessment. General Manager Genova added that he has been speaking the CEO’s
of all the partners involved in the concessionaire agreements and he will keep the
Chair aware of the continued dialog and the outcome of his meetings.
Director Hoy asked if under the present scenario was safety an issue.
General Manager Genova said the FRA has been making frequent visits and have
made some recommendations, as there is always room for improvement.
Director Hoy asked why the FRA would not give us approval to test the G line as
the window of testing time is so slim.
General Manager Genova said currently, the FRA has drawn a line in the sand and
we have to follow their lead in this decision.
Director Deadwyler asked about the plan that we were presenting and what that
meant to the current waiver schedule.
General Manager Genova said we do not know how the FRA might proceed with
extending or granting a new waiver and said there are certain milestones that will
need to be met before any extension or new waiver would be issued.
Director Deadwyler mentioned that she had received some calls regarding accidents
that have occurred at the crossings and wanted to know what was being done to
avoid the problem in the future.

6.G

General Manager Genova said the flaggers are being evaluated on a daily basis and
that he would look into the accidents to see what the causes were.
General Manager Genova spoke about the Press conference on Tuesday and the
format that was used and that they will continue to move forward in being
transparent. All materials were provided to constituents, the press and our
government relations contractors to get the word out. He mentioned that we can

Public Participation
Chair Tobiassen stated public participation was open to anyone that wanted to address the
Board. He reminded the audience that each speaker is allowed three minutes.
 George Gerstle, Boulder, indicated he was the Transportation Director for Boulder
County. He said Boulder County appreciates that RTD remains committed to
funding of the SH119 BRT; the highest priority BRT corridor agreed to in the RTD
Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS) consensus agreement. He added that
Boulder County also understands RTD is having the fiscal challenges associated
with lower than projected sales tax revenues and higher than projected costs for
the FasTracks system. He added that Boulder County appreciates and supports
staff’s recent recommendation to retain the FasTracks Internal Savings Account
(FISA) in order to demonstrate a commitment to complete the FasTracks program.
He remarked that the elimination of the FISA would preclude completion of the
remaining unfunded portions of the FasTracks system until 2030 or beyond. He
urged the Board to take a more gradual approach to re-filling depleted reserve
accounts in order to mitigate the immediate impact of the proposed redirection of
funding and commit to deposit any FasTracks related revenue received over the
forecast revenue in the FISA account in order to demonstrate RTD commitment to
the completion of FasTracks. He stated Boulder County was also very concerned
with the proposed redirection of the vast majority of any new base system
operating revenue to FasTracks operations and maintenance starting in the early
2020’s. He said that such an action would eliminate increases in non FasTracks
service necessary to address the region’s growing population that relies on the base
system RTD bus service and it would eliminate the possibility of any significant

future growth in bus service for the next decade, or longer and it will have a
disproportionate impact on the region’s residents not currently served by
FasTracks. He remarked that zeroing out funding in FISA combined with the
proposed use of additional revenue growth in base system funds to subsidize
FasTracks operations seems to eliminate any opportunity to complete FasTracks
and any opportunity to expand non-FasTracks service necessary to meet the
regions’ growing population for more than a decade by the proposed action. He
further stated that our citizens expect us, as leaders of the metro region, to work
together to come up with reasonable political and financial solutions to complete
the FasTracks system the voters approved in 2004, without sacrificing the base
bus system that so many people rely on. Boulder County does not believe it is
acceptable to our residents to wait at least another decade for completion of
FasTracks, or to forgo any substantial growth in the base bus system service in
order to funds operations of the current FasTracks system. He added that Boulder
County stands committed to work with RTD to resolve this difficult situation.
Doug Gragg said that it has been two months since he has spoken in front of the
Board. He stated on July 4th, he was riding the H Line south, to the Broadway
station. He remarked that he was hassled by juveniles for money and feeling that
he had no other alternatives, he gave them what he had. He said that the train
came to a sudden stop and the train operator came out of the Operator’s cab and
demanded that the juveniles return the money they had taken. Mr. Gragg said that
the operator, Lorenzo Johnson did an excellent job of looking out for, and taking
care of an older person who felt threatened.
Véronique Bellamy, Longmont, recommended that RTD develop a customer ticket
system to resolve complaints. She said people call the Call Center with their
issues, but they do not know what RTD is doing to address their concerns. She
stated RTD needs to update its IT software to an Application Program Interface
(API). She added that she still has four Colorado Open Records Act (CORA)
requests that have yet to be fulfilled and the API could address her requests in a
timely manner. Lastly, she recommended that Director Bagley re-introduce his
motion to have the RTD Board and Committee meetings recorded for transparency.
Wayne Graham, Denver, said that the City of Denver has a noise ordinance which
requires lower noise levels from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. He said that trains depart Union
Station for Denver International Airport (DIA) beginning at 3:15 a.m. and the trains
have to cross through multiple streets all the while blowing a loud horn. He
recommended that RTD run busses along the University of Colorado A line from
10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. until the quiet zone certifications are completed.
Karen Stuart, Broomfield, indicated she was here tonight to represent the North
Area Transportation Alliance (NATA). She said that NATA appreciates staff’s
recommendation to retain the FISA under the modified base scenario in order to
demonstrate a commitment to FasTracks. However, she said that the Board needs

to seek alternatives that retain the existing funds and increase the FISA for the
construction of FasTracks. She remarked that it was not acceptable to residents to
wait two more decades for the completion of FasTracks as it will likely be costprohibitive to complete any additional corridors in 2040. She asked the Board not
to approve the 2016 Annual Program Evaluation (APE), but if they did, she asked
that they go on the record noting their concerns and desire to complete FasTracks
by 2022. She asked that staff:
1. Begin working with affected jurisdictions with unfunded FasTracks corridors
to develop viable segments along corridors that can be built between now
and 2022;
2. Involve local jurisdictions early to work together on the 2017 APE; and
3. Commit any FasTracks revenues that exceed the projected forecasts to be
put into the FISA account for construction in order to truly demonstrate
RTD’s commitment to complete FasTracks.
She said the Board needs to demonstrate to the region that RTD has not given up
and asked that the Board vote “no” on the 2016 APE, or “yes” with strong
concerns and direct staff to proceed with the three points outlined above.
Erik Hansen, Adams County, said that he sympathizes with the Board because
often people complain, but they do not offer any alternative solutions. He asked
the Board not to approve the APE tonight as RTD made a commitment to the voters
to complete FasTracks. He remarked that RTD should evaluate service levels and
examine alternatives.
Barry Gore, Adams County, asked the Board to vote against the APE and to keep
the funds in the FISA account. He said that the Board made very difficult decisions
in 2012, and if RTD were to remove the FISA it would kill off any private
partnerships and unsolicited proposals. He remarked that the metro Denver area is
well known internationally, and it would be tragic for FasTracks to get a black eye.
He stated that this decision does not need to be made tonight, and he asked staff
to re-evaluate all of the alternatives.

Director Menten said she disagrees with some of the funds RTD has spent on sponsoring

General Manger Genova stated Civil Rights, for example, is challenged to meet with the
public and coordinate outreach efforts. He added that Civil Rights uses their budget as
they see fit to accomplish community outreach.
Director Menten commented that when RTD does not have all of the capital it needs to
complete projects it is improper to spend taxpayer money for awards dinners and galas.
Director Solano remarked if the Board wants to save money, we should re-evaluate RTD’s
participation in the American Public Transportation Association (APTA).

Discussion and Action of the 2016 Annual Program Evaluation (APE) and Financial

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD
Board of Directors adopts the 2016 Annual Program Evaluation (APE) and Financial
Plan as outlined below.
Motion:

Director Deadwyler made the motion to approve
the 2016 Annual Program Evaluation (APE) and
Financial Plan.
Director Bagley seconded the motion.
Director Hoy stated he would be voting against
this item. He said he still has concerns about
this and requested that staff have further
discussions with stakeholders in the north.
Director Lubow said she too would be voting
against this item.
She remarked that she
represents an unfunded corridor and it seems
that the unfunded corridors are asked to bear
the burden of the financial decisions that benefit
the rest of the district. She added that she
appreciated Commissioner Hensen’s suggestions
to look for alternative funding.
Chair Tobiassen asked Heather Copp to speak to
the Board regarding this item.

Heather Copp, Chief Financial Officer and
Assistant General Manager of Finance and
Administration, said if the Board did not pass
this item tonight, staff will have to cancel the
Certificates of Participation (COP’s) next month.
She added that staff will have an issue with
being able to issue bonds, and staff would have
difficulty paying the bills for the rest of the year.
She noted that all of the current projects be
slowed down because she would not be able to
pay the bills.
Henry Stopplecamp, Assistant General Manager
of Capital Programs and Facilities added that if
the APE is not passed, RTD would have to
extend all of its contracts, which would cost the
Agency more money.
Rolf Asphaug, General Counsel, stated an
affirmative vote of 8 is required to pass this
item.
Director Bagley said if conversations are to be
had, they need to include every corridor. He
added that the FISA account is not just for the
north, and everyone needs to understand that.
He remarked that the modified baseline scenario
does not close the FISA account, but it utilizes
the money.
Director Folska commented that she agrees with
Director Bagley.
She appreciates everything
she’s heard tonight, but delaying issuing bonds
would be a huge setback for the district. She
believes FasTracks can be finished by 2020 and
asked the General Manger to provide his
assurances that alternative funding will be
sought and asked that the passenger/freight
relationship be examined further.

Director James commented that it would be
unfair to treat any corridor with any priority over
the others.
He said he understands staffs
concerns about the disruption if this is not
passed, so he would be voting yes.
Director Walker said he would be supporting this
motion. He said the entire Board is committed
to completing every corridor, but we must
support the whole system. He remarked that
maintaining the viability of the system and
paying debts is the most important.
Director Deadwyler said if this is voted down,
that means we will not be paying our
contractors.
She remarked that she cannot
support this.
Director Sisk commented that the Board needs
to challenge staff to examine alternative funding
sources.
Chair Tobiassen said if this item were to be
voted down, it would severely impact RTD’s
services. He remarked that this is a business
decision because of the potential harm it could
cause our riders. He added that it would be a
sad day when RTD cannot pay its bills and finish
projects it has committed to. He asked the
Board to approve this item, and to continue to
work with our partners to find solutions to
complete FasTracks sooner rather than later.

Director Lasater said with the remodeling of the Civic Center Station, our constituents are
standing out in the rain, and soon to be snow. He stated if any Board members know City
Council members, to please tell them that the ridership needs some sort of bus shelter. He
remarked that the previous shelters have been displaced and we cannot leave it up to
politics and leave people out in the cold. He added that Civic Center will be under
construction for 12-18 months and this needs to get done sooner, rather than later.
Director Bagley said there was an interesting conversation about the APE, and tabling the
BRT for state Hwy 119 tonight. He remarked that these conversations only demonstrated
the pennywise and pound foolish perspective of the Board. He noted the Mobility Choice
effort would relate mobility with RTD’s constituents, but the Board is being foolish about
expenditures. He stated he would like to see the Mobility Choice action item come back
to the Board.
Director Francone said she too had received comments from constituents regarding snow
at Civic Center and asked for shelter options to be presented. Secondly, she stated that
all of the Directors need to think outside of their districts to see what is best for the
region. She noted it is difficult for staff, but solutions need to be found to fund the
unfunded corridors. She remarked that staff needs to look at revenue streams outside of
the Agency.
Director Folska recognized Erin Klass for all of her work during her time in the Board
Office. She said that Erin has always performed in an outstanding and professional

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors approve a transfer of $3.5 million from the Planning expense grant project budget to a new
capital project for the SH 119 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Corridor, which will permit staff to seek
consultant services for assistance in the preparation of National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)
review and Advanced Basic Engineering services. A total of $1.5 million in funding for this project
was approved in the 2016 Amended Budget in the Planning expense grant budget, and the remaining
funds are planned for 2017 and 2018 in the 2017-2022 Strategic Budget Plan (SBP).
BACKGROUND
RTD initiated the Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS), in April 2013. The purpose of the study
was to develop consensus among RTD, the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) and the
Northwest-area stakeholders, including local jurisdictions and businesses, on cost effective and
efficient mobility improvements to serve the Northwest area. On June 24, 2014, the Board approved
a resolution which accepted the Final Consensus Statement as developed by the NAMS stakeholders
for priorities within the Northwest Study Area. One of the highest priorities, as described in the
Final Consensus Statement, was to proceed into advanced planning, environmental clearance and
preliminary engineering to establish Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) in the SH 119 Corridor from Longmont
to Boulder.
As part of the 2040 Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) process, the Denver Regional Council of
Governments (DRCOG) included the SH 119 BRT Corridor in the Fiscally Constrained 2040 RTP.
Inclusion of the corridor in the RTP is required before National Environmental Planning Act (NEPA)
clearance can be completed.
In order to advance this effort, DRCOG awarded RTD $1 million in Congestion Mitigation / Air
Quality grant funds for Fiscal Year 2016 to further environmental planning and engineering efforts in
the corridor. RTD would need to obligate these funds by September 2017 or risk losing the funding
to another project.
The cost to establish BRT in the corridor is estimated to be approximately $57 million in 2013
dollars. Staff assumes that grants will provide funding for approximately half of this cost. The
Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) includes $60 million in Base System funds (with $30 million assumed to
be from grant sources) for construction of the corridor beginning in 2022.
This action fits within the General Manager Goal to Improve Service Delivery, specifically the sub
goal of enhancing or expanding operations, as the eventual completion of BRT in the SH 119 corridor
will increase service reliability, ridership and cost effectiveness of the service.

Packet Pg. 55

12.A

DISCUSSION
RTD will require extensive consultant services to complete the NEPA environmental clearances and
basic engineering prior to BRT construction in the SH 119 Corridor. Staff estimates those consultant
services to cost $3.5 million. RTD has received $1 million in DRCOG grant funds for Fiscal Year
2016 for this effort, with RTD providing the remainder of the project cost. Staff expects the effort
to span approximately 2.5 years, and these funds were programmed in the 2016 expense budget
and in the years 2017 and 2018 in the 2017-2022 SBP to match the anticipated project schedule.
However, the full contract amount must be appropriated up front in order to issue a Request for
Proposals (RFP) because the project is a capital project. The budget transfer will allow staff to issue
an RFP for consultant services in November 2016 and award the contract in February, 2017. Based
on the 2.5 year schedule described above, the environmental clearances and basic engineering would
be completed by July 2019.
Should RTD pursue BRT construction in this corridor, as prioritized by the NAMS Final Consensus
Statement, the SH 119 BRT project would be subject to approval by a two-thirds vote of the RTD
Board. In addition, DRCOG SB 208 approval would be required as this project would be defined as a
rapid transit corridor project. The expectation is that the funding breakdown for future BRT
construction in the corridor would be as follows:



50 percent from RTD Base System Funds; and
50 percent from grant sources, such as DRCOG Transportation Improvement Program (TIP)
funds, and/or Federal Transit Administration (FTA) Small Starts funding.

Project construction would occur within the 2022 to 2025 timeframe. And, as noted, future Board
action would be required to approve construction of BRT in this corridor.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The funding that will be used for this project is available from projects funds rolled forward from 2015 to
2016 that are no longer required for that purpose and are available for this priority. Because these funds
were programmed in 2017 and 2018 SBP, funds will be made available in those years by funding the
project now.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit
Committee that the RTD Board of Directors approve a transfer of $3.5 million from the
Planning expense grant project budget to a new capital project for the SH 119 Bus Rapid
Transit (BRT) Corridor, which will permit staff to seek consultant services for assistance in
the preparation of National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review and Advanced Basic
Engineering services. A total of $1.5 million in funding for this project was approved in the
2016 Amended Budget in the Planning expense grant budget, and the remaining funds are
planned for 2017 and 2018 in the 2017-2022 Strategic Budget Plan (SBP).
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not approve the requested budget transfer at
this time. Instead, include this request as part of the 2017 Recommended Budget. This
action is not recommended since it will delay the procurement of consultant services for the
SH 119 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) corridor by at least two months.
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not approve the requested budget transfer;
instead wait until the full $3.5 million for consultant services is available in 2018 on the
schedule included in the SBP. This action is not recommended since it would delay

Packet Pg. 56

12.A

procurement of consultant services for the SH 119 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) corridor until early
2018 and would likely delay future construction of the corridor, thereby subjecting
construction to cost escalation. This action would likely cause the forfeiture of the $1 million
in DRCOG TIP funds, which were awarded to advance the NEPA / Basic Engineering effort in
the corridor, which would increase RTD’s local funding required to advance the project.
4. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not approve the requested budget transfer and
do not proceed forward with procuring consultant services to assist staff in the preparation of
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review and Advanced Basic Engineering services for
the SH 119 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) corridor. This action is not recommended given the
considerable commitment on the part of RTD and the Northwest Area stakeholders to reach
the consensus prioritizing SH 119 as the highest-priority BRT corridor in the Northwest Area.
Furthermore, this action would require RTD to forfeit $1 million in DRCOG TIP funds, which
were awarded to advance the NEPA / Basic Engineering effort in the corridor.

Proposed Winter 2016/2017 Service Changes

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the Winter 2016/2017 Service Change package as revised and summarized in Attachment A
resulting in an annualized cost savings of approximately $1,337,000 and, further, to authorize the
General Manager or his designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators
whose service is impacted by these changes.
DISCUSSION
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. We will continue adjusting services in
response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. It is also
our responsibility to identify services that are underperforming and recommend modifications,
curtailment or cancellation of service as warranted. The proposals herein include a mix of service
adjustments and reductions. Based upon current and past ridership performance Route 116 Limited is
proposed to be discontinued. Also related to its ridership performance, the Highlands Ranch Call-n-Ride
is proposed to be continued contingent upon discovery of alternative funding from sources outside RTD.
Additionally, service reductions on the W Line (light rail) are proposed in an effort to match the level of
service and expense to current ridership demands. We will monitor customer response to the
implementation of these service changes and propose adjustments and service alternatives as
appropriate in future service change recommendations.
The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
 Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
 Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
SUMMARY OF PUBLIC HEARINGS
Eight public hearings were held in Aurora, Brighton, Denver, Highlands Ranch, Ken Caryl, Lakewood, and
Stapleton Denver at the Blake Administration building. Comments and further details from these
meetings and the service change website are summarized in Attachment B of this report.
CHANGES TO INITIAL RECOMMENDATIONS
Staff receives input during the public comment process and continues to conduct additional analysis
after the initial service recommendations are communicated to the Board of Directors. Depending on the
outcome of the public comment process and continued analysis, staff may or may not propose
modifications to these initial recommendations. The following proposals have been significantly modified:
Route 89 – Stapleton/Anschutz Campus: the proposal to discontinue this route has been rescinded.

Packet Pg. 58

12.B

Highlands Ranch call-n-Ride: the proposal to discontinue the Call-n-Ride, has been modified and is
contingent upon funding alternatives.
SUMMARY OF PROPOSED SERVICE CHANGES

Routes proposed for service reductions:

Route 40 – Colorado Boulevard: discontinue the 6:32pm northbound trip from Colorado Center
Route 89 – Stapleton/Anschutz Campus: proposal to discontinue service rescinded
Route 116L – Ken Caryl Limited: discontinues service on the Route 116L, due to very low ridership.
Route 169L – Buckley Road/Denver Airport: discontinue 7:10pm southbound trip daily and 5:10pm southbound
trip on Saturday and Sunday only.
Highlands Ranch call-n-Ride: continue the Call-n-Ride, contingent upon alternative funding
RockiesRide: discontinue all but two RockiesRide bus services
W Line (FasTracks): discontinue 16 Monday-Friday trips in the AM and PM peak periods

Routes proposed for mixed service improvements/service reductions:
Route 324 – Main Street Crosstown: reroute of service currently on St. Vrain School District property
Route R/RC/RX – Brighton/ Denver; Brighton/Denver Express: renaming of route
Routes proposed for routine running time analysis/schedule adjustments
Route 15 – East Colfax: running time analysis
Rail Lines proposed for routine schedule adjustments:
Minor running time adjustments are proposed for all light rail lines: C, D, E, F, H, and W Lines, on all
service days.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The overall financial impact contained in this proposal includes a cost reduction of $962,000 from
FasTracks and $375,000 cost saving from the base system, for a total savings of approximately
$1,337,000 annualized.
EQUITY ANALYSIS
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and
Executive Order 12898 regarding Environmental Justice. In this circular, the FTA requires RTD to
evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that exceed the established major service
change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a disproportionately negative impact on
minority or low-income populations. Our evaluation of the proposed Winter 2016/2017 service changes
does not reveal any disparities in impacts absorbed by minority or low-income populations.
A Look Ahead – May 2017
L – Line
A proposed solution to D Line on-time performance issues and consequentially, overall light rail system
performance, this proposal introduces a modification to current D Line operations. The L Line adds a
new 30th& Downing to 14th Street Loop (Downtown) movement, replacing the D Line service between
30th & Downing Station and 19th Street. More extensive information regarding this proposal will be made
available in a future update to the Board of Directors.

Attachment A – Winter 2016

Bus

Route 40 – Colorado Boulevard
It is proposed to discontinue the 6:32pm northbound trip from Colorado Center, which is
not needed to maintain 15 minute frequency on the Route 40. Cost savings are expected
to be an estimated $8,000 annualized.
Route 44 – 44th Avenue
It is proposed to reroute the current service to use Clayton Street to 40th Avenue in the
place of the current Steele Street routing to improve sight lines at the rail road crossing of
the University of Colorado A Line. No operation cost impacts are anticipated.
Route 89 – Stapleton/Anschutz Campus
The proposal to discontinue service on the Route 89 has been rescinded, due to new
ridership and financial information.
Route 116L – Ken Caryl Limited
This proposal discontinues service on the Route 116L, due to very low ridership. The route
currently averages less than 5 passengers per trip and 6 passengers per hour, which falls
below the service standard of 6.5 for a Suburban Local service. Alternatives to this service
can be found the use of Route 21 in the Bear Creek area and Green Mountain Call-n-Ride.
Anticipated cost savings are estimated to be $90,000 annualized.
Route 169L – Buckley Road/Denver Airport
This proposal discontinues the 7:10pm southbound trip weekday and weekends. This trip
averages 5 passengers per day. It is also proposed to discontinue the 5:10pm southbound
trip on Saturday and Sunday only, which averages 6 passengers per trip. Anticipated cost
savings are estimated to be $25,300 annualized.
Route 324 – Main Street Crosstown
Due to routing currently being on St. Vrain School District property and the request
of Silverthorne High School to remove the current terminal from school property, it
is proposed to reroute the Route 324 and locate a new west-end terminal at
Grandview Meadows Drive and Nelson Road, northbound, nearside Nelson Road.
No additional operational costs are anticipated.
Route R/RC/RX – Brighton/ Denver; Brighton/Denver Express
It is proposed to convert 3 PM peak north-bound and 2 AM peak southbound R
trips into RX trips and rename the route to RC/RX only. The renaming will provide
clarity in the route designation after the introduction of the new light rail R Line
service. No additional operational costs are anticipated.

Route 15 – East Colfax
This proposal supports routine schedule adjustments on the Route 15, which are
anticipated to cost $41,000 annualized.

12.B.a

Highlands Ranch call-n-Ride
In November 2006, the Highlands Ranch Call-n-Ride began service. The Call-n-Ride
operates Monday-Friday 6:00am – 6:00pm. Despite numerous marketing
campaigns and adjustments to the Call-n-Ride boundary, the Call-n-Ride falls in the
lowest category of boarding’s per hour and highest subsidy cost per boarding’s.
Our most recent ridership data show the Call-n-Ride at 2.5 boarding’s per hour.
Staff recommends the continuation of this service be contingent upon the receipt of
$94,085 (50% of the operating cost) from sources outside of the RTD. Alternative
service includes Routes 402L and 403. If alternative funding is not provided the
anticipated cost savings are estimated to be $188,170 annualized.
RockiesRide
With the major changes in transit corridors within the RTD, it is recommended that
many of the buses used for RockiesRide be redeployed to backup existing service
on Rockies game days in 2017. Rockies service for 2016 included opening day,
Saturday, Sunday and all fireworks games. The following changes are
recommended for the 2017 season:
 RockiesRide Route 36R / Wadsworth-Hampden – this route would be
discontinued and no replacement offered as ridership averages only 5
boardings per bus.
 RockiesRide Route 55R / Olde Town Arvada – this service would be
discontinued, as an alternative; customers can use the new G Line, which
will be operating with service to Union Station.
 RockiesRide Route 86R / US36 & Broomfield – this service would be
discontinued, as an alternative; customers can use Flatiron Flyer service to
Union Station. Back up buses will be available.
 RockiesRide Route 120R / Wagon Road-Thornton – Route to remain the
same – no changes.
 RockiesRide Route BR / Boulder High School, US36 & Table Mesa Station,
US 36 & McCaslin Station – this service would be discontinued, as an
alternative; customers can use Flatiron Flyer service to Union Station.
Backup buses will be available.
 RockiesRide Route LR / Longmont – Route to remain the same – no
changes.
Cost savings are anticipated to be an estimated $104,700 annualized.

Rail
W Line (FasTracks)
It is proposed to discontinue 16 Monday-Friday trips in the AM and PM peak periods:
Eastbound trips from Federal Center Station at 6:16 AM, 6:46 AM, 7:16 AM, 7:46 AM,
8:16 AM, 8:46 AM, 4:01 PM, 4:31 PM, 5:01 PM, 5:31 PM, and 6:01 PM and Westbound
trips from Union Station at 5:27 AM, 5:57 AM, 6:25 AM, 6:55 AM, 7:25 AM, 7:55 AM,
3:10 PM, 3:40 PM, 4:10 PM, 4:40 PM, 5:10 PM, and 5:40 PM. This proposed change

or later. Three-car trains will be reapportioned to adjust for crowding on trains to meet
Service Standards.

The peak vehicle requirement for the W Line service would be reduced from 23 cars to 16
cars, which helps improve the spare ratio, which will be below our standard when the I225 Rail Line opens.
The anticipated cost savings are estimated to be approximately $962,000 annualized.
Rail Lines proposed for routine schedule adjustments:
Minor running time adjustments are proposed for all light rail lines: C, D, E, F, H, and W
Lines, on all service days. This is based on new data received from adjusting the
scheduled timepoints, which allows for a more thorough running time analysis. Running
time will only change between 15 and 30 seconds and only between a few stations on
each line. This will not alter the light rail trips and the same service will be provided. No
changes in hours are anticipated.

Attachment: Attch A Winter 2016 (2920 : Proposed Winter 2016/2017 Service Changes)

This proposal creates a 15-minute frequency in the AM and PM peak period, which is
similar to the majority of other individual light rail lines in the peak periods. It reduces the
peak hour, peak direction capacity from 1,500 passengers to 1,000 passengers. Existing
ridership in the peak hour, peak direction is approximately 740 passengers, which still
leaves room for future ridership growth. This brings the peak W Line operation closer to
the level of service of the rest of the system.

Meeting was facilitated by Diane Marquiss. Staff in attendance included Diane Marquiss,
and Cooper Langdon. There were 6 members of the public in attendance.
Diane Suchomel – Wanted specific details regarding the 99/100 service change. She is
retired and doesn’t take the bus often but wanted to be informed. Diane gave her some
information regarding the changes.
Andy Marner – He wanted to discuss the 116L that will be cut when the fall service
changes are implemented. He understood that there is low ridership, but doesn’t have a
good option for getting to the Federal Center. He also does not live in our Call-n-Ride
service area.
Steve Kern – Steve was also there to discuss the proposed cancellation of the 116L and
the possibility of having the first afternoon trip on the 100L leave earlier. Regarding the
116L, Diane told him about our Call-n-Ride service and told him we would send him Brian
Matthews contact information to possibly set up a consistent pick up time.
Linda Metzger – She just stopped in to see what changes were proposed and did not have
any one concern regarding the changes. She did mention that she would like the 116X to
be more direct and skip the local portion of the route. She suggested the route leave Ken
Caryl Park-n-Ride and immediately take C470 and make a stop at the Quincy exit, then
proceed directly to Civic Center. She said the local portion adds too much time to the
route.
Matt Smith – Matt works at the Denver Airport early in the morning and would like a
4:45am-4:50am trip on the C-Line, leaving from Mineral Station. This would allow him to
get a one seat ride to Union Station to catch the A-Line. Currently he has to take the DLine to Broadway Station then catch the E-Line to Union Station, which he said can be a
tight transfer.
Tony Lott – Tony had heard that there were going to be changes to the routes 77 and 85
that also included a fare increase. Once we told him that there were no planned changes
to either of his routes and that the fare structure was not changing, he left happy.

Service Changes
Lynn Philippsen requested that the stop at Table Mesa and Tantra Drive be considered as a
stop on the US36 BRT Flatiron Flyer routes. She stated that the walk to the closest BRT
stop was too far. Staff pointed out that local underlying service on routes DASH and 206
is available and that at this time demand at this stop location does not warrant for it to be
a BRT stop. Staff will continue to monitor demand in this regard.
Bob Lee liked the proposed changes for the BOLT, J and L stops, as well as the Bolt
Express trips. He stated that he would like to see the fare for route BOLT to be local all the
way between Longmont and Boulder and urged RTD staff to reconsider the recent fare
zone change. He also requested that RTD staff look into airport service from Longmont to
Denver, as well as a meeting to discuss various options in this regard with city staff and
members of the TAB. RTD staff will coordinate with City of Longmont staff to set up such
a meeting.
Buzz Feldman also stated that he agreed with the proposed changes and asked when they
would go into effect. He suggested that instead of calling the faster trips on route BOLT
‘express’ to reference them as ‘Limited’ in order to not be too confusing or perhaps
misleading, since the trips will serve all of the agreed upon stops for regular route BOLT
within Longmont and then only travel at a faster pace once outside of the city. Staff
agreed that this would be a good idea and that they would consider doing so.
Peter Lloyd was concerned about the connections from route BOLT to route 206 and
having to walk from 28th Street to Boulder Junction in order to now make his connection.
Upon review of the proposed BOLT Express trips he however noted that they would most
likely provide a good alternative and better connection for him to get from Longmont to
the East Flatiron Business Park. He also encouraged staff to make sure that the
connections to these express trips from route 324 at 8th & Coffman Park-n-Ride be
considered. In addition, he requested to have route FLEX consider making better
connections at Boulder Junction to route 206.
Rolf Kaumann stated that he is a route L (LNX/LSX) passenger and appreciates the service,
as well as that RTD staff is willing to listen to customer concerns and input. He asked why
routes LNX and LSX have to ‘loop’ via 21st and Terry Street before continuing their trips
and requested for staff to look into the elimination of this routing since it could save up to
5 minutes of travel time.
Andrea Papa requested that there be a later LNX or LSX trip in the AM peak that would
better match the 9am work shift start time in Downtown Denver.
Phil Greenwald pointed out that the city is in the process of developing a community
development plan and that within that plan there are suggestions for future bus routes,
including a potential routing for a true BOLT Express, which would avoid multiple railroad
crossings within Longmont.
The meeting closed at 6:30pm.

Meeting was facilitated by Brian Matthews. Staff members in attendance were Pat Heye
and Brian Matthews. RTD Board members in attendance were Director Kent Bagley and
candidate Doug Tisdale. There were 28 members of the public and a representative from
VIA Highlands Ranch Retirement Community
Ted Ruskin – Ted is almost totally blind and has no wife, children, or family at all and
depends on Call-n-Ride and Access-a-Ride to be mobile. Access-a-Ride is ok for things far
out in time but only CnR works for daily trips reserved for the same day.
Ali Zanjani – Ali is the afternoon driver of the Highlands Ranch Call-n-Ride. He thinks the
service needs to stay because the needs of his customers is greater than RTD making
money.
Michelle Yorntz – Michelle’s daughter Sara is a special needs high school graduate who
works at Good Will to be independent and cannot continue with her job without the Call-nRide.
Teri Whitmore – Thinks the Call-n-Ride service is great. Her child is a Mountain Vista
Student who depends on Call-n-Ride since the school busses were taken away. The fixed
route option will not work because it only serves east and west customers to the LRT
Stations. Thinks Call-n-Ride can be saved by recruiting more students for customers.
Option of Lift and Uber is not suitable for children.
Ellianna Gorton – Loves the Call-n-Ride service and her child uses it for transportation back
and forth to school at Stem. She is a single parent and must work so her child must have
CnR. She volunteered to help RTD by joining a committee to help with ridership.
Deanna Evens – Her parents are refugees from Russia in their 70’s and have no other
transportation other than Call-n-Ride. Feels that Call-n-Ride is just not well enough known
in Highlands Ranch. Also thinks that Service should be 7 day per week, not just Monday
thru Friday.
Kelvin Ivery – Has been riding buses all his life and depends on public transportation. He
works in law enforcement and cannot leave work to get his 12 year old daughter home
from school and he is a single father.
Paula McMartin – She has children attending both Stem and Mountain Vista school and
they depend on Call-n-Ride because both her and her husband work. Thinks we could get
more students to bring up the ridership.
Ali Zanjani – Been using Call-n-Ride for 9 years and depends on it to get to and from work.
Thinks the drivers are very special and more marketing might help keep the CnR.

Deanna Evens – Representing group of disabled and senior people. Access-a-Ride does not
work nearly as good as Call-n-Ride because Access-a-Ride has such a large time window
and reservations must be made far in advance. Thinks Douglass county should share the
cost of the Highlands Ranch Call-n-Ride because they pay a special tax to Douglass
County set aside just for transportation needs.
Elaine Gorton – Daughter has Downs Syndrome and works at Good Will. She would lose
all of her independence she has worked so hard for if we lose the Call-n-Ride.
Ted Ruskin – Call-n-Ride needs to do a better job of ride sharing.
Mountain Vista High School - Also submitted for RTD were 2 letters from residents and 16
letters from students who use the Call-n-Ride
St Andrews United Methodist Church – Submitted letter in favor of stops in front of VI

Service Changes
Peter Lozano – he has a son who uses the Route 116L to get to and from school at
McClaine High School. He gets out of class at 12:30pm and works in the library until the
first trip is available on the Route 116L. Jefferson County Schools doesn’t have an
alternative for his son. He and his wife both work and cannot accommodate a pick up time
for his son, so the Route 116L is his sons only alternative.
Miriam Garcia - had questions about the signage on the Route 31L that described the
cancellation of the route service.
Felicia Hardney - She lives in Commerce City and catches the Route 88 and connects to
the Route 89. She believes RTD has not let enough people know about the Route 89 and
that has hampered the level of ridership. She works at Children’s Hospital on Anschutz.
The current Routes 88 and 89 are superior to using the Route 40 and Route 20
combination for access to the hospital. She also sees the people who get on the Route 89
at the mercy Housing stop and wonders what alternatives they would have.
Tommy Thomas - Adding to the comments made by others regarding the cancellation of
the Route 89, he emphasized that the people using this service are low income and transit
dependent with no viable alternatives.
Karlyn Huffman – suggested that RTD request a signal at Yale Street and Yale Court to
allow buses leaving the Yale Station safe access to Yale Avenue. She also mentioned that
the ramp to the platform at Yale Station is too steep for persons in mobility devices,m
stating she observes a woman who has to wait for someone willing to push her up the
ramp on regular basis.
Steve Albers – rides the Route J and has suffered through several changes to service in
the Boulder and Gunbarrel area. He had two suggestions; reinstatement of the stop at
Spine Rd and South Orchard Creek, even if not heavily used he believes it important to
stop at this location due to its proximity to a multi-use trail. His second suggestions is to
add a time point along Spine Rd on the Route J that would allow for better trip planning
for customers in his area. Currently there is 9 minutes between the timepoints.
Salinda Wright - commented on her previous suggestion that was made for the Route 34
to be moved from 38th Avenue as the former Route 38 had been routed. She stated that
she has a difficult time walking to the bus stops on 40th Avenue. She also requested more
frequent service in the peak period on the Route 34 leaving the 31st and Downing area,
stating that in inclimate weather it is difficult to wait for the service, which currently is
offered only every 30 minutes.

Additional Comments
I use the 27 to commute to work daily. The morning drivers
are very punctual and courteous. The afternoon drivers...not
so much. I catch the eastbound 27 at around 3:45pm and
get off about 4:25pm. I would estimate that my afternoon
bus has been on time about 10 times in the past six
months. The schedule says that the bus leaves the
Wadsworth & Hampden PNR at 3:27pm and gets to the
Englewood Station at 4:05pm - it's supposed to leave the
Englewood Station at 4:09pm. I can tell you, pretty much
every day, the bus leaves the PNR at least 5min later and
gets to Englewood anywhere between 4:08 and 4:15.
I fully understand if there is traffic or other factors that
prevent drivers from being on time, but every single day?
What about those drivers who consistently miss the
schedule times because they drive slow or take a long break
at a station? If I was late to work every day I would be
fired; I don't think it's a lot to ask to expect the drivers to
TRY to be on time.
I figure that if the bus is 5min late arriving to my stop and
10min late arriving at my destination, then the schedule
should be advertised to include this 15min adjustment. I
lose that 15min on the ride, and miss my transfer (which
costs me another 30min waiting at another stop), almost
every day. So I'm really losing 45min every day, which is
225min every week, or 900min a month, or 10,800min in a
year. That's a significant enough amount of my time for me
to make this request for an audit, to see if your bus tracking
shows that the timing is hardly ever true to the advertised
schedule.
All I'm asking for is that the people who put together the
schedules to take a serious look at this route, and change
the advertised schedule to show the actual times a rider can
expect it, so riders can plan transfers more accurately.
Today I saw on the sign at 76th & Lowell after October 23 This would
no longer be a stop for the route 31 going North and South. I wanted
to put in a suggestion for you not to change this.
I am a CERT volunteer with rtd and i am hearing from lots of
passengers uses 31 to and from front range community college are
upset because its doesn't serve the westminster station for the b line
I'm calling to voice my opinion about the service changes on route #
31. I travel with a disabled veteran and it has been very convenient
for us to get to recreation center and the library. It is a real disservice
for us in this area and the disabled people.
From what I understood the 31 going by 76th and Lowell
and the ones by the Irving Library will be gone which is no
good. The reason is not only I take, but I know of several
other who do. Some take it on a daily biases because they
can’t afford ubur or a car. Others take it because they can’t
walk to Federal, Sheridan or the B Line. So I please don’t
take the 31 that goes to and from 76th and Lowell and the
Irving Library away
So I am frustrated, you guys are taking away this stop on 76th and
Irving. Not only this stop on this rider alert but all stops affected by
this rider alert. Did you think about the people who catch the bus
from this area. I understand you guys are trying to serve the new
station. now you guys leave a big gap of area you are not servicing? i
want a call back i want to hear you guys are putting a bus to cover
these stops you are taking away.

I am highly upset that you have changed the 43. The changes to this
route have made it so hard to get to the rail from the 43 stop. In the
past I have even had to help elderly people get from the 43 stop to
30th and Downing. If this was a Highlands Ranch this wouldnt
happen. Lastly this 28 is ridiculous. Now is there no weekend service
to the grocery store. There is no way I could walk from the 43 to the
grocery store. How could RTD stop a major bus like this from running
on the weekend. RTD only cares about the train and no longer cares
about the custom
I read that you may be changing the route 72 and that it will not stop
on 55th & Marshall I need that bus to stop at that stop going both
directions.
I like that you're proposing 15 minute frequencies, but why
only to Olde Town Arvada, more commuters on the G line
are going to be coming from the North of Olde Town
Arvada than they are from the south. Seriously, between
Lakewood Commons & Olde Town only? or Southwest
Plaza & Olde Town. Like I said before there are large
number of riders coming from north of Olde Town.
I strongly urge you to increase the 15 minute frequencies
up to at least 80th Ave.

Please do not discontinue the 89 line between Stapleton and the
Fitzsimons Medical campus. I use this route five days a week to get
to and from my job. The alternative would be to walk 1.7 miles to the
Central Park A line, ride it to Peoria, transfer to the R line, take it to
Fitzsimons and then walk another 8 blocks to my office. This would
take me almost 2 hours. The other option is to walk the 2.5 miles
between my house and my job through an unsafe neighborhood with
no sidewalks. If ridership is low, why can't RTD just send the small
shuttle bus instead of the full size bus? You could also eliminate the
buses in the late morning and early afternoon and just run buses
between 7-9 a.m. and 3-7 p.m. I am begging you - do not discontinue
this bus route.

I strongly disagree with your decision to discontinue this
route. It provides a much-needed quick connection between
Stapleton / Central Park Station and UC Health / CU
Anschutz Medical Campus.
People heading east on the A line will now have to make
three transit changes instead of two: Transfer at Aline
Peoria Station to the R Line, and get off at Fitzsimmons
station, and wait for a CU shuttle, which due to lack of
roadways, will go onto congested arterial roadways and
take as longer to get to the hospital than a direct bus from
Central Park.
I would strongly suggest that RTD delay the discontinuation
of the 89 route until the Fitzsimmons Redevelopment
Authority and City of Aurora have constructed roadways
that will link the Fitz Station to the southern medical
campus.
Lastly, the CU Shuttle will not be picking up passengers at
the Colfax Station, as a pull-out /pic-up was not
implemented and CU shuttles cannot stop in traffic lanes.
Please reconsider/delay this decision until effective access
from the stations is realized. If not, folks like me will just
start driving to Anschutz in December.
Hello, I live in Stapleton and am writing to oppose the
proposed discontinuation of bus route 89 this winter. More
an more people from the medical profession move to
Stapleton all the time for its location to the Anschultz
campus and if you want people to use public transportation,
there needs to be a route like this. Bus 89 is an important
community resource that benefits residents and local
businesses. I strongly urge RTD to reconsider their plan to
discontinue the route.

December due to low ridership.I ride this bus every
weekday to reach my job. It's the last leg of my journey
from Littleton, which takes two buses and two trains, a two
hour trip. If this bus is discontinued I will be forced to take
the 105 bus and walk half a mile from Central Park. I'm 60,
and the prospect of having to make my way this distance
through the snow fills me with despair.Also, there are no
89 schedules available at Anschutz Medical Center, which
also prevents riders from accessing the route. Those in
wheelchairs need this route even more than I do!
Don't punish the riders for your own oversights and
shortcomings. I realize your focus us all about the trains
these days, but please, have mercy on those of us who
take the 89 bus.Please reconsider the discontinuation of the
89 bus!
I live in Stapleton 9164 E28th ave. Please do not discontinue the bus
route. Members of my household need access. Thanks
I have recently been informed by bus driver of 89 bus that
this line will soon be discontinued. I live in Stapleton and
work at the Anschutz Medical Campus and the only two
bus lines that can take me to work are 20 and 89. The only
line that is always on time and always follows the schedule
is 89! Second, both A and R lines will not cover people
from Stapleton who work at the Anschutz (and the number
of these people is substantially increasing as I can see) from
several reasons:
1) R line is covering Aurora
2) R line can take a person from Fitzsimmons to Peoria
station, however in order to reach Stapleton that person still
needs to wait for A line, and then to take another bus
usually 28B to reach Stapleton as train station is absolutely
far away from residential part of Stapleton
3) With your proposed solution to catch lines R and A, I will
need approximately an hour to reach my home, or work,
while with 89, I am at my destination in 10-15 minutes
If you discontinue 89, I will most likely cancel my Ecco
Pass, as it would not make sense to me taking a bus line 20
that is usually always late, or train everyday to work. I think
that instead of discontinuing 89 line, much better solution
would be to limit it to cover several hours early in the
morning (5-10 am) and afternoon (3-7 pm) when most of
the people are commuting to home or work.
I heard recently that bus line 89 will soon be discontinued. I live in
Stapleton and work at the Anschutz Medical Campus and this is
basically the only reliable bus line that can take me to work within
20-30 min! I’m not sure if you’re aware but A and R lines will NOT
cover people living in Stapleton who work at the Anschutz (and the
number of these people is substantially increasing).
If you discontinue 89, I will most likely cancel my Ecco Pass, because
line 20 is usually late. Instead of discontinuing 89 line, please
consider limiting it to early in the morning (5-10 am) and afternoon
(3-7 pm) when most of the people are commuting to home or work.

I am requesting that you continue to provide service on the 89 line.
There is no close access to any bus line from the eastbridge area of
Stapleton. Your proposal to take the A line would required a 1/2
hour walk. The New R line will require a 1/2 hour walk also since
there is no direct sidewalk routes available. Loss of this bus line
would create a severe hardship for riders accessing the eastbridge
area of Stapleton, including many low income residents.
The route will also benefit people needing access to the new king
Soopers grocery store especially low income families using public
transportation.

Hello my name is Zavelia, I am a doctoral student at the Anschutz
Medical Campus , live in the area of Stapleton and Route 89 is the
only route that i can take to go to school, some friends and I took
this route during the week (Monday to Friday) to go to school. I
disagree with the discontinue service of this route, as most people
without a car in the Stapleton area take this bus to get to work and
school, and I believe that in November this route will be benefited
the grocery store on Martin Luther king, as this route will be an ideal
medium of transport for people who go to this store, which will
increase the use of this route. Please do not take this route, it is
important for all those who attended the Anschutz Medical Campus
route.

I'm so surprised to see that you are planing to discontinue
bus 89! It is not true that the ridership is low. People are
moving to Stapelton every day and it is much bigger than
few years ago.
I have been using line 89 since I moved to Stapelton. This is
the only bus that connects Stapelton with Anschutz
Medical Campus where I work. There is no alternative for
this bus. The trains A or R line are not at all convenient
because they are so far and I will need to take another bus
(or two) to be able to use this trains.
I am using ECO pass now, only because of line 89. If you
discontinue this service I will not longer need to pay for
ECO pass.

I’d like to express my concerns regarding Route 89...
I live in the area at Havana St and MLK blvd in Stapleton. I don’t ride
it daily, but I do about 3 times a week. The reason I don’t ride more
frequently are:
1. no service on weekends;
2. the bus schedule is not convenient enough for me (goes only once
an hour).
My concern is: why the route 89 is planned to be closed completely?
I understand that reason is “low ridership”. Did you know that, there
will be a new King Soopers store opening in that area this Fall and it
will impact ridership situation.My proposal is to wait another 3
months, to see what kind of impact the newly opened King Soopers
store will have, before completely closing route 89.
Hello, I am reaching out to you with respect to the proposed changes
for Route 89. My mother-in-law has to take 2 buses and the light rail
from Stapleton to her job in Lakewood (and back). She was just
informed by her bus driver last night that you are proposing to
cancel the 89. If this gets cancelled, she will have to walk an hour to
the light rail station from her house each morning and back at night.
Is there any chance that you could continue this service for the 89? If
not, is there another option for her to get to the Central Park
station? She does not have a car.
Hello,
I understand you intend to discontinue this route in December due
to low ridership. I ride this bus every weekday to reach my job. It's
the last leg of my journey from Littleton, which takes two buses and
two trains, a two hour trip. If this bus is discontinued I will be forced
to take the 105 bus and walk half a mile from Central Park. I'm 60,
and the prospect of having to make my way this distance through the
snow fills me with despair. I believe your low ridership numbers are
likely due to the fact that this route is not included in your trip
planner. If a bus driver hadn't known better, I'd be walking three
miles as the trip planner directs me to do.
Also, there are no 89 schedules available at Anschutz Medical Center,
which also prevents riders from accessing the route. Those in
wheelchairs need this route even more than I do!
Don't punish the riders for your own oversights and shortcomings. I
realize your focus us all about the trains these days, but please, have
mercy on those of us who take the 89 bus:

I saw this sign at Union and 2nd Place. I went to http://www.rtddenver.com/servicechanges-fall2016.shtml and didn't see any
reference to Route 125. Can you please update me on Route 125?
Can you tell me about the opening of the G-Line as well?
I was told you will be getting rid of the 116L this week. The 116L is
the only route that can get me to my job without having to walk 2030 minutes no other bus runs by my work. You cannot get rid of the
116L alot of people rely and depend on that route. If anything it
would be more beneficial for it to run more frequently than it does.
I'm writing to give my comment on the proposed discontinuation of
the 169L at 7:10pm. Without this bus at this specific time, I will not
be able to get to and from my place of work at the airport and could
possibly lose my job. This is why I'm against the discontinuation.
Thank you for reading.
Greetings: I am writing today concerning one of the proposed Winter
service changes....discontinuance of the Rt. 169L southbound trip at
7:10 PM on weekdays. As someone who rides this particular trip I
strongly oppose this change and am writing to urge you to keep this
trip and not discontinue.
To me, this trip seems to have a respectable number of riders. Not
as packed as a 15 or a 15L but what I would consider to be decent
ridership. And, I would like to point out this trip does indeed have
some regular riders.
I do not ride the 169L on weekends and so I cannot comment on the
proposed discontinuance of the southbound trip at 7:10 PM on
weekends. However, I firmly but respectfully ask to keep the 7:10
PM southbound trip on weekdays. Thank you for your consideration
of my comments. Please feel free to contact me if you have any
questions or wish to discuss further.
Hi i am a frequent rider of the 169L it is the most affordable and
fastest way to get the airport where my job is at. My job doesn't
offer rtd discounts so its cheaper to catch the 169L. I wish it had
more 169 L buses because it is very convenient. So please let it
continue to be in operation thank you
I live around 8467 Chase Drive and regularly take advantage of
services between Wadsworth and Sheridan, and 88th and 92nd. I
don't understand and can't agree with your plans to shut down the
services provided by the 31, 51, and 92 in these areas. As a baby
boomer, I expect that you will be encouraging folks my age and
younger to drive LESS in the coming years and to take local buses to
get to regional buses and trains! Installation of the G line did not
reduce the ongoing need for good and regular local bus service in
NW and North Arvada. In my case, with your taking almost all
services away from Harlan & 88th, I will have to walk over a mile
instead of half a mile...or drive, which you will want to discourage as
the years roll on.
Why is the 31l being cancelled. I have to be at work by 6 a.m.
downtown and this is the earliest bus that gets me there. I live in
Westminster and don't own a car. How am I going to get to work if
there is no bus to get me to the park and ride. The 51 doesn't go to
the Light Rail station in Westminster at this time or at a time that I
can take it to get to work. I'm very upset that the 31 is being
cancelled.

A line is the worst experience people have coming to this State to
have fun. TSA employees have stopped using A line because they
can't be late. Many DIA employee's have stopped using A line and
they tell travelers not to use A line.
I've seen several news stories about customer complaints
regarding the A-line and the required horn sounding at
crossings, especially in the Stapleton area near the hotels.
Trains sound their horns to warn people as they approach
an intersection, but as I see it, you have a better warning
system in place with the crossing guards that are present
due to the faulty gate arms. I think a very sound argument
can be made that you have a higher standard for warning at
intersections, with the crossing guards and that the horn
sounding is not necessary. Deaf people can't hear a horn,
but the definitely can see a guard in a reflective vest!
5th time taking to events Downtown. Need more frequency!!! Work
at airport. Sometimes arrive midnight or later.
Will the stop for the Bolt bus at 55th and 119 be back in service this
Saturday October 15 so I can use it to get to work at Celestrial
Seasonings on Saturday.
I do not want to walk over 2 miles to the next stop at 63rd and would
be very happy to have this in use again.
Please reply so I will know if I have to pay somebody for a ride.

I’d like to start off by saying that I have had nothing but
great experiences riding the RTD bus to work. The bus
driver that works the BOLT route in the morning is
FANTASTIC. I’m writing today in hopes that you will
strongly consider reinstating the BOLT stop within the
Monarch Business Park near Niwot. I relied heavily on bus
transport during winter months last year as biking to work
(as I typically do in the warmer months) isn’t really an
option. There are several reasons that I believe the stop
should be reinstated, at a minimum during the winter
months.
• as winter storms roll in, walking down the 52 from the
diagonal to work isn’t safe in the least. Cars will
undoubtedly be swerving on ice as I’m walking in the bike
lane down a road that the speed limit is 55mph on.
• there were about 5 people that used the bus on a regular
basis last winter (both to and from work) and I suspect
those same folks need transit to and from the business
park. In addition, there are 3 other people that ride the bus
that work in the business park. Some of them are currently
walking along the train tracks and cutting through a large
field to get to their work. Also, not safe.
• even if you only offered one stop in the morning and one
in the evening, that would be better than nothing. The
BOLT stops at IBM every morning, before it drops me at the
52 and Diagonal and more often than not, there is nobody
on the bus that gets off at IBM. There are several large
businesses in my complex: Lucky’s Market Corporate
Offices, Spark Fun, Case Logic, Crocs to name a few.
• when I leave work, I’m forced to stand on the side of the
diagonal for 10 minutes as cars are whizzing by at 60mph.
Also, not safe.
While I don’t expect that anyone at RTD really cares about
one persons opinion, it’s still really disheartening to think
that the need to save a buck or two by cutting a stop that
was being used is more important than the safety and
livelihood of some good folks who commute every day. I’d
really like to continue to rely on bus transit but if the stop
isn’t reinstated, I’ll be forced to make some financial
decisions that I’m not in a place to make just so that I can
ensure I can get to work safely.

I’d really love to hear back from someone regarding this
stop. I only wish I reached out immediately when the stop
was discontinued… but I just figured I was only one voice.
And that I’d be ignored.
Your E and F lines all need 4th cars. I have been contacting
RTD continuously and getting nowhere. There needs to be a
resolution
I really don't understand why the stop and Broadway & Canyon was
taken out. That is a busy stop with a lot of riders and with that stop
gone there is a great distance between the stops. With bad weather
coming and the distance between those stops it make it hard for
people to want to catch that bus. It would be nice to get that stop
back or another stop put in at Broadway & Arapahoe to make it
more convenient for the riders out this way.

I've been advised to provide my feedback to this email address. I've
been riding the bus (the BF, and now, unfortunately the FF1 and FF3)
for several years, and have never had a problem with it until the "FF"
routes were introduced. Now, unless school is out for Summer or
Winter break, there is only standing room only (if you're lucky
enough to even get on the bus - often times there's not even
standing room left) for FF1 and FF3 buses leaving Union Station at
5:09pm and 5:17pm. I don't usually catch the buses surrounding
these times, but I would be willing to bet they have the same
problem. This has been going on ever since the FF routes were
introduced, yet after personally writing multiple times, and even
seeing others actually writing their complaints while on the bus (you
can see a lot while standing for your ride home), here we are several
months later and nothing has changed. I understand the 90L was
brought back, but that did nothing to address the large number of
passengers leaving Union Station. Being used to riding the BF where
there was very rarely ever a time when passengers would have to
stand, I don't understand why the change to the FF route was made
if this is how people have to ride this bus now. And what is even
more baffling is that nothing has changed to fix it after multiple
people have written to point out the issue and complain to try to get
it fixed. How and when will this issue be fixed?
I noted that the October service changes are planned to
include schedule adjustments to routes FF1 and FF3, which
I ride daily. What I would like to propose is that the
morning trips for these two routes be better spaced to
provide better transfers at Union Station for the many riders
who continue on to the Denver tech center via light rail.
Currently, the FF1 and FF3 busses arrive at almost the
same time, at least those that I see (approximately 6:03
am, at Sheridan station). I run for a train at Union Station
almost every morning, and it would be great if one of these
two routes came just 5 to 10 minutes earlier.
I've been a bus-commuter for nearly 8 years.
Recently I got a new job that involves a different bus. I live in Golden
and most of the time I have been an RTD commuter I have worked in
Golden. And that was fine. Maybe the 16/16L isn't always as
frequent as I would like, but I made it work.
Now I work in Boulder. I'm fortunate enough to work a 9-5 (ish) job.
The GS is simple enough most of the time. But I work weekends, my
job is in an industry where we don't just do Monday-Friday. My
commute more than doubles on the weekend - I have to go into
Denver just to get to Boulder.
I can't socialise with my new coworkers because if I miss the 6pm GS
on weekdays, I have to go into Denver to get home to Golden. On
occasions when I have to work late to finish a time-sensitive project,
I have to go into Denver to get home. Or spend $30-45 on a car
home. On occasions when I have to go in for a mid-day meeting on
my day off, I basically spend my whole day off at work, because since
it takes so long to go into Denver then back out to Golden, I typically
just take the GS and use the extra hours to reorganise my desk or
something.
What I am saying is please expand the hours of the GS. Make it
convenient.
After the 2 hour ride last night from Boulder to Golden, I
was too exhausted to suggest changing the GS to broader
service.
An hour and 45 minutes to get from Golden to Boulder this
morning. Oh wow, if only there were some other way to
get between those two places.

My son told me today of a proposal to stop Call-N-Ride in Highlands
Ranch. Please consider this a formal plea to continue this service for
the following reasons:
1. My son goes to stem school and he is highly dependent on this
ride so he can get picked up safely after school since both my
husband and I work.
2. My son is able to go to Valor school for his after school physical
education activities that is not offered in STEM and because both
and my husband work this is his only way for him get to his class at
Valor at a timely and predicted manner.
3. Losing the Call N Ride will cause a hardship for my son and family
and other families as many students at STEM utilize this service.
I am also very willing to speak in person or via phone at 303-9497685 regarding our concerns should this service is discontinued.

Hello I am writing in regards to the possible cancellation of the bus
for the highlands ranch call n ride. my two kids and I both live in
south Denver. We use the call and ride from Skyview Academy to
lone tree entertainment district. This helps so that way my kids can
come to my work during my work hours after school. I am concerned
if there is no Call in ride that my kids will have to make the walk from
Skyview Academy to Quebec Street. This would be very hard in the
winter and double as far as timing goes. I'm writing to ask the board
to consider this email. As I am a single parent with two children who
commute 40 miles total per day for school and work. If there are
further questions for feed back please let me know.
Hi this is Danica autume Estrada's youngest daughter I am saying
that that should not do this to the call and ride because it helps me
whith my mom and her job my father is in jail fore bad things and
she has a hard time getting us to hear job and this bus is going to
help us and we go to Skyview academy it's a long way from school
and whith me and my older brother and the grads we are in and all
or books it helps us but we need this to go in to this meeting please

I am single mother who lives in Highlands Ranch and am a
frequent user of the Call-n-Ride service. This service is
valuable to me and my family and its being discontinued
would be a devastating blow. My kids use it every day to
get back and forth from school and this past summer I also
used for additional needs.
It is a wonderful service and I appreciate the
professionalism of each person that I have interacted with
that make this ride possible.
PLEASE do not discontinue service.

Our family has been greatly saddened by the news that our beloved
RTD Call a Ride bus service in Highlands Ranch will be discontinued
next year.
We respectfully ask you to reconsider this decision, as it will
negatively affect the lives of many residents of Highlands Ranch, and,
especially members of the most vulnerable population, the senior
citizens of Highlands Ranch, CO.
We know that people living in the suburbs often feel isolated. But
this isolation is even more unbearable for people residing in
Highlands Ranch who cannot get anywhere without the excellent
services provided by the drivers of RTD’s Call-n-Ride bus service in
Highlands Ranch.
My parents, refugees from the former Soviet Union, are in their late
70s, and are loyal patrons of the RTD’s Call-n-Ride bus service. They
have been able to get around and to pursue a healthy lifestyle thanks
to the RTD’s Call-n-Ride in Highlands Ranch, CO.

I know people that use this .... it would be a heartship for them if you
discontinued this service in Highlands Ranch..

Thank you for the proposal for Discontinuance of Highlands
Ranch Call-and-Ride.
This is not a legitimate function of government, nor
something that should be funded by compulsory tax
payments.
I understand that you are considering discontinuing the Call-N-Ride
service in Highlands Ranch. I urge you to reconsider this.
While I don’t personally live in Highlands Ranch, I have an employee
and her family who use the service regularly and depend upon it.
This is an essential service in a car-dominated part of metro Denver,
and should remain a Call-N-Ride service area for the RTD.
Discontinuance of the service would just exacerbate the “last mile”
problem of urban mass transit in the Denver metro area—a move in
the wrong direction.

The current RTD proposal to discontinue the Call-N-Ride service in
the Highlands Ranch area has our family very concerned and
troubled. This is a valuable service which we appreciate and value
on a daily basis. A discontinuation of this service will cause undue
stress and conflict for many of us.
Please take my concerns and those of others under sincere
consideration when weighing the pros and cons of this proposal. We
await the decision and sincerely hope it is a favorable one.
Sharon wants to express her opinion on the proposed
schedule change. She does NOT want the Highlands Ranch
call and ride to be elimated. She is a senior and that is vital
for her and the seniors in her area to get around. She can
not attend the meeting tonight. She doesnt have access to
a computer to email her opinion or fax it in. Please re
consider elimating it. Thank you

I'm concerned about the discontinuance of of Monday –
Friday eastbound rush-hour trips from Federal Center
Station. Your qualification for doing this is "This proposal
would create 15 minute frequency, which is similar to other
light rail lines during rush-hour periods." HOWEVER, all of
the other lines have 3 or 4 cars for each trip and the W line
only has 2 cars. During rush hour the trains are already
packed and one cannot find a seat to sit in. A lot of time it
is a struggle to even get in the car because people are
standing in the entrance/exits because there are no
available seats.

Our mission: to inspire spiritual maturity in outwardly focused Christians
who love their neighbors and serve the common good.

October 5, 2016

To RTD Representative and others it may concern:
Although I can't attend this evening's public meeting with RTD representatives, Suzanne
McFarland of Vi at Highlands Ranch tells me that RTD is considering installing bus stops along
South University Boulevard in front of both Vi and St. Andrew. I'm writing this note on St.
Andrew's behalf to voice our support for those new stops. A number of our church members live
at Vi, and a bus line would make it easier for them to be here throughout the week for church
events, bible studies, concerts, and the like.
A stop in front of our church would also enable people from other areas of the Denver
metropolitan area to get here more easily on Sunday mornings and throughout the week. St.
Andrew's church building is extensively used by community groups for art shows, concerts,
public lectures, seminars, and the like, so a bus stop would help us make those events available
to more people.
From our inception, St. Andrew has been dedicated to being a church for all. We place a strong
value on inclusivity, community, and service. Additional bus stops on University Boulevard in
front of the Vi and our church building will help us live out those values. We're grateful for RTD's
consideration of our needs. Please feel free to contact me with any questions or for further
conversation at 303.794.2683 x 153 or adunning@gostandrew.com.
Sincerely,

Andy Dunning
Executive Pastor

Attch E Douglas County Call-n-Ride Letter

12.B.e

~~DOUGLAS COJI~JX

Office of the County Commissioners
www.douglas.co.us

Mr. Tom Tobiassen, Chair
Regional Transportation District
1600 Blake Street
Denver, CO 80202
Dear Mr. Tobiassen:
The Board of County Commissioners is very concerned about the proposed elimination of the
Highlands Ranch Call-n-Ride. With limited service available in the area, it is alarming that the
citizens of Highlands Ranch are potentially losing an affordable transportation service option in
their community.
In a good faith effort, Douglas County entered into a cost sharing agreement with the Highlands
Ranch Metro District (HRMD) and RTD in October 2014 to save this service from elimination.
Douglas County worked closely with a Transit Advisory Committee (TAC) made up of concerned
residents, RTD and HRMD staff to improve ridership. As a result of these efforts, the service
area was adjusted and the TAC participants worked to promote ridership through enhanced
outreach and marketing efforts. In 2015, these efforts increased ridership from 2.0 to 2.4
boardings per hour. In 2016, the ridership continued to increase until the summer months
when students were not utilizing the service for school trips.
It is disheartening that RTD would choose to cut a service that has demonstrated improvement
while ignoring the contribution that Douglas County citizens make to RTD. In 2014, Douglas
County contributed $22,958,456 in sales tax revenue to RTD and in return received $11,341,838
in transit service investment within the County.
If RTD feels that the Call-n-Ride model is not an appropriate service option for the Highlands
Ranch area, we would like to work with RTD staff to identify a ride share alternative using Go
Centennial, for example, as a model. We propose RTD provide a portion of our tax contribution
as seed funding to contract for ride share services in the RTD Highlands Ranch service area. We
believe this option would be more cost effective than the Call-n-Ride model, while addressing
customer needs. In order to maintain service for residents during this transition, we ask that
RTD continue to support the Highlands Ranch Call-n-Ride service during the development and
implementation of an alternative option.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

Date: October 13, 2016

From:

Terry Emmons, Assistant General Manager,
Rail Operations

GM

Date:

October 12, 2016

Board Meeting Date: October 25, 2016

Subject:

Authorization to enter into contract with
Protran Technology for purchase of Railway
Worker Protection Early Warning System
(16DR0003)

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to enter into a contract not to exceed $1,500,000 with
Protran Technology for the purchase of a Railway Worker Protection Early Warning System and
associated equipment (Contract Number 16DR003).
BACKGROUND:
Railway worker protection has been in the spotlight in recent years brought on by numerous
Maintenance of Wayside worker accidents and fatalities. On December 18, 2013, the NTSB made an
urgent safety recommendation to the FTA to prevent further accidents on rail transit systems. This
recommendation was for the FTA to issue a directive to all transit properties requiring redundant
protection for roadway workers. The District has a solid policy in place incorporating flags and red
signals where feasible to protect workers on the right of way. Our collective opinion is that safety can
be greatly improved. The current policy relies on human beings to remember locations of work parties
and work parties ability to spot the oncoming trains and leave the track before the train passes. There
are numerous factors that erode the effectiveness of this procedure such as time of day, visibility,
weather, operator/worker fatigue and architectural configurations. An early warning system will notify
the train operator and worker well in advance, often before the train is visible to the work party and is
not affected by these environmental factors. Early warning systems are currently the most effective
means of protecting workers in the right of way from trains and would be an essential enhancement to
railway safety all around. This early warning system would not take away any of the current safety
procedures, but would add an additional layer of protection.
The recommended system is an electronic device mounted on all light rail trains that, in conjunction with
the hand-held device carried by any railway workers, will warn both the operator and the worker well in
advance of each other. The system uses radios on both ends and will give a minimum 15 second
warning before the train arrives at the workers location. The workers can then move to a place of safety
before the train’s arrival.
DISSCUSSION:
RTD initially issued an Invitation for Bid (IFB 26DR001) on May 27, 2016 for the acquisition of a railway
worker protection early warning system. RTD received two bids, one of which did not meet our
specifications and one which exceeded our project budget. RTD subsequently issued a Request for
Proposals (RFP 16DR003) on August 19, 2016 with revised specifications for a similar system.

Packet Pg. 104

12.C

Evaluative criteria were cost- 50%, conformance with specifications- 30%, history and proven track
record with this equipment- 10%, and quality of references- 10%. RTD’s evaluation committee
consisted of Karl Shoemaker, MOW Senior Supervisor, Track Engineer; Matt Younce, Manager of
Maintenance Training; Greg Pennington, General Superintendent of Rail Infrastructure; and Leo Fautsch,
Senior Buyer.
RTD received two proposals; one from Metrom and one from Protran Technology. The evaluation
committee recommends Protran Technology, the proposer that met our specification and was the only
one within the project budget.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
The cost of the Railway Worker Protection Early Warning System is funded in the Board approved 2016
budget.
ALTERNATIVES:
1. It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to enter into a contract not to exceed
$1,500,000 with Protran Technology for purchase of a Railway Worker Protection Early Warning
System and associated equipment (Contract Number 16DR003). This is the recommended
alternative.
2. Do not authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute a contract with Protran
Technology to purchase needed Railway Worker Protection Early Warning System. This action
would result in RTD’s inability to improve the safety of its railway workers and risk future
accidents. This is not the recommended action as it would not allow us to improve worker
safety.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

From:

Heather
Copp,
Administration

Date:

October 13, 2016

Subject:

Transfer FasTracks Sales and Use Tax
Revenues in Excess of Forecasted Sales and
Use Tax Revenues to FasTracks Internal
Savings Account

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: October 13, 2016
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: October 25, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors approve transferring FasTracks sales and use tax revenues (.4%) from unrestricted fund
balance to the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) on an annual basis when actual sales and
use tax revenues (.4%) collected for the calendar year exceed the forecasted sales and use tax
revenues (.4%) projected in the adopted budget each year. The actual sales and use tax revenues
will be determined based on the audited financial statements.
BACKGROUND
During the course of preparing and adopting the Annual Program Evaluation (APE) and Financial Plan,
many meetings with the Board of Directors and stakeholders were held regarding the lack of funds
and use of the FISA to assist in funding shortfalls in FasTracks. Use of the FISA to cover shortfalls
in operations and maintenance was not popular with many of the Board members and stakeholders,
but staff felt it was a necessity due to current revenue forecasts.
DISCUSSION
During meetings with some of the stakeholders, it was suggested that if FasTracks revenue
forecasts improved in the future those excess funds could be directed towards the FISA. Some
stakeholders felt this could evidence continued RTD support for construction of the unfunded
corridors. This action would transfer, on an annual basis, FasTracks sales and use tax revenue in
excess of the forecasted FasTracks sales and use tax revenue to the FISA account. This would only
occur if there was actual revenue collected above the forecast.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
This should not have a fiscal impact as any FasTracks sales and use tax actual collections over the
yearly forecasted projections would already be deposited and be used towards the FasTracks program
generally. This action would direct those revenues to the FISA account instead of the unrestricted fund
balance.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. FasTracks sales and use tax revenues in excess of
forecasted revenue will be annually transferred to the FISA account.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Revenues in excess of forecasted revenue will be
retained in the unrestricted fund balance but can still be specifically transferred to the FISA
