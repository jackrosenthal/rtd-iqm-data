Director Walker stated he has been riding the light rail for 17 years.  He commented that every morning the trains are spotless, but every evening they are exceedingly untidy.  He said the cleaning crews do a tremendous job in getting the trains nice and clean every morning.

## V. Public Participation

Chair Tobiassen stated public participation was open to anyone that wanted to address the Board.  He reminded the audience that each speaker is allowed three minutes.

- Roger Partridge, Douglas County Commissioner – District II, said he was here to speak on behalf of the Highlands Ranch Call-n-Ride.  He stated that the county understands the issue and appreciates the opportunity to work with RTD to find a solution to continue this service.  He remarked that Douglas County has yet to receive a formal proposal from RTD, but he looks forward to the opportunities and possibilities that will be presented.  He asked the Board to move this item to staff so they might consider all of the options and present them to both the RTD and Douglas County Boards.

- Joan Peck, City of Longmont City Council, remarked that she was here to discuss the State Highway 119 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) funding and the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA).  She stated it was important that the 119 BRT work with the Northwest Area Mobility (NAMS) Study and more importantly, that it does not compete with FasTracks.  She commented that passing the 119 BRT item will allow for the examination of various funding options, and it is also needed for the leverage of Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) funds.  She further requested that the Board consider transferring FasTracks revenues in excess to the FISA, for future FasTracks construction.

- Dennis Coombs, City of Longmont – Mayor, commented that the City of Longmont felt so strongly about the 119 BRT Study that the City sent two representatives to speak to the Board about this item.  He requested that the funding item be passed, as it was the City’s understanding that the funding was already in the approved budget.  He asked that the Board pass this item so that it can move to the next phase of the process.

- Tina McDonald, Northglenn, commented that she attended the ADA Paratransit Advisory (APAC) Committee last week, and while there, she had asked who was paying for the decorative concrete and art at the commuter rail stations, while the ADA Community is asking for improvements to stations.  She added that trying to get reservations to the APAC Committee was impossible.  She noted that while the two presidential candidates were in town, the Text Telephone (TTY) lines did not work.  She added that RTD does not have a dedicated phone line, email or text number for people to make Call-n-Ride reservations.  She noted that she had asked an employee to make the reservations for her, but that was denied because the calls must be recorded.  She asked the Board when they were going to sit down with the ADA community to discuss these issues.

- Karlan Huffman, Denver, noted that she lives at the Yale Station Apartments, but the 27 and 46 Buses only run on the weekdays.  She said that because of this, the residents do not have any way to get around on the weekends.  She added that the ramp at Yale Station is too steep and the residents cannot get up the ramp to the light rail platform without assistance from others.

- Suzanne McFarland, Highlands Ranch, indicated that she was the HR Manager at Vi Highlands Ranch, an assisted living facility.  She said that she is consistently trying to inform her residents about the Call-n-Ride Service and she hopes that the Board will extend, or expand the program.  She remarked that the residents at Vi are losing their independence, and being able to use transportation is important.  She added that the residents would like to be able to call and set up their rides on their own, and she hopes to increase the awareness among her residents that the Call-n-Ride service will be utilized in the area.

- Regan Bryd, Denver, stated that she is one of the RTD Board Candidates for District A.  She noted that she attended the Board meeting because she saw the proposal to cut the Highlands Ranch Call-n-Ride on the meeting agenda.  She remarked that Highlands Ranch already suffers from lack of public transportation in general and her alma matter, Mountain Vista HS, wrote letters to the Board that were included in the packet.  She encouraged the Board to reexamine how and when a service is going to be cut.  She said that there needs to be a way to integrate conversations before service changes are submitted.  She also asked the Board to use this opportunity to examine how it conducts business and communicates with the community.  She added that change is needed, regardless of who wins the RTD elections.

- Doug Tisdale, Cherry Hills Village, indicated that he too is a candidate for the RTD Board, representing District H.  He wanted to express his concurrence of Commissioner Partridge’s comments and noted his confidence that there would be a positive dialogue between the RTD Board and Douglas County.  He added that he hopes there is creativity and collaboration in keeping the Highlands Ranch Call-n-Ride.

- Robert Denis, Aurora, remarked that behind the Chili’s at the Southmore Park-n-Ride, there needs to be a ramp from the station to the shopping center.  He said at the moment, there is a divider and a 5-foot elevation and he was hoping that the Board would consider ramp access to rectify the inaccessibility.

## XI. Unanimous Consent

There were no Unanimous Consent Agenda items.

### A. Budget Transfer for SH 119 Bus Rapid Transit Environmental Clearance and Basic Engineering

It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors approve a transfer of $3.5 million from the Planning expense grant project budget to a new capital project for the SH 119 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Corridor, which will permit staff to seek consultant services for assistance in the preparation of National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review and Advanced Basic Engineering services.  A total of $1.5 million in funding for this project was approved in the 2016 Amended Budget in the Planning expense grant budget, and the remaining funds are planned for 2017 and 2018 in the 2017-2022 Strategic Budget Plan (SBP).

Motion:               Director Sisk made the motion to approve the Budget Transfer for SH 119 Bus Rapid Transit Environmental Clearance and Basic Engineering.

Director Anderson seconded the motion.

Discussion:               Director Bagley indicated that he wanted everyone on the Board to know that he read the letter from the 36 Mayors Coalition and he had read the Northwest Mobility Study, and he is in full support of this item.  He added that it is imperative that the Board move this forward.

Director Francone stated it was her understanding that this is not a FasTracks project, nor does the funding come from the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA).  She asked Heather Copp to explain the funding amounts.

Heather Copp, Chief Financial Officer and Assistant General Manager of Finance and Administration remarked that the original funding was for $3.5 million over three years.  She stated that staff is asked for that total amount to be advanced this year so that staff can issue the Request for Proposal (RFP).

Director Lubow commented that she is in support of this item.  She added that while she is an advocate for Rail, her stakeholders want the BRT because they do not know when the Northwest Rail will arrive.  She highlighted that this action item is only funding the study, and will vet the various options and costs of the project.

Director Hoy said his previous committee vote was no, but he has reconsidered the issue and after recent conversations with his stakeholders, he will be voting yes tonight.

Director Anderson asked if this was a planning grant from Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG).

Heather Copp remarked that a portion of it is from DRCOG, and the rest is made up of RTD funds.

Director Anderson stated that she would be supporting this item since it will not be paid by FasTracks.

Director Solano asked for the name of the firm that will be completing the study.

Heather Copp stated that a firm had not been selected, and one of the main reasons staff wants to issue the RFP is to award the project to a firm.

Chair Tobiassen commented that the completion of this study is important, and by doing so, it would allow RTD to apply for future grants.

Vote on

The Motion:              The motion passed with 13 in favor (Anderson, Archuleta, Bagley, Francone, Hoy, James, Lasater, Lubow, Menten, Sisk, Solano, Tobiassen, Walker) and 1 opposed (Folska).  Director Deadwyler was absent.

Chair Tobiassen declared the motion PASSED.

### B. Proposed Winter 2016/2017 Service Changes

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors approve the Winter 2016/2017 Service Change package as revised and summarized in Attachment A resulting in an annualized cost savings of approximately $1,337,000 and, further, to authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is impacted by these changes.

DISCUSSION

To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance, sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different classes of service have different expectations of performance.  We will continue adjusting services in response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. It is also our responsibility to identify services that are underperforming and recommend modifications, curtailment or cancellation of service as warranted. The proposals herein include a mix of service adjustments and reductions. Based upon current and past ridership performance Route 116 Limited is proposed to be discontinued. Also related to its ridership performance, the Highlands Ranch Call-n-Ride is proposed to be continued contingent upon discovery of alternative funding from sources outside RTD. Additionally, service reductions on the W Line (light rail) are proposed in an effort to match the level of service and expense to current ridership demands. We will monitor customer response to the implementation of these service changes and propose adjustments and service alternatives as appropriate in future service change recommendations.

The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:

- Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;

- The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;

- The availability of alternative services to affected riders;

- Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to enhance service when possible;

- Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and

- Response to changes in the communities where services are provided

SUMMARY OF PUBLIC HEARINGS

Eight public hearings were held in Aurora, Brighton, Denver, Highlands Ranch, Ken Caryl, Lakewood, and Stapleton Denver at the Blake Administration building. Comments and further details from these meetings and the service change website are summarized in Attachment B of this report.

CHANGES TO INITIAL RECOMMENDATIONS

Staff receives input during the public comment process and continues to conduct additional analysis after the initial service recommendations are communicated to the Board of Directors. Depending on the outcome of the public comment process and continued analysis, staff may or may not propose modifications to these initial recommendations. The following proposals have been significantly modified:

Route 89 – Stapleton/Anschutz Campus: the proposal to discontinue this route has been rescinded.

Highlands Ranch call-n-Ride: the proposal to discontinue the Call-n-Ride, has been modified and is contingent upon funding alternatives.

SUMMARY OF PROPOSED SERVICE CHANGES

Routes proposed for service reductions:

Route 40 – Colorado Boulevard: discontinue the 6:32pm northbound trip from Colorado Center

Route 89 – Stapleton/Anschutz Campus:  proposal to discontinue service rescinded

Route 116L – Ken Caryl Limited:  discontinues service on the Route 116L, due to very low ridership.

Route 169L – Buckley Road/Denver Airport: discontinue 7:10pm southbound trip daily and 5:10pm southbound trip on Saturday and Sunday only.

Highlands Ranch call-n-Ride: continue the Call-n-Ride, contingent upon alternative funding

RockiesRide: discontinue all but two RockiesRide bus services

W Line (FasTracks): discontinue 16 Monday-Friday trips in the AM and PM peak periods

Routes proposed for mixed service improvements/service reductions:

Route 324 – Main Street Crosstown:  reroute of service currently on St. Vrain School District property

Route R/RC/RX – Brighton/ Denver; Brighton/Denver Express: renaming of route

Routes proposed for routine running time analysis/schedule adjustments

Route 15 – East Colfax: running time analysis

Rail Lines proposed for routine schedule adjustments:

Minor running time adjustments are proposed for all light rail lines: C, D, E, F, H, and W Lines, on all service days.

FINANCIAL IMPACT

The overall financial impact contained in this proposal includes a cost reduction of $962,000 from FasTracks and $375,000 cost saving from the base system, for a total savings of approximately $1,337,000 annualized.

EQUITY ANALYSIS

The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Executive Order 12898 regarding Environmental Justice. In this circular, the FTA requires RTD to evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that exceed the established major service change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a disproportionately negative impact on minority or low-income populations. Our evaluation of the proposed Winter 2016/2017 service changes does not reveal any disparities in impacts absorbed by minority or low-income populations.

A Look Ahead – May 2017

L – Line

A proposed solution to D Line on-time performance issues and consequentially, overall light rail system performance, this proposal introduces a modification to current D Line operations. The L  Line adds a new 30th& Downing to 14th Street Loop (Downtown) movement, replacing the D Line service between 30th & Downing Station and 19th Street. More extensive information regarding this proposal will be made available in a future update to the Board of Directors.

Motion:               Director Bagley made the motion to approve the Proposed Winter 2016/2017 Service Changes.

Director Anderson seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Director Lasater said he would like to give some insight to the possible incoming Director from District H.  He stated that about this time last year, the Parker Call-n-Ride was on the chopping block.  Eugene Howard came up with the funds and Parker established a taskforce to increase ridership, but Highlands Ranch has not been as fortunate.  He highly encouraged the new Director for District H to find solutions in Highlands Ranch because this is not the first time the Highlands Ranch Call-n-Ride has been up for service cuts.  He added that he appreciates Douglas County and their willingness to fund a portion of the service.

Director Bagley remarked that he has been on the Board for seven years and ten months and the Highlands Ranch Call-n-Ride has always had issues meeting the service standards requirements.  He stated that he has met with Commissioner Partridge, and there is time over the next month to have further conversations with Douglas County.  He commented that this is the highest cost Call-n-Ride and asked Bruce Abel to discuss the current state of the Call-n-Ride service.

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, said the initial staff recommendation was for the cancellation of the Highlands Ranch Call-n-Ride.  After several conversations, staff revised the recommendation, which is included in the Board Packet this evening.  He added that the Highlands Ranch Call-n-Ride Service is contingent upon the receipt of 50% of the operating costs from Douglas County, or another source outside of RTD.

Director Francone asked if there was a timeline for Douglas County to provide the funds.

Bruce Abel stated that the service changes are for winter, so staff would need to be informed of Douglas County’s decision by the end of November.

Director Lubow asked what happens if Douglas County is not able to raise half of the cost need to keep the Highlands Ranch Call-n-Ride, and inquired if there were any creative ways to address the funding issue.

Bruce Abel said in order to keep the service, RTD needs to receive half of the cost of the service from Douglas County, or another entity.

Director Menten stated this has been a problematic route and inquired if this was the first time RTD has asked for joint funding to keep a route on the schedule.

Bruce Abel remarked that RTD has participated in cost sharing with Douglas County, but those agreements were for at time certain and are no longer in place.

Director Menten commented that if Douglas County and their partners do not come to agreeable terms, and are subsequently unable to provide half of the funding to keep the Call-n-Ride, we can remove this service.

Bruce Abel reiterated if the action item is approved, the continuation of the Highlands Ranch Call-n-Ride is contingent upon the receipt of 50% of the operating costs for that service.

Motion:               Director Anderson made the motion to approve the Authorization to enter into contract with Protran Technology for purchase of Railway Worker Protection Early Warning System (16DR0003).

Director Sisk seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Director Bagley stated that after his experience on the rail simulator, it is imperative that the Board vote for this.  He remarked that the maintenance of way workers need to be protected.

Director Solano commented that initially, he voted no on this item, but he will support it tonight.  He added that it is critical for RTD’s rail workers to have the protections they need.

Chair Tobiassen declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

### D. Transfer FasTracks Sales and Use Tax Revenues in Excess of Forecasted Sales and Use Tax Revenues to FasTracks Internal Savings Account

It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors approve transferring FasTracks sales and use tax revenues (.4%) from unrestricted fund balance to the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) on an annual basis when actual sales and use tax revenues (.4%) collected for the calendar year exceed the forecasted sales and use tax revenues (.4%) projected in the adopted budget each year.  The actual sales and use tax revenues will be determined based on the audited financial statements.

Motion:               Director Folska made the motion to approve the Transfer of FasTracks Sales and Use Tax Revenues in Excess of Forecasted Sales and Use Tax Revenues to FasTracks Internal Savings Account.

Director Solano seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Director Anderson asked if the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) can be used for all of the items on the original FasTracks Ballot, such as construction, service and operations.

General Manager Genova said yes.  He added that originally, the FISA resolution was for the unfunded corridors and it requires that all FasTracks money is to be used on FasTracks projects.

Director Anderson stated that she is concerned that there will be another deep recession similar to 2008.  She commented that she never wants to cut service unless something drastic happens, and she will support this if in the future, the funds will be applied to operations.

Director Menten commented that she will be voting no on this item.  She said this is tying our hands and she would prefer more flexibility in the future.

Vote on

The Motion:              The motion passed with 13 in favor (Anderson, Archuleta, Bagley, Folska, Francone, Hoy, James, Lasater, Lubow, Sisk, Solano, Tobiassen, Walker) and 1 opposed (Menten).  Director Deadwyler was absent.

Chair Tobiassen declared the motion PASSED.

## XIII. Executive Session

There was no Executive Session.

## XIV. Old Business

Director Lasater remarked that at the meet and greet with the Denver City Council, he and Director Francone brought up the need for temporary shelters at Civic Center Park, since Civic Center is under renovation.  He stated that Anthony Graves at the Mayor’s Office is seeing what options are available, and he encouraged staff to work with the City to protect our riders from the winter weather.

General Manager Genova indicated that staff continues to work very closely with the City of Denver and RTD has shelters in stock and are ready to go as soon as we get the City’s approval.

Director Folska directed the Board and staff to her website, and to her book, Making ¢ of Pedestrian Oriented Developments, which explicitly outlines how the Yale and Southmoor Stations were failures.  She said it is an interesting issue and read.
