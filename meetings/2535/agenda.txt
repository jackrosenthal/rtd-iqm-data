A.
Budget Transfer for SH 119 Bus Rapid Transit Environmental Clearance and Basic
Engineering
It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the RTD
Board of Directors approve a transfer of $3.5 million from the Planning expense grant
project budget to a new capital project for the SH 119 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT)
Corridor, which will permit staff to seek consultant services for assistance in the
preparation of National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review and Advanced Basic
Engineering services. A total of $1.5 million in funding for this project was approved in
the 2016 Amended Budget in the Planning expense grant budget, and the remaining
funds are planned for 2017 and 2018 in the 2017-2022 Strategic Budget Plan (SBP).
B.

Proposed Winter 2016/2017 Service Changes

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of
Directors approve the Winter 2016/2017 Service Change package as revised and
summarized in Attachment A resulting in an annualized cost savings of approximately
$1,337,000 and, further, to authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute
contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is impacted by
these changes.
C.
Authorization to enter into contract with Protran Technology for purchase of
Railway Worker Protection Early Warning System (16DR0003)

Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to enter into a contract not to
exceed $1,500,000 with Protran Technology for the purchase of a Railway Worker
Protection Early Warning System and associated equipment (Contract Number 16DR003).
D.
Transfer FasTracks Sales and Use Tax Revenues in Excess of Forecasted Sales and
Use Tax Revenues to FasTracks Internal Savings Account
It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the RTD
Board of Directors approve transferring FasTracks sales and use tax revenues (.4%)
from unrestricted fund balance to the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) on an
annual basis when actual sales and use tax revenues (.4%) collected for the calendar
year exceed the forecasted sales and use tax revenues (.4%) projected in the adopted
