BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Refinance Lease Purchase Agreements for Interest Savings

Committee Meeting Date:
August 17, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
August 17, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the RTD Board of Directors to adopt Resolution Number __, Series 2021 (the “Resolution”), to
amend the 2016 and 2017 lease purchase agreements with JP Morgan Chase Bank, NA to realize
interest rate savings.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVES
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
Brenden Morgan, Senior Manager of Debt and Investments
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
In 2016, the Regional Transportation District (RTD) entered into a lease purchase agreement involving JP
Morgan Chase Bank, NA, to refinance previously outstanding certificates of participation (COPs) in order
to obtain lower interest rates. The 2016 lease purchase agreement has an approximate $25.7 million
balance remaining to be paid and is part of RTD’s Base System. The 2016 lease purchase agreement
may be prepaid at any time and the final payment is scheduled for 2022.
In 2017, RTD entered into a lease purchase agreement involving JP Morgan Chase Bank, NA, to
refinance previously outstanding COPs in order to obtain lower interest rates. Approximately $152.5
million ($109.2 million Base System and $43.3 million FasTracks) of this lease purchase agreement
remains to be paid. The 2017 lease purchase agreement may be prepaid at any time and the final
payment is scheduled for 2025.
These 2016 and 2017 lease purchase agreements refinanced the COPs that were issued to purchase
light rail vehicles and buses.
DISCUSSION
RTD approached JP Morgan Chase Bank regarding the 2016 and 2017 lease purchase agreements due
to the current low interest rate environment and the potential interest rate savings to be realized by
RTD if both parties agreed to amend the agreements. JP Morgan Chase Bank was very interested in
amending the lease purchase agreements and offered competitive interest rates and terms that were
better than the District could obtain through the sale of refinancing COPs in the marketplace.
Amending the existing leases is also less expensive than the alternatives as RTD will incur minimal
legal fees, and not incur any rating agency fees or bank underwriting fees.
The Resolution allows for the refinancing of the 2016 and 2017 lease purchase agreements (the
“Leases”) for interest savings. The related contractual documents required to effectuate the refinancings
are identified in the Resolution and include:

•

First Amendment to 2016 Lease Purchase Agreement
First Amendment to 2017 Lease Purchase Agreement
Resolution of RTD to amend the Lease Purchase Agreements

The Resolution delegates to the General Manager or the Chief Financial Officer the authority to accept a
proposal from JP Morgan Chase Bank, NA, for a reduced rate of interest on the Leases provided that the
rate of interest must be lower than the interest rate currently in the Leases.
RTD is receiving the advice of Hilltop Securities as independent financial advisor and Butler Snow LLP as
bond counsel regarding this transaction.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Current market conditions could create savings to RTD of approximately $4 million between 2021 and
2025 (2.6% net present value savings). This is below the 3% minimum savings identified in the RTD
Fiscal Policy, however, given the short-term nature of these Leases and low cost to execute the
transaction, the savings is appropriate. Costs of the refinancing would include legal fees and are
expected to be less than $5,000.
