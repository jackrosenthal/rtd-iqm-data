Subject:

Construction Award for IFB 37-DE 001. East
Metro HVAC and Building Automation Controls
Upgrade Project

General

Board Meeting Date: April 17, 2018

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to award a contract to JCOR Mechanical Inc. in the
amount of $2,840,224 for the East Metro HVAC and Building Automation Controls Upgrade Project. It is
further recommended that the General Manager or his designee be authorized to transfer $551,222 from
the Base System Contingency funds to the East Metro HVAC and Building Automation Controls Upgrade
Project. Funding for the contract and the transfer are included in the 2018 budget.
This Recommended Action supports the General Manger’s 2018 goal - Task Goal #3 – Asset
Management/State of Good Repair.
BACKGROUND
The East Metro maintenance and storage facility was constructed in 1979 - 1980 and opened for
operations in September of 1980. The facility is approximately 351,000 square feet and is comprised of
bus maintenance, bus storage, administrative offices and driver support areas.
DISCUSSION
RTD’s East Metro Facility has a total of 17 Supply Air Units (SAU) on the roof that serve the
maintenance and bus storage areas. Four (4) SAUs were replaced in October 1986 by Colorado Piping &
Mechanical and are to be replaced under the scope of this project due to the structural integrity of the
units, availability of parts and issues with maintainability. Six (6) SAUs were replaced in 1995 by AMI
Mechanical, Inc. and remain in good condition with some repair work scheduled to be completed under
the scope of this project. Seven (7) SAUs were replaced by JCOR Mechanical Inc. in 2010 and are in
very good condition. An outside air intake hood is being provided for each of these units as part of this
project to improve the integrity and longevity of the air filters in the SAUs. Two (2) existing air handling
units (AHU) serving the south Drivers End / Administration area are 25 years old and are to be replaced
under the scope of this project due to the condition of the units, availability of parts and issues with
maintainability. The East Metro Facility existing Building Automation System (BAS) is 25 to 38 years old
and has become inefficient and unmaintainable due to the availability of replacement parts. It is to be
replaced under the scope of this project. The bus maintenance tailpipe exhaust system is also to be
replaced under the scope of this project to better control bus tailpipe exhaust air rates and improve
energy efficiency.
BID OUTCOME
The Invitation For Bid (IFB) was advertised on January 31, 2018. Bids were received and opened on
March 6, 2018. Due to the great demand for this type of work in the Denver construction market, both
the bids exceeded the approved budget. After reviewing the Scope of Work and the bids, the low bid
has been deemed appropriate. The two bidders are proposed in the following manner.

1. JCOR Mechanical Inc.2. Ward Construction

-

$2,840,224
$3,334,000

SBE/DBE INVOLVEMENT
The SBE goal was 5%. JCOR Mechanical Inc., being a certified SBE contractor, will have the capacity to
exceed the goal.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
All funding is local and is in the approved 2018 Budget. In order to award the project to the lowest
bidder, JCOR Mechanical, Inc., we need to transfer $551,222 from the Base System Contingency Fund
into the approved budgeted line item. Over the past year there has been unprecedented price increases
that are affecting the local building industry.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to award a contract to JCOR Mechanical
Inc. in the amount of $2,840,224 for the East Metro HVAC and Building Automation Controls
Upgrade Project. It is further recommended that the General Manager or his designee be
authorized to transfer $551,222 from the Base System Contingency funds to the East Metro
HVAC and Building Automation Controls Upgrade Project. Funding for the contract and the
transfer are included in the 2018 Budget.
2. Do Not Accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager or his designee
to award a contract to JCOR Mechanical Inc. in the amount of $2,840,224 for the East Metro
HVAC and Building Automation Controls Upgrade Project. Further, do not recommend that the
General Manager or his designee be authorized to transfer $551,222 from the General Manager’s
contingency funds to the East Metro HVAC and Building Automation Controls Upgrade Project.
The project shall be reduced in scope and re-advertised. Reducing the scope of the project will
not keep pace with the long-term State of Good Repair Goals required for the East Metro Facility.

Subject:

Architectural / Engineering Contract with Short
Elliot Hendrickson (SEH), Contract 16 FO-017 Contract Amendment #2

General

Board Meeting Date: April 17, 2018

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager to amend Contract 16 FO-017 with SEH to allow for additional
architectural / engineering design services in the amount of $2,000,000 for a new, not-to-exceed
Contract amount of $2,603,096.91. Work is administered on an as-needed, work order basis. Funding
for this Contract will be included in the individual approved project budgets.
This Recommended Action supports two of the General Manger’s 2018 goals. 1- Core Goal #1 Successful Delivery of Transit Services. 2 - Task Goal #3 – Asset Management/State of Good Repair.
BACKGROUND
This Board Action is to increase the existing not-to-exceed limit in the Contract. All other terms and
conditions of the Contract remain unchanged. Services rendered under this Contract provide mechanical,
civil, architectural, electrical, structural, and landscaping, design and engineering services for the
development of selected projects included in RTD's SBP Program and grant funded projects. The
Contract duration was specified for a three year term from November 01, 2016 to November 01, 2019
with award being in the amount of $453,096.91. To date one Amendment in the amount of $150,000
has been added to the Contract for a current not-to-exceed value of $603,096.91 Allowable, are two,
one-year extensions to the Contract. Exercising the two, one-year extensions brings the duration of the
contract to November 01, 2021.
DISCUSSION
Consultant responsibilities include preparation of drawings and specifications, in addition to estimating
and other construction related services as defined in their original Scope of Work. The purpose of this
Contract Amendment is to assist the Capital Programs Department with design services that cannot be
completed with in-house staff. To date, six Work Orders have been written for a total value of
$574,074. The additional $2,000,000 is an estimated value anticipated for the design support needed
for stand up of the North Metro Operations, system wide civil improvements, and facility renovations
including mechanical, electrical, and tenant finishes across the District.
SBE/DBE INVOLVEMENT
The DBE goal for this contract is set at 10%. To date, the consultant is at 22.3%.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
This Contract utilizes grant and local funds. The type of funds are dependent upon the funding source of
each individual project. Individual work orders will be funded from the budgets of the projects where the
work will be performed.

2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to amend
Contract 16 FO-017 with SEH to allow for additional architectural/ engineering design services in
the amount of $2,000,000 for a new, not-to-exceed contract amount of $2,603,096.91. Instead,
proceed with the implementation of a new Architectural / Engineering RFP for a contract with a
new consultant team. This is not recommended because of the delay it will cause on all 2018
projects requiring these services.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the Board of Directors
pass the attached Property Acquisition Resolution certifying property as necessary for the construction
of the North Metro Commuter Rail Project and authorize staff to process with all requisite legal process
under state eminent domain law. Funding of this acquisition is included in the 2018 Adopted Budget for
the North Metro Project.
This Recommended Action supports the General Manager’s 2018 goals - Core Goal #1 – Successful
Delivery of Transit Services
BACKGROUND
RTD must obtain possession of and make available to the contractor for the North Metro Commuter Rail
Project the right of way necessary for the construction of the project. Property needs have been
identified and specific legal descriptions prepared and all acquisitions certified by the Board by
Resolutions in September 2011, June 2013, March 2014 and March 2016 have been acquired. An
additional property interest has been identified by the contractor as required for construction of the
North Metro Commuter Rail Project
DISCUSSION
State and Federal law mandate that specific procedures be followed in the acquisition of property for a
public project when the acquiring governmental entity has the power of eminent domain. RTD staff and
its outside counsel and property acquisition consultants are familiar with and adhere to these processes,
which commence with offer and good faith negotiations, but may result in court filing and eminent
domain proceedings to resolve property acquisitions. The attached Resolution and right of way plan
tabulation sheets specify the additional property that has been delineated by design and authorized the
General Manager and/or the Project Manager to certify specific legal descriptions of the needed
properties.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for this right of way acquisition is included in the 2018 Adopted Budget for the North Metro
project.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Pass the attached Resolution. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the
Board of Directors pass the attached Property Acquisition Resolution certifying property as necessary

Date:

March 28, 2018

Subject:

RTD Director District Precinct Assignment

Assistant

General

Board Meeting Date: April 17, 2018

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning, Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the revised Director District boundary between Director District E and Director District G so that
all of Arapahoe County Precinct Number 234 falls within Director District E, which has a lower
population than District G.
This recommendation addresses General Manager 2018 Core Goal #3: Strong Financial Management:
Oversees operating and FasTracks budgets, ensures compliance with local, state, and federal reporting,
and development of financing plans for future projects.
BACKGROUND
On February 21, 2012, in accordance with CRS 32-9-111(1)(a), the Board approved a revised Director
District map to reflect changes in the District’s population as reflected in the 2010 Census. Per CRS 329-111(1)(a), individual Director Districts must be comprised of whole general election precincts, as
established by the boards of county commissioners of those counties wholly or partially within the
district and by the election commission of the City and County of Denver and the City and County of
Broomfield. CRS 32-9-111(1)(a) also requires that “the fifteen directors will represent, to the extent
practical, the people of the district on the basis of population”. While the statute does not provide
specific population requirements, the Board Redistricting Committee established a threshold of five
percent deviation from the average Director District population. At the time of redistricting, the
population of District E was 173,503 while the population of District G was 179,331. The mean
Director District population was 177,847.
From time to time, the individual counties adjust precinct boundaries. Usually, the adjusted precincts
remain completely within individual Director Districts; however, Arapahoe County has adjusted its
precincts so that Precinct Number 234, all of which was previously in Director District G (Director
Mihalik), now falls across the boundary of District G into District E (Director Folska). See attached map.
While a majority of the precinct’s land area lies within District G, a majority of the precinct’s population
is within District E. Furthermore, given uneven growth rates since the 2010 Census, the estimated
population of District G is now approximately 10,000 greater than that of District E (District G: 210,290
vs. District E: 200,470). The precinct in question straddles I-25 in the vicinity of Arapahoe Road. In
order to change the Director District boundaries, the Board must take action.
DISCUSSION
CRS 32-9-111(1)(a) states the following: “No general election precinct may be split into two or more
director districts.” Arapahoe County’s new precinct map places Precinct Number 234 over the boundary
of District E (Director Folska) and District G (Director Mihalik). In order to conform to statute, the Board
must adjust the Director District boundaries so that the new precinct lies exclusively in one Director
District.

Packet Pg. 14

1.B.4

If the Director District boundaries were adjusted to include all of Precinct Number 234 into District E
(already the smaller of the two Districts in question), the population of that Director District’s population
would increase by approximately 570. If the precinct were instead assigned to District G (the larger of
the two Districts in question), that District District’s population would increase by approximately 1,370,
which would make for an even larger population gap between the two districts.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with this action.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action by the Planning, Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that
the Board of Directors approve the revised Director District boundary between Director District E
and Director District G so that all of Arapahoe County Precinct Number 234 falls within Director
District E, which has a lower population than District G.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee
that the Board of Directors and do not approve the revised Director District boundary between
Director District E and Director District G so that all of Arapahoe County Precinct Number 234 falls
within Director District E, which has a lower population than District G. Instead, the Board could
expand Director District G to encompass the entirety of Precinct Number 234, which would expand
that Director District’s population by approximately 570.
