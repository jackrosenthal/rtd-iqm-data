### B. Citizens Advisory Committee

Committee Chair Hoy introduced Cynthia Stovall and Bob Rizzuto, FasTracks Citizen Advisory Committee (CAC) Co-chairs, who would be providing the Board with an update of their activities.

Cynthia Stovall shared that the CAC had a very exciting quarterly meeting at the Anschutz Medical Campus.  There was a presentation on I-225 and the East Rail Line as well as discussion related to the bus/rail connections.  There was also someone from CU who was working to establish their internal shuttle service for the campus and a representative for the VA.  She noted that there were students, faculty, staff, doctors, etc. as well as owners of the adjacent businesses in attendance.  Cynthia Stovall stated that the meeting was more focused on constituents’ concerns as opposed to the specific progress of the lines in the area.

Cynthia Stovall commented that this was one of the most well attended CAC meetings in terms of the constituents.  The CAC will be discussing this at their next monthly meeting to identify ways they can engage the constituents in the future.

Cynthia Stovall thanked the Directors for their participation in the 2-on-1 meetings.  It is very beneficial to hear the Directors concerns and understand the issues in their communities.

Cynthia Stovall recognized General Manager Washington for everything he has done for the region, but especially for his work with the CAC.  She said that he has been a great partner to work with and very involved with the CAC’s activities.

Committee Chair Hoy recognized that the meeting at Anschutz sounded very productive and was very uplifting for the CAC.  He is happy with the turnout from the community.

Director Folska inquired about the transportation solution provided by the VA for their medical center.  Cynthia Stovall stated that the VA did not have a solution so much as a conclusion that veterans would not be the ones using public transportation to get to their facility.  It would only be staff riding so navigating from the Rail Line to the entrance would not be a problem.  She explained that the University has submitted a grant application to run their own shuttle, but it would only serve their facilities, not the VA medical center.

Director Bagley mentioned that he recently had his 2-on-1 lunch with Melvin Bush and Tyler Kealy.  They shared with him the participation and discussions that occurred at the Anschutz meeting; he believes it is a great model for the CAC’s future outreach meetings.  Director Bagley recognized how engaged and interested both Melvin and Tyler are in the CAC’s activities and their concern for what will happen to the CAC in the future.  He stated that the entire Board is concerned about what happens to the CAC in the future as RTD finishes construction.

Director Tobiassen thanked Vivian Stovall and Deborah Wilcox for their time in meeting with him.  He appreciates everything the CAC is doing, especially journeying out to Anschutz for their quarterly meeting.  He said he was at the beginning of the meeting and the turnout was really amazing.

Committee Chair Hoy asked for further clarification about the shuttle that the University of Colorado (CU) was planning to operate; it was his understanding that CU indicated the shuttle would serve the entire area, not just the University, when the Board approved the re-alignment of the line.  He requested a copy of the letter that CU read at a Board meeting regarding the shuttle.  Rick Clarke, Assistant General Manager of Capital Programs, stated that staff would send the Board a copy of the letter.

Director Deadwyler expressed her appreciation that the Anschutz meeting ended up being more of a constituent focused meeting.  She recognized that people are concerned about what will happen to the CAC in the future; she does not think that RTD can let them disappear.  RTD needs to be using them to continue to get feedback from the constituents.

#### 1. Citizens Advisory Committee Update

#### 1. Station Names on North Metro Rail Line

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors accept and approve the revised final station names for the North Metro Rail Line:  48th & Brighton Blvd at National Western Center; Commerce City• 72nd; Northglenn•112th; Original Thornton•88th; Thornton Crossroads•104th; Eastlake•124th; York•144th; and North Thornton•Hwy 7.

Motion:              Chair Sisk made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the April 21, 2015 Board meeting.

Director Anderson seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Brenda Tierney, North Metro Line Community Involvement Project Manager, stated that during the Environmental Impact Statement process the station names were chosen for planning purposes.  She explained that at this point in the design each jurisdiction is given a copy of RTD’s station naming policy and we request their feedback.  She said that there were several requested changes from the jurisdictions, which were consistent with our policy, so staff is recommending that we accept the requests.

Director Lasater believes this might cause request from our southern communities related to the stations along their lines.  He wonders if we will work with them on any requests they might have to change the station names.  Brenda Tierney explained that the communities along the Southeast and Southwest line were provided with the same opportunity as those along the North Metro Line.  She stated that at this point they could make a request to change a name but there would be a cost to do so as we would need to change signage, maps, etc.

Chair Sisk noted that Denver is contributing funds in excess of the required local match.  He wondered if staff could tell him how much.  Chair Sisk also commended staff for working with the local governments to include them in the naming process.  He thinks this is a great way to garner community involvement.  Ashland Vaughn, North Metro Engineering Project Manager, stated that staff is currently working with Denver of a memorandum of understanding to finalize the details but they should be contributing around $4 million.

Director Menten stated that she does not agree with some of the changes requested by Thornton.  She expressed concern that these names are not easily recognizable to the everyday rider that is not familiar with Thornton.  She said that for this reason she will be voting no.  Brenda Tierney stated that Thornton had gone through an extensive vetting process of the names; they provided RTD with thorough explanations that made sense and fit with in the policy so staff accepted the requests.

Committee Chair Hoy noted that the Thornton names may not have significance for everyone but they are very significant for the people of Thornton.

Director Solano expressed concern over the Thornton names.  He feels they do not reflect the other communities in Adams County that the line will serve.  He stated that he will vote no.

Director Anderson said that she is in support of this motion; this is one way that RTD can demonstrate to our partners in the different communities that we listen to their input.  She thinks it is a great way to show our support for our partners.

Committee Chair Hoy declared the motion PASSED.

#### 1. Aurora Line/I-225 Rail Construction Update

Chuck Culig, I-225 Project Manager, reviewed a Power Point presentation with the Board that is available in the April 7, 2015 FasTracks Monitoring Committee Agenda Packet.  Chuck Culig said that the project is 56% complete.  The first substation has been installed, catenary poles and wire are being installed throughout Area A, and ballast and rail are being installed throughout Area B.  The Iliff Station is nearly complete and the Florida Avenue and 13th Avenue stations are progressing well.  Chuck Culig noted that all the light rail bridges are at least in some stage of construction but many are complete.  He shared that work has moved to the Aurora Metro City Center along Exposition, which is the area that will have the biggest impact on the public and the City.

Chuck Culig shared that his team is also working extensively on public information and outreach.  There are weekly closure/construction emails, stakeholder meetings, community presentations and various news stories and videos.  He said that the team will continue to do community/business meetings and presentations and will begin public tours on May 21.  There will also be a Celebrating Progress Event on April 30 that all Directors are invited to.

Chuck Culig pointed out that the SBE Participation Goal for Kiewit is 25%.  Their commitment to-date is 27% so they are on track to exceed the goal.  He noted there are 170 SBE firms on the I-225 line totaling approximately $59 million in payments to-date.  Chuck Culig said that in addition to the SBE firms there are 137 WIN participants working on the project.

Committee Chair Hoy thanked him for his presentation.  He said it is always exciting to see things actually happening with girders being set and rail being laid.

Director Folska said she appreciates Chuck Culig’s thorough presentations and really enjoys working with him.  She also appreciates the safety efforts of the entire team.  Director Folska noted that recently there was a problem with a substation that caused a domino effect, resulting in all of our train lines being down.  She wondered what lessons we have learned from that outage that can be incorporated on the I-225 Line.  Rick Clarke recognized that there was a cascading failure of the substations last week; the engineers are working to pinpoint the cause but it was an anomaly that should not have happened.

Director Tobiassen commended the I-225 project team for their work, especially the Public Information people.  They are everywhere, all the time, attending public meetings, fare studies, etc.  He commented that the City of Aurora has been incredibly helpful as well with the Channel 8 weekly TV updates.  Aurora is also in the process of hiring a parking manager, recognizing that they will probably need parking in addition to that provided by RTD.  He said that there has really been a lot of community involvement up and down the entire corridor.

Director Anderson shared that it had been quite some time since she was in the area but she was very impressed with the work that was going on when she drove through there recently.  She thanked Kiewit for their safety record and commitment to the SBE and WIN participation.

Director Lasater inquired about the track alignment near Peoria and Fitzsimons.  He said that it appears the track flyover will end up running into some of the buildings of the storage facility in the area.  He recognized the great work the entire team was doing on the project.  Chuck Culig explained that eventually some of the buildings would be torn down but the relocation process took time.  He said that construction should begin again on the flyover shortly.

Director Deadwyler shared that a few weeks ago she was concerned that this project might not finish on-time; however, she drove by the other day and saw a lot of work happening, so she was very impressed.  She pointed out that the bridge going over Colfax has been constructed but there is nothing connected to either end.  She inquired when that would happen so Colfax could be reopened.  Chuck Culig stated that Colfax is closed due to a CDOT project, which is the reason we built the bridge well before we were ready to connect it to the track.

Director Menten inquired if there were any quiet zones along the line.  She reminded everyone that there were some issues with this along the West Line; she believes it would be better to address this as part of the planning rather than when the line is operational.  Director Menten wonders what the Morris Heights Neighborhood Association’s concerns are.  Chuck Culig noted that staff is having a follow-up meeting with them and he will provide Director Menten with details after the meeting.

Committee Chair Hoy thanked Chuck Culig for such a positive, upbeat update.
