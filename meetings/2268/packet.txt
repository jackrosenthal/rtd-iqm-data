Subject:

Station Names on North Metro Rail Line

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors accept and
approve the revised final station names for the North Metro Rail Line: 48th & Brighton Blvd at National
Western Center; Commerce City• 72nd; Northglenn•112th; Original Thornton•88th; Thornton
Crossroads•104th; Eastlake•124th; York•144th; and North Thornton•Hwy 7.
BACKGROUND
Station names were originally assigned to locations based on geographic locations during the North
Metro Corridor Environmental Impact Statement (2007 – 2011) and have been used on plans, fact
sheets and the website ever since. During final design, final station names are required for station
signage and related purposes. The following requests were received from the local jurisdictions of
Denver, Commerce City, Northglenn and Thornton.
It is important that station names are recognizable as destinations to RTD patrons. This enables travelers
to easily identify station locations and to efficiently complete trips. Staff recommends station names
that are readily recognizable and make sense for the location while following RTD policy and precedents.
DISCUSSION
The City and County of Denver requested the station at National Western Stock Show be changed to
National Western Center. The City and County of Denver is contributing funds toward the North Metro
Rail Line over and above the required local match. While the National Western Stock Show and National
Western Complex are trademarked names of private entities, the National Western Center is not. In
addition, the intent of the City and County of Denver is to be heavily involved in the “National Western
Center” development in the near future.
Staff Recommendation: Change to 48th & Brighton at National Western Center
This solution fits directly into the current station naming policy of naming stations after cross
streets as well as naming after a publicly recognized location.
The City of Commerce City requested that the 72nd Avenue station be changed it to Commerce CityEast 72nd Avenue.
Staff Recommendation: Change to “Commerce City•72nd”
This solution names Commerce City in the station and includes a cross street in accordance with
the station naming policy. Staff recommends the “East” and the “Avenue” be dropped since no
other stations include a direction or street type designation. It also follows a precedent set at
Littleton•Mineral and Lakewood•Wadsworth stations on other existing lines.

The City of Northglenn
Northglenn•112th Avenue

requested

that the 112th Avenue station

names be changed

to

Staff Recommendation: Change to “Northglenn•112th”
This solution names Northglenn in the station and includes a cross street in accordance with the
station naming policy. Staff recommends the “Avenue” be dropped since no other stations
include a direction for street type designation. It also follows a precedent set at Littleton•Mineral
and Lakewood•Wadsworth stations on other existing lines where names of cities are added into
station names.
The City of Thornton requested the following station names:
1. Changing “88th” to “Original Thornton at 88th”
This is the first station in Thornton so including the name of the City is appropriate. Using
‘Original Thornton’ gives recognition to the adjoining area where Thornton began.
2. Changing “104th” to “Thornton Crossroads at 104th”
This station is located where two important roads intersect, Colorado Boulevard and 104th
Avenue. Colorado Boulevard runs through the center of Thornton and extends far north into Weld
County and 104th is an important access route to DIA from communities in the northern part of
the metro area.
3. Changing “ 124th-Eastlake” to “Eastlake at 124th”
The Town of Eastlake, now incorporated into Thornton, is a strong historic and geographic
reference point for this station. Eastlake was one of the stops on the original Union Pacific rail
line.
4. Changing “144th” to “York at 144th
York Street and 144th Avenue intersect close to the station and provide a geographic reference
point for this station name.
5. Changing “162nd/Hwy 7” to “North Thornton at Hwy 7”
This station name reflects the fact that the station is located at the northern end of the line and
at the northern boundary of Thornton.
Staff Recommendation: Change to the following – Original Thornton•88th; Thornton
Crossroads•104th; Eastlake•124th; York•144th; and North Thornton•Hwy 7.
Each of the suggestions from the City of Thornton makes sense and fits within the station
naming policy. Staff recommends changing the “at” to a bullet to conform to RTD standards.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact at this time, however decisions need to be made prior to final design
completion so signage and systems set up can be completed with final station names.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee
that the Board of Directors accept and approve the revised final station names for the North
Metro Rail Line: 48th & Brighton Blvd at National Western Center; Commerce City• 72nd;
Northglenn•112th; Original Thornton•88th; Thornton Crossroads•104th; Eastlake•124th;
York•144th; and North Thornton•Hwy 7.
2. Do not accept the recommended action. Instead leave the names as defined in the EIS. This is not
recommended as it would not be responsive to key stakeholders making the request.
