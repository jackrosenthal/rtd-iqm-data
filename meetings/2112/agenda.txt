Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) between the Sand Creek Metropolitan

purpose of coordinating to provide a grade separation from 40 th Avenue on
the East Corridor alignment near the proposed 40 th/Airport Station. The IGA
describes the terms of, and schedule for, coordination between RTD and the
SCMD. The IGA provides for the inclusion of a grade-separated crossing in
the East Corridor project if funding for the additional cost can be secured by
SCMD, and if SCMD provides for the lowering of 40 th Avenue.

E.

Directors authorize the Interim General Manager to execute all documents
necessary to award the first year option, for the amount not to exceed of
$200,000, for Senior IT Oracle Database services. The contract (28DJ024) was
originally awarded January 2009 to Sol-IT, an SBE/DBE firm, through the
competitive bid process. The contract allowed for an initial-year plus two (2)
one-year options to renew based on positive performance by the vendor. The
contract is being brought to the Board because it is a Personal Services contract

G.

Salaried Employee Insured Benefits
It is recommended by the Financial/Administration Committee that the Board of
Directors approve the 2010 Plan Year Salaried Insured Benefits Program and
authorize the Interim General Manager to enter into an agreement with the
Insurance Carriers. This represents a potential cost savings to the District of
$526,553 (or 8.5%) less than the 2009 projected benefit plan cost.

H.

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the
Board of Directors authorize the Interim General Manager or his designee, to

provision of access-a-Ride paratransit services in order to incorporate an option
for the provision of access-a-Ride service for the period January 1, 2010 thru
December 31, 2010. This contract amendment will be for one year in an amount
not to exceed $5,059,742.00. There will still be two (2) additional one year
options. This amendment will bring the three (3) year contract total with Global
Transportation to a maximum that shall not exceed $13,185,321 for the period
January 1, 2008- December 31, 2010. The amounts for the remaining two (2)
one-year options shall not exceed $5,600,616 for the 2011 option year and
$6,205,151 for the 2012 option year. The combined total amounts for this
contract, including all option years, shall not exceed $24,991,088 for the five
year period. In addition, RTD will reimburse the contractors’ direct fuel costs in
amounts estimated to total approximately $2,457,532 for the initial three year
period and $4,445,115 for the five year period. This results in combined contract
totals not to exceed $15,642,853 in total for the initial three year period (20082010) and $29,436,203 for the five year period 2008-1012.
