Board Meeting
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: --is OK [INAUDIBLE].
All right. Good evening. I will now call the Tuesday, October 26 RTD Board meeting to order. We are
convened as of 5:30 PM Mountain Daylight Time. I would respectfully ask everyone to remain muted
unless you are recognized to speak.
Thank you all for joining us this evening. And please note that the official meetings of the RTD Board of
Directors are being held remotely in the interest of public health, safety, and welfare. The official meetings
of the Board of Directors will be held via Zoom and will be audio and video recorded. The meeting
recordings, along with the unofficial minutes of the meetings, will be posted as soon as practicable on the
Board's website. Visit rtd-denver.com, and a livestream of this meeting is also available via RTD YouTube
page.
I'd like to start with our civility statement. Colleagues, being elected as a member of this body imposes an
ethical obligation for each of us to enhance and maintain the public confidence in this agency. As a Board
of Directors, it is our collective duty to our constituents, stakeholders, and staff to conduct our business in
an atmosphere of mutual respect, cooperation, civility, trust, and collegiality. These are the values we can
all agree upon. As such, I encourage each of us to review the operating guidelines adopted by this Board
and to act in accordance with those principles, which are available on the Board of Directors page on the
RTD website. Thank you.
This evening I'd like to ask Director Bouquet to please lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance. Director
Bouquet.
JULIEN BOUQUET: Thank you, Madam Chair. Am I coming in OK?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes.
JULIEN BOUQUET: Apologies, having a couple technical issues. All right. Start us off.
IN UNISON: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which
it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. Director Whitmore, would you please lead us in the land
acknowledgment?
TROY WHITMORE: My pleasure, Madam Chair. The RTD Board of Directors acknowledges the land on
which our buses and trains operate is a traditional territory of the Ute, Cheyenne, Arapaho, and other
contemporary tribal nations that are historically tied to these lands. We honor our indigenous elders who

have traveled, inhabited, and stewarded these mountains, hills, and plains throughout many generations.
May this acknowledgment demonstrate a commitment to working to dismantle the ongoing legacies of
inequity of the Native and all historically oppressed peoples and recognize their current and future
contributions in the District as we move forward.

At RTD, safety is paramount and I'd like to begin this meeting with a very short safety briefing. The Transit
Security Administration, the TSA, has extended the federal mask requirement for public transportation
until January 18, 2022. The federal mask requirement states that individuals must wear a face covering
while waiting for and while riding in public transportation, to include airports, aircraft, train stations and
trains, bus stops and buses.
This evening, there are no retiree awards. However, the Board would like to recognize the winners of the
RTD Snowplow Rodeo, which was held in August, and the National Snowplow Rodeo, that was held in
September. Our staff has invited the rodeo winners this evening to join us, and we would like to
congratulate them on their achievement. Mr. Stopplecamp, before you introduce the winners, can you just
describe the rodeos and the competition process so everyone can have a great understanding of this
amazing achievement for our team.
HENRY STOPPLECAMP: Well, first, thank you, Madam Chair. It'd be my pleasure to talk about the
snowplow rodeo. First thing, there was no snow for either rodeos, but that's a different story.
I'd like to thank Ron Posey and Tom Garza of my staff that put on the rodeo and also General Manager
and CEO Johnson and the Board for helping support this endeavor for our employees. Our General
Manager, along with yourself, Director Williams and Director Catlin were present for the RTD rodeo on the
27th of August.

So the rodeo itself is a three-part competition, a two-person team. And those two people are responsible,
one will do a written test that goes over rules and regulations, one will do a pre-trip inspection, and then
both of them hop in the truck and they run it through an obstacle course. The first part is in reverse and a
serpentine around a series of cones into a loading dock, and then they pull out of the loading dock going
forward, getting as close to the cones as possible without hitting. And then halfway through, they switch
over and jump out, run around the truck, hop back in and race to the finish line.
And you've got basically three minutes for the single axle and five minutes for the double axle. Single axle
is a smaller truck, but it's still a pretty good sized truck with a snowplow on it. And I think Miss Johnson
can attest to that. But a lot of fun, a lot of challenges. And this is made up of the Capital Programs team
and preliminary, the FM folks that are doing the snow removal for RTD in the wintertime. So these are the
folks that are driving the plows up and down US-36 on the slip ramps, around some of our Park-n-Rides
and also at our facilities.
So in a nutshell, that's the course itself. It's graded on time and accuracy. And then the winners of the
tandem and the single axle then will go to the International Snow Plow Rodeo, which is held in Loveland
every year. And we didn't have it last year but we did have one this year, with masks and social
distancing. So it was a great event for all.
And Madam Chair, if you'd like to go through the winners, we have a few on the phone or on the Teams
meeting with us.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, Mr. Stopplecamp. You know, I have to say, it is extraordinary to
go out and see how you maneuver around all those cones. It was really amazing.
And so I'd like to congratulate, for the single axle snowplow, first place, Dave Johnson and John Prather.
And are both of you on the phone? Would you like to share some comments with the Board?
HENRY STOPPLECAMP: Dave is on the Teams meeting. He is on mute at this point.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Mr. Johnson, if you'd like to unmute, we would love to hear from you.
HENRY STOPPLECAMP: Maybe a little technical difficulty.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah, he's-- it should be down at the bottom of your screen, that
microphone. And if you hit that, that will unmute it. There you go.
DAVE JOHNSON: Yes. So I don't know if John's there.
HENRY STOPPLECAMP: He's not [INAUDIBLE], Dave.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: No.
DAVE JOHNSON: OK. Well, this is something that's been going on for a long time. John and I started in
2013. So it's taken us eight years to get to win this national rodeo title. So it takes a while. It's pretty

exciting to go up there and then not only win a first place but third place as well. So this is a first first place
for RTD, which we were hoping to do two years ago for the 50th anniversary. But we only got fifth place
that year. So we were extremely confident this year that we could probably win, and we did. We did. So
hopefully next year, John and I can try for it again, maybe get two first place for RTD.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Great. Thank you.
Our second place winners were Andrew Kames and August Trujillo. Are either of them on the line?
HENRY STOPPLECAMP: I do not believe so.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK. Thank you. And third place was Shane Reposa and Dave Waite. So
congratulations to them.
In the tandem axle snowplow, first place was Leo Dowd and Martha Guzman. Are any of those folks on
the line?
HENRY STOPPLECAMP: Leo is on, and I do not see Martha.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Leo, would you like to share a few words with us, sir?
RON POSEY: Excuse me, Chair. Henry Stopplecamp, this is Ron Posey. Leo is having difficult with his
phone so he can't get through. But he says thank you. He is listening. He says thank you for the
opportunity.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: All right. Thank you so much.
Second place winner was Daniel Guerrero and Chip Seedroff. And third place was Nate Barella and John
Oldham.
The 2021 National Snow Plow Rodeo for the single axle snow plow, the first place went to Dave Johnson
and John Prather. You guys were really rocking it out. So congratulations and thank you for representing
RTD so amazingly.
Third place in the tandem axle snowplow was Dave Johnson and John Prather. And 17th place was Leo
Dowd and Martha Guzman. So congratulations to all of you.
And the other thing I will just say for the record is that the General Manager was out there all day, from
6:00 in the morning. And she actually was driving the snowplow at the end. And Director Catlin, I thought,
was going to be driving, but she tells me she became the film person and filmed it all. So thank you,
everyone who participated in it. And you know, next year, you guys should all come out. It's really an
amazing feat to watch these folks maneuver these huge trucks. So congratulations. Thank you, Mr.
Stopplecamp.
HENRY STOPPLECAMP: Could I add just one last thing?

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Of course.
HENRY STOPPLECAMP: We had 12 teams within RTD. And then on the International, there was over 50
teams competing. And we're competing against the Alaska DOT-- they have snow-- and DIA and their
snow crews, and a lot of the municipalities. And a lot of the teams practice year round for this competition.
And our team, Dave and John put a lot of effort into it over the last few years. And they did, they rocked it.
So I want to thank all our folks that move the snow year round-- not year round, but as needed for RTD.
Thank you very much.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. Thank you very much. And congratulations again to all of the
teams at RTD. They are pretty phenomenal and make us all really proud. So thank you.
OK. This is our public participation period, which is open to anyone who would like to address the Board.
As is our custom, we allow any of our elected officials present to speak first. If you wish to speak. And
have not already done so, please either raise your virtual hand or press star 9 on your phone. Our staff
will unmute you when it's your turn to speak. And if you're dialed in, then press star 6 to toggle your mute
settings.
Please bear in mind that participating in this process, you are being recorded. So if you do not wish to be
recorded, then your comments will have to be submitted in writing and you will not have the opportunity to

those materials to the Board Office at the following email address, board.office@rtd-denver.com.
During this time, the Board will not offer comments or responses. Directors or staff may contact speakers
following comments if they raise matters that lend themselves to follow up. Speakers should begin their
remarks by stating their names, and each speaker will have three minutes to speak. And speakers,
please refrain from profane or obscene speech. Direct your comments to the Board as a whole and
refrain from personal attacks.
Ms. Parish, do we have any speakers in the queue?
TAI-SHRAE PARISH: I do not see any hands raised at this time.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK. And there is no one on the phone.
TAI-SHRAE PARISH: No. Or I'm sorry, hold on. Someone just raised their hands.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK.
TAI-SHRAE PARISH: It is a phone number ending in 9219.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK. Please, state your name. Hello?
KATE WILLIAMS: The [INAUDIBLE] still muted.

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK, go ahead.
TAI-SHRAE PARISH: One second, Chair. I think we're trying to get the permissions allowed for them to
speak.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK. Thank you.
SPEAKER 1: Press star 6 to unmute.
SPEAKER 2: Can you hear me?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes, I can.
SPEAKER 2: Hello. OK. Can I start?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes, please do.
SPEAKER 2: OK, thanks. Hey, I just want to suggest a couple of things, two things first. Happy belated
birthday to the schedule and planner over at Blake. Second thing I want to acknowledge is last week a
few of you who acknowledged priority over privilege, and I appreciate that-- a couple things. I don't know
if some updates or modifications or improvements can be done to the RTD app as far as trying to connect
people a little bit better.
One example. If you are at 18th and California and you're trying to get to DIA, the app will have you get
on the 43 to Central Park and then get on the A Line, instead of having you just get to Union Station to
get on the A Line. That's one thing.
Another thing is, how can we engage the community? With Daylight Savings coming, there are some dark
and unsafe areas, stops that are in the District. One that comes to mind off the top of my head is Martin
Luther King and Colorado Boulevard. So I don't know. I know they're doing some kind of Halloween mask
participation with the community, getting them involved, offering them free trips or bus passes or
whatever. I don't know how that can then roll over into some safety things, because they're out there more
than we are. So I don't know how we can engage them in getting some better lighting in some dark,
unsafe areas.
Another thing is, I'm not sure where we are as far as reimagining, moving forward, whatever. But I don't
know if this is the time to review route structure with routes that overlap and how maybe, as the District,
we can do a better job of feeding trains, having the buses feed trains, instead of what appears to be the
opposite.
Another thing, last on the list, is having an opportunity to humanize operators. I know Comcast, there's a
Comcast Cares Day. But allowing the operators, mechanics, an opportunity to engage with the people
that we interact with every day, whether it's feeding at a homeless shelter, reading at a school, helping
the elderly do yard work, whatever it is. I think that RTD needs to do a better job at humanizing operators
so that they know that we're just not fare Nazis and whatever the case may be.

So that's all I have to say.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: All right. Thank you so much.
SPEAKER 2: Thank you. Ms. Parish, is there anyone else on the queue?
TAI-SHRAE PARISH: No, I do not see anyone else.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: All right. Thank you.
All right. With no other participants in the queue, I will now close the public participation period at this
time. In a moment, the Board of Directors will meet in executive session to receive legal advice in relation
to the American Rescue Plan Act funding requirements. Please note that the Board will reconvene in
open session after the executive session ends. I will now entertain a motion to move into executive
session pursuant to 24-6-402(4)(b) CRS to receive legal advice regarding the American Rescue Plan Act
funding requirements.
KATE WILLIAMS: So moved, Director Williams.
SHELLEY COOK: Second, Director Cook.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: All right. I have a movement of Director Williams and a second of Director
Cook. Are there any nos to go into executive session?
All right. Seeing none, it looks like all 15 Board members are going in for the executive session. So the
time is now 5:51. We are going to ask that everybody get off the line-- or, hold on, we're going to get off
the line and go into another meeting. So upon the conclusion of the executive session, the Board will
reconvene to address the remaining items of the Board meeting agenda. Would all those entitled to
participate in the executive session please move into the other meeting at this time? OK. [INAUDIBLE]

HENRY STOPPLECAMP: Brandy, this is Henry Stopplecamp. Since we don't know how long this is
going, is there a way to notify everybody when it's over with for executive session?
SPEAKER 1: We have a PowerPoint presentation running that we should be hearing here in just a
moment.
HENRY STOPPLECAMP: OK.
SPEAKER 1: I'm trying to work with Jillian on the side here. When it stops, it'll actually be-- that's when
they'll reconvene.
HENRY STOPPLECAMP: OK. So we just watch the screen then.

SPEAKER 1: Yeah, just watch the screen.
HENRY STOPPLECAMP: Thank you.
SPEAKER 1: Thanks.

thank everyone on the line for your patience.
Miss Tai-Shrae, I'm wondering if we should do a roll call, just to make sure we have everybody.
KATE WILLIAMS: Madam Chair, Director Williams. I'm going to suggest that all the Directors check their
mute buttons, as a number of them are unmuted.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, ma'am. OK. Not seeing Miss Tai-Shrae, I'm going to just go
through for roll call quickly. Director Bouquet.

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK, thank you. We are missing Director Broom and Director Sloan. I'll let
you know when they get back on. It is now 6:59 PM and I'm calling the Board meeting to order again.

Next on the agenda is the committee reports. The committee minutes were included in the Board packet.
Are there any corrections from Directors? All right. Hearing none, those committee reports will stand as
submitted and will become part of the permanent record.
General Manager Oversight and Performance Management update. Secretary Buzek, if you would
please, give us an update on the work on the GM Oversight committee.
VINCE BUZEK: Thanks, Madam Chair. Just an update on the timeline for GM/CEO Johnson's one-year
anniversary performance appraisal. By Wednesday, November 10, 2021, GM/CEO Johnson will submit a
self-evaluation to the Board through a digital wizard, which will also serve as our appraisal tool. By Friday,
November 19, 2021 is the deadline for Directors to submit their appraisal scoring and comments through
this wizard. Thursday, December 2, 2021, GMOC Executive session and meeting to discuss the draft
appraisal and proposed 2022 compensation. Tuesday, December 7, 2021 is a Board meeting, Board
Executive Committee meeting, to approve final appraisal and 2022 compensation increase.
All this needs to be done by Friday, December 31, 2021, pursuant to Ms. Johnson's contract. If it is not,
then our performance metrics and measurements will have been deemed to have been [INAUDIBLE].
That's all I have. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK, thank you so much. Please note for the record, I see Director Sloan has
gotten back onto-- or resumed. Welcome, Director Sloan.
Next is the approval of the Board meeting and special Board meeting minutes of August 24. So unless
there's an objection to considering these minutes all at the same time, may I please have a motion to
approve the minutes for the following meetings: the August 24 Board meeting and the August 24 Special
Board meeting? Do I have a movant?
KATE WILLIAMS: So moved, Director Williams.
BOBBY DISHELL: Second, Dishell.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: All right. I have a movant of Director Williams and a second of Director
Dishell. Are there any discussions on this motion?
Hearing none, I will call now for the vote. Is there any no votes to the acceptance of the two meeting
minutes? Hearing none, it passes unanimously with 15, or with 14 votes. I still do not see Director Broom.
OK. The Chair's report. I just wanted to share with you that on June 30, 2021 the Colorado General
Assembly passed Senate Bill 238 on creating the Front Range Passenger Rail District. The purpose of
the District is to research, develop, construct, operate, maintain an interconnected passenger rail system
within the Front Range that is competitive in terms of travel time for comparable trips and other modes of
surface transportation.

RTD has been allotted one advisory non-voting position, and I have appointed General Manager and
CEO Debra A. Johnson to be the RTD representative on that body. It is imperative that the RTD
appointee be someone who's intrinsically involved in transit and I chose our General Manager to take that
role. I'd like to thank the General Manager for agreeing to serve on this Commission.
Next is our General Manager's report. General Manager, the floor is yours.
DEBRA JOHNSON: Well, thank you very much, Madam Chair. Good evening to you, Board members
AND all who are virtually assembled. As introduced, I'm Debra Johnson, General Manager and CEO of
the Regional Transportation District.
As part of my General Manager's report, I will brief you on several topics, noting how each of these topics
aligns with the agency's strategic priorities. For those in attendance who may be unfamiliar with the
strategic priorities, they are community value, which is RTD strives to be a strong community partner,
providing value to customers as well as the broader Denver Metro region while sustaining planet Earth;
customer excellence, RTD strives to consistently deliver high quality customer service; employee
ownership, RTD seeks to attract and retain a highly skilled and engaged workforce; and rounding out with
financial success, RTD takes very seriously the management of all financial resources.
This evening I will share with you the following information. Speaking to community value, I will discuss
internal efforts to implement the Accountability Committee recommendations, as well as meeting with
legislators and local government partners, as well as proposed Colorado Department of Transportation
rules promulgated to address impacts of greenhouse gas emissions in the transit space.
Regarding customer excellence, I will discuss ongoing efforts to facilitate customer accommodations
regarding service to the Adams County Justice Center and the progress of the security model working
group tasked with implementing recommendations from the American Public Transportation Association's
peer review panel.
Related to employee ownership strategic priority, I will touch on COVID-19 impacts and employee
vaccination efforts. I will personally acknowledge the National Snowplow Rodeo winners that were held
recently, as well as our employee appreciation events scheduled for this week.
And lastly, with respect to financial success, I will briefly report on recent departmental meetings to
discuss strategic budget alignment.
So turning to community value, the Accountability Committee convened its final meeting on Monday,
October 11, 2021 to discuss RTD's response to the committee's recommendations which were approved
by this Board on Tuesday August 25, 2021. As you will recall, RTD concurred, or partially concurred, with
nearly all of the committee's recommendations, with the lone exception being the recommendation
regarding the consolidation of discount passes. Existing pass programs and fares will be examined during
the system-wide fare study and equity analysis that is anticipated to be completed by the end of 2022. A
cross functional working group charged with administering the implementation of the remaining

recommendations resumed its recurring meetings last week, and the Board will receive periodic progress
reports on the efforts.
As relates to meetings with legislators and municipal partners, I met with Speaker Alan Garnett, Senator
Majority Leader Steve Fenberg, Senator Faith Winter, and representative Matt Gray to discuss RTD's
finances and current operating environment. I appreciated the opportunity to engage with legislative
leadership and I look forward to our continued productive collaboration as the General Assembly begins a
new session in January.
On September 29, I met with city of Lone Tree Mayor Jackie Millet to discuss development in the
southern suburbs of the District and to tour the new Kiewit regional headquarters located literally a stone's
throw from the Sky Ridge station.
On October 15, I, along with Assistant General Managers Henry Stopplecamp and Bill Van Meter met
with CDOT Executive Director Shoshana Lew and Kathleen Bracke and officials representing Boulder
County and the city of Boulder to visit the Boulder junction station and to discuss short and long range
planning efforts for service to the area.
And just yesterday, I, as well as Assistant General Managers Stopplecamp and Van Meter, as well as
TOD staff met with officials from the city of Westminster, including Mayor Anita Seitz and Acting City
Manager Jody Andrews, to tour the development taking place in the area formerly home to the
Westminster Mall.
In addition to these meetings, I have also been a featured speaker or a presenter on several panels,
including those for the Transportation Research Board's inaugural conference on advancing
transportation equity, Hampton Roads-- Hampton Roads being in Virginia-- their Chamber of Commerce,
the Downtown Denver Partnership, the Metro Mayors Caucus, and the Zero Emission Bus Conference
recently held in downtown Denver, which was attended by participants across the country.
And also in relation to community value, I have submitted comments on behalf of RTD to the
Transportation Commission of Colorado regarding proposed revisions to state rules governing the
statewide transportation planning process and specifically with respect to the reduction of greenhouse
gases. The rule cites the role of public transit as a primary mitigation measure in statewide efforts to
reduce greenhouse gases. And I would note that the Board and the agency have reiterated a commitment
to environmental stewardship through the adoption of the 2021-2026 strategic plan just in August.
The agency can be credited with the reduction of 2.3 million tons of carbon dioxide over the last 10 years
and continues to displace an addition of 210,000 tons of harmless emissions annually. I speak on behalf
of the agency when I say that RTD is a willing partner in efforts to reduce the region's overall carbon
footprint, and I would encourage those who do not use transit currently to consider doing so regularly as
we collectively strive to sustain planet Earth.
Now I will delve into our customer excellence priority. As the Board is aware, I, along with members of the
team, have been working with local officials to reroute service to a bus stop adjacent to the Adams

County Justice Center to allow for better customer access. The city of Brighton is working with Adams
County to establish agreements to build the infrastructure for the bus stop on the south side of Bromley
Lane. Brighton has now finalized construction drawings currently and construction is anticipated to be
completed by the end of the year. This is another example of RTD's flexibility and willingness to work with
our municipal partners to produce positive outcomes for customers.
As it relates to the recommendations from the peer review panel engaged by APTA to assess the agency
security model, the working group convened to review and implement these recommendations has now
reached the halfway mark in establishing a blueprint for creating a community policing model within the
transit police division. The blueprint will align with the strategic objectives as outlined in the 2021-2026
strategic plan and will outline strategies that support the systematic use of partnerships and problemsolving techniques to proactively increase safety, confidence, and engagement for the agency's
customers, employees, and stakeholders.
Each element of the blueprint will include objectives, strategies, and tactics, along with key messages and
performance measures, the project parameters, key deliverables, and business plans to shift the agency's
current policing activities to the community policing model. Implementation of this new model is not going
to be a small task and it will take considerable time and staff resources. It is my hope and belief that these
efforts to shift toward a community policing model will help to bolster the public's confidence in the overall
security of the transit network and to reduce the enforcement burden on the agency transit security
personnel as well as supplementary sworn police officers.
Pertaining to employee ownership, want to speak just about the COVID-19 pandemic impacts and
vaccination efforts. As we all know, the Delta variant continues to account for almost all COVID-19 cases
in Colorado. As of Wednesday, October 20, the seven-day moving average of new infections per 100,000
people across Colorado is 33.74. Despite widespread vaccination efforts, COVID-related hospitalizations
are at their highest point since the end of 2021.
The Denver Post reports that the state health department is preparing for the possibility that statewide
action may be necessary as hospitals continue to fill with COVID-19 patients. Larimer and Boulder
counties have reinstated indoor mask mandates and government entities, including the city and County of
Denver, have instituted some mandates, vaccine mandate for their employees. According to data from
the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, between 66.7% and 87.5% of residents in
the counties RTD serves have received at least one dose, with Weld County having the lowest
vaccination rate and city and County of Broomfield the highest. Approximately 2/3 of RTD employees
have now been vaccinated. Overall in Colorado, 78% of eligible individuals have been immunized with at
least one vaccine dose and 71.8% of people are now fully immunized.
The Federal Food and Drug Administration has now authorized the use of boosters of all three authorized
vaccines, and almost 300,000 individuals in Colorado have received booster shots. For anyone who has
not yet received an initial vaccine dose, it's not too late to do so. Vaccinations are available at Kaiser
Permanente offices, as well as community sites in Denver, including the Health Center at Auraria, located
at 955 Lawrence Way, and the Capitol Heights Pharmacy, located at 1200 Madison Street. Additionally,

most Walgreens stores are offering vaccinations, and RTD continues to partner with health officials to
offer the use of Park-n-Ride facilities to host vaccine clinics, with smaller pop-up clinics being held in
various locations around the District.
As we heard earlier on in the meeting, we had our National Snowplow Rodeo winners. And I would like to
personally acknowledge the winners of the RTD Snowplow Rodeo held in August. As you know, I
attended the rodeo personally and had a wonderful time cheering on the participants in both the single
and tandem axle events. I would also offer my congratulations to the employees who placed in the
National Snowplow Rodeo held in September. Thanks and appreciation to those who have honed their
skills to be able to compete at this high level. And as a California native accustomed to warmer weather in
general, I hope it's later than sooner that we'll all need to rely on their impressive snow removal skills.
I wanted to share that we do have some employee appreciation events that are being held to express I,
as well as the executive leadership's team, appreciation for the work of all RTD stellar employees, who
work tirelessly to make lives better through connections. These events, which began yesterday, Monday,
October 26, to continue through Friday, October 29, are scheduled for each of the operating divisions
covering all shifts, as well as at administrative office locations around the District. Times vary by location
and refreshments will be offered at the beginning of the shift for a given location. Mobile coffee stations
and pastries are being provided. I have had the opportunity to attend a few thus far and thoroughly
enjoyed engaging with our people who move people.
And additionally, as we talk about the aspect of appreciation, I and several members of the executive
leadership team have been fortunate to participate and attend several recent graduation ceremonies for
our commuter rail conductors and light rail and bus operator trainees. These graduates have all gone
through the agency's rigorous and extensive training processes and have proven their skill in operating
transit vehicles. And it's important to me and to our executive leadership to support and share our
appreciation and enthusiasm for these graduates as they begin their journey here at RTD, both literally
and figuratively
Now rounding out with financial success. In September, I convened meetings with our Chief Financial
Officer, Doug MacLeod, and our Chief Administration Officer, Leah Riley, and members of the Finance
and Budget teams, and we were meeting with members of the executive leadership to align departmental
budgets around strategic plan priorities in fiscal year 2022 and to identify essential projects and
expenditures across the agency. This approach breaks down barriers between departments and open
lines of communication to establish smarter budgeting practices and bolster strategic long-term thinking. I
look forward to the Board's budget discussion in November, as we seek to collectively implement the next
phase of the 2021-2026 strategic plan, which will be influenced and supported by data received from the
surveys that are currently underway.
On a final note, I would encourage everyone to view the newly reformatted budget document, which can
be found front and center on the RTD website at rtd-denver.com. This ease of access to important budget
information demonstrate the agency's ongoing commitment to financial transparency.

And I know that was long, but recognizing I didn't give a report in September, I wanted to ensure that you
guys were well versed in what's been happening here with the team and I forging ahead. And so with that,
Madam Chair, and to you, Board members, thank you for your indulgence. That concludes my report and
I thank you very kindly for your attention.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, General Manager. That was quite a report. I want to thank you.
Wow, you've been a little busy.
So any comments from Board members for General Manager on her report? Yes, Director Davidson.
ERIK DAVIDSON: Yeah. Thanks. Just a comment. Just thank you, CEO and General Manager Johnson.
Really love the new format going through the strategic plan. It's really, really helpful. I think it'll be really
great as we start to get metrics behind that and we move forward into next year, it'll be really helpful for
measuring progress. So thank you for that. And I, thankfully Mr. MacLeod is on vacation right now, but I
would just call out and say thanks for the new format to everybody who was involved on the budgetary
document. I think it's a big step forward. I know we had a chance to look at it last week, but it really is nice
and I think helpful in communicating with the community at large. So thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. Second Vice Chair Cook.
SHELLEY COOK: --off mute. I just wanted to elaborate a little bit on Director Davidson's remarks, and
had noted that not only is the budget in that much more readable format at this early stage, we are
making it much easier for the public to access it. It's on our main page. It's something that people can
click on, whereas that wasn't always the case. They had to come down to Blake. Those things alone, I
think go a long way toward helping to achieve that financial transparency and openness that we've been
talking about. So thanks much for that.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. OK, I would just like, for the record, to note that Director Broom
has joined the meeting and so now all 15 Board members are in attendance again.
I'm seeing no one else, so I'd like to go to unanimous consent. There are seven items on the unanimous
consent agenda this evening. They're listed under Item 12, actions A through G. They are the 2022
legislative program, the Longmont transit facility, contract awards for the architectural and engineering
services, strategic plan survey data validation, the January 2022 proposed service changes, the Board
committee structure, and the 2022 through 2027 mid-term financial plan. If anyone has a change to or
questions on one of these items, please feel free to advise the Chair at this time, and we will, of course,
be happy to pull it from unanimous consent agenda for consideration under recommended action.
Seeing none, may I have a motion to approve the consent agenda?
PEGGY CATLIN: So moved.
VINCE BUZEK: Second.

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK. Was that Director Lewis? Oh, Catlin? And-VINCE BUZEK: Secretary Buzek.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. Are there any no votes on this action? Seeing none, I have 15
aye votes, which is all 15 Board members. The motion is passed.
This evening, we have no recommended actions. So with that, I will just move to any old business to
come before the Board. Is there any old business? OK, seeing none, any new business?
All right, ladies and gentlemen, seeing no other matters before us in the Board meeting, I will now
entertain a motion to adjourn the Board meeting.
BOB BROOM: So moved.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK. Director Catlin, I'm sorry.
BOB BROOM: Director Broom.
PEGGY CATLIN: I apologize. I did not get my hand up in time. But I suppose this is old business. And
during the Financial, Administration, and Audit Committee meeting, I was going to give an update on our
activities for the internal audit process. And if I might take a minute to do that?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes.
PEGGY CATLIN: OK. So in August, we engaged the firm of Reuben Brown LLC to assess and provide
recommendations based on the performance audit completed by the Colorado Office of the State Auditor
and the subsequent peer review conducted by the APTA Association. The Reuben Brown team
specializes in internal audit function implementations which follow the Institute of Internal Auditors, IIA.
The scope of work for this engagement consists of eight tasks. These are: the initial discovery,
recommendation of an optimal internal audit department structure for RTD, recommendation of an Audit
Committee structure based on industry and IIA best practices, provide examples of best practice internal
audit charters, complete an enterprise risk assessment of RTD and implement procedures for an ongoing
enterprise risk management process, perform a peer comparison to gather transit agency best practices,
recommend procedures and software for recordkeeping and reporting, and assist with RTD internal audit
resource selection.
So those are the eight tasks that are included in Reuben Brown's scope of work. The timeline for
completion is the end of this year. And Reuben Brown will provide a report summarizing results of each of
these eight tasks. For the most part, all tasks are on track for completion, although I've been told that
there's been a slight delay on the risk assessment piece due to just external contacts that are required.
But overall, the contract is approximately 70% complete.

So I just wanted to give that report, that we're on track, that I'm excited to see the results, and that we
should be hearing some news toward the end of the year or very shortly thereafter. Thank you, Madam
Chair.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, Director Catlin. OK. There was-- yes, General Manager.
DEBRA JOHNSON: I was just going to say, just as a follow-on to the report that Director Catlin broached,
want everybody to know that the risk assessment is underway, recognizing that a week has elapsed, so
we're back on track. So I just wanted to add that. Thank you very much.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: All right. Thank you so much. OK. I'm not seeing anyone else. So there was
no new business. So seeing no other matters coming before this Board meeting, I will now entertain a
motion to adjourn.
SHONTEL LEWIS: So moved, Director Lewis.
KATE WILLIAMS: Second, Director Williams.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I have a movant of Director Lewis and a second of Director Williams. Are
there any no votes? Seeing none, we are adjourned as of 7:23 PM. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
Good night.
