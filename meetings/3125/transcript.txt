PEGGY CATLIN: John McKay, are you the one ending in 5-8?
JOHN MCKAY: I'm sorry, I missed that. The Teams was speaking when you said that.
PEGGY CATLIN: Yeah, you are. Your number was highlighted.
So as far as committee members go, we currently have Director Walker, Director Cook, and
myself, and alternate Director Buzek. So we do not yet have a quorum. Oh, now we have
Director Walker-- let's see, Walker, Cook, and myself. So we need to wait a few minutes to see if
we can get a quorum.
VINCE BUZEK: Don't I become a member for purposes of determining a quorum if you don't
have enough people?
PEGGY CATLIN: I'm happy with that. I like that solution.
KATE WILLIAMS: How many do you need for a quorum, Peggy?
PEGGY CATLIN: I believe we need four.
KATE WILLIAMS: Well, Vince probably can hold his own.
PEGGY CATLIN: Yes.
TROY WHITMORE: Ah, I don't know about that.
VINCE BUZEK: My own what?
KATE WILLIAMS: There you are, Troy. Just a heads up, Troy has to leave and I have to leave.
I'm leaving first and then Troy's running after me. So I'm just letting you guys all know that.
PEGGY CATLIN: OK. Who on the call has a number that ends in 9-5?
ROGER SHERMAN: That's Roger Sherman, calling to listen in.
PEGGY CATLIN: Roger.
KATE WILLIAMS: Oh, you sneak, you.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Looks like we have Director Cook on the line. So we do have the
four, with Director Buzek as the alternate.
PEGGY CATLIN: OK. So it's 1:02 on September 24, 2020. I'd like to call the GM Executive
Search/GMOC Committee meeting to order. With us on this meeting, we have Directors Buzek,

Director Williams, Director Cook, Director Tisdale, Director Walker, and Director Whitmore.
Perhaps they have moved into executive session already. We are missing, from the committee,
we're missing Directors Menten and Director Lewis and Director Guissinger.
Also joining us just now is Director Mihalik. And we have Paul Ballard, Gregg Moser, Barbara
McManus, and by phone, John McKay. Did I miss-- and Melanie Snyder, excuse me. Did I miss
anyone?
OK. I'd like to entertain a motion-- and this needs to be by committee members-- I'd like to
entertain a motion to move into executive session pursuant to 24-6-402(4)(f)(l) Colorado Revised
Statute for consideration of personnel matters regarding recently selected General Manager/
Chief Executive Officer candidate Debra Johnson, 24-6-402(4)(e)(l) Colorado Revised Statute
for determining positions relative to matters that may be subject to negotiations, developing
strategy for negotiations, and instructing negotiators regarding new General Manager/ Chief
Executive Officer compensation and contract, and 24-6-402(4)(b) Colorado Revised Statute to
receive legal advice regarding the same.
Do I hear a motion?
Do I hear a motion?
JEFF WALKER: So moved.
PEGGY CATLIN: Director Walker, and second with Director Buzek. OK.
And so just a reminder, we will need to exit this meeting, enter into the executive session, and
then rejoin this meeting when we are finished with the executive session. So I'll see you all in the
other room.
[AUDIO OUT]
--the GM Executive Search GMOC Committee meeting on September 24, 2020. It is currently-if I could get my watch to work-- 1:08 PM. And we need to have a do over here.
On the call we have committee members Vince Buzek, Director Cook, Director Walker, and
myself for a quorum. Also, we have Directors Whitmore and Mihalik. And on the phone we have
Director-- or we have John McKay. And please, for the record, whose phone ends in 72?
Could the person on the phone with a number ending in 72 please identify yourself for our
record?
[COMPUTER TONE]
There's someone on the line whose phone number ends in 72.
KEN MIHALIK: I believe that's Nate Minor.

PEGGY CATLIN: Is that you, Nate? Nate, if you could unmute your phone, that would be nice.
BARBARA MCMANUS: He might be just recording and not actually present.
PEGGY CATLIN: OK. Well, OK, thank you for stating that for the record.
All right. So again, we have Directors Buzek, Mihalik, Cook, Walker, and Whitmore on the line.
And then also joining we have Barbara McManus, John McKay, and apparently Nate Minor, and
Melanie Snyder.
Now I'd like to entertain a motion to go into executive session pursuant to 24-6-402(4)(f)(I)
Colorado Revised Statute for consideration of personnel matters-- that was Roman numeral one-personnel matters regarding recently selected General Manager/ Chief Executive Officer
candidate Debra Johnson, 24-6-402(4)(e)(I) Colorado Revised Statute for determining positions
relative to matters that may be subject to negotiations, developing strategy for negotiations, and
instructing negotiators regarding New General Manager/ Chief Executive Officer compensation
and contract, and 24-6-402(4)(b) Colorado Revised Statute to receive legal advice regarding the
same.
Do I have a motion?
JEFF WALKER: So moved, Walker.
PEGGY CATLIN: Director Walker.
VINCE BUZEK: Second.
PEGGY CATLIN: Second-VINCE BUZEK: Second, Buzek.
PEGGY CATLIN: OK. All in favor?
IN UNISON: Aye.
PEGGY CATLIN: And I'm an aye as well. Director Cook, are you an aye?
SHELLEY COOK: Yes.
PEGGY CATLIN: OK. So now we will exit this executive session at 1:11-- or we will exit this
general session at 1:11 and reconvene once we are out of executive session. So if you leave this
meeting and enter the other one, we will convene in a sec.
[AUDIO OUT]

And we are reconvening the General Manager Executive Search/GMOC Committee meeting on
September 24, 2020 at 2:00. On the call we have Director Buzek, Director Mihalik, Director
Menten, Director Tisdale, Director Walker, Director Whitmore. I think we're waiting for a few
others to join on the committee.
We have-- again, who, is it Nate Minor, is that you on phone number ending in 72?
NATE MINOR: That's me.
PEGGY CATLIN: OK. We have John McKay, 5-8, and we have Director Lewis on 8-4. And
who is, is Jon Murray, the Denver Post on 3-5?
JON MURRAY: That's true.
PEGGY CATLIN: OK. I'm starting to learn all these now that we're close to the end of this
game.
Let's see. Director Cook has since joined. Our Chair Rivera-Malpiede is not on yet.
And then we also have Paul Ballard, Gregg Moser, John McKay, Barbara McManus, and those I
cited on-- and Melanie Snyder, as well as those I cited on the phone. We will be waiting a few
more minutes for our other committee members to join.
Did I mention Director Lewis earlier? Or did you just now join, Director Lewis?
GREGG MOSER: Director Catlin, the Chair is in the other executive session still and she said
she didn't have the link. So could John sent her the link again for this open session so she can
join, please?
PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you. And yes, Director Lewis, thank you. I see that you have joined.
Gregg, did you have something else to add?
GREGG MOSER: No, thank you. If John can-- I see she's still stuck in there. I switched over to
let her know we were here and she said she didn't have the link. So when John sends it, I'm sure
she'll come over and join.
PEGGY CATLIN: OK.
[COMPUTER TONE]
So bear with us while we wait for others to join.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
BARBARA MCMANUS: Director Lewis-- Director Lubow will not be joining us for the rest of
the session.

PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you, Barbara. Gregg, your hand is still raised. Did you have-GREGG MOSER: No. Thank you. Sorry about that.
PEGGY CATLIN: OK. So again, we have-- pardon me-- we're still waiting for the Chair.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I'm on, First Chair Catlin.
PEGGY CATLIN: OK. You didn't show up on my list. So I guess-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I had to call in. Yeah, I had to call in. I'm sorry.
PEGGY CATLIN: And what phone number is yours then?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: 2199.
PEGGY CATLIN: Oh, it's not showing up. But OK.
All right. So for the record, we have committee members Menten, Cook, Lewis, Walker, myself,
and Director Buzek as an alternate. So we do have a quorum. Also on the call are Directors
Mihalik, Director Tisdale, and Director Whitmore. And then joining us as well is Gregg Moser,
Melanie Snyder, and Barbara McManus, and John McKay. Did I get everyone?
OK. We have a recommended action this afternoon, which is the appointment of CEO/GM and
approval of the contract. And I'd like to read the recommended action to you.
Approval of Chief Executive Officer and General Manager employment agreement with Debra
A. Johnson. The General Manager Executive Search Oversight and Performance Management
Committee paren, committee presents to the Board a motion to adopt the attached resolution
number, blank, series of 2020 thereby approving the terms of the executive employment
agreement with Debra A. Johnson. Do I have a motion?
JEFF WALKER: So moved.
SHELLEY COOK: Second.
PEGGY CATLIN: OK. I heard Director Walker move and Director Cook second. Was there
discussion? Director Menten.
NATALIE MENTEN: And so this is approval? Can you read that again? Because it sounded
approval of the resolution and approval of the contract. Will you restate that, please.
PEGGY CATLIN: I'm just reading the recommended action, which is to forward this to the full
board for consideration. It's approval of Chief Executive Officer and General Manager
employment agreement with Debra A. Johnson.

NATALIE MENTEN: OK. Thank you.
PEGGY CATLIN: Is there any discussion? Director Cook.
SHELLEY COOK: Yeah, sorry, I actually lost my connection and then had to dial back in there,
right after I seconded the motion. Could you read it entirely again, please?
PEGGY CATLIN: OK. This will be the recommended action on Tuesday. But what we are
voting on today is to forward a recommendation to the full Board for consideration on Tuesday.
And it's the General Manager Executive Search, Oversight, and Performance Management
Committee paren, committee, presents to the Board a motion to adopt the attached resolution
number, to be determined, series of 2020, thereby approving the terms of the executive
employment agreement with Debra A. Johnson.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Thank you much.
PEGGY CATLIN: OK. Did that answer your question?
SHELLEY COOK: It did. Thank you very much. And of course, as the seconder, I'll be
supporting the motion. Thank you.
PEGGY CATLIN: OK. your digital hand is still up.
Director Menten, did you have additional comments?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: No.
LYNN GUISSINGER: And I think about, cause I was always in the car. We lived in the country.
PEGGY CATLIN: I believe we have Director Guissinger on the phone? Was that who I was
hearing?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: It's Chair Rivera- Malpiede. I was able to get on.
PEGGY CATLIN: OK, I'm sorry. All right. I'd like to take a-- to poll the directors to whether or
not you approve the employment agreement with Debra Johnson. Director Menten.
MELANIE SNYDER: The motion-- Madam Chair, pardon me. So the motion is, I think the
language of the motion should speak for itself that you previously read, which was that the Board
is adopting a motion to adopt the attached resolution.
PEGGY CATLIN: Right. OK. Do we need to restate it?
MELANIE SNYDER: I think you've stated it twice. It's clear for the record.

PEGGY CATLIN: OK. I didn't want to get tongue tied again.
OK. Director Buzek.
VINCE BUZEK: Yes.
PEGGY CATLIN: OK. Director Menten.
NATALIE MENTEN: One question I want to ask. First, will we have an opportunity under
Other Matters to make a comment? Would that be at the end of this agenda?
PEGGY CATLIN: Melanie.
MELANIE SNYDER: Sorry. Pardon me. So your question was Other Matters at which meeting?
Or just now? Oh, for this meeting, yes, you can make a comment, yes, during this meeting.
NATALIE MENTEN: OK. So I'll just leave it with my vote, which is no.
PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you, Director Menten. Director Cook.
SHELLEY COOK: Yes.
PEGGY CATLIN: Director Walker.
JEFF WALKER: Yes.
PEGGY CATLIN: Chair Rivera-Malpiede.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes.
PEGGY CATLIN: And I am a yes. So the mot-- oh, Director Lewis, I apologize. Director Lewis,
are you still there? We'll give Director Lewis a minute to unmute.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Director Guissinger is trying to call in right now as well.
PEGGY CATLIN: OK. So Director Lewis is not showing up on my list of attendees. I wonder if
she dropped off the call. Could John McKay try and get in touch with Director Lewis?
BARBARA MCMANUS: I just texted Director Lewis to see if she would be rejoining the
meeting.
PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you, Ms. McManus. This is the longest committee vote in history, I
think.
JOHN MCKAY: Director Lewis is having some computer issues.

PEGGY CATLIN: Pardon me. What did you say?
JOHN MCKAY: Director Lewis is having some computer issues. She's trying to get back in.
PEGGY CATLIN: OK, thank you.
BARBARA MCMANUS: And Director Guissinger says she's waiting to be let into the meeting.
I'm not sure what that means.
John resent the link to Director Lewis, but it sounds like it's hardware or internet problem she's
having with her computer rebooting itself.
PEGGY CATLIN: And I don't know about Director Guissinger.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Ms. McManus, perhaps Shontel could call in instead.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yeah. John sent her the credentials. So she has that in front of her, if
that's what she chooses.
PEGGY CATLIN: And could Director Guissinger do the same?
BARBARA MCMANUS: I don't know. I'm going to try to call Director Guissinger and so she
can be on my phone.
PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you. My apologies to all of you on the phone.
I would like to record our committee members' votes for the record. But as it stands now, we do
have-- we have [AUDIO OUT].
BARBARA MCMANUS: I have Director Guissinger.
PEGGY CATLIN: OK, thank you.
Director Guissinger, would you like me to read the motion for you?
LYNN GUISSINGER: Is the motion to approve the contract with Debra? Yeah, sure, it's not
long. Just go ahead and read it to me. Do it.
SHELLEY COOK: It's to present to the full Board, correct?
PEGGY CATLIN: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: Thank you.
PEGGY CATLIN: It's for this committee to forward to the full Board the recommendation to
approve the contract with Debra Johnson.

LYNN GUISSINGER: Yeah, in case I lose you, I'm just going to say yes. I do vote for that.
PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you, Director Guissinger.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Is that all you need?
PEGGY CATLIN: That's all we need. Have a nice trip.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Thank you so much.
PEGGY CATLIN: We're still waiting for Director Lewis? I wanted to make sure we captured her
vote for the record.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Let me try and get a hold of her.
For those of you not on the committee, thank you all for your input and your time. Trying to fill
the space here while we're waiting.
VINCE BUZEK: I think Director Tisdale has some stories he could tell us. Stories from the sea.
BARBARA MCMANUS: I think we all have stories. We just don't tell them quite as well as
Director Tisdale.
PEGGY CATLIN: Director Lewis, welcome. We are taking the vote. And I don't know if you
were able to hear the resolution or hear the recommended action.
SHONTEL LEWIS: I didn't, I'm sorry.
PEGGY CATLIN: You did not? The recommend action is approval of the Chief Executive
Officer and General Manager employment agreement with Debra A. Johnson for this committee
to forward to Board, the whole Board of Directors for consideration.
So would your vote be to approve this employment agreement or not?
SHONTEL LEWIS: The vote is to approve the employment agreement to take it to the full
committee?
PEGGY CATLIN: Yes.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Or to the full Board, I'm sorry.
PEGGY CATLIN: Yes.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Yes, I am comfortable with taking this to the full Board.

PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you. So I'm glad that you were able to log on so that we captured your
vote.
So for the record, we have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven yeses. And we have one no, the
no being Director Menten. Thank you all.
Now we can move on to Other Matters. Do any directors, committee or not, committee have
other matters? Director Menten?
NATALIE MENTEN: Yes, thank you. So I have fought for government transparency for many,
many, many years. And this touches well before I was an elected official. And I'm extremely
disappointed that we are not releasing, as a committee, major contract components to allow for
public comment. And that means putting it out with our agenda days before we vote on it.
And I believe we have done all of our major negotiations all that's left is a couple typos. And one
Board member, I just share this for the public record, again, I take transparency very, very
seriously. It should be a fundamental goal of government. But I was reminded by one of the
participants in the executive session that we just came out of that I could be punished under
Robert's Rules of Order if I was to share details of what went on in the closed door meeting.
Now I don't recall that I swore my oath by laying my hand on Robert's Rules of Order. And I
don't know what I may do going forward from this meeting. Because I think I've shared how I
feel about transparency. And there is a trend, it should really be stopped, at RTD in treating the
General Manager's contract and hiding it behind a closed door and using excuses so that we don't
get public feedback. It's just unacceptable.
I would love to see what the punishment is. Please bring it on. What can you do? Nothing. I don't
know what I will do. But you know, as I've only got three months left on this Board, I've dealt
with this before. I dealt with it in 2015 when we did it with Dave Genova. The same thing. Here,
Board of Directors sign an NDA. And then by the way, you're not allowed to talk about this at all
ever, till we vote on it. It's just, this is not good public policy. This is the prime example of bad
public policy.
In three months, I will be off this Board. I hope to God somebody gets elected to further-- there
are some Board members, I do believe, that have strong feelings towards transparency.
Unfortunately, we're outnumbered. And I hope in this new election there are some more strong
transparency advocates that get elected to this, one of the largest government agencies in
Colorado. That's it. Done. Thank you.
PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you, Director Menten. It looks like we have-- I can't tell who they are.
Somebody-- Director Rivera-Malpiede is that-- yes, you have your hands up. Chair RiveraMalpiede.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes. I'd like to have our counsel speak first, please.
PEGGY CATLIN: Melanie, can you respond?

MELANIE SNYDER: I'm happy to respond to any specific question. I think that-- and I don't
want to speak for the Directors, I'll let them do that themselves. But I would certainly
acknowledge that it is a core goal of this organization, transparency and abiding by all of our
laws, including our open meetings and open records laws. And we have followed that process.
And I'll leave it at that, unless Director, or Chair, Madam Chair, you had another specific
question you'd like for me to address.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: General Counsel, I thought I had seen your hand raised. That's
why I asked.
MELANIE SNYDER: Oh. I don't think so.
PEGGY CATLIN: Somebody's hand was raised, but I'm not sure who it was.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: It may have been Director Lewis, for a moment.
PEGGY CATLIN: OK. I see Director Cook's hand is raised. So Chair Rivera-Malpiede, go
ahead-SHONTEL LEWIS: It was Director Lewis. My hand was raised.
PEGGY CATLIN: Oh, was it? OK. I'll let Director, or Chair Rivera-Malpiede continue, and then
Director, that you still want to speak, that would be fine.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Madam Chair, if I might be able to go last.
PEGGY CATLIN: OK. Director Lewis?
SHONTEL LEWIS: I apologize. I'm having issues with my laptop this afternoon, or morning-no, afternoon. And so I just wanted to state for the record that I do support this contract going
before the Board. And I appreciate that we will do that and have our colleagues respond to that.
I, like Director Menten, actually have had some concerns about how public has been engaged in
this process. And while I have those concerns, I do support this going to the full Board. And
unfortunately, we didn't have the opportunity to have the public weigh in or have access to
preview the contract beforehand, and such is life. But I did want to say that on the record.
PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you, Director Lewis. Director Cook.
SHELLEY COOK: Yeah, thank you. Just briefly to respond. I generally agree that the
transparency is in other things being equal, that's where we want to go. This is such a particular
and special circumstance. We have been saying that the negotiation continues until the final vote.
And I firmly believe that. In fact, one time I even wrote a paper called "Negotiations at the Dais,"
kind of taking apart how those things happen in real time as a motion is made and considered.

So I just wanted to respond to Director Menten's points and urge that she adhere to the principle
that we have of maintaining confidentiality while that's being negotiated. And truthfully, we
cannot any of us say that the terms are settled until we get to that vote. Thank you very much.
PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you, Director Cook. We have directors Tisdale and Walker.
DOUG TISDALE: Did you want to choose one of us to proceed?
PEGGY CATLIN: Well, I said Director Tisdale first. So unless you rehearsed a duet, I don't
know.
DOUG TISDALE: No, I don't think there are any rehearsed comments in any of this discussion
today. Thank you, Madam Chair.
I want to note first that silence by any Director does not betoken consent to any comments made
by any other Director. And I think it would be unfortunate if people were to read it that way.
Secondly, transparency is, in fact, a core goal of this agency. And I submit that it has been
achieved in all respects as applicable to a representative body operating under the law, its own
laws, its own internal laws, as well as the laws of external sources, such as statutory law of
Colorado.
We have at all times, in all respects operated transparently and continue to do so. And that
discussion, I think needs to be had on the record so that people understand that what we have
done is absolutely, completely in accord with the laws of our own agency as well as the laws of
the state of Colorado, and that any implication to the contrary, I submit, is unfounded.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you, Director Tisdale. Director Walker.
JEFF WALKER: Thanks. I think my hand is down now.
So kind of along those lines, it's not just transparency, but there's trust involved also. And those
applicants, all of the applicants, everybody who put in an application to this agency for this
position trusted that we would hold that information confidential until we got to the appropriate
time. So we can be open with everything, but that doesn't necessarily garner us trust. If we can't
be trusted to negotiate and hold this information until it's appropriate to release it, then we've got
nothing. Our name is mud. And it would be tough to find somebody to do business with us at a
reasonable cost.
I've been a consultant. I know how that game is played. You have an unreliable potential client,
you charge more for it. You've got a client that pays the bills on time, holds proprietary
information as secret or as confidential, well, the bill is reflected, the invoices reflect that, or the
negotiated contract reflects that. I trust you. So if we don't have that trust, we don't have
anything.

We adhere to the law. We're trustworthy. If, like I mentioned before, if anybody, if both parties
were to agree to any other conditions, then that's fine for any information to be released. That's
fine. But absent that, we both have to adhere to what we've agreed to. And so far, that's holding
this information confidential until we have all of the terms ironed out. The only way that I know
that we can do that is to vote on it.
So that's my position. Thanks.
PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you, Director Walker. I know Chair Rivera-Malpiede had asked that
she go last. Are there any other Directors on the committee or not who would like to speak?
Before I turn it over to you, Chair Rivera-Malpiede, I just wanted to comment that I have been
relying very heavily on the legal advice from our General Counsel, Melanie Snyder. And I feel
that we have, as Director Tisdale stated, followed the law. So I'm comfortable with not releasing
the information until we take a vote on Tuesday evening.
Chair Rivera-Malpiede, please.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. Thank you, Chair Catlin.
Let me first start by thanking this entire committee for the hours and hours and hours of work
that have gone into this process. I just want to echo the comments of other Board members. What
we are talking about right now is really a negotiation, which means you can never assume that it
is perfect and that until it is signed by both parties, that's the first thing.
Secondarily, we did make a commitment to keep everything about this until that negotiation was
completed and signed to be confidential. And we do have very, very sacred pieces on the table
right now, trust and confidentiality. If we can't hold to that, you know, we are only as good as
our word. And I, for one, do not want to release anything until Ms. Johnson reviews it, agrees to
it, signs it, along with this Board of Directors. That's our job. And that's our commitment to each
other. And as we move forward this agency through very, very difficult times in a very fluid
environment, I think we owe that to each other to make sure that we're serving the community
with the utmost transparency and trust and the ability to look anyone in the eye and say we did
our due diligence and here's what we have to move forward together for the success of this
region. Thank you.
PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you, Chair Rivera-Malpiede. Are there any other matters to come
before this committee?
Chair Rivera-Malpiede, I think your hand is still raised at this point. It's still. It's still-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Oh, I thought I put it down. There.
PEGGY CATLIN: There we go. We have not set a next meeting date for the second role of this
committee, which is the General Manager Oversight. But that will be determined at a later date
after Tuesday. But this committee's work is not done. So hang in there with us.

I'd like to entertain a motion to adjourn.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: So moved, Rivera-Malpiede.
PEGGY CATLIN: Second?
JEFF WALKER: Second, Walker.
PEGGY CATLIN: OK. Any objection from committee members?
OK. So at 2:32 PM, I call this meeting adjourned. Thank you all.
