ERIK DAVIDSON: And this is Chair Davidson speaking. I am here. That is all 15 members of the Board
present. Zero absent. We have a quorum. Please note that the special Board meeting does not have a
section for public comment this evening. However, the public is invited to still offer comments by email or
by participating remotely in the regularly scheduled November Committee meetings and in person, by
email, or by participating remotely during the December 3 Board meeting.
Move to our first and only portion of the agenda here. This is the executive session. In a moment, the
Board will meet in executive session to receive legal advice and to discuss positions relative to matters
that may be subject to negotiations regarding a potential amendment to the General Manager and Chief
Executive Officer employment agreement.
I would like to append this motion to move into executive session to state that the special Board meeting
will be deemed adjourned after it adjourns into the executive session. For public transparency, this means
that once the Board moves into executive session, the main meeting will be adjourned.
I will now entertain a moment to move into executive session to discuss the following. Executive session
pursuant to Section 24-6-402(4)(b) CRS to receive legal advice and Section 24-6-402(4)(e) CRS for
determining positions relative to matters that may be subject to negotiations regarding a potential
amendment to the GM CEO's employment agreement.
DOUG TISDALE: So moved.
ERIK DAVIDSON: Do I have a motion?
DOUG TISDALE: Tisdale.
ERIK DAVIDSON: Tisdale is the movant. A second?
TROY L. WHITMORE: Second.
ERIK DAVIDSON: I have second as Whitmore. Thank you. Are there any opposed? Seeing none, that will
pass with 15 yes votes. At this time, we'll just ask all Directors to please move over to the other executive
session. And we'll link and we'll remind the public that this meeting is now adjourned as of 5:35. See you
all in a moment at our executive session. Thank you.
