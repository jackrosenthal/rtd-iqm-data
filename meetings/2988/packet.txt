April Report

In response to the public health crisis COVID-19 on Saturday March 14th, the Colorado General
Assembly passed HJR20-1007 which suspended the legislative session until 10am on Monday,
March 30, 2020. A second resolution was also passed asking the Colorado Supreme Court to
determine if the state constitution requires the 120 days of the session to be counted
consecutively or if the clock can be suspended during a pause in the legislative schedule. BBMK
expects an answer from the Supreme Court early next week on this question. Prioritization of be
the remaining 350 bills that have yet to move through the legislative process will be determined
by leadership which has indicated that bills with significant fiscal notes will be unlikely to pass.
The only requirement of the Colorado General Assembly is to pass a balanced budget and the
school finance act by June 30th.
The Legislature will reconvene on Monday simply to extend the suspension of the legislative
session. We anticipate the extension of this suspension to a date no earlier than mid-April.
Likewise, the Joint Budget Committee postponed its original date to reconvene on March 23rd to
no sooner than April 7th. This date is likely to be pushed out even further.
Prior to the closure of the Capitol, BBMK met with Senator Lee to discuss the ADA and Title VI
provisions in SB20-151, Administration of the RTD Regional Transportation District. The
meeting was very productive and supplemental materials were provided to the Senator.
Bills of Interest
HB19-1138 Public Real Property Index sponsored by Reps. Coleman and Larson and Senator
Bridges and Gardner. The bill requires all municipalities, in addition to all political subdivisions
of the state, to report “usable real property” owned or under their control to the State Architects
office annually. BBMK was successful in adding an amendment to the legislation to address
the District’s concerns. The bill passed is waiting to be scheduled in the House Appropriations
Committee.
HB20-1151 Expand Authority for Regional Transportation Improvements sponsored by
Rep. Gray and Senator Winter. This bill allows a Transportation Planning Organization to act as
and retain the powers of a Regional Transportation Authority, allowing it to impose charges, fees
and, with voter approval, taxes to generate transportation funding. The bill passed the
Transportation and Energy Committee with the following amendments: L002 makes it clear
that a county or city within TPO may opt out of being part of the financing mechanisms,

L003 clarifies that a regional transportation funding system that is working will not be
interfered with/superseded and L004 which adds language that states when these projects
move forward, environmental statutes should be taken into consideration.

SB20-065 Limit Mobile Electronic Devices by Driving sponsored by Rep. Roberts and Senator
Hansen. The bill would limit the use of a mobile electronic device while driving to adult drivers
who use the mobile electronic device through a hands-free accessory. The bill establishes
penalties of $50 and 2 points for a first violation, $100 and 2 points for a second violation, $200
and 4 points for a third or subsequent violation and $300 and 4 points if the violation involves
text messaging. The bill is waiting to be scheduled for a hearing in the House Transportation
and Energy Committee. BBMK was successful in amending the bill to address the District’s
concerns.
SB20-061 Yield to Bicycles in Bicycle Lanes sponsored by Senator Foote. The bill creates a
new traffic offense for failing to yield to a bicycle in a bicycle lane. The offense is a class A
traffic offense unless it is the proximate cause of a crash or if it causes bodily injury, then it is
careless driving and is punished under the careless driving offense. The bill passed both
chambers.

Third COVID Relief Bill Enacted
Bill Includes Significant Transit Funding, as RTD Requested
Among the supplemental appropriations included in the third COVID relief bill (the CARES Act)
passed by Congress this week is $25 billion in transit formula funds “to prevent, prepare for and
respond to coronavirus.” The President signed the bill on March 27. Transit funds must be
apportioned within seven days of enactment of the legislation, so transit agencies can expect to have
these funds – totaling what would normally be about two-and-a-half years’ of apportionments – very
soon. The funds can be used for capital or operating expenses and carry a 100 percent Federal cost
share, so no State or local match is needed.
On March 20, RTD’s CEO and Board Chair wrote to the entire Congressional delegation requesting
emergency supplemental funding for transit in the CARES Act. They outlined the dramatic declines
in ridership and revenues resulting from social distancing and work-from-home mandates put in
place to control coronavirus. They also emphasized RTD’s commitment to continuing essential bus
and rail service to support access to health care facilities across the region.
Fourth COVID Relief Bill Already Under Discussion: Possible Vehicle for RRIF CRP Fix
Speaker Pelosi has been one of the leading voices in Congress calling for a fourth COVID relief bill
– one focused more on providing economic stimulus than direct assistance to health care,
transportation, municipalities, and other sectors most directly impacted by the virus and the public
health measures needed to address it. No formal action would be taken on the fourth bill until
Congress returns from its three-week recess on April 20.
One area to be addressed in the proposed COVID 4 legislation would be infrastructure. Unknown
at this time is how comprehensive the infrastructure provisions will be, for example, whether an
extension or a full reauthorization of the FAST Act could be included.
SPB has been in close communication with RTD’s Congressional delegation on the possibility of
advancing our RRIF CRP fix – the return of the $28.9 million CRP paid for the DUS project – on

the COVID 4 bill. We are heartened by the initial positive response we have received. We will
continue working with Congressional staff as they develop COVID 4 legislation.

FTA has taken several administrative actions to provide much-needed flexibility to transit agencies
working to maintain essential service during the coronavirus pandemic. On March 13, the FTA
announced that it will permit transit grantees to use their urban and rural formula funds for
COVID-related capital and operating expenses at an 80 percent Federal share. In the absence of
such emergency declaration, there are strict limits on using urban area formula funds for operating
expenses.
On March 26, US DOT Secretary Chao and FTA Administrator Jane Williams announced that the
Department was extending the deadlines for all its pending Notices of Funding Opportunity
(NOFO) for 30 days; this includes the pending NOFO for Buses and Bus Facilities funding, which
was due on March 30.

Exercise First Contract Option Year for
Triunity-Hill Joint Venture Contract for
FasTracks Construction Management Support
Consultant Services

General

Board Meeting Date: April 7, 2020

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the Interim General Manager to approve a contract amendment to exercise the
first option year of the Triunity-Hill Joint Venture for Construction Management Support Consultant
Services (CMSC) for FasTracks, extending the contract end date to July 13, 2021, with no increase
in the contract not-to-exceed amount. Funding for the remainder of this contract is included in the
2020 Adopted Budget in the specific projects where CMSC support would be utilized.
This action addresses the following General Manager’s Goals:
Task Goal #5: Increase Ridership.
BACKGROUND
In April 2014, the RTD Board approved selection and award of a multi-year contract to the Triunity-Hill
Joint Venture for an amount not to exceed $15,150,000 for Construction Management Support
Consultant Services. Notice to Proceed was issued on July 15, 2014, for a six-year contract with four
one-year options. In May 2017, the Board authorized an increase the total contract not-to-exceed value,
bringing the not-to-exceed amount of the contract to $34,400,000.
As of March 23, 2020, RTD has contracted for a total of $$31,056,716 in services to be delivered
through the current contract end date of July 13, 2020, with $283,933 of change orders pending
approval, and $3,059,351 remaining of the contract not-to-exceed value. As of the January 2020
invoice, RTD has paid out a total of $28,335,846 on this contract.
The Triunity-Hill JV includes a certified DBE as 51% managing partner. RTD has set a DBE goal of 27%
for this contract. As of march 23, 2020, actual DBE participation has been 43.7% of the contract
value.
DISCUSSION
RTD has reached the stage of the FasTracks program where all of the ongoing corridor projects are in
the closeout phase, or will be entering closeout within the next few months. At this time, it is crucial to
retain the institutional knowledge needed to close out all contracts and meet final reporting requirements
for FTA grant projects. The proposed time extension to the CMSC contract would make the resources
available to RTD to complete the project closeout in a timely and cost-effective manner.

Packet Pg. 25

2.B.1

In addition, as part of the contract closeout process, RTD faces claims and lawsuits related to its
projects. Support from the CMSC staff that were involved in the original issue could be critical to
resolving the issues in a manner that would be most favorable to RTD.
RTD envisions the CMSC providing continuing support in those areas through July 2021:









Support for North Metro project completion, operations standup, and closeout
Closeout support for the Southeast Rail Extension and Eagle projects
Completion of the Longmont Infrastructure Master Plan
TOD support
Quality management support
DBE support for project closeout
Specialized planning and environmental support
Support for other ongoing projects as needed

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The total Contract Not to Exceed Amount for the CMSC contract would remain at $34,400,000 with
this time extension. All remaining funding for this contract is included in the 2020 Adopted Budget in
the specific projects where CMSC support would be utilized.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the recommended action. It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs &
FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the Interim General Manager to
approve a contract amendment to exercise the first option year of the Triunity-Hill Joint Venture
for Construction Management Support Consultant Services (CMSC) for FasTracks, extending the
contract end date to July 13, 2021, with no increase in the contract not-to-exceed amount.
Funding for the remainder of this contract is included in the 2020 Adopted Budget in the specific
projects where CMSC support would be utilized.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the Interim General Manager to
exercise the contract option. Instead, allow the contract to expire on July 13, 2020, and perform
the remaining work in-house with RTD staff. This is not recommended because RTD does not
have in-house staff with the institutional knowledge, background, and technical skills of the
specific staff to be retained through this time extension, and would not be able to replace their
expertise in a timely and cost-effective manner.

Authorization for Intergovernmental Agreement
(IGA) with the City of Boulder for the Transfer
of Used RTD Site Amenities

General

Board Meeting Date: April 7, 2020

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the Interim General Manager and CEO, or designee, to execute all documents
necessary to enter into an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with the City of Boulder, for the transfer
of ownership of 3 bus shelters, 4 benches, 6 trash receptacles, and 4 bike racks. Minor adjustments to
these quantities may be made if the project scope changes.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s goals:
Core Goal #5 - Effective Communications & Community Outreach
BACKGROUND
RTD currently has 9,702 bus stops, of which 330 are RTD-maintained. Adding amenities such as
shelters, benches, and trash cans provides a more comfortable environment to RTD patrons to wait, but
comes with initial capital and ongoing maintenance costs. RTD’s maintenance costs for a stop with
amenities are approximately $4,600-$5,600 each year. Several bus stops are maintained by local
agencies or by advertisers.
The City of Boulder is reconstructing Broadway on the north end of the City from Violet Ave. to US36.
There are currently six bus stops within the project area. All bus stops will be rebuilt as part of the
project. The City of Boulder would like to include site amenities at the bus stops for RTD patrons and is
seeking RTD’s assistance in providing these site amenities. RTD currently has the requested site
amenities in its salvage yard that could be transferred to the City for use on the project. The City has
agreed to take ownership of the amenities and to provide all ongoing maintenance at the stops within
the project area.
DISCUSSION
The City of Boulder has requested that RTD transfer ownership of 3 bus shelters, 4 benches, 6 trash
receptacles, and 4 bike racks. The City will take on ownership of the amenities and be responsible for all
future maintenance at the bus stops within the project area.
RTD currently has no shelters at the stops within the project area, and other amenities are also limited.
All southbound stops have a high number of boardings, and northbound stops have a high number of
alightings.
The proposed IGA includes provisions for transferring site amenities for 6 locations along Broadway St.
in the City of Boulder 1) Violet Ave. NB, (2) Yarmouth Ave. NB, (3) Lee Hill Dr. NB, (4) Lee Hill Dr. SB,
(5) Yarmouth Ave. SB, and (6) Violet Ave. SB. Key provisions of the IGA include the following:

Packet Pg. 28

2.B.2





RTD design/construction review and approval of bus stops
Maintenance responsibilities at bus stops
Transfer of ownership of shelters, benches, trash receptacles, and bike racks

The proposed IGA includes provisions that RTD will not be held responsible for any claims or liabilities
that result from Boulder’s actions or omissions.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
RTD will not provide any funding towards the construction or maintenance of the project.
The transferred amenities are currently in storage and have an estimated value of $28,560.
There would be no impact to RTD maintenance costs because RTD currently does not provide any
maintenance at the stops within the project area, and the City of Boulder will be responsible for all future
bus-stop maintenance.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs &
FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the Interim General Manager and
CEO or designee to execute all documents necessary to enter into an Intergovernmental
Agreement (IGA) with the City of Boulder, for the transfer of ownership of 3 bus shelters, 4
benches, 6 trash receptacles, and 4 bike racks. Minor adjustments to these quantities may be
made if the project scope changes.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action and do not enter into an IGA. This would result in
leaving several high-use, project-area bus stops without site amenities for our patrons, when a
reasonable mechanism to enable addition of the amenities is being proposed.

What is a System Optimization Plan (SOP)?
The SOP is a process that seeks to understand the community’s
transit goals and priorities and ultimately develops a
recommended service plan that balances them. Priorities
identified are expected to help guide transit investment in the
short- and mid-term.
After implementation of the SOP in 2021, the SOP will be
evaluated and adjusted three times per year as part of the normal
run board process by RTD staff to ensure that it continues to meet
the ever-changing needs of the region.

System Optimization plans vary from system
tweaks, like what RTD’s service develop
group does three times per year, to a full
system restructure.
The Reimagine RTD SOP falls somewhere in
the middle; it will maintain an existing core
network of routes and look at opportunities
to optimize others.

Core Network

DEVELOPING THE MOBILITY OF THE FUTURE

A similar core network of existing routes is included in each of
the four scenarios (defined on slide 13). These core network
routes are already optimized; they operate efficiently, carry a
high volume of riders, and serve key regional destinations.
Examples of core network routes include the Flatiron Flyer,
Broadway and Colfax routes. The core network accounts for
59% of the existing RTD system.
For each of the four scenarios, we will build upon the core
network to identify effective ways to provide service to key
areas of the District that reflect the goal of each scenario.

Four SOP Scenarios for Evaluation

DEVELOPING THE MOBILITY OF THE FUTURE

The Reimagine RTD team is currently developing four alternative RTD
transit system scenarios. The themes of the four scenarios were
developed by the project’s Technical Working Group and Advisory
Committee as well as RTD’s Citizen’s Advisory Committee and have been
reviewed with the RTD Board.
The evaluation of the four alternative scenarios is intended help the
committees and the RTD Board balance investment of limited transit
resources to best meet both the District’s regional mobility needs, and the
unique mobility needs of the District’s subregions. The evaluation of
scenarios and input from committees will be used to support
development of the recommended SOP.

RTD’s Utilization Analysis
The purpose of the Workforce Utilization Analysis: to identify EEO job categories where there is
underrepresentation and or concentration of minorities and women in relation to availability in our relevant
labor market (most recent census for our area of operation was used). Additionally, it establishes the
framework for goals and timetables and other actions to correct employment practices that contribute to
underrepresentation or concentration. A statistical breakdown of the job categories is cross-referenced by race
and gender. Percentage and numerical goals with timetables must be set to correct any underrepresentation
identified in the analysis. If goals and timetables are not met, RTD must justify why, including explaining job
openings that didn’t materialize, adequacy of recruitment, job descriptions, etc.
The following are the 8 EEO job categories:
1. Officials and Administrators
2. Professionals
3. Technicians
4. Protective Services
5. Paraprofessionals
6. Administrative Support
7. Skilled Craft
8. Service-Maintenance

Goals Met:
• Professional Minorities
• Paraprofessional Women

Goals Unmet:
• Professional Women
• Admin Support Women

The table above is a review of RTD’s workforce statistics in 2015 which identified underrepresentation of females in 3
EEO job categories: Professionals, Para-Professionals and Administrative Support and underrepresentation of
minorities in 2 EEO job categories: Professionals and Skilled Craft. The “addition rate” is the percentage of the
total increase needed to eliminate underutilization of that particular category. Percentage and numerical goals with
timetables were set for 4 years to correct any underrepresentation identified in the analysis.

Assessment of RTD’s Employment Practices
• FTA requires agencies to document their employment practices in both narrative and
statistical formats with sufficient detail to identify trends and any practices that may
operate as employment barriers to minorities and women.
• A proper assessment and identification of problem areas considers the impact of an
agency’s evaluation of external and internal factors such as:
Ø Applicants not knowing where to apply for jobs (external factor); and
Ø Recruitment, testing, hiring, promotions, transfers, seniority, training, compensation,
benefits, disciplinary procedures, and terminations.
• Based on RTD’s assessment of employment practices within the last 4 years, we did not
identify any trends or practices that may operate as employment barriers to minorities and
women.

Plan for Monitoring and Reporting on the EEO Program
•

Monitoring and reporting are key to ensure the agency’s implementation of the EEO Program Plan.
RTD’s staff evaluates key performance indicators of its EEO Program Plan and provide foundational and
identifiable solutions/corrective actions.
Ø We evaluate the results of action plans RTD has taken since our last submission of the EEO Plan to
the FTA in 2015.
Ø We evaluate goals and timetables throughout the year and look at trends and take proper
measures if corrective action is needed.
Ø We present and report relevant utilization analysis data, investigations, etc. to senior leadership
and management.
Ø We monitor records of personnel transactions at all levels to ensure that RTD’s EEO Policy is
carried out.
Ø We have a defined mechanism to review, approve and monitor our Transit
Management/Operations Contractor’s EEO Program Plans and Policy.

• RTD establishes these monitoring and reporting procedures for evaluation of the EEO Program for the
next 4 years and provide a proactive approach to facilitate the implementation of identifiable remedial
actions.
