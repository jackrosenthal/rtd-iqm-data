Special Recognitions


Youth Art Program
Chair Sisk indicated that we had some special guests in the audience that we wanted
to acknowledge. We wanted to recognize the Aurora and Cherry Creek Public schools
and the grand prize winners of the “I HEART MY RTD” pilot program. He then turned
it over to Steve Reilly, Marketing Manager, to do the introductions. Steve shared this
has been a wonderful opportunity to partner with the school systems and to help
educate them on the public transit system. In the process, we have built some
wonderful relationships that we hope to leverage for other community outreach
opportunities. He then introduced Georgann Van Gemert, Marketing Account
Executive, who was the coordinator and interface with the schools.
Georgann shared what an honor and pleasure it has been to work with the Aurora and
Cherry Creek School systems and the students. We had over 2400 students who
participated, about 16 schools and over 45,000 people who voted on line. Georgann
explained the process for selection including the Advisory committee and thanked
everyone for their help. She specifically thanked the marketing, graphics, Web group
and event manager who formed the backbone of the support as well as Lamar
Advertising who performed the wrap on the bus and RTD’s body shop who rigged the
unveiling. Special acknowledgement was given to graphic designer Joan Garcia who
worked with the students on their art to make it “bus wrap ready”. She thanked
Director Claudia Folska for the vision and Paula Perdue for the planning coordination.
She thanked the schools, educators and coordinators who worked with her to make it

happen. Representatives who were in attendance: Dr. John Kennedy, Executive
Director for Cherry Creek Middle Schools, Principal Marquetta Thomas and Art teacher
Genevieve Diets from Fox Ridge Middle School; Grand Prize winner Sydney Cole and
her parents from Fox Ridge Middle School; From Aurora Frontier Middle School:
Principal Cari Roberts, Assistant Principal Celi Leggett, Dean Thomas Gibbons and art
teacher Thad McCaulay; The grand prize winners Jenna Braun and Madison Baxter
with parent Michelle Flor and grandparents and friends.
A short video of the activities from the print shop to the celebratory events at the
school was provided by Channel 8 and shown to the Board.
Director Folska presented the winning students and schools with a framed copy of the
art.


Retiring Board Members
Chair Sisk recognized the two retiring Board members, Director Daly and Director
Rivera-Malpiede. He read the proclamation aloud honoring them for their services. A
copy of the proclamation is available in the Board office. Each of them were given a
departing gift from the Board.
General Manager Washington presented each with a plaque for their services to RTD.
He gave them a coin which he stated “This is his personal coin that you cannot
purchase, you must earn. It represents loyalty, integrity, discipline, and leadership.”
Director Daly commented what an honor it has been serving as Director for the last 8
years. He has worked with some spectacular people. He thanked staff for their work
and commitment to this agency. He stated one of his highlights was when we
selected General Manager Washington for the position. He has the utmost respect for
General Manager Washington, the direction he has provided to this agency and his
leadership.
Director Rivera-Malpiede stated that she too is humbled to have been able to serve
with some fantastic people and staff. She shared one of her greatest moment was
participating in the selection of the GM and serving as Secretary when the FFGA was
received. General Manager Washington has truly moved this agency forward and we
are renowned for many successes including the PP3, the WIN program and the
redevelopment of the multi-modal Denver Union Station. She stands on the shoulders
of other Board members who have come before her but we could not have been
successful without the great staff.
Both Directors received a standing ovation.

Public Participation

Dr. Michael Cummings, Denver, shared that he teaches politics and public policy. He is
currently working with and writing a book on youth in politics. He is happy to see RTD
join the worldwide youth movement by engaging the youth through this art contest.
What he see is engaging, inspiring and empowering. He noted the 2014 Nobel Peace
Prize given to Malala Yousafzay, a young girl who had the courage to stand up against
the Taliban who quoted “what was lost was not my life but fear.” We have to reach
beyond the fear to do the extraordinaire. This is a fantastic thing that RTD has done
and he recognized Director Folska for her vision for this program. He stated, it was
unfortunate that she could not actually see it. He will mention her in his book.
Dre Chiriboga-Flor, Denver, indicated she was representing 9-5 in advocating for
affordable options during our fare input process. She related a story of a woman with
3 children who had been unemployed but recently got a job. This women would have
to walk 3 miles each way to get her children to and from school. She encouraged
affordable options for more people.
Irene Rodriguez, using an interpreter, shared that she uses the bus and sometimes have
to walk 20 minutes to get her son to the doctor. Her son uses the bus also.
Sometimes when she is at the Doctor, she does not always get out early enough to
catch the bus and the bus pass time expires. She would like more consideration in the
fare options.
Guadalupe Pastelin, Denver, thanked RTD for working for a bus in Westwood. She has
3 daughters and sometimes when weighing her options, it is better to drive than ride
the bus. She is looking for more regional economical options.
Zoë Williams, 9-5, shared that many of their members are participating in the fare task
study. The focus on simplifying the fare structure is good but there needs to be more
discussion around affordability. She encourages looking at ridership. There is a study
that shows when the cost of ridership decreases, ridership increases dramatically. Our
community is the life line of RTD. There is a need for affordable access to schools,
doctor visits, grocery, etc.
Scott Kerr, Denver, stated that lower income pay more for transportation
proportionately than higher income. He finds it incredible that they have been speaking
on this issue for over a year with little to no change. We need to look for a creative
solution where the poor will not have to pay more than others who can better afford.
We need to work with 9-5 to ensure public transportation remains public.
Doug Gragg, Denver, offered an observation. He visited the Jefferson County
Detention Center via light rail. He noticed that Jefferson County gives them a pass
which does not pay the full cost of the fare. He knows this is not an RTD issue but he
still wanted to comment on this. He recognized Jannette Scarpino for how well she
presents information and thanked Scott Reed for his service. He also stated we have
wonderful security guards working at Denver Union Station.

VI.

Carolyn Ruiz, Arvada, spoke about the disparity of the fare for access-a-ride versus
access-a-cab. She commented that she had gotten stranded and someone from RTD
had taken her home.
Susan Gangler, Aurora, shared that she had been blind for the last 2-3 years. She
takes the light rail southeast to Union Station where she catches the bus to Boulder to
see her son. She shared this is about her freedom and independence. She is
concerned about safety from the LRT platform to the bus pavilion concourse. She
asked if RTD would put some tactile strips from the track leading to the Chestnut
Pavilion door.

Chair Sisk – Highlights and Year in review
2014 was such an eventful year that could not have been successful without Board and
staff cooperation. What is happening as a result of RTD and FasTracks is really a
spectacular thing. He hopes that everyone will take the time to think about how we can
be more kind and gentle in terms of how we treat one another. Chair Sisk acknowledged
that one of the true blessings for him this year has been his association with the other
Directors and staff.

General Manager's Report




General Manager Washington shared that the graduation for the 3rd annual RTD
Leadership Academy was Tuesday, December 16. This is part of solidifying the
succession plan. The Leadership Academy takes on projects that are beneficial to this
agency. To date all of the ideas have been implemented. The next class will start the
first of 2015.

XI.

General Manager Washington reported on a light rail accident that resulted in a fatality.
We have had our full safety and security team onsite and RTD is coopering fully with
the police. His heart goes to the family of the victim as well as the RTD LRT operator.
We have reported this to the NTSB.
The RTD-DIA dispute has been resolved in RTD’s favor. The issue had to do with cost
responsibility within a certain area; the normal arrangement is Denver for the station
and RTD for the tracks. The arbitration decision was appealed by DIA. The latest
ruling upheld the arbitrator’s decision and RTD pays $7.8M. It is important to note
that during this dispute, the work continued and the relationship between RTD and DIA
remains positive.
General Manager Washington acknowledged Terry Howerter, CFO, and stated this was
his last Board meeting as he will be retiring this year. Terry has been a tremendous
asset to this agency. He has made great contributions to the complex RTD finances.
Chair Sisk expressed thanks to Marla Lien and the legal team for their representation
during the RTD-DIA arbitration dispute.
