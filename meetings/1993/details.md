## IV. Special Recognitions

- Youth Art Program

Chair Sisk indicated that we had some special guests in the audience that we wanted to acknowledge.  We wanted to recognize the Aurora and Cherry Creek Public schools and the grand prize winners of the “I HEART MY RTD” pilot program.  He then turned it over to Steve Reilly, Marketing Manager, to do the introductions.  Steve shared this has been a wonderful opportunity to partner with the school systems and to help educate them on the public transit system.  In the process, we have built some wonderful relationships that we hope to leverage for other community outreach opportunities.  He then introduced Georgann Van Gemert, Marketing Account Executive, who was the coordinator and interface with the schools.

Georgann shared what an honor and pleasure it has been to work with the Aurora and Cherry Creek School systems and the students.  We had over 2400 students who participated, about 16 schools and over 45,000 people who voted on line.  Georgann explained the process for selection including the Advisory committee and thanked everyone for their help.  She specifically thanked the marketing, graphics, Web group and event manager who formed the backbone of the support as well as Lamar Advertising who performed the wrap on the bus and RTD’s body shop who rigged the unveiling. Special acknowledgement was given to graphic designer Joan Garcia who worked with the students on their art to make it “bus wrap ready”.  She thanked Director Claudia Folska for the vision and Paula Perdue for the planning coordination. She thanked the schools, educators and coordinators who worked with her to make it happen.  Representatives who were in attendance:  Dr. John Kennedy,  Executive Director for Cherry Creek Middle Schools, Principal Marquetta Thomas and Art teacher Genevieve Diets from Fox Ridge Middle School; Grand Prize winner Sydney Cole and her parents from Fox Ridge Middle School; From Aurora Frontier Middle School: Principal Cari Roberts, Assistant Principal Celi Leggett, Dean Thomas Gibbons and art teacher Thad McCaulay; The grand prize winners Jenna Braun and Madison Baxter with parent Michelle Flor and grandparents and friends.

A short video of the activities from the print shop to the celebratory events at the school was provided by Channel 8 and shown to the Board.

Director Folska presented the winning students and schools with a framed copy of the art.

- Retiring Board Members

Chair Sisk recognized the two retiring Board members, Director Daly and Director Rivera-Malpiede.  He read the proclamation aloud honoring them for their services.  A copy of the proclamation is available in the Board office. Each of them were given a departing gift from the Board.

General Manager Washington presented each with a plaque for their services to RTD.  He gave them a coin which he stated “This is his personal coin that you cannot purchase, you must earn.  It represents loyalty, integrity, discipline, and leadership.”

Director Daly commented what an honor it has been serving as Director for the last 8 years.  He has worked with some spectacular people.  He thanked staff for their work and commitment to this agency.  He stated one of his highlights was when we selected General Manager Washington for the position.  He has the utmost respect for General Manager Washington, the direction he has provided to this agency and his leadership.

Director Rivera-Malpiede stated that she too is humbled to have been able to serve with some fantastic people and staff. She shared one of her greatest moment was participating in the selection of the GM and serving as Secretary when the FFGA was received. General Manager Washington has truly moved this agency forward and we are renowned for many successes including the PP3, the WIN program and the redevelopment of the multi-modal Denver Union Station.  She stands on the shoulders of other Board members who have come before her but we could not have been successful without the great staff.

Both Directors received a standing ovation.

## V. Public Participation

- Dr. Michael Cummings, Denver, shared that he teaches politics and public policy.  He is currently working with and writing a book on youth in politics.  He is happy to see RTD join the worldwide youth movement by engaging the youth through this art contest. What he see is engaging, inspiring and empowering.  He noted the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize given to Malala Yousafzay, a young girl who had the courage to stand up against the Taliban who quoted “what was lost was not my life but fear.” We have to reach beyond the fear to do the extraordinaire.  This is a fantastic thing that RTD has done and he recognized Director Folska for her vision for this program.  He stated, it was unfortunate that she could not actually see it.  He will mention her in his book.

- Dre Chiriboga-Flor, Denver, indicated she was representing 9-5 in advocating for affordable options during our fare input process.  She related a story of a woman with 3 children who had been unemployed but recently got a job.  This women would have to walk 3 miles each way to get her children to and from school.  She encouraged affordable options for more people.

- Irene Rodriguez, using an interpreter, shared that she uses the bus and sometimes have to walk 20 minutes to get her son to the doctor.  Her son uses the bus also.  Sometimes when she is at the Doctor, she does not always get out early enough to catch the bus and the bus pass time expires.  She would like more consideration in the fare options.

- Guadalupe Pastelin, Denver, thanked RTD for working for a bus in Westwood.  She has 3 daughters and sometimes when weighing her options, it is better to drive than ride the bus. She is looking for more regional economical options.

- Zoë Williams, 9-5, shared that many of their members are participating in the fare task study.  The focus on simplifying the fare structure is good but there needs to be more discussion around affordability.  She encourages looking at ridership.  There is a study that shows when the cost of ridership decreases, ridership increases dramatically.  Our community is the life line of RTD. There is a need for affordable access to schools, doctor visits, grocery, etc.

- Scott Kerr, Denver, stated that lower income pay more for transportation proportionately than higher income.  He finds it incredible that they have been speaking on this issue for over a year with little to no change.  We need to look for a creative solution where the poor will not have to pay more than others who can better afford.  We need to work with 9-5 to ensure public transportation remains public.

- Doug Gragg, Denver offered an observation.  He visited the Jefferson County Detention Center via light rail.  He noticed that Jefferson County gives them a pass which does not pay the full cost of the fare.  He knows this is not an RTD issue but he still wanted to comment on this.  He recognized Jannette Scarpino for how well she presents information and thanked Scott Reed for his service.  He also stated we have wonderful security guards working at Denver Union Station.

- Carolyn Ruiz, Arvada, spoke about the disparity of the fare for access-a-ride versus access-a-cab.  She commented that she had gotten stranded and someone from RTD had taken her home.

- Susan Gangler, Aurora, shared that she had been blind for the last 2-3 years.  She takes the light rail southeast to Union Station where she catches the bus to Boulder to see her son.  She shared this is about her freedom and independence.  She is concerned about safety from the LRT platform to the bus pavilion concourse.  She asked if RTD would put some tactile strips from the track leading to the Chestnut Pavilion door.

Chair Sisk  – Highlights and Year in review

2014 was such an eventful year that could not have been successful without Board and staff cooperation.  What is happening as a result of RTD and FasTracks is really a spectacular thing.  He hopes that everyone will take the time to think about how we can be more kind and gentle in terms of how we treat one another.  Chair Sisk acknowledged that one of the true blessings for him this year has been his association with the other Directors and staff.

## X. General Manager's Report

- General Manager Washington shared that the graduation for the 3rd annual RTD Leadership Academy was Tuesday, December 16.  This is part of solidifying the succession plan.  The Leadership Academy takes on projects that are beneficial to this agency.  To date all of the ideas have been implemented.  The next class will start the first of 2015.

- This is also the launch of the 3rd Multi-Agency Exchange Program.

- General Manager Washington reported on a light rail accident that resulted in a fatality.  We have had our full safety and security team onsite and RTD is coopering fully with the police.  His heart goes to the family of the victim as well as the RTD LRT operator. We have reported this to the NTSB.

- The RTD-DIA dispute has been resolved in RTD’s favor.  The issue had to do with cost responsibility within a certain area; the normal arrangement is Denver for the station and RTD for the tracks.  The arbitration decision was appealed by DIA.  The latest ruling upheld the arbitrator’s decision and RTD pays $7.8M.  It is important to note that during this dispute, the work continued and the relationship between RTD and DIA remains positive.

- General Manager Washington acknowledged Terry Howerter, CFO, and stated this was his last Board meeting as he will be retiring this year.  Terry has been a tremendous asset to this agency.  He has made great contributions to the complex RTD finances.

- Chair Sisk expressed thanks to Marla Lien and the legal team for their representation during the RTD-DIA arbitration dispute.
