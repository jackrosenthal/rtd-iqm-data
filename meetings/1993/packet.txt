C. Updates

• Annual Squire Patton Boggs Report
Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager for Communications, informed the
Directors that the members of Squire Patton Boggs were running late due to
a meeting with staff. Committee Chair Folska used the opportunity to
encourage the Directors to review the agenda and ask questions after the
presentation.
Chair Sisk reminded the Directors that the events honoring the art contest
winners would happen on Monday, December 8 and Tuesday, December 9.
He commended the efforts of Committee Chair Folska and Paula Perdue,
Executive Director of the Board Office on the art contest. Chair Sisk asked
Committee Chair Folska to explain the details of the events. Committee
Chair Folska said that the I Heart My RTD contest came from how she feels
about RTD. She compared the contest participants to the Commuter Rail
ribbon cutting before the Government Relations Committee Meeting as they
are both the future of RTD. She said the contest combined art and
community engagement. Committee Chair Folska expressed that she got
teary-eyed when meeting the participants and winners at their schools. She
noted that the events of December 8 and 9 have quite a list of public and

Kevin O’Neill, Partner at Squire Patton Boggs, introduced Patricia Doersch,
Of Counsel for Squire Patton Boggs, Jared Fleisher, Attorney for Squire
Patton Boggs, and Mike Dino, Senior Public Policy Advisor for Squire Patton
Boggs. The Squire Patton Boggs team presented their briefing for the RTD
Board of Directors included in the Government Relations Committee Meeting
packet for December 2, 2014. The presentation covered RTD’s Recent
Achievements, Federal Priorities for 2015 and the 2015 Congressional Visit
Plan.
Committee Chair Folska asked Kevin O’Neill who from RTD the Squire
Patton Boggs team consulted when creating the presentation. Kevin O’Neill
replied that the team consulted with Sherry Ellebracht, RTD’s Government
Relations Officer, as they have done in previous years. Committee Chair
Folska said that the discussion during this presentation was the opportunity
for the Board to provide their feedback.
During the RTD’s Recent Achievements discussion, Kevin O’Neill said that it
was great to be part of the commuter rail ceremony. He added that his
team has worked with RTD throughout the years and remembers the preconstruction site. He noted that it was great to see how RTD has influenced
the region.
Patricia Doersch said that RTD has had great success in securing funding
from different sources, including Transportation Infrastructure Finance and
Innovation Act (TIFIA) for New Starts. She mentioned that RTD has the
national distinction of making itself available as a resource to other agencies.
Kevin O’Neill added that part of RTD’s success can be attributed to its
strong relationship with the Colorado Congressional delegation throughout
the years.
During the Federal Priorities discussion, the Squire Patton Boggs team
emphasized the following as priorities:
 Securing New Starts funding for EAGLE P3 FasTracks projects,
including Southeast extension

elected officials attending. She said that the wrapped bus will be at the RTD
Administrative Offices on December 16th prior to the Board Meeting. The
winners will be recognized during this meeting. She pointed out that the
winners asked that each design wrapped one side of the same bus, creating
unity. Committee Chair Folska finalized her remarks by commending RTD’s
marketing team on their flawless job. She expressed her gratitude to
Georgann Van Gemert, Marketing Account Executive, and Steve Reilly,
Manager for Marketing Communications.

Director Solano addressed the immigration subject. He stated that
transportation will offer new mobility to these new Americans. This mobility
will transport them to their means of employment. He stressed that it must
be a fair rate that is affordable in order to accommodate society as a whole.
The Squire Patton Boggs team continued with the presentation. They
discussed stakeholder engagement, the new transportation leaders in
Congress for 2015-2016, and the Directors’ visit to Congress and the
Department of Transportation. Mike Dino pointed out that during APTA’s
Legislative Conference the Senate will be in session while the House will be
in recess. He said that Squire Patton Boggs will manage the Directors’ time
responsibly.
Director Solano inquired regarding the repatriation tax. He noted that most
corporations get a tax break for doing businesses out of the country. He
asked about the likelihood of passing a repatriation tax given the new
makeup of Congress. Kevin O’Neill answered that repatriation is very
popular on a bipartisan basis. He said that the United States is one of the
few countries that taxes its corporations for income made abroad. He noted
that there are diverse opinions on how the repatriation tax funds should be
used. Patricia Doersch noted that Representative Dave Camp has proposed
a retroactive tax payable over 8 years. She said that Senator Michael
Bennet has proposed low interest long term bonds as a way to transfer
those funds to the country. Director Solano expressed his agreement with
Senator Bennet’s proposal.
Director Bagley asked about the chances of RTD receiving the $150 million
for the Eagle P3 project in 2015. He also inquired about the possibility of
the SE extension being funded. He reminded the Directors that RTD is
funding $65 million of the SE extension and that the private sector and local
community are funding $25-$40 million. Jared Fleisher replied that the
appropriation should be somewhere between $1.9 and $2 billion. He said
that would allow the Federal Transit Agency (FTA) to come very close to the

Kevin O’Neill noted that Congress is in the midst of a lame duck session. He
said that one of the processes being worked out is separating the
Department of Homeland Security into a short-term continuing resolution
(CR) instead of it being part of the long-term omnibus bill in order to address
immigration separately.

scheduled $150 million. Funding beyond 2015 will need to be figured out.
Kevin O’Neill added that the Squire Patton Boggs team will remind the
members of Congress of RTD’s excellent track record as well as the
extraordinary local and private sector match for the SE extension.

Director Tobiassen pointed out that the conversation every year seems to
follow the same cycle of “the sky is falling due to lack of funding” and every
year RTD and municipalities manage to find funding and move forward. He
said that solutions are only found when it becomes a burning problem. He
acknowledged that local and state governments are doing a great job of
making the system work. Patricia Doersch agreed with Director Tobiassen.
She added that we cannot keep crying wolf and that a more permanent
solution needs to be found. Jared Fleisher noted that the reason
transportation has been muddling through was due to the $62 million
transfer to the Highway Trust Fund. He wondered how long that would be
sustainable.
Director Lubow said that the MAP21 criteria that had put BRT restrictions on
RTD was created to benefit the “winners” and “losers” at the time. She
noted that she sensed the new political composition would change who the
“winners” and “losers” are and that this shift on politics may benefit RTD.
Jared Fleisher pointed out that this was a more articulate way of saying
what he was trying to say. Kevin O’Neill added that changes may happen
because the “long term winners” are looking at a much smaller pot of gold
and their objective is to shrink the pool of eligibility.
Director Lubow asked if anyone was following Oregon’s VMT pilot program.
Patricia Doersch said that Transportation and Infrastructure Committee
Chairman Shuster was following the pilot program, which includes creative
ways of tracking VMT while providing privacy. She said that we may see
lessons learned implemented in future transportation bills.
Director Lubow wondered if any further funding for the Northwest Area
Mobility Study (NAMS) Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) were washed out. Jared
Fleisher said that Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery
(TIGER) grants were challenging for RTD since the FTA has funded so much
through the New Starts program that the FTA feels they need to spread the
wealth. He pointed out that the Office of the Secretary of Transportation is
very cognizant of the amounts granted to RTD and Denver. Kevin O’Neill
added that RTD has picked every pocket available. He noted that the
Packet Pg. 9

Director Walker asked if the Vehicles Miles Traveled (VMT) tax was still
being discussed. Kevin O’Neill replied that it was still part of the
conversation. He added that due to privacy concerns it would most likely
not be included in the next bill.

6.A

staffing review process includes reviewing the projects and a degree of
politics. Director Lubow wondered if the situation would then be doom and
gloom for the small grant applications. Jared Fleisher replied that planning
projects have a better outlook than capital projects under TIGER grants.

Chair Sisk said he was pleased that Squire Patton Boggs was retained for
the next few years.
Chair Sisk agreed with Director Bagley’s two points and added a third:
arterial BRT as part of the conversation towards implementing NAMS.
Chair Sisk wondered how to maximize the Director’s presence during the
APTA Legislative Conference since the House would be on recess. He asked
if it would be necessary for so many Directors to attend. He said that this
could be discussed offline sooner rather than later as the timeline for
reservations was approaching. Kevin O’Neill suggested maybe planning a
trip while the full Congress is in session.
Director Daly noted that former Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood was
on 60 Minutes demonstrating infrastructure failures. Director Daly
wondered if Secretary LaHood had any traction with Congress anymore.
Kevin O’Neill replied that many have criticized Secretary LaHood for not
speaking when he had the President’s attention and speaking now on tax
increases when he is no longer the Secretary of Transportation. Kevin
O’Neill said that he now has different interests as he has people paying him
to promote an increase in funding for infrastructure.
Director James said that it was great to have the all-stars of the Squire
Patton Boggs on our team. He noted that funding is not so much about
RTD’s relationship with Congress but with the voters. If RTD gets
something done the voters will notice. Kevin O’Neill added that the new
Congress will be very inexperienced and controlled by the opposing party of
the White House. He noted that infrastructure is not political in nature thus
providing an opportunity to work together.
Director Hoy said that it was good to hear that the Federal Government has
never failed to pay a Full Funding Grant Agreement. He asked about the
$15 million IOU received about 2 years ago from the Federal Government in
Packet Pg. 10

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Dec 2, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Lubow expressed that she represents the Northwest area which has
no funding. North Metro and the Central Corridor are depending on future
funding as well. She asked the Squire Patton Boggs team to address the
FasTracks areas lacking funding. Kevin O’Neill replied that FasTracks has
succeeded because it has a commitment with realism. He said that every
success is a new opportunity to partner with the Federal Government.

conjunction with a $135 million check. He wondered if RTD would ever see
the $15 million. Kevin O’Neill said that RTD will see the money. The Full
Funding Grant Agreements are paid over a period of time, usually five years
with maybe a sixth year for the overage. Squire Patton Boggs will keep
pressing for early funding.

B. Recommended Actions

• Recommendation for Contract Award to Mass. Electric Construction
Company (MEC) for On-Call Systems Construction Services
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the
RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to award a contract
to Mass. Electric Construction Company (MEC), the most qualified firm
based on the application of the evaluation criteria, in the amount not to
exceed $67,229,300 for On-Call Systems Construction Services Contractor.
The work in this Contract includes providing new, retrofit, and emergency
construction services for the Overhead Contact System, Traction Power
Systems, Fare Collection Systems, Signal and Communication System, and
Trackwork construction services. Funding for the contract award is included
in the 2015 Adopted Capital Budget for current year projects. Funding for
future year projects will be authorized in future year budgets.
Motion:

Chair Sisk made the motion to move this item to
the full Board at the December 16, 2014 Board
meeting.
Director Tobiassen seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Rick Clarke, Assistant General Manager for Capital Programs,
introduced Frank Buczkowski, Sr. Manager for Systems
Engineering and Construction. Frank Buczkowski told the
Directors that the 5 year contract with Balfour Beatty

Director Folska expressed her confusion as the background
discussion seemed to be about FasTracks capital investments
yet the Directors are hearing about it during the Planning &
Development Committee meeting. She said that she was keen
to make sure RTD operations are safe, especially in light of the
recent IT failure, but the discussion made it sound like staff is
in a rush to spend $67 million. Rick Clarke explained that
most of the work is for base system operations. This does not
preclude the contractor from doing work on FasTracks
operations. He added that any expansion would have to come
from the FasTracks budget and the Directors would have to
approve it. Rick Clarke noted that the specialized contractor
will do electric work and software work for light rail. These
operations are separate from IT operations.
Director Lubow said that it would have been nice to have more
information on the discussion section of the Board report. She
noted that she could not tell from the report if this was base
operations or FasTracks. Frank Buczkowski said that one
project would be on FasTracks, at Sheridan on the West
corridor. This project is yet to be budgeted for. Once
budgeted, it will be sent to the Directors for approval. He said
this will happen in 2017.

Infrastructure, Inc. (BBII) expired. During the duration of the
contract, RTD and BBII did about $45 million work on
individually funded projects. This allowed for faster
completion of projects instead of individually bidding the
projects. He said that RTD has identified $67 million worth in
projects that would benefit from being addressed using the oncall contractor process. Some projects that will be addressed
once the contract in discussion is awarded are a light rail
power switch upgrade and a programmable logic controller
upgrade for the Southeast corridor. Projects will be addressed
as they get budgeted within their departments.

C. Updates
Susan Altes, Manager for Real Property, reviewed the Disposition of Surplus
Property Pilot Program presentation included in the Planning & Development
Committee meeting packet for December 2, 2014. The presentation gave
an overview of the properties in the program.
 Alameda & Havana Park-n-Ride
Susan Altes said that this property was sold to the adjacent property
owner, Mike Naughton Ford, as was approved by the Board in December,
2013, as part of the Disposition of Surplus Property Pilot Program.
Committee Chair James clarified that this property was originally
acquired when RTD purchased the land to build the Alameda & Havana
Park-n-Ride, which is just south of the vacant land. Susan Altes stated
that was correct.


13th & Zuni
Susan Altes noted that this property, the remainder from Siegel Oil, was
purchased for the West Corridor. RTD has received several inquiries
regarding the property. The property requires Federal Transit
Administration (FTA) approval to be disposed. RTD has sent the FTA the
request for disposal. The Request for Proposals (RFP) will be available
during the first quarter of 2015. The RFP will require consideration of
Transportation Oriented Development (TOD) as desired by the City and
County of Denver (Denver).



104th & Riverdale
Susan Altes explained that this property was bought for a Park-n-Ride in
relation to the SkyRide. Staff is in the process of meeting with the City
of Thornton, the adjacent property owner, and RTD Transit Oriented
Communities (TOC) staff members. The adjacent owner is the only one
who has shown interest in the property. Staff recommends holding on
to the property as it is within a mile from the planned Colorado Boulevard
station on the future North Metro line.



13525 Weld County Road 8 and 2542 Weld County Road 27
Susan Altes noted that these properties were acquired by Union Pacific
and assigned to RTD. She said she has met with the City of Brighton
and the Mayor of Ft. Lupton to brainstorm marketing possibilities. Both
properties have had inquiries. The County Road 27 property has
received an offer.

She said that staff is still working on reviewing the policies for disposition of
property through unsolicited proposals and is not ready to make a

Committee Chair James asked staff what they have learned about
methodology of disposing property through this process. Susan Altes replied
that staff has learned that markets cannot be created and that an interest
must exist first. Contacting the adjacent owner of the Alameda & Havana
property worked out brilliantly. She noted that staff will learn more as they
continue to work with the adjacent owner of the 104th & Riverdale property.
Bill Sirois added that the Alameda Bus Barn site, which is not part of the
Disposition of Surplus Property Pilot Program, will also provide some
insights. He noted the similarities between the Bus Barn site and the 13th &
Zuni property.
Director Folska asked for the appraisal and final sale amounts for the
Alameda & Havana property. Susan Altes answered that the property sold
for $1.2 million. She said the property was appraised for lower and that she
used her Board approved ability to negotiate within a percentage of the
appraised value. Rick Clarke, Assistant General Manager for Capital
Programs, told Director Folska that staff will contact her with the specific
figures.
Director Folska asked staff if they were considering a ground lease versus
selling the Weld County Road 27 property. She suggested this as a way of
receiving revenue in perpetuity. Susan Altes said that this could be a
possibility. She added that the Weld properties are outside of the District.
Rick Clarke mentioned that each property needs to be looked at on a case by
case basis in order to assess the interest in owning versus leasing. Director
Folska affirmed that the key is marketing. She noted that good marketers
can create a market where there is none. She said that the Board has
excelled at finding alternative streams of revenue to support base
operations. She wondered what could be other areas for funding, such as
naming rights, asset inventory, etc.
Director Tobiassen mentioned that he was glad to see movement in these
properties. He noted from his experience on the E-470 Board that some
properties have mineral rights. Susan Altes said that RTD does not own the
mineral rights for the Weld properties. She added that RTD has been
contacted about leasing the surface by the mineral rights owners; they
propose paying an up=front fee and then a royalty if anything is found.
Director Tobiassen said that such investment may not be worth it.
Director Bagley said that ground leases may be a more marketable option in
densely populated areas. Areas with less population tend to lean towards
owning. Committee Chair James added that ground leases may occur in

recommendation to the Board. Susan Altes noted that she will be working
with Bill Sirois, Senior Manager for TOD, to develop a policy for disposition
of real property. This policy will be presented to the Board for approval.

some areas. He said that the interest depends on the particular market and
the many variables that influence each one. Bill Sirois noted that there is a
ground lease option on the Bus Barn site’s RFP. Staff is hoping to let the
market respond. He agreed that some developers are hesitant on ground
leases while others have recently showed some interest.

Chair Sisk told staff that it would have been helpful to add to the
presentation the acres per property. He said that a narrative report
explaining lessons learned and other aspects of the pilot program would
have enriched the presentation.
Committee Chair James noted that disposing of these properties involve a
lot of moving targets and judgments. He wondered if a policy may be too
specific for the constant changes in the market and needs. He said the key
is to stay focused on RTD’s mission: what is in the best interest of RTD with
the assets.
Director Hoy commended staff on the progress made on the pilot program.
He said that he had no problem holding on to property if it would be
beneficial for the agency. He noted that in some cases it may be in the best
interest to dispose of the property. Director Hoy pointed to staff to be the
ones doing the work and tell the Directors what makes sense.
Director Hoy agreed with Chair Sisk in how a short narrative on the pilot
program would have been helpful to the discussion.
Director Deadwyler expressed that one of the things she is hoping to focus
on going forward is how RTD can generate additional revenue. She
wondered if perhaps RTD does not have the right staff that knows how to
generate revenue. She said that it pains her to hear that RTD staff sold
property below market value. Director Deadwyler does not believe RTD is
that desperate that we need to sell at any cost; she thinks that holding on to
property while the economy comes around to get more money is a better
idea. Committee Chair James clarified that the property sold was not sold
under value. Susan Altes stated that was correct as the Alameda & Havana
property was actually sold for above market value.

D. Other Matters
No other matters were presented.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Dec 2, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Chair Sisk agreed with Director Folska in looking at available opportunities.
He said he was pleased to see TOC and properties working together. He
also agreed in holding the 104th & Riverdale property as the market will grow
in the next few years.

B. Recommended Actions

• Approval of On-to-Off and Onboard Passenger Surveys Consultant Selection
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD
Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to execute all
documents necessary to award a contract to ETC Institute for the
completion of an on-to-off and onboard passenger surveys project for an
amount not to exceed $1,435,000. Funding is included in the FasTracks
2015 budget.
Motion:

Director Bagley made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the December 16, 2014
Board meeting.
Director Anderson seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Lee Cryer, Planning Project Manager, explained that this
contract would cover two types of surveys: on-to-off and
onboard passenger surveys. He noted that the Federal Transit
Administration (FTA) requires recipients of Full Funding Grant
Agreements (FFGAs) to complete “Before and After” studies
as well as regularly updating travel forecasting models for
projects receiving grants. The data from the surveys will be
used in the development of the required “Before and After”

Directors Deadwyler and Solano participated via phone. Directors Lasater and RiveraMalpiede were absent.

studies for the West Rail Line (“After” portion) and the Eagle
Project (“Before” portion).

Director Tobiassen asked for further information about the
company that would be conducting the surveys, ETC Institute.
Lee Cryer stated that they are a small Market Research Firm
out of suburban Kansas City. He said they do many
transportation surveys for similar peer agencies around the
country.
Chair Sisk commented that when he read the recommended
action it gave him heartburn related to the cost of $1.435
million and what RTD would get in return. He understands
that RTD needs to comply with the FTA’s requirements but
wonders if this is something RTD could do internally. Chair
Sisk believes there are better things RTD could be doing with
this money. Lee Cryer noted that these surveys also benefit
RTD as they will be an excellent supplement to the data that
we already collect.
Director Walker asked what response rate is expected or how
many surveys we hope to collect. Lee Cryer stated that the
goal is to get a response rate from about 10% of our
boardings.
Director Folska reiterated Chair Sisk’s concerns that we were
not doing these surveys in house. She thinks this is a large
amount of money for something that RTD has the facilities to
do. She noted the great work done in-house by Dennis
Yaklich, Manager of Market Research. Lee Cryer pointed out
that most of RTD’s data collection is contracted out as well.
Director Anderson believes these kinds of studies are always
important because RTD finds out where our riders are going
and where they are coming from. She stated that she will
support this recommendation as she thinks this will give RTD
valuable information for the future.
Packet Pg. 21

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Dec 2, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Lee Cryer shared that for an on-to-off study, each passenger is
handed a card as they board that shows where they got on.
These cards are collected as they get off with the surveyors
noting the destination. He said that onboard surveys are more
complex. Passengers are randomly selected and the surveyor
will not only attempt to get detail trip information but also
important demographic data as well.

Director Menten thanked Lee Cryer for his responsiveness in
answering her questions earlier. She said that she still had
several questions as follows:
 How often is RTD required to conduct District wide
surveys?
 When was the last time RTD conducted a District wide
survey?
 How many people does RTD need to sample in a
survey?
 Where can she read the FTA’s requirements regarding a
District wide survey?
Lee Cryer explained that as it relates to District wide surveys
the FTA does not have specific requirements, just general
guidelines. He said the last time RTD did a complete District
survey was in 2008. The guidelines recommend doing this
type of survey every 5 to 10 years. In terms of requirements
for the “Before and After” studies, this recommendations
meets and supports those requirements. He said he would
work with Director Menten to help her get further information
on the FTA guidelines relating to the District wide surveys.
Director Menten inquired if there would be a penalty if RTD did
not comply with the “Before and After” studies. Brian Welch,
Planning Technical Services Manager, explained that this was
something mandated by Congress as a way to track how
these project receiving tax dollars have performed. He
believes this type of information has and will benefit other
projects and transit agencies. Marla Lien, General Counsel,
pointed out that RTD has already received the money so there
is very little the FTA could to do to get it back; however, the
biggest issue is that RTD applies for federal grants all the time.
If RTD starts violating the terms of our grant contracts any
new applications will not go well in the future.
General Manager Washington stated that this is really about
RTD’s track record of doing things right, start to finish. He
said that regardless of the penalty, completing the “Before and
After” studies just further shows RTD’s credibility by doing
everything right. General Manager Washington recognized the
comments made by several Directors about doing the surveys
in-house; however, RTD does not have the expertise to do
these surveys internally. He explained that staff always
evaluates the benefit of hiring someone for a specific task or

working with a consultant, and in this case working with a
consultant was the best option.

Director James wonders if there is an opportunity for RTD to
work with the FTA on the “how” of conducting these surveys.
He wonders if there are more cost effective options for
completing the surveys that are not allowed because of the
FTA’s requirements. He asked if it would be possible to use
smartphone data as a way of gathering this kind of data in a
more effective manner. Lee Cryer pointed out that while this
would be a way to learn about people’s trip origin and
destination, it would not provide the further in-depth
demographic information that we need.
Director Deadwyler noted Brian Welch’s comment that the
data being collected helps other agencies. She wonders how
the study data collected so far has benefitted RTD. Lee Cryer
stated that staff has coordinated with the FTA and other
similar agencies on the components of the Request for
Proposal. Director Deadwyler asked if we are paying a
comparable amount for these surveys when looking at similar
agencies. Lee Cryer stated that it was comparable.
Director Solano inquired how many employees ETC Institute
has and as to their qualifications. Lee Cryer said that he did
not know the exact number of employees; however, he
explained that they would be using local subcontractors to do
the surveying. He stated that the individuals working for ETC
Institute are market research experts with backgrounds in
analysis, statistics, etc.

FasTracks Citizens Advisory Committee Appointments
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD
Board of Directors reappoint three members of the Regional Transportation
District’s (RTD) FasTracks Citizens Advisory Committee to an additional
three-year term and appoint three new members to the Committee to a
three-year term.
Motion:

Chair Sisk made the motion to move this item to
the full Board at the December 16, 2014 Board
meeting.
Director Tobiassen seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager of Communications,
asked Roger Sherman, CRL Associates and Citizens Advisory
Committee (CAC) Liaison, to review the appointments with the
Board.
Roger Sherman shared that three of the four members eligible
for reappointment asked the Nominating Committee to do so.
In addition, there were 14 applicants for the openings. The
Nominating Committee selected five for interviews. He said
that they were impressed with all five and have even talked to
the two who were not selected about being alternates. He
pointed out that all five of the finalists were graduates of the
Transit Alliance’s Citizen Academy. Roger Sherman
recognized Heather Cronenberg who was in the audience. He
noted that Bill Maestas attended the Commuter Rail Car
unveiling but was not able to attend the meeting due to a prior
commitment.

C. Updates

• Eagle P3 Project Update

Brian Middleton, Program Manager for Eagle P3, reviewed a Power Point
presentation with the Board that is available in the December 2, 2014
FasTracks Monitoring Committee Agenda Packet. He stated that everything
is progressing very well with civil design work almost 100% complete and
construction at 67% complete; this means the project is on schedule for
revenue service in 2016. He reminded the Board that in September staff
advised them of the issue with the Jersey Cutoff Bridge. He said that the
reconstruction is going very well and should not impact the schedule. He
reiterated that RTD is not incurring any costs for replacing the bridge.
Brian Middleton shared that an Independent Design Check (IDC) has been
done on all structures and reviewed by RTD staff. He stated that through
the IDC a number of design deficiencies were identified; DTP is developing
fixes that will be approved by RTD before they are implemented. He
stressed that these deficiencies do not affect the safety of the general
public. The issues really affect the durability of the structures, not the
capacity. Brian Middleton explained that, similar to the Jersey Cutoff
Bridge, RTD is not responsible for any costs associated with correcting the
design deficiencies. He commented that while this is a very significant
issue, the approach that DTP has adopted is very positive.
Committee Chair Hoy stated that the Commuter Rail Car unveiling was very
exciting. He thinks that for many people this makes the project feel like a
reality.
Director Bagley thought it was great to be able to view the new vehicles.
He commented that recently there have been many news stories about the
issues regarding the hotel and station at DIA. He wonders if there is any
validity to these concerns. Brian Middleton stated that DIA’s challenges
were not affecting RTD at all. The airport station is largely complete and the
coordination between our contractor and DIA has been amazing. Rick Clarke
noted that early in the project it was identified that one of the biggest risks
would be DIA not finishing their work on-time, therefore interfering with our
schedule; however, DIA finished their commitments as planned.

Packet Pg. 25

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Dec 2, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Rick Clarke, Assistant General Manager of Capital Programs, thanked
everyone who attended the Commuter Rail Car unveiling. He stated that
receiving the vehicles is really a huge milestone for RTD. He said Hyundai
Rotem has been great to work with and the cars really are incredible
machines.

6.C

Director Bagley said that it was his understanding that the station addition
policy in reference to the 64th and Tower station had not yet been passed by
the Board. He wondered what Board action was required to build this
station. Brian Middleton pointed out that the IGA with CCD and DIA
contained a provision for two additional stations. Marla Lien explained that
the Board had already given its approval through approval of the IGA.
Director Lubow asked if the number of design deficiencies identified through
the IDC was in line with, more than, or less than staff would expect for a
project this size. Brian Middleton stated that the magnitude of the
deficiencies is abnormal. Director Lubow expressed concern that there
might have been a lapse in oversight. Brian Middleton reiterated that none
of the defects affect safety; they are really related to the required lifespan of
60 years. Rick Clarke reminded the Board that due to the structure of a P3
RTD is held harmless. If RTD was working directly with the designer we
could be in big trouble. Director Lubow asked if DTP has explained why the
errors occurred. Brian Middleton said that staff had been focused on getting
they errors fixed but would do a thorough investigation once that process
was complete.
Director Walker shared that he has been part of several construction projects
and he has yet to see one without errors. The important thing is that they
are caught and fixed now rather than later. He expressed how impressed he
is with the team hanging 47,900 door hangers. Director Walker believes
that person to person contact is invaluable; this is the kind of contact that
really counts when it comes to public perception.
Director Deadwyler inquired if Smith Road was in fact fully open. She
thought Brian Middleton mentioned that as part of the presentation but
when she drove through several days before and it was not fully open.
Brian Middleton said he would look into it further and get back to Director
Deadwyler.

Packet Pg. 26

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Dec 2, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Bagley inquired about the two potential stations that were part of
our Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with DIA and the City and County of
Denver (CCD), one at the Fulenwider property and one around 64th and
Tower. Brian Middleton stated that the station at the Fulenwider property is
under construction. It is a matter of determining if there is a need for the
station on opening day based on the maturity of development in the area.
Rick Clarke noted that it is good that platforms are complete because it
would be very difficult to construct them under revenue service. Brian
Middleton shared that there are continuing conversations about the station
at 64th and Tower, but staff has been very clear that construction on this
station will not begin until after revenue service has begun.

6.C

Director Solano wondered why the Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility
(CMRF) was only given a Temporary Certificate of Occupancy (TCO). Brian
Middleton explained that was the normal process. The TCO is issued so that
people may work in the building and finish the inside. Once that is complete
the building will be issued the final Certificate of Occupancy.

General Manager Washington stressed the beauty in the P3 delivery model.
This method requires that the private sector has “skin in the game”. He
reiterated that it is the in the best interest of DTP to repair, replace, etc. the
bridges now rather than once the line is in revenue services due to the terms
of the availability payments. He believes in a straight design-build the
contractor would be trying to walk away and give us the keys to a bad
bridge.

D. Other Matters
Director Walker reminded the Board that the Approval of the Investment Policy was
postponed at the last Financial Administration and Audit Committee Meeting to the
December 9, 2014 Meeting. He said that a summary of changes will be included in
this weeks’ packet. Director Walker noted that as of yet no one has called Terry
Howerter, Chief Financial Officer, or staff to discuss the revisions. He encouraged
the Board to meet with staff before Tuesday should they need clarification.

B. State of the District Address (Phil Washington)
Phil Washington, General Manager, provided a presentation on his State of the
District address reviewing the 2014 goals, achievements and challenges as well as
identifying 2015 goals and anticipated challenges for each department.
General Manager Washington shared that this annual presentation is key as it lets
the Directors and staff know where RTD has been, where we are, and what the
challenges are for the near future.
General Manager Washington stated that the District remains sound. RTD faces
many challenges that are being addressed with opportunities that are achievable.
He said that the State of the District is one of learning, empowerment,
accountability, interoperability, and achievement.
The full presentation of the State of the District Address is available in the
December 9, 2014 Financial Administration and Audit Committee Meeting Agenda
Packet.
Director Menten asked for the benefits of hosting the National Transportation
Institute’s training on the new changes to the Disadvantage Business Enterprise
(DBE) regulations. She wondered if this meant complementary passes (comps)
would be available for all employees since the registration fee is $450. General
Manager Washington explained that when an agency hosts a conference the usual
is around 10 comps. He said that this conference will be a great time to develop
staff and that the registration is well worth it.

Director Solano inquired regarding the State of Good Repair of the 16th Street Mall
shuttles since RTD has not been able to buy new ones. Bruce Abel, Assistant
General Manager for Bus Operations, explained that RTD was not successful in the
attempt to replace the 16th Street Mall shuttles. Staff sent another bid and has
received two proposals that are under review by the maintenance and procurement
staff. Bruce Abel said that in the interim the maintenance staff is going above and
beyond doing what is necessary to keep the 16th Street Mall shuttles on the road.
This includes essentially manufacturing parts that are not available anymore.
Committee Chair Walker called for a 5 minute recess at 6:32 p.m.
Committee Chair Walker resumed the meeting at 6:38 p.m.

C. Recommended Actions

• Investment Policy
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors adopt the Investment Policy Statement (the “Policy”),
attached.
Motion:

Director Bagley made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the December 16, 2014
Board Meeting.
Director Folska seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Terry Howerter, Chief Financial Officer, explained that this
item was postponed from the November 18, 2014 Financial
Audit and Administration Committee Meeting. Terry Howerter
introduced Brendan Morgan, Manager for Debt and
Investments. Brendan Morgan explained that staff solicited
the expertise, knowledge, and recommendations of its
investment advisor in revising the Policy. He noted that the
recommended changes, which are highlighted in the Board of
Directors Report for the Investment Policy Recommended
Action, are mainly in response to changes made to Colorado
State Statutes in 2014.
Director Lubow thanked staff for providing more information
on this matter.

Director Menten asked staff to expand on the fact that there were no protested
contracts during 2014. Marla Lien, General Counsel, clarified that this meant no
other bidder legally challenged the award of a contract.

Committee Chair Walker declared the motion PASSED UNANIMOUSLY.

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee
that the Board of Directors adopts the 2015 Final Performance Measures
proposed recommendations for Goals 3.1, 6.2, and 6.3. The final
recommendations for these goals are made after the 2015 Budget is
adopted in November to reflect budget estimates.
Motion:

Director Anderson made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the December 16, 2014
Board Meeting.
Director Bagley seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Terry Howerter, Chief Financial Officer, reminded the Directors
that goals 3.1, 6.2, and 6.3 are finalized after the 2015
Budget adoption in November because these goals are
contingent upon budget amounts and available resources.
Director Menten noted the drop in estimated revenue on the
West line. She asked if any of the figures on these goals
included updates from naming rights. Phil Washington,
General Manager, replied that staff is still working on naming
rights and that the performance measures do not include any
revenue from them.
Director Folska asked about the naming rights status,
specifically how much longer does RTD work with a contractor
before they deliver. Scott Reed, Assistant Manager for
Communications, replied that staff is working closely with
IMG, the contractor for naming rights. IMG has been
aggressive in pursuing naming rights and agreements. Scott
Reed pointed out that the naming rights project is a fairly large
ticket item built into 2015 budgets. Committee Chair Walker
asked that any further discussion on the naming rights be
taken offline as it was not relevant to the approval of the
2015 Final Performance Measures.

Management Trustees Appointed to RTD/ ATU 1001 Trusts
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors pass the attached resolution authorizing retention of
defense counsel and payment of all defense costs, and procurement of
insurance if available for management trustees appointed to the RTD/ATU
1001 Health and Welfare and Pension Trusts, without reservation of rights
of recovery of such costs regardless of any determination of liability, to the
extent such defense costs are not covered by the trusts or their insurers.
Motion:

Director Anderson made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the December 16, 2014
Board Meeting.
Director Tobiassen seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Terry Howerter, Chief Financial Officer, asked Marla Lien,
General Counsel, to present this recommended action to the
Directors.
Marla Lien explained that the Collective Bargaining Agreement
(CBA) call for the RTD/ATU 1001 Health and Welfare Trust
and the RTD/ATU 1001 Pension Trust to be administered by
three management appointed and three ATU appointed
trustees. As new appointees step into the trustee roles, staff
recommends that they be protected from liability.
Director Lubow asked regarding the timing of the
recommendation. She wondered why staff is recommending
this now. Marla Lien explained that there are past lawsuits.
She said that it is important to take into consideration the
fiduciary responsibility asked from the trustees as Phil
Washington, General Manager, asks new people to take on
that role. Director Lubow wondered if providing defense
counsel and payment of defense of cost is typical of other

6.D

agencies. Marla Lien replied that she could not speak to that
as she was not aware of many major trusts with the 3
management appointed and 3 Union appointed trustees.

Director Solano recalled from the State of the District
presentation that one of the positions in the Legal Department
is a risk manager lawyer. He wondered if this person reviewed
any arising issues. Marla Lien clarified that the Risk Manager,
currently Robert Medina, is not an attorney. She said that she
reviews with him any arising issues. If the issues are not
provided for, then staff adds it to RTD’s fiduciary structure.
As an example, she noted that RTD has a fiduciary structure
to protect the Directors.
Director Deadwyler asked if the appointed trustees were
competent enough to foresee when and if they are getting
themselves into trouble in order to avoid problems before they
happen. Marla Lien replied that Phil Washington appoints the
trustees and she provides legal feedback. Phil Washington
added that he believes the three appointees are very
competent. He said that he appointed people whose
combined skillset are necessary to understanding health and
welfare pension funds:
 Understanding of Accounting and Finance: Doug
MacLeod, Manager for Financial Reporting
 Understanding of Union Issues: Bruce Abel, Assistant
General Manager for Bus Operations
 Understanding the District and its Employees: Beverly
Lindsey, Employee Liaison.
Phil Washington explained that any action by the trust requires
a unanimous decision by the three management-appointed
trustees and the three Union trustees. He added that it is hard
to say if the composition is typical since he has not seen
anything similar in the nation. Phil Washington said that
regardless of what other agencies do, it is the right step for
RTD to provide defense for employees in the trustee position.
Director Anderson agreed with Phil Washington. She noted
that legal protection is the Director’s obligation and duty to the
Packet Pg. 33

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Dec 9, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Lubow asked if this protection would only come into
play if the contract was breached. Marla Lien replied that if
the insurance picks up the defense then RTD will not have to.
However, the insurance is limited and at times the allegations
made will leave the person without defense.

6.D

Director Menten asked which party, RTD or the Union, wanted
to have this trustee setup. Phil Washington said that this item
has been part of the CBA for probably 30 years. She asked if
RTD could renegotiate the contract with a 30 day notice. Phil
Washington replied that we could. Director Menten said that
it seems like the CBA is flawed. She added that due to
contract wording, tax payers are contributing money into a
health insurance plan for employees that do not exist.
Director Menten said she would vote no due to the potential
cost to tax payers and the potential of putting RTD employees
in legal jeopardy.
Chair Sisk agreed with Director Anderson’s comments. He
noted that Director Menten made a good point, yet revising
the CBA is another issue to be dealt with separately. He looks
forward to voting yes on this recommended action.
Committee Chair Walker agreed with Chair Sisk. He noted the
point made by Director Menten. He added that he doubts he
would be a Director if he was not protected as he has seen his
name on a couple of lawsuits. Committee Chair Walker said
that the Directors owe this legal protection to the employees.
Director Lubow recalled her unpleasant experience being
personally sued while working in a Federal position. She
added that the department took time to decide if it would
protect her, which was very stressful. Director Lubow said
she would vote yes because the employees need to be
protected.
Director James agreed with Director Menten about the CBA;
however, he noted that in the short term, legal protection of
the employees appointed as trustees is the right thing to do.
Director Deadwyler said that she would vote yes. She asked if
staff is concerned that trustees may be sued due to CBA
flaws. Phil Washington replied that the flaws on the CBA are
not a cause of concern. He noted that anyone can sue
anyone. Marla Lien added that lawsuits happen when funds
run low and people get angry.
Packet Pg. 34

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Dec 9, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

staff serving as trustees. She explained that this would
protect trustees if sued personally. She added that any of the
Directors could be sued, yet the fiduciary structure indemnifies
the Directors.

• Enhance IT Disaster Recovery Capabilities
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors authorizes the General Manager to take all necessary
actions and to execute all documents necessary to partially fund Information
Technology’s Disaster Recovery (DR) infrastructure and systems. This is an
amount of approximately $1.2 million.

Director Solano asked if the Risk Manager position is still
necessary. Marla Lien replied that the largest part of the Legal
Department’s budget is risk management as it covers many
facets across the District: workers comp, bus and rail,
property, fiduciary claims based on Title VI and Title VII,
among others.

6.D

Motion:

Director Tobiassen made the motion to move
this item to the full Board at the December 16,
2014 Board Meeting.

Discussion:

Motion to
Amend:

Director Hoy shared his concern with funding the
enhancement to IT Disaster Recovery capabilities with funds
from the sale of property that should go to the FasTracks
Internal Savings Account (FISA). He stated that using these
funds would not hold true to the agreement to funding the
FISA. He noted that he is not speaking against buying the
necessary IT equipment, yet he suggested to not use funds
that are from the sale and proceeds of the Alameda & Havana
land.

Director Hoy made the motion to amend the recommended
action to read as stated by Marla Lien, General Counsel:

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors authorizes the General Manager to take all necessary
actions and to execute all documents necessary to partially fund Information
Technology’s Disaster Recovery (DR) infrastructure and systems. This is an
amount of approximately $1.2 million. Funding is to exclude land sale
proceeds as a source of funds for the IT Disaster Recovery equipment.
Director Lubow seconded the motion.
Discussion:

Director Deadwyler disagreed with the amendment. She
believes that the IT situation is critical and RTD should use the
money from the sale of the land to repair. She said she
understands why reserves for FasTracks and base operations
are needed, yet IT should be updated so the agency does not
experience a similar problem in the next couple of years.
Director Lubow agreed that IT needs to be taken care of after
the mini crisis a few weeks ago. She said that she was
concerned that using the money from the FISA would take
away from the unfunded corridors. This would mean $1.2
million not going to the northern communities. She pointed
out that from the Board of Directors Report it was not clear
what would be obtained with $1.2 million.
Director James agreed with Director Hoy in that the IT system
is an emergency that needs to be solved. He said that using
Packet Pg. 36

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Dec 9, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Folska seconded the motion.

6.D

Director James asked staff what the rational was in using the
FISA. Terry Howerter, Chief Financial Officer, noted that there
is a need to fund the IT Disaster Recovery enhancements. He
noted that there are 3 funds that staff and Directors would like
to fund to $30 million:
 Board Restricted Fund, which the Board can authorize
expenditures from.
 Capital Acquisition Fund
 Unrestricted Fund, which fluctuates with revenue and
capital projects expenses.
Terry Howerter said that the Unrestricted Fund is where funds
would usually be drawn from for items such as the IT Disaster
Recovery enhancements. He added that this fund in 2015
would only have $8.6 million to use without going to the
Board and requesting from the Capital Acquisition or Board
Restricted Fund.
Director Anderson stated that she is against the amendment.
She said that RTD has a real emergency. Without IT, she
noted, RTD cannot run FasTracks, buses, trains or anything.
She added that she does not see anything in the near future
that will need FISA funding. She expressed her concern over
the approved budget and the lack of deep reserves.
Director Bagley asked staff how much money is in the FISA
and where the funding came from. Terry Howerter replied
that there is $21,509,000. He said that about $9 million
came from the Southwest extension Union Pacific tracks
relocation. The selling of air rights contributed $5.5 million.
Director Bagley reiterated that almost half of the funding came
from the relocation of the Union Pacific tracks because it was
better to do the project as one. He stated that he is a
regionalist and voted for delaying this project despite it
benefitting his district, so he will be voting against the
amendment.
Packet Pg. 37

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Dec 9, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

money from the reserves is consistent with the purpose of
having reserves. He asked if the stated use of FISA fits
funding something like IT systems. Director Hoy replied that
the FISA is meant to fund all of FasTracks: not just the
Northern Corridor but all unfunded corridors and extensions.
He stated that the FISA is not intended to fund computer
replacements. He added that contingency money is there to
fund emergencies. Director James said that this answered his
question.

Chair Sisk recalled that the budgets for 2015 and 2016 have
appropriated moneys for IT Disaster Recovery Enhancements.
Terry Howerter explained that there is appropriated money for
State of Good Repair and replacement of assets, not for
Disaster Recovery. He added that the Disaster Recovery took
about 3 days on the email outage. If the Disaster Recovery
storage units would have been in place, recovery would have
taken place in a few hours. Chair Sisk asked if staff was
suggesting there is not any money for Disaster Recovery.
Terry Howerter replied in the affirmative. Chair Sisk inquired if
this outage was completely unforeseen by IT staff. Staff
does have a roadmap for maintenance and replacement. He
added that the server that went down was scheduled for
replacement in January. Chair Sisk asked if the funds to
replace the item will still come from the 2015 budget. Terry
Howerter replied that the funds budgeted for the replacement
will still come from the line item for January. He said it was a
“rob Peter to pay Paul” situation.
Director Lubow asked if the Unrestricted Fund would be the
most appropriate place to use for funding the IT Disaster
Recovery Enhancement. Terry Howerter said that as CFO, his
goal is to fund all three funds to $30 million as soon as
possible. He added that the sale of the land parcel was an
unbudgeted item. His suggestion is to use these funds.
Director Lubow asked if this item could be funded out of
Capital Acquisitions. Terry Howerter replied that it would be a
possibility if the Board desired to do that.
Director Solano said that when he first was elected as a
Director two years ago he recommended work on the IT
situation and was blown off. He stated his concern over the
“rob Peter to pay Paul” situation. He said that projects keep
getting shaved for other projects. He mentioned the dual line
project that was taken out of the budget for North Metro as an
example.
Committee Chair Walker asked how much is in the
Unrestricted fund. Terry Howerter said that 2015 year end
projection is $8.6 million. Committee Chair Walker asked if it
matter where the funds to cover the IT Disaster Recovery
Enhancement came from. Terry Howerter replied that it did
not matter as long as the Board approves the transfer of funds
from the funded accounts (the Capital Acquisitions and the
Board Restricted Fund).

Director Anderson asked what the Capital Acquisition Fund is
expected to be at 2015 year end. Terry Howerter replied that
it is projected at $15 million. Director Anderson noted that by
that time RTD will still be deciding on capital projects. She
said that it sounds like there is no free money anywhere.

Director Lasater said he consulted with his IT staff. From their
conversations he concluded that it will be expensive to put the
IT Disaster Recover Enhancements in place. However, the
best way to go about the problem is to outsource it to
professionals who do IT systems full time, professionally.
Director Lasater suggested migrating to Cloud Technology. He
said that it might be expensive but it would be less expensive
than RTD trying to do it ourselves.

B. Recommended Actions

• Englewood Art Shuttle
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that
the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to
execute all documents necessary to enter into a Cost Sharing Agreement
with the City of Englewood to provide RTD financial support for the
operation of the art circulator bus service in the City of Englewood. This
agreement is for calendar year 2015 and is for an amount not to exceed
$282,000.00.
Motion:

Director Folska made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the December 16, 2014
Board Meeting.
Director Walker seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations,
noted that staff views this action as a housekeeping item. He
explained in 2003 the City of Englewood (Englewood) applied
for and was awarded a Congestion Mitigation Air Quality
(CMAQ) grant to implement the Englewood Art Shuttle to
connect the medical complex to the light rail station. The
ridership through the three year period was far in excess of
what was anticipated. Bruce Abel commented that the CMAQ
grant expired in 2007, at which time RTD took over funding of
the art shuttle due to the high ridership. He stated that

Packet Pg. 42

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Dec 9, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Rivera-Malpiede was absent. Directors Anderson, Daly and Lasater left early.

6.E

Englewood wished to keep the shuttle free so they agreed to
contribute in an amount equal to the fares that would have
been collected. He pointed out that ridership continues to be
very, very good.

Director Bagley informed the Board that he used to represent a
portion of Englewood before the redistricting so he was very
familiar with the shuttle. He thinks this is a fantastic
opportunity to partner with the community. He stated that it
has been demonstrated that the ridership is extremely high.
Director Tobiassen said he agrees that this looks to be a very
successful partnership. He believes it is similar to the 16th
Street Mall Shuttle in providing the last mile connectivity.
Director Tobiassen wonders if any employers in the area offer
EcoPasses. Bruce Abel stated that there are; he does not have
the specific names readily available but will provide Director
Tobiassen with a list.
Director Deadwyler asked if the cost of operating the shuttle
was shared equally between RTD and Englewood. Bruce Abel
explained that RTD pays for the cost of operations while
Englewood compensates RTD for the revenue we forego by
maintaining the Shuttle as a free service. Director Deadwyler
inquired how much Englewood pays RTD for fares. Brian
Matthews, Manager of Special Services, said the revenue
would be about $70K for 2015.

Director James thanks this is a very good idea. The more RTD
collaborate with our colleagues in the metro area the better.
He noted that ideas and collaboration like this can be a great
way to address the first mile/last mile issue. He believes that
collaboration is growing with other cities and municipalities
because of examples like this.

6.E

C. Updates
Bruce Abel reminded the Board that when the Longmont Fare Buy Up was
first approved, the FTA had concerns about this being a fare change, which
would require a fare analysis. Due to this, the timeframe was scaled back to
a 6 month promotional period that could be extended an additional 18
months should Boulder County receive FTA approval for the entire period.
He noted that the FTA has since agreed this is not a fare change since
Boulder County and the City of Longmont (Longmont) are “buying up” the
fares. He said this means the program will now be in effect for the full 2
years.
Committee Chair Lubow inquired about how the program is performing.
Brian Matthews said that the Longmont buses are definitely carrying more
riders; however, he noted that it is important to determine if this is due to
more trips per existing rider or new riders. He explained that there have
been some specific questions added to the annual customer satisfaction
survey for the Longmont area to attempt to answer this question. Bruce
Abel pointed out that there was also an increase in riders during the six
months prior to the program taking effect, which has continued to grow in
the months following implementation. He said it is important to determine if
it is in fact the free fare driving up ridership or something that happened
prior.
Director Hoy highlighted Brian Matthews’ statement that at this time RTD
cannot determine if the increased ridership is due to new riders. He asked if
there would be anyway to pinpoint where the increased ridership was
coming from. Brian Matthews reiterated that hopefully those answers would
come from the additional questions that were added to the annual customer
satisfaction survey. He said staff hopes to have those results in spring of
2015.
Director Hoy wondered how the fares that Boulder County and Longmont
would pay RTD were calculated. Bruce Abel explained that the figure was
established from the farebox revenue in 2012. Boulder County and
Longmont agree to pay RTD that amount on an annualized basis in addition
to any increase in operational costs due to a need for additional service,
including costs for all Access-a-Ride trips. Director Hoy noted that between
August of 2013 and 2014 ridership has doubled, meaning RTD’s farebox
revenue would have also doubled. He asked if there was a provision for this
in the agreement. Bruce Abel stated that there was not a provision, just an
agreed upon dollar amount.

Chair Sisk shared that he recently heard Mayor Coombs speak very
positively about the cooperation and that this was a very successful venture
with RTD. He thought it was good to hear that this was a cooperative
venture. He believes that, similar to what RTD is doing with Englewood,
when we work with communities we can make the difference. Chair Sisk
thanked staff for their work on this program. He said that perhaps we are
leaving money on the table but all in all this is a very positive, revenue
neutral way for RTD to increase ridership.
Director Solano wonders if the Board approves this recommended action will
RTD be setting a trend for other municipalities to come to RTD and request
“buy ups”. Bruce Abel clarified that this is not a recommended action
because the Board approved the program previously; however, he hopes it
encourages other municipalities to work with RTD on a cooperative basis to
fund services.
Director Folska asked for additional information about the survey that Brain
Matthews alluded to earlier. She inquired how the surveys were
administered (i.e. via mail, telephone, on-board, etc. as well as if they were
conducted through a consultant).
She also wondered if perhaps it could
satisfy the FTA’s “Before and After” studies. Director Folska expressed that
there might be an overlap in RTD’s survey activities. Bruce Abel stated that
he would have Dennis Yaklich, Manager of Market Research, provide her
with further information.

 Fare Task Force Update (No Back-Up)
Lacy Bell, Planning Project Manager, reminded the Board that public outreach
meetings have begun. Staff hopes to have a recommendation on fare
structure to bring to the Board for approval next month. She reiterated that
the public is being presented with the following issues: (1) a simplified, four
fare structure of local, regional/express, rail and airport categories, and (2)
pay options of pay-per-boarding with a day pass option or pay-for-time (i.e.
pay for a three hour block in which the rider may take as many trips as they

Director Folska inquired if Access-a-Ride ridership had increased at a level
commensurate with bus ridership. Brian Matthews stated that he did not
have that data yet. He said for the first several months ridership remained
the same. He believes that word might not have gotten out yet that
Longmont is paying for Access-a-Ride trips if the origin is in Longmont.
Director Folska asked if that meant that all people with disabilities could use
all paratransit service for free. Bruce Abel explained that the program only
cover Access-a-Ride, not Access-a-Cab.

like). Lacy Bell explained that behind the scenes CH2M Hill is also modeling
RTD’s current fare structure as well as a one transfer alternative. She said
that the public input in conjunction with CH2M Hill’s continued research
would be used to come up with a recommendation.

Director Folska inquired what RTD is paying CH2M Hill. Lacy Bell stated
that the contract was for $220K.
Director Deadwyler asked Lacy Bell to review the types of service again.
She wonders how this will diminish the confusion surrounding the zones.
Lacy Bell stated that the types of service are local bus, regional/express bus,
rail service, and perhaps a surcharge on bus and rail for airport service.
Bruce Abel explained that this structure would eliminate the zones
referenced by Director Deadwyler. There would be a flat fare on the rail
system. He noted that the zones is where the most confusion was when
early outreach was done with customers. He also reminded the Board that
during the peer review RTD learned that almost all of the rail systems have
moved to a flat rate fare due to similar confusion to the customers.
Director Deadwyler expressed concern about having a surcharge for traveling
to the airport. She wonders if staff has considered that many of the people
that will be traveling to the airport are workers who make little more than
minimum wage. Bruce Abel explained that the way this will be addressed is
similar to what RTD does today; even though SkyRide is considered a
“premium” fare, anyone that holds a regional monthly pass can ride the
SkyRide. He said that as the employees would buy a monthly pass this
addresses the issue since the surcharge is applied to your occasional
traveler.
Committee Chair Lubow shared that at the meetings she attended there
were many comments that people felt it was unfair to pay more for rail than
the equivalent bus service. She asked how that would be dealt with if there
was just one rail fare. Bruce Abel explained that this will really be addressed
when the fare level is set, which is yet to be determined.

D. Other Matters
Director Menten wondered if there was any further information about the person
that was killed along the West line back in October. She inquired if perhaps the
wayside warning system might help prevent these types of fatalities in the future.
David Genova, Assistant General Manager of Safety, Security and Facilities, said

Lacy Bell shared that there is a video on RTD’s website in English and
Spanish which has received over 400 comments. She said that the three
meetings held thus far were moderately well attended. There are still three
more meetings that will be held.

6.E

General Manager Washington asked Marla Lien, General Counsel, to give an update
on the Colorado Cross Disability Coalition’s (CCDC) lawsuit related to light rail.
Marla Lien explained that the lawsuit appears to be very similar to the lawsuit
CCDC filed against RTD related to buses and keeping the wheelchair securement
areas open. She stated that it was filed in federal court but RTD has not yet been
served. CCDC has asked RTD to waive service; RTD has until December 31, 2014
to agree and then we will have 30 days to move to complaint.
Director Hoy asked why RTD would waive service. Marla Lien explained that if we
waive service we are afforded a 10 day bonus to move to complaint.
Director Folska said that it was her understanding that boarding from the high
blocks was also an issue in the complaint. She believes that the lawsuit is
requesting that only people with mobility devices be allowed to board from the high
blocks. She stated that the definition of a mobility device really needs to be
considered as the white cane used by visually impaired may not meet the definition.
Marla Lien stated that is why RTD would move to the complaint, not necessarily
answer it. There may be claims that we may dismiss, claims we may admit, and
claims we may deny. She said RTD is not conceding we would do everything they
ask.

that the Golden Policy Department is still waiting for the autopsy report to finalize
the investigation. He explained that based on video surveillance it appears that the
person entered RTD’s track area at an at-grade crossing. Austin Jenkins, Assistant
General Manager of Rail Operations, explained that the wayside warning system
would only be for RTD workers. As a train approaches an area in which people are
working, an alarm goes off in the cab as well as on the worker. He said this is just
an overlay of the numerous safety procedures already in place.

Chair Sisk thanked Brenden Morgan for providing the
explanation and clarity on the investment policy
changes. Paula Perdue stated the reason why the
unfinished business item on Investment Policy was
there is because it was tabled to a time certainty and
brought back to the Board. Director Walker asked for
clarity and stated his understanding this was tabled at a
committee meeting which does not apply to the Board
meeting. This item should be a part of the
recommended action agenda. Paula indicated she
would research and make the appropriate correction.
The committee would vote subject to this issue being
checked and validated.
Modified Motion:

The motion to approve the December Board meeting
was modified to state subject to the review of the
placement of the “Investment Policy” item on the
agenda.
The modified motion was seconded.

property and to see the re-purposing is worth seeing. This is a large facility which will
house not only LRT vehicles but commuter rail vehicles as well.
Director Bagley referred to the Squire Patton Boggs meeting where they stated the
House would be on recess during the APTA Legislative Conference. He suggested the
Executive Committee discuss if only a “light “ group of Board members should go and
schedule a more robust meeting when the full House is in session.
Director Hoy commented that he agrees in principle and understands the concerns;
however, he believes there will be a natural roll down in attendance based on decisions
by the respective Board members. Director Walker asked if it is possible to have an
audience here with our full Congressional Representatives.
Director Tobiassen stated that although the House would be in recess, there may be a
couple of opportunities to meet with key staff so it would not be a wasted meeting.
Another opportunity is when the Accelerate Colorado group goes to Washington. This
is a chance to educate the new representatives.
Chair Sisk shared he was of a mixed mind. On the one hand, it is unfortunate that the
House will be in recess. On the other hand, he sees this as a positive opportunity to
get to know the Board members on a more personal level. This is a chance to meet
Board members from other agencies. He is not comfortable with a mandate of what
others can do with their travel budget. He thinks this is a good opportunity for the
new Board members to go back. He thinks this should be individual decisions and for
the committee to make a call is overreaching in his opinion.
Director Bagley clarified he thought this was a conversation worth having, especially in
light of the information that the House would not be in session. He noted that last year
we had a very robust meeting. He was concerned that this year we may not.
Director Folska stated that in addition to meeting the staff, there are other committees
outside of our Congressional team that is beneficial to meet (i.e. T&I, Banking
Subcommittee, Energy, EPA)
Director Walker reflected that previous travels had not been as good as the one last
year. Perhaps we can put it on the next Government Relations Committee to discuss.
General Manager Washington commented that we need to remember that the
Conference in itself provides some wonderful speakers and sessions. APTA plans
these conferences years in advance and is reeling from the fact that the House will not
be in session. There are still some good things that can be gotten from this
conference.
Paula Perdue added there are a couple of things the Committee needs to take into
consideration about this Legislative conference: First, reservations are being made
now; these reservations fill up fast so a decision needs to be made. Secondly, it is
expected that a few RTD key people will be at this conference-General Manager
Washington, the APTA Board member Anderson and Director Walker to push the TBM
Conference in Denver in July. Thirdly, the weekend of the APTA Legislative
conference conflicts with the weekend for the joint Board-Staff Strategic Planning

General Manager Washington shared that the unveiling of the plaque at Rio Court was
a success. This plaque has the RTD Board members names listed on it. He shared
also that the Congressional FY 2015 budget is out and the $150M for the FFGA is on
the list. He stated the catchup funds are not on the list. Hopefully, this will be
approved this week.
General Manager Washington reported that the Leadership Academy graduation was
today. There are 29 graduates with families and friends. The graduation was held at
the Oxford Hotel.
Several of the Committee members reported on the Fare Task Force meeting. In
general, it was well attended and staff did a good job of keeping it focused. Chair Sisk
reported that the Boulder meeting was not well attended, perhaps due to the time of
day. There is a bicycle group there mobilizing who are concerned about the possibility
of an increase in fare.
Director Hoy made a general comment that he had attended an event at the St.
Anthony North-North Hospital. He reflected there has been tremendous growth in the
area around 136 North but transit services have not been extended. He thinks this is
phenomenal growth that perhaps RTD needs to get on our radar screen.

we need to confirm so she can get the 2015 calendar released. Chair Sisk asked if the
last week in February is an option and Paula responded there is no way she can turn
this around from the PEST workshop we will have on February 7. After some
discussions on possible times, the committee took a vote on which date for the Joint
Board-SLT Strategic planning advance:

Former Director William McMullen gave his support to the renewing of the

role in securing the FFGA for the Eagle project, thus freeing up dollars for I-225 and
North Metro.
Jay Corbett, Aurora, read a letter advocating for a ban on smoking on all rail
platforms in the state. A copy of the letter is available in the Board Minutes file in
the Board office.
Doug Gragg, Denver, suggested it was the working class who are the biggest
offenders on smoking and asked if we could just lay off. His specific issue was
about the fare study. He stated the fare study was not in touch with the working
class of riders who simply cannot afford the fare. We need to get rid of the zones.
They are too confusing, arbitrary and discriminatory.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: November 26, 2014

From:

Richard F. Clarke, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

November 26, 2014

Board Meeting Date: December 16, 2014

Subject:

Recommendation for Contract Award to Mass.
Electric Construction Company (MEC) for OnCall Systems Construction Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager to award a contract to Mass. Electric Construction Company (MEC), the
most qualified firm based on the application of the evaluation criteria, in the amount not to exceed
$67,229,300 for On-Call Systems Construction Services Contractor. The work in this Contract includes
providing new, retrofit, and emergency construction services for the Overhead Contact System, Traction
Power Systems, Fare Collection Systems, Signal and Communication System, and Trackwork
construction services. Funding for the contract award is included in the 2015 Adopted Capital Budget
for current year projects. Funding for future year projects will be authorized in future year budgets.
BACKGROUND
This action addresses the RTD 2014 goal of Innovative and Fiscally Sustainable Service Delivery and the
2015 goal of Improving Service Delivery. RTD has long employed on-call contractors to perform civil and
structural work on various projects. As RTD’s rail system has grown and with the complexity of
FasTracks, the need has arisen for an on-call systems construction services contract for electrical
systems. This is specialized work that can only be performed by specific contractors and is critical to
supporting Light Rail Operation.
In September 2014, RTD advertised a Request for Proposals for construction services for On-Call
Systems Construction work. On October 24, 2014, two written proposals were received:
1. Balfour Beatty Infrastructure Inc. (BBII)
2. Mass. Electric Construction Company (MEC)
The six RTD evaluation team members evaluated the written proposals and conducted a preliminary
ranking according to the following evaluation criteria:
A. Management, Organization, Experience and Approach………………..50%
B. Cost……………………………………………………………………………..35%
C. Commitment to and Substantive Utilization of Disadvantaged
and Small Businesses and WIN Program………………………………….15%
DISCUSSION
The ranking of the two proposals was very close as both firms have extensive experience and a good
track record with RTD. The following is the result of the evaluation by the six member evaluation team:
1. Mass. Electric Construction Company (MEC)
2. Balfour Beatty Infrastructure Inc. (BBII)

Packet Pg. 83

11.D

The team concluded that Mass. Electric Construction Company (MEC) was the recommended best value
contractor based on the following criteria:
A. Team Resources – The evaluation team believe Mass. Electric Construction Company (MEC)
demonstrated the ability to perform under the RFP, has the ability to fully support and provide
the necessary staff and equipment to fully implement the Scope of Work.
B. Project Management Approach – The evaluation team believe Mass. Electric Construction
Company (MEC) provided a strong project management approach including providing different
options for completing projects identified in the Scope of Work.
C. Schedule Performance and Approach – The evaluation team believe Mass. Electric
Construction Company (MEC) provided a thorough approach for schedule performance and
completion of projects. They demonstrated their ability, resources and capability to comply
with the Scope of Work.
In addition, Mass. Electric Construction Company’s (MEC) proposed DBE goal exceeded the 16% goal
advertised in the RFP and meets the 8% WIN goal. Therefore, the evaluation team recommends Mass.
Electric Construction Company (MEC) based on best value for RTD.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for the contract award is included in the 2015 Adopted Capital Budget for current year projects.
Funding for future year projects will be authorized in future year budgets.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee
that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to award a contract to Mass. Electric
Construction Company (MEC), the most qualified firm based on the application of the evaluation
criteria, in the amount not to exceed $67,229,300 for On-Call Systems Construction Services
Contractor. The work in this Contract includes providing new, retrofit, and emergency construction
services for the Overhead Contact System, Traction Power Systems, Fare Collection Systems, Signal
and Communication System, and Trackwork construction services. Funding for the contract award is
included in the 2015 Adopted Capital Budget for current year projects. Funding for future year
projects will be authorized in future year budgets.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to award a contract
to Mass. Electric Construction Company (MEC), the most qualified firm based on the application of
the evaluation criteria, in the amount not to exceed $67,229,300. This action is not recommended
because it will affect the capability to perform necessary State of Good Repair projects in a timely
manner on the current light-rail system. Also, the ability to quickly respond to critical systems
repairs on the light-rail system will be jeopardized.
3. Reject all submittals and reconsider the systems on-call construction services approach. This is not
recommended as experience has shown that an on-call services contract provides the highest quality
at the lowest price for these miscellaneous specialized projects. In addition, it provides immediate
response to any required emergency actions in the system area.

Subject:

Investment Policy

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
adopt the Investment Policy Statement (the “Policy”), attached.
BACKGROUND:
The Policy specifies the practices and procedures that pertain to the investment of RTD’s operating and
reserve funds. The Board last approved modifications to the Policy in September 2013. Section 10 of
the Policy states “The CFO shall conduct a review of the Policy on an annual basis and present the
policy, denoting any changes, to the Board of Directors for approval.”
DISCUSSION:
The purpose of the Investment Policy (the “Policy”) of the Regional Transportation District ("RTD") is to
specify the policies and procedures that support a prudent and systematic program for investments in
RTD’s operating and reserve funds. The Policy also provides for the investment of bond proceeds that
are authorized through bond resolutions or indentures of trust.
By following best practices with respect to the management of public funds, the primary objectives of
RTD’s Investment Policy in order of priority are: 1) safety of principal, 2) sufficient liquidity to meet
known cash flow requirements, and 3) yield (achieving a market rate of return). Although RTD must
legally follow the investment parameters dictated by Colorado Revised Statutes (C.R.S. 24-75-601.1) it
has previously made a policy decision to implement its investment program in a more conservative
manner than is dictated by state statute through imposing stricter diversification limits.
Staff solicited the expertise, knowledge and recommendations of its investment advisor in revising the
Policy. Changes being recommended are mainly in response to changes made to Colorado State
Statutes in 2014. Although some adjustments have been incorporated into the recommended Policy,
they do not significantly alter the intent of RTD’s current Policy.
The following table is a summary of the current 2014 Policy parameters compared to the recommended
Policy parameters. Items highlighted in yellow reflect changes being recommended to the Policy. The
Policy remains conservative in nature with the policy objectives remaining, in priority order, safety,
liquidity and yield and would still require stricter diversification limits than required by state statute.

The first recommended change reflected above is to the diversification requirements between issuers of
local government investment pools and money market funds. This change is a preemptive response to
the current money market reform efforts underway by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
The reforms being considered by the SEC that have been disclosed to date have the potential to reduce
the number of money market funds that exist today. Increasing the maximum issuer limit in the policy
from 20% to 50% provides RTD with flexibility to invest in a potentially smaller market of money market
and local government investment pools and enhances the ability of staff to manage daily cash
investments.
The second recommended change reflected above is to the maturity restrictions on municipal bonds.
State statute changes have allowed state and local governments the ability to invest in municipal bonds
that mature up to 5 years in the future instead of the previous 3 year limit. This recommended change
will increase the market of municipal bonds available for RTD to purchase. The policy still requires that
the portfolio be managed to maintain a duration of three years or less so a change to the existing
benchmarks is not being recommended at this time. Previously, the only securities that the policy
permitted beyond three years were U.S. Treasuries and Federal Agencies and Instrumentalities so this
third security type adds the ability diversify beyond U.S. Treasuries and Federal Agencies and
Instrumentalities in securities purchases with more than 3 year maturities while still limiting the whole
portfolio’s duration to three years or less.
The third recommended change reflected above is to minimum rating requirements of Federal Agencies
and Instrumentalities. State statute changes have allowed state and local governments the ability to
invest in Federal Agencies and Instrumentalities with ratings as low as AA-. This change in state statute
reflects the reality that many of these securities and issuers have been downgraded in recent years from
AAA to AA even though the securities are often guaranteed by the U.S. government. This Policy
change will increase the market of Federal Agency and Instrumentality securities available for RTD to
purchase.
The other change being recommended to ratings restrictions is reflective of changes made to State
statute which now differentiates between municipal bonds issued by Colorado municipal issuers and
non-Colorado issuers. State statute now allows local governments to invest in Colorado municipal issuer
bonds with a minimum rating of A- in contrast to non-Colorado municipal issuers who still require a

Packet Pg. 87

11.E

minimum rating of AA-. This change adds some flexibility to the management of RTD’s portfolio when
appropriate and again will increase the market of municipal bonds available for RTD to purchase.
Although these recommended changes allow for more flexibility in the management of RTD’s investment
portfolio, the Policy remains conservative in nature with the Policy objectives remaining, in priority order,
safety, liquidity and yield and would still require stricter diversification limits than required by state
statute.
Recommended changes are reflected in the attached redline copy of the RTD Investment Policy
Statement. A final version of the policy which includes all of the recommended changes is also
attached.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
The Policy presents no negative financial impacts to RTD.
ALTERNATIVES:
1. The Board may authorize the Investment Policy Statement (the “Policy”), attached. This is the
recommended alternative.
2. The Board may further revise the Policy.

Regional Transportation District ("RTD").
2. SCOPE
This investment policy ("Policy") applies to investment of all operating and reserve funds of the
RTD (collectively, the “Portfolio").
This Policy shall not restrict the ability of RTD to invest proceeds from the issuance of RTD
securities in financial obligations permitted through board-approved bond resolutions or
indentures of trust pursuant to which the securities were issued. The standards of care dictated
for investments of other RTD funds shall also pertain to the investment of such proceeds.
3. OBJECTIVES
The objectives, in priority order, of the RTD's investment activities shall be:
3.1 Safety
Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the investment program. Investments of RTD
will be made in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the Portfolio. To
attain this objective, RTD will endeavor to mitigate credit and interest rate risks.
Credit Risk: RTD will minimize credit risk, which is the risk of loss due to the failure of the
security issuer or backer, by:



Limiting investments to the types of securities listed in the Authorized Investments
section of this Policy.
Diversifying the Portfolio in accordance with Policy limits in order to minimize the
potential for losses from any one type of security or any one individual issuer.

Interest Rate Risk: RTD will minimize interest rate risk, which is the risk that the market
value of securities in the Portfolio will fall due to changes in market interest rates, by:


Maintaining Portfolio duration appropriate to the cash flow requirements of RTD,
thereby reducing the likelihood that securities would need to be sold on the open
market prior to maturity.

11.E.a

3.2 Liquidity
The Portfolio will remain sufficiently liquid to enable RTD to meet all cash flow requirements
which might be reasonably anticipated. This will be achieved through maturity diversification
and purchases of securities that have an established secondary market.
3.3 Yield

Attachment: Investment Policy Markup (2151 : Investment Policy)

The Portfolio shall be designed with the objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout
budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account the investment risk constraints, liquidity
needs, and cash flow characteristics of the Portfolio.
4. STANDARDS OF CARE
4.1 Prudence
All RTD officers and employees involved in the investment of RTD funds, along with any
external investment advisors, shall adhere to the guidance provided by the “prudent investor”
standard to insure that:
“When investing, reinvesting, purchasing, acquiring, exchanging, selling, or managing
public funds, a trustee shall act with care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the
circumstances then prevailing, including, but not limited to, the general economic
conditions and the anticipated needs of the agency, that a prudent person acting in a like
capacity and familiar with those matters would use in the conduct of funds of a like
character and with like aims, to safeguard the principal and maintain the liquidity needs
of the agency. Within the limitations of this section and considering individual
investments as part of an overall strategy, investments may be acquired as authorized by
law."
RTD shall recognize that no investment is totally riskless and that the investment activities of
RTD are a matter of public record. Accordingly, it recognizes that occasional measured losses
are inevitable in a diversified portfolio and shall be considered within the context of the overall
Portfolio’s return, provided that adequate diversification has been implemented, and that the sale
of a security is in the best long-term interest of RTD.

Formatted: Left

Authorized investment personnel acting in accordance with this Policy and exercising due
diligence shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security’s credit risk or
market price changes, provided that deviations from expectation are reported in a timely fashion
and appropriate action is taken to control adverse developments.

4.2 Delegation of Authority
RTD is granted legislative authority to invest its funds pursuant to Colorado Revised Statutes,
Section 32-9-119. Management responsibility for the investment program is hereby delegated to
the General Manager and his designees. The General Manager’s designee will hereinafter be
referred to as the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”).

Formatted: Left

Attachment: Investment Policy Markup (2151 : Investment Policy)

RTD may, in its discretion, contract with one or more investment advisers, registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, to manage a
portion of its Portfolio assets. Any such advisor shall comply with this Policy and such other
written instructions as provided by RTD.
While it is understood that the procedures and trading counterparties of a contracted investment
adviser may differ from those of RTD, contracted investment advisers must maintain internal
controls and compliance systems at least as extensive as those of the RTD in order to assure
adequate protection of RTD assets in keeping with the standards of prudence outlined below.
4.3 Investment Procedures
The CFO shall establish written procedures for the operation of the investment program,
consistent with this Policy, which shall include explicit delegation of authority to persons
responsible for investment transactions. No person may engage in an investment transaction
except as provided under the terms of this Policy and the internal procedures established by the
CFO. Persons who are authorized to transact investment business and wire funds on behalf of
RTD are listed in Appendix 1 to this policy.
4.4 Internal Controls
The CFO shall establish a system of internal controls, which shall be reviewed annually. The
controls shall be designed to prevent loss of funds due to fraud, employee error,
misrepresentation by third parties, or imprudent actions by employees of RTD.

Formatted: Left

4.5 Ethics and Conflicts of Interest
Investment activities shall be performed in accordance with RTD’s Code of Ethics and other
policies of RTD. Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from
personal business activity that could conflict with the proper execution of the investment
program, or which could impair their ability to make impartial investment decisions. Employees
and investment officials shall disclose to the General Manager any material financial interests in
financial institutions that conduct business with RTD, and they shall further disclose any large
personal/financial/investment positions that could be related to the performance of the Portfolio.
Employees and officers shall subordinate their personal investment transactions to those of RTD
particularly with regard to the timing of purchases or sales.

5. AUTHORIZED INVESTMENTS
Authorized investments for RTD funds are specifically listed below. RTD recognizes that
investment risk can result from issuer defaults, market price changes or various technical
impediments leading to diminished liquidity or loss of capital. Portfolio risk management and
diversification are employed as a way to minimize the risks inherent in investing.

Attachment: Investment Policy Markup (2151 : Investment Policy)

organizations (“NRSROs”) include intermediate rating categories. For example, the second
highest rating category (“AA”) will includes bonds rated AA+, AA and AA- for Standard &
Poor's and Fitch, and Aa1, Aa2 and Aa3 for Moody's Investors Service. In the event that an
issuer or security is downgraded below the minimum rating level for any specific security that is
held in the Portfolio, the CFO will review the exposure of that security holding and will
determine if it is advisable to sell such holding.
Maturity Restrictions: Maturity restrictions shall be calculated from settlement date to maturity
date. Portfolio percentage restrictions by security type and issuer are applicable only on the date
of purchase of the investment.

6. INVESTMENT PARAMETERS
6.1 Sale of Securities

Attachment: Investment Policy Markup (2151 : Investment Policy)

RTD does not make investments for the purpose of trading or speculation, but, rather, with the
prevalent intent to hold securities to maturity. The prohibition of speculative investment
precludes pursuit of profit through unusual risk or conjectural fluctuations in market prices.
However, fluctuations in market rates or changes in credit quality may produce situations where
securities may be sold at a nominal loss in order to mitigate further erosion of principal or to
reinvest proceeds of sale in securities that will out-perform the original investment.

6.2 Competitive Bidding
A record shall be maintained of all bids and offers for securities transactions to support RTD’s
competitive pricing process. Relative offerings shall not be required in the purchase of
obligations at their initial auction or offering. Typically, awards will be made to the bidder
offering the highest effective yield consistent with the Policy: however, transaction costs,
diversification requirements, extraordinary events and other factors may be considered when
awarding investments.
6.3 Portfolio Duration
The maturity of the securities in the Portfolio shall be managed with respect to the cash flow
needs of RTD and the Portfolio shall be managed to maintain a duration of three years or less.
6.4 Authorized Financial Dealers and Institutions
RTD will maintain a list of financial institutions authorized to provide investment services and it
shall be the policy of RTD to purchase securities only from those authorized institutions and
firms. Trading counterparties shall be limited to (i) primary dealers reporting to the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York, or (ii) broker/dealers that qualify under Securities and Exchange
Commission Rule 15c3-1 (uniform net capital rule).
6.5 Authorized Investment Advisors
RTD may engage the services of one or more professional investment advisory firms to assist in
the management of the Portfolio. Such investment advisors may be granted discretion to
purchase and sell investment securities in accordance with this Policy and may utilize their own
approved list of broker/dealers. Such firms must be authorized to conduct business in the State
of Colorado and shall be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

7. SAFEKEEPING AND CUSTODY

With the exception of collateral under repurchase agreements (discussed below), all investment
securities purchased shall be held in a safekeeping account or trust custody account at a
designated third party custodian. For safekeeping accounts, the institution shall issue a
safekeeping receipt for each security, listing the specific instrument, par value, rate, CUSIP and
any other pertinent information. In addition, the safekeeping or trust custody institutions shall
provide a statement on at least a monthly basis listing all securities held in account, including
book value and market value of holdings at month month-end.
For collateral (purchased securities) under repurchase agreements, RTD may utilize tri-party
repurchase agreements with an acceptable third-party custodian provided that RTD is satisfied
that it has perfected interest in the securities used as collateral, and that RTD has a properly
executed tri-party agreement.
7.2 Delivery vs. Payment
All investment transactions will be executed on a delivery versus payment basis.
8. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
Investment reports shall be prepared on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis. Transaction
summaries shall be maintained and available in the office of the CFO or other authorized
investment personnel. Quarterly investment reports shall be submitted to the Board of Directors
and shall outline RTD’s total investment return and compare the Portfolio’s performance to a
publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics.

Formatted: Left

Within 120 days of the end of RTD’s fiscal year, a comprehensive report on RTD’s investment
program and investment activity shall be prepared for the Board of Directors. The annual report
shall include quarterly comparisons of investment return and may suggest improvements that
might be made in the investment program. Such annual report shall include any other item of
significance which may enhance the understanding of the investment program. Each investment
advisor shall submit like reports in a timely manner based on the respective terms of each
contract and agreement
All securities holdings reports for RTD shall disclose the maximum maturity liability to RTD
(the stated maturity) as well as the first call date of each callable security held.

9. PERFORMANCE STANDARDS

The current board-approved index for the liquidity tier of the Portfolio (cash and cash
equivalents) is the 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index as published by Bank of America Merrill
Lynch. For the enhanced cash portion of the Portfolio (securities maturing between 90 days and
5 years and with a target duration of 1 year), the designated performance benchmark is the
Merrill Lynch 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.
RTD recognizes that bond proceeds must be invested in accordance with Section 1.148 of the
U.S. Internal Revenue Code, related to arbitrage rebate, which limits the investment returns
which may be achieved or retained by RTD on such proceeds investments. For purposes of this
Policy “bond proceeds” shall mean proceeds from the issuance of bonds, certificates of
participation or other financial securities issued by RTD.
10. INVESTMENT POLICY REVIEW AND APPROVAL
The CFO shall conduct a review of the Policy on an annual basis and present the Policy,
denoting any changes, to the Board of Directors for approval.

Attachment: Investment Policy Markup (2151 : Investment Policy)

RTD's Portfolio is managed with the objective of obtaining a market rate of return,
commensurate with identified risk constraints and cash flow characteristics. Because the
composition of the Portfolio fluctuates, depending on market and credit conditions, various
indices may be used to monitor investment performance.

Regional Transportation District
Investment Policy Statement
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this document is to specify the policies and procedures that support a prudent and
systematic program for investment transactions involving operating and reserve funds of the
Regional Transportation District ("RTD").

This investment policy ("Policy") applies to investment of all operating and reserve funds of the
RTD (collectively, the “Portfolio").
This Policy shall not restrict the ability of RTD to invest proceeds from the issuance of RTD
securities in financial obligations permitted through board-approved bond resolutions or
indentures of trust pursuant to which the securities were issued. The standards of care dictated
for investments of other RTD funds shall also pertain to the investment of such proceeds.
3. OBJECTIVES
The objectives, in priority order, of the RTD's investment activities shall be:
3.1 Safety
Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the investment program. Investments of RTD
will be made in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the Portfolio. To
attain this objective, RTD will endeavor to mitigate credit and interest rate risks.
Credit Risk: RTD will minimize credit risk, which is the risk of loss due to the failure of the
security issuer or backer, by:



Limiting investments to the types of securities listed in the Authorized Investments
section of this Policy.
Diversifying the Portfolio in accordance with Policy limits in order to minimize the
potential for losses from any one type of security or any one individual issuer.

Attachment: Investment Policy Final (2151 : Investment Policy)

2. SCOPE

Interest Rate Risk: RTD will minimize interest rate risk, which is the risk that the market
value of securities in the Portfolio will fall due to changes in market interest rates, by:


Maintaining Portfolio duration appropriate to the cash flow requirements of RTD,
thereby reducing the likelihood that securities would need to be sold on the open
market prior to maturity.

Packet Pg. 108

11.E.b

3.2 Liquidity
The Portfolio will remain sufficiently liquid to enable RTD to meet all cash flow requirements
which might be reasonably anticipated. This will be achieved through maturity diversification
and purchases of securities that have an established secondary market.
3.3 Yield

4. STANDARDS OF CARE
4.1 Prudence
All RTD officers and employees involved in the investment of RTD funds, along with any
external investment advisors, shall adhere to the guidance provided by the “prudent investor”
standard to insure that:
“When investing, reinvesting, purchasing, acquiring, exchanging, selling, or managing
public funds, a trustee shall act with care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the
circumstances then prevailing, including, but not limited to, the general economic
conditions and the anticipated needs of the agency, that a prudent person acting in a like
capacity and familiar with those matters would use in the conduct of funds of a like
character and with like aims, to safeguard the principal and maintain the liquidity needs
of the agency. Within the limitations of this section and considering individual
investments as part of an overall strategy, investments may be acquired as authorized by
law."
RTD shall recognize that no investment is totally riskless and that the investment activities of
RTD are a matter of public record. Accordingly, it recognizes that occasional measured losses
are inevitable in a diversified portfolio and shall be considered within the context of the overall
Portfolio’s return, provided that adequate diversification has been implemented, and that the sale
of a security is in the best long-term interest of RTD.

Attachment: Investment Policy Final (2151 : Investment Policy)

The Portfolio shall be designed with the objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout
budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account the investment risk constraints, liquidity
needs, and cash flow characteristics of the Portfolio.

Authorized investment personnel acting in accordance with this Policy and exercising due
diligence shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security’s credit risk or
market price changes, provided that deviations from expectation are reported in a timely fashion
and appropriate action is taken to control adverse developments.
4.2 Delegation of Authority
RTD is granted legislative authority to invest its funds pursuant to Colorado Revised Statutes,
Section 32-9-119. Management responsibility for the investment program is hereby delegated to

2
Packet Pg. 109

11.E.b

the General Manager and his designees. The General Manager’s designee will hereinafter be
referred to as the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”).
RTD may, in its discretion, contract with one or more investment advisers, registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, to manage a
portion of its Portfolio assets. Any such advisor shall comply with this Policy and such other
written instructions as provided by RTD.

4.3 Investment Procedures
The CFO shall establish written procedures for the operation of the investment program,
consistent with this Policy, which shall include explicit delegation of authority to persons
responsible for investment transactions. No person may engage in an investment transaction
except as provided under the terms of this Policy and the internal procedures established by the
CFO. Persons who are authorized to transact investment business and wire funds on behalf of

6. INVESTMENT PARAMETERS
6.1 Sale of Securities
RTD does not make investments for the purpose of trading or speculation, but, rather, with the
prevalent intent to hold securities to maturity. The prohibition of speculative investment
precludes pursuit of profit through unusual risk or conjectural fluctuations in market prices.
However, fluctuations in market rates or changes in credit quality may produce situations where
securities may be sold at a nominal loss in order to mitigate further erosion of principal or to
reinvest proceeds of sale in securities that will out-perform the original investment.

A record shall be maintained of all bids and offers for securities transactions to support RTD’s
competitive pricing process. Relative offerings shall not be required in the purchase of
obligations at their initial auction or offering. Typically, awards will be made to the bidder
offering the highest effective yield consistent with the Policy: however, transaction costs,
diversification requirements, extraordinary events and other factors may be considered when
awarding investments.
6.3 Portfolio Duration
The maturity of the securities in the Portfolio shall be managed with respect to the cash flow
needs of RTD and the Portfolio shall be managed to maintain a duration of three years or less.
6.4 Authorized Financial Dealers and Institutions
RTD will maintain a list of financial institutions authorized to provide investment services and it
shall be the policy of RTD to purchase securities only from those authorized institutions and
firms. Trading counterparties shall be limited to (i) primary dealers reporting to the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York, or (ii) broker/dealers that qualify under Securities and Exchange
Commission Rule 15c3-1 (uniform net capital rule).
6.5 Authorized Investment Advisors
RTD may engage the services of one or more professional investment advisory firms to assist in
the management of the Portfolio. Such investment advisors may be granted discretion to
purchase and sell investment securities in accordance with this Policy and may utilize their own
approved list of broker/dealers. Such firms must be authorized to conduct business in the State
of Colorado and shall be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

7. SAFEKEEPING AND CUSTODY
7.1 Safekeeping and custody

For collateral (purchased securities) under repurchase agreements, RTD may utilize tri-party
repurchase agreements with an acceptable third-party custodian provided that RTD is satisfied
that it has perfected interest in the securities used as collateral, and that RTD has a properly
executed tri-party agreement.
7.2 Delivery vs. Payment
All investment transactions will be executed on a delivery versus payment basis.
8. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
Investment reports shall be prepared on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis. Transaction
summaries shall be maintained and available in the office of the CFO or other authorized
investment personnel. Quarterly investment reports shall be submitted to the Board of Directors
and shall outline RTD’s total investment return and compare the Portfolio’s performance to a
publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics.
Within 120 days of the end of RTD’s fiscal year, a comprehensive report on RTD’s investment
program and investment activity shall be prepared for the Board of Directors. The annual report
shall include quarterly comparisons of investment return and may suggest improvements that
might be made in the investment program. Such annual report shall include any other item of
significance which may enhance the understanding of the investment program. Each investment
advisor shall submit like reports in a timely manner based on the respective terms of each
contract and agreement

Attachment: Investment Policy Final (2151 : Investment Policy)

With the exception of collateral under repurchase agreements (discussed below), all investment
securities purchased shall be held in a safekeeping account or trust custody account at a
designated third party custodian. For safekeeping accounts, the institution shall issue a
safekeeping receipt for each security, listing the specific instrument, par value, rate, CUSIP and
any other pertinent information. In addition, the safekeeping or trust custody institutions shall
provide a statement on at least a monthly basis listing all securities held in account, including
book value and market value of holdings at month-end.

All securities holdings reports for RTD shall disclose the maximum maturity liability to RTD
(the stated maturity) as well as the first call date of each callable security held.
9. PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
RTD's Portfolio is managed with the objective of obtaining a market rate of return,
commensurate with identified risk constraints and cash flow characteristics. Because the
composition of the Portfolio fluctuates, depending on market and credit conditions, various
indices may be used to monitor investment performance.
8
Packet Pg. 115

11.E.b

The current board-approved index for the liquidity tier of the Portfolio (cash and cash
equivalents) is the 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index as published by Bank of America Merrill
Lynch. For the enhanced cash portion of the Portfolio (securities maturing between 90 days and
5 years and with a target duration of 1 year), the designated performance benchmark is the
Merrill Lynch 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.

10. INVESTMENT POLICY REVIEW AND APPROVAL
The CFO shall conduct a review of the Policy on an annual basis and present the Policy,
denoting any changes, to the Board of Directors for approval.

Attachment: Investment Policy Final (2151 : Investment Policy)

RTD recognizes that bond proceeds must be invested in accordance with Section 1.148 of the
U.S. Internal Revenue Code, related to arbitrage rebate, which limits the investment returns
which may be achieved or retained by RTD on such proceeds investments. For purposes of this
Policy “bond proceeds” shall mean proceeds from the issuance of bonds, certificates of
participation or other financial securities issued by RTD.

Regional Transportation District

Investment Policy Statement
1. PURPOSE

systematic program for investment transactions involving operating and reserve funds of the
Regional Transportation District(" RTD").
2. SCOPE

This investment policy(" Policy") applies to investment of all operating and reserve funds of the
RTD( collectively, the" Portfolio").
This Policy shall not restrict the ability of RTD to invest proceeds from the issuance of RTD
securities in financial obligations permitted through board- approved bond resolutions or
indentures of trust pursuant to which the securities were issued. The standards of care dictated
for investments of other RTD funds shall also pertain to the investment of such proceeds.
3. OBJECTIVES

The objectives, in priority order, of the RTD' s investment activities shall be:
3. 1 Safety

Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the investment program. Investments of RTD
will be made in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the Portfolio. To
attain this objective, RTD will endeavor to mitigate credit and interest rate risks.
Credit Risk: RTD will minimize credit risk, which is the risk of loss due to the failure of the

security issuer or backer, by:
Limiting investments to the types of securities listed in the Authorized Investments
section of this Policy.
Diversifying the Portfolio in accordance with Policy limits in order to minimize the

potential for losses from any one type of security or any one individual issuer.

Attachment: 2014 Resolution - 015 Investment Policy Statement (2151 : Investment Policy)

The purpose of this document is to specify the policies and procedures that support a prudent and

Interest Rate Risk: RTD will minimize interest rate risk, which is the risk that the market

value of securities in the Portfolio will fall due to changes in market interest rates, by:
Maintaining Portfolio duration appropriate to the cash flow requirements of RTD,
thereby reducing the likelihood that securities would need to be sold on the open
market prior to maturity.

1

Packet Pg. 122

11.E.c

3. 2 Liquidity

The Portfolio will remain sufficiently liquid to enable RTD to meet all cash flow requirements

which might be reasonably anticipated. This will be achieved through maturity diversification
and purchases of securities that have an established secondary market.

The Portfolio shall be designed with the objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout

budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account the investment risk constraints, liquidity
needs, and cash flow characteristics of the Portfolio.
4. STANDARDS OF CARE
4. 1 Prudence

All RTD officers and employees involved in the investment of RTD funds, along with any
external investment advisors, shall adhere to the guidance provided by the" prudent investor"
standard to insure that:

When investing, reinvesting, purchasing, acquiring, exchanging, selling, or managing
public funds, a trustee shall act with care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the

circumstances then prevailing, including, but not limited to, the general economic
conditions and the anticipated needs of the agency, that a prudent person acting in a like
capacity and familiar with those matters would use in the conduct of funds of a like
character and with like aims, to safeguard the principal and maintain the liquidity needs
of the agency. Within the limitations of this section and considering individual

investments as part of an overall strategy, investments may be acquired as authorized by
law."

RTD shall recognize that no investment is totally riskless and that the investment activities of
RTD are a matter of public record. Accordingly, it recognizes that occasional measured losses
are inevitable in a diversified portfolio and shall be considered within the context of the overall
Portfolio' s return, provided that adequate diversification has been implemented, and that the sale

of a security is in the best long-term interest of RTD.
Authorized investment personnel acting in accordance with this Policy and exercising due
diligence shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security' s credit risk or
market price changes, provided that deviations from expectation are reported in a timely fashion

Approval of On-to-Off and Onboard Passenger
Surveys Consultant Selection

Date: November 25, 2014
General

GM
Board Meeting Date: December 16, 2014

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager to execute all documents necessary to award a contract to ETC Institute for
the completion of an on-to-off and onboard passenger surveys project for an amount not to exceed
$1,435,000. Funding is included in the FasTracks 2015 budget.
BACKGROUND
This action supports and fulfills the General Manager Goals of Grow riders and engage customers
across the region because it will collect relevant data for the understanding of RTD passengers; and
Continue advancement of FasTracks because it moves RTD further toward completion of the full
FasTracks Plan.
The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) requires recipients of Full Funding Grant Agreements
(FFGAs) to complete “Before and After” studies and regularly update travel forecasting models for
the projects receiving grants. On-to-off and onboard passenger surveys collect important data for
understanding the context in which RTD passengers make their travel decisions. The data from these
surveys will be used in the development of the required “Before and After” studies of the West Rail
Line and Eagle project and for travel model updates used to develop RTD ridership forecasts.
DISCUSSION
The Civil Rights Division set a Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) goal of 15% of the contract
value and a Workforce Initiative Now (WIN) requirement of 20% of the personnel. Four teams submitted
proposals. The prime contractors were Dikita, ETC Institute, NuStats, and OGx. The evaluation team
consisted of four RTD staff members and one staff member from the Denver Regional Council of
Governments (DRCOG). ETC Institute is committed to meeting the DBE goal and WIN requirement.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for this project will come from a combination of local FasTracks funds from the West Rail
Line and a mix of federal and local FasTracks funds from the Eagle Project. Funding is included in
the FasTracks 2015 budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee
that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to execute all documents
necessary to award a contract to ETC Institute for the completion of an on-to-off and onboard
passenger surveys project for an amount not to exceed $1,435,000. Funding is included in
the FasTracks 2015 budget.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. This is not recommended because it would violate

Approval of 2015 Final Performance Measures

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
adopts the 2015 Final Performance Measures proposed recommendations for Goals 3.1, 6.2, and 6.3.
The final recommendations for these goals are made after the 2015 Budget is adopted in November to
reflect budget estimates.
POLICY REFERENCE
Fiscal Policy Statements – Budget Policy 10
BACKGROUND
Each year the RTD Board of Directors adopts a vision and mission statement, goals, objectives, and
specific performance measures. These measures provide a framework in which RTD can determine
how well it provides service to its passengers and the citizens of the District. A report detailing yearto-date performance on each of these measures is presented to the Board of Directors following the
end of each quarter.
In April 2014, the Board adopted the 2015 performance measures for all goals except 3.1, 6.2, and
6.3. These three goals are finalized after the 2015 Budget is adopted in November because these
goals are contingent upon budgeted amounts and available resources.
DISCUSSION
Recommended changes to Goals 3.1, 6.2, and 6.3 from 2014 to 2015 are listed below:


Goal 3.1 Maintain system-wide on-time performance (bus)
o No changes are recommended to the bus on-time performance goals in 2015 and they
remain the same as in 2014 as follows:



Goal 6.2 Increase ridership
o This measure is proposed based on the 2015 Budget and Ridership Goal Model as
adopted by the Board of Directors. The forecast is for ridership to remain flat in 2015.

Packet Pg. 141

12.H



Goal 6.3 Increase in fare revenue and total revenue
o This measure is proposed based on the 2015 Budget as adopted by the Board of
Directors. The decline in fare revenue comes from an estimated decline in West Line
farebox revenues of $1.6 million in 2015 per the FasTracks Annual Program Evaluation
and a small decline of $0.325 million in other operating revenue.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
No additional financial impact results from the adoption of these final performance measures apart
from the 2015 Adopted Budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Adopt the 2015 Final Performance Measures to include specific measurements for the three
goals described above.
2. Modify the 2015 Final Performance Measures for the three goals described above. This would
not conform with the 2015 Adopted Budget as approved by Board of Directors in November
2014.
3. Do not adopt the 2015 Final Performance Measures to include specific measurements for the
three goals described above and do not measure performance against these goals in 2015.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: December 4, 2014

From:

Marla Lien, General Counsel
Terry Howerter, Chief Financial Officer

GM

Date:

December 3, 2014

Board Meeting Date: December 16, 2014

Subject:

Recommendation for Passage of Resolution
Regarding Defense of RTD Management
Trustees Appointed to RTD/ ATU 1001
Trusts

Resolution
RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors pass
the attached resolution authorizing retention of defense counsel and payment of all defense costs, and
procurement of insurance if available for management trustees appointed to the RTD/ATU 1001 Health
and Welfare and Pension Trusts, without reservation of rights of recovery of such costs regardless of
any determination of liability, to the extent such defense costs are not covered by the trusts or their
insurers.
BACKGROUND
The Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) between RTD and the ATU 1001 provides that RTD will pay
health and welfare and retirement benefits into two separate trusts, the RTD/ATU 1001 Health and
Welfare Trust and the RTD/ATU 1001 Pension Trust, and that each trust will be administered by three
management appointed and three ATU appointed trustees. Therefore, RTD currently has a contractual
obligation to appoint trustees. When acting as trustees, RTD appointees are serving as fiduciaries.
Some case law has indicated that even when appointed by RTD, fiduciaries must act independently and
are not considered to be in the course and scope of their employment when fulfilling their roles as
Trustees. If claims are made against RTD appointed trustees for their acts taken while serving in that
capacity RTD may not be responsible for defending them. The trusts have indemnification provisions and
have insurance, however both the provisions on indemnifying for costs of defense, and the insurance,
exclude claims for certain breaches of fiduciary of duty and willful misconduct. Claims may allege either
or both leaving trustees potentially personally at risk for their defense.
DISCUSSION
For so long as RTD is required to appoint trustees under the CBA, it is in RTD’s best interests to appoint
capable trustees who would not need to refuse the positons out of fear of personal exposure. To the
extent the Trust Agreements and insurance policies do not cover costs of defense it is recommended
that RTD agree to provide defense for RTD appointed trustees regardless of the outcome of the matter,
where such costs are not covered by the Trusts or the Trusts insurers. RTD may procure insurance
coverage for its trustees to the extent such coverage is available and has not been procured by the ATU
trusts. This does not include payment of judgments against any trustee.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The financial impact is unknown. RTD could pay defenses costs only if claims were made against
management trustees, such claims were not covered by the trusts or the trusts insurers, and RTD was
not able to procure insurance for those claims.
ALTERNATIVES
1.
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors pass the attached resolution authorizing retention of defense counsel and payment of all
defense costs, and procurement of insurance if available for management trustees appointed to the
RTD/ATU 1001 Health and Welfare and Pension Trusts, without reservation of rights of recovery of such
costs regardless of any determination of liability, to the extent such defense costs are not covered by
the trusts or their insurers.
2.
Do not pass the attached resolution and do not agree to provide costs of defense for claims
against management trustees. This may be a disincentive for RTD employees to accept that
appointment.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: December 4, 2014

From:

Terry L. Howerter, Chief Financial Officer

GM

Date:

December 4, 2014

Board Meeting Date: December 16, 2014

Subject:

Enhance IT Disaster Recovery Capabilities

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorizes the General Manager to take all necessary actions and to execute all documents necessary to
partially fund Information Technology’s Disaster Recovery (DR) infrastructure and systems. This is an
amount of approximately $1.2 million.
BACKGROUND
As a common Information Technology (IT) industry practice, many of RTD’s computer systems and
applications use centralized data storage. In November, a key hardware element on the primary
centralized storage device failed, leaving several of the virtual servers hosted by this device and the
services and applications that they hosted inaccessible. Ultimately it was determined that the failed
components of the original storage device were unrecoverable. IT directed all available resources to the
configuration of secondary storage devices. Over three-days, data and services were restored in order of
priority as communicated by the affected business units. In these three days that included the weekend;
over 900 hours of IT staff time was directed to this recovery and diverted from their regular duties.
The storage device in question did have extensive built-in redundancy to account for potential failures.
As part of our ongoing review and technology roadmap plans, the device was planned to be replaced in
early 2015. The particular component of the device that failed prevented the device from responding to
a disk error, which propagated corrupted data across multiple disks, and led to the full failure of a
section of the device.
No operational data was lost during this event.
 All service and application data that resided on the failed storage device was backed up routinely.
IT was able to restore this data to another storage device.
 Despite the breadth of the outage and the impact to business processes, IT confirmed that critical
security systems, centralized dispatch systems, control systems / SCADA remained operational.
Well prior to this failure, IT actively took steps to document a technology roadmap for standard
maintenance activities including upgrades and replacements. IT further requested funding to support the
roadmap through the Strategic Budgeting Process. There is an additional amount of work required to
bring all of IT’s equipment current and we have been working through a prioritized list to deploy the
necessary maintenance and upgrades given existing staff and resources.
Where our recovery plans for such an event are concerned, our efforts are focused on data recovery and
we are now addressing maintaining seamless continuation of operations. IT regularly prepares data
backups of all of RTD systems so that RTD can reestablish services in the case of a system or storage
failure. Some steps have already been taken regarding disaster recovery, including establishing a
secondary recovery site at the State of Colorado’s EFOR3T facility. A business impact analysis
conducted in 2013 concluded that the first system to be replicated at the disaster recovery site would
be Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD). The CAD elements are presently in acceptance testing.

12.J

Additionally, in 2015, IT is undertaking a cloud services study that will assess the benefits and
drawbacks of hosting email, performing critical system backups, and performing other functions using a
cloud-based third-party service provider. This could eliminate the need for RTD to provide independent
disaster recovery for business systems hosted by the third party if the third party were obligated to
provide the necessary redundancy and disaster recovery features. This will not eliminate the need for
redundancy or disaster recovery in key critical systems that will remain in the RTD-hosted environment.
Ideally, there would be a fully redundant system for critical business processes where failover to a
redundant system would occur when a major outage is experienced. This is a substantial investment and
budget for such a disaster recovery system has yet to be identified. The funds from this proposed action
will be directed towards providing necessary foundational redundancy for critical systems in order of
priority.
DISCUSSION
On November 16, 2012 the Board approved a Staff recommendation to establish the FasTracks Internal
Savings Account (FISA). A component of the funding sources was identified as the sale or lease of all
RTD properties and it was agreed the funds from these sales and leases would be deposited in the FISA
account. Further there would be no distinction between Base and FasTracks sales or leases. Staff
recognizes the importance of funding the FISA, but due to limited resources and budget constraints
would recommend that the funds from the Alameda and Havana Park ‘n Ride property sale,
approximately $1.2 million, be allocated towards foundational Disaster Recovery hardware addressing
the need for additional servers, storage, firewalls, network connectivity and site backup/restore capacity.
Historically, these types of non-recurring infrequent revenue sources have been used to fund needed one
time projects. This is approximately $926,000 for hardware, initial licensing of $64,000 and an
additional $210,000 for consultant deployment services of an estimate 1,396 hours.
The deployment will require approximately six months to establish the necessary foundational
components, configure, test and move key elements of these critical services into operations.
Subsequently additional less priority applications and systems will be added to the service.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The development of DR resources is a necessary risk management foundational step and will need to be
accomplished as soon as practical. The sale of the Alameda property will generate approximately $1.2
milIion that could be used for establishing the foundation for the DR facility and procuring necessary
hardware. Future cost for this project could be phased over time dependent of funding availability,
however, with this phasing there is inherent ongoing risks to the organization as well as incremental
increased cost. If approved, the funding for the DR facility $1.2 million will be provided by a budget
transfer from the Unrestricted Fund Balance.
With this DR deployment there will be additional annual licensing expenses to mirror the applications and
services found in the current Data Center. These will be addressed in the annual operating budget.
The financial impacts of not providing the DR could be much larger than this initial investment should
RTD experience multiple outages of systems critical to the business operations.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Approval of this action will accelerate this risk mitigation effort and in case of a major failure would provide near
immediate operational recovery of key applications and system. This is the staff recommended action.
2. Place the funds from the Alameda land sale in the FISA for future FasTracks construction projects.

3. Instruct IT to continue its regularly scheduled backup and recovery activities and identify funding for the DR in
future budget years.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: December 2, 2014

From:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

December 2, 2014

Board Meeting Date: December 16, 2014

Subject:

Englewood Art Shuttle

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into a Cost
Sharing Agreement with the City of Englewood to provide RTD financial support for the operation of the
art circulator bus service in the City of Englewood. This agreement is for calendar year 2015 and is for
an amount not to exceed $282,000.00.
BACKGROUND
In 2003 the City of Englewood applied for and received a Congestion Mitigation Air Quality (CMAQ)
Grant for a circulator bus service. This grant was approved with funding available 2004-2007. CMAQ
funds were approved for 80% of the cost of the service. RTD contributed 10% of the expense and the
City of Englewood contributed 10%. The art shuttle was implemented in 2004 as a free service. In
September 2007, with the expiration of the CMAQ grant, the RTD took over funding of the art shuttle
because the high ridership exceeded RTD’s expectations. The City of Englewood continues the
management and marketing of the art shuttle. The City of Englewood covers all marketing and related
expenses. The art shuttle continues to be a free service that is sponsored by the City of Englewood.
The City of Englewood reimburses RTD for the fares that would have been paid if the art shuttle charged
a RTD fare.
The art shuttle currently operates from 6:30 AM to 6:30 PM on weekdays. There is no service on
Saturdays, Sundays or holidays. The shuttle operates between the Englewood light rail station and
Swedish Medical Center/Craig Hospital. The art shuttle operates as a free shuttle on a fifteen (15)
minute frequency. Ridership has averaged 688.3 boardings per day or 28.8 passengers per hour.

DISCUSSION
RTD shall contribute funding to the City of Englewood to support the operation of the art shuttle in an
amount not to exceed $282,000 in 2015.
This Agreement will be for a period of one year. The performance of the art shuttle will be assessed at
the end of the year to determine if performance expectations have been met and to determine if
continuation of the cost sharing agreement is warranted. Performance will be evaluated in terms of
RTD’s service standards. If it appears that service performance will not warrant continuation, RTD and
the City of Englewood will confer on modifications to the service in order to bring it into conformance.
The provision of art shuttle service through the 3rd Quarter in 2014 resulted in 28.8 passengers per hour
and an RTD subsidy per art shuttle passenger trip of $1.43. For comparison, the boardings for RTD local
fixed route service in 2012 ranged from an average of 34.6 boardings per hour for CBD local routes to an
average of 17.7 boardings per hour for suburban local service. The City of Englewood will continue to
pay for all fares for the art shuttle.

Packet Pg. 162

12.K

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for RTD support of the art shuttle were included in the approved 2015 RTD budget. Nothing
herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this Agreement.

ALTERNATIVES
1.
Approve the cost sharing agreement with the City of Englewood for the art shuttle circulator bus
service so that the City of Englewood can continue to provide this service to the residents,
visitors and businesses in the City of Englewood.
2.
Do not approve the cost sharing agreement. This course of action is not recommended as it may
result in a reduction to or elimination of the art shuttle circulator service.
