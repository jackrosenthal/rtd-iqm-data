BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Coping Panel Budget Transfer

Committee Meeting Date:
April 12, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
April 26, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve a budget transfer of $6,000,000 from the Unrestricted Fund
balance to Light Rail Maintenance of Way for coping panel repairs and authorize the General Manager
and CEO or her designee to enter a contract to complete repairs.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
Dave Jensen, Assistant General Manager, Rail Operations
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
In 2006, the Transportation Expansion (T-REX) project was completed through a partnership among
RTD, the Denver Regional Council of Governments, the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT),
the Federal Transit Administration and local municipalities, which widened I-25 and added the Southeast
Rail Corridor. As part of the $1.7 billion project, retaining walls were constructed and fitted with coping
panels, decorative concrete panels attached by metal fasteners to the top of the walls.
The original construction of the coping panels requires repairs for corrosion mitigation to maintain the
safety and integrity of the retaining walls and rail alignment. CDOT proposed a solution to install new
stainless-steel fasteners, epoxy and grouting to permanently rectify the corrosion issues.
In 2016, CDOT received an insurance settlement to complete the necessary repairs and engaged with a
contractor to begin repairs first on the I-25 coping panels followed by those on the RTD rail alignment.
After numerous attempts to complete the work, as well as multiple change order requests that were
denied, CDOT terminated the contract for convenience. In October 2019, CDOT paid RTD $4.1 million
to complete the repairs.
Beginning in late 2019, RTD attempted to complete this work in-house using internal labor and
equipment. Due to ongoing people power problems, weather constraints and other maintenance
obligations, this process has been determined to be ineffective as to time and cost.
Staff estimates, at a minimum, that an additional three years would be required to complete the coping
panel repairs using internal resources and has determined that the repairs will be completed more
expeditiously through a third-party contract.
DISCUSSION
RTD has expended $1.1 million of the $4.1 million from CDOT on coping panel repairs resulting in $3
million remaining in the unrestricted fund balance to complete the repairs. RTD currently estimates a
cost of up to $6 million to complete the repairs necessitating an additional appropriation of $3 million.

Packet Pg. 17

16.A

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The financial impact of this action item will be to appropriate $6 million from the unrestricted fund
balance, of which $3 million has already been provided by CDOT. The estimated unanticipated additional
cost of up to $3 million is available from positive budget variances in 2021.
