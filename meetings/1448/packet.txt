BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: July 3, 2013

From:

William Van Meter, Assistant General Manager,
Planning

GM

Date:

July 2, 2013

Board Meeting Date: July 9, 2013

Subject:

2013 Title VI Service Monitoring

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Civil Rights Committee that the Board of Directors review and approve the
2013 Title VI Service Monitoring Results and the future monitoring on an annual basis, to comply with
federal laws, regulations and guidelines related to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
BACKGROUND
Pursuant to Section 12 of the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) Master Agreement, RTD must comply
with 49 CFR part 21 and FTA Circular 4702.1B, which effectuates Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of
1964 (Title VI). Title VI prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color and national origin from
recipients of federal financial assistance (grants, loans, etc...). RTD complies with Title VI by
committing to the following guiding principles:
1. Ensure that FTA-assisted benefits and related services are made available and are equitably
distributed without regard to race, color, or national origin;
2. Preserve the level and quality of FTA-assisted transit services, providing equal access for any
person without regard to race, color or national origin;
3. Create opportunities for the public to participate in transit planning and decision-making without
regard to race, color or national origin;
4. Select the location of transit services and facilities without regard to race, color or national origin;
and
5. Take prompt and immediate action to correct and remediate disparate impacts borne by any
group of people of a race, color, or national origin.
The Title VI Service Monitoring Program is one of the mechanisms used to follow these guiding
principles.
DISCUSSION
Per FTA Circular 4702.1B, as an operator of 50 or more fixed route vehicles in peak service, which is
located in an urbanized area, RTD is required to monitor the application of its service standards and
policies with respect to fixed route service. To determine if service standards and policies are adhered to
indiscriminately, the service provided to minority populations is compared to service provided to nonminority populations as required by FTA guidance. The 2013 Title VI Service Monitoring Results report
describes the scope, method and results of RTD’s Service Monitoring. The FTA also requires transit
providers to officially establish the frequency in which Title VI Service Monitoring will occur. Future Title

VI Service Monitoring will occur and be reported annually, as a part of the Service Performance Report
presented by Service Development.
The highlights and action items resulting from the 2013 Title VI Service Monitoring are summarized in
the presentation attached to this board report. The full report is available separately in the Board Office
for review.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The adoption of the 2013 Title VI Service Monitoring Results and annual monitoring frequency do not
result in any direct or foreseeable financial impacts.
ALTERNATIVES
1) Accept the recommended action. It is recommended by the Civil Rights Committee that the Board
of Directors review and approve the 2013 Title VI Service Monitoring Results and the future
monitoring on an annual basis, to comply with federal laws, regulations and guidelines related to
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
2) Do not accept the recommended action. This is not recommended as it could jeopardize current
and future federal funding.
