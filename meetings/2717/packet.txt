Subject:

Transit Oriented Development Evaluation
Guidelines

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning, Capital Programs and FasTracks Committee that the Board of
Directors approve the attached Resolution Number
(the “Resolution”), the “Transit Oriented
Development Evaluation Guidelines” to provide policy direction to RTD staff on evaluating transit
oriented development (TOD) projects moving forward.
BACKGROUND
RTD has invested over $5.8 billion dollars in the rapid transit network for the Denver Metropolitan
Region since 2004. A direct result of this investment and previous rapid transit investments by RTD is a
tremendous level of interest in TOD at or adjacent to stations along RTD’s rapid transit network. In
2016, the Board initiated RTD TOD Assessment was completed by outside consultants. The final report
for the TOD Assessment indicated that RTD would benefit from “achieving mission clarity” on TOD by
more clearly defining the value of TOD for the agency.
DISCUSSION
RTD’s current policy guidance for TOD, including the Strategic Plan for TOD (2010), provides limited
guidance on how RTD should access the value of TOD for the agency. Policy issues related to fiscal
sustainability, social equity, and safety and security are not clearly articulated in the Strategic Plan for
TOD and other policy documents. Clear direction on how to evaluate these policy issues would provide
more transparency and clarity in decision making for TOD projects for both internal staff and outside
stakeholders including local jurisdictions and developers.
It would therefore be beneficial to have TOD evaluation guidelines to provide a clearer direction to RTD
staff and external stakeholders on TOD projects. Draft TOD Evaluation Guidelines were presented at the
December 5th Planning, Capital Programs, and FasTracks Committee meeting. Board feedback on the
draft guidelines was provided at the meeting.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no expected direct financial impact of this resolution. This resolution requires that financial
implications be considered as part of any decision related to TOD projects.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Approve the attached Resolution Number
_
(the “Resolution”), the Transit Oriented
Development (TOD) Evaluation Guidelines, that is recommended by the Planning, Capital
Programs and FasTracks Committee, to provide policy direction to RTD staff on evaluating TOD
projects moving forward.

continued inconsistency with decision making on the value of TOD projects to RTD.

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT
RESOLUTION NO. ____, SERIES OF 2018
(Transit Oriented Development Evaluation Guidelines)
A RESOLUTION PROVIDING POLICY GUIDANCE ON EVALUATING THE VALUE OF
TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT TO THE RTD.
WHEREAS, The Regional Transportation District plans, designs, builds and operates mass
transit for the Denver region; and
WHEREAS, the provision of transit service to the Denver region by RTD influences
development patterns and supports transit oriented development; and
WHEREAS, decisions on transit oriented development at RTD are governed by RTD
statutes and a broad set of internal policies including RTD’s Strategic Plan for TOD (2010),
Policy for Joint Development and Disposition of Real Property (RTD Resolution 15, Series
of 2015), Unsolicited Proposal Policy for Real Property (RTD Resolution 16, Series of
2015), and Parking Guiding Principles (Resolution 24, Series of 2016).
WHEREAS, RTD staff would benefit from additional policy guidance from the RTD Board of
Directors on evaluating TOD projects.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE REGIONAL
TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT TO ADOPT THE FOLLOWING EVALUATION GUIDELINES
FOR TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS:
TOD Evaluation Guidelines
A transit-oriented development (TOD) project occurring on or adjacent to RTD property will
inevitably affect RTD. When RTD is in a position to influence the TOD project, either by
entering into an agreement with the developer or jurisdiction, or through regulatory means,
and a decision is required regarding RTD’s participation, RTD must consider the value of
the TOD project to RTD.
The principles and evaluation factors below were developed to guide RTD staff’s
assessment of the TOD project’s value. As every TOD project is unique, each one will be
evaluated on a case-by-case basis according to its total impact (positive or negative) to
RTD.
TOD Value Principles
The following principles set clear standards and thresholds for new TOD projects. Every
new TOD project is expected to satisfy all six principles.

Packet Pg. 5

1.B.1

1. The TOD project must be budget neutral or budget positive for RTD.
Evaluations of budget impact should take into account direct revenue to RTD,
including property sale or lease revenue, increased fare revenue, or other revenue
sources. Replacement, major rehabilitation, maintenance, administrative, and other
operational costs, as well as any capital expenditures, should be considered over
the long and short terms.
2. The TOD project must be expected to increase ridership.
The proposer must demonstrate that ridership is reasonably projected to increase as
a result of project implementation including having ridership projections reviewed
and approved by RTD staff. Ridership increases over the short and long-term will
be considered, but short term increases are preferred.
3. Where feasible, ground leases of RTD property are preferred over sales.
RTD prefers to retain a fee interest in property. In some cases, such as condo
development or an unfavorable economy, a ground lease may not be feasible, and a
land sale should be considered.
4. The TOD project must reflect the Parking Guiding Principles (PGP).
RTD will evaluate third-party parking operations and parking replacement based on
the factors described in the PGP or such other relevant guidance provided by the
Board.
5. The TOD project must enhance safety and security.
The TOD project must positively contribute to the safety and security of the RTD
system by remedying any known problems at the site, as well as by addressing
issues of pedestrian safety and walkability, and by increasing “eyes on the street”
through activation.
6. The TOD project must have jurisdiction support.
The TOD project must be consistent with the local jurisdiction’s plans and the
jurisdiction, formally or informally, must demonstrate support for the project.
Evaluation Factors
TOD projects will additionally be measured against the following evaluation factors. Unlike
the TOD Value Principles, the evaluation factors should be considered as whole, with the
understanding that TOD projects may not satisfy all evaluation factors. In determining the
total impact of a TOD project to RTD, Tier One Factors should be given more weight than
Tier Two Factors.
Tier One Factors:
 Ground Lease/Land Sale
Revenue from a land sale or ground lease should support RTD’s fiscal sustainability.


Increased Ridership/Fare Revenues
Generating new ridership supports RTD’s mission and directly benefits RTD through
increased fare revenues.



Replacement or New Facilities
Leveraging development to provide new or replacement facilities that are needed for
transit operations supports a state of good repair as determined by RTD (the value

Packet Pg. 6

1.B.1

of the facility may be large, such as for a new parking structure, or small, such as
for a Driver Relief Station).


Outsourced Maintenance
Assigning maintenance responsibilities, such as landscaping, cleaning, general
maintenance, snow and ice removal, and graffiti removal, to a third party in a
manner that is consistent with RTD standards and does not increase RTD’s
administrative burden reduces costs and risks for RTD.



Jurisdiction Support
Jurisdiction support for a TOD project beyond basic planning demonstrates the
importance of the project to the local community. Demonstrations of strong
jurisdiction support might include updating zoning, providing financial support,
employing Tax Increment Financing (TIF), contributing to capital projects that
support the TOD project, or assuming part of the TOD project’s risk.



Enhanced RTD Operations
Improved transit operations through more efficient routing, more optimal transfers,
or other operational efficiencies directly benefit RTD.

Tier Two Factors:


Improved Safety/Security
Addressing safety and security issues such as emergency ingress and egress,
fire/life/safety communication, lighting and tripping hazards will positively impact
RTD. The activation of previously isolated stations also positively impacts security.



Upgraded Rider Amenities/Access
Upgraded rider amenities or increased options or access to RTD transit improve the
rider experience and may include improved seating, vending, walkways, open
space, wayfinding, and First Mile/Last Mile solutions.



Community Facilities/Affordable Housing
RTD supports and benefits from community facilities and/or affordable housing at
TOD projects that are consistent with local jurisdiction policies.



Brand Image Enhancement
RTD’s brand is enhanced and RTD benefits as a whole when RTD is positively
associated with a TOD project that supports community objectives.

Subject:

Contract Amendment; 1st year (2018) option
2017-2019 Street Improvements & Shelter
Installations Contract # 37DM002

General

Board Meeting Date: February 27, 2018

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to award a
Contract Amendment to initiate the first option year (2018) of a three-year contract for the annual Street
Improvements & Shelter Installation contract with Manion Construction, Inc. for $371,409.75. Funding
for this Contract Amendment is provided by the annual 2018 Capital Programs Expense Budgets.
BACKGROUND
Section 810.2 of the United States Department of Transportation Standards specifies requirements for
new, altered, or relocated bus stops to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The
Street Improvements program serves the various needs of RTD and its patrons by providing improved
access to bus stops by installing boarding areas, and connecting walkways meeting ADA standards. Bus
pads, miscellaneous street and various emergency park-n-Ride repairs are also performed under this
contract.
Due to the repetitive nature of this work, a three-year contract was determined to be an effective way to
manage this work for the District. Bids were received through a publicly advertised contract, which was
awarded to Manion Construction, Inc. as the lowest responsive and responsible bidder in April of 2017.
Manion has had the Street Improvements contract since 2010 and has proven to be a very good
contractor. The current base contract value and proposed amendment are as follows:
Amount
Amendments
Total
Base year, 2017
$ 339,872.50
$ 150,000.00
$ 489,872.50
First option year (2018))
$ 371,409.75
0.00
$ 371,409.75
Grand Total: Base Year, Amendments, and first option year (2018) =
$ 861,282.25
DISCUSSION
This second amendment (1st year option) will increase the contract by $ 371,409.75, creating a total
contract amount, including this amendment, of $ 861,282.25.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The $371,409.75 funding for this Board Action shall come from the 2018 Capital Programs Expense
Budgets that are within the approved budget.
DBE GOAL
The contract requires 15% SBE participation - Manion Construction Inc. is a SBE certified contractor
thereby meeting this goal.

Packet Pg. 13

1.B.2

ALTERNATIVES
Accept the Recommended Action.
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to award a
Contract Amendment to initiate the first option year (2018) of a three-year contract for the annual Street
Improvements & Shelter Installation contract with Manion Construction, Inc. for $371,409.75. Funding
for this Contract Amendment is provided by the annual 2018 Capital Programs Expense Budgets.
Do Not Accept the Recommended Action.
Do not authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to award a
Contract Amendment to initiate the first option year (2018) year of a three-year option contract for the
annual Street Improvements & Shelter Installation contract with Manion Construction, Inc. Instead
develop a new Invitation for Bid (IFB) for this year’s construction work. This is not recommended
because:
a. It would take away RTD’s ability to move, alter, or relocate bus stops.
b. It would create a delay in constructing the planned 2018 street improvements
b. The current Contractor is providing a good quality product in a reasonable time.
c. The 2018 contract prices are considered to be fair and reasonable.
d. The District desires to partner with the DBE/SBE Community and Manion Construction is a
SBE certified contractor.
