#### 1. 2018 - 002 : Transit Oriented Development Evaluation Guidelines

It is recommended by the Planning, Capital Programs and FasTracks Committee that the Board of Directors approve the attached Resolution Number ­      (the “Resolution”), the “Transit Oriented Development Evaluation Guidelines” to provide policy direction to RTD staff on evaluating transit oriented development (TOD) projects moving forward.

Motion:               Director Solano made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the February 27, 2018 Board Meeting.

Director Anderson seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Bill Sirois, Senior Manager of Transit Oriented Communities, stated that he wanted to point out a few items included in the Board Report. He noted that a few slides had been included to help the Board remember what had been established such as the purpose, standards for projects, and the categories/elements of the guidelines. He remarked that the first conversation had taken place at the end of October with additional input from the Board in December.

Motion

to Amend:               Director Anderson said that she would like one change made to item number 3, and that a sentence be added that would state, “In cases where a sale is considered, RTD should take such actions that will preserve RTD’s long-term interest”. She said the reason she wanted the addition was because RTD uses Transit Oriented Development (TOD) to increase ridership which is needed throughout the entire system. She added that she would like this sentence included so that the agency can hold entities or jurisdictions to their word over issues that may arise.

Director Broom seconded the motion.

Director Hoy asked for Director Anderson to repeat her statement one more time, which she did.

Director Hoy commented that the addition did not sound too onerous and that was what RTD would want to do anyway.

Director Anderson commented that the intent was there but the words were not.

Director Folska, Ph.D., asked why Director Anderson used the word “should” instead of “shall”.

Director Anderson commented that someone with legal knowledge wrote the sentence for her. She said that she would defer to RTD’s legal team if they thought other words would make it stronger.

Rolf Asphaug, General Counsel, noted that he was not involved in the drafting of Director Anderson’s sentence, but he noted that in paragraph 1, it discussed factors that should be considered.

Director Folska stated that the word “should” was weak and asked why RTD would bother having the resolution.

Mr. Asphaug explained that “should” was an appropriate word to use. He noted that “shall” could be useful if staff were trying to ensure another party was doing what they were supposed to do.

Committee Chair Lubow remarked that she did not understand the need for the resolution. She said that this would not harm anything but asked what this change would do.

Mr. Sirois noted that, based on past staff experiences, Director Anderson was trying to alleviate a future situation where staff would have worked with a jurisdiction for a process or plan that ended up being changed by the other party. He said that her addition would allow RTD to hold their feet to the fire and if staff can get their promises included in an agreement it would also help to hold them accountable.

Director Broom equated Director Anderson’s addition to a deed restriction. He commented that staff would have to reduce the price or risk having a buyer walk away from the project.

Chair Tisdale remarked that RTD would want to have a reverter, or conditional deed, on the sale of RTD property as it relates to TOD. He said it made sense because it would give staff flexibility for transactions.

Director Menten asked Mr. Asphaug his opinion on a property in question in Arvada. She asked what this amendment would do if the city council voted down a developer’s request to build a taller structure.

Mr. Asphaug said that it was difficult to comment on something like that. He explained that this resolution would advise staff on what they should be taking into account when dealing with that type of situation.

Mr. Sirois added that it would also depend on the hook that was negotiated with the local jurisdiction.

Director Menten noted that the deal in Arvada included a parking garage.

General Manager Genova explained that overall the question was about how the resolution would impact a decision by a city council. He explained that the resolution would not have a large impact, but it would provide guidance to staff on how to pursue TOD projects, while also telling others who want to do TOD business with RTD what the agency’s guidelines are. He said that the resolution would be important in terms of TOD in the future.

Committee Chair Lubow declared the motion to amend PASSED.

Director Williams stated that, though she was going to ask Mr. Sirois to summarize the whole thing in one sentence, the General Manager did an excellent job of expressing the point of this procedure, and she thanked him for that.

Director Mihalik noted that on bullet point 2, despite TOD efforts, system ridership was down.

Director Menten explained that she was a no vote because she would prefer to sell land to developers who would create property taxes for the district.

Director Folska, Ph.D., added that for years staff had been telling the Board that, when ridership was down, it directly correlated to gas prices, as opposed to TOD.

Committee Chair Lubow declared the motion PASSED.

##### a. TOD Evaluation Guidelines Board Action

#### 2. Amend # 3 In cases where a sale is considered RTD should take such action that will preserve RTD's long term interest

#### 3. Contract Amendment; 1st year (2018) option 
2017-2019 Street Improvements & Shelter Installations
Contract # 37DM002

It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to award a Contract Amendment to initiate the first option year (2018) of a three-year contract for the annual Street Improvements & Shelter Installation contract with Manion Construction, Inc. for $371,409.75.  Funding for this Contract Amendment is provided by the annual 2018 Capital Programs Expense Budgets.

Motion:               Director Anderson made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the February 27, 2018 Board Meeting.

Director Williams seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Cory Granrud, Design Manager, stated that staff was before the Board to move forward with a one-year contact amendment. He explained that the contract was publicly advertised last spring and the motion tonight was for the first of two one-year options. He said that the primary function of the contractor was to provide street improvements, bus pads, sidewalks, bus stop enhancements, ADA improvements, and other work as needed. He said that staff worked with the service-planning department to identify stops that need improvements and noted that RTD did a wide variety of improvements and emergency repairs. He added that this was the vendor’s third contract with RTD and that he did quality work that was fairly priced. He further added that staff enjoyed working with the contractor and he helped RTD a lot.

Director Folska, Ph.D., asked if staff had resolved the issue with the braille at Civic Center Station.

Henry Stopplecamp, Assistant General Manager of Capital Programs, said yes and noted that the two signs had been fixed. He added that staff was currently working on signage outside of that process.

Director Folska, Ph.D., inquired if there was a clearly defined space for paratransit and Access-a-Cab riders.

Mr. Stopplecamp stated that at Civic Center Station the first gate was used for paratransit riders.

General Manager Genova commented that the designated area for paratransit riders was on the 16th Street Mall, but he would follow up with Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, regarding the Access-a-Cab drop off area. He noted that, in regards to the braille signage, all of the requirements had been completed.

Director Anderson noted that last Friday, she attended a round table discussion with a mixture of people. She said that one of the things she found interesting was that an individual who never used public transportation spoke out quite forcefully about people waiting in snowstorms at bus stops. She said that it speaks volumes that people who never ride the bus or take the train do pay attention to how people are treated at bus stops.

Committee Chair Lubow declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

#### 1. Pass Program Study

Mr. Sirois stated that Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager of Planning, was out ill, so he and Michael Washington, Transit Equity Manager, would present this time.

Mr. Washington noted that this would be a redundant review for the Board, and he would bypass the first few slides and move to the December meeting recap. He said that, at the December meeting, the Pass Program Working Group (PPWG) went in with three options and left with one. He noted that group saw that options B and C resulted in loses of revenue and ridership and the decision was to move forward with option E. He stated the group had asked for two variations of that option which would become options Y and Z.

Mr. Washington commented that, for the January meeting:

•          It was well attended by the public and many commenters voiced strong support for a Youth Program and Low-Income Program

•          Discussed and eliminated Option Y due to projected ridership and revenue losses

•          Agreed on primary elements of Option Z

•          Preserve: EcoPass, CollegePass, Nonprofit Program and FlexPass

•          Create: Youth Program, Low-Income Program, bulk purchase discount

•          Used last two meetings to answer remaining questions:

•          Discounts and Surcharges: Could discounts in one program be offset by surcharges on another program?

•          Low-Income Program: What percentage of discount? What was the definition of “low-income” (e.g. $45,000 in annual household income)?

•          Youth Program: What level of discount? 12 and under free?

•          Minimize increases to base fares?

Mr. Washington noted that there was a PPWG meeting earlier in the day where other details of the program were discussed. He said that the group was close to hammering out the final details for a recommendation and the group had been able to see what they could reasonably make a decision on versus what they could not. He explained that it was a complex process and the group was finding a deeper understanding of how RTD worked and how the agency made it decisions. He added that this process had allowed RTD to have a more constructive conversation about what RTD could and could not do.

Director Williams stated that she had been attending the meetings from the beginning and this group of people had just come to realize that their names would be on whatever decision came out of the group. She added that there was a 30-minute open session before each meeting where a number of advocate groups spoke, but they did not stay for the entire meeting, so their knowledge of what happened at the meetings was skewed. She thanked everyone for all of their hard work and said she would be interested to see what happened in the final meeting.

Director Menten noted that in the presentation, the definition of what was considered “low-income” had yet to be determined. She asked for an explanation of how that number would be reached.

Mr. Washington explained that the group was using the federal poverty guidelines. He said the group decided the appropriate level was 185% of the federal poverty guidelines and for the Denver metro area would be equivalent to $45,000 for a household of three.

Director Menten asked what that figure would equate to in terms of RTD’s ridership.

Mr. Washington stated that 41% of RTD’s ridership would be considered low income.

Director Broom asked if staff could elaborate on what a bulk purchase would be.

Mr. Washington said that the group had not gotten to that level yet. He noted that, when conferences are held in town, there was always a large request for tickets and some group members were looking at a discount for that. He said that, if he had to channel the intent of bulk purchases, it would be a purchase of 100 or more passes.

Director Hoy commented that the goal of the PPWG was not to subsidize more passengers. He stated that under option E there was a youth provision, but that would need to be subsidized by someone other than RTD.

Mr. Washington explained that the proposed youth discount was 70%, whereas the current discount was 50%. He said the revenue change for youth passes would be negligible, but the bigger swings in revenue come from employer programs and low-income passes. He added that the PPWG had been told that the recommendation had to be fiscally responsible and it must meet RTD’s Strategic Budget Plan (SBP).

Director Hoy noted that, when this group started out, RTD did not want to have any responsibility to vet people who qualified for low-income passes.

Mr. Washington said that RTD had made it very clear to the PPWG that RTD cannot complete the means testing for low-income passes.

Director Folska, Ph.D., said that this was a challenging situation, which brought up nightmares from increasing the fares a few years ago. She added that RTD should not give a discount to people coming to Denver for conferences or conventions.

Director Walker asked if the proposed discounts would be a fixed amount or a percentage.

Mr. Washington stated that it had been discussed as a percentage.

Director Walker inquired if there had been any discussion about the debt-to-income ratio for low-income passes. He noted that the level of income was relative to the debt the household had.

Committee Chair Lubow remarked that it seemed to her that RTD gave some people an extra discount while taking other discounts away and added that the Eco-Pass had been accused of being inequitable for some time.

Mr. Washington commented that the recent changes to the Eco-Pass made it revenue neutral.

Director Williams stated that, between the mandatory discounts to the disabled and seniors, the non-profit pass program, the Eco-Pass Program, and youth and low-income constituents, 81% of RTD’s ridership would receive some type of discount. She said that what is being proposed by the PPWG was a whole lot of discounts for many people. She added that there had been misinformation about who would complete the low-income verifications and noted that RTD was not a human service entity and therefore could not do those types of verifications.

General Manager Genova said that the RTD Board would determine what they want to do with the PPWG recommendation either by adopting all of it, parts of it, or not adopting it at all. He noted that the recommendation made by the PPWG would go to him and the senior leadership team for analysis before it would be presented to the Board. He highlighted that the recommendation would not be an RTD recommendation, but a PPWG recommendation.

Chair Tisdale said that it would be beneficial if the PPWG provided the RTD Board with alternatives to consider.

Director Menten stated that she agreed with Director Hoy and that examining low-income passes was not the Board’s intent for the PPWG.

Director Hoy explained that everyone needed to remember that people getting on the bus at full fare were being subsidized. He said that there was already a healthy discount, and if it was discounted further, RTD would be in trouble. He said this was not where he thought the PPWG was going to go.

Committee Chair Lubow thanked everyone for their hard work and noted that she had a better understanding of the equities between the various passes.

##### a. Pass Program Study Update  - Board Planning Committee  - 2-06-2018 (v.3)

#### 2. Southwest Chief & Front Range Passenger Rail Commission

Mr. Sirois explained that Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager of Planning, was RTD’s representative on the commission. He said that:

- Senate Bill 17-153 created the Southwest Chief (SW Chief) and Front Range Passenger Rail Commission, directing the Commission to:

o        Continue Amtrak SW Chief Line track rehabilitation, expansion to Pueblo, and consider adding service to Walsenburg, AND

o        Report to the Colorado General Assembly by December 1, 2017, regarding proposals for the development of a Front Range passenger rail system

−       Commission continues statutory purpose beyond that date

−       Authority to receive & expend funds

He added that:

- Commission appointments were finalized in July, 2017, and the Commission has been housed by CDOT:

o        Two freight railroad industry representatives

o        Five representatives from the Councils of Government (COGs)/Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) in the Front Range

o        RTD representative (Bill Van Meter)

o        Two statewide passenger rail advocates

o        SW Chief representative, and

o        Non-voting representatives from CDOT and Amtrak

He noted that to date:

•          Seven Commission meetings & over 12 subcommittee meetings had been held

•          Participated in SW Chief Tiger 9 application submitted October 16, 2017

•          Submittal to General Assembly regarding Front Range Passenger Rail made on December 1, 2017

He said that:

- Commission identified five distinct phases for delivery of Front Range passenger rail to the citizens of Colorado

o        Define the Service union

§         Conceptual Cost: $8.7 million

§         Timeframe: 1-2.5 years

o        Formation of Governing Authority

§         Conceptual Cost: $.5 million

§         Timeframe: 4-6 years

o        Final Design and Construction

§         Conceptual Cost: TBD

§         Timeframe: 7-15 years

o        Ribbon Cutting

He noted that issues to consider were:

- Target Markets

- Alignment

- Service & Operating Characteristics

- Costs

- Potential Funding Options

- Goverance Structure & Service Operator

- Regulatory Environment

- SWC and FRPR Commission Considerations

- Potential Legislative Request

- Commission’s next steps

He remarked that:

- Funding for First Project Phase - $8.7 million ($2.9 million/year)

o        Conduct public and stakeholder engagement throughout the Front Range

§         Define mobility needs, who will be served

§         Define/confirm vision for front range passenger rail

o        Prepare service development plan

§         Define preferred alignment/route

§         Define service/operating characteristics (all day, commute only, etc.)

§         Define technology, speed, station locations/spacing

§         Define high-level capital & operating costs

§         Pursue corridor & ROW preservation

o        Hire executive director or project manager and support staff

He added that:

- At the January 9, 2018 Commission Meeting, the Commission requested that RTD and the COG’s / MPO’s Boards consider Resolutions and/or other actions:

o        In support of the proposed multi-phase approach proposed by the Commission, AND

o        In support of the Commission’s request to the Legislature for funding for the first phase - $8.7 million ($2.9 million / year)

Director Anderson said that, before she could vote on a recommendation, she would need to have more information. She asked if staff had any idea what the potential amount of ridership would be.

Mr. Sirois said he would have to get back to the Board with that information.

Director Broom said that years ago, he sat in on one of the studies executed by Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) and their estimated costs were astronomical and ridership was projected to be low. He said that he never could have envisioned how this type of rail service would work until the population of Colorado tripled. He recommended that staff review the previous studies that had been done which were deemed inconclusive, and the Board should review them too before voting on a position.

Director Folska, Ph.D., commented that this was a bad idea and RTD might shoot itself in the foot by supporting this item.

Director Hoy added that there could be political ramifications for supporting this and there was a lot more at stake than just the dollars. He said that RTD needed to be careful about taking a stand in the form of a resolution and that staff should confer with the agency’s lobbyists to get their input too.

##### a. SW Chief & FR Passenger Rail Update

### D. Other Matters

Director Folska, Ph.D., commented that she agreed with Director Hoy’s earlier statements and added that RTD needed to keep staff focused on RTD issues. She then asked if RTD was in the process of rebranding itself.

General Manager Genova explained that RTD had been changing some of its public facing materials and staff was making updates to templates to fall in line with that change. He noted that, in relation to the SW Chief, the state passed a law which created a commissioner spot for RTD. He said that the SW Chief rail alignment could connect or interface with RTD’s system and it was important for RTD to have a seat at that table. He noted that the SW Chief update was brought forward because that entity had asked for RTD’s input, and after the comments made this evening, staff will have to determine if a resolution item will be brought to the Board or not.

Director Menten thanked Mr. Gary Van Dorn for illustrating to her that the braille signage at Civic Center Station was improperly labeled. She said that he took her on a tour of the station and added that the National Federation of the Blind of Colorado (NFBCO) was also hosting a Twitter series on braille signage

General Manager Genova stated that staff had two items that they would like to provide to the Board. He noted that the US Department of Transportation had asked RTD to travel to Washington, D.C., to provide a briefing on Positive Train Control (PTC), which would outline RTD’s current position with the technology, barriers RTD had encountered, and what implementation was left to be done. He noted that he and key members of staff would be traveling to Washington, D.C., for the PTC meeting on Wednesday, February 14th. He added that a lot of class one railroads were grappling with multiple users on its lines, but that was not a problem RTD was experiencing.

Mr. Stopplecamp introduced Andy Mutz, Engineering Project Manager, to provide a Southwest Rail Extension (SERE) update.

Mr. Mutz commented that staff was planning a nine day shutdown of the SE Rail from March 16th through March 26th in order to replace tracks and overhead catenary wires. He noted that patrons will have to drive north to Dry Creek or further to catch a train during that time. He explained that the March timeframe was chosen because it would offer two weekends, and also because it was the week of spring break for the Auraria Campus schools. He noted that this was a big endeavor and staff had been working on this for over a year.

General Manager Genova added that CDOT would also be completing work during the same timeframe, and the goal was to go get all of the work done during one block of time instead of having multiple shutdowns.

Director Broom asked for clarification about an email relating to N Line disruptions.

Mr. Stopplecamp explained that the N Line would be tied into Denver Union Station, which would require a shut down. He said that the challenge would be to tie in the overhead power system with the existing wires, which was under the purview of the FRA, and RTD must follow their oversight.

### F. Adjourn

Committee Chair Lubow adjourned the meeting at 7:16 p.m.
