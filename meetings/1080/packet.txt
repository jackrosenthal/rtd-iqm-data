Moving Forward: Filling the FasTracks Internal Savings Account

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors direct staff to move forward with implementation of the eight, highest
value, recommended opportunities identified as part of the Risk Allocation Matrix

(RAM). Any funding realized through these activities will be tracked separately and
added to a new budget account, the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA).
The status of the FISA will be reported to the RTD Board of Directors on a monthly
basis, and the FISA will be incorporated into the FasTracks Strategic Budget Plan
and Annual Budget. Expenditures from the FISA will be subject to Board approval,
with the staff recommended project goals identified below in the Background
section of this report confirmed as the current RTD Board project goals for the
FISA.
Specifically, it is recommended that staff move forward with the following
activities:
1. Beginning in 2014, increase FasTracks funding to support base system
operations at the rate of inflation as defined by the Consumer Price Index (CPI):
 Estimated to contribute $24 million to the FISA by 2017;
2. Reduce FasTracks Minimum Unrestricted Fund Balance once construction
milestones have been reached, the majority of the Eagle Project grant funding
has been received and RTD has better information on the growth of sales and
use tax:
 Estimated to contribute up to $72 million to the FISA by 2017;
3. Reduce FasTracks Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Fund Balance from three
to two months:
 Estimated to contribute $10 million to the FISA by 2017;
4. Defer Southwest Corridor Extension Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR) relocation –
complete once funding is identified for the entire project:
 Estimated to contribute $9 million to the FISA by 2017;
5. Work to achieve project underruns on FasTracks projects currently under
contract:
 Estimated to contribute $15 million to the FISA by 2017;
6. Sell or lease RTD properties, where possible:
 Estimated to contribute $20 million to the FISA by 2017;
7. Request stakeholders to increase financial participation above the current level
of 2.5%:
 Estimated contribution – To Be Determined;
8. Work with legislature to allow RTD to audit sales and use tax receipts and
provide RTD with parity with the State on sales tax exemptions (i.e., ensure
exemptions are the same for both RTD and the State in all cases). Establish this
as RTD’s number one legislative priority. Begin working immediately with
government relations staff, lobbyists, legal counsel and other stakeholders to
initiate and support the introduction of a bill(s) on these topics during the 2013
legislative session:
 Estimated to contribute up to $127 million to the FISA by 2017.

Approval of the opportunities listed above will have a positive impact to the
FasTracks capital program through the establishment of the FISA with a goal of
achieving $300 million by 2017. It is anticipated that these eight highest priority
opportunities alone could fund the FISA up to or exceeding $277 million by 2017.
The Board directs staff to continue working to identify other funding opportunities
through the RAM analysis process in 2013 for potential Board consideration at a
later date.
M.
Resolution Regarding Easement Agreements and Indemnification of Claims
with Suncor Energy (U.S.A.) Inc.
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board
of Directors adopt the attached resolution.
The resolution authorizes the
General Manager or his designee to negotiate and execute two easement
agreements with Suncor; one agreement that grants an easement to RTD for the
North Metro Rail Line (“NMRL”) project through Suncor property in Adams
County (the “Bridge Easement”) and another agreement that grants an easement
to Suncor to construct a pipeline in the RTD owned Boulder Industrial Lead
(“BIL”) right of way (the “Pipeline Easement”). The Bridge Easement requires
RTD to waive sovereign immunity to the extent it may be applicable, and to
indemnify Suncor for claims arising out of RTD’s use of the Bridge Easement in
an amount up to $200 million and to purchase general liability insurance in that
amount from the date of commencement of construction of the bridge and to
maintain it through termination of the Bridge Easement. RTD would receive
$10,000,000 from Suncor in exchange for the Pipeline Easement, and would
pay Suncor $836,420 for the Bridge Easement. This would result in net revenue
of $9,163,580 to RTD, which would be applied to the cost of expansion of the
Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility (CRMF) to accommodate the North Metro
vehicles.
It is further recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD
Board of Directors authorize the transfer of $836,420 from the FasTracks
Contingency Reserve for the acquisition of the Bridge Easement. These funds
would be replenished out of the $10,000,000 to be received from Suncor in
exchange for the Pipeline Easement.

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: November 28, 2012

From:

Richard F. Clarke, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

November 28, 2012

Board Meeting Date: December 13, 2012

Subject:

Approval of the Purchase of Six Electric
Multiple Units (EMU) Vehicles for the North
Metro Rail Line

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager to approve the purchase of six Electric Multiple Units (EMU) vehicles for the
North Metro Rail Line through the Denver Transit Partners (DTP) Rolling Stock Option in accordance
with the EAGLE Concession Agreement (CA) Section 31.1, for an amount not to exceed $24 million.
Funding to purchase two of the vehicles is included in the 2013 Adopted Budget for the North Metro
Corridor project.
It is further recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager to transfer $16 million from the FasTracks Contingency Reserve to
the North Metro Corridor project budget to fund the purchase of the additional four EMU vehicles.
BACKGROUND
Final design for Phase 1 (DUS to 72 nd Avenue Station) of the North Metro Rail Line (NMRL) is
underway and construction for the first 2.5 miles from DUS to the National Western Stock Show
(NWSS) is funded. RTD is actively pursuing avenues to secure the funds for the next 3.5 miles from
NWSS to 72 nd Avenue with the intent of building Phase 1 as a continuous construction package.
Construction of the 2.5 mile segment from DUS to NWSS is scheduled to be completed and ready
for revenue service in 2017. A single two car train is required to operate from DUS to NWSS with
30 minute headways. An additional four vehicles are needed to provide 30 minute headways to 72 nd
Avenue.
The EAGLE CA anticipated the purchase of the North Metro fleet and included an option that allows
the purchase of no less than 8 and no more than 24 additional Cars (the Rolling Stock Option Cars).
The CA allows us to exercise the option up to 24 months prior to the scheduled delivery of the last
base car. Based on the current revised baseline schedule, that date is approximately February 2013.
DISCUSSION
The Eagle CA only allows for a minimum purchase of eight vehicles. DTP is willing to allow RTD to
exercise the option in the EAGLE CA for the reduced number of cars provided that the request is
authorized before December 20, 2012. The vehicles will be identical to the Eagle vehicles and will
share the Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility (CRMF). Identical vehicles will all ow for interchange
of vehicles and parts.
The cost estimate included in the 2012 Annual Program Evaluation (APE) for two EMU vehicles was
$8,020,000. This price assumed a purchase of between 15 and 30 vehicles. The cost for a
manufacturer to mobilize to produce such a small order would greatly exceed that price if a
manufacturer could even be convinced to bid on such a limited order.

Packet Pg. 8

B.11.A

If RTD were to purchase only two vehicles now and look to buy the additional four vehicles after
funding is secured for the segment to 72 nd Avenue the cost is estimated to be, at a minimum, in
excess of $6 million per vehicle.
We recommend exercising the option of purchasing six cars through the EAGLE CA because the
price is reasonable, allows for interchangeable parts with the EAGLE fleet, and continues to show
forward movement in taking concrete steps toward to goal of completing the full build out of the
NMRL.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for the purchase of two vehicles is included in the 2013 Adopted Budget for the North
Metro Corridor project. Funding for the purchase of the remaining four vehicles would be provided
through the recommended transfer from the FasTracks Contingency Reserve. Staff will investigate
additional funding sources to replenish the FasTracks Contingency Reserve at a future date.
Payment for each Rolling Stock Option Car shall be made by RTD to the Concessionaire in
accordance with the payment schedule noted in CA Section 31.1(i).
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee
that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to approve the purchase of six
Electric Multiple Units (EMU) vehicles for the North Metro Rail Line through the Denver Transit
Partners (DTP) Rolling Stock Option in accordance with the EAGLE Concession Agreement (CA)
Section 31.1, for an amount not to exceed $24 million. Funding to purchase two of the vehicles is
included in the 2013 Adopted Budget for the North Metro Corridor project.
It is further recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager to transfer $16 million from the FasTracks Contingency Reserve to
the North Metro Corridor project budget to fund the purchase of the additional four EMU vehicles.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Reconsider the North Metro Rail Line approach. This is
not recommended as RTD does not have another avenue to purchase EMU vehicles identical to
EAGLE Fleet. This alternative would delay operations from DUS to NWSS and negatively impact the
effective implementation of the FasTracks North Metro Rail Line.

Disposition Plan for Excess Land in Ft. Lupton,
Weld County

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors approve the
proposed Disposition Plan for excess land for the 80,173 square feet (1.84 acres) net of county road
right of way located at 13215 Weld County Road 8, Fort Lupton, Colorado and further authorize the
General Manager and/or his designee to negotiate and execute a contract for the sale of the property.
BACKGROUND
The Agreement Regarding Engineering Design and Railroad Property Acquisition by and between Union
Pacific Railroad Company and the Regional Transportation District dated January 25, 2007 contemplated
an acquisition of UPRR sites in Denver, Fort Lupton and Brighton and a relocation of UPRR to Weld
County. The Agreement provided that in order for the FasTracks Project to proceed on schedule and to
avoid delays, it would be necessary and desirable for the UPRR to purchase, or purchase options for,
certain Relocation Sites prior to the completion of negotiations on the Final Agreement between the
parties. Pursuant to the Agreement, RTD paid UPRR 100% of costs, fees and expenses incurred by
UPRR related to the identification of, due diligence on, and purchase and ownership of six properties in
Weld County and one property in Denver County. RTD determined that is was not feasible to proceed
with acquisition and relocation of UPRR facilities and therefore according to the terms of the Agreement,
UPRR assigned or transferred to RTD the properties at no additional cost to RTD.
Resolution No. 8, Series of 2008 Concerning the Sale of Property Acquired by the Regional
Transportation District from the Union Pacific Railroad was adopted by the RTD Board of Directors on
May 20, 2008 and provided that property acquired by the District from the UPRR pursuant to the
January 25, 2007 Agreement and not needed by the District for mass transit purposes would first be
offered to its original owners at the price paid by the UPRR plus direct expenses related to the transfer
of the property, and if not reacquired by the original owners on those terms would be marketed to obtain
the best price for the District. The owner of the property subject to this Board Action was notified of
the option to acquire the property back. The owner chose not to acquire the property at that time.
The subject property consist of a one story 3,688 square foot, single family residence which has been
substantially vandalized with two other vacant auxiliary houses and a small shed on 1.84 acres of
former residential property. Zoning of the property is I-2 (Heavy Industrial District) by the Town of Fort
Lupton.
DISCUSSION
An unsolicited offer to acquire was received on the property. An appraisal report was completed by an
independent appraiser, Sue Ann Foster, MAI, Foster Valuation Company LLC. Ms. Foster concluded an
opinion of the fair market value of the fee-simple interest in the subject property of $135,000 or 80,173
square feet at $2.25 per square foot ($180,389) less demolition costs of $45,000.

PROPOSED DISPOSITION PLAN: In accordance with Resolution No. 10, Series of 1984, Joint
Development and Disposition of Property Rights, the General Manager find that the RTD owned property
known as 13215 Weld County Road 8, Fort Lupton, Colorado Is not needed for transit use.
The appraisal report established a fair market value for the property. Mr. Robert Villano, Authorized
Manager of Villano Brothers Properties, Inc. represented by Mr. Peter G. Gunderson, Larry A. Cornell and
Mr. Bob Bruce, Esquire has agreed to enter into a Purchase and Sale Agreement for the appraised value.
The property will be sold “as is-where is”.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
RTD will receive the purchase price at closing. The proceeds will be assigned to the FasTracks Internal
Savings Account.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee
that the Board of Directors approve the proposed Disposition Plan for excess land for the 80,173
square feet (1.84 acres) net of county road right of way located at 13215 Weld County Road 8, Fort
Lupton, Colorado and further authorize the General Manager and/or his designee to negotiate and
execute a contract for the sale of the property.

Approval of Contract Extension - Geographic
Information Systems (GIS) Contract

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to award a month
to month contract extension to Idea Integration for an extension for the amount not to exceed of
$76,000 to provide Graphical Information Systems (GIS) consulting services. The contract is being
brought to the Board because it is a Personal Services contract per RTD Resolution No.27, Series of
1985.
BACKGROUND
The contract was awarded to Idea Integration in 2010 following a competitive bid of four submitted
proposals and candidate interviews. Idea Integration is a certified Environmental Systems Research
Institute's (ESRI) Corporate Consultant.
RTD provides mission critical GIS enterprise systems that must be maintained and continually enhanced.
GIS skilled consultants maintain the systems allowing 24x7 access to RTD’s critical GIS information
assets. These systems require ongoing maintenance and operations activities to ensure application
integrity and reliability. For example the GIS systems database contains the base maps used by the
Trapeze scheduling applications to plan all of RTD routes as well as for our new trip planner, parking
management, and CAD/AVL system. Without GIS development contract support, RTD would not be
able to operate and advance current public applications and systems.
DISCUSSION
This contracted support is critical for the on-going GIS administration of GIS System Map applications,
West Corridor Web Map, Internet Trip Planner, Parking Management System, FasTracks System Maps
and Trapeze interfaces. GIS will play a key role in establishing requirements for “real time” information
applications with the new CAD/AVL system. With an increase in GIS needs, this resource was approved
to be sourced as an internal employee. The contract provides a part time fixed level of weekly support
as well as 24/7 on-call resources to address critical failures until the new position is filled.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Cost to the District for the extension of contracted GIS services from Idea Integration for 600 billable
hours over a four-month period will not exceed $76,000. Sufficient funding has been included in the
Information Technology 2013 expense budget.
ALTERNATIVES

Packet Pg. 14

B.11.C

1. Approve the option to extend the contract for part time GIS Consulting Services. This is the
recommended action for the following reasons:
 Enables IT to maintain the current level of GIS Administration in support of Parking Management,
Internet, and Service Planning and Scheduling critical operations.
 Positions IT to move forward with required GIS applications to support future mobile and real time
applications, an improved trip planner, automated stop announcements, our new CAD/AVL
system, Fastracks and West Corridor GIS needs.
2. Do not approve the GIS Consulting Services part time contract extension. This is not the
recommended action for the following reasons:
 Capacity to adequately support the application production operations may be severely
compromised. RTD may need to reduce the 24/7 requirement for support.
 West Corridor on-line web maps would not be available to the public.
 Without key and unique skills that are not available through staff may possibly diminish the
functional performance level of the GIS and associated systems.
 Compromises the ability to configure new GIS systems and maintain compliance with GIS servers
for security and upgrades to the GIS development tools.
 Defer future upgrades and additional applications services until such time that IT can prioritize
current and future GIS project demands.

of Colorado at Boulder and adjacent business and residential areas. This agreement is for calendar year
2013 and is for an amount not to exceed $1,459,589.00.
BACKGROUND
The City of Boulder has funded and provided circulator bus service, known as the HOP, within the City
of Boulder since October of 1994. This service provides mobility and access to the commercial areas of
the city, the University of Colorado at Boulder, and adjacent business and residential developments.
RTD also provides extensive bus service to/from and within the City of Boulder. RTD and the City of
Boulder have worked together to assure that these services are complementary and work together to
provide attractive and effective transit service for people living, studying and working in the area.
The HOP currently operates from 7:00 AM to 10:00 PM on weekdays, from 9:00 AM to 10:00 PM on
Saturdays, and from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM on Sundays and holidays. In addition, Night HOP service is
provided and funded entirely by the University of Colorado. Currently, the HOP provides approximately
2,764 passenger trips per weekday.
DISCUSSION
RTD shall contribute funding to the City of Boulder to support the operation of the HOP in an amount not
to exceed $1,459,589.00 in 2013.
This Agreement will be for a period of one year. HOP performance will be assessed at the end of the
year to determine if performance expectations have been met and to determine if continuation of the cost
sharing agreement is warranted. Performance will be evaluated in terms of RTD’s service standards. If it
appears that service performance does not warrant continuation, RTD and the City of Boulder will confer
on modifications to the service in order to bring it into conformance. The provision of HOP service
through 3rd Quarter in 2012 resulted in 27.4 passengers per hour and an RTD subsidy per HOP passenger
trip of $1.62. The subsidy per passenger for RTD fixed route service in 2011 ranged from an average of
$2.62 subsidy per passenger for CBD local routes to an average of $7.12 subsidy per passenger for
suburban local service and an average of $4.96 subsidy per passenger for regional service.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for RTD support of the HOP service were included in the approved 2013 RTD budget. Nothing
herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this Agreement.

DRCOG Vanpool Agreement

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into an
Agreement with the Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) to provide RTD support and
expansion of the DRCOG RideArrangers vanpool program in the Denver metropolitan area. This agreement
is for calendar year 2013 and shall be in an amount not to exceed $730,000.00.
BACKGROUND
Vanpooling is a transportation option in which commuters/employees whose residences are
geographically clustered ride together to and from their work sites in a van that is driven and maintained
by one of the vanpool participants. Typically, the vans carry from six (6) to twelve (12) riders and are
provided by the vanpool program. Vanpools are organized to be sustainable and to render regular, ongoing service to vanpool members on a break-even, cost sharing, fare basis. Vanpools eliminate the costs
associated with dedicated drivers and expensive equipment.
As a transportation mode, vanpools provide personalized transportation at low cost and offer greater
opportunities for increased capacity as compared to carpooling. Vanpools also offer a cost-effective
alternative to conventional transit service in areas of low population density and longer commute
distances.
DISCUSSION
RTD has supported the DRCOG RideArrangers vanpool program since 2001. The vanpool program had
previously experienced limited participation due to perceived high fares, insufficient funding for van
acquisition, difficulties in recruiting drivers, and the lack of funding to support necessary marketing
activities. In order to help overcome these barriers, the RTD and the DRCOG entered into a partnership in
April of 2001 to expand vanpool service in the Denver metropolitan area. In doing so, RTD and DRCOG
believed that the organizations could make meaningful advances toward meeting shared goals of offering
desirable mobility options, reducing traffic congestion, and improving air quality in the Denver
metropolitan area. Benefits for RTD include substantial cost savings from avoidance and/or replacement
on marginal bus routes with vanpools. Benefits to both RTD and DRCOG include complementary
marketing programs and increased commuter transportation alternatives.
RTD financial support is used to help to underwrite the vanpool pricing structure in order to make vanpool
fares more competitive in the transportation marketplace. By subsidizing vanpool fares, vanpools are able
to compete with other transit alternatives and are perceived as a more attractive alternative for area
commuters. In addition, RTD support is used to provide incentives to attract and retain vanpool drivers
and to provide capital funding to acquire necessary rolling stock to provide vanpool services. Since the
advent of RTD support for the vanpool program in late 2001, the number of vans in service grew from 11
to 99 vans.

Packet Pg. 18

B.11.E

In 2009 the vanpool program became difficult to manage due to a shortage of DRCOG personnel.
DRCOG looked outside their agency at private companies currently operating vanpool services in other
metropolitan areas. After a competitive bid process, DRCOG choose VPSI to operate the vanpool
program. VPSI took over all operating aspects of the vanpool program. Over the next few years, VPSI
will phase out the DRCOG owned vehicles with leased vehicles. Since taking over the program the
number of vanpools has declined. Currently there are 97 active vans. The number of vanpoolers per
vehicle, however, has risen. In 2009, the vanpool program had a 63% capacity; in 2010, 93%; in 2011
and 2012 the number has stabilized to 81%. VPSI has held the vanpoolers more accountable in covering
costs of their individual vanpools. This in turn has resulted in more vanpoolers in each van.
DRCOG vanpool performance through the 3rd Quarter in 2012 resulted in an RTD subsidy per passenger
trip of approximately $1.87. The subsidy per passenger for RTD fixed route service in 2011 ranged from
an average of $2.62 subsidy per passenger for CBD local routes to an average of $7.12 subsidy per
passenger for suburban local service and an average of $4.96 subsidy per passenger for regional service.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for RTD support of the CRCOG Van pool program were budgeted in the approved 2012 budget.
Nothing herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this Agreement.
ALTERNATIVES
1.
Approve the financial support of the DRCOG RideArrangers vanpool service in order to continue
to provide and expand this transportation option for residents of the Denver metropolitan area
who work/commute in the Denver metropolitan area.
2.
Do not approve the cost sharing agreement. This course of action is not recommended as it may
result in a reduction to or elimination of the DRCOG RideArrangers vanpool program which would
result in an increase in single occupant commuting.

North Front Range Vanpool Agreement

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into an
Agreement with the North Front Range Metropolitan Planning Organization (NFRMPO) to provide RTD
support and expansion of the NFR VANGO vanpool program in the Denver metropolitan area. This
agreement is for calendar year 2013 and shall be in an amount not to exceed $425,000.00.
BACKGROUND
Vanpooling is a transportation option in which commuters/employees whose residences are
geographically clustered ride together to and from their work sites in a van that is driven and maintained
by one of the vanpool participants. Typically, the vans carry from six (6) to twelve (12) riders and are
provided by the vanpool program. Vanpools are organized to be sustainable and to render regular, ongoing service to vanpool members on a break-even, cost sharing, fare basis. Vanpools eliminate the costs

As a transportation mode, vanpools provide personalized transportation at low cost and offer greater
opportunities for increased capacity as compared to carpooling. Vanpools also offer a cost-effective
alternative to conventional transit service in areas of low population density and longer commute
distances.
DISCUSSION
RTD has supported the NFRMPO VANGO vanpool program since 2003. The program targets long
distance commuters who live in Northern Colorado and who travel to the Denver metropolitan area. Of
the vans in operation, 75% provide service in the RTD district. The RTD subsidy is based on vanpool
travel within the RTD district. The vanpool program had been limited by perceived high fares, insufficient
funding for van acquisition, difficulties in recruiting drivers, and the lack of funding to support necessary
marketing activities. In order to help overcome these barriers, the RTD and the NFRMPO entered into a
partnership in 2003 to expand vanpool service coming into the Denver metropolitan area. In doing so,
RTD and NFRMPO believed that the organizations could make meaningful advances toward meeting
shared goals of offering desirable mobility options, reducing traffic congestion, and improving air quality
in the Denver metropolitan area. RTD financial support is used to help to underwrite the vanpool pricing
structure in order to make vanpool fares more competitive in the transportation marketplace. By
subsidizing vanpool fares, vanpools are able to compete with other transit alternatives and are perceived
as a more attractive alternative for area commuters. In addition, RTD’s support is used to provide
incentives to attract and retain vanpool drivers and to provide capital funding to acquire necessary rolling
stock to provide vanpool services. In return for this funding NFRMPO provides RTD with National
Transportation Data. This data is included in the NTD numbers reported by RTD and used by the Federal
Government to determine the amount of federal funding allocated to RTD. Since the advent of RTD
support for the vanpool program in late 2003, the number of vans serving the Denver metropolitan area
has grown from 28 to 58 vans.

B.11.F

RTD shall contribute funding to NFRMPO to support the provision of the VANGO vanpool service in an
amount not to exceed $425,000.00 in 2013. NFRMPO vanpool performance through the 3 rd Quarter in
2012 resulted in an RTD subsidy of approximately $3.33 per passenger trip. The subsidy per passenger
for RTD fixed route service in 2011 ranged from an average of $2.62 subsidy per passenger for CBD
local routes to an average of $7.12 subsidy per passenger for suburban local service and an average of

Art Shuttle Cost Share Agreement

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into a Cost
Sharing Agreement with the City of Englewood to provide RTD financial support for the operation of the
art circulator bus service in the City of Englewood. This agreement is for calendar year 2013 and is for
an amount not to exceed $297,000.00.
BACKGROUND
In 2003 the City of Englewood applied for and received a Congestion Mitigation Air Quality (CMAQ)
Grant for a circular bus service. This grant was approved with funding available 2004-2007. CMAQ
funds were approved for 80% of the cost of the service. RTD contributed 10% of the expense and the
City of Englewood contributed 10%. The art shuttle was a free service. In September 2007, with the
expiration of the CMAQ grant, the RTD took over funding of the art shuttle. The City of Englewood
continues the management and marketing of the art shuttle. The City of Englewood covers all marketing
and related expenses. The art shuttle continues to be a free service that is sponsored by the City of
Englewood. The City of Englewood reimburses RTD for the fares that would have been paid if the art
shuttle charged a RTD fare.
The art shuttle currently operates from 6:30 AM to 6:30 PM on weekdays. There is no service on
Saturdays, Sundays or holidays. The shuttle operates between the Englewood light rail station and
Swedish Medical Center/Craig Hospital. The art shuttle operates as a free shuttle on a fifteen (15)
minute frequency. Ridership has averaged 843 boardings per day or 31.3 passengers per hour.
DISCUSSION
RTD shall contribute funding to the City of Englewood to support the operation of the art shuttle in an
amount not to exceed $297,000 in 2013.
This Agreement will be for a period of one year. The performance of the art shuttle will be assessed at
the end of the year to determine if performance expectations have been met and to determine if
continuation of the cost sharing agreement is warranted. Performance will be evaluated in terms of
RTD’s service standards. If it appears that service performance will not warrant continuation, RTD and
the City of Englewood will confer on modifications to the service in order to bring it into conformance.
The provision of art shuttle service through 3rd Quarter in 2012 resulted in 31.3 passengers per hour and
an RTD subsidy per art shuttle passenger trip of $1.31. The subsidy per passenger for RTD fixed route
service in 2011 ranged from an average of $2.62 subsidy per passenger for CBD local routes to an
average of $7.12 subsidy per passenger for suburban local service and an average of $4.96 subsidy per
passenger for regional service. The City of Englewood will continue to pay for all fares for the art
shuttle.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for RTD support of the art shuttle were included in the approved 2013 RTD budget. Nothing

Cost Share Agreements MAP 21 -5311

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into funding
agreements with Via Mobility of Boulder and the Seniors’ Resource Center to provide RTD financial
support for the provision of FTA Section 5311 (non-urbanized) services for Boulder County, Adams
County and Jefferson County. These Agreements are for calendar year 2013 and for amounts not to
exceed $335,298.00 for Boulder County, $300,000.00 for Adams County and $102,248.00 for
Jefferson County.
BACKGROUND
The Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU),
along with previous transit legislation, provides for the funding of transit services in non-urbanized, or
rural, areas. The section of the Act that addresses the provision of services in non-urbanized areas is
Section 5311 and thus these services are often referred to as “5311 service.” In 2013, SAFETEA-LU
provisions will be administered under the new Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP21). Since 1991, RTD has provided funding to various private, non-profit agencies to assist with the
provision of transit services in non-urbanized areas of the District and to provide local match money for
federal grant funds to support the provision of 5311 services in the District. RTD has provided financial
assistance for the provision of non-urbanized service in Jefferson County since 1991 and has provided
financial assistance for the provision of non-urbanized service in Adams and Boulder Counties since
1993.
DISCUSSION
RTD shall contribute funding to Via Mobility to support the provision of non-urbanized services in Boulder
County in an amount not to exceed $335,298.00 in 2013. RTD shall also contribute funding to Special
Transit to support the provision of non-urbanized services in Adams County in amount not to exceed
$330,000.00 in 2013.
RTD shall contribute funding to Seniors’ Resource Center to support the provision of non-urbanized
services in Jefferson County in an amount not to exceed $102,248.00 in 2013.
This Agreement will be for a period of one year. 5311 performance will be assessed at the end of the
year to determine if performance expectations have been met and to determine if continuation of the
funding agreements is warranted. Performance will be evaluated in terms of RTD’s service standards.
If it appears that service performance will not warrant continuation, RTD and the affected party(s) will
confer on modifications needed to bring it into conformance. The provision of 5311 service in 2012
(current numbers available) resulted in monthly performance that ranged from 1.9 to 2.2 passengers
per hour and an RTD subsidy per passenger boarding ranging from approximately $1.66 to
approximately $3.79 (subsidy reflects only the RTD contribution). RTD Call-n-Ride monthly
performance averaged 4.8 passengers per hour in 2011 while RTD Access-a-Ride service performs at
approximately 1.2 passengers per hour. Call-n-Ride performed at an average subsidy per passenger
boarding of $15.44 in 2011 while access-a-Ride performed at an average subsidy per passenger trip of

approximately $55.87 in 2011.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for RTD support of the 5311 services were included in the approved 2013 RTD budget. This
Agreement will be for a period of one year. Nothing herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this
Agreement.
ALTERNATIVES
1.
Approve the 5311 cost sharing agreements with Via Mobility and Seniors’ Resource Center so
that these organizations can continue to provide transit services to individuals in the nonurbanized, rural areas of Boulder, Adams, and Jefferson counties.
2.
Do not approve the cost sharing agreement. This course of action is not recommended as it may
result in a reduction to or elimination of transit services in the non-urbanized, rural areas of
Boulder, Adams, and Jefferson counties.

Contracted Fixed Route Services 2012 Year
End Budget Transfer

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize a budget transfer from the purchased transportation service and fuel line items of the “Group
21” budget to the “Group 23” budget to cover the variation in costs incurred as a result of adjustments
to service levels associated with runboard service changes in 2012. The total dollar amount of the
budget transfer is $350,000 ($200,000 for service, $150,000 for fuel).
BACKGROUND:
RTD currently contracts with two (2) different service providers, First Transit and Veolia
Transportation, to provide fixed route transit services under four (4) service contracts. First Transit
operates the “Group 20” (Commerce City), “Group 22” (Longmont) and “Group 23” (Denver) service
contracts. Veolia operates the “Group 21” service contract.
DISCUSSION:
Effective with the January 2012 runboard service changes, RTD Service Planning & Scheduling made
adjustments in the number of service hours in all of the private contract fixed-route service contracts
as a result of the District-wide reduction in service. The adjustments that were made to the Group
21 and Group 23 contracts resulted in a higher than expected increase in service hours in the Group
21 contract and a lower than expected decrease in the service hours in the Group 23 contract.
Consequently, Veolia (Group 21) was left scrambling to hire additional drivers and First Transit
(Group 23) was faced with the prospect of laying off drivers. RTD agreed to adjust service hours
with the May runboard to bring both contracts closer to service hours that should have been
implemented based upon the percent of overall service reductions that were made in January. At the
present time, the Group 23 service hours have been increased to a level slightly higher than the
hours used to estimate costs for the 2012 budget and the contract will run short of funding by the
end of the year. Conversely, the Group 21 service hours have been reduced below the level used to
estimate costs for the 2012 budget. Therefore, it is recommended that the excess budget dollars in
Group 21 be transferred to Group 23 to provide the additional funding needed for this service
contract for 2012.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
There is no financial impact. The Group 21 service contract currently has budgeted dollars available
to be transferred into the Group 23 service contract.
ALTERNATIVES:
1)
Approve the recommended action item so that funds will be available to pay invoices for
Group 23 service through the end of 2012.
2)
Do not approve the budget transfer. This course of action is not recommended as it will
require staff to locate additional sources for budget funding to pay invoices for Group 23
service.

Interactive Voice Response (IVR) System for
Paratransit and Fixed-Route Information

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into a contract for the development and
implementation of an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system for paratransit (Access-a-Ride) and fixedroute information with Enghouse Transportation LLC for a contract amount not to exceed $829,393.
BACKGROUND
The introduction of an Interactive Voice Response System (IVR) for both the Telephone Information
Center and Access-a-Ride began in part, to enhance the efficiency of the services provided by
simplifying business process integration, increasing flexibility, and providing efficiency gains in network
hosting. IVR is the technology that enables interaction between a caller and a computer via the
telephone. Callers can interact with IVR systems by pressing numbers on a telephone keypad or by
speaking simple commands to answer the computer's voice prompts. IVR technology is most commonly
found in the call centers of companies seeking to improve their customer service, reduce costs, and
expand their call center operations.
Enabled by the successful Proposer, and tightly monitored by RTD staff, IVR will provide:
Access-a-Ride
Intelligent call routing which will allow passengers to reach the right agent every time
Integration with internal application, RouteMatch, to improve call center operations
Expanded ability to get feedback from passengers with surveys that populate our database from the
proposed IVR solution
Reduce idle time in our call center with outbound campaign management
Automated response to “where’s my ride” inquiries
Next day trip reminders
Vehicle arrival reminders
Public announcements
Access-a-Cab processing
Telephone Information Center
Expand the Telephone Information Center’s ability to serve the Districts Customers by offering a texting
“MyStop” option to answer next bus questions.
Allow Customers to build an individual profile allowing easy access to the information they select.
Add a survey option that will allow RTD to query our Customers.
Comprehensive administrative tools and system reporting tools allowing us to maximize the IVR
functionality and to use the data collected to track system performance.

Packet Pg. 28

B.11.J

Include an advertising component to each text MyStop message allowing RTD to offer this service at no
cost to the Customer or RTD.
The advertising component could potentially develop into a revenue source for RTD.
The benefits of IVR are endless. RTD cannot remain competitive in terms of providing expected
customer service if we do not possess the tools our riders need. Other than on a case-by-case
exception, Access-a-Ride passengers have been advised that it is their responsibility to be ready for their
vehicle at the commencement of their 30-minute pick up window. One of the key benefits of the IVR
system will be the automated process of contacting passengers and giving them notice of the impending
arrival of their vehicle. This will eliminate the need for passengers to wait, sometimes at an
inconvenient location or outside, for up to 30 minutes for their vehicle to arrive. Not only will this
culminate in improved customer service, but it is highly probable that our on time performance will
benefit. Currently, the Access-a-Ride Call Center reserves, schedules, and dispatches over 2700
passenger trips each day. The telephone communications associated with these passenger trips
consume an extremely high amount of resources. The IVR, integrated with our scheduling software,
RouteMatch, will allow us to proactively manage our daily service delivery. The ability to automate
routine calls such as, “Where’s My Ride” inquiries, next-day trip reminders, vehicle arrival reminders, and
the automated processing of Access-a-Cab trips will provide Call Center personnel more time to deal
with calls requiring more detailed interaction. Conducting automated phone surveys will keep us abreast
of trends which may need modifying, and automated public announcements will help keep customers
better informed about Access-a-Ride service. The introduction of IVR to Access-a-Ride will be a
significant technological improvement to the program and will ultimately improve both efficiency and
customer service.
The Telephone Information Center (TIC) has used technology to assist the Customers of the District
while maintaining a static headcount. In 2002 the TIC received 2,289,535 calls. In 2012 the TIC had
its first 5,000,000 call year and 2013 will also exceed 5,000,000 calls. RTD’s existing IVR technology
has been a major contributor to this increase. The addition of a Texting capability will expand our ability
to provide information to our Customers and allow us to reach a new demographic who have grown up
with texting. It will provide operators more time to assist those Customers who have complex route and
scheduling inquiries by further reducing the next bus inquires received by the TIC.
We will also offer our Customers the ability to customize their IVR interaction by selecting a list of
favorites allowing them to ask for information for a stop that they have preselected or that the IVR has
recorded from their past call history.
Finally, the system will also have the ability to survey our callers giving us the ability to check the quality
of the service that our Customers receive when calling the TIC as well as allow RTD to query our
Customers on subjects that are important to us.
DISCUSSION
Three proposals were received in response to RFP 12FH002 for the Interactive Voice Response System
for Paratransit and Fixed-Route Information. Proposals were received from Enghouse Transportation
LLC, LogicTree Corporation, and Unified Dispatch (UDI). The proposals were reviewed by an evaluation
team that consisted of Joe Berdaus, Sr. Manager, Customer Information; Larry Buter, Manager,
Paratransit Services; Carolyn Conover, Sr. Manager, Contracted Services; Beverly Scott, Program
Manager, Information Technology; and David Terada, ITS Systems Administrator. The evaluative criteria
established for this procurement were 1) experience of the team and experience providing proven, similar
technologies (35%), 2) cost (35%), 3) demonstrated understanding of the project (10%), 4) project

Packet Pg. 29

B.11.J

approach, including proposed warranty/system support (10%), and 5) project implementation (10%). It
is the recommendation of the evaluation team that RTD award a contract for the IVR system for
paratransit and fixed-route information to Enghouse Transportation LLC.
The members of the evaluation team individually reviewed the technical proposals submitted by the
three proposers. Each team member evaluated the proposals on how well the proposal met the
evaluative criteria set forth for the procurement and assigned a score for “Experience”, “Understanding
of the Project”, “Project Approach” and for “Project Implementation.” Based on the average of the
individual scores received in these categories, LogicTree was the highest rated technical proposal
followed by Enghouse. UDI was the lowest rated technical proposal. The score for the “Cost” element
of each proposal was calculated by the RTD procurement staff and was then added to the technical
score of each proposal to determine the overall score or rating of each proposal. The total overall scores
resulted in Enghouse being the highest rated proposal followed by LogicTree. UDI was the lowest rated
technical proposal and the highest cost proposal. It was the consensus of the evaluation team that
Enghouse presented the best value for the District in terms of the combination of the technical proposal
and the proposed price.
RTD has required that the IVR system be fully functioning, tested and in operation within 180 days from
notice to proceed. Based on the timeline for approval and contract award, it is anticipated that the IVR
system will be operational no later than August, 2013.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The cost for the IVR system is $829,393, which includes hardware, installation and configuration. The
on-going operational costs, without the ad sharing, are approximately $28,000 (price per text based on
500,000/year). Funds for the IVR system are included in the 2012 capital budget. Future year
expenses will be budgeted as needed for on-going operational and maintenance costs in the Information
Technology budget.
A grant will assist in covering $496,925 of the proposed amount.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Award the contract to Enghouse Transportation LLC, as recommended.
2. Do not award a contract. Return the grant money and defer the project. Opportunity costs for
enhancing the rider experience will be deferred. Implementation costs may need to be fully
funded by RTD if grant money is not available in the future.
3. Develop the technology in house. The cost would be equal to or higher and would defer other
projects currently planned. The implementation would be pushed into 2014 or later.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: December 3, 2012

From:

Austin Jenkins, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

November 28, 2012

Board Meeting Date: December 13, 2012

Subject:

Award Contract to Supply Sixty-Five (65)
HVAC Units (Including Spares) to Replace the
Existing Units on the SD100 Light Rail Fleet.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is Recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager to award a sole-source contract to Siemens Industry, Inc. Rail Systems,
based in Sacramento, California to supply sixty-five complete HVAC units. These units will be used to
replace the units currently installed on the SD100 Light Rail Fleet.
BACKGROUND
The RTD currently operates forty-nine SD100 Light Rail Cars. This was the first model of vehicles
purchased in four orders for our light rail service. The refrigerant used in these HVAC units on the first
thirty-one vehicles is being phased out due to EPA regulation changes and will not be available for
purchase within the next few years. These units were built by another vendor and have been a
maintenance problem for quite some time including a fleet failure situation where Siemens stepped in to
honor the warranty that another vendor had rejected. This purchase will make all HVAC units the same
and will offer fleet wide component interchangeability and compatibility. Salt Lake City (UTA) replaced
similar ones within the first two years of operation.
DISCUSSION
We have received a very favorable quote from Siemens for HVAC, Frames and Inverter units, which
includes freight, for all sixty-five (65) not to exceed $4,615,000.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The funding for this contract is part of the 2013 budget.
DBE PARTICIPATION
There is no DBE requirement for this HVAC system procurement.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the General Manager to award a contract to Siemens Industry, Inc. Rail Systems to
build and supply sixty-five (65) HVAC units. This is the recommended alternative.
2. Do not authorize the award of the contract and solicit proposals. This is not desirable as it would
result in a substantial delay in the acquisition of the HVAC equipment may result in substantially
duplicated costs (R & D) since there are no other suppliers for these units.

GM
Board Meeting Date: December 13, 2012

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors direct staff
to move forward with implementation of the eight, highest value, recommended opportunities identified
as part of the Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM). Any funding realized through these activities will be tracked
separately and added to a new budget account, the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA). The
status of the FISA will be reported to the RTD Board of Directors on a monthly basis, and the FISA will
be incorporated into the FasTracks Strategic Budget Plan and Annual Budget. Expenditures from the
FISA will be subject to Board approval, with the staff recommended project goals identified below in the
Background section of this report confirmed as the current RTD Board project goals for the FISA.
Specifically, it is recommended that staff move forward with the following activities:
1. Beginning in 2014, increase FasTracks funding to support base system operations at the rate of
inflation as defined by the Consumer Price Index (CPI):
 Estimated to contribute $24 million to the FISA by 2017;
2. Reduce FasTracks Minimum Unrestricted Fund Balance once construction milestones have been
reached, the majority of the Eagle Project grant funding has been received and RTD has better
information on the growth of sales and use tax:
 Estimated to contribute up to $72 million to the FISA by 2017;
3. Reduce FasTracks Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Fund Balance from three to two months:
 Estimated to contribute $10 million to the FISA by 2017;
4. Defer Southwest Corridor Extension Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR) relocation – complete once
funding is identified for the entire project:
 Estimated to contribute $9 million to the FISA by 2017;
5. Work to achieve project underruns on FasTracks projects currently under contract:
 Estimated to contribute $15 million to the FISA by 2017;
6. Sell or lease RTD properties, where possible:
 Estimated to contribute $20 million to the FISA by 2017;
7. Request stakeholders to increase financial participation above the current level of 2.5%:
 Estimated contribution – To Be Determined;
8. Work with legislature to allow RTD to audit sales and use tax receipts and provide RTD with
parity with the State on sales tax exemptions (i.e., ensure exemptions are the same for both RTD
and the State in all cases). Establish this as RTD’s number one legislative priority. Begin working
immediately with government relations staff, lobbyists, legal counsel and other stakeholders to
initiate and support the introduction of a bill(s) on these topics during the 2013 legislative
session:
 Estimated to contribute up to $127 million to the FISA by 2017.

Approval of the opportunities listed above will have a positive impact to the FasTracks capital program
through the establishment of the FISA with a goal of achieving $300 million by 2017. It is anticipated
that these eight highest priority opportunities alone could fund the FISA up to or exceeding $277 million
by 2017. The Board directs staff to continue working to identify other funding opportunities through the
RAM analysis process in 2013 for potential Board consideration at a later date.
BACKGROUND
Over the last several months, RTD staff has developed a Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM) that identifies
specific cost saving/revenue enhancing opportunities that, if enacted, would result in additional nearterm funding for the FasTracks program (i.e., by 2017). For each of these opportunities, staff has
identified the associated level of risk to the District and presented this risk assessment to the RTD Board
on November 13, 2012 for their consideration. All funding identified through the process will be added
to the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) until enough funding is accumulated to complete and
operate additional projects. Staff has identified the following project goals for 2017, and this confirms
the RTD Board’s concurrence with these goals at this juncture:




Completion of US 36 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Project;
Construction of North Metro to at least 72nd;
Any remaining funds above the $300 million goal could leverage potential grants or private sector
contributions for FasTracks partially-funded projects (at the RTD Board’s discretion).

Ultimately, future RTD Board policy actions will be required to determine what projects will be funded,
and when, through the FISA.

DISCUSSION
On November 13, 2012, staff presented the eight, highest value, recommended opportunities identified
as part of the RAM. For each of these opportunities, staff identified an estimated contribution to the
FISA by 2017 and a level of risk. The following table summarizes the information presented to the RTD
Board in November:

In addition to the opportunities identified above, RTD staff has identified the following additional RAM
items that will be discussed with the RTD Board of Directors in the future:
 Aggressively pursue additional federal loans/grants and potential loans from public/private sector;
 Request stakeholders apply DRCOG financial commitment to base projects rather than
enhancements;
 Adjust frequencies/span of service on rail lines;
 Conduct life-cycle reviews to balance short-term capital and long-term O&M needs;
 Minimize scope changes once projects enter final design/construction.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Approval of the eight, highest value, recommended opportunities identified as part of the RAM will have
a positive impact to the FasTracks capital program through the establishment of the FISA. It is
anticipated that these opportunities could fund the FISA up to or exceeding $277 million by 2017.

Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not direct staff to move forward with
implementation of the eight, highest value, recommended opportunities identified as part of the RAM.
This alternative is not recommended because would not allow RTD to take advantage of these low to
medium risk opportunities that could result in additional funding for the FasTracks program of up to or
exceeding $277 million by 2017.

Conclusion
• Approval of the recommendations presented
in the Risk Allocation Matrix could fund the
FasTracks Internal Savings Account up to or
exceeding $277 M by 2017
• The Internal Savings Account would enable
RTD to begin implementing the following
projects by 2017:
– Completion of US 36 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Project
– Construction of North Metro to at least 72nd

General Overview Questions
• FAQ: What is the impact to the base system if there is a
significant economic downturn before 2017?
– The cost saving/revenue enhancing measures would have little to
no impact to RTD’s base system. The majority of the measures
apply only to FasTracks.
– Should a significant economic downturn occur that impacts the
base system, a future RTD Board could mitigate impacts to base
system operations through the following:
o Accessing management reserves to backfill the need, and
keeping the FISA whole.
o Transferring funds from the FISA to maintain base system
service levels (within the constraints of the FasTracks adopted
plan) and reducing the FISA accordingly.

Attachment: Board_Pres_12_4_12_RAM FAQS_FINAL (1406 : Filling the Internal Savings

B.12.L.b

• FAQ: Can RTD expend funds from the FISA prior to 2017?
– Future RTD Board policy actions will determine the timing and
purpose for withdrawing funds from the FISA.
o Funds for many of the measures are not assumed to be fully
available until 2017 (e.g., reducing the FasTracks Minimum
Unrestricted Fund Balance from $150 M).

– Staff recommends not withdrawing funds from FISA until accumulated
balance enables provision of a significant component of the short-term
project goals.

• FAQ: Will the FISA be included in the next SB 208
submittal to DRCOG?
– The financial plan provided with the SB 208 report will list FISA as a
fund balance account. The FISA will not be assumed to fund
additional projects until the RTD Board takes a formal policy action.

General Overview Questions
• FAQ: What impact will these measures have on the
DBE/SBE community?
– Enactment of these measures would benefit the DBE/SBE
community. Approval could fund additional FasTracks
projects up to or exceeding $277 M by 2017. Adding funds
to the FISA increases opportunities to receive additional
contracts with RTD to construct FasTracks projects.

• FAQ: What did the original FasTracks plan assume for
FasTracks funding of base system operations?
– The original 2004 FasTracks plan assumed an increase in base bus
service levels of 1% per year between 2006 and 2020 and 1.5% per
year between 2021 and 2025.

1. Evaluate FasTracks Funding for
Base System Operations
• FAQ: How much is the savings related to the total
funding for base systems operations?

– Over the five-year period, the cumulative reduction would be $24 M,
less than 1.5% of base systems operations. The transfer to the FISA
would be limited to that amount.
– The RTD Board always retains the option to suspend the allocation,
or to transfer previously allocated funds back to the base system.

• FAQ: Does this measure have a sunset? Will it remain in
effect through 2025 or some other date?
– The decision to adjust FasTracks allocation to base system
operations only defers the commitment in the short-term to
accelerate construction of additional FasTracks projects. The full
allocation will be restored to base system operations when
financially feasible.

• FAQ: What does “parity with the State” mean?
– RTD would request legislation to ensure that any items taxed by the
State of Colorado are also taxed by RTD. For example, Colorado
currently collects sales and use tax for sodas and candy, while RTD
is precluded from collecting these taxes.
– Treating RTD and the State of Colorado consistently would simplify
tax collection process for vendors and the Department of Revenue.

• FAQ: If RTD is successful in implementing this
measure, would it be applied retroactively?
– If approved, RTD would work closely with government relations
staff, lobbyists, legal counsel and other stakeholders to further refine
this measure, including specific timeframes of applicability, etc.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: December 13, 2012

From:

Richard F. Clarke Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

November 28, 2012

Board Meeting Date: December 13, 2012

Subject:

Resolution Regarding Easement Agreements
and Indemnification of Claims with Suncor
Energy (U.S.A.) Inc.

Resolution
RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors adopt
the attached resolution. The resolution authorizes the General Manager or his designee to negotiate
and execute two easement agreements with Suncor; one agreement that grants an easement to RTD
for the North Metro Rail Line (“NMRL”) project through Suncor property in Adams County (the
“Bridge Easement”) and another agreement that grants an easement to Suncor to construct a
pipeline in the RTD owned Boulder Industrial Lead (“BIL”) right of way (the “Pipeline Easement”).
The Bridge Easement requires RTD to waive sovereign immunity to the extent it may be applicable,
and to indemnify Suncor for claims arising out of RTD’s use of the Bridge Easement in an amount up
to $200 million and to purchase general liability insurance in that amount from the date of
commencement of construction of the bridge and to maintain it through termination of the Bridge
Easement. RTD would receive $10,000,000 from Suncor in exchange for the Pipeline Easement,
and would pay Suncor $836,420 for the Bridge Easement. This would result in net revenue of
$9,163,580 to RTD, which would be applied to the cost of expansion of the Commuter Rail
Maintenance Facility (CRMF) to accommodate the North Metro vehicles.
It is further recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Boa rd of Directors
authorize the transfer of $836,420 from the FasTracks Contingency Reserve for the acquisition of
the Bridge Easement. These funds would be replenished out of the $10,000,000 to be received
from Suncor in exchange for the Pipeline Easement.
BACKGROUND
In December of 2011, Suncor approached RTD with a request to purchase an easement from RTD to
be used for the installation of a new pipeline (the “Pipeline Project”). The Pipeline Project consists of
construction a 16-inch crude oil pipeline system, running from Wyoming to Commerce City, Colorado
and a 10-inch pipeline running for approximately 1,000-feet from Brighton Boulevard to East 66 th
Avenue in Commerce City.
In 2009, RTD purchased the Boulder Industrial Lead (BIL) from the Union Pacific Railroad for the
purpose of using the corridor to construct and operate the NMRL. Suncor would like to use a portion
of this right of way for the 10-inch and 16-inch pipeline. The requested Pipeline Easement would be
parallel to but lateral from the future NMRL tracks.
The Pipeline Easement is approximately 15 miles long and 20 to 30 feet wide, starting on the north
side within Section 36, Township 1 North, Range 68 West in Weld County and proceeds south to

Packet Pg. 87

B.12.M

Section 7, Township 3 South, Range 67 West in Adams County. The Pipeline Easement parallels the
NMRL from beyond the end of line station at 162 nd Avenue to south of the 72 nd Avenue Station, at a
minimum lateral distance of 25-feet away from the centerline of the nearest track which will not
interfere with the use and maintenance of the NMRL. The 10-inch pipeline is located in the south
end of our BIL right of way in an area not used by the NMRL.
RTD agreed to negotiate granting of the Pipeline Easement contingent on Suncor granting RTD the
bridge easement for the future NMRL that will run through the Suncor property on an elevated
structure requiring an aerial easement approximately 5300 feet long by 24 feet wide. RTD also
requested that Suncor include provisions for a gravel access road.
DISCUSSION
The price to be paid by Suncor for the Pipeline Easement is $10,000,000. The easement was
appraised by David B. Clayton, Certified General Appraiser for Suncor Energy Services, Inc. The
property was appraised under two valuation techniques, commonly known as Across the Fence and
Across the Fence Plus Corridor Enhancement Factor and is based on several “extraordinary
assumptions. The appraisal was reviewed for RTD by Integra Realty Resources, Houston, Texas and
signed by Michael W. Welch, Principal and Certified General Real Estate Appraiser, Brad Weiman,
MAI, Managing Director and John P. Baker, MAI. The review concludes that Mr. Clayton’s use of
the methodologies used is an acceptable means of valuation that is recognized by industry peers,
published treatise and acceptable standards and in general agrees that the value of the easement,
$4,031,930 is reasonable. Through negotiation, Suncor has agreed to pay $10,000,000 for the
pipeline easement and to make a onetime payment in the amount of $500,000 to be used toward
installation of the gravel access road.
Engineering plans for the Pipeline Project have been reviewed by RTD’s engineering staff to ensure
compatibility with the NMRL. Submittal of final plans is expected in December 2012. Final sign ing
of the Pipeline Easement is contingent upon final approval and acceptance of the Suncor’s
construction plans by the RTD engineering staff and final approval of the form and substance of the
Pipeline Easement Agreement.
The current estimated value of the bridge easement is $836,420 based on an appraisal prepared by
David B. Clayton for Suncor. The appraisal will be reviewed for RTD when received from Suncor.
Final signing of the bridge easement is contingent upon RTD review and acceptance of the appraised
value and final approval of the form and substance of the bridge easement Agreement.

As noted in the Resolution, the bridge easement requires RTD to waive sovereign immunity to the
extent it may be applicable, and to indemnify Suncor for claims arising out of RTD’s use of the
bridge easement. Suncor is also required to indemnify RTD for claims arising out of Suncor’s use of
the Pipeline Easement in an amount to be determined based on RTD risk management review. RTD is
required to maintain $200 million of passenger rail liability on its entire corridor due to federal and
freight railroad requirements and so will not be increasing its level of insurance cov erage to benefit
Suncor. Suncor has requested it be required to insure RTD at a level commensurate with its pipeline
coverage in other corridors.

B.12.M

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for the acquisition of the bridge easement is not presently included in the North Metro
budget since the bridge easement is part of the construction project from National Western Stock
Show to 72nd Avenue Station. The recommended budget transfer would provide funding for the
acquisition of the Bridge Easement, and would be replenished from the proceeds of the Pipeline
Easement when this easement is executed. In addition, the approval of this resolution would result in
a net gain of approximately $9,163,580 to the District. These funds will be applied to the cost of
expansion of the CRMF to accommodate the North Metro vehicles, as approved by the Board on
September 18, 2012.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee
that the RTD Board of Directors adopt the attached resolution. The resolution authorizes the
General Manager or his designee to negotiate and execute two easement agreements with
Suncor; one agreement that grants an easement to RTD for the North Metro Rail Line (“NMRL”)
project through Suncor property in Adams County (the “bridge easement”) and another
agreement that grants an easement to Suncor to construct a pipeline in the RTD owned Boulder
Industrial Lead (“BIL”) right of way (the “Pipeline Easement”). The bridge Easement requires RTD
to waive sovereign immunity to the extent it may be applicable, and to indemnify Suncor for
claims arising out of RTD’s use of the bridge easement in an amount up to $200 million and to
purchase general liability insurance in that amount from the date of commencement of
construction of the bridge and to maintain it through termination of the bridge easement. RTD
would receive $10,000,000 from Suncor in exchange for the Pipeline Easement, and would pay
Suncor $836,420 for the Bridge Easement. This would result in net revenue of $9,163, 580 to
RTD, which would be applied to the cost of expansion of the Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility
(CRMF) to accommodate the North Metro vehicles.
It is further recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the transfer of $836,420 from the FasTracks Contingency Reserve for the
acquisition of the Bridge Easement. These funds would be replenished out of the $10,000,000
to be received from Suncor in exchange for the Pipeline Easement.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not agree to adopt this resolution, do not grant
Suncor the Pipeline Easement and forgo the receipt of $10,000,000; do not acquire the
easement for the future NMRL until a future date when all funding for the construction of that
project is in place. This alternative would negatively impact the effective implementation of the
NMRL as well as the cost recovery for the CRMF.
