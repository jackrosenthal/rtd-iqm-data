Step 3 Develop and Evaluate Scenarios
DEVELOPING THE MOBILITY OF THE FUTURE
Consider COVID-19’s Impact on Reimagine RTD
• TWG and AC were asked: Does the impact of COVID-19 change your
perception of what success for RTD looks like? If so, how?
• TWG and AC were asked: How do you feel Reimagine RTD can be used to
maintain the relevance of transit through COVID-19?

• Long-term goal of Reimagine RTD doesn’t look different, but COVID-19 impacts the
short-term focus
• Focus on serving transit-dependent populations
• Consider potential long-term impacts to commute behavior/patterns post COVID-19
• Coordinate closely with local agencies and public health officials
• This is an opportunity for RTD to be flexible and innovative
• Funding is a critical element to consider in more detail
• Need to focus on getting riders to feel safe using transit

Near-term Priorities (During COVID Response)
• High Priorities:
• Service to equity populations
• Service to transit supportive land uses
• High-quality high-frequency service

• Low Priorities:

• Wide-spread service coverage
• Achieving a low cost (to RTD) per boarding metric

Mid-term Priorities (Beyond Immediate COVID Response)
• Similar priorities to the near-term but TWG has slightly more focus on achieving a lower cost per
boarding (cost to RTD not fares)
• RTD providing a regional backbone of service and supporting partnership where local
communities pay for/operate local service – the group stated that partnership may be more
viable beyond the immediate COVID response timeframe when funding levels are restored
• AC generally more strongly supportive of RTD providing a regional backbone of service with local
partnerships

2.A.1.a

• Provide a well-defined, high frequency rail and corridor-focused bus network
that serves as the “backbone” of the regional transit network
• Utilize existing RTD rail and bus transit center facilities as hubs that provide
connectivity between sub-regional and community routes and the regional,
high frequency network
• Develop a plan that is scalable, with phased implementation as demand and
available revenues improve
• Utilize ridership, demographic and LBS travel information to inform route
definition
• Embrace alternative service delivery approaches to provide lower cost
options for connectivity
