Board Meeting Date: July 15, 2014

Subject:

Approval to submit the RTD FasTracks
Projects for the DRCOG 2040 Regional
Transportation Plan (Baseline Report)

Resolution
RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors approve
the attached Resolution, which will permit staff to submit to DRCOG, by August 1, 2014, a Baseline
Report on FasTracks in conformance with DRCOG’s request for ongoing review of the FasTracks
Plan pursuant to C.R.S. 32-9-107.7 as outlined by DRCOG Resolution passed September 18, 2013.
FasTracks projects and project elements that will be completed by 2040, as described in this report,
will be included in the 2040 Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) currently being prepared by DRCOG.
BACKGROUND
This action supports and fulfills the General Manager Goals of Innovative, priority-based
FasTracks/SBP Funding because it capitalizes on available, project-specific funding sources to further
the build-out of FasTracks; and Continue Advancement of FasTracks because it moves RTD further
toward completion of the full FasTracks Plan.
In 1990, the Colorado Legislature approved C.R.S. 32-9-107.7 (SB 208), which requires that
DRCOG, as the Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO), approve the technology and the method
of financing for all RTD fixed guideway projects. Therefore, SB 208 applies to FasTracks and RTD
has submitted reports on FasTracks to DRCOG since 2004. In September 18, 2013, the DRCOG
Board passed a resolution requesting submittal of a Baseline Report on FasTracks by August 1,
2014. FasTracks projects that will be completed by 2040, as described in the Baseline Report, will
be included in the 2040 RTP that is currently being prepared by DRCOG. Inclusion in the RTP is
necessary for environmental clearance through the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and to
be eligible for receipt of Federal funding.
The Baseline Report will include a discussion of the following items:
 Project Definition/Scope (Project Description)
 Financial Plan (Costs and Revenue)
 Schedule
 Operating Characteristics
 Level of Bus Service
In May 2014, the RTD Board of Directors approved the 2014 Annual Program Evaluation (APE),
which included a comprehensive financial blueprint for all FasTracks capital projects completed,

1.C.1

underway, or planned through the year 2019. The Baseline Report will include a status report of all
FasTracks projects based on a completion schedule by 2040, rather than 2019; however, the only
change from the 2014 APE is in regard to the acceleration of the Southeast Rail Extension funding
and schedule, based on current financial assumptions, which include receipt of a Full Funding Grant
Agreement (FFGA) from the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) for the Southeast Rail Extension
and local funding contributions.
DISCUSSION
The RTD Board, in August 2012, approved an amendment to the 2035 RTP, which describes the
intent to apply for Federal New Starts funding to complete the Southeast Rail Extension. This was
followed by RTD submittal of an application to enter the FTA New Starts process and a request for
$92 million. RTD was granted entry into Project Development in April 2013 and a second submittal
(request to enter Engineering) is due to FTA in September 2014. It is necessary to include the
Southeast Rail Extension project in the 2040 RTP via the Baseline Report to DRCOG due August 1,
2014, in order to be eligible to make application to enter the Engineering phase of the New Starts
process and maintain eligibility to receive the requested $92 million. While the Southeast Rail
Extension Project is currently in the 2035 RTP, it is scheduled for completion in the 2030 – 2035
timeframe. The timeframe for project completion will be revised to 2015 – 2024 in the 2040 RTP,
pursuant to Board approval of this action. Any contract for Engineering work on the Project will be
submitted to the RTD Board for approval.
On June 13, 2014, RTD received a letter from public and private Southeast corridor stakeholders
signed by the City of Lone Tree, Coventry Development, Douglas County, and the Southeast Public
Improvement Metropolitan District, pledging a sizable commitment of $25 million in cash, and up to
$15 million in right-of-way (ROW), permits, and other in-kind contributions to complete the
Southeast Extension. This letter is attached. Below is an accounting of the anticipated project costs
and funding commitments based on the amount requested in Federal funds and the local
commitment.

FFGA funds are unrelated to the Highway Trust Fund (HTF). Therefore, current challenges faced by the HTF
have no direct impact on Southeast Rail Extension New Starts eligibility or funding stream.

CMAQ = $7.5 Million in Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Funds (CMAQ) represents the
Southeast Rail Extension allocation of the DRCOG $60 Million Commitment in Principle to all FasTracks
projects.

Local Stakeholder contributions could be as high as $15 Million. The ROW component, which is calculated for
Federal purposes, is $9.2 Million.

Packet Pg. 5

1.C.1

Revising the Southeast Rail Extension schedule in the RTP positions RTD to leverage both Federal
and Local Stakeholder dollars to complete a component of the FasTracks Program. This is consistent
with our guiding principles, which include maximizing outside funding sources to complete
FasTracks. As noted above, the RTD contribution would be 35.5% of the cost to complete the
project, while the Federal and Local Stakeholder contribution equals 64.5%. The Local Stakeholder
contribution of 16.5% of project costs far exceeds the 2.5% required local match, and represents
the largest local commitment, by percentage of project costs, made to any FasTracks corridor.
Note that this action is a precursor to construction and that additional Board action, such as
approval of a construction contract, will be necessary prior to construction.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for this project would be provided through a combination of federal grants, local stakeholder
contributions, and previous and future commitments of RTD FasTracks funds. A separate Board action
would be required to authorize the additional $65.6 million in project funds that have not been
committed from other sources.
The inclusion of the Southeast Rail Extension in the Baseline Report will not affect the planned
financing or construction schedule for other FasTracks projects. The federal FFGA funding and local
stakeholder contributions are not available for RTD to use on any other FasTracks corridors.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee
that the RTD Board of Directors approve the attached Resolution, which will permit staff to
submit to DRCOG, by August 1, 2014, a Baseline Report on FasTracks in conformance with
DRCOG’s request for ongoing review of the FasTracks Plan pursuant to C.R.S. 32-9-107.7 as
outlined by DRCOG Resolution passed September 18, 2013. FasTracks projects and project
elements that will be completed by 2040, as described in this report, will be included in the
2040 Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) currently being prepared by DRCOG.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not approve the attached resolution, which
would permit staff to submit to DRCOG, by August 1, 2014, a Baseline Report on FasTracks
in conformance with SB 208 and as outlined by DRCOG Resolution passed September 18,
2013; would leverage Federal funds and local dollars; would utilize a 16.5% match from the
local stakeholders; and would further the completion of the FasTracks Program.

RESOLUTION No. ____
SERIES OF 2014
APPROVAL TO SUBMIT THE RTD BASELINE REPORT TO DRCOG ON
FASTRACKS
Whereas, in 1990, the Colorado Legislature passed C.R.S. 32-9-107.7 that provides for the
approval by the metropolitan planning organization, the Denver Regional Council of Governments
(DRCOG), of the method of financing and technology for any component part or corridor of a regional
fixed guideway mass transit system.
Whereas, to assure conformity with any changes in the FasTracks plan since DRCOG gave its
approval for those elements in 2004, DRCOG, on September 18, 2013, resolved to request submittal of an
RTD Baseline Report to document the status of the FasTracks Plan.
Whereas, projects and project elements that will be completed by 2040, as described in the RTD
Baseline Report, will be included in the 2040 Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) and thus will be
included in studies to confirm regional air quality conformity, which is necessary for receipt of National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) approval and eligibility for available Federal funding.
Whereas, the RTD Baseline Report includes information on the project definition/scope (project
description including the technology), financial plan (costs and revenue and method of financing),
schedule, operating characteristics, and level of bus service, which will document the status of the
FasTracks Plan.
Whereas, the Baseline Report is documentation of progress made and current status as a result of
previous RTD Board of Director decisions, with the exception of the schedule for completion of the
Southeast Rail Extension, which is revised to open in 2019. Correspondingly, the change in financial plan
from assumptions made prior to 2012 now assumes the receipt of a Federal Transit Administration (FTA)
Full Funding Grant Agreement (FFGA) in the amount of $92 Million and Local Stakeholder contribution
of $34.2 Million. With $207.4 Million required to complete the project, the additional RTD commitment
is $65.6 Million, or 35.5% of the costs to complete the Southeast Rail Extension Project.
Whereas, adjusting the Southeast Rail Extension schedule and its inclusion in the RTP is
necessary to maintain eligibility for the Federal funds requested and to be able to utilize the Local
Stakeholder contribution, which will facilitate construction of the Southeast Rail Extension Project and
move forward the completion of the FasTracks Plan, a regional transit system.
Whereas, future Board action will be required prior to the construction of the Southeast Rail
Extension Project.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that:
The RTD Board of Directors will permit staff to submit to DRCOG, by August 1, 2014, an RTD
Baseline Report on FasTracks in conformance with C.R.S. 32-9-107.7according to the DRCOG
Resolution passed September 18, 2013. FasTracks projects and project elements that will be completed by
2040, as described in this report, will be included in the 2040 RTP.

Passed and adopted by the Board of Directors of the Regional Transportation District on
the 15th day of July, 2014.

From:

Richard F. Clarke, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

Board Meeting Date: July 15, 2014

Subject:

Approval of Construction Contract for the
Central Park Station PnR & Bus Transfer Center

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommend by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the
General Manager, or designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into a construction contract
with M.A. Mortenson Company in the amount of $10,899,258.23 for the construction of the Central
Park Station Park-n-Ride and Bus Transfer Center, which will serve the East Rail Line Central Park
Station, regional and local buses and the local neighborhood. Funding for this project is included in the
2014 Amended Budget for the Eagle Project and the non-FasTracks capital project for the Stapleton
Park-n-Ride replacement.
BACKGROUND
This action supports the General Manager’s Task Goal to “Continue advancement of FasTracks,”
because this project will enhance multi-modal commuter connectivity to the East Rail Line train, regional
and local buses, bicycle access and vehicle parking with an RTD owned Park-n-Ride (PnR).
When DIA opened in 1995 and Stapleton International Airport (SIA) closed, RTD began operating a Bus
Transfer Center and PnR at the previous SIA parking area. Both surface and covered parking were
provided through a license agreement between RTD and the City & County of Denver. During August
2010, the Stapleton PnR was relocated to an interim asphaltic-gravel surface lot located near East 36th
Ave. & Central Park Blvd. The site provides surface parking for approximately1500 spaces. Bus service
for eleven (11) routes is near the PnR on E. 36th Ave. between Ulster and Central Park Blvd.
During 2001, RTD received a CMAQ grant to acquire property and complete an environmental clearance
for the proposed relocation of the SIA PnR/Bus Transfer Center. Environmental clearances were initiated
for the new permanent site on Smith Rd. just west of Central Park Blvd. Several concept designs were
prepared and coordinated with the City and County of Denver and Stapleton neighborhood developer.
In July 2010, RTD signed an IGA with Park Creek Metro District (PCMD) and Forest City Stapleton, Inc.
for acquisition, design and construction of public infrastructure capital improvements. Approximately
50% of the identified PnR site was acquired in late 2011. In the spring of 2012, a finding of “no further
action” was received for the environmental cleanup. RTD then acquired the remaining property in July,
2012, for the balance of needed property (approximately 20 acres). The PnR will be located on three
individual blocks that are separated by public Right-of-way. RTD and PCMD amended the IGA three
times as follows:
1. Early traffic signal and intersection design at Smith Rd. & Ulster St. for EAGLE PUC applications;
2. Implement final design of public infrastructure improvements such as utilities and access roads;
3. Construction funding of the public infrastructure that is adjacent to RTD’s new PnR site.

Packet Pg. 25

1.C.2

RTD has participated in a number of public outreach meetings and provided extensive coordination with
affected stakeholders including the City and County of Denver, the Park Creek Metro District, Stapleton
United Neighbors community, and Forrest City Stapleton.
DISCUSSION
The project is shown on the attached presentation. It is located on three individual blocks, bound by
Smith Road on the north, 37th Place on the south, Central Park Blvd. on the east and Trenton St.
(Walmart) on the west. The project will provide connectivity to the East Rail Line’s Central Park Station
and includes 1500 surface parking spaces and a 12 bus bay transfer facility. The parking area includes
ADA parking, motorcycle parking, and Kiss-n-Ride parking. The 12 bus bay transfer facility will have 4
bus passenger loading/unloading platforms, each with 3 gates, and overhead canopies which represents
the “Industrial Loft” architecture style of the commuter rail station. The design features include site
lighting, wind screens with functional art showing local native species, benches, trash receptacles,
passenger way finding and information displays, bike racks and lockers.
The bus transfer facility will also provide room for RTD Access-a-Ride vehicles, private hotel shuttles,
and will also include drivers relief stations. The project is designed with sustainable measures such as
low water landscaping, snow infiltration basins, and high efficiency LED lighting. In addition, the site
will accept a solar photovoltaic array in the future if or when funding becomes available. Safety &
security elements are incorporated in the project with the placement of emergency telephones, with
security camera and the underground infrastructure to easily allow for placement of approximately 100
security and parking management surveillance cameras throughout the PnR. The site will satisfy all ADA
accessibility and parking requirements.
With approval of this award recommendation, construction is anticipated to begin during August 2014
and a contract milestone to complete the bus transfer center and two of the three parking lots (842
spaces) has been established for July 15, 2015. A second milestone of Oct. 31, 2015 requires
completion of the third, west most, parking lot (658 spaces). The construction IFB was released on May
21, 2014 and included a Disadvantage Business Enterprise (DBE) goal of 27%. This recommended
contract has proposed a 31.93% DBE value. On June 19, 2014 RTD received and opened two (2) bids,
as shown below:
1. Mortenson
2. Krische

$10,899,258.23
$12,151,021.43

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for this project is included in the 2014 Amended Budget for the Eagle Project and the nonFasTracks capital project for the Stapleton Park-n-Ride replacement. The funding is allocated as follows:
Eagle Project
Non-FasTracks Capital
Total

$6,222,574.09
$4,676,684.14
$10,899,258.23

ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommend by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or designee, to execute all documents
necessary to enter into a construction contract with M.A. Mortenson Company in the amount of
$10,899,258.23 for the construction of the Central Park Station Park-n-Ride and Bus Transfer
Center, which will serve the East Rail Line Central Park Station, regional and local buses and the

Packet Pg. 26

1.C.2

local neighborhood. Funding for this project is included in the 2014 Amended Budget for the
Eagle Project and the non-FasTracks capital project for the Stapleton Park-n-Ride replacement.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action and do not construct the Central Park Station PnR. This
is not recommended as this PnR is providing a substantial parking component for the East Rail
Line and also provides a major passenger transfer facility for our current base system bus routes.
This would jeopardize the continued use of the interim parking lot, which is available by lease to
RTD only until the end of August 2015.
3. Delay implementing the Recommended Action. This is not recommended because the
construction costs are anticipated to increase as the overall economy continues to improve.
Delays would jeopardize the current bid, which is valid for only 60 days after its opening. Also,
delaying this action may create a timing issue for the existing PnR and bus transfer facility that is
operating on leased property that is currently scheduled to terminate at the end August 2015.
