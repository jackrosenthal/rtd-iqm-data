Date:

Subject:

Lamar Transit Adjusted MAG for 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Communications and Government Relations Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors revise the Minimum Annual Guarantee [MAG] to be received by RTD from Lamar Transit. Due
to impacts of COVID 19, the Committee recommends a net revised revenue guarantee of
$1,085,030.00 for 2021.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Mission-Oriented Goal #3: Strong Financial Management
Strategic Priority #6: Move RTD Toward Stable Financial Situation
BACKGROUND
Prior to the onset of COVID 19, RTD exercised a one-year extension for on-vehicle advertising services
with Lamar Transit, extending their period of performance to December 31, 2021. This period of
extension provides RTD with time to complete the preparation and selection of a vendor for the agency’s
enhanced approach to System Advertising. This approach will add digital customer information and
advertising opportunities to the existing on-vehicle advertising services. At the time of the notification,
all revenue parameters were unchanged. With the onset of COVID 19 and the extensive changes to
workplaces, travel and commuting, Lamar experienced significant cancellations and deferrals of
advertising contracts, and thereby, significant reductions in advertising revenue in 2020.
DISCUSSION
The Minimum Annual Guarantee [MAG] for 2020 was paid to RTD at the beginning of 2020 in the
amount of $3,400,000.00. Over the course of discussions with Lamar Transit, RTD and Lamar arrived
at applying the percentage of reduced service to a reduction of the MAG for 2021. RTD utilized a factor
of 60% of our pre-pandemic service level for the purpose of adjusting the revenue guarantee. The 2020
MAG credit and 2021 MAG reduction include two elements which account for the following:
(1) reduced service in 2020 and
(2) anticipated 60% service levels in 2021
The 2021 adjusted MAG of $1,085,030.00 was calculated in the following manner:
1) Credit for Reduced Service in 2020:
• MAG Revenue for 2020: $3,400,000 / 366 days = $9,289.62/day
• MAG Revenue per day @ 60%: $9,289.62/day x .6 = $5,573.78/day
•

Pandemic service plan began on April 19, 2020
o Jan. 1 – April 18 = 109 days @ 100 % service level
▪ 109 days x $9,289.62 per day = $1,012,568.58 (MAG at 100% Service
Level)

2) Revised MAG for 2021:
• $3,400,000 x 60% = $2,040,000 (adjusted MAG accounting for 60% service levels for
2021)
• $2,040,000 (adjusted 2021 MAG) - $954,970 (2020 credit) = $1,085,030.00
Adjusted MAG for 60% service level

REVISED 2021 MAG

$2,040,000 $954,970

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The proposed adjusted MAG for 2021 is $1,085,030.00, a $2,314,970.00 reduction in anticipated
revenue. The revenue sharing agreement between RTD and Lamar will continue, which is established as
a 60:40 revenue split once advertising sales exceed the baseline amount to trigger additional revenue
sharing. This adjusted revenue projection has been accounted for in the 2021 budget.

Salaried Employee Trustee Appointments

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approves the attached Resolution No. ______ reappointing Sylvia Francis and William Weidenaar to a
term expiring December 31, 2022 and appoints Bob Broom and Peggy Catlin from the Board of Directors
to a term expiring December 31, 2022 as Trustees for the Salaried Employee Defined Benefit (i.e.,
Pension) Plan and Salaried Employee Defined Contribution Plan.
GM Goals
Mission-Oriented Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management
BACKGROUND
On January 8, 2008, the RTD Board of Directors adopted Resolution No. 1 Series of 2008 providing that
a screening committee composed of the Board Chair, the Chair of the Salaried Employee Pension Trust
Fund and the Finance Chair (i.e., Chair of the Finance Administration and Audit Committee) will screen
applications from the middle management salaried employee class and the senior management salaried
employee class and will bring recommendations back to the Board.
In 2010, Resolution No. 27 made modification to state that, “for reappointment of Trustees who have
served satisfactorily and in whose education the Trusts have made substantial investments, it is not
necessary to seek applications for renewal, and instead the application process established by the RTD
Board of Directors in 2008 will be used on those occasions when the Board finds it necessary or
appropriate to appoint new salaried Trustees to the Trusts.”
On May 31, 2016, in Resolution No. 008 Series of 2016, the RTD Board of Directors amended the
Pension Trust and the Defined Contribution Trust, to end the “senior” and “middle” management
distinction, and instead authorized the Board of Directors to appoint two employee Trustees who
participate in the Pension Plan and two who participate in the Defined Contribution Plan, in addition to
the two Board members who are appointed to the Trusts and the Chief Financial Officer who is a
permanent member of the Trusts, to serve as the same set of Trustees on both of the Trusts.
Sylvia Francis’ and William Weidenaar’s current terms expire on December 31, 2020. Both Ms. Francis
and Mr. Weidenaar meet the criteria from Resolution No. 2017, Series 2010 for reappointment.
In
addition, both Board of Director appointments to the Trusts expire on December 31, 2020. The Chair of
the RTD Board of Directors appoints Director Bob Broom and Director Peggy Catlin as Trustees.

Board Meeting Date: December 15, 2020

Subject:

Budget Transfer for Commuter Rail Third Party
Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
approve budget transfers totaling $3.122 million from the North Metro operations budget to the Eagle
operations budget for third party reimbursable projects to allow RTD to compensate Denver Transit
Partners (DTP) for costs it will incur for work associated with third party agreements.
This action addresses two of the General Manager’s goals for 2020:
Mission-Oriented Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services
Mission-Oriented Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management
BACKGROUND
Since the T-Rex project, RTD has worked with third party partners, including stakeholders, local
governments, and private entities, on betterments associated with its construction projects. These
betterments have included enhancements to RTD rail lines and facilities or adjacent areas beyond the
original construction plans and concurrent construction of associated facilities for third parties. The third
parties requesting the work reimburse RTD for all costs associated with these betterments, so these
betterments are done at no net cost to RTD.
With the opening of the Eagle P3 commuter rail lines, RTD also has seen service impacts from third party
construction projects that require access to the right-of-way. These could include utilities that pass
under the track, or construction on bridges over the track. In these instances, DTP may be required to
provide access to the track or to modify service and incur the associated costs to allow the third party
construction to proceed in a safe and timely fashion.
The Concession Agreement between RTD and DTP requires that RTD reimburse DTP for costs incurred
related to third party projects. RTD, in turn receives reimbursement from the third party resulting in zero
net cost to RTD. This process occurs because RTD is the owner of the alignment while DTP is
responsible for operations. Under the Concession Agreement, any changes, such as payment for third
party work, to monthly scheduled availability payments to DTP for providing service and capital
financing, are negotiated and agreed to with RTD. These changes in payments are called Memorandums
of Relief (MORs).

DISCUSSION

12.C

Under RTD’s budgetary controls, budget transfers exceeding the General Manager’s authority must have
Board approval. These budgetary controls ensure the integrity of the budget appropriation process and
that budgeted funds are used for their intended purposes. However, there are some unforeseen and/or
unquantifiable activities, such as third party projects, that arise after the budget has been approved by
the Board which necessitate an appropriation for expenditures through a budget transfer.
RTD currently has several open third party projects that impact operations on the Eagle P3 alignment and
necessitate payment to DTP for costs incurred. These impacts include construction of the actual
betterments, provision of flaggers to ensure safety along the corridor for third party construction, power
shutdowns at the locations of the improvements, and relocation of utilities within the right of way.
Examples of some of these open third party projects include modifications by the Park Creek Metro
District at Central Park, construction work by SEMA Construction at Smith and Dahlia, the Mountain
Gateway Development Project, glass replacement and sign removal by DIA, etc. This budget transfer
will allow RTD to pay its current and future invoices on these open projects, and allow RTD, DTP, and
the third party partner entities to continue work on these projects in a timely manner.
It is important to note that these transfers only cover existing agreements with third party partners. Any
future new agreements will require additional budget revisions and Board approval.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There will be no net financial impact to RTD because RTD will be reimbursed by third parties for all costs
incurred on their behalf. In addition, this budget transfer will move existing approved 2020 budget
funds from the North Metro project to the Eagle P3 cost center.

Contributions to the FasTracks Fund Balance

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
redirects certain future funding sources (detailed below) from being deposited in the FasTracks Internal
Savings Account (FISA) and instead be deposited in the FasTracks unrestricted reserve for future
shortfalls in operations and maintenance costs.
This action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Mission-Oriented Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services
Mission-Oriented Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management
BACKGROUND
In 2012, the RTD Board of Directors created the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA). At that
time, the Board directed certain funds to go into the FISA reserve to build funding for future FasTracks
capital projects. Since that time, contributions have been made in accordance with that direction.
DISCUSSION
In October and November 2020, staff presented information to the Board that shows that it is doubtful
that FasTracks will be financially solvent over the next six years and beyond without utilizing all of the
existing reserves and future “rubber tire” contributions. Even with these funding sources, it is projected
that FasTracks revenues will be less than what is required to operate existing lines.
Allowing the use of the following estimated future anticipated funding sources to be used for FasTracks
operations and maintenance rather than adding them to the FISA reserve will help to offset the
anticipated shortfalls that are anticipated in the future.

and mitigate the size of the drawdowns of reserves.

CRL Associates Final Option Year

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Communications and Government Relations Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager or her designee to enter into an agreement for Local
Government Liaison Services with CRL Associates, Inc. (CRL) to exercise the second one-year option
(January 1, 2021 through December 31, 2021) to extend Contract No. 16-DO-025, at a cost of
$94,500. Funding for this contract is included in the 2021 budget.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #5 –Effective Communications & Community Outreach
BACKGROUND
In September 2016, RTD issued a Request for Proposals for Local Government Liaison Services. Eight
potential bidders reviewed the RFP, but only one responded to this request. The procurement panel
recommended to the Communications and Government Relations Committee the selection of CRL
Associates, Inc. as RTD’s Local Government Liaison. The firm serves as a liaison with the elected
officials and staff of the cities and counties of the Denver metropolitan area, as well as the business
community and economic development organizations. This team has broad knowledge of RTD, its
history, programs and issues, as well as an extensive network of relationships with local government
entities, elected officials, and key stakeholders along the Front Range. The proposal was submitted for
the period of January 1,2017 through December 31,2019, with the potential for two (2) one-year
options. The Communications and Government Relations Committee has made annual recommendations
to the Board of Directors at the end of each contract period regarding the exercise of future option
periods. This action relates to the second option year of this contract, which reflects a reduced rate. The
contractor willingly offered to reduce their contract amount by 10% given the agency’s financial
challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This is the final option year within the current contract, so
RTD would need to issue a Request for Proposal for Local Government Liaison Services beyond 2021.
DISCUSSION
CRL Associates, Inc. as RTD’s Local Government Liaison maintains contact with the local elected
officials and staff in the Denver metropolitan area, as well as the business community and economic
development organizations on matters related to RTD. This team has capably represented RTD’s local
government interests and matters with elected officials and key stakeholders in the Denver metro region
and has been an effective strategic partner in the agency’s local stakeholder coalition building.
As part of the Local Government Liaison Services, frequent contact will be made with RTD staff and
board members to ascertain a coordinated plan to monitor and report on activities at the city and county
levels of government. In addition, as part of the coordinated plan, CRL will provide regular outreach to
the business community and economic development organizations in the metro area to develop
partnerships and garner feedback on RTD issues. CRL will join RTD staff at local government meetings
and provide professional advice, counsel, and analysis of issues regarding local government activities as

they relate to RTD. CRL will also continue to provide liaison services in the implementation of the RTD
Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC).
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for the second option year ($94,500) are included in the 2021 annual budget.

Approval of Contract Extension for Jacobs
Engineering for FasTracks Program Support
Consulting Services

General

Board Meeting Date: December 15, 2020

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager to approve a contract amendment to Jacobs Engineering for
Program Support Consulting Services (PSC) for FasTracks, to extend the contract completion date from
December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021, with no change to the contract not-to-exceed amount.
Funding for this contract is included in the 2021 Adopted Budget for the FasTracks capital program in
the specific projects where PSC support would be utilized.
This Recommended Action supports the following General Manager’s goals:
Mission-oriented Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services
2021 Strategic Priority #4: Increase Ridership, Improve Rider Experience
BACKGROUND
On May 24, 2005, the RTD Board approved selection and award of a multi-year contract to CarterBurgess (later purchased by Jacobs Engineering) for Program Support Consulting Services at an initial
2005 Contract amount of $2,360,000, and a Notice to Proceed of July 5, 2005. The RTD Board
approved subsequent contract amendments through June 30, 2017 that brought the Contract Not-toExceed price up to $191,423,336.
In May 2017, the Board extended the contract completion date to December 31, 2019 without
increasing the contract price. At that time, the contract was amended to cover specific named
individuals and functional areas, with projected timeframes of availability for each one. In December
2018, the Board extended the contract completion date to December 31, 2020, and increased the
contract not-to-exceed amount to its current value of $192,623,336. This contract amendment would
not increase the contract value beyond the current authorized amount. Due to the hand-over of the NLine in September of this year, the additional work on the SERE project and final as-builds from the Eagle
and I-225, the survey and property effort had to be postponed until the completion of these activities. At
this time Jacob’s surveying and property team is completing needed record documents, survey and final
property transfer documents for the projects outlined below.
The PSC team provides program management support and specialized technical staff support to augment
RTD FasTracks Team staff. This approach adds value, cost-effectively, by allowing RTD to tap the PSC’s
specialized resources in planning, environmental, design, engineering, construction management support,
program control, and related disciplines on an as-needed, often part-time, basis.

Packet Pg. 62

13.F

DISCUSSION
The Program Support Consultant Contract originally was specified for a term of six years with a six-year
option, to be negotiated annually for the upcoming year’s work tasks. In December 2018, the contract
end date was extended to the current end date of December 31, 2020.
RTD has reached the stage of the FasTracks program where all the ongoing corridor projects have
reached revenue service and are in the closeout phase. At this time, it is crucial to finalize the
transactions and mapping that will secure the right-of-way for the program alignments, including survey
and mapping support for final acquisitions and utility relocations, post-construction surveys, and filing of
right-of-way plans. The proposed time extension to the Jacobs contract would make the resources
available to RTD to complete the project closeout in a timely and cost-effective manner.
The contract extension will cover specific named individuals and functional areas, with projected
timeframes of availability for each one. In the event that a named individual was to leave Jacobs before
the end of the contract timeframe, the contract would be amended to remove all remaining hours for
that individual.
The contract extension identifies the following specific functions and tasks in support of FasTracks:
Program Management
• Assist RTD in coordinating the overall program-wide and project mapping, right-of-way (ROW), and
utility survey for all corridors and facilities.
North Metro
• Perform mapping, survey and right-of-way support.
I-225
• Provide mapping, survey and right-of-way support.
Southeast Rail Extension
• Provide mapping, survey and right-of-way support.
Eagle P3 (East, Gold, CRMF, Northwest Rail Electrified Segment)
• Provide field survey, mapping, and right-of-way management support.
RTD has established a 7% DBE goal for this Contract. The DBE report through September 2020
indicates that the PSC’s actual cumulative DBE percentage has been 18.94%. RTD does not foresee
any additional opportunities for DBE subcontracting through this contract extension because all of the
named roles are filled by Jacobs employees. If RTD were to spend the full Contract Not to Exceed
amount, the DBE participation on the overall contract would be approximately 18.6%.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The total Contract Not to Exceed Amount for the PSC contract from 2005 through 2021, would remain
at the currently authorized amount of $192,623,336 with this amendment. Funding for the remainder
of this contract is included in the 2021 Adopted Budget for the FasTracks capital program in the specific
projects where PSC support would be utilized.

As you know, our collective decision-making is accomplished in large part
through our standing committees, five committees of the whole that hear and
consider actions in their respective subject matter areas. Recently, Chair
Rivera-Malpiede asked the two of us, Shelley Cook and Doug Tisdale, to serve
on an ad hoc basis to gather information about alternatives and best practices
and to analyze whether it would be advisable to alter that structure.
It might first be useful to highlight what committees do or should do, and to
consider ways that smaller committees might, or might not, facilitate that:
•

•

•

Provide an avenue for hearing, discussing and distilling varied points of
view into recommendations for board action. Smaller committees may
have a greater facility to delve more fully into the pros and cons of an
action or policy before landing on a recommended course.
Serve as a mechanism for exploring new ideas and, when appropriate,
taking up and fleshing those out, whether brought from the board, staff
or stakeholders. The Eadie-Stackrow framework (discussed in the White
Paper) provides for a change initiative portfolio – a built-in means of
identifying, prioritizing and moving forward with policies or projects.
Create space for alternatives to be considered and compromises reached.
Smaller committees allow their members greater speaking time, making
give and take more likely. With the Eadie-Stackrow framework,
committee charters can spell out their manner of operation to foster
more cooperative and productive work.

The attached White Paper is a thought piece, meant to provide information
concerning different frameworks so that we might facilitate an informed
discussion about utilizing a different type and scope of involvement than has
been the case in the past. In going through it, however, we would suggest you
regard it as fodder, food for thought, rather than a prescription. To help
explore a way forward, here are three potential paths that encompass to
varying degrees the concepts presented more fully in the White Paper. These
are for illustration and discussion only at this time and do not represent a
recommended action.

questions you might consider while reviewing all of these materials:

15.A.b

A White Paper Prepared by the RTD Ad Hoc Committee on Committee Structure

Over the course of the past year a number of Directors have expressed growing concern with
the present Board Committee structure at RTD. The RTD Board Bylaws currently provide for
seven standing committees: Civil Rights; Communications and Government Relations; Finance,
Administration & Audit; Operations and Customer Service; Planning/Capital Programs &
FasTracks; General Manager Oversight and Performance Management; and Executive. The
Executive Committee is composed of the five elected Board Officers. The Board’s custom and
policy – i.e., this is not addressed in the Bylaws – is that the GMOC is composed of the Board
Chair and six other Directors. The five other standing committees are committees of the
whole, meaning that all 15 Directors serve on each of those five committees.
The expressed concern resulted in the formation of this ad hoc committee. The Charter for
this committee states:
The Ad Hoc Committee on Committee Structure (ad hoc committee) has been formed by the
Chair of the Board to analyze whether it would be advisable to alter the composition of the
standing committees to:
o optimize the number of members assigned to each committee;
o encourage full and fruitful debate by decentralizing decision-making;
o promote meeting efficiencies; and
o enhance specialization of subject-matter knowledge by Board members.
The ad hoc committee identified specific objectives to be addressed in its work:
 Enhance understanding of good governance as a shared focus and responsibility of the
board, CEO, and SLT. See Building a High Impact Board-CEO Partnership, APTA Transit
Board Members Webinar Series, July 6, 2020 (APTA Webinar), found at
https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/recording/5266399421359520526;
 Transform the Board into a more high-powered “governing engine.” Id.
 “…ensure accountability, an adequate division of labor, and subject-matter expertise.”

A Work in Progress

15.A.b

Eadie-Stackrow Framework
The ad hoc committee determined early on that any change in committee structure should be
considered carefully, particularly since the committee of the whole structure was established
over 13 years ago and remained unchanged even after the 2010 State Audit. See Appendix: An
Historical Note By Director Tisdale, infra. The committee believes that a pilot project is
preferable, but has so far left that open as to scope and type. Identifying a pilot project,
however, assumes an understanding of the outlines of a fuller implementation. To that end,
below is what a restructuring of our standing committees might look like using the framework
laid out in Doug Eadie and David Stackrow’s book, Building a Solid Board-CEO Partnership: A
Practical Guidebook for Transit Board Members, CEOs, and CEO-Aspirants (2019) (Guidebook).
Key Principles of the Framework:
 Board and CEO “work as a team in getting the key
governing decisions made”
 Board members “play an active role in shaping – not
just making – the really critical governing decisions.”
 CEO is ‘Chief Governing Partner’ –assumed to be
actively involved in managing the relationship with
the board, working with it to design effective
governing processes, helping it build capacity, and
enabling SLT engagement to support the board as a
high impact body
 The Board will be governing at the highest level when
it collaborates with the CEO and the SLT in answering
the three critical questions in the box below:

Comment/Source/Elaboration
Comments found in the Foreword, text and
especially the intro pages of Chapter 2 (highly
recommended 3-min read – see Appendix p. 5);
or APTA Webinar presentation and ppt, slide 11.
Focus is on breaking down the “we-they” model
by making CEO more of a governing partner with
the Board.

Beware of Silo Committees, the Guidebook
warns. These are committees that reflect your
organization’s administrative and operational
structure. Some Guidebook observations that
seem germane to RTD:
 Such committees lack ‘horizontal
discipline’ – “chopping the governing
work into narrow slices of organizational
life that draw committee members’
attention to parts of the transit
authority, rather than the whole”
 Can turn board committees into
“technical or operational advisory

Board committees should flow from those functions, he says,
suggesting they be focused on planning, performance
monitoring, and external relations. Board committees need to
be integrative.

Correspondence with current Committees:

1. Planning = Strategic and Operational Planning
Committee.
Accountable for designing and coordinating the
board’s participation in strategic and operational
planning, including annual budget preparation

 Operations and Customer
Service; Planning & Capital
Programs & FasTracks; Finance,
Administration & Audit

2. Performance Monitoring/Audit Committee
Accountable for overseeing programmatic and
financial performance, for updating operational
policies and systems, and for overseeing the audit
function
3. External/Stakeholder Relations Committee
Responsible for maintaining effective communication
and working relationships with the community in
general and key stakeholders such as local
governments, for developing the annual legislative
relations program and strategy, and for making sure
that volunteer involvement in the authority’s affairs is
highly productive and satisfying.
Case study of what this might look like using
External/Stakeholder Relations as an example, below:

 Finance, Administration & Audit;
Operations and Customer Service; Civil
Rights

 Communications and Governmental
Relations

This current committee most closely aligns with
the recommended committee purposes.

From Guidebook section on Board Governing
Engines in Action, Chapter 5. (See Appendix, page
7)

The board’s external/stakeholder relations committee has
worked closely with the vice president for public affairs over
the past year on three top priorities: Strengthening the
authority’s working relationships with a number of highpriority stakeholder organizations, such as the county
commission and mayor’s office; engaging board members

committees rather than broad governing
engines”
They are more conducive to
micromanagement, and that predictably
sparks a defensive reaction by staff
members

systematically in building the authority’s image in the
community; and upgrading the authority’s legislative relations
function. The committees focus on stakeholder relations has
already generated some powerful results in terms of closer,
more productive partnerships with key stakeholders. The
committee began its work by holding a special work session at
which a long list of stakeholders was winnowed down to a
group of fifteen that involved the highest stakes, most notably
customers, money, political support and collaboration. The
committee then worked with staff to come up with a specific
relationship-building and maintenance strategy tailored to
each stakeholder, including the responsibilities of board and
executive team members.
Standing Committee parameters – Eadie recommendations for
discussion:
 Require that every board member serve on one and
only one standing committee.
 Require that the only path to the full board agenda be
through the standing committees
 Have all reports and recommendations made by
standing committee chairs and members.
 Regularly rotate committee chairs and members
TBD: number per committee, number constituting a quorum

Change Investment Portfolio: Suggested to be stood up
alongside the regular processes.

->Note – if each board member serves on one of
three standing committees, it would average out
to five members per standing committee (a
suggestion that Paul Ballard has made). Perhaps
some committees have more members than
others. Consider whether Executive Committee
members should serve on more than one. The
more specialized committees (GMOC, ad hoc
committees) are excluded from consideration in
this paper.
See book excerpt, Appendix, p. 11

In a nutshell, the Portfolio Process, which is run parallel to, and
separate from, your authority’s business-as-usual operation
planning/budget development process, produces out-of-thebox change in the form of concrete projects that we can call
‘change initiatives.’ These change initiatives are housed in
what you might call your authority’s ‘Change Investment
Portfolio,’ where they are pilot tested and eventually
mainstreamed into the annual budget and ongoing operations
– or occasionally abandoned if they’ve proved unworkable.

Performance Monitoring Committee, p.85-86
The crowning of achievement of the board’s performance monitoring committee during its first year of operation was a
complete overhaul of the monthly financial report to the board, which was unveiled as the first meeting of the new fiscal
year. The report had traditionally consisted of twenty-some pages so chock-full of rows and columns of numbers that it
defied easy understanding – indeed, it was a bit overwhelming. Even the most financially savvy board members
occasionally found themselves confused while thumbing through this nearly impenetrable tome. Working closely with the
CEO and her chief financial officer over the course of three intensive work sessions, the performance monitoring
committee had come up with a far more comprehendible report…The content of the financial report was reordered –
organizaing specific objects of expenditure by major functions within the authority’s eight cost centers. An executive
summary consisting of bar charts showing actual versus budgeted expenditures for the quarter by major cost center sna
identifying significant developments and emerging trends was put on PowerPoint slides for presentation…
Planning and Development Committee, p. 86-87
The board’s planning and development committee worked closely with the CEO, deputy CEO, the vice president for
planning, and an outside consultant/facilitator in designing and hosting their authority’s first annual daylong “strategic
planning work session.” The agenda for this power-packed day included brainstorming the elements of an updated
values and vision statement, reviewing a conditions and trends analysis prepared by staff…identifying a number of
strategic issues facing the authority and brainstorming possible innovation initiatives to address particular issues.
The planning and development committee oversaw follow-through to the strategic work session, working closely with the
CEO and deputy CEO. This included fine-tuning a draft of the updated values and visions statement…The committee was
also intensively involved in coming up with a short list of strategic issues (both challenges and opportunities) emerging
from the strategic work session that were to be addressed by task forces charged to come up with concrete action
initiatives. For example, one issue was an alarming increase in violent incidents on a handful of bus routes. Others
included addressing evolving transportation needs in the community by negotiating and pilot testing arrangements with
providers such as Uber and Lyft and strengthening the authority’s working relationship with the business community –
most importantly the chambers of commerce in the region. The planning and development committee reviewed the
action initiatives generated by the staff task forces that had been formed, revised and finalized the initiatives, and took
the lead in presenting them in a special board meeting, after which pilot tests were launched. One of the committee’s
major responsibilities will be to determine, based on the pilot tests, which initiatives will be mainstreamed in the annual
operating plan and budget.
External/Stakeholder Relations Committee, p. 88-89
The board’s external/stakeholder relations committee has worked closely with the vice president for public affairs over
the past year on three top priorities: Strengthening the authority’s working relationships with a number of high-priority
stakeholder organizations, such as the county commission and mayor’s office; engaging board members systematically in
building the authority’s image in the community; and upgrading the authority’s legislative relations function. The
committees focus on stakeholder relations has already generated some powerful results in terms of closer, more
productive partnerships with key stakeholders. The committee began its work by holding a special work session at which
a long list of stakeholders was winnowed down to a group of fifteen that involved the highest stakes, most notably
customers, money, political support and collaboration. The committee then worked with staff to come up with a specific
relationship-building and maintenance strategy tailored to each stakeholder, including the responsibilities of board and
executive team members.

Interesting highlight, bearing in mind the distinctive population served:


Unitrans Davis: As I wrote previously, Unitrans serves the California college town where UC Davis is located.
Ninety percent of the bus system’s riders travel to or from campus, and all undergraduates receive unlimited
trips through a flat tuition fee. Unitrans doesn’t have a traditional board, but rather is governed by ASUCD, a
student government organization that, while tasked with much more than just transit issues, is elected by the
undergraduate students who pay the tuition fee. Overall, the transit agency provides reliable service, enjoys a
positive relationship with the community, and has avoided the ridership challenges that other providers across
the country, including Yolobus (which also serves Davis), are struggling with.

RTD Ad Hoc Committee on Committee Structure

An Historical Note

Attached hereto is a summary sheet and associated charts prepared by the Board
Office Staff summarizing RTD Board Bylaws amendments from 2004 through 2010. The
following is intended to be a narrative summary of the information contained in those
documents. (For context, there have been no changes in the RTD Board Bylaws regarding
the membership on standing committees since 2007.)
Prior to 2007, the RTD Board of Directors appears to have had five Standing
Committees plus an Executive Committee, each of which had a limited number of
members on such committee. The total of six committees were Administrative/Finance;
Operations/Customer Service/Marketing; Planning and Development; Contracted Services
(added in 2005); and the Executive Committee. These were as established in the RTD
Board Bylaws.
In 2007 there was a sea change in committee structure. The critical change in the
Bylaws was to establish five standing committees as “Committees of the Whole,” meaning
that each Director was by definition, and without need of appointment by the Chair, a
member of such standing committee.
The five standing committees of the whole established by the Bylaws in 2007 were
articulated as: Financial Administration; FasTracks; Legislative; Operations/Customer
Service/Marketing; and Planning. The Executive Committee was not changed in these
2007 Bylaw amendments. At some point after 2007, Civil Rights was added as a standing
committee, and FasTracks was merged into the Planning Committee. Some of these
changes were apparently motivated by the 2010 State Audit.
At the same time, there were certain other committees of the Board, which were not
committees of the whole. These are shown in the attached summary sheet.
As nearly as we can reconstruct, the reason for shifting from committees with limited
membership to committees of the whole was driven by a sense that Directors who were not
members of various committees were “left out” and “not a part of” important decisions being
made by these committees. It is a situation that is sometimes referred to as “government
by the elites.”
The 2010 State Audit at p. 58 noted that committees of the whole “can be useful as a
means of accomplishing certain aspects of the Board’s business…, [affording] every member
the opportunity to be involved in standing committee’s business, thereby providing for more
open participation by Board members, greater information sharing and expeditied
decisionmaking. However, given the potential disadvantages [undermining the efficiencies
gained by having a division of labor and not developing subject-matter expertise], the Board
should reevaluate its use of the committee of the whole as the primary means of organizing
[committees].” The Board did make some changes to committee structure in response to
21

By Director Tisdale

15.A.b

the report (added GMOC, added Civil Rights, added Audit), but did not adjust the general
approach of committees of the whole.

The question presented to the Ad Hoc Committee is whether it would be advisable to
alter the composition of the standing committees that was established and incorporated
into the RTD Board Bylaws in 2007. A more complete statement of this committee’s charge
is found in the Committee Charter. The reason for the issuance of this charge, as stated in
the Charter, is sentiment that committees of the whole may lead to inefficiencies and
overly long meetings.

--Doug Tisdale

Packet Pg. 90

Attachment: White Paper and Attachments (4441 : Ad Hoc Committee on Committee Structure Update)

So, for 13 years the RTD Bylaws have provided for committees of the whole for five
standing committees.

• Erroneous assumptions about the nature of governing that sound
plausible and are often recommended by self-styled “governing
gurus” – but can damage the board-CEO partnership
• Some common Insidious Foes:
 Stellar organizational and/or CEO performance will keep the board-chief
executive relationship healthy.
 There’s a firewall between the board’s “policy making” role and the
transit authority’s executive management function that must be
preserved: the twain can’t be allowed to meet.
 Fashioning governing policies (rules of the governing game) will ensure
effective governing decisions and judgments (known as the “policy
governance” approach).
 Board members aren’t interested in building their board’s selfmanagement capacity (including managing their governing
performance).

4 Emerging Facts of Life in Transit Governance
1. Changing board member expectations: to be actively engaged in shaping, as
well as making, high-impact decisions that make a real difference (and not
merely an audience for finished staff work!)
2. View of the board’s governing work as much more complex than the
traditional notion of “policy making” – involving board engagement in
carefully designed decision-making processes
3. View of governing as a “team sport” involving the board, CEO and executive
managers working as a Strategic Governing Team
4. Growing recognition that a transit board is a particular type of organization
that can be systematically developed – in terms of the people on the board;
the board’s governing role and functions; the board’s self management
capacity; and the board’s governing structure.

Question #2

Packet Pg. 122

Building and Maintaining a Solid Board-CEO
Partnership a Formidable Challenge
• Lingering adversarial we-they tradition: many board members still
focusing on “watching the critters so they don’t steal the store”
• Limited opportunity to shape board composition
• Tremendous centrifugal force: the pull of board members’
appointing authorities and constituencies working against loyalty to
the authority and board colleagues and against board teamwork
• Always fragile board-CEO partnership because of:
 The high-achieving, strong-willed, and demanding cast of characters at
the top of your authority, making for a volatile mix
 And the complex, high-stakes, and frequently negative issues board
members and the CEO continuously deal with, tending to wear out the
relationship

4 Keys To Building and Maintaining A Healthy
Board-CEO Working Relationship
1.

A really board-savvy CEO

2.

A board standing committee (typically Governance or Board
Operations) responsible for the board-CEO working
relationship

3.

Clear, detailed board-CEO (and board-executive staff)
communication and interaction guidelines

4.

A well-designed, outcomes-focused process for board
evaluation of CEO performance (Not a subjective
questionnaire!)

Really Board-Savvy CEOs
• Bring the right attitude to the governing game: See their board as one of
their authority’s most precious assets – not a threat – and make the governing
function a top-tier CEO priority.
• Are world-class governing experts: Understand the rapidly evolving field of
public/nonprofit governance inside-out.
• Wear the Chief Board Capacity Builder Hat: Play the leading role in helping
their board clarify its governing role and functions and update its governing
structure and processes.

• Handled by the governance (board operations) committee
• Is done at least annually – with the CEO present
• Is outcomes-focused, not functional
• Focuses on 2 performance tiers: (1) overall authority
operational performance; (2) chief executive CEO-centric
leadership targets
• Note: Avoid having individual board members complete
pseudo-scientific functional evaluation questionnaires that
tend to be highly subjective, produce questionable results and
are open to abuse.

Well-Designed Standing Committees
• Correspond to the major streams of decisions and judgments that
make up your board’s governing work (form following function)
• Cut across all of your authority’s operations and functions (not tied to
narrow operational and administrative silos such as bus operations,
paratransit, maintenance, personnel, finance, etc., which invite micromanagement)
• Are standing, not ad hoc, committees

Governance (Board Operations) Committee

• Headed by board chair
• Consists of other standing committee chairs and the
CEO
• Serves as committee on board operations:
coordinating committee work, developing the
board agenda, managing the board-CEO
partnership, overseeing board performance

• Every board member serves on 1 and only 1
committee (except committee chairs)
• Committees are the only path to the full board
agenda and only committees report in full board
meetings (except the CEO’s report)
• Committee chairs and members are regularly
rotated among committees
• An executive manager is assigned as Chief Staff
Liaison to each committee

Two Key Roles Of Well-Designed Governing
Committees:
• Preparing for board meetings: action recommendations and
informational reports
• Working with the CEO and executive team members in
thinking through how board members should be
meaningfully engaged in key processes, such as strategic and
operational planning, budget development, and performance
monitoring – helping to shape governing “products,” rather
than just thumbing through them

Twin Aims Of Governing Process Design

• To generate technically sound governing decisions and
judgments.
• To engage board members in a meaningful, proactive fashion
so that they are transformed into satisfied owners of their
governing decisions and judgments (owners typically being
more committed to decisions than audience members for
finished staff work)
