BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
2024 Legislative and Government Relations Program

October 19, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
October 24, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt the 2024 Legislative and Government Relations Program.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Davies, Government Relations Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
As part of the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan, staff initiated a process to develop and implement an annual
Legislative Program. The Board of Directors approved the agency’s first Legislative Program in October
2021. The Legislative Program is adopted by the Board annually and serves as a guiding document for
Government Relations staff, and external advocates, to pursue goals related to legislation and policy
matters. Additionally, the Legislative Program serves as an organizing document that can be adjusted
throughout a legislative session to provide an avenue for Board adopted policy positions to be
communicated and pursued by agency staff.

DISCUSSION
In line with the agency’s mission and vision established in the Strategic Plan, the development and
inclusion of the goals and actions contained in the Legislative and Government Relations Program are
designed to make lives better through connections. It is important that RTD serve as a trusted partner to
the region’s local, state, and federal elected officials. To achieve the adopted goals, RTD must be
proactive in education and inform the District’s elected officials of the challenges and opportunities
available to advance shared goals. Equally important is building trust through partnership that fits within
the framework of RTD’s financial forecast. The proposed 2024 Legislative and Government Relations
Program, included as Attachment A to this Board report, outlines priority actions on a variety of issues
that staff believe are achievable through advocacy and collaboration.
If approved, the 2024 Legislative Program will be implemented and effective beginning Monday, January
1, 2024.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
While RTD may be financially impacted by certain legislation, Board approval of this document has no
immediate agency financial impact.

2024 Legislative and Government Relations Program
PURPOSE
To establish a set of Board-approved legislative and advocacy policies that benefit the Regional
Transportation District (RTD) and assist in guiding staff’s actions and efforts during the 2024 legislative
session that support the priorities and success outcomes of the agency’s adopted 2021-2026 Strategic
Plan.
STRATEGY
Developing and maintaining relationships with myriad stakeholders is central to RTD’s strategic
approach to government relations. Staff will work to communicate, educate, inform and partner with
the agency’s Congressional delegation, the Governor’s Office, the state General Assembly delegation,
and local elected officials to advocate for Board approved policies.
Additionally, staff will continue to work with its industry associations – such as the America Public
Transportation Association (APTA), the Colorado Association of Transit Agencies (CASTA), regional
transportation management organizations/associations (TMOs/TMAs), Chambers of Commerce, and
other stakeholder organizations – to partner and collaborate on shared goals to advance and seek
support for legislative positions approved by the Board. Lastly, tactics included in the Legislative
Program will be guided and informed by the priorities set forth in the agency’s Board-approved 20212026 Strategic Plan – Community Value, Customer Excellence, Employee Ownership, Financial Success.
EXECUTION PLAN
Contained herein are specific priorities and actions that outline areas of focus for the 2024 Legislative
and Government Relations Program. Beyond the actions listed in this program, specific legislative
matters are likely to arise that warrant consideration by the Board of Directors.
To allow staff flexibility for consideration of items to be changed, added, or deleted as a result of
legislation introduced during the legislative session, the recommended change must be presented to the
Board as part of the Board Executive Committee or another Committee deemed appropriate by the
General Manager/CEO and Board Chair. If time does not allow for an item to be agendized for a
Committee meeting for discussion by the Board, RTD will remain neutral on the legislation in question.

enhance penalties for
assault related crimes on
RTD front-line employees

E. Support legislation to

Zero-Fare for Youth
program

Providing a welcoming and optimal working environment for RTD’s
front-line employees is paramount to retaining and attracting a
workforce needed to deliver transit services to its service area.
Following examples in other states, RTD staff will work to identify
a bill sponsor to introduce and pass state legislation that would
reclassify RTD transit workers to enhance penalties for committing
assault on an RTD employee while performing job duties.
Starting September 1, 2023 through August 31, 2024, RTD has
implemented a pilot program to offer zero-fare transit services for
youth customers ages 19 and under. While RTD is providing
funding for the initial pilot program, should the program be
extended beyond the pilot year, RTD is seeking external funding
sources to support on-going operations of a zero-fare for youth
program.

provide information and best practices for implementing funding
eligible for transit operations or capital improvements that assist
RTD in providing optimal transit services.

B. Subregional Service

Program

In accordance with recommendations made by the Accountability
Committee, RTD staff will continue to administer the Boardapproved framework for Subregional Service Councils. The
Subregional Service Councils will serve as a forum to discuss and
receive feedback on service planning. Additionally, the Subregional
Service Councils administer the process for RTD’s Call for Projects
Partnership Program.

and boards of county commissioners within RTD’s geographic
boundaries.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Monthly Government Relations Report – October 2023

October 19, 2023

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Davies, Government Relations Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
Pursuant to the Board-adopted 2023 Legislative Program, the agency developed a Legislative Program
that serves as a guiding document for staff to pursue goals related to legislative and policy matters. A
Legislative Program serves as a living document that can be adjusted throughout a legislative session to
provide an avenue for Board adopted policy positions to be communicated and pursued by agency staff.
In line with the agency’s mission and vision established in the Strategic Plan, the development and
inclusion of the goals and actions contained in the Legislative Program are designed to make lives better
through connections.
It is important that RTD serve as a trusted partner to the region’s local, state, and federal elected
officials. To achieve these goals, RTD must be proactive in educating and informing the District’s elected
officials of the challenges and opportunities available to advance shared goals.
In furtherance of the program, the agency’s Government Relations Officer coordinates and develops
strategic communications to advance the agency’s legislative priorities and serve as a point of contact
for elected officials in the Denver metro region.
DISCUSSION
Included herein are notable government relations highlights at the federal, state and local levels since the
last Executive Committee meeting held on Thursday, September 21, 2023. This report was prepared on
October 12, 2023, and will be updated verbally as needed during the Executive Committee meeting
scheduled for Thursday, October 19, 2023.
Federal
On the federal level, Congress was able to avert a government shutdown by passing a Continuing
Resolution (CR) to provide funding for federal government programs through November 17, 2023.
Following the vote to approve the current CR, majority members in the House of Representatives moved
to hold a vote to remove the Speaker of the House. The motion to vacate was approved by House
members, and the Speaker was removed from his position. As of the preparation of this report, an

Packet Pg. 12

1.5.1

interim Speaker is currently serving in the position while the House prepares to hold votes on a new
Speaker on October 12, 2023. Whether a Speaker is seated in the near term will likely impact Congress’
ability to approve a full FFY2024 appropriations package, or alternatively to pass another CR to keep
federal government programs running on a temporary basis. Agency staff will continue to track these
developments closely and communicate any impacts to the agency’s Congressional delegation.
State
At the state level, the General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) and Board Chair presented before the
Transportation Legislation Review Committee (TLRC) on Tuesday, October 3, 2023. Topics covered in
the presentation included the funding awarded pursuant to Call for Projects Partnership Program and
preliminary data related to 2023 Zero Fare for Better Air period garnered during the month of July 2023.
Full details and takeaways regarding the 2023 Zero Fare for Better Air initiative will be communicated to
the TLRC when all data – including information from September 2023 – can be compiled and analyzed.
Additionally, as was previously reported to the Board in September 2023, the TLRC was considering
approval of two interim bills that would impact public transportation. The bills included continued
funding for the Ozone Season Transit Grant Program and funding for Zero Fare for Youth programs
statewide. A separate bill directing the Colorado Department of Transportation to convene a group to
study implementation of a statewide transit pass was also approved. The TLRC combined these separate
bills into one consolidated measure during the committee’s meeting on Tuesday, October 3, 2023.
Lastly, the GM/CEO and Chief People Officer engaged with a small group of TLRC members on
Thursday, October 5, 2023, to present information on agency efforts to recruit and retain employees in
alignment with the 2023-2024 People Power Strategic Initiative.
Local
Related to local government activities, the GM/CEO participated in a discussion with the Northwest
Mayors and Commissioners Coalition on Tuesday, September 26, 2023. Topics of discussion included
an update on the Northwest Rail Peak Service Feasibility Study and coordination with Front Range
Passenger Rail; People Power; Subregional Services Councils; and funding awards related to the Call for
Projects Partnership Program.

Committee Meeting Date:
2024 Meeting Calendar

October 19, 2023

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Jack Kroll, Executive Manager, Board Office
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
Each year, the Executive Committee reviews and provides consensus on the Board’s meeting calendar
for the following year.
DISCUSSION
Except as described herein, pursuant to the meeting schedule outlined in the amended Board Bylaws
adopted December 7, 2021, standing committee meetings will be held the second Tuesday and
Wednesday of each month, regular Board Meetings will be held on the fourth Tuesday of each month,
and no standing committee or Board meetings will be scheduled for August or December of a given year.
Exceptions to the standard meeting cadence are as follows:
In January, the first meeting of the year, a Special Board Meeting, will be held on Tuesday,
January 9, shifting the regular meeting cycle to begin the third week of the month.
In April, due to the APTA Legislative Conference and in consideration of Passover, the meeting
cycle was pushed back a week to begin the third week of the month.
In July, the Conference of Minority Transportation Officials 52nd Annual Meeting and Training of
Conference, of which RTD is a member, conflicted with the standard meeting cadence, so
meetings were pushed back to begin the third week of the month.
While other potential scheduling conflicts exist between the Board’s meeting calendar and the proposed
scheduling of large-scale transit industry conferences, such as the APTA Mobility Conference, the timing
of such events is anticipated to allow for full Director and agency leadership participation in most
instances.
The meeting demonstrates the agency’s commitment to meet the RTD Strategic Priorities of Community
Value and Employee Ownership.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Third Amendment to Salaried Employees' Defined
Contribution Plan

October 3, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
October 24, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve a third amendment to the Salaried Employees’ Defined
Contribution Plan to change the vesting schedule to 20% vesting at one year of employment, and an
additional 20% at each year of employment thereafter, with 100% vesting at five years.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
Non-represented employees hired before January 1, 2008, participate in a defined benefit pension plan.
This pension plan was closed to new non-represented employees hired on or after January 1, 2008, who
instead participate in a defined contribution plan. The defined contribution plan qualifies as an Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) section 401(a) plan.
This defined contribution plan is funded by contributions from RTD of 9% of qualifying wages. The
current plan documents provide for a five-year cliff vesting, during which period employees do not vest
or own any portion of these contributions until they reach five years of continuous employment with
RTD. Therefore, if a non-represented employee terminates employment prior to reaching five years of
employment, all employer contributions are forfeited to the plan and used for administrative expenses.
IRS rules do not permit returning forfeited employer contributions to the employer.
The represented employee defined benefit pension plan was closed to new employees hired January 1,
2023, and thereafter and a defined contribution 401(a) plan is provided. This represented employee
defined contribution plan provides a vesting schedule of 20% for each full year of continuous
employment with RTD. Therefore, represented employees vest at 20% at one year of employment, 40%
at two years of employment, and so on until they reach 100% vesting at five years of employment.
DISCUSSION
The non-represented employee defined contribution plan trustees, including Directors Broom and Dishell,
recommend that the vesting schedule be changed from a five-year cliff vesting to a schedule wherein
employees vest at 20% at one year of full employment, and at an additional 20% each year of
employment thereafter, with 100% vesting at five years. This proposed schedule aligns with the
represented employee defined contribution plan vesting schedule and has been determined to be more

Packet Pg. 18

2.16.A

favorably viewed by employees than a five-year cliff vesting schedule. It may also contribute to RTD’s
ability to attract and retain talent by enhancing the total rewards benefit package. It thus aligns with the
Strategic Plan Success Outcomes of Employee Ownership and Financial Success.
Should this recommendation be approved by the Board, the non-represented employee defined
contribution plan will be amended, and the Plan recordkeeper will enact the vesting changes effective
February 1, 2024. The new vesting schedule would apply to non-represented employees from that date,
and those hired on or after that date. For example, a current, active non-represented employee who has
reached three years of continuous employment will be vested at 60% at the time that the plan changes
are effective on February 1, 2024.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with this recommended action. Changes to the vesting schedule
may result in lower forfeitures within the non-represented defined contribution plan; however, it is
estimated that these forfeitures will continue to be adequate to fund plan administrative expenses.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

2024 Investment Policy

October 3, 2023
Board Meeting Date:

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the 2024 Investment Policy.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
Brenden Morgan, Senior Manager of Debt and Investments
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
Each year staff presents for the Board’s consideration the proposed Investment Policy for the upcoming
fiscal year in accordance with Fiscal Policy requirements. The Investment Policy may be amended by the
Board at any time.
The most recent modification to the Investment Policy was approved by the Board in October 2022 for
the 2023 fiscal year.
DISCUSSION
The purpose of the Investment Policy is to specify the policies and procedures that support a prudent
and systematic program for investment of RTD’s operating funds, debt proceeds, and reserve funds.
The primary objectives of RTD’s Investment Policy in order of priority are: 1) safety of principal, 2)
sufficient liquidity to meet known cash flow requirements, and 3) yield to achieve a market rate of
return. Although RTD must follow the investment parameters dictated by state law (§24-75-601.1,
C.R.S.), this Investment Policy is more conservative in order to achieve the Strategic Priority of Financial
Success.
Staff is recommending minor grammatical changes to the 2024 Investment Policy as shown in the
attached. No other changes are requested at this time.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with this action item.

2024 INVESTMENT POLICY

1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this document is to specify the policies and procedures that support a prudent
and systematic program for investment transactions involving operating and reserve funds of the
Regional Transportation District ("RTD").
2. SCOPE
This investment policy ("Policy") applies to investment of all operating and reserve funds of RTD
(collectively, the “Portfolio").
This Policy shall not restrict the ability of RTD to invest proceeds from the issuance of RTD
securities in financial obligations permitted through Board-approved bond resolutions or indentures
of trust pursuant to which the securities were issued. The standards of care dictated for
investments of other RTD funds shall also pertain to the investment of such proceeds.
3. OBJECTIVES
The objectives, in priority order, of the RTD's investment activities shall be:
3.1 Safety
Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the investment program. Investments of RTD will
be made in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the Portfolio. To attain
this objective, RTD will endeavor to mitigate credit and interest rate risks.
Credit Risk: RTD will minimize credit risk, which is the risk of loss due to the failure of the
security issuer or backer, by:
•
•

Limiting investments to the types of securities listed in the Authorized Investments
section of this Policy.
Diversifying the Portfolio in accordance with Policy limits in order to minimize the
potential for losses from any one type of security or any one individual issuer.

Subject: 2024 Investment Policy
Page 2

Interest Rate Risk: RTD will minimize interest rate risk, which is the risk that the market value
of securities in the Portfolio will fall due to changes in market interest rates, by:
Maintaining Portfolio duration appropriate to the cash flow requirements of RTD, thereby
reducing the likelihood that securities would need to be sold on the open market prior
to maturity

3.2 Liquidity
The Portfolio will remain sufficiently liquid to enable RTD to meet all cash flow requirements
which might be reasonably anticipated. This will be achieved through maturity diversification and
purchases of securities that have an established secondary market.
3.3 Yield
The Portfolio shall be designed with the objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout
budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account the investment risk constraints, liquidity
needs, and cash flow characteristics of the Portfolio.

4. STANDARDS OF CARE
4.1 Prudence
All RTD officers and employees involved in the investment of RTD funds, along with any external
investment advisors, shall adhere to the guidance provided by the “prudent investor” standard to
insure that:
“When investing, reinvesting, purchasing, acquiring, exchanging, selling, or managing
public funds, a trustee shall act with care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the
circumstances then prevailing, including, but not limited to, the general economic
conditions and the anticipated needs of the agency, that a prudent person acting in a like
capacity and familiar with those matters would use in the conduct of funds of a like
character and with like aims, to safeguard the principal and maintain the liquidity needs of
the agency. Within the limitations of this section and considering individual investments
as part of an overall strategy, investments may be acquired as authorized by law."
RTD shall recognize that no investment is totally riskless and that the investment activities of
RTD are a matter of public record. Accordingly, it recognizes that occasional measured losses are
inevitable in a diversified portfolio and shall be considered within the context of the overall
Portfolio’s return, provided that adequate diversification has been implemented, and that the sale
of a security is in the best long-term interest of RTD.

Authorized investment personnel acting in accordance with this Policy and exercising due
diligence shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security’s credit risk or market
price changes, provided that deviations from expectation are reported in a timely fashion and
appropriate action is taken to control adverse developments.

RTD is granted legislative authority to invest its funds pursuant to Colorado Revised Statutes,
Section 32-9-119. Management responsibility for the investment program is hereby delegated to
the General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) and her designees. The GM/CEO’s designee will
hereinafter be referred to as the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”).
RTD may, in its discretion, contract with one or more investment advisers, registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, to manage a
portion of its Portfolio assets. Any such advisor shall comply with this Policy and such other
written instructions as provided by RTD.
While it is understood that the procedures and trading counterparties of a contracted investment
adviser may differ from those of RTD, contracted investment advisers must maintain internal
controls and compliance systems at least as extensive as those of the RTD in order to assure
adequate protection of RTD assets in keeping with the standards of prudence outlined below.
4.3 Investment Procedures
The CFO shall establish written procedures for the operation of the investment program,
consistent with this Policy, which shall include explicit delegation of authority to persons
responsible for investment transactions. No person may engage in an investment transaction
except as provided under the terms of this Policy and the internal procedures established by the
CFO. Persons who are authorized to transact investment business and wire funds on behalf of
RTD are listed in Appendix 1 to this policy.
4.4 Internal Controls
The CFO shall establish a system of internal controls, which shall be reviewed annually. The
controls shall be designed to prevent loss of funds due to fraud, employee error, misrepresentation
by third parties, or imprudent actions by employees of RTD.
4.5 Ethics and Conflicts of Interest
Investment activities shall be performed in accordance with RTD’s Code of Ethics and other
policies of RTD. Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from
personal business activity that could conflict with the proper execution of the investment

5. AUTHORIZED INVESTMENTS
Authorized investments for RTD funds are specifically listed below. RTD recognizes that
investment risk can result from issuer defaults, market price changes or various technical
impediments leading to diminished liquidity or loss of capital. Portfolio risk management and
diversification are employed as a way to minimize the risks inherent in investing.
Credit Criteria: Credit criteria listed in this section refer to the credit rating at the time the security
is purchased. Rating categories defined by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations
(“NRSROs”) include intermediate rating categories. For example, the second highest rating
category (“AA”) includes bonds rated AA+, AA and AA- for Standard & Poor's and Fitch, and
Aa1, Aa2 and Aa3 for Moody's Investors Service. In the event that an issuer or security is
downgraded below the minimum rating level for any specific security that is held in the Portfolio,
the CFO will review the exposure of that security holding and will determine if it is advisable to
sell such holding.
Maturity Restrictions: Maturity restrictions shall be calculated from settlement date to maturity
date. Portfolio percentage restrictions by security type and issuer are applicable only on the date
of purchase of the investment.
Sector Diversification: The Portfolio will be limited to an aggregate exposure of 50% for the
following investment types: Municipal Bonds, Corporate Bonds, Commercial Paper, Time
Deposits/Time Certificates of Deposit and Banker's Acceptances.
1. U.S. Treasury Obligations. Obligations in the form of bills, notes, bonds or certificates of
indebtedness backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America. 100%
of the Portfolio may be invested in U.S. Treasury Obligations. The maximum maturity for
investments in U.S. Treasury Obligations shall be limited to five years.
2. Federal Agency and Instrumentality Securities: Obligations, participations or other
instruments of any Federal agency, instrumentality or United States government-sponsored
enterprise as described in CRS 24-75-601.1(1)(b) (an “Agency” or “Agencies”). Such
securities shall be rated in one of the two highest rating categories (as described above in
the Credit Criteria section) by at least two NRSROs. No more than 75% of the Portfolio
may be invested in Federal Agency and Instrumentality Securities, with no more than 25%

program, or which could impair their ability to make impartial investment decisions. Employees
and investment officials shall disclose to the GM/CEO any material financial interests in financial
institutions that conduct business with RTD, and they shall further disclose any large
personal/financial/investment positions that could be related to the performance of the Portfolio.
Employees and officers shall subordinate their personal investment transactions to those of RTD
particularly with regard to the timing of purchases or sales.

more than 50% of the Portfolio.
6. INVESTMENT PARAMETERS
6.1 Sale of Securities
RTD does not make investments for the purpose of trading or speculation, but, rather, with the
prevalent intent to hold securities to maturity. The prohibition of speculative investment precludes
pursuit of profit through unusual risk or conjectural fluctuations in market prices. However,
fluctuations in market rates or changes in credit quality may produce situations where securities
may be sold at a nominal loss in order to mitigate further erosion of principal or to reinvest
proceeds of sale in securities that will out-perform the original investment.
6.2 Competitive Bidding
RTD shall obtain competitive bid or offer information on all purchases or sales of investment
instruments on the secondary market. A competitive bid or offer can be executed through a
bidding process involving at least three separate brokers/financial institutions. If RTD is offered
a security for which there is no readily available competitive offering on the same specific issue,

Packet Pg. 30

Attachment: RTD 2023 Investment Policy.doc (4827 : 2024 Investment Policy)

No more than 50% of the Portfolio may be invested in repurchase agreements and no more
than 10% may be invested with a single counterparty. The maximum maturity for a
repurchase agreement shall be limited to 90 days.

2.16.B.a

Subject: 2024 Investment Policy
Page 8

the investment officer may document quotations for comparable or alternative securities. When
purchasing original/new issue securities, no competitive offerings will be required as all dealers in
the selling group offer those securities at the same original issue price.

The maturity of the securities in the Portfolio shall be managed with respect to the cash flow
needs of RTD and the Portfolio shall be managed to maintain a duration of three years or less.
6.4 Authorized Financial Dealers and Institutions
RTD or an investment advisor hired by RTD will maintain a list of financial institutions authorized
to provide investment services and it shall be the policy of RTD to purchase securities only from
those authorized institutions and firms. Trading counterparties shall be limited to (i) primary
dealers reporting to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, or (ii) broker/dealers that qualify under
Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15c3-1 (uniform net capital rule).
6.5 Authorized Investment Advisors
RTD may engage the services of one or more professional investment advisory firms to assist in
the management of the Portfolio. Such investment advisors may be granted discretion to
purchase and sell investment securities in accordance with this Policy and may utilize their own
approved list of broker/dealers. Such firms must be authorized to conduct business in the State
of Colorado and shall be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

7. SAFEKEEPING AND CUSTODY
7.1 Safekeeping and custody
With the exception of collateral under repurchase agreements (discussed below), all investment
securities purchased shall be held in a safekeeping account or trust custody account at a
designated third party custodian. For safekeeping accounts, the institution shall issue a
safekeeping receipt for each security, listing the specific instrument, par value, rate, CUSIP and
any other pertinent information. In addition, the safekeeping or trust custody institutions shall
provide a statement on at least a monthly basis listing all securities held in account, including
book value and market value of holdings at month-end.
For collateral (purchased securities) under repurchase agreements, RTD may utilize tri-party
repurchase agreements with an acceptable third-party custodian provided that RTD is satisfied
that it has perfected interest in the securities used as collateral, and that RTD has a properly
executed tri-party agreement.

6.3 Portfolio Duration

2.16.B.a

Subject: 2024 Investment Policy
Page 9

7.2 Delivery vs. Payment
All investment transactions will be executed on a delivery versus payment basis.

Investment reports shall be prepared on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis. Transaction
summaries shall be maintained and available in the office of the CFO or other authorized
investment personnel. Quarterly investment reports shall be submitted to the Board of Directors
and shall outline RTD’s total investment return and compare the Portfolio’s performance to a
publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics.
Staff will include an annual listing of investments held and investment returns within the Annual
Comprehensive Financial Report.
All securities holdings reports for RTD shall disclose the average maturity of the investment
portfolio.
9. PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
RTD's Portfolio is managed with the objective of obtaining a market rate of return, commensurate
with identified risk constraints and cash flow characteristics. Because the composition of the
Portfolio fluctuates, depending on market and credit conditions, various indices may be used to
monitor investment performance.
The current board-approved index for the liquidity tier of the Portfolio (cash and cash equivalents)
is the ICE BofAML 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index. For the enhanced cash portion of the Portfolio
(securities maturing between 90 days and 5 years and with a target duration of 1 year), the
designated performance benchmark is the ICE BofAML 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.
RTD recognizes that bond proceeds must be invested in accordance with Section 1.148 of the
U.S. Internal Revenue Code, related to arbitrage rebate, which limits the investment returns which
may be achieved or retained by RTD on such proceeds investments. For purposes of this Policy
“bond proceeds” shall mean proceeds from the issuance of bonds, certificates of participation or
other financial securities issued by RTD.
10. INVESTMENT POLICY REVIEW AND APPROVAL
The CFO shall conduct a review of the Policy on an annual basis and present the Policy, denoting
any changes, to the Board of Directors for approval.

1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this document is to specify the policies and procedures that support a prudent
and systematic program for investment transactions involving operating and reserve funds of the
Regional Transportation District ("RTD").
2. SCOPE
This investment policy ("Policy") applies to investment of all operating and reserve funds of the
RTD (collectively, the “Portfolio").
This Policy shall not restrict the ability of RTD to invest proceeds from the issuance of RTD
securities in financial obligations permitted through Bboard-approved bond resolutions or
indentures of trust pursuant to which the securities were issued. The standards of care dictated
for investments of other RTD funds shall also pertain to the investment of such proceeds.
3. OBJECTIVES
The objectives, in priority order, of the RTD's investment activities shall be:
3.1 Safety
Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the investment program. Investments of RTD will
be made in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the Portfolio. To attain
this objective, RTD will endeavor to mitigate credit and interest rate risks.
Credit Risk: RTD will minimize credit risk, which is the risk of loss due to the failure of the
security issuer or backer, by:
•
•

Limiting investments to the types of securities listed in the Authorized Investments
section of this Policy.
Diversifying the Portfolio in accordance with Policy limits in order to minimize the
potential for losses from any one type of security or any one individual issuer.

Interest Rate Risk: RTD will minimize interest rate risk, which is the risk that the market value
of securities in the Portfolio will fall due to changes in market interest rates, by:
Maintaining Portfolio duration appropriate to the cash flow requirements of RTD, thereby
reducing the likelihood that securities would need to be sold on the open market prior
to maturity.

3.2 Liquidity
The Portfolio will remain sufficiently liquid to enable RTD to meet all cash flow requirements
which might be reasonably anticipated. This will be achieved through maturity diversification and
purchases of securities that have an established secondary market.
3.3 Yield
The Portfolio shall be designed with the objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout
budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account the investment risk constraints, liquidity
needs, and cash flow characteristics of the Portfolio.

4. STANDARDS OF CARE
4.1 Prudence
All RTD officers and employees involved in the investment of RTD funds, along with any external
investment advisors, shall adhere to the guidance provided by the “prudent investor” standard to
insure that:
“When investing, reinvesting, purchasing, acquiring, exchanging, selling, or managing
public funds, a trustee shall act with care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the
circumstances then prevailing, including, but not limited to, the general economic
conditions and the anticipated needs of the agency, that a prudent person acting in a like
capacity and familiar with those matters would use in the conduct of funds of a like
character and with like aims, to safeguard the principal and maintain the liquidity needs of
the agency. Within the limitations of this section and considering individual investments
as part of an overall strategy, investments may be acquired as authorized by law."
RTD shall recognize that no investment is totally riskless and that the investment activities of
RTD are a matter of public record. Accordingly, it recognizes that occasional measured losses are
inevitable in a diversified portfolio and shall be considered within the context of the overall
Portfolio’s return, provided that adequate diversification has been implemented, and that the sale
of a security is in the best long-term interest of RTD.

4.2 Delegation of Authority
RTD is granted legislative authority to invest its funds pursuant to Colorado Revised Statutes,
Section 32-9-119. Management responsibility for the investment program is hereby delegated to
the General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) and her designees. The GM/CEO’s designee will
hereinafter be referred to as the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”).
RTD may, in its discretion, contract with one or more investment advisers, registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, to manage a
portion of its Portfolio assets. Any such advisor shall comply with this Policy and such other
written instructions as provided by RTD.
While it is understood that the procedures and trading counterparties of a contracted investment
adviser may differ from those of RTD, contracted investment advisers must maintain internal
controls and compliance systems at least as extensive as those of the RTD in order to assure
adequate protection of RTD assets in keeping with the standards of prudence outlined below.
4.3 Investment Procedures
The CFO shall establish written procedures for the operation of the investment program,
consistent with this Policy, which shall include explicit delegation of authority to persons
responsible for investment transactions. No person may engage in an investment transaction
except as provided under the terms of this Policy and the internal procedures established by the
CFO. Persons who are authorized to transact investment business and wire funds on behalf of
RTD are listed in Appendix 1 to this policy.
4.4 Internal Controls
The CFO shall establish a system of internal controls, which shall be reviewed annually. The
controls shall be designed to prevent loss of funds due to fraud, employee error, misrepresentation
by third parties, or imprudent actions by employees of RTD.
4.5 Ethics and Conflicts of Interest
Investment activities shall be performed in accordance with RTD’s Code of Ethics and other
policies of RTD. Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from
personal business activity that could conflict with the proper execution of the investment

Authorized investment personnel acting in accordance with this Policy and exercising due
diligence shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security’s credit risk or market
price changes, provided that deviations from expectation are reported in a timely fashion and
appropriate action is taken to control adverse developments.

5. AUTHORIZED INVESTMENTS
Authorized investments for RTD funds are specifically listed below. RTD recognizes that
investment risk can result from issuer defaults, market price changes or various technical
impediments leading to diminished liquidity or loss of capital. Portfolio risk management and
diversification are employed as a way to minimize the risks inherent in investing.
Credit Criteria: Credit criteria listed in this section refer to the credit rating at the time the security
is purchased. Rating categories defined by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations
(“NRSROs”) include intermediate rating categories. For example, the second highest rating
category (“AA”) includes bonds rated AA+, AA and AA- for Standard & Poor's and Fitch, and
Aa1, Aa2 and Aa3 for Moody's Investors Service. In the event that an issuer or security is
downgraded below the minimum rating level for any specific security that is held in the Portfolio,
the CFO will review the exposure of that security holding and will determine if it is advisable to
sell such holding.
Maturity Restrictions: Maturity restrictions shall be calculated from settlement date to maturity
date. Portfolio percentage restrictions by security type and issuer are applicable only on the date
of purchase of the investment.
Sector Diversification: The Portfolio will be limited to an aggregate exposure of 50% for the
following investment types: Municipal Bonds, Corporate Bonds, Commercial Paper, Time
Deposits/Time Certificates of Deposit and Banker's Acceptances.
1. U.S. Treasury Obligations. Obligations in the form of bills, notes, bonds or certificates of
indebtedness backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America. 100%
of the Portfolio may be invested in U.S. Treasury Obligations. The maximum maturity for
investments in U.S. Treasury Obligations shall be limited to five years.
2. Federal Agency and Instrumentality Securities: Obligations, participations or other
instruments of any Federal agency, instrumentality or United States government-sponsored
enterprise as described in CRS 24-75-601.1(1)(b) (an “Agency” or “Agencies”). Such
securities shall be rated in one of the two highest rating categories (as described above in
the Credit Criteria section) by at least two NRSROs. No more than 75% of the Portfolio
may be invested in Federal Agency and Instrumentality Securities, with no more than 25%

program, or which could impair their ability to make impartial investment decisions. Employees
and investment officials shall disclose to the GM/CEO any material financial interests in financial
institutions that conduct business with RTD, and they shall further disclose any large
personal/financial/investment positions that could be related to the performance of the Portfolio.

more than 50% of the Portfolio.
6. INVESTMENT PARAMETERS
6.1 Sale of Securities
RTD does not make investments for the purpose of trading or speculation, but, rather, with the
prevalent intent to hold securities to maturity. The prohibition of speculative investment precludes
pursuit of profit through unusual risk or conjectural fluctuations in market prices. However,
fluctuations in market rates or changes in credit quality may produce situations where securities
may be sold at a nominal loss in order to mitigate further erosion of principal or to reinvest
proceeds of sale in securities that will out-perform the original investment.
6.2 Competitive Bidding
RTD shall obtain competitive bid or offer information on all purchases or sales of investment
instruments on the secondary market. A competitive bid or offer can be executed through a
bidding process involving at least three separate brokers/financial institutions. If RTD is offered
a security for which there is no readily available competitive offering on the same specific issue,

Packet Pg. 42

Attachment: RTD 2023 Investment Policy Red Line (4827 : 2024 Investment Policy)

No more than 50% of the Portfolio may be invested in repurchase agreements and no more
than 10% may be invested with a single counterparty. The maximum maturity for a
repurchase agreement shall be limited to 90 days.

2.16.B.b

Subject: 20243 Investment Policy
Page 8

the investment officer may document quotations for comparable or alternative securities. When
purchasing original/new issue securities, no competitive offerings will be required as all dealers in
the selling group offer those securities at the same original issue price.

The maturity of the securities in the Portfolio shall be managed with respect to the cash flow
needs of RTD and the Portfolio shall be managed to maintain a duration of three years or less.
6.4 Authorized Financial Dealers and Institutions
RTD or an investment advisor hired by RTD will maintain a list of financial institutions authorized
to provide investment services and it shall be the policy of RTD to purchase securities only from
those authorized institutions and firms. Trading counterparties shall be limited to (i) primary
dealers reporting to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, or (ii) broker/dealers that qualify under
Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15c3-1 (uniform net capital rule).
6.5 Authorized Investment Advisors
RTD may engage the services of one or more professional investment advisory firms to assist in
the management of the Portfolio. Such investment advisors may be granted discretion to
purchase and sell investment securities in accordance with this Policy and may utilize their own
approved list of broker/dealers. Such firms must be authorized to conduct business in the State
of Colorado and shall be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

7. SAFEKEEPING AND CUSTODY
7.1 Safekeeping and custody
With the exception of collateral under repurchase agreements (discussed below), all investment
securities purchased shall be held in a safekeeping account or trust custody account at a
designated third party custodian. For safekeeping accounts, the institution shall issue a
safekeeping receipt for each security, listing the specific instrument, par value, rate, CUSIP and
any other pertinent information. In addition, the safekeeping or trust custody institutions shall
provide a statement on at least a monthly basis listing all securities held in account, including
book value and market value of holdings at month-end.
For collateral (purchased securities) under repurchase agreements, RTD may utilize tri-party
repurchase agreements with an acceptable third-party custodian provided that RTD is satisfied
that it has perfected interest in the securities used as collateral, and that RTD has a properly
executed tri-party agreement.

7.2 Delivery vs. Payment
All investment transactions will be executed on a delivery versus payment basis.

Investment reports shall be prepared on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis. Transaction
summaries shall be maintained and available in the office of the CFO or other authorized
investment personnel. Quarterly investment reports shall be submitted to the Board of Directors
and shall outline RTD’s total investment return and compare the Portfolio’s performance to a
publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics.
Staff will include an annual listing of investments held and investment returns within the Annual
Comprehensive Financial Report.
All securities holdings reports for RTD shall disclose the average maturity of the investment
portfolio.
9. PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
RTD's Portfolio is managed with the objective of obtaining a market rate of return, commensurate
with identified risk constraints and cash flow characteristics. Because the composition of the
Portfolio fluctuates, depending on market and credit conditions, various indices may be used to
monitor investment performance.
The current board-approved index for the liquidity tier of the Portfolio (cash and cash equivalents)
is the ICE BofAML 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index. For the enhanced cash portion of the Portfolio
(securities maturing between 90 days and 5 years and with a target duration of 1 year), the
designated performance benchmark is the ICE BofAML 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.
RTD recognizes that bond proceeds must be invested in accordance with Section 1.148 of the
U.S. Internal Revenue Code, related to arbitrage rebate, which limits the investment returns which
may be achieved or retained by RTD on such proceeds investments. For purposes of this Policy
“bond proceeds” shall mean proceeds from the issuance of bonds, certificates of participation or
other financial securities issued by RTD.
10. INVESTMENT POLICY REVIEW AND APPROVAL
The CFO shall conduct a review of the Policy on an annual basis and present the Policy, denoting
any changes, to the Board of Directors for approval.

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
Each year staff presents for the Board’s consideration the proposed Fiscal Policy for the upcoming fiscal
year. The Fiscal Policy may be amended by the Board at any time.
The most recent modification to the Fiscal Policy was approved by the Board of Directors in October
2022 for the 2023 fiscal year.
DISCUSSION
Modifications to the Fiscal Policy for 2024 include the following:
•
•
•

•
•
•

Minor grammatical changes
Relocation of an existing reference to preparation of a Mid-term Financial Plan in the Capital
Improvement Policies section to the Budget Policies section
Clarification in the Fund Balance Policies section to allow for additional debt to fund the Transit
Asset Management (TAM) Plan in which:
o Doing so would be financially advantageous for cash flow purposes, or
o The investment returns on available funds exceeds the cost of debt
Relocation of the reference to maintaining a minimum net revenue coverage ratio from the Debt
Policies section to the Budget Policies section
Modification of the amended budget phrasing in the Budget Policies section in alignment with
RTD’s intent to no longer plan to complete an amended budget annually unless necessary
A change in terminology from a reference to the annual preparation of a six-year Mid-term
Financial Plan to that of a Five-year Financial Forecast. This change is being made to be more
descriptive of the financial planning process and changing from six-years to five years due to a
five-year forecast being in alignment with common industry practices. The financial forecast
terminology will be changed to the Five-year Financial Forecast from the Mid-term Financial Plan

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
2024-2029 Mid-term Financial Plan (MTFP)

October 3, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
October 24, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt the 2024-2029 Mid-term Financial Plan (MTFP).
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
Todd Nikkel, Senior Manager, Budget
BACKGROUND
The 2024-2029 MTFP is the six-year financial forecast used as the basis for the development of the
2024 Budget and provides guidance for future year financial planning. The development of this forecast
seeks to balance planned expenditures with anticipated available funding sources in alignment with
RTD’s Strategic Plan. Adoption of the 2024-2029 MTFP by the Board is not a commitment or
appropriation of funding.
DISCUSSION
The 2024-2029 MTFP projects that the agency’s forecasted revenues and reserves are sufficient to
meet expected operational, debt service and asset management expenditures while maintaining reserves
as required by the Board approved RTD Fiscal Policy. While RTD’s financial position is forecasted to
meet the Strategic Priority of Financial Success through 2029, vigilance will be required to ensure the
agency maintains activities within the projected fiscal constraints. The 2024-2029 MTFP was developed
in consideration of a prudent, fiscally sustainable approach including provisions such as restrained sales
and use tax growth projections resulting from Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TABOR) implications. The result of
this forecast is a presentation of a fiscally conservative plan that allows for agility and scalability over
the six-year period.
Beginning in FY 2024, RTD will pivot to a five-year mid-term planning cycle in alignment with common
public and private industry practices, leveraging a document that will be known as the Five-year
Financial Forecast.
2024-2029 MTFP Assumptions
• Fare revenue is based on current trends in ridership as well as the Systemwide Fare Study and
Equity Analysis provisions. Ridership is forecast to increase 9.7% in 2024 due to lower fares and
increase 2.0% annually thereafter. A modest fare increase is assumed in 2027 subject to
additional future discussions.
• Sales and use tax projections provided in August 2023 by the University of Colorado Leeds
School of Business project a $19.4 million decrease over the March 2023 forecast. The decrease

Packet Pg. 62

2.16.D

•
•
•

is primarily due to weaker collections during 2023. Additionally, staff further reduced the
forecasted decrease for the Base System growth by capping annually at 1.4% after 2024 for
TABOR limits resulting in an overall decrease to forecasted sales and use tax revenues of $31.7
million. The 1.4% Base System growth assumption matches the assumptions from Reimagine
RTD in which growth was capped at the growth rate of property taxes in alignment with TABOR
revenue growth limits.
Operating expenses increase at an annual rate of 5.1% over the six-year MTFP period due to
inflationary assumptions. Limited increases to headcount are assumed.
Asset management expenditures are included that maintain assets in a state of good repair based
on current information.
Reserves are projected to increase $202 million during the six-year MTFP to ensure that operating
reserves of three months expenses and a capital replacement fund are maintained as required by
fiscal policies.

Current Outlook
• The 2024-2029 period balances funding sources and uses while maintaining reserves
• Service levels reflect the System Optimization Plan requirements
• Funding of full asset management backlog plus reserves for future needs
• Debt service coverage ratio policy of 1.2x is met each year
• Reserves of three months operating expenses met in each year
• Limited new projects are included
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The 2024-2029 MTFP projects balanced funding sources and uses while meeting asset management
needs and fiscal policy requirements for reserves and debt service coverage ratios.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
GM/CEO Compensation Base Salary Range

October 16, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
October 25, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) Base Salary
Compensation Range
REPRESENTATIVE
Erik Davidson, Performance Committee Chair
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 minutes
BACKGROUND
On September 20, 2020, RTD and General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) Debra A. Johnson entered into
a five-year employment agreement (Agreement). The Agreement sets forth her compensation and
benefits, as well as a program by which the Board, in consultation with Ms. Johnson, establishes
performance goals and metrics, annually evaluates her performance, and utilizes a framework for
determining future incentive awards and increases to base salary subject to her meeting or exceeding
these goals. The Agreement has been amended by the parties four times, with the most recent
amendment adopted by the Board on October 25, 2022. The Third Amendment to the Agreement
provides that RTD will engage a third party by competitive solicitation to conduct a compensation and
benchmarking analysis that will be used by the Board in consultation with GM/CEO Johnson to
determine her compensation for performance periods beginning January 1, 2023.
Following a competitive solicitation, Gallagher Benefit Services, Inc. (Gallagher) was selected to conduct
a comprehensive and systematic benchmarking analysis of the total compensation package for the
GM/CEO, including both external market-based factors and internal equity considerations, to ensure
competitiveness in pay practices. This analysis intended to inform the Board in its decisions on
compensation for the GM/CEO position relative to market considerations. The results of the study were
presented to the Performance Committee on November 16, 2022.
On September 26, 2023, the Board approved its Compensation Philosophy for the GM/CEO, which
outlines principles to guide the components of the GM/CEO’s total compensation, including the
following:
•

Demonstrate internal equity, fairness, and transparency while being externally market
competitive, aligned to the 50th percentile of comparable public transit agencies and related
public and private sectors where executive talent may reside

Packet Pg. 75

2.16.E

•

Be reviewed for market competitiveness and legislative/regulatory compliance (local, state, and
federal) on an annual basis

During the October 2, 2023, Performance Committee (Committee) meeting, Committee members having
reviewed the Gallagher study considered the recommended GM/CEO Base Salary Range based on the full
market data of comparable organizations as follows:
The Committee noted that the data used to establish the recommended base salary range was nearly 12
months old. Consequently, to remain competitive with the market, an aging factor was recommended to
account for market changes that may have occurred since the November 2022 report resulting in a
recommended adjusted GM/CEO Base Salary Range of:
•

Minimum: $292,600 Midpoint: $402,325 Maximum: $512,050

The Employment Cost Index (ECI) measures changes in the cost of employees to employers over time. In
the private sector, business owners and human resources professionals can use the ECI to make
decisions about pay adjustments to help them stay competitive. In the public sector, the Federal Reserve
and others use the ECI to gauge the health of the labor market, adjust contracts, and research the labor
market. (Source: US Bureau of Labor Statistics)
DISCUSSION
In adopting this recommended action, the Board honors the intent of the Compensation Philosophy for
the GM/CEO and establishes a market competitive base salary range designed to attract and retain a
GM/CEO with the required suite of competencies, knowledge, and experience to lead and inspire an
innovative, complex, and unique multi-modal transit agency.
Further, in adopting this recommended action, the Board will honor its commitment to establishing a
base compensation range for the GM/CEO position, consistent with the 2010 State Audit on Executive
Compensation Practice and will bring the agency into alignment with its wage transparency obligations
under the Colorado Equal Pay for Equal Work Act.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Establishing a base salary range for the GM/CEO position does not automatically equate to a change in
the current GM/CEO's base compensation, as that is governed by the existing term contract.

STUDY BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
Purpose of Study and Study Scope
In the spring of 2022, RTD issued a request for proposal to conduct a compensation study for
RTD covering the transportation industry GM/CEO positions. This study includes collecting
market data using a custom survey and published survey sources to analyze and evaluate all
data in an objective manner and make recommendations designed to assist RTD in attracting,
recruiting, and retaining top performing talent. Specifically, the identified project objectives were:




Identify and document the basis for selection of minimum of ten comparable agencies for
external benchmarking to include a comparison to equivalent positions with similar function,
scope, and a comparison to agencies with the transit industry, comparable governmental
entities, and comparable geographic markets.
Conduct independent external total compensation survey (base salary, incentive pay, paid
leave, benefits, and pension), compile data, and perform external benchmarking analysis.



Collect market salary data utilizing custom and published survey sources (where applicable);



Analyze market base compensation (actual pay and pay ranges) for benchmark jobs to
evaluate market competitiveness;



Conduct internal equity assessment of GM/CEO total compensation as compared to non –
represented RTD employees;



Recommend a base salary range and market midpoint for the GM/CEO position.



Present findings reflecting total compensation market research, benchmarking and internal
equity analysis and recommendations to RTD Board Performance and full Board of
Directors.

In spring 2022, Gallagher submitted a proposal to RTD to perform the work requested and the
work began in October 2022. Below are the specific phase activities of the project as identified
and submitted in the proposal and agreed upon by Gallagher consultants and RTD.

RTD Compensation System
RTD currently does not have a salary schedule for all the GM/CEO position. RTD has
recognized that as time has progressed and changes in the economy and labor market have
taken place, the need for a GM/CEO salary schedule has become apparent; one that will help
RTD to be more attractive to prospective and current employees.

STUDY PROCESS
In October 2022, Gallagher consultants met with RTD’ Project manager. The purpose of the
meeting was to:



Review the presentation and to discuss coordination for the upcoming employee information
sessions;
Discuss market comparators for the custom survey;



Confirm subordinate positions for equity pay;



Confirm the project timeline;



Discuss RTD Denver’s current GM/CEO total compensation;



Discuss expectations for final report and presentation.

At the end of the meeting, Gallagher consultants and RTD project manager were clear on the
timeline, information needed from RTD to conduct the study, deliverables and how to approach
the upcoming project phases.
.
In early October 2022, RTD provided a list of 20 comparator organizations being used in connection to
parallel compensation study for non-represented employees. Gallagher consultants reviewed the list
and confirmed that these were comparable agencies. The comparators selected, were identified and
chosen based on a variety of factors to include:

In mid-October, the data collection form (survey) containing the GM/CEO benchmark job was
sent to RTD for its review, consideration, and approval. On October 18, 2022, RTD approved
the data collection form (survey) to be sent to the comparator organizations. The survey was
then sent to the comparator organizations with a requested submission date of November 31,
2022. During the survey completion timeframe, Gallagher and RTD made several follow-up
emails and phone calls to the comparator organizations to solicit participation and to answer any
questions the comparator organizations had about the survey or study.

cuts where possible for cross-industry jobs). The combination of the custom survey and
published market data is reflected in the findings and recommendations detailed at the end of
this report.
Throughout the study, Gallagher consultants met regularly with RTD Project Team to discuss
milestones, needs, deliverables, and any concerns.

STUDY FINDINGS
In October 2022, with the responses to the custom survey received, market data collected from
published survey sources, and to provide RTD with preliminary cost for upcoming budget
deliberations, Gallagher consultants met with RTD’ Project manager to review the preliminary
compensation analysis and results.
Salary Comparisons
Custom and Published Survey Data Collection and Analysis
Of the twenty comparator organizations identified and surveyed, Gallagher summarized
responses from 13 out of 20 (65%) organizations invited to participate in the survey. The custom
survey was supplemented with published survey data representative of the public and private
sector.
Gallagher reviewed and analyzed the obtained published and custom survey data using
statistical tools and sought clarification with the participating organizations to validate matches
for those jobs where the data seemed to be an outlier. Gallagher follows the U.S Department of
Justice and Federal Trade Commission guidelines, which states five job matches should exist
per job to conduct statistical analyses or draw conclusions.

Geographic Adjustments and Aging Market Salary Data
Two important adjustments made to the data was to account for the differences in the cost of
labor for the Denver, Colorado as compared to other areas within the United States as well as
aging of the published survey data forward to account for pay changes that may have occurred
during the study timeframe. Aging factors were not applied to the custom survey market salary
data. It represents current effective salaries at participant organizations.
The cost of labor refers to the difference in pay or labor market for a job from one location to
another. The cost of labor is what a particular geographic market offers as the “going rate” or
compensation for its jobs and reflects the local demand for and supply of labor. Thus, if market
data were collected from a particular geographic location, they were adjusted downward/upward
based on Colorado’s cost of labor differential.

Market Comparison Results
Once all data were collected, reviewed, and analyzed for alignment with RTD’ benchmark jobs,
Gallagher compared RTD’ actual salaries for GM/CEO position with the market data collected. The
difference from the market for each benchmark is calculated as follows:


RTD data minus Market data divided by the market data:
– A positive figure indicates that RTD pay above the market.
– A negative figure indicates that RTD pay below the market.

The following guidelines were used when determining the competitive nature of RTD’ current
compensation:

Following the standard compensation guidelines outlined above, RTD GM/CEO salary is
competitive with the 50th percentile full market at -3%.
More specifically, further analysis of the full market (custom and published survey public and
private sector data combined) revealed that:


RTD pay is highly competitive with the full market (50%),

o



Significantly above the lowest levels of the full market (25%).
Competitive with leading salaries with the custom industry survey (75%),

A variance greater than +/- 15% difference with the market is significantly misaligned. Such
variance does not necessarily mean misalignment. Factors such as performance, turnover
and longevity impact actual salaries and may explain some of the differences between RTD
and the market actual salaries for individual jobs

Proposed Salary Range Adjustments
To analyze the competitiveness of the pay and propose a pay range for the RTD GM/CEO job,
Gallagher reviewed the market to identify potential impact of job placement and implementation
costs:


We proposed a salary schedule by comparing the market 50th percentile of actual pay to
create a pay grade midpoint and structure.



This is based on the general assumption that most organizations typically build
competitive salary structure ranges for hiring and retention by anchoring the structure at
the market 50th percentile (or median) of actual salaries or based on compensation
philosophy to support recruitment and retention.

To keep up with competitive market hiring and retention, we recommend RTD review the
proposed pay grade (closest pay grade aligned to the full market 50th actual salary)
based on internal factors such as comparable positions in the current pay grade, career levels,
supervisor-subordinate relationships.
Implementation Options
It is important for RTD to implement the proposed GM/CEO salary range adjustments through a
consistent pay implementation process to reduce potential salary compression issues and
impact of inflation.
Cost implementation analysis (provided there is a change) includes employee pay adjustments
within the current or recommended range based on GM/CEO current pay rate and years of
service in position

Internal Pay Equity Analysis Summary

Identifying Pay Compression

Goal

Internal pay equity assessment of GM/CEO’s total compensation as compared
to non-represented RTD employees.

Methodology

Best practice of 20% differential between the supervisor's pay and the
subordinate's pay.

Findings

The total compensation of the GM/CEO is equitable compared to nonrepresented RTD employees.

Internal Pay Equity Assessment
•
•

•
•
•

•

Gallagher determined that the total compensation of the GM/CEO is equitable.
Gallagher determined that the base salary of the GM/CEO is 37% higher than
the highest paid subordinate employee.
• Formula used: Supervisor pay - Subordinates pay ÷ Subordinates pay
Additional compensation and perquisites provided to the GM/CEO include deferred
comp and incentive awards.
These are all considered reasonable and consistent with that provided by peer
organizations.
RTD does not appear to provide vehicle allowance, club membership,
supplemental retirement, executive long-term disability (LTD) supplemental life
insurance, employer paid retiree health insurance, and/or disability insurance to
the GM/CEO, which are common elements of the total compensation package
provided to comparator industry GM/CEOs.
Determine if subordinates are paid equitably compared to their supervisor.

The compensation paid to the General Manager/ Chief Executive Officer (GM/CEO) has been
compared against the compensation data from comparable organizations in this report. Our findings
indicate that the total compensation paid to the GM/CEO is competitive with the market when
compared with comparable organizations. This level of compensation should be considered
reasonable with potential opportunities to increase overall compensation with market trends.
Should the GM/CEO pay increase to the market median, it would still be reasonable.
1. The Custom Survey data showed that the GM/CEO was competitive (+/-10%) with
the market median salary in comparison to the GM/CEO in the
comparator organizations.
2. The Published survey data showed that the GM/CEO was possibly misaligned (+/10-15%) with the market median salary.
3. The Full Market data (Custom and Published) showed that the GM/CEO was
competitive (+/-10%) with the market median salary.

The recommended salary range to RTD’ GM/CEO based on the full market data of comparable
organizations is:

Minimum- $280,000 Midpoint- $385,000 Maximum- $490,000

The implementation strategy/plan is based on the following aspects:



Employees will be paid within the new pay range, meaning the employee will not be paid
below the minimum.



The salary does not fall above the new pay range maximum.



Recommend continued movement of current employee through the range, based on the
highly competitive talent market of senior and executive leadership.



Conduct regular review of GM/CEO compensation and relevant market data to ensure
that a competitive salary is maintained and to ensure reasonability of executive pay.



Update GM/CEO range to remain competitive to the market on biennial to annual basis.

Next Steps and Recommendations
The following next steps are being recommended to RTD upon the conclusion of the
compensation study:


RTD adopts the Gallagher proposed GM/CEO salary range and the supporting strategies
based on the data received and analysis performed;



RTD determines the timeframe and/or phases for implementing the Gallagher proposed
GM/CEO salary range, implementation options and any proposed changes to benefits
(immediate, phase in over 2 year, 3 years, etc.).

Ongoing Administration
Gallagher recommends that pay administration guidelines should be implemented for placing
and moving the GM/CEO employee through the proposed salary range. Based on this, and in
closing, we recommend the following:


Looking ahead, conduct regular reviews of the compensation system and relevant market
data to ensure that a competitiveness with the market is maintained:
o
o
o

The GM/CEO salary range should be adjusted by a structure movement trend factor
every year to remain competitive with the market.
The GM/CEO overall benefits should be analyzed and adjusted by using a market
trend comparison regularly to remain competitive with the market.
Advance GM/CEO incumbent pay through the assigned pay range based on time in
position or longevity to mitigate compression, while also considering overall
performance. This ensures the following:




Actual pay for new hire GM/CEO subordinates are differentiated by minimum
20% lower than GM/CEO pay.
The more tenured GM/CEO becomes, the closer their pay rate is aligned to
market target rate.
Refine the RTD Compensation Philosophy and its gradual and/or immediate
implementation.

CONCLUSION & GOING FORWARD
The report presents independent data to guide and inform future compensation decisions as per
the “safe harbor” provision of the intermediate Sanctions law. As part of this study, it is the intent
to provide the board with information intended to assist them in determining if total
compensation paid to the GM/CEO is more than “reasonable compensation” in accordance with
Section 4958 (intermediate Sanctions) of the internal Revenue Code. This is a
standard/regulation by which our practice follows in considering executive compensation for
public sector and higher education clients.
The current pay for the GM/CEO is reasonable. RTD compensation level for the GM/CEO is
competitive compared to similar executive jobs in the market. This level of compensation should
also be considered reasonable with potential opportunities to increase overall compensation
with market trends.
Compensation is often seen as a major reason executive like the RTD GM/CEO go to work for
an organization and remain employed by them. Through the study, RTD can design a long-term
compensation strategy that will enable the organization to move forward, attract and retain their
leadership well into the future.
Gallagher is prepared to support RTD in its compensation efforts by responding to requests for
advice, support, and services from RTD’ management staff. We are available via email,
telephone and can be on-site.
