BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Paul J. Ballard, Interim General Manager and
CEO

Date: August 4, 2020

From:

Fred Worthen, Assistant General Manager of
Bus Operations

GM

Date:

August 4, 2020

Board Meeting Date: August 18, 2020

Subject:

Award of Wagon Road, Broomfield
Evergreen Contracted FlexRide Services

and

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into a contract with Via Mobility Services (Via)
for the provision of contracted Wagon Road, Broomfield and Evergreen FlexRide transit services. This
contract is for two years, with no option years. The first-year contract amount for service is $981,288
and the second-year is $894,366 for a total not-to-exceed amount of $1,875,654. In addition, RTD will
reimburse the contractor’s direct fuel costs in an amount estimated to be $113,305 for contract year
one and $106,010 for contract year two, for a total not-to-exceed amount of $219,316 for the twoyear contract term. The total two-year not-to-exceed amount for the FlexRide service and fuel is
$2,094,970.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services
Core Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management
BACKGROUND:
Originally mandated in 1988 by Senate Bill 88-164 and revised by other legislative activities over the
years, RTD is obligated to “implement a system under which up to fifty-eight percent of the district’s
vehicular service is provided by qualified private businesses pursuant to competitively negotiated
contracts.” RTD currently outsources approximately 45% of its fixed-route service, 100% of its ADA
paratransit service (Access-a-Ride), and 100% of its general public demand response service (FlexRide).
The total amount of vehicular service currently contracted out is close to 56%.
On June 18, 2020, a Request for Proposals (RFP) 120-FH-015 named Wagon Road, Broomfield and
Evergreen Services (“WGBFEV”) was issued soliciting proposals for the provision of demand response
transit services. The “WGBFEV” service package replaces the current Wagon Road and Broomfield
contracts, which will expire on September 30, 2020, and the current Evergreen contract, which will
expire on December 31, 2020. The service package consists of 8 FlexRide vehicles operating in three
service areas providing approximately 18,777 revenue hours per year. A summary of the service areas
included in “WGBFEV” is included as Attachment A. Responses to the Request for Proposals were due
on July 15, 2020. Proposers were required to provide detailed operating plans for providing demand
response service, including hiring and training employees, maintaining RTD-provided transit vehicles, and
conforming to RTD operating requirements. The contract award was anticipated to be awarded on a
fixed-price basis and based on “best value” competitive proposal procedures.

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

DISCUSSION:
This recommendation represents the most responsive and responsible proposal received in response to
Request for Proposals (RFP) 120-FH-015 to provide “WGBFEV” Public Transportation Services. The
contract to provide this service is scheduled to be effective on October 1, 2020 (Wagon Road and
Broomfield) and January 1, 2021 (Evergreen).
PROCUREMENT:
Two (2) proposals were received from Via Mobility Services (Via) and Denver Limousine in response to
RFP 120-FH-015 for the Provision of “WGBFEV” Public Transportation Services. All proposals were
evaluated on the following evaluative criteria:
a) understanding/approach and organization for
implementation (35%); b) experience/qualifications and safety record (30%); c) price (30%); and d) SBE
plan and goal attainment (5%).
The technical evaluation team reviewed and scored each proposal based on a) understanding/approach
and organization for implementation and b) experience/qualifications and safety record. The technical
evaluation team consisted of Brian Matthews, Manager, Special Services; Erin Vallejos, Manager,
Competitive Services; Eric Castillo, Senior Quality Control Inspector, Maintenance; and Pat Heye, Senior
Alternative Service Planner/Scheduler.
The SBE plan and goal attainment was reviewed and scored by Jose Chirinos, Compliance Officer, SBO.
The proposal pricing was reviewed and scored by the Procurement Department staff.
“WGBFEV” PROPOSALS:
Via - The following is a summary of the strong points of the Via “WGBFEV” proposal which support the
recommendation of contract award to Via:
Facility. Located at 2855 North 63rd Street in Boulder and 6500 Franklin Street in Denver, these
facilities are centrally located in close proximity the Wagon Road and Broomfield service areas. For the
Evergreen service area, while Via is still seeking to lease space in a secured parking lot, they have an
agreement in place to use the facility of the current service provider, Seniors’ Resource Center, until a
new space is secured. All three facilities are already fully functional so there will be no disruption of
service or added start-up costs when transitioning from the previous contracts to the new “WGBFEV”
contract.
Maintenance Program. Via has a well-established maintenance program and prior experience maintaining
the vehicles provided under this contract. The Boulder and Denver facilities already have all necessary
equipment for properly maintaining the vehicles so there will be no disruption of service or added startup costs while transitioning from the previous contracts.
Recruitment and Training. As the current provider of these FlexRide services, Via already has drivers on
staff and trained to provide this service. They have a thorough and proven training program that will
allow them to provide continuity for on-going operations.
Proposed Management Team. Under this team’s leadership, Via successfully delivers paratransit and
FlexRide service for RTD throughout the District. The team has developed and nurtured positive and
productive relationships with RTD, surrounding governments and communities. The following is a brief
description of the experience for the Key Personnel assigned to the new “WGBFEV” contract:
•

Proposed General Manager: Has 3.5 years’ experience as a General/Project Manager for RTD

Packet Pg. 4

1.B.1

FlexRide services and a total of 12 years’ transportation experience.
•

Proposed Operations Manager: Has 5 years’ experience as an Operations Manager and a total of
17 years’ experience within the transportation industry.

•

Proposed Maintenance Manager: Has 30 years’ experience as a Maintenance Manager. In total,
has over of 42 years’ experience in fleet management.

•

Proposed Human Resources Manager: Has 16 years’ experience as a Human Resources Manager
with 13 years’ FlexRide experience.

•

Proposed Safety/Training Manager: Has 12 years’ experience as a Safety and Training Manager
with 2 years’ transportation experience.

Experience of Firm. Via has been providing services for RTD for almost 25 years in addition to providing
other private demand response services within the community since 1979.
SBE goal set at 5%. Via’s proposed SBE plan meets the 5% goal.
The technical evaluation team requested further clarification on a few items which were adequately
addressed by VIA.
Denver Limousine - The following is a summary of the Denver Limousine “WGBFEV” proposal that does
not support the recommendation of contract award to Denver Limousine:
Milestones. Denver Limousine did not provide a schedule as to how the milestones would be met.
Start-up and Transition Plan. Denver Limousine did not provide a start-up or transition plan.
Maintenance. Denver Limousine did not provide a detailed maintenance plan.
Hiring and Retention Strategy. Denver Limousine did not provide a detailed hiring or retention plan.
Training. Denver Limousine did not provide a detailed training calendar or components that would make
up the training.
Management Team. The proposed Denver Limousine local management team did not meet the minimum
qualification requirements set forth in the “WGBFEV” RFP.
Cost. Denver Limousine’s proposed price is $1,167,730 more than the price proposed by Via.
For the reasons noted above the technical evaluation team determined that it was not in the best
interest of RTD to pursue any further action with Denver Limousine.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
RTD Special Services Internal Cost Estimate:
This estimate was prepared by the Special Services Department to anticipate the amount RTD could

Packet Pg. 5

1.B.1

expect to pay to outsource the “WGBFEV” service package to a contract operator. RTD anticipated
proposers would implement a competitive wage structure that was in line with the local labor market
as well as an increase for inflation. RTD Special Services total two-year estimate for the “WGBFEV”
service package was $2,055,233.
Via’s proposed total price was $1,875,654. Via’s price proposal for Wagon Road and Broomfield
matches the variable hourly rate for the rest of the northern metro FlexRides they currently operate
and does not include any additional overhead. The Evergreen variable hourly rate proposed by Via is
15% lower than the rate of the current service provider.
Denver Limousine’s proposed total price was $3,043,383. Denver Limousine’s price proposal was
not considered further since their proposed price was significantly higher than RTD would expect to
pay for the “WGBFEV” service package.
Below is a breakdown of the RTD Special Services estimate and price proposals received.

($179,579)
$998,150

The Via total two-year proposed price represents a $179,579 (9%) savings over the RTD estimated
cost of the service. The Wagon Road and Broomfield FlexRide services are grant funded and were
almost equal to RTD’s internal cost estimate. The Evergreen FlexRide service represents a 17%
savings over RTD’s internal cost estimate. Funds for the provision of the 2020 portion of the first
year of service under this contract were included in the 2020 RTD budget. Funds will be requested
in future budgets for the provision of service in future years.
RECOMMENDATION:
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into a contract with Via Mobility Services
(Via) for the provision of contracted Wagon Road, Broomfield and Evergreen FlexRide transit
services. This contract is for two years, with no option years. The first-year contract amount for
service is $981,288 and the second-year is $894,366 for a total not-to-exceed amount of
$1,875,654. In addition, RTD will reimburse the contractor’s direct fuel costs in an amount
estimated to be $113,305 for contract year one and $106,010 for contract year two, for a total notto-exceed amount of $219,316 for the two-year contract term. The total two-year not-to-exceed
amount for the FlexRide service and fuel is $2,094,970.

Safety

Added to Committee Agenda as a Director initiated request pursuant to RTD Board Bylaws Art. VI,
Section 1(f). Requires formal motion and second at Committee meeting.
MOTION
It is recommended by Directors Lewis, Walker, and Williams that the Board of Directors approve the
Resolution No. _____, Series of 2020.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #2 – Strong and Ethical Leadership
BACKGROUND
The Board of Directors have had discussion regarding the challenges regarding the safety and security
for our patrons. There are ongoing concerns regarding our unhoused neighbors utilizing our rolling stock
for shelters and our staff being ill-equipped to address the social, behavioral, or mental health needs of
our patrons.
This is an opportunity to create a harmonious approach to those that are in need of resources.
DISCUSSION
Currently RTD Safety and Security is staffed via a multi-million dollar contract with Allied Universal
Security and supplemented by RTD Transit Security Officers and secondary employment police officers
from local jurisdictions, whose collaboration with RTD is secured via inter-governmental agreements with
the Denver Police Department, the City of Arvada, and the Aurora Police Department.
The agency has used Allied Universal Security personnel to fulfill the role of a second qualified crew
members on each commuter rail train, per the Federal Railroad Administration for the Emergency
Preparedness Plan. While the agency has utilized armed security in this way, armed security on each
train is not required per 49 CFR § 239.101, Subpart B- Specific Requirements Emergency Preparedness
Plan.
As of May 11, 2020, as a result of a partnership with the Mental Health Center of Denver (MHCD), the
agency now has one full-time certified rehabilitation practitioner, whose responsibility to contact
passengers in Denver who may need mental health support or medical intervention, as well as follow-up
with individuals to ensure continued support. This joint effort provides support to riders who may not
have access to, or knowledge of, available mental health services.

Packet Pg. 11

1.B.2

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Current budget allocation for safety and security is broken out as follows, 17 million allocated for the
Allied Security Contract for 2019, with an increase to 22 million for 2020 and beyond.
Intergovernmental agreements allocate 5.3 million for off-duty police officers/second employee and 3.8
million for our internal police resources.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Approve the resolution.
2. Reject the resolution. Given current national discussion, the above-mentioned Directors would not
recommend this option.

Attachment: Service Availability Memo - July 2020 (4301 : Service Availability July 2020)

TO:

RTD fixed-route bus operations provided slightly over 99.84% of all scheduled hours of bus
service in July 2020. Lost service hours for personnel related reasons, reflects an
improvement as compared to the same month (July) last year. Lost service for personnel
related reasons follows:
•
•
•
•

July 2020 – 14.68 hours
June 2019 – 149.17 hours
Year to date hours for 2020 – 1566.28 hours
Year to date hours 2019 – 2404.21 hours

Contributing to our service/staffing challenges in July were bus bridges and the COVID-19
pandemic and the pandemic service reduction.
While RTD did provide in excess of 99.84% of all scheduled hours of service in the month,
it was necessary to cover 0 shifts with RTD operators working a 6th day (one of their
scheduled days off). This represents approximately 0 hours of service being provided by a
“6th day” RTD operator. Additionally, our contractor partners, First Transit and TransDev,
covered 0 shifts, or approximately 0 hours of service, with operators working a “6th day”.
