BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Monthly Government Relations Report – June 2025

June 18, 2025

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Davies, Government Relations Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
Pursuant to the Board-adopted 2025 Legislative Program, the agency developed a Legislative Program
that serves as a guiding document for staff to pursue goals related to legislative and policy matters. A
Legislative Program serves as a living document that can be adjusted throughout a legislative session to
provide an avenue for Board adopted policy positions to be communicated and pursued by agency staff.
In line with the agency’s mission and vision established in the Strategic Plan, the development and
inclusion of the goals and actions contained in the Legislative Program are designed to make lives better
through connections.
It is important that RTD serve as a trusted partner to the region’s local, state, and federal elected
officials. To achieve these goals, Board members and staff must be proactive in educating and informing
the District’s elected officials of the challenges and opportunities available to advance shared goals.
In furtherance of the program, the agency’s Government Relations Officer coordinates and develops
strategic communications to advance the agency’s legislative priorities and serve as a point of contact
for elected officials in the Denver metro region.
DISCUSSION
Included herein are notable government relations highlights at the federal, state, and local levels since
the last Executive Committee meeting held on Thursday, May 22, 2025. This report was prepared on
June 9, 2025, and will be updated verbally as needed during the Executive Committee meeting
scheduled for Wednesday, Jume 18 2025.
Federal
At the federal level, Congress continues to work on a reconciliation package, which was passed through
the House of Representatives and is being considered in the U.S. Senate currently. The goal is for the
Senate to approve the legislation by July 4, 2025.

Packet Pg. 32

On May 30, 2025, President Trump submitted the White House budget request for federal fiscal year
2026 to Congress for consideration. Public transportation funding is requested to increase by 1.5% or
$310 million above federal fiscal year 2025 funding levels.
State
On Monday, May 2, 2025, Governor Polis signed HB25-1290 – Transit Worker Assault and Funding.
Friday, June 6, 2025, marked the last day for Governor Polis to sign or veto legislation following the
conclusion of the 2025 legislative session.
In other state related matters, the Colorado Energy Office is beginning the process of establishing an
RTD Accountability Committee. No details are available yet, but staff will keep the Board updated on
developments that are shared from the Colorado Energy Office.
Local
At the local level, staff continues to actively arrange engagement opportunities with local municipal
partners. On May 4, 2025, the General Manager and CEO and Chief of Police and Emergency
Management presented on the topic of personal security at the Metro Mayors Caucus meeting that was
also attended by Director Guissinger. Staff will verbally outline additional local elected official
engagement taking place in June during the Executive Committee Meeting scheduled for Wednesday,
June 18, 2025.

Committee Meeting Date:
Honorary Property Name Proposal Review Committee
Recommendation – Civic Center Station

June 18, 2025

REPRESENTATIVE
Jack Kroll, Board Office Executive Manager
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
On July 30, 2024, the Board of Directors approved the Honorary Property and Station Naming Policy,
Procedures, and Review Rubric (the Policy). As a result, the Board Office created an application of
interest for community members to submit proposals to add an honorary name to an RTD station or
property. That application of interest launched on October 1, 2024 and can be found on the agency
website. Following the opening of the application, community members, who want the Board of
Directors to add an honorary name to Civic Center Station to recognize the contributions of Reverend
Wade Blank, submitted completed application packet on April 28, 2025.
To submit a completed application packet, community members must provide the following:
1. A narrative on the proposed honoree’s contributions to transit locally, nationally, and their
connection with the property for which the applicants are proposing an honorary name
2. Support letters from community members and local leaders for the proposed honorary name
3. A resolution or proclamation from the local city council or board of county commissioners
supporting the honorary name
The completed application packet in support of adding an honorary name to Civic Center Station to
recognize the life and career of Rev. Blank is attached to this board report. It should be noted that the
completed application packet includes 28 letters of support as well as a proclamation approved
unanimously by the Denver City Council supporting the proposal.
Subsequent to the receipt of the completed application packet, the Board Office convened an Honorary
Property Name Proposal Review Committee (Review Committee), which was charged with reviewing the
submitted application materials, meeting with the community members proposing the honorary name,
and making a recommendation to the Executive Committee on whether to pursue further the proposed
honorary name. As proscribed in the Policy, the Review Committee met three times: first to understand
the criteria and process established by the Board for consideration and potential adoption of an honorary
name, next to meet with the community members proposing the honorary name, and finally to make a
recommendation to the Executive Committee regarding the proposed honorary name.

Packet Pg. 34

The recommendation is based on Rev. Blank’s many contributions to transit locally, nationally, and his
direct connection to Civic Center Station.
Rev. Blank co-founded Atlantis Community, Incorporated (Atlantis), which is a Denver-based non-profit
organization in operation for over 50 years. Atlantis was established by Rev. Blank to assist people with
disabilities to live independently. One key element of being able to live independently is the ability to
access transit options. Rev. Blank’s work with Atlantis led to formal engagements with and peaceful
protests of RTD that resulted in the agency significantly increasing mobility options for disabled people.
Further Rev. Blank contributed significantly to transit nationally by leading engagements and peaceful
protests of transit agencies across the country as well as the American Public Transportation
Association (APTA) to advocate for greater mobility options for people with disabilities. This work is
widely regarded as having contributed significantly to the passing of the Americans with Disabilities Act
in 1990, which had the effect of greatly expanding transit resources for people with disabilities.
On July 5 and 6, 1978, Rev. Blank helped to lead a protest that later came to be known as the Gang of
19 Protest in which 19 disabled individuals surrounded two RTD buses on the corner of Colfax Avenue
and Broadway Boulevard—directly across Colfax Avenue from the where Civic Center Station sits today.
The protest was done to raise awareness around the lack of wheelchair lifts on RTD buses. As a result
of the protest, RTD agreed to purchase wheelchair lifts for a significant portion of the existing fleet of
buses. Additionally, this protest gathered significant local and national media attention and spawned
similar peaceful protests across the country in which individuals were able to draw attention to the lack
of public investment in transit options for disabled people. In 1995, RTD dedicated Civic Center Station
to Rev. Blank and commemorated that dedication with a plaque in his honor at the Station; in 2023
following a significant renovation to the Station, the agency held an event to commemorate the 1995
dedication.
While the final decision on any honorary name for Civic Center Station rests with the Board of Directors,
the Review Committee recommends that the name of the station be updated to Wade Blank Civic Center
Station. This name is what the community members who submitted the application requested, and
matches the proposed name contained in Denver City Council’s unanimously approved proclamation.

Packet Pg. 36

1.5.2

The Executive Committee is asked to discuss the merits of the application to honor Rev. Blank and
provide consensus direction to staff as to whether to bring forward a Recommended Action during the
July 2025 meeting cycle to effectuate an honorific name change for Civic Center Station.
Should the Executive Committee support the consideration of a Recommended Action, staff will prepare
cost estimates for updating the signage as well as a proposed timeline to make those changes—both of
which would be included as part of the subsequent Recommended Action report. Ultimately, the Board
must approve an honorary name by way of a two-thirds majority vote, which could occur as soon as the
Board’s July 29, 2025 meeting.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact to the Executive Committee holding this discussion. Should the Board move
forward with a name change for Civic Center Station the costs of updating signage will be included in
the subsequent Recommended Action.

This is a request to the Regional Transportation District (Colorado) to rename the
Civic Center Transit Station, located at Broadway and Colfax, to be renamed Civic Center
Station at Wade Blank Bus Terminal or (some other variation that includes his name)
Background: Two years ago Joe Beaver, a lifelong disability activist requested that the
renaming of Civic Center Station be in honor of Wade Blank.
Since that request, a working group of disability advocates has collected more than 40
letters of support for the effort. The letters of support include members of the disability
community, leaders of disability organizations, elected officials past and present, and
leaders in business and the general public.
The working group is requesting that RTD begin the process of appointing a working
committee, required by RTD renaming of property rules, no later April 1st, 2025 .
Below, is a section of a book “From Freak to Freedom” (A History of the Disability Rights
Movement) authored by Joe Beaver.
As you read, you will understand the impact the Reverend Wade Bland had on the civil
rights movement for both able and disabled individuals, access to transportation both
locally and nationally and the genesis of what we know today as independent living for
people with disabilities.
Sincerely,
Working Group: Jaime Lewis, Colorado Cross Disability Coalition, Joe Beaver, Disability
Activist, Brian Grewe, Executive Director Atlantis Community, Marrissa Carillo Atlantis,

Wade Blank
Wade Blank, a Presbyterian minister from Ohio, first found his passion for civil rights when
he marched with Martin Luther King, Jr., in Selma, Alabama. His church congregation in
Ohio insisted on more pompless protests. He was a minister at the University of Ohio when
National Guardsmen shot down four student protesters. Wade had needed a fresh start. So
he headed west to the Heritage House Nursing Home in Lakewood.
Rev. Wade Blank
The State of Colorado offered him a job where he could do some good. State institution
housing, where throw-away kids were often sent, were shutting down. Heritage House
nursing home saw a need to be filled and hired Wade Blank to be a Youth counselor and to
recruit new young residents. He was perfect for the job.- young, hip, long hair and all. But
ordained, steady, and level headed.
Or so they thought.
Wade recalled those Heritage smells upon arrival - urine and antiseptic. And then that first
meal. Baked potatoes, applesauce, and scrambled eggs. Cold. The old folks, with teeth
worn out from a lifetime of steak and corn on the cob, may have been grateful, or maybe
not. But the young people, for all their other maladies, had strong enough teeth. He could
make a difference here. He started by asking them a question they'd never been asked
before: What do you want?

After cranking up the rock 'n' roll radio and replacing the squishy food, and the 8:00 druginduced bedtime, he brought in a TV and tuned it to Laugh-In instead of Lawrence Welk.
The place rocked like a college dorm.

He got a van to haul them and their wheelchairs to discover new adeventures. They headed
to the mountains, wheeled around in the dirt, smelled the pine, felt the spray from
waterfalls, heard the crackle of campfire, and ate s'mores. They cheered at baseball
games. They hooted at professional wrestling matches and went out for ice cream.
The effort involved in getting them into concert venues would have challenged the biblical
Samson, but it was totally worth it. They rocked with the Grateful Dead at Denver Coliseum
and sang "Rocky Mountain High" along with John Denver at RedRocks. Some with gusto,
others croaked it out.
It wasn't enough. Nothing could ever be enough. No amount of ice cream and music could
fix a prison. The institution they were in was a prison for the innocent. How can you make a
nursing home acceptable? You just can't. What they needed was freedom. Wade suggested
to Heritage House that they provide services to some young residents at their own homes.
Of course, that would mean empty beds at the nursing home, so that idea was rejected
immediately.
Like the Presbyterian Church before them, Heritage House thought they'd hired a
progressive and got a radical instead - a crazy one!
But, when he took a group of residents to the Capitol to testify about the deplorable
conditions at Heritage House, he got fired...and fired up.
He moved eighteen severely disabled people to live independently and make their own
decisions at an apartment complex on 11th & Federal in Denver. Wade and Barry
Rosenberg helped them dress, toilet, and whatever they needed. Dr. Stuart Ferguson wrote
the prescriptions for them to live independently. Several Heritage House staff members
followed.
Mike Smith was one of the first residents to be set free from Heritage House. Upon his
release, he discovered that the nursing home owners had forged his signature on his
monthly $25 personal needs money from Medicaid. Mike's attorney, John Holland, filed suit
against Heritage House for illegally misappropriating and withholding"personal needs"
money of patients, inadequate care, and intimidating and threatening residents who seek
legal counsel. Funds from that lawsuit were used to purchase more housing and make
renovations. Apartment doors were widened, counters lowered, and attendants were hired
to help the individuals. Whatever assistance a person needed, they figured a way. They
pooled their Medicaid and SSI money and called themselves the Atlantis Community.
But the freedom was incomplete. None of the Atlantis residents could drive. A bus drove
past their apartments countless times a day, but there was no way to get a wheelchair on

board. RTD's Handi-Ride pretended to be an option. There were only twelve little buses for
five thousand subscribers. A typical call to Handi-Ride went like this:
Dialing . . .
Hello, Handi-Ride here.
I need a ride to the grocery store.
I'll put you down for a week from today.
I'm out of food!
'Shoulda thought of that sooner.
Dialing . . .
Hello, Handi-Ride here.
Can I get a ride to the Lakewood Grill?
That's a tavern. You shouldn't be drinking.
Dialing . . .
Hello, Handi-Ride.
Can I get a ride to church?
'Got an opening in two weeks at nine.
Service is every Sunday at eight o'clock.
There are TV evangelists for shut-ins, ya know.
So Atlantis went political. Americans Disabled for Accessible Public Transit, ADAPT, was
formed, and they wheeled over to the Regional Transportation District Board to talk and talk
and talk.
"The wheelchair ban on regularly scheduled buses is for your own good," RTD insisted,
"plus, you understand we can't inconvenience able-bodied riders."
ADAPT wrote letters to the City Council, the Legislature, and Congress, petitioned, made a
nuisance of themselves, and sued. The judge expressed concern for their safety.
Somebody might get hurt, he fretted.
Their concerns fell on deaf ears.

July 5, 1978, went something like this:
"Let's roll!" Wade lifted his arm and waved.
A man in his chair, hands on the wheels, pushed toward the bus stop.
"Kick some ass!" Wade said as the man rolled past to the edge of the curb. A bus pulled up.
The man waited.

The door swung open. "Waddaya want?" said the
driver.
"I want to ride."
"What are you? Crazy?"
Of course, this was crazy, but none of the gang would admit it.
"No, I just want to ride." Calm but firm.

The man wheeled himself right in front of the bus.
Thirty protesters witnessed it - eighteen in wheelchairs,
plus friends and family.
"Get out of here!" the driver yelled, flailing his arms, panic raising his voice. "What the hell
are you doing? There's another bus behind me, and you're blocking the way."
“exactly”.
Wade lifted his arm again, motioning toward the bus at the curb. Eighteen more
wheelchairs moved forward. Some people rolled in front of the bus. Others to each side. A
few in the back of the second bus. There, they stopped. Two buses surrounded,
immobilized.
"We will ride!" they shouted. "WE WILL RIDE!!"

Cars started stacking up down Colfax and Broadway. The intersection Traffic came to a
stand still. . Diesel fumes got thick. Passengers exited the trapped buses. Most looked
bewildered. Their faces revealed their thoughts: What in holy hell is going on?
Disabled people weren't supposed to go crazy, carry signs, and block buses. They're
supposed to stay indoors, have their food brought to them on a tray, watch soap operas or
something.
But what about freedom? Rosa Parks got famous by refusing to go to the back of the bus.
Disabled people couldn't even get on the bus.
Wade searched the bus passengers' faces for pity and saw little. Some looked red-faced
and angry. That was a victory, right there. Inconveniencing the able-bodied would take his
people where pity never could.
"Free our people!" the Gang of Nineteen shouted from all sides of the buses. "FREE OUR
PEOPLE!!"

Organizing this had been hard..
And yet, here we are, crushing it.
Police cruisers pulled up, lights flashing red
and blue. Ah, now it gets really interesting.
Officers meandered through the wheelchairs,
consulted with each other, and muttered into
their radios. Handcuffs swung from their
belts, but none reached for them.
Wade stood on the sidewalk.
The protesters started singing, "We shall overcome . . ." Eventually, an officer approached
the friends and family. One pointed at Wade. That was fine. He'd told them to.
The officer sauntered over. "What's going on?" he asked Wade. "They want accessible
buses."
"RTD has Handi-Ride. They can use that. Tell them."
"They want all buses accessible, so they can go where they want to go when they want to
go. All buses."
"They're blocking traffic."
"Yes, Officer. That's the point."

"The Rev. Wade Blank. I'm just here to hand out water and help them."
"Well, they gotta disperse, or we'll arrest them."
"First, sir, a person who's severely disabled has the same right as you to pursue his/her
happiness. And if that means getting arrested in front of a bus, so be it. Second, it's not
going to come to that, is it? You're not going to arrest them." "Hmph."
"Because your jail's not wheelchair accessible."
The overarching mission of the Atlantis Community was, and still is, to provide as many of
life's necessities—the necessities often taken for granted by those who do not live life with
a physical or mental disability—as possible. Blank and those who resided at Atlantis
decided to form an activist group to garner as much attention as possible for disability
rights – ADAPT (American Disabled for Attendant ProgramsToday, once known as the
American Disabled for Accessible Public Transit). The members of this militant-style
activist group first focused on the Regional Transportation District (RTD), the origin of the
initial rallies, which drew major attention to the cause. ADAPT members traveled
nationwide, protesting the American Public Transportation Association (APTA) and various
bus companies, like Greyhound, to get wheelchair lifts installed on buses. Many ADAPT
members were arrested during these protests, highlighting the lack of preparedness for
local police departments' inaccessible squad cars and facilities. Police officers erected
makeshift barriers to detain the ADAPT members in wheelchairs because they had no other
way of arresting and transporting the protestors. The second major wave of ADAPTprotests
targeted Social Security, health care policies, and Medicaid. Their ultimate goal was to
obtain government support for attendant care and independent living funds. Eventually,
ADAPT began protesting restaurants, schools, parking lots, post offices, housing
communities, casinos, churches, and more. Wherever wheelchairs could not go, ADAPT
was there to take action and demand access.
—------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Summary: As you can read, the journey for civil rights for people with disabilities was and
is still a journey. While civil rights actions for other deserving populations were going on,
Denver played a pivotal role in changing policies that affect people with disabilities
throughout the country.
Wade Blank’s leadership and work in the civil rights actions for people with disabilities
helped pave the way for better education opportunities like IDEA, set the foundation for the
implementation of the Americans with Disabilities Act and many other standards that we
take for granted today. However, his biggest accomplishment was empowering people with

RTD Board of Directors:
We, the undersigned legislators, are writing to express our support for renaming Civic Center Station in honor of
Reverend Wade Blank, a pioneering leader in Denver's disability rights movement. Renaming the station in honor of
Reverend Blank would not only celebrate his legacy, but also serve as a lasting symbol of the progress he helped
achieve by breaking down barriers for people with disabilities.
Reverend Blank's contributions to disability rights and accessibility were monumental. As an ordained minister, he
spearheaded the American Disabled for Accessible Public Transit (ADAPT) movement in 1975 to demand basic civil
rights for people with disabilities. Inspired by his participation in 1960s civil rights marches, Reverend Blank
courageously organized nonviolent protests like sit-ins to advance accessibility and independent living options.
When RTD refused to adequately address bus inaccessibility in the 1970s, Reverend Blank and a group known as
"The Gang of 19" led a two-day protest by surrounding buses at the Colorado State Capitol. This catalyzed RTD to
become the first transit agency in the nation to operate a fully accessible bus fleet, sparking change across the country.
Other cities have already renamed their transit stations in honor of pivotal civic rights leaders who have broken
barriers. Renaming a station after Reverend Blank in Denver would be a powerful affirmation of RTD's values of
diversity, inclusion, and expanding mobility for all. Additionally, highlighting his story aligns with RTD's mission of
serving all residents, regardless of ability.
The grassroots struggle for disability access led by Reverend Blank played a pivotal role in breaking down barriers
and transforming our community for the better. We urge you to support the proposal to rename Civic Center Station
in honor of Reverend Blank's legacy in expanding mobility and independence for people with disabilities.
Sincerely,

Letter of Support
Renaming Civic Center Bus Terminal
Dear Community Partner,
In early 2024 Joe Beaver, a longtime advocate for the disability community, requested that the
Regional Transportation District (RTD) rename Civic Center to Wade Blank.
Initial response was positive from the RTD Board, other elected oﬃcials and people familiar
with the impact Wade Blank has had on transportation and the independence of people with
disabilities, also provided positive support.
Though enthusiastic about the idea, the RTD Board of Directors realized that there was no
process documented that could help them with the legal and internal impacts of renaming its
properties. In 2024, the staﬀ at RTD and help with the Board of Directors developed and passed
a plan for renaming of RTD properties.
The ﬁrst set of applications, as you can guess, are to rename the Civic Center after Wade Blank.
One of the requirements needed to meet application requirements is to have local support for
the initiative. We are requesting that you support our eﬀorts. You can do this by simply
returning this email with your name as an endorser of your organization. You may also write a
letter of support with a description of how transportation supports your mission or helps
people that you advocate for becoming more independent.

Letter of Support
Renaming Civic Center Bus Terminal
Dear Community Partner,

In early 2024 Joe Beaver, a longtime advocate for the disability community, requested that the
Regional Transportation District (RTD) rename Civic Center to Wade Blank.
Initial response was positive from the RTD Board, other elected officials and people familiar
with the impact Wade Blank has had on transportation and the independence of people with
disabilities, also provided positive support.
Though enthusiastic about the idea, the RTD Board of Directors realized that there was no

process documented that could help them with the legal and internal impacts of renaming its
properties.

In 2024, the staff at RTD and help with the Board of Directors developed and passed

a plan for renaming of RTD properties.
The first set of applications, as you can guess, are to rename the Civic Center after Wade Blank.
One of the requirements needed to meet application requirements is to have local support for

the initiative. We are requesting that you support our efforts. You can do this by simply
returning this email with your name as an endorser of your organization. You may also write a
letter of support with a description of how transportation supports your mission or helps
people that you advocate for becoming more independent.

Letter of Support
Renaming Civic Center Bus Terminal
Dear Community Partner,

In early 2024 Joe Beaver, a longtime advocate for the disability community, requested that the
Regional Transportation District (RTD) rename Civic Center to Wade Blank.
Initial response was positive from the RTD Board, other elected officials and people familiar
with the impact Wade Blank has had on transportation and the independence of people with
disabilities, also provided positive support.
Though enthusiastic about the idea, the RTD Board of Directors realized that there was no

process documented that could help them with the legal and internal impacts of renaming its
properties.

In 2024, the staff at RTD and help with the Board of Directors developed and passed

a plan for renaming of RTD properties.
The first set of applications, as you can guess, are to rename the Civic Center after Wade Blank.
One of the requirements needed to meet application requirements is to have local support for

the initiative. We are requesting that you support our efforts. You can do this by simply
returning this email with your name as an endorser of your organization. You may also write a
letter of support with a description of how transportation supports your mission or helps

people that you advocate for becoming more independent.

HONORARY PROPERTY AND STATION NAMING REVIEW RUBRIC
ADOPTED: JULY 30, 2024
I.

PURPOSE

The rubric is designed to assist the Review Committee in its work to objectively and fairly evaluate proposals to
add an honorary name to an RTD property. An effective rubric should help the Review Committee be more
efficient and consistent in its review, while also signaling to potential applicants the committee’s expectations.
II.

CHANGES TO THE RUBRIC

The Board of Directors may change the rubric and encourages the Review Committee as well as public to provide
feedback on ways to improve the rubric on an on-going basis.
III. OVERVIEW
Evaluators are asked to review each application using the following rubric. Applications for honorary names
should be assessed relative to the application’s ability to convey the extent to which the proposed individual,
group or event has historical significance to RTD and/or transit, significant community support, and aligns with
RTD’s values. Each criterion is scored individually on a 1-7 scale, with the total points possible being 21.
Committee members scores will be aggregated and discussed before the committee invites those who submitted
top-scoring applications to meet with the committee to further discuss their proposals.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Authorizations for General Manager and CEO - Central Park
Development

June 10, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
June 24, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO or her designee to negotiate and
execute one or more option agreements, ground leases, and other documents related to the development
of the real property located at 3801 N. Ulster Street, Denver, Colorado (the Property), with Ulysses
Development Group.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Chessy Brady, Manager, Transit-Oriented Development
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
In 2010 and 2012, RTD purchased 19.6 acres for what is now Central Park Station on the A Line
corridor for $2,642,129 with federal grant funds. The property serves as the operating base for nine bus
routes and the park-and-ride (PnR) contains 1,521 spaces. The PnR is part of RTD’s parking
management system but is not maintained by RTD or Denver Transit Operators.
In November 2023, RTD issued a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) seeking a developer to develop
affordable housing on the PnR’s westernmost parcel, located at 3801 N. Ulster Street, on the southwest
corner of Smith Road and Ulster Street (as defined above, the Property) in Denver. The six-acre Property
has 651 transit parking spaces with very low parking utilization and very high development potential.
RTD selected Ulysses Development Group (UDG) as the potential developer of the Property based on
their ambitious affordable housing program, their access to financial resources, and their development
experience.
In June 2024, the Board authorized RTD to enter into an Exclusive Negotiation Agreement (ENA) with
UDG to address 1) negotiation and design schedule, 2) project financing, 3) development plan (density,
use, affordability), and 4) RTD maintenance and operations requirements. The June 2024 Board
authorization is attached to this report for reference. RTD and UDG executed the ENA in September
2024.
Pursuant to the ENA, UDG has committed to develop, in several phases, at least 500 apartment units, of
which no fewer than 250 will be affordable to households making up to 60% of area median income.
The development will also include public open space and other community benefits uses such as a
potential childcare center (collectively, the Project).

Packet Pg. 104

2.16.A

DISCUSSION
Adoption of this recommended action will enable the agency to move forward with the Project, creating
much-needed housing near transit, improving transit access, and generating revenue for RTD consistent
with the agency’s Equitable Transit-Oriented Development Policy and in furtherance of the agency’s
2021-2026 Strategic Plan priorities of Community Value, Customer Excellence, and Financial Success.
For the next phase of this Project, RTD will grant UDG an option or options (each, an Option) pursuant
to an Option Agreement to enter into one or more ground leases (each, a Ground Lease) for portions of
the Property in phases according to the terms set forth in the Option.
The exercise of an Option and the execution of a Ground Lease will only be authorized to take place if
the following conditions are met:
1. UDG and RTD have agreed on the overall scope of the applicable Project phase on the Property at
affordability levels consistent with eligibility requirements for Low Income Housing Tax Credits
(LIHTC) and/or other affordable housing financing, if applicable.
2. UDG has obtained all entitlements from the City and County of Denver necessary to construct the
applicable Project phase on the Property.
3. UDG has obtained LIHTC and/or other financing necessary to construct the applicable Project phase.
4. UDG and RTD have completed and agreed on an appraisal for the applicable Project phase, which
appraisal shall be used to determine fair market value and the ground lease payments under the
applicable Ground Lease in accordance with this Board approval and RTD policy.
5. UDG and RTD have agreed on a form of Ground Lease for the applicable Project phase.
If RTD and UDG are unable to negotiate one or more Ground Leases or any other necessary agreements,
RTD will retain all property rights and any subsequent decisions regarding the Property would be subject
to Board approval. Staff will keep the Board apprised of the development process.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The approval of the Option Agreement would provide RTD with potential future ground lease payments if
the Project is successful.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Kalamath Rail Reconstruction Project Contract Award

June 10, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
June 24, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO or her designee to enter into a
contract with RailWorks Partners LP (RailWorks) for the full-depth reconstruction of the Kalamath light
rail intersection in downtown Denver, in an amount not to exceed $3,585,990.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Jyotsna Vishwakarma, Acting Assistant General Manager, Capital Programs
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD’s Central Corridor (Corridor) is the oldest rail segment in the agency’s light rail system, having
opened for revenue service on Friday, October 7, 1994. The Corridor extends 5.3 miles from the I25·Broadway Station to the 30th·Downing Station. With the Corridor having been in continuous revenue
service for over 30 years, several paved track segments along the Corridor require full-depth
reconstruction, and associated rail infrastructure requires replacement as part of long-term operations
and maintenance of RTD’s assets to improve safety and mobility, address deteriorating transit
infrastructure, and extend the design life of the agency’s key transportation assets.
Maintenance of assets in a state of good repair by leveraging sound asset management principles
furthers RTD’s 2024-25 Strategic Initiative of Back to Basics. These principles involve identifying,
funding, and implementing projects to replace assets as they meet their expected useful life.
DISCUSSION
In adopting this recommended action, the agency seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan Priorities
of Community Value and Employee Ownership.
Under this contract, approximately 700 feet of double track of the Corridor west of north Speer
Boulevard and the crossing through Kalamath Street will be reconstructed. The Kalamath rail
reconstruction project, which is being completed in advance of the recommencement of the rail
reconstruction project in the Central Business District, includes custom fabricated curved rail segments
and special parts that have been procured separately.

Packet Pg. 121

2.16.B

The Kalamath rail reconstruction project is anticipated to commence September 2, 2025, and continue
through November 22, 2025, subject to city permitting, weather, and other factors that can impact
construction.
Solicitation Overview
On April 7, 2025, RTD advertised a solicitation for construction services related to the full-depth
reconstruction of the Kalamath crossing. Proposals were received May 16, 2025.
After evaluation of the proposals based upon the published evaluation criteria, the evaluation panel
unanimously recommended RailWorks for award.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for the contract, in an amount not to exceed $3,585,990, is included in the 2025 Budget.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Light Rail Operating Facilities and Security Command
Center Replacement HVAC Contract Award

June 10, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
June 24, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO or her designee to enter into a
contract with JCOR, Inc., for the replacement of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC)
equipment at the Elati and Mariposa light rail facilities and the Security Command Center with a total
not-to-exceed amount of $3,510,598.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Jyotsna Vishwakarma, Acting Assistant General Manager, Capital Programs
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
As part of the agency’s standard asset management renewal process, staff identified HVAC equipment
located at the Elati and Mariposa light rail facilities and the Security Command Center as having reached
the end of its useful service life, thus requiring replacement. This equipment includes a boiler, a chiller,
three make-up air units (to ensure proper ventilation and maintain building pressure balance), data center
cooling, and packaged heating/air conditioning units.
Replacement equipment will meet currently applicable mechanical and energy codes.
DISCUSSION
In adopting this recommended action, the agency seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan Priorities
of Community Value and Employee Ownership.
On February 7, 2025, RTD issued a solicitation for a contractor to complete the HVAC replacements
based on prepared plans and specifications. Bids were due on April 7, 2025, and two submittals were
received.
Should the Board approve this recommendation, the contractor will order equipment and mobilize for
construction when the equipment becomes available. The project is expected to be completed within 12
months following contract award.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The HVAC equipment replacements will be funded from existing capital improvement dollars allocated in
the 2025 Budget.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
2024 Annual Comprehensive Financial Report and Report
to Governance

June 12, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
June 24, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to accept into the records the Regional Transportation District’s Annual
Comprehensive Financial Report that includes audited financial reports relating to the year ended
December 31, 2024.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Kelly Mackey, Chief Financial Officer
Byron Aten, Senior Manager, Accounting
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
Colorado state statutes require an annual financial audit be performed on the financial statements of
governmental agencies by independent certified public accountants. RTD is required to provide these
annual audited financial statements to the State of Colorado, external entities, and other government
organizations to be in full compliance with legal covenants, debt agreements and other contractual
agreements. The audit firm Plante Moran, PLLC performed the financial audit of RTD’s financial
statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024.
In addition to the financial statement audit requirements set forth in state statutes, the audit also was
designed to fulfill the requirements of the federal Single Audit Act of 1984. A Single Audit is required
by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to review the expenditures of federal grant awards.
DISCUSSION
As stated in Plante Moran’s unmodified opinion, the financial statements in the enclosed Annual
Comprehensive Financial Report (ACFR) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
RTD as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flow for the
2024 and 2023 fiscal years in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact from this Recommended Action.

Chair Bouquet, members of the Board and service area residents,
State law requires that all general-purpose local governments publish within seven months of the
close of each fiscal year a complete set of financial statements presented in conformance with
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and audited in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards by a firm of licensed certified public accountants. Pursuant to that
requirement, the Annual Comprehensive Financial Report of the Regional Transportation District
(RTD) for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, is hereby issued.
This report consists of management’s representations concerning RTD’s finances. Consequently,
management assumes full responsibility for the completeness and reliability of all information
presented in this report. To provide a reasonable basis for making these representations,
management has established a comprehensive internal control framework that is designed both
to protect the agency’s assets from loss, theft, or misuse and to compile sufficient, reliable
information for the preparation of RTD’s financial statements in conformity with GAAP. The cost
of internal controls should not outweigh the benefits, and RTD’s comprehensive framework of
internal controls has been designed to provide reasonable rather than absolute assurance that the
financial statements will be free from material misstatement. As the agency’s General Manager
and CEO (GM/CEO), I assert that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, this financial report is
complete and reliable in all material respects.
RTD’s financial statements have been audited by Plante Moran, PLLC, a firm of licensed certified
public accountants. The goal of the independent audit was to provide reasonable assurance that
RTD’s financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, are free of material
misstatement. The independent audit involved examining on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements; assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management; and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. The independent auditor concluded, based upon the audit, that there was a
reasonable basis for rendering an unmodified opinion that RTD’s financial statements for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2024, are fairly presented in conformity with GAAP. The independent
auditor’s report is presented as the first component of this report in the Financial Section.
The independent audit of RTD’s financial statements was part of a broader, federally mandated
“Single Audit” designed to meet the requirements of federal grantor agencies. The standards
governing Single Audit engagements require the independent auditor to report not only on the fair
presentation of the financial statements, but also on the audited government’s internal controls
and compliance with legal requirements, with special emphasis on internal controls and legal
requirements involving the administration of federal awards. These reports are in RTD’s separately
issued Single Audit Report.
GAAP requires that management provide a narrative introduction, overview, and analysis to
accompany the basic financial statements in the form of Management’s Discussion and Analysis
(MD&A). This letter of transmittal is designed to complement the MD&A and should be read in

RTD provides public transportation services to the Denver metropolitan area. In 1969, the
Colorado General Assembly (Assembly) found that public transit was a necessary part of the
growing Denver metropolitan region. The Assembly found that public sector involvement was the
best method to ensure the continuation of this vital service. Thus, RTD was created as a political
subdivision of the State effective July 1969 “to develop, maintain, and operate a public mass
transportation system for the benefit of the District.”
RTD boundaries include Jefferson, Boulder, and Denver counties, most of the City and County of
Broomfield, and portions of Adams, Douglas, Weld, and Arapahoe counties. Over 3.1 million
people reside within RTD’s 2,345 square mile service area.
Since 1983, RTD has had a 15-member Board of Directors that is elected directly by a constituency
to serve four-year staggered terms to govern RTD. There are approximately 207,000 residents
per director district. The RTD Board of Directors is responsible for setting policy, overseeing the
agency’s annual budget, and establishing short and long-range transit goals and plans in concert
with local, state, and federal agencies.
In 2024, RTD employed 3,060 people, making it one of the largest employers in the eight-county
area. In addition, RTD contracts with private carriers to provide paratransit service branded
“Access-a-Ride” and “Access-on-Demand”, fixed route bus and commuter rail services employing
1,599 individuals. Besides its administrative headquarters in Denver, RTD has seven operating
facilities (excluding purchased transportation services), including four in Denver, one in Aurora,
one in Englewood, and one in Boulder.
The financial reporting entity includes all the financial activities of RTD, as well as those activities
of its component unit, the Asset Acquisition Authority, Inc. (the Authority), a nonprofit corporation
established to facilitate RTD’s use of lease/purchase financing. In addition, the financial reporting
entity also includes activities of the RTD Salaried Pension Plan and RTD Salaried Employee 401(a)
Plan for which there is a fiduciary relationship.
RTD maintains budgetary controls that ensure compliance with legal provisions embodied in the
annual appropriated budget approved by its Board of Directors. The budget represents the
agency’s financial plan for the forthcoming year, including the expenditure appropriation for
operations, planning, administration, development, debt service, and capital assets. The level of
budgetary control (i.e. the level at which expenditures cannot legally exceed the appropriated
amount) is established at the project level.
The annual budget serves as the foundation for RTD’s financial planning and control. All
departments are required to submit requests for appropriation to the GM/CEO on or before August
of each year. The GM/CEO uses these requests as the starting point for developing a proposed
budget. The GM/CEO then presents this proposed budget to the Board of Directors for review
prior to October 15. The Board of Directors is required to hold a public hearing on the proposed
budget and to adopt a final budget no later than December 31.

Factors Affecting Financial Condition
The information presented in the financial statements is perhaps best understood when it is
considered in the broader perspective of the specific environment within which RTD operates.

Service Area
RTD serves the Denver metro area, operating in all or part of eight counties and more than 40
municipalities. It is the most populated area of the state and the economic barometer of
Colorado. Employment in the Denver metro area is dominated by small businesses that represent
a diverse mix of industries and geographic distribution of employment centers.

Economic Considerations
The Colorado Legislative Council (CLC) in its March 2025 report forecast a continued expansion
of national and Colorado economies. However, a weakening job market and continuing inflation,
coupled with a rapidly changing federal policy and heightened ongoing risks led to downward
revisions of the forecast for both the state and the U.S in 2025 and 2026. The CLC emphasized
the uncertainty currently being experienced at both the local and national levels.
Economists for CLC reported the following key economic indicators for Colorado and the Denver metro
area:


State of Colorado unemployment in 2023 and 2024 was 3.3% and 4.3%, respectively. Forecasted
unemployment for the state in 2025 and 2026 is expected to be 4.7% and 4.6%.
Personal Income growth in Colorado in 2023 and 2024 was 5.1% and 4.8%, respectively.
Forecasted personal income growth for the state in 2025 and 2026 is 4.2% and 4.3%.
The percent change in retail trade sales in Colorado was 1.1% and -.3% in 2023 and 2024,
respectively. Anticipated changes in 2025 and 2026 for the state are 1.0% and 1.1%.
Population growth in Colorado was .9% in 2023 and 1.0% in 2024. Forecasted growth for 2025
and 2026 is 1.0% and 1.1% for the state.
Inflation in the Denver metro area was 5.2% in 2023 and 2.4% in 2024.
Employment growth in the Denver metro area was 2.2% in 2023 and .1% in 2024.
Retail sales growth in the Denver metro area was a -.1% decrease in 2023 and 1.7% in 2024.
The Unemployment rate for the Denver metro area was 3.1% in 2023 and 4.1% in 2024.

Unused appropriations lapse at year-end, except that the Board of Directors has the authority, as
stated in the adopted appropriation resolution, to carry-over the unused portion of the funds for
capital projects not completed, for a period not to exceed three years.

In 1992, voters approved an amendment to the Colorado Constitution known as the Taxpayer’s
Bill of Rights (TABOR), that limits revenue, and spending for state and local governments and
requires voter approval of measures to increase debt, spending or taxes. In 1995, the voters of

8

Packet Pg. 146

2.16.D.b

the District exempted RTD from TABOR’s revenue and spending limitations through December 31,
2005. In 1999, the voters of the District authorized RTD to increase its debt to exclusively finance
the Southeast Corridor light rail project and further exempted RTD from TABOR’s revenue and
spending limitations until such time as that debt is repaid, but not later than December 31, 2026.
The bonds issued pursuant to this authority were repaid in November 2024.
In 2004, voters authorized a 0.4% increase in RTD’s sales tax (for a total 1% tax) and an increase
in debt with all proceeds of such debt and taxes to be used to fund the transportation expansion
plan known as FasTracks. This authorization also exempted the District from any revenue and
spending limitations under TABOR on the additional tax and on investment income generated by
the increased tax revenue. It is currently anticipated that the FasTracks debt will be repaid as
early as 2050, at such time, the sales and use tax rate will be reduced to a rate necessary to
operate the transit system but not less than 0.6%. On November 5, 2024, the voters of the
District exempted RTD from TABOR revenue growth limitations in perpetuity.
Long-term Financial Planning
Each year the Board of Directors adopts a financially balanced Five-year Financial Forecast (FYFF),
which is the five-year operating and capital improvement forecasting plan for RTD including both
the Base System and FasTracks. The FYFF is a component of the long-term transportation
planning program for the Denver metropolitan area evaluated by the Denver Regional Council of
Governments (DRCOG), the Metropolitan Planning Organization. While the FYFF is developed
separately for the Base System and FasTracks, RTD integrates both plans into a single medium
and long-range Financial Plan in a single report. This financial information forms the basis for
the development of RTD’s annual budget. In September 2024, the Board of Directors approved
the 2025-2029 FYFF.
Long-term financial planning seeks to allocate resources among related and, at times, competing
initiatives and activities, and to optimize those resources in a manner consistent with RTD’s 20212026 Strategic Plan.
FINANCIAL INFORMATION
RTD management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an internal control structure
designed to ensure that assets are protected from loss, theft, or misuse and that adequate
accounting data are compiled to allow for the preparation of financial statements in conformity
with GAAP. RTD has designed its internal control structure to provide reasonable, but not
absolute, assurance that these objectives are met. The concept of reasonable assurance
recognizes that: (1) the costs of a control should not exceed the benefits likely to be derived and
(2) the valuation of costs and benefits requires estimates and judgment by management.
Single Audit: As a recipient of federal assistance, RTD is responsible for ensuring that an
adequate internal control structure is instituted to ensure compliance with applicable laws and
regulations related to those programs. This internal control structure is subject to periodic
evaluation by management.

As part of RTD’s single audit, tests are made to determine the adequacy of the internal control
structure, including that portion related to federal financial assistance programs, as well as to
evaluate RTD’s compliance. RTD’s single audit for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024 found
no instances of material weakness in the internal control structures or significant violations of
applicable laws and regulations. A separate report was prepared for this purpose.
Fiscal Policy: RTD follows a fiscal policy approved by the Board of Directors annually or as
necessary due to modification. The fiscal policy contains policies for revenue, investments,
expenditures, capital improvements, fund balance, debt, budgeting, accounting and grants.
Debt Administration: RTD formulates its debt policy to protect its credit ratings and soundly
manage its assets and liabilities. Included in this policy is a requirement that debt will not be
used to finance current operations. Another requirement precludes financing capital projects
beyond the useful life of the project. Additional policies go beyond these essential guidelines and
result in further protection. RTD has separate ratings for its Base System and FasTracks sales
and use taxes. Base System bonds secured by the 0.6% sales tax are rated by Moody’s Investors
Service as “Aa1”, by Standard and Poor’s Corporation as “AAA” and by Fitch Ratings as “AA”.
FasTracks Bonds that are secured by a first lien on the District’s 0.4% sales tax and a subordinate
lien on the 0.6% sales tax are rated by Moody’s Investors Service as “Aa2”, by Standard and
Poor’s Corporation as “AAA” and by Fitch Ratings as “AA”.
Cash Management: The main objective of RTD’s cash management program is the protection
of investment principal while providing optimal levels of cash throughout the year. The RTD
investment policy is modified periodically to adapt to changes in eligible investments, benchmarks,
and specific objectives.
During the year, RTD invested its cash in various investment vehicles including money market funds,
U.S. Treasury securities, agency securities, discount notes, commercial paper, repurchase
agreements, and variable and fixed rate mortgage-backed securities. The total average return on
cash and liquidity tier investments for the year was 5.1%.
Risk Management: RTD employs a combination of self-insurance and purchased insurance in
its efforts to protect assets and control and prevent losses.
The areas of self-insurance are worker’s compensation, automobile, general liability, and felonious
assault. RTD is self-insured for liability, the limits of which are $424,000 per person and
$1,195,000 per occurrence as specified under the Colorado Governmental Immunity Act for claims
arising on or after January 1, 2022. The self-insured retention for worker’s compensation claims
is $2,000,000 per claim, with any amounts above this covered by purchased insurance up to the
legal limits of liability under the Colorado worker’s compensation statute.
Commercial insurance policies provide coverage including: property coverage up to $500,000,000
for buildings, their contents, and rolling stock (other than collision); a commuter rail railroad
liability policy of $323,000,000 to cover the cap on damages set by federal law; a Commercial
Crime Policy with a limit of $10,000,000; a Cyber policy with $15,000,000 in limits; an Excess
Workers’ Compensation policy with a $2,000,000 retention and statutory limits, a $5,000 bond
for Commercial Driver’s License Testing Performance Bond; $4,000,000 Workers’ Compensation

policy covering Employment Practices and Law Enforcement Services liability with $10,000,000 in
limits as well as a policy with coverage for $23,703,600 per occurrence for Light Rail Vehicle-only
damage resulting from a derailment.
OTHER INFORMATION
Awards: The Government Finance Officers Associations (GFOA) awarded a Certificate of

Regional Transportation District
Denver, Colorado
Report on the Audits of the Financial Statements
Opinions
We have audited the financial statements of the enterprise fund and aggregate remaining fund information of the
Regional Transportation District (the "District") as of and for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 and
the related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise the District's basic financial statements,
as listed in the table of contents.
In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
respective financial position of the enterprise fund and aggregate remaining fund information of the Regional
Transportation District as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 and the respective changes in its financial position and,
where applicable, its cash flows thereof for the years then ended in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.
Basis for Opinions
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America (GAAS) and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards,
issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. Our responsibilities under those standards are further
described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audits of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are
required to be independent of the District and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the
relevant ethical requirements relating to our audits. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. The financial statements of the Salaried
Pension Plan were not audited under Government Auditing Standards.
Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and for the design, implementation, and
maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, management is required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events,
considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the District's ability to continue as a going concern
for 12 months beyond the financial statement date, including any currently known information that may raise
substantial doubt shortly thereafter.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audits of the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our
opinions. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and, therefore, is not a
guarantee that audits conducted in accordance with GAAS and Government Auditing Standards will always detect
a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is
higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a
substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a
reasonable user based on the financial statements.

To the Board of Directors
Regional Transportation District
Denver, Colorado
In performing audits in accordance with GAAS and Government Auditing Standards, we:

• Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audits.
error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining,
on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.

• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audits in order to design audit procedures that are

appropriate in the circumstances but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
District's internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.

• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting
estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the financial statements.

• Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise
substantial doubt about the District's ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.

We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the
planned scope and timing of the audits, significant audit findings, and certain internal control-related matters that
we identified during the audits.
Required Supplementary Information
Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that the management's
discussion and analysis and required supplementary information, as identified in the table of contents, be
presented to supplement the basic financial statements. Such information is the responsibility of management
and, although not a part of the basic financial statements, is required by the Governmental Accounting Standards
Board, which considers it to be an essential part of financial reporting for placing the basic financial statements in
an appropriate operational, economic, or historical context. We have applied certain limited procedures to the
required supplementary information in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States
of America, which consisted of inquiries of management about the methods of preparing the information and
comparing the information for consistency with management's responses to our inquiries, the basic financial
statements, and other knowledge we obtained during our audits of the basic financial statements. We do not
express an opinion or provide any assurance on the information because the limited procedures do not provide us
with sufficient evidence to express an opinion or provide any assurance.
Supplementary Information
Our audits were conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the financial statements that collectively
comprise Regional Transportation District's basic financial statements. The supplementary information, as
identified in the table of contents, is presented for the purpose of additional analysis and is not a required part of
the basic financial statements. Such information is the responsibility of management and was derived from and
relates directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements. The
information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audits of the basic financial statements
and certain additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying
accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements or to the basic financial statements
themselves, and other additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the
United States of America. In our opinion, the supplementary information is fairly stated in all material respects in
relation to the basic financial statements as a whole.
Other Information
Management is responsible for the other information included in the Annual Comprehensive Financial Report. The
other information comprises the introductory and statistical sections but does not include the basic financial
statements and our auditor's report thereon. Our opinions on the basic financial statements do not cover the other
information, and we do not express an opinion or any form of assurance thereon.

In connection with our audit of the basic financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and
consider whether a material inconsistency exists between the other information and the basic financial statements
or whether the other information otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work performed,
we conclude that an uncorrected material misstatement of the other information exists, we are required to
describe it in our report.
Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards
In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report dated May 27, 2025 on our
consideration of the Regional Transportation District's internal control over financial reporting and on our tests of
its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, grant agreements, and other matters. The
purpose of that report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting and
compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the Regional
Transportation District's internal control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of
an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the Regional Transportation
District's internal control over financial reporting and compliance.

The management of the Regional Transportation District (RTD) offers users of its financial statements this
narrative overview and analysis of the financial activities for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.
This discussion and analysis is designed to assist and focus the reader on significant financial activities and
identify any significant changes in RTD’s financial position. It should be read in conjunction with the financial
statements that follow this section. All amounts, unless otherwise indicated, are expressed in thousands of
dollars.
Financial Highlights
RTD has undertaken several initiatives such as implementation of a System Optimization Plan, which is a
product of the Comprehensive Operational Analysis, and the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan. Strategic priorities
encapsulated within the Strategic Plan include RTD providing Community Value, Customer Excellence,
Employee Ownership and Financial Success by focusing on (1) Back to Basics, (2) People Power, (3)
Providing a Welcoming Transit Environment and (4) Customer and Community Connections
as RTD continues to migrate from completion of the large FasTracks expansionary projects to redirecting
additional efforts to operations and maintenance and maintaining assets in a state of good repair.
Inflation and supply chain issues continue to be challenging for RTD and mitigation efforts through
contractual arrangements have avoided any material disruptions while also supporting budget certainty.
Public transit services are highly dependent on people power and significant efforts have been implemented
to shore-up chronic front line staffing shortfalls which have been endemic throughout the industry. Focusing
on people power has resulted in steady improvements in reducing vacancies while mitigating service
disruptions. RTD has also implemented significant improvements to enhance personal security for
employees and customers which has proven challenging in the past due to societal issues. RTD has
expanded its transit police force and outreach efforts while reducing reliance on contracted security services.
Several debt refinancings for interest savings over recent years has reduced debt service requirements. In
addition, a new fare structure and lower fares were implemented, including zero fares for youth 19 and
under in 2024 as a result of a fare study and equity analysis focusing on simplicity, affordability and equity.
Maintaining assets in a state of good repair resulted in completion of significant light rail reconstruction and
maintenance projects that will continue in future years. Significant progress was achieved in addressing
societal security issues including expansion of the police force, mental health and unhoused outreach efforts
as well as technological and transit environment enhancements. Each of these items have resulted in
significant improvements while also reducing financial risk and improving RTD’s financial results and
position.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, total assets and deferred outflows of resources of RTD exceeded total
liabilities and deferred inflows of resources by $3,286,082 and $3,568,123 (after restatement for GASB 101
implementation) respectively. The amount of unrestricted net position as of December 31, 2024, was
$462,820 compared to $557,598 in 2023 (after GASB 101 restatement). RTD’s 2024 unrestricted net
position was negatively impacted by flat Sales and Use tax collections and reduced operating grant
assistance.
The net position of RTD decreased by $282,041 (7.9%) during the current year compared to an increase
of $19,105 (.5%) (after restatement) in the previous year. The decrease in 2024 resulted from the
previously mentioned influences while 2023 was positively impacted by expenditures aligned with the
Strategic plan, reduced debt service and improved investment returns.

RTD is heavily reliant on sales and use tax collections. Collections in 2024 were flat compared to 2023;
however, improvements in investment returns and favorable cost variances to budgeted appropriations
resulted in maintenance of fund balances. Transit boarding decreases during COVID-19, shifting travel
patterns and implementation of reduced fares and zero fares for youth have resulted in fares only
contributing 5.9% of total revenues. This has not contributed to unexpected financial constraints and
requires no significant financial adjustments since fares have historically comprised a relatively small
percentage of revenue.
RTD’s sales and use tax revenues are its largest single source of revenues. These tax revenues were flat in
2024 compared to 2023 which resulted from economic and inflationary pressures on consumers. RTD
received voter approval in November 2024 to continuer exemption in perpetuity from the Taxpayer’s Bill of
Rights (TABOR) revenue growth limitations beginning in 2025.
For 2024, total operating expenses exceeded total revenues resulting in a loss before non-operating revenue
and expenses of $1,167,133 compared to a loss of $1,052,653 for 2023. The increase in operating loss for
2024 was primarily due to increased operating expenses from restored services, contractual wage increases,
increased contracted services and purchased transportation costs as well as unusually high inflation. RTD
anticipates operating losses each year, as these losses are subsidized by non-operating sales and use tax,
grant revenues and other miscellaneous income.
RTD’s total debt decreased $66,376 (2.3%) and decreased $125,292 (4.2%) in 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Outstanding debt decreased in 2024 and 2023 due to payment of outstanding principal balances through
scheduled debt service and refinancing of certain outstanding obligations for interest savings and reduction
of outstanding principal.
Capital grants and local contributions decreased $25,287 (47.1%) in 2024 after increasing $38,035
(241.1%) in 2023. The decrease in 2024 in capital grant expenditures is a result of RTD winding down its
large capital projects and transitioning from a focus on building out assets to a concentration on operations
and maintenance.
Grant operating assistance decreased $181,537 (77.4%) in 2024 versus a decrease of $72,554 (23.6%) in
2023. The large decrease in 2024 was due to pending federal preventive maintenance funding for fiscal
year 2024 that is expected to be received in 2025.
RTD’s capital assets, net of depreciation, decreased $270,859 (4.7%) in 2024 and decreased $238,499
(4.0%) in 2023 primarily due to depreciation.
Basic Financial Statements
Management’s Discussion and Analysis serves as an introduction to RTD’s basic financial statements. RTD’s
financial statements are prepared using proprietary fund (enterprise fund) accounting that uses a similar
basis of accounting as private-sector business enterprises. Under this method of accounting, an economic
resources measurement focus, and an accrual basis of accounting are used. Revenue is recorded when
earned and expenses are recorded when incurred.

The basic financial statements are comprised of four components: statements of net position; statements
of revenues, expenses and changes in net position; statements of cash flows; and notes to the financial
statements.

24
Packet Pg. 162

The statements of net position present information on assets and deferred outflows of resources and
liabilities and deferred inflows of resources, with the difference between the two reported as the net
position. Over time, increases or decreases in net position may serve as a useful indicator of whether the
financial position of RTD is improving or deteriorating. The statements of revenues, expenses, and changes
in net position present information on operating revenues and expenses and non-operating revenues and
expenses of RTD for the fiscal year with the difference, the net income or loss, combined with any capital
grants and local contributions to determine the change in net position for the year. That change combined
with the previous year-end total net position reconciles to the net position total at the end of the current
fiscal year. All changes in net position are reported as soon as the underlying event giving rise to the
changes occurs, regardless of the timing of the related cash flows.
The statements of cash flows report cash and cash equivalent activities for the fiscal year resulting from
operating activities, capital, and related financing activities, noncapital and related financing activities and
investing activities. The result of these activities added to the beginning of the year cash balance reconciles
to the cash and cash equivalents balance at the end of the current fiscal year. The statements of cash
flows, along with the related notes and information in other financial statements, can be used to assess the
following: RTD’s ability to generate positive cash flows and pay its debt as the debt matures; the reasons
for differences between RTD’s operating cash flows and operating income (loss); and the effect of investing,
capital, and financing activities on RTD’s financial position.
The notes to the financial statements provide additional information that is essential to fully understand the
data provided in the statements of net position, statements of revenues, expenses, and changes in net
position, and statements of cash flows.
RTD provides bus, paratransit, micro-transit, light rail and commuter rail service in a 2,345 square mile area
(District) in and around metropolitan Denver, Colorado. The activities of RTD are supported by a 0.6% and
a 0.4% sales and use tax collected within the District. The 0.6% sales and use tax is used to fund the Base
System operations of RTD. The Base System operations provide the bus and most current light rail services
in the Denver area. The 0.4% sales and use tax was used to fund the FasTracks build-out program and
provide funding for operation and maintenance of those program elements as well as providing for enhanced
transit services in the District. Additional revenue sources include fare collections, federal, state, and local
financial assistance, investment income, and other income such as advertising and rental income.

*GASB 101 was implemented in the current year which resulted in an adjustment to beginning net position
as described in Note A.

In 2024, current assets decreased by $138,077 (15.0%) primarily due to flat Sales and Use Tax collections
and delays in receiving federal grant funding.
In 2024, capital assets net of accumulated depreciation decreased $270,860 (4.7%) primarily due to the
depreciation of assets.
Total liabilities and deferred inflows decreased $81,273 (2.1%) in 2024 primarily due to reduction of debt
through refinancings for interest savings.

Statements of Net Position – The following summary of net position shows RTD’s financial position and
obligations as of December 31 for each of the last three fiscal years.

The net position of RTD decreased by $282,041 (7.9%) during 2024 compared to an increase of $19,105
(.5%) in the previous year (after GASB 101 restatement). The decrease in 2024 was due to sales tax
revenues stagnation and a reduction in collections from federal grant operating assistance due to pending
fiscal year 2024 funding.

Passenger fares – Passenger fares provided 5.9% of total revenues in 2024 and 4.9% in 2023,
respectively. Farebox receipts, monthly and annual pass revenue, and special event fares for bus and rail
services are included in passenger fares. Passenger fares increased by $372 (.6%) in 2024 compared to a
decrease of $11,758 (15.6%) in 2023. The large decrease in 2023 is attributed to two months of the Zero
Fare for Better Air program with no fare for two months in 2023. There was no similar program in 2024
and the lack of a corresponding increase in fare revenue is a result of reduced ridership on light rail lines
caused by the introduction of a light rail reconstruction effort as well as implementation of reduced fares in
2024.
Advertising and other – Advertising and other revenue provided 0.1% and 0.1% of total revenues in
2024 and 2023. Advertising and other income was relatively flat in 2024 compared to 2023, with a $13
increase, a .9% increase over 2023. This following a 43.9% decrease in 2023 over the prior year, primarily
due to the implementation of GASB 87.
Sales and Use Tax – Sales and use tax provided 79.3% and 66.6% of RTD’s total revenues in 2024 and
2023, respectively. Sales and use tax is a dedicated combined 1.0% tax imposed on certain sales within the
District. Sales and use tax decreased $722 (0.1%) in 2024 compared to an increase of $2,987 (0.3%) in
2023 compared to 2022. The significant slowdown in spending in the Denver metro area that began in 2023
continued into 2024, leading to the decline in Sales and Use Tax revenue. Due to the reduction in grant
operating assistance, although total sales and use tax revenues declined a minimal amount, the percent of
total revenue increased to 79.4% in 2024 compared to 66.6% of total revenue in 2023.
Grant operating assistance – Grant operating assistance provided 4.9% and 18.2% of total revenues in
2024 and 2023. Grant operating assistance decreased $181,537 (77.4%) in 2024 compared to a decrease
of $72,554 (23.6%) in 2023. The decrease in 2024 is due to pending fiscal year 2024 preventive
maintenance funding while 2023’s decrease is due to the ending of federal COVID emergency assistance at
the end of 2022.

Packet Pg. 167

Investment Income – Investment income provided 5.3% and 4.5% of total revenues in 2024 and 2023.
Investment income decreased $401 (.7%) in 2024 compared to an increase of $59,115 (5,890.3%) in 2023.
The relatively small decrease seen in 2024 compared to 2023 was a result of a stable investment
environment year over year versus the higher fixed income yields experienced in 2023 over the prior year.
Other Income/Gain on sale of assets – Other income provided 1.8% and 1.5% of total revenues in
2024 and 2023. Other income includes interest subsidy income, rental income from retail space, parking,
and miscellaneous other items. Other income increased $685 (3.6%) in 2024 compared to a decrease of
$15,380 (44.7%) in 2023. The increase in 2024 was due to a small gain recognized from the sale of assets
compared to a loss in the past year. The decrease in 2023 was primarily due to the receipt of a returned
credit risk premium associated with a prior year federal loan in 2022 and the one-time occurrence of this
receipt.
Capital grants and local contributions – Capital grants and local contributions provided 2.6% and 4.2%
of total revenues in 2024 and 2023. Capital grants and local contributions decreased $25,287 (47.1%) in
2024 and increased $38,035 (243.1%) in 2023. The decrease in 2024 is due to the winding down of the
FasTracks expansion with most of the project reconciliation and finalization being completed in 2023 leading
to the large increase in revenue experienced during that year.

Salaries and wages – Other than depreciation, salary and wage expense is the largest expense category
accounting for 20.6% and 19.7% of the total RTD expenses in 2024 and 2023 (restated), respectively.
Salary and wage expenses increased by $30,987 (14.4%) in 2024 compared to an increase of $10,912
(4.6%) in 2023. The increase in both years was primarily due to contracted wage increase, inflationary
adjustments, and increased full time equivalents as the agency continues to fill open positions and expansion
of the police force. The amount of increase in 2023 is after restatement for GASB 101.

Benefits – Fringe benefits accounted for 8.9% of total expenses in both 2024 and 2023. Fringe benefits
increased by $8,285 (7.3%) in 2024 compared to an increase of $8,641 (8.2%) in 2023. Increases are
primarily tied to wages through payroll taxes in addition to inflationary increases for benefits such as health
and welfare.
Materials and supplies – The materials and supplies expense category accounted for 4.5% of the total
expenses in 2024 and 4.2% in 2023. Materials and supplies expenses increased $7,478 (14.0%) in 2024
compared to an increase of $9,709 (22.2%) in 2023. The increase in both years primarily resulted from
higher-than-normal inflation and supply-chain constraints.
Services – Services expense accounted for 10.7% of total expenses in 2024 and 7.7% in 2023. Services
expense includes contracted services such as security services, vehicle, equipment and right of way
maintenance services, advertising and marketing services, and legal services. Services expense increased
$48,185 (49.5%) in 2024 compared to an increase of $14,707 (17.8%) in 2023. A big portion of the
increase in 2024 is due to RTD acting as the direct grant recipient for the East Colfax Bus Rapid Transit
(BRT) project with City and County of Denver as the subrecipient, which will be reimbursed by FTA funding
in addition to expansion of RTD’s Access on Demand services.
Utilities – Utilities accounted for 1.3% and 1.5% of total expenses in 2024 and 2023, respectively. Utilities
expense includes electric, telecommunications, water and sewer, and natural gas for facilities as well as
traction power for rail lines. Utilities expense decreased $1,472 (7.5%) in 2024 compared to an increase
of $1,109 (6.0%) in 2023. The decrease in 2024 is attributed to a reduction of traction power costs on the
light rail lines resulting from reduced activity due to track replacement and maintenance.
Insurance – Insurance accounted for 1.1% of total expenses in both 2024 and 2023. Insurance expense
includes RTD’s self-insured cost for general liability and worker’s compensation claims as well as the
premium cost for excess insurance lines, cybersecurity and railroad liability insurance. Insurance expense
increased $499 (3.5%) in 2024 and increased $928 (7%) in 2023. As with 2023, the increase in 2024
resulted primarily from increased premium rates.
Purchased transportation – The purchased transportation expense category accounted for 18.9% and
17.6% of the total expenses in 2024 and 2023. Purchased transportation represents the costs of contracted
transportation services for Bus, Commuter Rail, Access-a-Ride (paratransit), and FlexRide (micro-transit)
services. Purchased transportation costs increased $34,053 (15.2%) in 2024 and increased $27,333
(13.9%) in 2023. The increase in 2024 was driven by new contracts under Access a Ride and Flex Ride
programs as well as increases under the Commuter Rail Concessionaire agreement. The increase in 2023
was due to the expiration of certain large, fixed route contracts with inflationary increases included in the
new contracts.
Leases and rentals – Leases and rentals include lease expense for office space, office equipment, Parkn-Ride facilities, and use of communication towers and accounted for 0.2% of total expenses in both 2024
and 2023. Leases and rentals expense increased $437 (17.5%) in 2024 compared to an increase of $952
(61.8%) in 2023. This category of expense is relatively immaterial and tends to fluctuate with vacancy
changes.

Packet Pg. 170

2.16.D.b

Depreciation – The depreciation expense category accounted for 23.9% and 26.8% of the total expenses
in 2024 and 2023, respectively. RTD’s depreciation expense is a straight-line non-cash systematic allocation
of the cost of capital assets over the estimated useful life of the assets. Depreciation expense decreased
$14,912 (4.4%) in 2024 compared to a decrease of $18,337 (5.1%) in 2023. The decrease in 2024 primarily
resulted from the retirement of a large amount of revenue vehicles. while the decrease in 2023 was due to
certain assets reaching full depreciation.
Interest expense – The interest expense category accounted for 9.6% and 10.6% of the total expenses
in 2024 and 2023, respectively. Interest expense decreased $3,559 (2.6%) in 2024 and decreased $3,728
(2.7%) in 2023. The decrease in both years was attributable to lower outstanding balances resulting from
paying down principal as well as refinancing of debt for interest savings.
Other expense – Other expense includes miscellaneous non-operating expenses not classified in other
expense categories and accounted for 0.0% and 1.3% in 2024 and 2023, respectively. Other expense
decreased $17,036 (100.00%) in 2024 while Other Expense increased $11,915 (232.7%) in 2023. The
changes in both years resulted from activity related to retirement of capital assets, with 2024 activity
resulting in a small gain, and recognized under revenue, and prior activity resulting in a loss.
Capital Assets – Investments in capital assets include land and right-of-way, buildings and improvements,
leasehold improvements, revenue and non-revenue vehicles, shop and service equipment, security and
surveillance equipment, computer equipment, and furniture. RTD’s investment in capital assets, net of
accumulated depreciation in 2024 was $5,455,782 compared to $5,726,641 in 2023. The decrease in capital
assets in 2024 was $270,859 (4.7%) compared to a decrease of $238,499 (4.0%) in 2023. The decrease
in both years was due to additional accumulated depreciation, in addition to the retirement of 218 buses in
2024.

purchase and assignment agreement and a lease liability because of the implementation of Government
Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Statement 87. The 2024 outstanding debt was $2,817,900 compared
to $2,884,276 in 2023. Outstanding debt decreased by $66,376 (2.3%) in 2024 and decreased by $125,292
(4.2%) in 2023. The decrease in both years was due to payment of principal on outstanding debt with the
outstanding debt in both years also decreasing due to the completion of refinancings for interest savings.
Sales tax revenue bonds – RTD issues sales tax revenue bonds to fund the acquisition and construction
of assets. These bonds are secured by pledged future sales and use tax revenues. The sales tax revenue
bonds outstanding were $2,270,035 and $2,292,445 as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The
sales tax revenue bonds decreased $22,410 (1%) in 2024 compared to a decrease of $68,235 (2.8%) in
2023. The decrease in both years was due to payment of principal on outstanding debt with the decrease
in 2023 resulting from the issuance of Series 2023A bonds, the proceeds from which were used to refinance
other debt issuances for interest savings.
Certificates of participation - Certificates of participation (Certificates) relate to financial obligations
issued by the Asset Acquisition Authority, Inc. (Authority), a nonprofit corporation and component unit of
RTD. Certificates are lease-purchase financial obligations secured by the underlying assets. Outstanding
Certificates were issued with the proceeds being used to acquire certain equipment, facilities and
infrastructure to be used by RTD. For financial reporting purposes, RTD accounts for the Certificates as its
own debt. Certificates outstanding were $331,693 and $377,596 as of December 31, 2024 and 2023,
respectively. The Certificates outstanding decreased $45,903 (12.2%) in 2024 compared to a decrease of
$76,398 (16.8%) in 2023. The decrease in both years was the result of the issuance of the Series 2023
and 2024 Certificates, which were used to refinance outstanding issues for interest savings.

Economic Factors and Subsequent Events after adoption of the 2024 Budget
RTD is dependent on sales and use taxes, which are the largest single source of revenue for RTD,
representing 79.3% and 66.6% of the total revenues in 2024 and 2023, respectively. Sales and use tax
revenues are affected by the local economy in which consumer spending will affect the level of funding
available to RTD during its fiscal year. RTD’s 2024 sales and use taxes decreased 0.1% from the prior year
indicating a continued slowdown and recessionary pressure experienced in the local Denver economy
compared to the substantial increases seen prior to 2023.
RTD is dependent on passenger fares collected for transit services that it provides. Passenger fares
accounted for 5.9% of total revenues in 2024 and 4.9% in 2023. Passenger fare collections increased by
.6% 2024 as there was no Zero Fare for Better Air program during the year compared to the previous two
years. RTD undertook a significant change in its fare structure in 2024 making it simpler, more affordable,
and more equitable. Fares were lowered, the number of fare zones were reduced, and discount fares were
consolidated.
RTD is dependent on federal and local grant funding as well as local capital contributions for both operations
and capital expenditures. Grant operating assistance provided 4.9% and 18.2% of total revenues in 2024
and 2023, respectively. These grant apportionments primarily result from information provided by transit
agencies to the Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) National Transit Database (NTD). Due to the new
federal administration and its plans to reduce government spending, uncertainty exists as to how that will
impact future funding from the FTA and the effect this will have on RTD’s future operations.

NOTE A – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The Regional Transportation District (RTD) was created as a transportation planning agency,
a political subdivision of the State of Colorado, by an Act of the Colorado General Assembly
(the Act), effective July 1969 (Title 32, Article 9, C.R.S., 1973, as amended). In 1974, the
Act was amended and RTD became an operating entity charged with the responsibility for
development, operation and maintenance of a public mass transportation system for the
benefit of the citizens of the District. The District is comprised of 15 separate districts
located in Denver, Boulder, Broomfield and Jefferson counties, and certain portions of
Adams, Arapahoe, Douglas, and Weld counties.
RTD is governed by a publicly elected board of directors consisting of 15 members. Each
board member is elected to serve a term of four years by the constituents of the District in
which the board member resides. As required by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
(GAAP), these financial statements present RTD and its component units. The component
unit discussed in note A. 2. is included in RTD’s reporting entity because of the significance
its financial relationship with the RTD.
In 1988, a State Senate Bill was enacted (privatization legislation) requiring RTD to
implement by March 31, 1989, a plan to competitively bid contracts for the provision of at
least 20% of RTD’s bus service by private contractors. In 1999, the Bill was amended
requiring RTD to increase this provision to at least 35% of fixed route bus service. In 2003,
the Bill was amended to require that at least 50% of RTD’s vehicular service be operated
by private transit companies. In May of 2007, the legislation was amended to provide for “a
system under which up to 58% of the District’s service” is provided by private contractors.
2. Financial Reporting Entities
Blended Component Unit
The Asset Acquisition Authority, Inc. (Authority) was formed in 1987 as a nonprofit
corporation on behalf of RTD for the purpose of issuing certificates of participation in a
public offering collateralized by an installment purchase agreement with RTD. RTD’s
GM/CEO appoints the Board of Directors of the Authority. The Authority serves as a financing
mechanism for various financing arrangements for RTD. RTD follows Governmental
Accounting Standards Board (GASB) pronouncement 14 (GASB 14), as amended, which
provides guidance regarding the inclusion of component units in the primary government’s
financial statement presentation. The activity related to the underlying financial obligations
of the Authority has been included as a blended component unit in RTD’s financial
statements for the years ended December 31, 2024, and 2023.
No financial activity
occurred during 2024 or 2023, and no separately audited financial statements were
prepared either year, for the Authority.
Fiduciary Funds

Attachment: RTD 2024 ACFR (5140 : 2024 Annual Comprehensive Financial Report and Report to Governance)

1. Organization

GASB 84 requires that funds held in a trustee or custodial capacity that meet certain criteria
be included in RTD’s financial statement presentation. Those criteria include the
governmental agency having control of the assets of the fiduciary activity and the existence
of a fiduciary relationship with the beneficiaries. RTD has determined that the RTD Salaried
Pension Plan and RTD Salaried 401(a) Retirement Plan meet these fiduciary criteria and has

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Basis of Accounting
The accounts of RTD are reported as a Proprietary Fund. Proprietary funds are accounted
for on the flow of economic resources measurement focus and use the accrual basis of
accounting which reports all assets, deferred outflows of resources, liabilities, deferred
inflows of resources, revenues, expenses, gains and losses. Revenue is recognized when
earned and expenses are recorded at the time liabilities are incurred. Proprietary funds
distinguish operating revenues and expenses from non-operating items. Operating
revenues and expenses generally result from providing services and producing and
delivering goods in connection with a proprietary fund’s principal ongoing operations. The
principal operating revenues of RTD are charges (fares) to customers for services. Operating
expenses include the cost of services, administrative expenses and asset depreciation. All
revenues and expenses not meeting this definition are reported as non-operating revenues
and expenses.
It is RTD’s policy to apply GAAP in its presentation of financial statements. When both
restricted and unrestricted resources are available for use, it is RTD’s policy to use restricted
resources first, then unrestricted resources as they are needed.
4. Cash and Cash Equivalents
RTD considers all highly liquid investments, both restricted and unrestricted, with an original
maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
5. Interest Bearing Investments
Investments with a maturity date, when purchased, of less than one year are carried at cost
or amortized cost which approximates fair value. Investments with a maturity date of more
than one year from the date of purchase are carried at fair value.
6. Inventories
Inventories consist primarily of materials and supplies used in the ordinary course of
operations. Materials and supplies are stated at cost using the first-in, first-out (FIFO)
method.

7. Other Current Assets
Certain payments to vendors reflect costs applicable to future accounting periods and are
recorded as prepaid items. Escrows are deposits held in the custody of a third party until a
certain condition has been met such as retainage for construction projects. At the time
projects are completed, escrows are generally applied toward the cost of the project or may
be forfeited upon breach of contract.

Attachment: RTD 2024 ACFR (5140 : 2024 Annual Comprehensive Financial Report and Report to Governance)

included the financial activity of each in 2024 and 2023 in the financial statement section of
this report.

8. Receivables
Accounts receivables are stated at the amount management expects to collect from
outstanding balances. Management provides for probable uncollected amounts through a

48

Packet Pg. 186

2.16.D.b

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT
Notes to Financial Statements
December 31, 2024 and 2023 (Dollars in Thousands)
charge to earnings and a credit to a valuation allowance based on its assessment of the
status of individual accounts. Balances that are still outstanding after management has
used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the valuation
allowance and a credit to accounts receivable. Changes in the valuation allowance have not
been material to the financial statements.
9. Restricted Assets
Restricted assets are restricted by the covenants of long-term financial or other contractual
arrangements including unspent bond proceeds.
10. Capital Assets
Property and equipment are stated at historical cost. Capital assets are defined by RTD as
assets with an initial, individual cost of more than $5 and an estimated useful life more than
one year. Maintenance and repairs are charged to current period operating expenses and
improvements are capitalized. Upon retirement or other disposition of property and
equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective
accounts and any gains or losses are included in non-operating revenue and expense. A
pro-rata shares of proceeds from the sale of property and equipment, which were acquired
with federal funds, is required to be reinvested in a similar asset.
11. Depreciation
Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over
the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are as follows:
Land improvements
Buildings
Revenue earning equipment
Shop, maintenance and other equipment

10-20 years
30 years
8-25 years
3-10 years

12. Deferred Outflows/Inflows of Resources
In addition to assets, the statement of financial position will report a separate section for
deferred outflows of resources. This separate financial statement element represents a
consumption of net assets that applies to a future period(s) and thus, will not be recognized
as an outflow of resources (expense/expenditure) until then.
In addition to liabilities, the statement of financial position will sometimes report a separate
section for deferred inflows of resources. This separate financial statement element
represents an acquisition of net assets that applies to a future period(s) and so will not be
recognized as an inflow of resources (revenue) until that time.

13. Compensated Absences
RTD employees receive compensation for vacations, holidays, illness, and certain other
qualifying absences. The number of days compensated in the various categories of absence

49

Packet Pg. 187

2.16.D.b

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT
Notes to Financial Statements
December 31, 2024 and 2023 (Dollars in Thousands)
is based generally on length of service. A leave liability is recognized due to the leave
attributable to services already rendered, leave that accumulates, and leave that is more
likely than not to be used for time off or otherwise paid in cash or settled through noncash
means. Due to adoption of GASB 101, discussed further under number 20 of this section,
this liability also includes salary related payments, including Social Security and Medicare
taxes as well as salary related payments for defined contribution pension plans.
14. Self-Insurance
Liabilities for property damage, personal injury and qualifying unemployment benefits are
recognized as incurred on the basis of the estimated cost to RTD. In addition, RTD offers
a self-insured health benefit option as part of its employee benefits program in which costs
are recognized as they are incurred.
15. Revenue Recognition
Passenger Fares
Passenger fares are recorded as revenue at the time services are performed and revenue is
collected. Sale of mobile ticketing products, monthly passes, ticket books and day pass
tickets are recorded as income at the time of sale. Stored value sales are evaluated for
revenue recognition at the time services are performed. Sales of college-based passes,
which are valid for a specific academic semester, are recorded initially as unearned revenue
then recognized as income at the end of each month, with the amount recognized
determined by prorating the total contract amount over the semesters/quarters covered.
Sales of EcoPass and Neighborhood Pass, which are valid through December 31 of a given
year, are recorded initially as unearned revenue then recognized as income at the end of
each month, with the total contract amount prorated evenly over the number of months of
the contract.
Sales and Use Taxes
Under the provisions of the Act, as amended, RTD levies a sales tax of 1.0% on net taxable
sales made within the District and a use tax of 1.0% on items purchased for use inside the
District. As described in Note E, under the terms of the Sales Tax Revenue Bonds, Series
2007A, Series 2010B, Series 2013A, 2016A, 2017A, 2017B, 2019A, 2021A, 2021B, 2022A,
2022B and 2023A bond resolutions, sales and use tax revenue is pledged for payment of
debt service. Sales and use taxes are collected by the State of Colorado Department of
Revenue and are remitted to a trustee who satisfies debt service requirements for these
obligations through remittances to a trustee and then remits the remaining balance to RTD.
Sales and use taxes are recorded as revenue by RTD in the month collected by the
merchant. Sales tax bond service will be paid from the collateralized sales and use tax
revenues in the amount of approximately $3,492,475 through 2050. Principal and interest
paid for the current year were $116,872 and pledged revenues received were $857,411.

RTD receives grants from the federal government through the FTA. Grants are also awarded
to RTD by the State of Colorado through the Colorado Department of Transportation
(CDOT). The federal and state governments issue grants to RTD for operations and
acquisition of property and equipment.
The amount recorded as capital grant revenue was $15,429 and $39,216 in 2024 and 2023,
respectively. Operating assistance grant revenue was $52,951 and $234,488 in 2024 and
2023, respectively. Other contributed revenue was $12,965 and $14,465 in 2024 and 2023,
respectively.
Grants and local contributions are recorded as revenue by RTD once all applicable eligibility
requirements are met.
16. Use of Estimates
The financial statements contained herein have been prepared in accordance with
GAAP. GAAP are uniform minimum standards of and guidelines to financial accounting and
reporting. GAAP establishes appropriate measurement and classification criteria for
financial reporting. Adherence to GAAP provides a reasonable degree of comparability
among the financial reports of state and local governmental units. The preparation of
financial statements in accordance with GAAP involves the use of management’s estimates.
These estimates are based upon management’s best judgments after considering past and
current events and assumptions about future events. Actual results may differ from
estimates.
17. Pensions
For purposes of measuring RTD’s net pension liabilities, deferred outflows of resources and
deferred inflows of resources related to pensions and pension expense, information about
the pension plan’s fiduciary net position and additions to/deductions from the plan’s
fiduciary net position have been determined on the same basis as they are reported by the
plan. For this purpose, benefit payments (including refunds of employee contributions) are
recognized when due and payable in accordance with the benefit terms. Investments are
reported at fair value.
18. TABOR (Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights) – Reserve Composition
Restricted net position represents amounts constrained by external parties or legislation. In
1992, Colorado voters approved an amendment to the state constitution referred to as the
TABOR Amendment in which certain annual limitations were placed on the growth of
government revenues. The Amendment also requires that an emergency reserve, referred
to as Restricted TABOR, of 3.0% of fiscal year spending excluding debt service be
maintained for all years after 1994 for declared emergencies.

RTD is a lessee for noncancellable leases of land, office space and equipment. RTD
recognizes a lease liability and an intangible right-to-use lease asset (lease asset) in the
statement of net position.
At the commencement of a lease, RTD initially measures the lease liability at the present
value of payments expected to be made during the lease term. Subsequently, the lease
liability is reduced by the principal portion of lease payments made. The lease asset is
initially measured as the initial amount of the lease liability, adjusted for lease payments
made at or before the lease commencement date, plus certain initial direct costs.
Subsequently, the lease asset is amortized on a straight-line basis over its useful life.
Key estimates and judgments related to leases include how RTD determines (1) the
discount rate it uses to discount the expected lease payments to present value, (2) lease
term, and (3) lease payments.




RTD uses the interest rate charged by the lessor as the discount rate. When
the interest rate charged by the lessor is not provided, RTD generally uses its
estimated incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate for leases.
The lease term includes the noncancellable period of the lease. Lease payments
included in the measurement of the lease liability are composed of fixed
payments and purchase option price that RTD is reasonably certain to exercise.

RTD monitors changes in circumstances that would require a remeasurement of its lease
and will remeasure the lease asset and liability if certain changes occur that are expected
to significantly affect the amount of the lease liability.
Lease assets are reported with other capital assets and lease liabilities are reported with
the short-term portion combined with long-term debt and the long-term portion is stated
separately on the statement of net position. RTD is a lessor for noncancellable leases of
buildings, land, office space, parking space and use of RTD physical resources for
advertising space. RTD recognizes a lease receivable and a deferred inflow of resources in
the statement of net position.
At the commencement of a lease, RTD initially measures the lease receivable at the present
value of payments expected to be received during the lease term. Subsequently, the lease
receivable is reduced by the principal portion of lease payments received. The deferred
inflow of resources is initially measured as the initial amount of the lease receivable,
adjusted for lease payments received at or before the lease commencement date.
Subsequently, the deferred inflow of resources is recognized as revenue over the life of the
lease term.
Key estimates and judgments include how RTD determines the discount rate it uses to
discount the expected lease receipts to present value, lease term, and lease receipts.

20. Accounting Changes and Error Corrections

Adoption of new Accounting Pronouncements
During the current year, the District adopted GASB Statement No. 101,
Compensated Absences. As a result, the liability for compensated absences in the
statement of net position has been calculated to comply with this new
pronouncement. The financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022,
have been restated to adopt GASB Statement No. 101. These changes are reflected
in the Current Liability and Salary and Wages lines of the Condensed Summary
Statements of Net Position, the Summary of Revenues, Expenses, and Changes in
Net Position and the Expense schedules in the Management ‘s Discussion and
Analysis. The effects of this adoption of a new accounting pronouncement are shown
in the table at the end of this section.

Adjustments to and Restatements of Beginning Balances
The changes noted above resulted in adjustments to and restatements of beginning
net position at December 31, 2022 as follows:

21. Upcoming Accounting Pronouncements

GASB 102
In December 2023, the Governmental Accounting Standards Board issued
Statement No. 102, Certain Risk Disclosures, which requires a government to
assess whether a concentration or constraint makes the primary government or
other reporting units that report a liability for revenue debt vulnerable to the risk
of a substantial impact. It also requires a government to assess whether an event
or events associated with a concentration or constraint that could cause the
substantial impact to have occurred, have begun to occur, or are more likely than
not to occur within 12 months of the date of the financial statements are issued.
If certain criteria are met for a concentration or constraint, disclosures are required
in the notes to the financial statements. The provisions of this statement are

NOTE B – DEPOSITS AND INVESTMENTS

RTD’s deposits are subject to the State of Colorado’s Public Deposit Protection Act (PDPA). Under
this act, all uninsured public deposits at qualified institutions are fully collateralized with pledged
collateral which is held in custody by any Federal Reserve Bank or branch thereof, or held in
escrow by another bank in a manner as the banking Commissioner shall prescribe by rule and
regulation, or may be segregated from the other assets of the eligible public depository and held
in its own trust department. Colorado’s PDPA requires that pledged collateral to be held is clearly
identified as being securely maintained or pledged for the aggregate amount of public deposits
accepted and held on deposit by the eligible public depository. The public depository has the right
at any time to make substitutions of eligible collateral that is maintained or pledged and is always
entitled to collect and retain all income derived from those investments without restrictions.
As of December 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively, RTD had bank deposits of $5,344 and $6,454
collateralized with securities held by the pledging financial institutions’ trust department or agent
but not in RTD’s name.

Fiduciary Funds
Fiduciary fund investments of $220,136 and $195,235 on December 31, 2024 and 2023,
respectively, consist of a broad spectrum of individual holdings of cash and cash equivalents,
equity mutual funds and fixed income mutual funds. Because these investments are primarily
mutual funds consisting of multiple investments and contain equity investments, credit ratings
of the underlying portfolios are not available.

Concentration of Credit Risk
Enterprise Funds
It is the policy of RTD to diversify its investment portfolio. Assets held in the investment funds
shall be diversified to eliminate the risk of loss resulting from over-concentration of assets in a
specific maturity, a specific issue, or a specific class of securities. The asset allocation in the
portfolio should, however, be flexible depending upon the outlook for the economy and the
securities markets.
RTD’s investment policy outlines the following maximum exposure limits for unrestricted
investments. As of December 31, 2024, RTD followed these limits. As of December 31, 2023,
RTD was following limitations set out in RTD’s previous investment policy limitations.

Fair Value Measurements
In March 2015, the GASB released Statement No. 72, Fair Value Measurement and Application,
which would generally require state and local governments to measure investments at fair
value. GASB's goal is to enhance comparability of governmental financial statements by
requiring fair value measurement for certain assets and liabilities using a consistent definition
and accepted valuation techniques. This standard expands fair value disclosures to provide
comprehensive information for financial statement users about the impact of fair value
measurements on a government's financial position.
Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in an active market for identical assets or liabilities that RTD
can access at the measurement date. Examples are derived values from the New York Stock
Exchange (NYSE), National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ),
Chicago Board of Trade and “Pink Sheets”.

Attachment: RTD 2024 ACFR (5140 : 2024 Annual Comprehensive Financial Report and Report to Governance)

be invested in agencies if such investments satisfy the requirements of CRS 24.75.601.1 (m) which limits the maturity
from the date of settlement to three years, provided that the book value limits of CRS 24.75.601.1 (m) (II) shall not
apply. Rather, the diversification limit shall be set as follows: no more than 75% of the portfolio may be invested in
agencies, with any more than 25% being invested in any one agency.

Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices under Level 1 that are observable for the asset or
liability, either directly or indirectly on the measurement date. Examples include matrix pricing,
market corroborated pricing and inputs such as yield curves and indices.

December 31, 2024 and 2023 (Dollars in Thousands)
Level 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability used to measure fair value that rely on
the reporting entity's reasonably available information concerning the assumptions that market
participants would use in pricing an asset or liability including assumptions about risk.
Examples include investment manager pricing for private placement, private equities and hedge
funds.

(1) Real estate investment trusts invest primarily in commercial and residential real estate. The fund focuses on properties with

high quality physical improvements, stabilized occupancies and competitive positions within their markets that produce a
relatively high level of current income combined with moderate appreciation potential.
(2) The common collective trusts measured at the NAV invest primarily in asset-backed securities, corporate bonds, U.S. government
agency securities and foreign common stocks. The investment objectives include matching the return of the Barclay’s Aggregate

Bond Index through investment in substantially all of the bonds contained in that index and matching the MSCI All Country World
ex-U.S. Index (Net) benchmark.
(3) Defensive equity funds invest primarily in collateralized put ad call options composed of 50 percent U.S. equities and 50 percent
U.S. Treasury bills that is expected to produce the strongest relative performance when the S&P is experiencing modes it negative
returns. The fair value of this investment has been determined using NAV per share (or its equivalent) of the investee funds.
(4) Private credit funds pool investor capital to invest primarily in private loans which are not broadly syndicated securities. The
focus is senior-secured loans made directly to U.S. mid-sized corporate borrowers, diversified by company. Typically, these
loans earn variable, high income yield based on a percentage spread above a floating reference rate such as Secured
Overnight Financing Rate. The underlying loans do not trade in active markets and entail credit risk while having limited
interest rate risk.

Investments in Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share
RTD holds shares or interests in investment companies where the fair value of in the investments
is measured on a recurring basis using net asset value per share (or its equivalent) of the
investment companies as a practical expedient.
RTD’s investments in the Colorado Local Government Liquid Asset Trust (COLOTRUST) are
measured at the net asset value method. There are no unfunded commitments, the redemption
frequency is daily, and there is no redemption notice period. RTD’s investment in COLOTRUST
was $20,111 and $43,473 as of December 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively.

Investments in Entities That Calculate Amortized Cost
RTD’s investment in Colorado Statewide Investment Pool (CSIP) is measured at amortized cost
and, therefore, is not categorized in a level. The trust is like a money market fund, with each
share valued at $1.00. RTD’s investment in CSIP was $25,176 and $33,603 as of December 31,
2024, and 2023, respectively.
RTD’s investment in the Colorado Surplus Asset Fund Trust (CSAFE) is measured at amortized
cost and, therefore, is not categorized in a level. The trust is similar to a money market fund,
with each share valued at $1.00. RTD’s investment in CSAFE was $411,469 and $427,916 as of
December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
RTD’s investment in the Wells Fargo Stagecoach Sweep-Allsprings money market fund is
measured at amortized cost and, therefore, is not categorized in a level. The trust is similar to
a money market fund, with each share valued at $1.00. RTD’s investment in Wells Fargo
Stagecoach was $47,060 and $83,948 as of December 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively.

ATU 1001 Pension Plan – Defined Benefit (2024)
Plan Description
The Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1001 (ATU) Pension Plan was established pursuant to a
collective bargaining agreement (CBA) between RTD and the ATU. This plan covers substantially
all full-time union-represented employees in accordance with the CBA. The plan is a single
employer defined benefit pension plan administered by Compusys, Inc.

Benefits Provided
All benefits are paid in the form of a 50% joint and survivor annuity unless this form is rejected
by the participant and the spouse.
Normal retirement benefits under the ATU Plan are paid to participants who have attained age
65 and have been in the ATU Plan for 10 years. The benefit amount is based on final average
earnings, years of employment and age at the date of retirement.
Effective January 1, 1992, any participant who has accumulated 20 or more years of credited
service and terminated employment prior to attaining age 50 will be entitled to an early retirement
benefit starting on the first day of any month after attaining age 50. The ATU Plan was
subsequently amended effective January 1, 2011, for new employees in which the years of
credited service needed to qualify for a normal retirement benefit was increased from five to 10
years and the benefit multiplier for both the normal and early retirement was revised.
Death benefits state if an employee who is not eligible for a vested benefit or not eligible to retire,
should die, their beneficiary will be paid the accumulated employee contributions plus interest.
Prior to 2023, upon the death of a pensioner, a funeral benefit of $2 (two thousand dollars) will
be paid in a lump sum to the pensioner’s designated beneficiary. One June 2, 2023, the Board
of Trustees agreed that the death benefit will no longer be paid out of the Pension Plan. This
benefit shall be paid pursuant to the ATU Local 1001 Health and Welfare Trust effective January
1, 2023.
An individual who becomes totally disabled prior to age 65 and retires from active employment
with RTD as a direct result of being totally disabled is entitled to a disability retirement benefit
provided, if they have worked for at least 10 years for RTD in covered employment. An individual
will be considered totally disabled upon receipt of a disability award from the Social Security
Administration. Effective January 1, 2011, the years of credited service needed to qualify for a
disability benefit was increased from five to 10 years and the benefit multiplier was revised.

Attachment: RTD 2024 ACFR (5140 : 2024 Annual Comprehensive Financial Report and Report to Governance)

*The ATU 1001 Pension Plan deferred outflow of resources related to contributions made after the
measurement date were $19,656. The Salaried Pension Plan deferred outflow of resources related to
contributions made after the measurement date were $15,000.

An individual who terminated employment on or after January 1, 1993, for any reason other than
retirement, will be entitled to a deferred vested benefit at age 65 provided they had worked for
at least 10 years in covered employment for RTD. A participant is entitled to deferred, vested
benefits as early as age 50 if they have worked for at least 20 years in covered employment and
terminates active employment on or after attaining age 50. If an individual with 20 or more years
of service terminated employment prior to age 50, benefits will be payable at any time after age

a Single Discount Rate that reflects (1) a long-term expected rate of return on pension plan
investments (to the extent that the plan’s fiduciary net position is projected to be sufficient to
pay benefits) and (2) tax-exempt municipal bond rate based on an index of 20-year general
obligation bonds with an average AA credit rating as of the measurement date (to the extent that
the plan’s projected fiduciary net position is not sufficient to pay benefits).
For this valuation, the expected rate of return on pension plan investments is 6.50%; the
municipal bond rate is 3.77% (based on the daily rate closest to but not later than the
measurement date of Fidelity Index’s “20-Year Municipal GO AA Index as of December 31, 2023”);
and the resulting Single Discount Rate is 6.50%.
The projection of cash flows used to determine the discount rate would be equal to the actuarially
determined contribution rate for the applicable fiscal years. Based on those assumptions, the
pension plan’s fiduciary net position was projected to be available to make all projected future
benefit payments of current plan members.

Development of the Single Discount Rate
Single discount rate is 6.50%
Long-term expected rate of investment return is 6.50%
Long-term municipal bond rate is 3.77%
Actuarial return assumption 6.50%

Changes to Assumptions and Benefits
The rate of investment return on the market values of assets during the 2023 measurement
period was 11.87%. the rate of investment return on the actuarial value of assets was 7.39%,
which led to a $3,800 gain primarily due to better than assumed investment experience.
The plan had a gain of $1,300 under liabilities largely driven by favorable mortality experience
for members receiving benefits.

Salaried Pension Plan - Defined Benefit (2024)
Plan Description
The RTD Salaried Employees’ Pension Plan provides coverage for all full-time salaried employees
who were hired prior to January 1, 2008. The plan is a single employer defined benefit pension
plan administered by Benesys.

Benefits Provided
Normal retirement eligibility age is 65 with five years of credited service; monthly benefit 2.5%
of average final compensation times credited service. Early retirement age is 55 with five years
of credited service, the monthly benefit if one retires or terminates from active status on or after
age 55 is reduced 1/30 for each year less than age 60. If the employee terminates from active
status prior to age 55, the normal retirement benefit is reduced 1/15 for each year between ages
60 and 65 and 1/30 for each year less than age 60.
The disability provisions apply to fully vested participants who are totally and permanently
disabled and entitled to a Social Security disability award. The payout amount is the unreduced
accrued normal pension retirement, payable upon approval for Social Security disability.
Termination eligibility is five years of credited service, otherwise a lump sum payment will be
made equal to the present value of the age 65 accrued benefits payable in lieu of all other
benefits.
Forms of annuity payments for normal retirement are 50% joint and survivor if married, otherwise
retirement benefits are for a single annuity with no survivor option. Optional forms of retirement
benefits are 25%, 50%, 66-2/3% or 100% joint and survivor annuity with five-year or ten-year
certain and life annuity.
Credited service is one year for each calendar year of 1,000 hours of service (except years and
completed months in the year of transfer). Credited service applies to vesting and service for
retirement benefit eligibility. Average final compensation is the average of the participant's
highest consecutive 36 months of compensation in the last 120 months of credited service
immediately preceding the calendar month in which retirement occurs. Compensation excludes
bonuses, severance pay, long-term disability pay and other extra compensation paid in the fiscal
year. Compensation includes deferrals made to the RTD Deferred Compensation Plan and RTD
Flexible Spending Account Plan, overtime, shift differentials, leave pay and salary reductions.

benefits will still accrue. These obligations will not be released until the final participant receives
their final benefit payment.

Contributions
Employee contributions are a source of revenue for the Trust and prior to 2013 were based on
a percentage of the RTD’s salaried employees’ base compensation. Due to the decreasing active
population and resulting reduction in future expected payroll, the RTD Board approved a funding
policy effective January 1, 2013, where the recommended dollar contribution up to a cap of $3.1
million is made to the Trust each year. This funding policy was established with the goal of
achieving 100% funding by the end of 2032; however, due to net actuarial losses, the RTD Board
adopted a new funding policy effective in 2016 to remove the $3.1 million maximum and allowed
for an amount to be contributed to keep the Trust “actuarially sound” based on recommendations
from the Trust’s actuary and RTD’s Chief Financial Officer. Note that the recommended
contribution can fluctuate annually due to such factors as projected total base compensation,
investment results, and retirement patterns of participants. RTD contributed $15 million in 2024
and $15 million in 2023.

Actuarial Assumptions
The total pension liability was determined by an actuarial valuation with a date of January 1,
2023, using the following actuarial assumptions applied to all periods included in the
measurement with a liability roll forward to the measurement date of December 31, 2023:

The long-term expected rates of return on pension plan investments were determined using
a building-block method in which best estimate ranges of expected future real rates of return
are developed for each major asset class. These ranges are combined to produce the long-term
expected rate of return by weighting the expected future real rates of return by the target asset
allocation percentage including expected inflation.
The best estimates of arithmetic real rates of return for each major asset class included in the
target asset allocation as of December 31, 2023 (for disclosure purposes for the fiscal year
ending December 31, 2024) are summarized in the following table and reflect assumed long-term

Changes to Assumptions

The trustees approved a change in the salary scale assumption as of January 1, 2023 to reflect a
flat 6.00% annual salary increase beginning in 2023. The net impact of this assumption change
was an increase in the Actuarial Accrued Liability of $7.1 million and an increase in the normal
cost of $0.2 million, resulting in a recommended increase to the contribution for 2024 Fiscal Year
of $1.3 million.

The discount rate used to measure the total pension liability was 7.00%. The projection of
cash flows used to determine the discount rate assumed that RTD contributions would be equal
to the actuarially determined contribution rate for the applicable fiscal years. Based on those
assumptions, the pension plan’s fiduciary net position was projected to be available to make all
projected future benefit payments of current plan members.
Therefore, the long-term
expected rate of return on pension plan investments was applied to all periods of projected
benefit payments to determine the total pension liability. The discount rate does not
incorporate nor require a 20-year tax-exempt general obligation municipal bond rate (with an
average rating of AA/Aa or higher).

Sensitivity of the Net Pension Liability to Changes in the Discount Rate
The following presents the net pension liability as of fiscal year end December 31, 2024
(measurement date of December 31, 2023) calculated using the discount rate of 7.00%, as

Employee contributions are a source of revenue for the Trust and prior to 2013 were based on
a percentage of the RTD’s salaried employees’ base compensation. Due to the decreasing active
population and resulting reduction in future expected payroll, the RTD Board approved a funding
policy effective January 1, 2013, where the recommended dollar contribution up to a cap of $3.1
million is made to the Trust each year. This funding policy was established with the goal of
achieving 100% funding by the end of 2032; however, due to net actuarial losses, the RTD Board
adopted a new funding policy effective in 2016 to remove the $3.1 million maximum and allowed
for an amount to be contributed to keep the Trust “actuarially sound” based on recommendations
from the Trust’s actuary and RTD’s Chief Financial Officer. Note that the recommended
contribution can fluctuate annually due to such factors as projected total base compensation,
investment results, and retirement patterns of participants. RTD contributed $15 million in 2023
and $8.4 million in 2022.

Actuarial Assumptions
The total pension liability was determined by an actuarial valuation with a date of January 1,
2022, using the following actuarial assumptions applied to all periods included in the
measurement with a liability roll forward to December 31, 2022:
Inflation
Salary increases
Investment rate of return, net of investment expenses

2.75%
3.70% – 6.45%, based on age
7.00%

The long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments was determined using a
building-block method in which best estimate ranges of expected future real rates of return are
developed for each major asset class. These ranges are combined to produce the long-term
expected rate of return by weighting the expected future real rates of return by the target asset
allocation percentage including expected inflation.
The best estimates of arithmetic real rates of return for each major asset class included in the
target asset allocation as of the December 31, 2022 measurement date (for disclosure purposes
for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023) are summarized in the following data and reflect
assumed long-term expected real rate of return over a 30-year horizon upon which the disclosure
is based:

Mortality Rates for Lump Sums (25% Election Assumption)
RP-2014 Mortality tables for healthy employees and annuitants (adjusted to 2006) and projected
to 2022 using the MP-2017 mortality improvement scale, blended 70% male/30% female for
participants and 30% male/70% female for beneficiaries.
The actuarial assumptions used in the January 1, 2022 evaluation were based on the results of
an actuarial experience study covering the period January 1, 2018 – December 31, 2021.

Single Discount Rate
The discount rate used to measure the total pension liability was 7.00%. The projection of
cash flows used to determine the discount rate assumed that RTD contributions would be equal
to the actuarially determined contribution rate for the applicable fiscal years. Based on those
assumptions, the fiduciary net position was projected to be available to make all projected
future benefit payments for current plan members. Therefore, the long-term expected rate of
return on investments was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine
the total pension liability. The discount rate does not incorporate nor require a 20-year taxexempt general obligation municipal bond rate (with an average rating of AA/Aa or higher).

Sensitivity of the Net Pension Liability to Changes in the Discount Rate
The following presents the net pension liability as of fiscal year end December 31, 2023,

RTD Plan – 401(a) Defined Contribution
The RTD defined contribution plan is available for full-time salaried employees hired after January
1, 2008. The RTD Board adopted Amendment 8, effective January 1, 2008, for which RTD
currently contributes the board approved 9% of the employee’s qualifying wages. Contributions
totaled $9,272 and $7,813 in 2024 and 2023, respectively. RTD employees cannot contribute to
this plan. Membership was 926 and 849 active employees in 2024 and 2023, respectively.
RTD/ATU 1001 401(a) Defined Contribution Plan and 457 (b) Deferred Compensation
Plan
This plan became available for new members of ATU 1001 hired on or after January 1, 2023.
Eligible employees include any newly hired member of the ATU who is 19 years old in addition to
Part Time Retirees (as defined in the CBA). Eligibility for the 457(b) plan begins on the first day
of the month following completion of election form for Pre-tax and/or Roth contributions to the
Plan. Eligibility for the 401(a) Plan begins on the employee’s date of hire or immediately for PartTime Retirees. Contributions under the 457(b) Plan can be made by the employee up to the
applicable annual IRS limits, including catch-up and Roth (after-tax) contributions. RTD will make
a non-elective contribution each pay period to the 401(a) Plan equal to 9% of each eligible
employees per-pay-period compensation.
Employee contributions (pre-tax and/or Roth
contributions) to the 457(b) plan will be matched by RTD equal to 100% up to 5% of the
employee’s per-pay-period compensation. Employees are always fully vested under the 457(b)
plan. Under the ATU 401(a) plan, 20% vesting will occur for each full year of completed service,
with 100% vesting occurring after five years of completed service, upon attaining age of 65, or
upon death or disability. Part-time Retirees are always fully vested. 2024 contributions by RTD
under the 401(a) plan were $2,990. RTD made an additional match of $1,178 to the 457(b) plan.
Employee contributions during 2024 to the 457(b) plan were $1,303. As of December 31, 2024,
there were 523 employees participating in the plan.

The Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1001 Health and Welfare Trust (Trust) was formed
pursuant to a Trust Agreement effective July 1, 1971, between ATU, Local 1001 and an agent of
a transit enterprise owned by the City and County of Denver, through July 3, 1974, and RTD
thereafter. In addition to the original Denver Metro Division, employees of other RTD divisions
have been approved for participation in the Trust benefits. The Trust agreement shall continue

The Trust provides health benefits (hospital, medical, dental, vision, life and short-term disability)
for represented employees of RTD and certain officers of the ATU and health care benefits for
retired employees who actively worked 600 hours or more per quarter. The Trust is funded
through contributions by the employer and employee in which the share of benefit plan
contributions is set by the CBA. RTD’s contribution was $29,039 and $26,524 for the years ended
December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Trust also provides insurance coverage for
felonious assault for each employee. The Trust self-insures part of its health, life insurance and
short-term disability benefits. The Trust issues audited financial statements which include
financial information for the plan. Those audited financial statements may be obtained from the
Trust: RTD ATU 1001 Health and Welfare Trust, 2821 S. Parker Road, Suite 215 Aurora, Colorado
80014-2602.
Other Post Employment Benefits
Prior to the closure of the ATU 1001 Pension plan to new hires beginning January 1, 2023 there
was a $2 funeral benefit paid to survivors of retirees when they die. To ensure this benefit
continues to be available to all ATU members, regardless of their hire date, trustees of the plan
voted in 2023 to move this benefit out of the pension plan and into the Health and Welfare plan
discussed above. After an actuarial review, RTD has determined that the net OPEB liability is not
material and therefore did not apply the provisions of GASB 74 or 75.
RTD Employees Deferred Compensation Plan
RTD offers its employees an unearned compensation plan (Plan), created in accordance with
Internal Revenue Code Section 457, which is available to substantially all employees (with the
exception below) and permits them to defer a portion of their compensation to future years.
Under the terms of the Plan, the unearned compensation is available to participants upon
termination, retirement, death or in the event of an unforeseeable emergency or other financial
hardship. RTD makes no contributions to this plan as contributions are voluntarily made by RTD
employees only. New members of ATU 1001 hired on or after January 1, 2023, are not able to
participate in this plan as there was a separate deferred compensation plan established for these
employees as described above.
Compensated Absences
RTD considers all accrued compensated absences as due within one year. Employees accrue paid
time off (PTO), vacation and sick leave based on years of service. Employees are not allowed to
accumulate more than twice their annual PTO or vacation accrual and sick leave based on years
of service. Employees are paid any outstanding compensated absence balances upon leaving
RTD. A leave liability is recognized due to the leave attributable to services already rendered,
leave that accumulates, and leave that is more likely than not to be used for time off or otherwise
paid in cash or settled through noncash means. The leave liability also includes associated salaryrelated payments, including employer FICA and Medicare taxes as well as employer paid
payments made to defined contribution pension plans.

Under the provisions of current grants, RTD is obligated to satisfy certain matching requirements.
As of December 31, 2024, RTD had a commitment to provide $119,015 in matching funds to
receive $218,461 in future federal and state grant funds. Of those amounts, $87,865 in matching
funds, $157,872 in federal, is a result of RTD acting as the project sponsor and pass through
agency in partnership with the City and County of Denver on the East Colfax Bus Rapid Transit
project.

Privatization Contracts
RTD has awarded contracts for specific groups of fixed route services not to exceed 58% as
required by state law. As of December 31, 2024, 54.33% of RTD’s non-rail transit services are
delivered by private contractors operating under the auspices and direction of RTD.

ADA Paratransit Service
Consistent with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990, RTD provides complementary
paratransit service to persons with disabilities unable to use RTD’s fixed route system. This
service, branded Access-a-Ride, is a curb-to-curb transportation service. Customers eligible for
Access-a-Ride services must originate their trip within 3/4 of a mile of an RTD fixed route. Since
September 1996, RTD has been in full compliance with the ADA requirement to provide
complementary paratransit service to persons with disabilities unable to use the fixed route
system.
Future Commitments under Construction Contracts
RTD has no individual material commitments under construction contracts but will continue to
incur construction costs related to maintaining infrastructure in a state of good repair in
accordance with standards of the Transit Asset Management (TAM) Plan. Many infrastructure
assets will begin to reach the end of their useful life benchmarks indicating a need for repair and
replacement; however, specific commitments have not yet been entered.

The projected amounts include an estimation for certain future inflation indexes as required by
the concessionaire agreement. These inflation indexes will be adjusted annually as projects are
revised.

Diesel Fuel Contract
RTD contracts with Mansfield Oil Company, Inc. (Mansfield) for diesel fuel for buses. The contract
is structured as a single year contract. RTD estimates 2024 usage of approximately 6.5 million
gallons: 3.90 million gallons of RTD’s usage and 2.60 million gallons of RTD’s private contractors’
usage.
The estimated locked-in price commitment under the Mansfield contract in 2024 is for 6.5 million
gallons of diesel fuel for both RTD and private contractors at $2.9894 per gallon or $19,431.
Contingencies

Federal Grants
RTD receives federal grants for capital projects and operating assistance, which are subject to
reviews by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA). Although the outcome of any such review
cannot be predicted, it is management’s opinion these reviews will not result in liabilities to such
an extent that they would materially affect RTD’s financial position.

Self-Insurance
RTD is self-insured for general liability and Workers’ Compensation claims. Liabilities are reported
when it is probable that a loss has occurred, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably
estimated. In addition, RTD offers a self-insured health benefit option as part of its employee
benefits program in which costs are recognized as they are incurred.

Commitments to the Eagle P3 concessionaire, Denver Transit Partners, LLC (DTP), are as follows:

RTD does not carry excess liability insurance for personal injury and property damage. Under
the provisions of the Colorado Government Immunity Act, the maximum liability, with certain
exceptions as defined in the Act, to RTD for claims involving personal injury and property damage
is $387 per individual and $1,093 per incident for claims arising on or after January 1, 2018, and

For worker’s compensation, an excess coverage insurance policy covers individual claims more
than $2,000. The number of settlements has not exceeded insurance coverage in any of the past
three years.
RTD’s liability for unpaid claims includes an amount for claims that have been incurred but not
reported (IBNR). RTD’s Risk Management Division determines incurred claims by investigating
the accident and establishing a reserve. Reserves are established on the day of assignment,
reviewed at 30 days and again at 90 days. Reserves are reviewed every 90 days thereafter and
based on ultimate exposure. This amount is included in other accrued expenses in the statement
of net assets. Changes in the balances of claims liabilities for both general liability and worker’s
compensation during the past year are as follows:

Contract Disputes and Legal Proceedings
RTD is party to several pending or threatened tort lawsuits, workers’ compensation claims, or
labor/employment claims under which it may be required to pay certain amounts upon final
disposition of these matters. RTD also has certain contract disputes being considered in
contractual dispute resolution proceedings. RTD’s legal counsel estimates that the ultimate
outcome of these matters is sufficiently covered by RTD’s general liability or worker’s
compensation reserves, project contingencies, or insurance, or would not otherwise materially
affect the financial statements of RTD.
In 2018, DTP, RTD’s concessionaire for its Eagle P3 Project, filed a lawsuit asserting force majeure
and change in law claims and damages of approximately $111 million against RTD. DTP claimed
that the Colorado Public Utilities Commission and/or the Federal Railroad Administration created
new interpretations of existing regulations, and that DTP was therefore entitled to risk allocation
in its favor of costs incurred.

A four-week bench trial on the claims began on September 21, 2020. On February 10, 2023, the
court issued its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order for Entry of Judgment finding in
favor of RTD on DTP’s above claims.
DTP filed its notice of appeal on March 30, 2023. Briefing in the Colorado Court of Appeals was

On May 9, 2024, the Colorado Court of Appeals issued its opinion affirming the District Court’s
judgement in RTD’s favor, agreeing that regulators applied existing law and no change in law
occurred. In response to the May 9 decision by the Colorado Court of Appeals, DTP filed a petition
for a rehearing on May 22, 2024.
On June 20, 2024, the Court of Appeals added two supplementary paragraphs in support of its
original opinion but did not change its affirmation of the judgement in RTD’s favor. On July 17,
2024, DTP filed a petition of certiorari with the Colorado Supreme Court.
The Colorado Supreme Court denied DTP’s petition for certiorari on February 3, 2025, rejecting
DTP’s request for the court to hear its appeal thus bringing the litigation to a close.

RTD’s annual budget is prepared on the same basis as that used for accounting except that the
budget also includes proceeds of long-term debt and capital grants as revenue and expenditures
include capital outlays and obligation principal payments and excludes TABOR refunds under
Amendment 1 of the Colorado Constitution, extraordinary loss, and depreciation on, as well as
gains and losses on disposition of property and equipment. The budget sets forth all proposed
outlays for operations, planning, administration, development, debt service, and capital outlays
for the fiscal year. Prior to October 15, the General Manager and CEO submits to the Board of
Directors a proposed operating and capital budget for the fiscal year commencing the following
January 1, which is made available for public inspection and comment. On or before
December 31, the budget is adopted in conjunction with an appropriation resolution by the Board
of Directors, which must also approve subsequent amendments not delegated under the authority
of the General Manager and CEO. In the absence of such budget adoption and appropriation by
the Board of Directors, RTD has authority to begin making expenditures in the new fiscal year
that are limited to 90% of the prior year’s approved appropriation. RTD’s policy on budget
transfers authorizes the General Manager and CEO to approve certain transfers within the budget
as delegated by the Board of Directors.
A reconciliation for the years ended December 31 of the annual budget, as amended, to actual
revenue and expenses is as follows:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In November 1992, Colorado voters passed an amendment (Amendment 1) to the State
Constitution (Article X, Section 20) that limits the revenue raising and spending abilities of state
and local governments known as the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights (TABOR). The limits on property
taxes, revenue, and “fiscal year spending” include allowable annual increases tied to inflation and
local growth in construction valuation. Fiscal year spending as defined by the amendment
excludes spending from certain revenue and financing sources such as federal funds, gifts,
property sales, fund transfers, damage awards, and fund reserves. Amendment 1 requires voter
approval for any increase in mill levy tax rates, new taxes, or creation of multi-year debt. Revenue
earned in excess of the “spending limit” must be refunded to the taxpayers unless voters approve
retention of these revenues. In addition, Amendment 1 mandates that reserves equal to 3% of
fiscal spending be established for declared emergencies.
On November 7, 1995, the voters of the District exempted RTD from the revenue and spending
limitations concerning Amendment 1 through December 31, 2005. On November 2, 1999, the
voters of the District further exempted RTD from the revenue and spending limitations outlined
in Amendment 1 for the purpose of paying any debt incurred to finance the Southeast and
Southwest Corridor light rail projects or to operate such projects for as long as any debt remains
outstanding, but in no event beyond December 31, 2026.
On November 2, 2004, the voters of the District authorized an increase in RTD’s sales and use
tax rate from 0.6% to 1.0%, effective January 1, 2005, to finance the FasTracks transit
improvement program. This authorization also exempted RTD from any revenue and spending
limitations on the additional tax and on any investment, income generated by the increased tax
revenue and allowed RTD to incur debt to finance the capital improvements included in the
FasTracks program. At the time that all FasTracks debt is repaid in 2050, RTD’s 0.4% sales and
use tax rate will be reduced to a rate sufficient to operate the transit system financed through
FasTracks.
On November 5, 2024, voters approved Ballot Measure 7A which allows RTD to continue being
exempt from TABOR revenue growth limitations in perpetuity.

NOTE L – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
On February 3, 2025, the Colorado Supreme Court denied DTP’s petition for certiorari regarding
an ongoing lawsuit disputing costs incurred by DTP related to commuter rail gate crossings. This
ruling brings this matter to a close.
On March 12, 2025, the Board of Directors authorized the General Manager and CEO to enter into
a three-year collective bargaining agreement with the Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) Lodge 72.
This agreement is the first agreement between RTD and the FOP for labor representation for the
positions below Sergent in the RTD Police Department. This agreement is not anticipated to have
a material financial impact to RTD.

NOTE K – TAX, SPENDING AND DEBT LIMITATIONS

On March 27, 2025, RTD and the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1001 completed negotiations
and reached a tentative agreement for a three-year collective bargaining agreement following the
expiration of the previous contract on December 31, 2024. Member ratification is expected in
June. This agreement is within the planned financial appropriations approved by the Board of
Directors.

To the Board of Directors
Regional Transportation District
Denver, Colorado
We have audited the financial statements of the Regional Transportation District (RTD or the “District”) as
of and for the year ended December 31, 2024 and have issued our report thereon dated May 27, 2025.
Professional standards require that we provide you with the following information related to our audit, which
is divided into the following sections:
Section I - Required Communications with Those Charged with Governance
Section II - Recommendations and Legislative and Informational Items
Section I includes information that we are required to communicate to those individuals charged with
governance of RTD. This section communicates significant matters related to the audit that are, in our
professional judgment, relevant to your responsibilities in overseeing the financial reporting process.
Section II contains recommendations and updated legislative and informational items that we believe will
be of interest to you.
We would like to take this opportunity to thank RTD’s staff for the cooperation and courtesy extended to us
during our audit. Their assistance and professionalism are invaluable.
This report is intended solely for the use of the board of directors and management of RTD and is not
intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties.
We welcome any questions you may have regarding the following communications, and we would be willing
to discuss these or any other questions that you might have at your convenience.
Very truly yours,
Plante & Moran, PLLC

2.16.D.c

Our Responsibility Under U.S. Generally Accepted Auditing Standards
As stated in our engagement letter dated January 7, 2025, our responsibility, as described by professional
standards, is to express an opinion about whether the financial statements prepared by management with
your oversight are fairly presented, in all material respects, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles. Our audit of the financial statements does not relieve you or management of your
responsibilities. Our responsibility is to plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable, but not absolute,
assurance that the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
As part of our audit, we considered the internal control of RTD. Such considerations were solely for the
purpose of determining our audit procedures and not to provide any assurance concerning such internal
control.
We are responsible for communicating significant matters related to the audit that are, in our professional
judgment, relevant to your responsibilities in overseeing the financial reporting process. However, we are
not required to design procedures specifically to identify such matters.
Our audit of RTD’s financial statements has also been conducted in accordance with Government Auditing
Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. Under Government Auditing Standards,
we are obligated to communicate certain matters that come to our attention related to our audit to those
responsible for the governance of RTD, including compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations,
contracts, and grant agreements; certain instances of error or fraud; illegal acts applicable to government
agencies; and significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. Toward this end,
we issued a separate letter dated May 27, 2025 regarding our consideration of RTD’s internal control over
financial reporting and on our tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts,
and grant agreements.
Planned Scope and Timing of the Audit
We performed the audit according to the planned scope and timing previously communicated to you in our
meeting about planning matters on February 13, 2025.
Significant Audit Findings
Qualitative Aspects of Accounting Practices
Management is responsible for the selection and use of appropriate accounting policies. In accordance with
the terms of our engagement letter, we will advise management about the appropriateness of accounting
policies and their application. The significant accounting policies used by RTD are described in Note A to
the financial statements.
No new accounting policies were adopted, and the application of existing policies was not changed during
2024, except for the adoption of GASB 101, Compensated Absences.
We noted no transactions entered into by RTD during the year for which there is a lack of authoritative
guidance or consensus.
There are no significant transactions that have been recognized in the financial statements in a different
period than when the transaction occurred.
Accounting estimates are an integral part of the financial statements prepared by management and are
based on management’s knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about
future events. Certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to the
financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting them may differ significantly
from those expected.

Packet Pg. 265

Section I - Required Communications with Those Charged with Governance
(Continued)
The most sensitive estimate affecting the financial statements was the estimate of net pension liabilities,
which include significant assumptions related to life expectancies, future salary increases, and future rates
of return on investments. Management’s estimate of the net pension liabilities is based on actual valuations.
We evaluated the key factors and assumptions used to develop the estimate in determining that it is
reasonable in relation to the financial statements taken as a whole.
The disclosures in the financial statements are neutral, consistent, and clear.
Difficulties Encountered in Performing the Audit
We encountered no significant difficulties in performing and completing our audit.
Disagreements with Management
For the purpose of this letter, professional standards define a disagreement with management as a financial
accounting, reporting, or auditing matter, whether or not resolved to our satisfaction, that could be significant
to the financial statements or the auditor’s report. We are pleased to report that no such disagreements
arose during the course of our audit.
Corrected and Uncorrected Misstatements
Professional standards require us to accumulate all known and likely misstatements identified during the
audit, other than those that are trivial, and communicate them to the appropriate level of management. We
did not detect any misstatements as a result of audit procedures.
Management has passed on including the annual money-weighted rate of return schedule in the RSI of the
financial statements related to the Salaried Pension Plan. Management has determined that its effects are
immaterial, both individually and in the aggregate, to the financial statements taken as a whole. However,
uncorrected misstatements or matters underlying those uncorrected misstatements could potentially cause
future period financial statements to be materially misstated.
Significant Findings or Issues
We generally discuss a variety of matters, including the application of accounting principles and auditing
standards, business conditions affecting RTD, and business plans and strategies that may affect the risks
of material misstatement, with management each year prior to our retention as RTD’s auditors. However,
these discussions occurred in the normal course of our professional relationship, and our responses were
not a condition of our retention.
Management Representations
We have requested certain representations from management that are included in the management
representation letter dated May 27, 2025.
Management Consultations with Other Independent Accountants
In some cases, management may decide to consult with other accountants about auditing and accounting
matters, similar to obtaining a second opinion on certain situations. If a consultation involves application of
an accounting principle to RTD’s financial statements or a determination of the type of auditor’s opinion that
may be expressed on those statements, our professional standards require the consulting accountant to
check with us to determine that the consultant has all the relevant facts. To our knowledge, there were no
such consultations with other accountants.

Other Information Included in Annual Reports
Our responsibility for other information included in annual reports does not extend beyond the financial
statements, and we do not express an opinion or any form of assurance on the other information. However,
we read the introductory and statistical sections of the Annual Comprehensive Financial Report, and
nothing came to our attention that caused us to believe that such information, or its manner of presentation,
is materially misstated or materially inconsistent with the information or manner of its presentation
appearing in the financial statements.

Other Recommendations
System Access: A best practice, as related to your information technology systems, would be to perform
a review of user access to those systems at least quarterly or, at a minimum, annually. This review should
be documented and maintained to ensure that users of the system are appropriate and have the appropriate
level of access assigned based on their job responsibilities, taking into consideration of segregation of
duties for internal control purposes.
Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)
Significant legislation was enacted in 2022 that has dramatically expanded the available tax credits, tax
incentives, and other funding opportunities related to the green energy sector. Several of these are built on
previously existing programs, but many are new and widely applicable. Additionally, new monetization
options expand the benefits of tax credits for qualifying activities to public sector organizations like the
District. The breadth of qualifying activities is significant, including, in most cases, the production of
electricity; production of solar, wind, and energy equipment; installation of energy-efficient upgrades to
businesses and homes; and the acquisition of electric vehicles (EVs) and charging equipment. We are
happy to discuss any questions or potential tax credit opportunities with you, and please also feel free to
visit our IRA tax credits articles and webinars at https://www.plantemoran.com/explore-our-thinking/areasof-focus/inflation-reduction-act-tax-credits.
Monitoring Lease, SBITA, and PPP Activity
GASB Statements No. 87, Leases; No. 96, Subscription-Based Information Technology Arrangements
(SBITAs); and No. 94, Public-Private and Public-Public Partnerships (PPP) and Availability Payment
Arrangements, were effective in fiscal years 2022 and 2023. Although significant analyses were performed
to determine the applicability of the new standards and record any necessary adjustments, we want to
stress the importance of implementing ongoing monitoring procedures over lease, SBITA, and PPP activity.
When the District enters into new leases, SBITAs, or PPPs; existing agreements are modified; or other
facts and circumstances change, consideration must be given to the impact those changes will have on
lease, SBITA, and PPP accounting. In order to do so, the District must ensure there is a process in place
to identify and appropriately account for new leases, SBITAs, or PPPs or changes to existing agreements
on an ongoing basis or at least at the end of each year.
Cybersecurity and Information Technology Controls
Cyberattacks are on the rise across the globe, and the cost of these attacks is ever increasing. Because of
these attacks, municipalities stand to lose their reputation, the ability to operate efficiently, and proprietary
information or assets. Communities potentially can also be subject to financial and legal liabilities. Managing
this issue is especially challenging because even a municipality with a highly mature cybersecurity risk
management program still has a residual risk that a material cybersecurity breach could occur and not be
detected in a timely manner. We understand that the technology department continues to monitor and
evaluate this risk, which are critical best practices. Additionally, periodic assessment of the system in order
to verify that the control environment is working as intended is a key part of measuring associated business
risk. We encourage administration and those charged with governance to work with the technology team
on this very important topic. If we can be of assistance in the process, we would be happy to do so.
OMB Revisions to the Uniform Guidance
In April 2024, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) released revisions for the Uniform Guidance
for federal grants and agreements, which are effective for fiscal year ends beginning on October 1, 2024
and after. The guidance clarifies the applicability of requirements and terminology and includes some
relaxation and clarification of certain requirements that required prior approval from federal regulators. A
few key changes include the following:


Increase the single audit threshold to $1 million from $750,000



Require the schedule of expenditures of federal awards (SEFA) to identify recipient of federal award
for audits that cover multiple recipients

Section II - Recommendations and Legislative and Informational Items



Increase the de minimis indirect cost rate from 10 percent to 15 percent, effective for grants received
on October 1, 2024 and after

The changes are included in more detail within the federal register at https://www.federalregister.gov/doc
uments/2024/04/22/2024-07496/guidance-for-federal-financial-assistance, and we are happy to discuss
these changes with you.
Capitalization Thresholds
The April 2024 Uniform Grants Guidance 2024 Revision described above resulted in the equipment
threshold increasing from $5,000 to $10,000. This threshold applies to the value of equipment that at the
end of the grant period may be retained, sold, or otherwise disposed of with no further responsibility to the
federal agency. In addition to considering this Uniform Guidance threshold related to federal grants
compliance, it may be a good time for the District to reevaluate the capitalization thresholds. We are happy
to assist you in thinking through considerations in evaluating these thresholds.
Other New Legislation
Upcoming Accounting Standards Requiring Preparation
We actively monitor new Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) standards and due process
documents and provide periodic updates to help you understand how the latest financial reporting
developments will impact the District. In addition to the summaries below and to stay up to date, Plante &
Moran, PLLC issues a biannual GASB accounting standard update. The most recent update and a link to
previous fall and spring updates are available here.
GASB Statement No. 102 - Certain Risk Disclosures
This new accounting pronouncement will be effective for fiscal years ending June 30, 2025 and after. This
statement requires a government to assess whether a concentration or constraint makes the primary
government or other reporting units that report a liability for revenue debt vulnerable to the risk of a
substantial impact. It also requires a government to assess whether an event or events associated with a
concentration or constraint that could cause the substantial impact have occurred, have begun to occur, or
are more likely than not to begin to occur within 12 months of the date the financial statements are issued.
If certain criteria are met for a concentration or constraint, disclosures are required in the notes to the
financial statements.
GASB Statement No. 103 - Financial Reporting Model Improvements
This new accounting pronouncement will be effective for fiscal years ending June 30, 2026 and after. This
statement establishes new accounting and financial reporting requirements, or modifies existing
requirements, related to the following: management’s discussion and analysis; unusual or infrequent items;
presentation of the proprietary fund statement of revenue, expenses, and changes in fund net position;
information about major component units in basic financial statements; budgetary comparison information;
and financial trends information in the statistical section.
GASB Statement No. 104 - Disclosure of Certain Capital Assets
This new accounting pronouncement requires certain types of capital assets, such as lease assets,
intangible right-to-use assets, subscription assets, and other intangible assets, to be disclosed separately
by major class of underlying asset in the capital assets note. The statement also requires additional
disclosures for capital assets held for sale.

Significant GASB Proposal Worth Watching
The Revenue and Expense Recognition project aims to develop a comprehensive accounting and financial
reporting model for transactions that result in revenue and expenses. The GASB has issued a preliminary
views document that proposes a new categorization framework that replaces the exchange/nonexchange
transaction notion with a four-step categorization process for classifying a transaction. In addition to this
new framework, the proposal also addresses recognition and measurement of revenue and expense
transactions. The exposure draft for this project is expected sometime in 2025.
Plante & Moran, PLLC has spent significant time digesting this new proposed standard and recently testified
to the GASB about our feedback. We strongly encourage the District to monitor developments with this
standard, as the potential impact is quite broad.
