Recommended Actions


2012 Salaried Benefit Plan

Minutes of the Financial Administration and Audit Committee Meeting held on October 18, 2011
Page 2 of 6

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board
approve the 2012 Plan Year Salaried Insured Benefits Budget and authorizes the General
Manager to enter into an agreement with the Insurance Carriers.
Carla Perez explained that open enrollment for salaried staff will begin November 7,
2011. The goals for the 2012 plan are to achieve the 2012 Budget, continued focus on
containing cost and emphasis on improving health and wellness consumerism and
maintain market competitiveness.
Director Tobiassen inquired if the PTO plan could become a liability in the future. Cheryl
Sprague indicated that the net effect will result in a reduction of overall costs or
obligations to the district because of the overall reductions in accruals for sick leave.
Motion:

Director Tobiassen made the motion
to forward this item to the full Board
at the October 25, 2011 Board
Meeting.

Second:

Director Daly seconded the motion.

Vote on
Motion:

The Motion passed Unanimously.

 Drug and Alcohol Policy
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD
Board of Directors approve the revised RTD Drug and Alcohol Policy mandated by the
Federal Transit Administration of the United States Department of Transportation.
Carla Perez explained that recently there have been changes in the federal regulations
and RTD is therefore required to revise the policy and define provisions to comply with
current US Department of Transportation and Federal Transit Administration
requirements.
Motion:

Director Malpiede made the motion
to forward this item to the full Board
at the October 25, 2011 Board

 Certification of Contribution Rate for the RTD Defined Contribution Plan - 2012
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD
Board of Directors certifies a 2012 contribution rate to RTD’s Salaried Employees
Defined Contribution Plan of 9% of each participant’s eligible compensation.
Terry Howerter noted that this is brought to the Board annually. This action would
continue past practice of funding the defined contribution plan at the same level and rate
as the Defined Benefit Plan for those employees hired before January 1, 2008. The
Board has the option to certify at a level below 9%, but at this point staff is
recommending passing this action item at the 9% level.
Director Tayer inquired what the concern would be between the 9% plan and the 7%
plan (as an example) besides parity.
Terry Howerter explained that the plans are distinctly different and under the Defined
Benefit plan, all of the employees in that plan are guaranteed 2.5% of their 3 year
average before retirement. In the Defined Contribution Plan the employees are given the
same 9% but the employees must run their own investments and run the risk of any gain
or loss. Parity would be the biggest factor for keeping these two plans at the same
contribution level. Director Tayer added that the different employee groups could feel
they are being undercut if the contribution levels were not equal.
Motion:

Director Malpiede made the motion
to forward this item to the full Board
at the October 25, 2011 Board
Meeting.

Second:

Director Tobiassen seconded the
motion.

Motion:

The Motion passed Unanimously.
Chair

Director O’Boyle asked that this
item be moved to Recommended
Action for the Board Meeting.

 Proposed 2012 Fiscal Policy Statement
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board

Minutes of the Financial Administration and Audit Committee Meeting held on October 18, 2011
Page 4 of 6

of Directors accept the modifications to the Fiscal Policy Statement for 2012.
Terry Howerter indicated that this action will incorporate the Fiscal Sustainability Task
Force Recommendations in the Fiscal Policies. In February of 2011 all of the Fiscal
Policies were reviewed and this document primarily changes our Transit Development
Reserve and our Operating Reserve Requirement to a Fund Balance Presentation as
recommended by the Task Force.
Chair Pro Tem O’Boyle indicated perhaps the language should be changed to not include
the bullet point of maintaining or increasing ridership and fare revenues. Increasing
ridership is not always in our best interest.
Director Tayer added that our goal should be to increase ridership, but that we should
not provide service that is inefficient. We do not want to extend our resources beyond
what we can sustain.
Motion:

Director Tayer made the motion to
forward this item to the full Board at
the October 25, 2011 Board
Meeting.

Second:

Director Tobiassen seconded the
motion.

Vote on
Motion:

The Motion passed Unanimously.

 Budget Transfer for MOW Facility at Rio Court
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD
Board of Directors authorize the transfer of $2,426,451 for the Maintenance of Way
facility at Rio Court, Denver. The source of funds includes the 16th Street Mall Paver
expense project and the District Shops CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) capital project.
The transfer will provide funding for the award of a construction contract to rehabilitate
the recently acquired Rio Court facility.
Terry Howerter explained that RTD acquired the Rio Court facility as part of the West
Corridor Burnham yard CML railroad relocation. The Facility will be restored to working
condition and converted to house the Maintenance of Way operations and equipment
that will be needed with the expansion of light rail corridors. In order to continue the
work and fund the project we are requesting the Board to move $1,000,000 from the
16th Street Mall Paver Project which came in below budget and $1,426,000 from the
District Shop CNG Capital Project.
Director Daly asked if this means that we backing off from CNG. Terry Howerter

Minutes of the Financial Administration and Audit Committee Meeting held on October 18, 2011

explained that it does not. All this means is that we were looking to put in CNG safety
devices at district shops. We will continue that project at a later time. The Platte CNG
program will continue.
Motion:
Director Tobiassen made the motion
to forward this item to the full Board
at the October 25, 2011 Board
Meeting.

Information
 2012 Budget Update
Terry Howerter explained that we will ask the Board to adopt the 2012 Budget next
month. The Requested Budget is being built on the guidance of the 2011 adopted
SBP.
Jeanette Scarpino noted that the power point presentation summarized the revised
assumptions incorporated into the 2012 Requested Budget for the Base System and
the resulting changes from the previously approved 2012 Strategic Budget Plan.
 Sales/use taxes have been revised downward based on an updated
CU-Leeds School Forecast. Projected sales/use tax growth rate for
2012 is revised from 5.7% to 3.9% for a negative impact of $7.3
million.
 Operating expense is $373.4 million, down from $375.6 million for a
positive impact of $2.3 million.
 Diesel fuel is budgeted at $3.25/gallon prior for a negative impact of
$3.7 million.
 Investment income is revised downward to $500,000 from $2.3
million for a negative impact of $1.8 million.
The expected financial impact of these and other less significant changes to the
2012 unrestricted year end fund balance in the SBP is a negative $7.5 million, with
the downward revision in the sales/use tax forecast accounting for the majority of
the impact.
 August 2011 Monthly Financial Status Report
Doug MacLeod noted that everything was in green for the month of August, and
ridership was up. Fare revenue continues where it is expected to be, and sales and
use tax had a good month in August.

Other Matters
Chair Kemp indicated that he wanted to inform the Board that Director Riley had formally
resigned from the Board and his seat for District K will be up for appointment. Paula
Perdue will work with the legal department in sending a letter to the Adams County
Commissioner to get this moving forward and we will work diligently to get an
appointment made as soon as possible. Also, there will be an article in the Denver Post
regarding Mr. Riley. Contents of the article are not known at this time, but the Board
should be aware.
Committee Chair Pro Tem O’Boyle added that he regrets the circumstances in which Mr.
Riley resigned, but we wish him well in his future endeavors.
Scott Reed added that we will be sending out a press release announcing that the Board
had been informed by Mr. Riley that he is resigning and we were going to note the
reasons as stated by Director Riley in his email for his departure and that Adams County
would be the appointing authority.
