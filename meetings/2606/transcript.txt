Discussion:

Jannette Scarpino, Senior Manager of Budget and Financial
Analysis, presented the highlights of the 2017 amended
budget. She said the 2017 adopted budget was approved in
November 2016 and that changes are incorporated into the
adopted budget mid-fiscal year. She said the 2018 budget
would begin to roll out in August 2017 for the Board’s review.
She said the Board Report summarized appropriations for the
base system, FasTracks project, and FasTracks operations, as
well as combined appropriations on a district-wide basis. She
said overall the district-wide appropriation would decrease
$106 million from the adopted budget, which was derived
from a $143 million decrease to the capital project
carryforward, offset by a $36 million increase to the remaining
appropriation, which is mainly operating expenses. She stated
the report also showed district revenue sources and increased
operating expenses, due in part to a $1 increase in wages for
operators and workers’ compensation and in part to a $19.5
million increase from third-party funded betterments. She said
the combined capital budget would increase by $1.3 million,
$900,000 of which would go toward the base system and
$400,000 would go toward FasTracks expenses for the Gold
Line and the Southeast Rail Extension (SERE). She noted a
$143 million budget decrease in carryforwards attributable to
the advancement and completion of buildout projects,
including the Civic Center Station rebuild, the purchase of
buses and shuttles, and FasTracks projects. As for revenue,
she said the budget included a combined decrease of $80
million, due to lower than anticipated sales and use tax, fare,
and grant revenues. She stated the sales and use tax growth
would be 4% over 2016, down from the 8% growth rate
estimated in the 2017 adopted budget, a difference of $22
million. She said grant revenue would be down $50 million but
would be offset by an increase in contributed capital on the
FasTracks side of $110 million. She said the fare revenue
would decrease by $8 million due to changes in a fare revenue
model. She indicated the unrestricted fund balance would be
$24 million, an increase of $10 million from the adopted
budget due to a release of TABOR reserves in exchange for
the use of the Mariposa building as collateral. She indicated
the Board-appropriated fund and capital replacement fund
would each increase by $1.6 million.
Director Lubow asked General Manager Genova to discuss the
$1 increase in wages included in the budget.

General Manager Genova said the wage increase would apply
to both bus and light rail operators. He said the agency is still
struggling to hire and retain operators even though the hiring
numbers are up.
Director Lubow asked how the $1 wage increase was decided
upon.
General Manager Genova said that the agency reviewed the
entry level wages, the prevailing market, and the overall
unemployment rate and said the increase was merely an effort
to bolster retention and recruitment. He said the $1 increase
was a starting place and also noted that shift differentials have
been put in place, as well as referral and retention bonuses. He
said some details would have to be worked out with union
leadership.
Director Lubow asked Rolf Asphaug, General Counsel, to
speak to the $2 million increase budgeted for FasTracks
litigation.
Mr. Asphaug said the increase was due to increased claims
from Denver Transit Partners (DTP) for force majeure and
change in law claims, as well as dispute resolution litigation
with Regional Rail Partners (RRP) on the North Metro line.
Director Lubow asked about some of the budgeted figures
regarding the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) and
the estimated reserves going forward.
Ms. McKillop said she would discuss the numbers with
Director Lubow in person.
Director Broom asked whether a full year of service was
budgeted for the G Line in the 2017 budget and what impact
the delay of the opening has had.
Ms. McKillop said a full year of service was originally
accounted for in the draft 2017 budget but was removed in
the adopted budget.
Director Broom said the changes in the G Line operations were
not reflected in the amended budget.
Ms. McKillop confirmed that was her understanding.

Director Menten said there had been some movement with the
marketing dollars budgeted.
Ms. McKillop confirmed that the funds for the grand opening
of the G Line were included in the amended budget but none
of the operating dollars had been included.
Director Folska said the operators deserved the $1 increase
and asked why the General Manager thought that the increase
would help improve retention.
General Manager Genova said many factors influence retention
including working hours, lengths of shifts, and working
conditions. He said the agency is looking at reducing the
length of time between split shifts and whether doing so
would require changes in scheduling or additional operators.
Director Folska said the number one factor affecting retention
according to the drivers she has asked is the challenges of a
rude public. She said the operators should have more training
and support in that area.
General Manager Genova said that was an area in which
operators do receive support but would continue to look into
other options.
Director Folska said that she and Director Francone had
approached the members of Colorado’s Congressional
Delegation during the recent Accelerate Colorado event held in
Washington, D.C., to ask them to support the refund of $29
million from federal Railroad Rehabilitation & Improvement
Financing (RRIF) loans due to early repayment. She said
Congressman Polis asked her what the money would be used
for, and she said it would go to the Northwest Rail.
Ms. McKillop said the money came out of FasTracks and
would go back into FasTracks but that RTD would receive only
about half of that amount.
Director Mihalik asked about the additional $1.2 million
budgeted for workers’ compensation.
Mr. Asphaug said that the increase was not due to a general
overall increase in workers’ compensation payments. He said

RTD is self-insured and tries to keep its budgeted workers’
compensation figure close to the realized amount, but even a
few large claims can significantly impact that amount. He said
it is not unusual to see either an increase or decrease come up
during the amended budget process arising from claims during
the course of the fiscal year.
Director Tisdale asked about a $2 million increase budgeted
for workers’ compensation elsewhere in the budget and
whether the $1.2 million was part of that $2 million figure.
Mr. Asphaug said those two figures were completely separate
and that the $1.2 million was for additional payouts and the
$2 million was budgeted for additional outside litigation
resources.
Director Menten asked whether the $400,000 budgeted for
train wrap repairs was related to hail damage.
Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager of Communications,
said that the $400,000 was for replacement of train wraps
due to general wear and tear.
Director Menten asked for clarification about the refund of
Taxpayers’ Bill of Rights (TABOR) reserves using the Mariposa
building as collateral.
Ms. McKillop said that cash in the TABOR reserve can almost
never be spent, so the fair market value of building itself
would be swapped as collateral to free up the cash reserve.
Director Menten said she would prefer to see the TABOR
reserve stay as a cash amount rather than a building.
Ms. McKillop offered that there are still cash reserves in both
the base system and FasTracks budget for TABOR purposes.
She said that it is unlikely that the agency would ever be able
to use TABOR cash reserves. She said neither the state nor
any municipality has ever been able to access its TABOR
reserves. In her opinion, she said the agency has a good mix
of cash and other assets.
Director Solano said that he often hears complaints from
operators regarding split shifts and asked for an explanation of
the justification for split shifts.

General Manager Genova said that split shifts are common in
the transit industry and that the alternative would require
many more employees to cover the service hours. He said the
agency realizes operator positions are difficult in a lot of ways
and that the operators would like to see changes to the split
shift arrangement. He stated the agency is looking at schedule
cutting and runcutting options to shorten the duration of the
split and whether doing so would create additional
considerations.
Director Solano said that narrowing the split shift window
would not allow operators to go home between shifts and
would create more stress. He said he had heard drivers would
prefer to work longer shifts.
General Manager Genova said that operators are restricted in
how many hours they can work in any shift and in any given
work week. He reiterated that the agency is looking at many
different variables to see how improvements can be made for
operators.
Director Tisdale said that, with respect to the TABOR reserve,
the term “rainy day fund” is a misnomer, because it does not
operate as such, and in fact can only be used in dire
circumstances.
Ms. McKillop confirmed that she is not aware of any entity
that has ever been authorized to use its TABOR reserve.
Committee Chair Menten declared the motion PASSED.

• Approval of Contract Modification to increase contract authority for Infax,
Inc.
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee
that the Board of Directors authorizes the General Manager or his
designee to execute all documents necessary to increase the contract

authority amount with Infax, Inc. (Contract Number 15FH003) from the
current level of $1,788,655.39 by $825,000.00 to new total contract
amount of $2,613,655.39.
Motion:

Director Tisdale made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the June 27, 2017
Board Meeting.
Director Williams seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Kim Heldman, Senior Manager of Information Technology,
discussed programmable information displays (PIDs). She said
the current system was deployed across the district in 2011
and has been working well, but the displays have aged and the
agency has new operations and information requirements,
such as real-time information. She said RTD has been working
with the vendor, Infax, and the first phase has been
completed, with new displays having been installed at Union
Station, Oak Station, and US 36. She said the recommended
action would allow for the expansion of the displays to Civic
Center Station, the replacement of displays at 48 light rail
platforms, the purchase of computer hardware to operate the
displays, and maintenance, installation, and support. She said
that most of the funding came from grants and that the
recommended action would authorize an increase in the
contract amount, which would allow the expenditure of those
grant funds.
Director Folska asked if the displays were also audible.
Ms. Heldman said that the new displays are audible and that
some were already operational.
Director Folska asked whether the 48 platforms that are part
of the contract would be outfitted with audible displays, and
Ms. Heldman confirmed that they would be.
Director Broom asked whether the information scroll across
the PIDs is automated and whether it is possible to update the
displays manually to display critical information.
Ms. Heldman said the information display is automated and is
uploaded to the displays by the planning department. She
confirmed there is a mechanism to manually override the
information display.

Director Tisdale applauded the update because currently the
PIDs only show the scheduling information, rather than realtime information.
Committee Chair Menten declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

• Approval to enter into a contract with Mosaic 451 for Manager Security
Services
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee
that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his
designee to enter into contract negotiations with Mosaic451, LLC, a
Managed Security Services Provider (MSSP) to support of RTD’s
Information Technology (IT) systems security. The estimated cost of the
Managed Security Services contract of $1,901,235.00 includes roundthe-clock support for RTD’s boundary firewalls, security monitoring for
RTD’s most critical systems, and analysis of and response to security
incidents for a period of five years. Funding for this project is included in
the Cybersecurity Services budget for 2017 forward and was approved
during the 2016 Strategic Budget Process.
Motion:

Director Folska made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the June 27, 2017
Board Meeting.
Director Solano seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Sheri Le, Manager of Cybersecurity, said the recommended
action would allow RTD to enter into a contract with a
managed security services provider for round-the-clock support
for the agency’s four managed boundary firewalls and
monitoring of critical end-point systems, such as fare
collection systems. She said the company would monitor
those systems to ensure payment card industry (PCI)
compliance and the security of customers’ credit card data
and provide incident responses following suspicious activity.

Director Folska suggested that RTD should partner with
Colorado Technical University to provide potential employment
candidates in the field of information technology, particularly
cybersecurity.

Ms. Cohen also presented information on revenue growth projections, and
Ms. McKillop also reviewed the APE and SBP cashflow, which were
presented in similar spreadsheets.
Ms. McKillop noted that by 2020 the year-end APE would begin to
experience a balance shortfall, and by 2023 that shortfall is projected to
exceed $236 million. She stated that the finance department works to
resolve deficit, which amount accounts for projected requests versus
available funds. She said a similar process takes place for the SBP but the
Board does not typically see that process. She then identified the following
challenges identified in the APE and the next steps in the APE process:
APE Challenges
•

Completion of ongoing projects

•

Operating and maintenance cost of completed corridors

•

Sales and use tax volatility

•

Financing capacity and funding constraints

Director Folska asked staff to address the Northwest Longmont station.
Ms. Cohen said there was a $17 million commitment to the station in 2010,
which is still assumed in the APE. She said construction has been deferred
and is scheduled to be completed within the next two calendar years.
Director Folska asked where that $17 million is shown, and Ms. Cohen
responded that the funding is in the project totals.
Henry Stopplecamp, Assistant General Manager of Capital Programs, said
that the year of expenditure has been moved but the project is still
accounted for in the budget.
Director Folska asked whether the money physically exists somewhere, and
Mr. Stopplecamp confirmed that it does exist. She asked whether the money
would go toward the building of a commuter rail station, and Mr.
Stopplecamp responded that the money would be used to build a bus
transfer station that would also serve as the end of line for the Northwest
rail.
Director Folska then asked what would happen if the alignment for the rail
line to the station were to change.
Mr Stopplecamp said that the station would still be used for the bus routes
in that area, which may include the SH 119 bus rapid transit service. He said
that the station would no longer serve as the rail station if the alignment
were to change, but the construction would go forward in the short term to
allow for bus service.
Director Folska asked whether there was a conflict of interest in using
FasTracks dollars for a bus depot.
Mr. Stopplecamp reiterated that no conflict existed because the station
served as the end of line for the Northwest line.
Director Folska said that the station would not be the end of line if the
alignment were to change and that RTD has seen that happen.

Mr. Stopplecamp said that would be a policy decision for the Board. He said
that the people who would be serviced in the area were promised that RTD
would provide a facility and that the construction has been on the books for
10 years. He said the facility ties in with the environmental impact
statement for the Northwest rail.
Director Lubow asked about Denver Union Station Project Authority
(DUSPA) refinancing proceeds and when it would be possible to discuss
moving those funds into the FISA.
Ms. McKillop said the Board could direct staff to move those funds into FISA
during the next month’s meeting but stated that doing so would not be
staff’s recommendation.
Director Menten expressed her concerns over the budgeted costs for the
project closeout of FasTracks project, because the municipalities or other
entities are responsible for coming up with a matching portion of those
costs. She asked for an expected timeline for the closeout of projects,
because the APE has to be based upon those closeout dates. She asked who
oversees the collection of matching funds from the partnering municipalities.
Ms. McKillop said most of the matching contributions have been in-kind
contributions rather than cash contributions. She said some have been
significant cash contributions and would share those figures with the Board.
Director Menten asked if the Board, at the time the FasTracks measure was
approved in 2003, realized that the 2.5% contributions would be soft money
rather than cash contributions.
General Manager Genova said that the intergovernmental agreements (IGAs)
and Board Meeting minutes would need to be reviewed to find that answer.
Director Menten noted that the West Line corridor would soon be eligible to
receive grant funding despite the low ridership for the line and the fact that
the project was over budget.
Ms. Cohen said that the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) gives grants to
fixed guideway projects that have been open for seven years or longer for
capital maintenance, and the fixed guideway modernization grants are based
on the level of service provided and the mileage rather than for ridership.

• SmartCard Project Update

Tonya Anderson, Manager of Electronic Fare Operations, presented
information on the MyRide card program, beginning with an update on the
retail point of sales. She said that Safeway stores went live on May 31,
2017, and had sold $2,000 in fare media at that time. She said Safeway
had included in their June 14 store circular a small ad to encourage refilling
MyRide cards at their 50 participating stores. She said equipment had been
deployed to King Soopers stores and that training was going well, with a
target go live date of July 1, 2017, for their 84 participating stores. She said
the pilot store has logged $1,700 in sales. She said the public portal
enhancement went live on May 24 and stated the program had logged over
$500,000 in sales, including the reloads and the stores and online. She said
the next phase is the remediation of PCI compliance for the web portal, with
an anticipated compliance time in the third or fourth quarter of 2017. Lastly,
she said that the the vendor, Conduent, has provided fans and protective
screens to potentially remedy faulty platform validators for which the
screens had previously gone blank under high heat. She said testing would
take place over the four hottest months to ensure that the solution is viable.

Ms. McKillop said that the pilot participants in the program spread news of
the program to others, and therefore the go-live date for the public was May
17 also and issued 1,200 MyRide cards to the general public within the first
few days. She noted that there was a problem during the first week that
caused RTD to temporarily suspend the system to prevent a potential breach
due to a payment form that was not anticipated and for which Conduent
was not prepared. She said that the system was down for 48 hours, despite
concerns that the public would be dissuaded from using the program, but
noted that the public began to purchase media again immediately after the
system was relaunched. She said the system has experienced no problems
since that time and has received generally positive feedback overall.

Director Folska said she was excited to see how much revenue will be
generated by the program and asked the location of the pilot King Soopers
store, which Ms. Anderson said was on Speer Blvd. Director Folska also
asked whether Mosaic 451 would monitor the system and prevent skimmers
being used on ticket vending machines (TVMs).

Ms. McKillop responded that Mosaic’s job is to make RTD’s overall system
more secure by monitoring logs across the entire system. She said it will
take months for Mosaic to be fully operational, and in the meantime a thirdparty vendor will be assisting RTD in automating the monitoring in the nearterm. Regarding skimmers, she said the treasury employees monitor the

TVMs frequently, because the skimmer technology is becoming more
sophisticated. She said that no skimmers had been reported recently.

Director Folska asked whether it would make sense to eventually phase out
TVMs.

Ms. McKillop said that one day that may be a possibility but said that the
agency would have to figure out alternate methods of payment.
Director Folska said it seems the agency spends a lot of money to be able to
collect money.
Director Williams asked about the length of the load time for adding fare
media to MyRide cards.
Ms. McKillop said that users experience a load time of 42-72 hours before
the media appears on the MyRide card when loading via the web portal due
to the type of system employed. She said that fares would be
instantaneously loaded at the retail stores and via RTD outlets.
Director Sisk said that he was disappointed that RTD had not made more of
a marketing push for the rollout of MyRide cards.
Ms. McKillop said that staff wanted to make sure the system was working
well before promoting it. She said that Nate Currey, Senior Manager of
Public Relations and Public Information, has been doing promotions and
press releases for Safeway’s go live rollout. She said he is anxious to begin
a more robust marketing push, and staff will begin to promote the system
more heavily now that they have confidence that the system works.
Director Sisk said that RTD is inundated with bad news. He said there is no
reason RTD should not be touting this project and sees the lack of publicity
as a missed opportunity.
Mr. Reed responded that the Safeway rollout had begun but noted that King
Soopers stores had not yet gone live. He said that King Soopers plans to
promote the MyRide cards in their July 4 circular, at which point RTD will
begin to promote the program more heavily as well.
Director Sisk said that he would like to see the MyRide card promoted more
heavily on social media as well, and Mr. Reed said that social media
coverage would be included in the marketing.

Chair Hoy said that he and Director Sisk would be involved in outreach with
Commuting Solutions and saw that event as an opportunity to promote the
program.
Ms. McKillop added that RTD staff is scheduled to engage in a program with
Denver students in mid-July that would be promoted by Mayor Hancock of
Denver. She said that event may be another opportunity.
Director Tisdale suggested changing the type of free ride coupons from a
single-use paper ticket to a MyRide card preloaded with a ride.
Director Menten asked about the 42-72 hour processing time and inquired
whether that was the fastest cards could be loaded via the portal.
Ms. McKillop said that time frame was the best that could be expected using
the technology employed. She said when the project was first conceived in
2009, the technology was sophisticated but that newer technology has
progressed greatly.

• Quarterly Performance Report
Ms. Scarpino presented a brief update on performance. She stated:
• Local system-wide on-time performance (OTP) of 86.7% is an
improvement over 2016 but not on goal;
• Regional system-wide OTP of 92.2 is stable but not on goal;
• Commuter rail OTP of 89.9% was slightly below the goal of 90%;
• ADA OTP was slightly below goal due to ongoing staffing issues.
She said that ridership was down 1% year-over-year but noted that the drop
was not surprising when looking at national trends. She said that bus
operator vacancies jumped in the first quarter due to usual factors.

• April 2017 Monthly Financial Status Report
Doug MacLeod, Controller, said that the figures shown in the status report
were relative to the adopted budget and that sales and use, ridership, and fare
revenues were all down from budget projections. He said that sales and use
tax revenues were down by 2.6% compared to projections, or about $4.7
million, and that ridership and fare revenue were each down by 9%. He said
that ridership continued to be flat compared to 2016 levels. He stated that,
while the agency experienced a $9.1 million shortfall in fare and sales and

use tax revenues in the first four months, that shortfall was offset by lower
than projected operating expenditures.
Director Menten said that previous status reports showed the W Line
ridership as a separate line but noted that a change was made to the
reporting within the last few months to show combined ridership of all light
rail lines.
Ms. McKillop explained that the report began to incorporate ridership figures
from the R Line and that all ridership numbers had been combined. She said
going forward the ridership numbers for separate lines would all be
combined under the FasTracks heading and would be difficult to show
separately for the purposes of the status report.
Director Menten said she would appreciate seeing a separate breakout report
showing ridership numbers, similar to the special services report.
