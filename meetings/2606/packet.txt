BACKGROUND
The purpose of this Board Report is to request an amendment to the 2017 Adopted Budget. This
amendment will account for capital carryforward adjustments from year-end 2016 to 2017. The
amendment also will detail other adjustments to the capital budget and adjustments to the operating and
administrative budget.
DISCUSSION
Overview of the 2017 Budget Amendment

Packet Pg. 6

1.B.1

The total proposed appropriation for the 2017 Amended Budget and the changes from the 2017
Adopted Budget are summarized in the first set of tables above.
2017 Operating Expense Adjustments
The operating and administrative expense portion of the proposed budget amendment reflects an
increase of $35.9 million from the 2017 Adopted Budget. This increase consists of $16.2 million on the
Base System, $19.5 million in FasTracks Project/Construction, and $0.2 million in FasTracks Operations.
Of the $16.2 million increase for the Base System, major elements are $1.8 million for a $1/hour
increase to operator wages plus fringes; $4.7 million to repair coping panels on light rail (offset by thirdparty revenue); $0.620 million for light rail station high block repairs; $1.2 million for additional worker’s
compensation insurance; $1.7 million for a new planning project for East Colfax (offset by grant
revenue); $0.250 million for digital signage at DUS; adjustments to expense project carry-forward; and
various capital to expense budget transfers. On the Base System, the true increase to operating
expenses is less than 1.0%.
For FasTracks Project, the $19.5 million increase consists primarily of $11.5 million in a water-line
betterment related to SERE (offset by third-party revenue); $1.3 million in additional expenses for the
Eagle project, R Line, and SERE project, including insurance claims and pnr improvements; $4.0 million
for North Metro betterment work (offset by third-party revenue); and $2.0 million in legal expenses for
FasTracks projects. For FasTracks Operations, the $0.2 million increase consists of Eagle project thirdparty betterments (offset by third-party revenue) and extension of marketing/events staff due to delayed
project opening.
Shown in detail on the attached Amendment A, major changes in Amended Budget operating expenses
(excluding previously approved transfers and expense project carry-forward) are summarized by
department below.
Base System
Bus Operations
 Net increase of $1.5 million in wages and fringes for $1/hour increase to operator wages

Debt Service
On the Base System, interest expense is expected to decrease by $2.3 million from the benefit of debt
refunding/refinancing in 2017. Debt principal payments will increase by $1.4 million per adjustments to
amortization schedules. Capitalized interest is expected to show no change. On FasTracks, interest
expense will decrease by $3.1 million due to the benefit of debt refunding/refinancing. Debt principal
payments will decline by $2.2 million per adjustments to amortization schedules. Capitalized interest is
expected to remain the same. No new financing will be issued in 2017 for either Base System or
FasTracks.
2017 New Capital
The new capital portion of the proposed amended budget reflects a net increase of $1.3 million over the
2017 Adopted Budget. These changes result from program changes that have occurred since the 2017
Budget was adopted, and include the following significant changes:
Base System

Packet Pg. 8

1.B.1

New capital changes for Base System result in a net increase of $0.9 million from the Adopted Budget.
Adjustments to new capital funding since the 2017 Adopted Budget include additional funding of $1.5
million via budget transfers for several projects including Downtown Track & Switches Replacement,
Aurora and Sheridan bike shelters, and the Colfax Avenue Transit Priority Project. These amounts are
offset by reductions in spending of $0.6 million for Property Survey Records and Cybersecurity. Please
see Attachment B for detail.
FasTracks
New capital changes to FasTracks result in a net increase of $0.4 million from the Adopted Budget.
This results from updated project schedules for current projects that changed the projected expenditures
in 2017, adjustments for grant funding, changes in cost estimates, and corrections to the Adopted
Budget. Additions to new capital funding since the 2017 Adopted Budget include $0.5 million in
additional expenses for the Gold Line, and $0.9 million in additional expenses for SERE. These amounts
are offset by a reduction in spending of $1.0 million to the Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility. Please
see Attachment B for detail and Program Capital attached.
Previously Approved Capital Carryforward Adjustments
For the 2017 Adopted Budget, year-to-date actual expenditures as of 9/30/16 were used to compute the
estimate of the carryforward. This methodology is used to accommodate the timing of the adoption of
the annual budget. For the 2017 Amended Budget, year-to-date actual expenditures as of 12/31/16
were used to compute the estimate of the carryforward. This takes into account expenditures that were
made in the last quarter of 2016.
Previously approved capital carryforward of $720.5 million is decreased by $143.5 million from the
2017 Adopted Budget to reflect fourth quarter 2016 actual expenditures, transfers to reclassify certain
capital projects as expense projects and vice versa, previously approved transfers, project scope
changes, and completion of projects. The Base System portion is a decrease of $35.8 million and the
FasTracks portion is a decrease of $107.7 million. Please see Attachment C for detail and Program
Capital attached.
Revenue Changes
In the Amended Budget, revenues are projected to decrease $79.7 million on a combined basis from the
2017 Adopted Budget.






Sales and Use Tax revenues are projected to decrease $22.2 million from the 2017 Adopted
Budget based on the CU-Leeds School March forecast. The 2017 Amended Budget incorporates
the baseline forecast of 4.0% over 2016 actual. The 2017 Adopted Budget used the CU-Leeds
September Baseline forecast which called for a 6.7% increase over the then projected 2016 level.
On a combined basis, grant revenues including operating grants, capital grants, capital
maintenance, FASTER grants, STAMPS and CMAQ grants are projected to decline $49.7 million
from amounts in the 2017 Adopted Budget. On the Base System, grant revenue is projected to
increase $2.4 million in capital maintenance, CMAQ funds for a regional BRT study, and various
FASTER grants. For FasTracks, grants are budgeted to decrease $52.0 million in various grants
for the Eagle project, offset by increases in SERE corridor grants and contributed capital.
Contributed capital (not shown in the table above) is projected to increase $110.4 million from
third-party betterments and project contributions.
Farebox revenue is budgeted to decrease $7.9 million on a combined basis from the 2017
Adopted Budget. For the Base System, fare revenue is budgeted $3.3 million lower due to

Packet Pg. 9

1.B.1



revised estimates over 2016 actuals. For FasTracks Operations, fare revenue is budgeted to
decline $4.6 million due to revised estimates and delay in planned new service in 2017. Of
projected fare revenue of $142.5 million, $114.2 million is attributed to the Base system and
$28.3 million is attributed to FasTracks. Fare revenue is adjusted downward in the Amended
Budget on the basis of a fare revenue model which is now being used to estimate and allocate
fare revenue between Base and FasTracks and within FasTracks service corridors, and which
takes into account ridership decline.
Other operating revenue will remain flat from the 2017 Adopted Budget.

Although the primary sources of operating revenue are budgeted to decline, other sources of funding are
anticipated to materialize to support the budgeted increase in operating expense. These include: 1)
reduction to interest expense and principal debt payments totaling $6.2 million, 2) third-party funding,
and 3) increase to the unrestricted fund from the release of $11.0 million in TABOR reserves in
exchange for providing the Mariposa facility as collateral. Regarding the latter, a similar arrangement
was executed in 2016 exchanging the Blake building as collateral for TABOR reserves in order to raise
funding. Capital expenditures (on-going and carry-forward) will be funded by previously issued debt
proceeds and previously identified project funding.

Unrestricted Year-End Fund Balance

The combined Unrestricted Year-End Fund Balance is projected to increase $9.6 million from the
Adopted Budget to $23.9 million reflecting the addition of $11.0 million in TABOR reserves described
above, net of amended budget revisions to both revenue and expenses, replenishment of BoardAppropriated fund, and increases per fund balance policy.
FasTracks Project Reserves
The proposed 2017 Amended Budget reflects maintenance of the FasTracks Management Reserve
(formerly contingency reserve) at a balance of $15.9 million. This reserve is appropriated annually, and
is used to fund any changes in the FasTracks schedule that could not be forecast at the time of adoption
of the annual budget. The purpose of this reserve is to allow the District to accommodate minor
changes to the FasTracks schedule without requiring frequent budget amendments to draw funds from
the FasTracks Construction Reserve. The FasTracks Construction Reserve is budgeted at $56.3 million.
These project reserve balances remain unchanged from the 2017 Adopted Budget.

Budget Transfers
The proposed 2017 Amended Budget reflects year-to-date budget transfers executed within the General
Manager’s authority or by prior authorization of the Board of Directors. The District’s budget transfer
policy was adopted by the Board of Directors on 2/26/85 and further amended on 1/1/93, 5/15/08 and
4/1/10. The policy states that cumulative transfers between projects in amounts exceeding $250,000
require prior approval of the Board of Directors.
Cost Recovery Ratio
The proposed 2017 Amended Budget meets the cost recovery ratio mandated by the Colorado General
Assembly. The estimated SB154 recovery ratio (all nontax revenue except ADA farebox revenues

Packet Pg. 10

1.B.1

divided by all expenditures, including depreciation, except ADA expenditures and expenditures incurred
for long-term planning and development of rapid transit infrastructure) exceeds the annual target of 30%
mandated by the General Assembly. The RTD operating revenue recovery ratio (operating revenues
except ADA farebox revenues divided by the same cost basis as the Colorado General Assembly) is
estimated to exceed the 20% target established by the Board of Directors.

Fund Balance Policy
The proposed 2017 Amended Budget includes a reserve of 3% of annual spending as defined in Article
X, Section 20 of the Colorado Constitution (the TABOR reserve). The proposed 2017 Amended Budget
maintains a Board-Appropriated Fund, Capital Replacement Fund, Unrestricted Year-End Fund, and
Unrestricted Operating Fund (Base System only) in the District's working capital. The objective is for the
total of these funds excluding the Capital Acquisition Fund to equal approximately three months of
operating expenses excluding depreciation for each of the District entities (Base System, FasTracks
Project and FasTracks Operations). On the Base System, this objective is not expected to be met in the
2017 Amended Budget.
Basis of Accounting and Budgeting
The accounts of the District are reported using the accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are
recognized when earned and expenses are recognized when incurred. The District’s basis of budgeting
follows the accrual basis of accounting except (1) capital outlays and payments of debt principal are
treated as expenditures, (2) asset sale proceeds and debt issuance proceeds are included, (3)
depreciation, gains and losses on disposal of property and equipment, and the non-cash portion of longterm unfunded pension accruals are excluded.

ALTERNATIVES
1. Amend the 2017 Adopted Budget to reflect the capital project changes and the adjustments to the
operating budget. This is the recommended action.
2. Request staff to revise the proposed amendments to the 2017 Adopted Budget and amend the
budget with revisions.
3. Do not amend the 2017 Adopted Budget. This is not recommended, because the 2017 Adopted
Budget does not reflect the capital carryforward adjustments, capital budget adjustments, and
material changes to the operating and administrative budget.

Subject:

Approval of Contract Modification to increase
contract authority for Infax, Inc.

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: June 14, 2017
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: June 27, 2017

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorizes the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to increase
the contract authority amount with Infax, Inc. (Contract Number 15FH003) from the current level of
$1,788,655.39 by $825,000.00 to new total contract amount of $2,613,655.39.
BACKGROUND
RTD uses Programmable Information Displays (PIDs) including monitors and light-emitting diode (LED)
signs, to provide riders information on travel status. RTD’s current system uses monitors at a number
of venues including Denver Union Station, Civic Center Station, Boulder Station, Boulder Junction at
Depot Square and the Denver International Airport (DIA). There are also LED signs throughout the
region and on most light rail platforms.
The displays provide scheduled departure information for RTD fixed route service and light rail. With
the advancement of Real-Time Passenger information, the new data will be extended into the PID’s
system.
The current system was deployed well over six-years ago and has functioned well with reasonable
reliability, however it is currently outdated with replacement parts becoming non-existent to obtain.
With the FasTrack expansion, a desire for additional functionality (e.g. real-time information) and the
importance of the customer service, a procurement was released in 2015 to extend, enhance and/or
replace in-kind, the system. The new equipment will also retain RTD compliance with the accessibility
requirements for all RTD customers.
DISCUSSION
RTD released a Request for Proposal (RFP) No. 15FH003, on May 20, 2015 to provide for a full range
of services and products related to RTD’s Programmable Information Display System (PIDs). The
contract has a 6% DBE participation requirement. A well-attended vendor briefing was held June 2,
2015. The proposal period closed June 26, 2015, two proposals were received and Infax was
subsequently selected and contracted.
The contract was structured with a series of options that supported operations and future needs. The
original contract authority was for $1,788,655.39, the first set of assignments are complete and
addressed: additional signage at DUS, full implementation at Boulder Junction at Depot Square, Oak

Packet Pg. 32

1.B.2

Street Station, and US 36. These projects were primarily funded by a federal grant.
Subsequently there have been additional sign projects needed including replacement of the PIDs at the
new Civic Center Station (CCS) and additional hardware and software to fully upgrade 48 Light
Rail platforms and back office servers and workstations. This additional contract authority will allow
these projects to proceed. This also provides for the maintenance and support for the ongoing
operations of the new equipment.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
This contract authority increase is to provide for planned projects including, integration of real-time
information, and replacement of current light rail platform signage and hardware. Funding is through
existing grants, SBP and operational accounts.
ALTERNATIVES


Authorize the General Manager or his designee to increase the Infax contract not-to-exceed
amount by $825,000 to a new contract amount not to exceed $2,613,655.39. This is the
recommended action



Continue to provide remedial repairs to extend the system life. This is not a sustainable
option.
Proceed with an entirely new procurement. This would take well over a year to procure and
deploy the chosen system.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

From:

Heather McKillop,
Administration

Date:

June 14, 2017

Subject:

Approval to enter into a contract with Mosaic
451 for Manager Security Services

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: June 14, 2017
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: June 27, 2017

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to enter into contract negotiations with Mosaic451,
LLC, a Managed Security Services Provider (MSSP) to support of RTD’s Information Technology (IT)
systems security. The estimated cost of the Managed Security Services contract of $1,901,235.00
includes round-the-clock support for RTD’s boundary firewalls, security monitoring for RTD’s most
critical systems, and analysis of and response to security incidents for a period of five years. Funding
for this project is included in the Cybersecurity Services budget for 2017 forward and was approved
during the 2016 Strategic Budget Process.
BACKGROUND
Cybersecurity is a necessary part – and one of IT’s key contributions – to RTD’s safety mission.
Detecting threats before they become damaging to RTD or RTD’s customers is a key part of the
cybersecurity mission and one of the five primary elements of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.
Robust, mature services that provide real-time threat data, like 24x7 system monitoring, require staff
dedicated to the monitoring and response processes supported by log analysis technologies. RTD’s
current monitoring strategies are reactive, patchy (only apply to certain systems), and driven only by
significant events, leaving RTD vulnerable to most cyberattacks which are designed to escape
immediate attention and impacting RTD’s ability to comply with regulatory requirements such as the
Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS). With competing demands for growth, RTD
IT has neither the cybersecurity staff nor the technologies on board to support this important process
internally.
In addition to the above, the number and complexity of boundary firewalls protecting the District
from outside attack grew significantly in 2016. Historically, less than half of one staff member’s time
has been dedicated to monitoring, maintaining, and managing one firewall, which moderated RTD’s
primary connection to the Internet. When three additional, advanced firewalls were added in 2016, it
soon became clear that a partial staff member is not nearly enough staff time to perform the
necessary cleanup, maintenance, and configuration, nor for the staff member to maintain focus or
develop the experience required for RTD to benefit from the security features included in the new
firewalls.
There are significant advantages to RTD in choosing Mosaic451 to provide Managed Security
Services, including:
 Immediate visibility to, analysis of, and if needed, response to security events impacting
RTD’s monitored systems and networks, 24x7, every day of the year;
 Alleviates staff bottleneck within IT department regarding firewall support, and instead moves
RTD to a 24x7 support model, allowing us to use technology experts to streamline the device

Packet Pg. 34

1.B.3

configuration, resolve critical connectivity issues and make adjustments to respond to security
events in a timely manner, day or night;
 Satisfies Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) requirements (Section 10)
for system monitoring and analysis;
 Direct personal contact with the provider’s Security Operations Center through a dedicated
onsite support contact that acts as a member of the RTD cybersecurity team;
 Allows RTD’s internal resources to focus on the direction, development, and implementation
of RTD’s enterprise-wide cybersecurity program, policies, and procedure- and system-level
improvements, vs. constantly reacting to incidents;
 RTD owns and retains all of the source data and systems used to gather data for monitoring
on premises, so that it is available in the event RTD needs or wants to discontinue services or
switch service providers;
 Significant cost savings over building our own internal Security Operations Center (i.e.
establishing workspace, hiring additional staff, and implementing monitoring technologies)
 Shorter time to develop and deliver the necessary monitoring and support capabilities by using
trained resources that operate to standard procedures.
Mosaic451 will help RTD to more quickly and effectively detect, contain, and eradicate threats to
RTD’s service availability, financial security, and passenger and staff safety using a constantly
available staff of trained security professionals. Mosaic451 will work side-by-side with RTD’s
cybersecurity team to ensure their efforts align with RTD’s agency-wide, IT, and cybersecurity
objectives and bring tangible value to RTD.
DISCUSSION
The intent of the Managed Security Services contract is to accelerate RTD’s development of
proactive security monitoring and incident response capabilities in order to support RTD’s
cybersecurity and regulatory compliance posture. Acquiring a service provider lets RTD take
advantage of specialized, always available, external expertise with significant savings to the agency
in cost and time.
Following RTD’s Procurement process, the Information Technology department issued a Request for
Proposal to identify a qualified MSSP. A selection committee evaluated and identified the best
candidate, Mosaic451, to meet RTD’s needs. The proposed partnership would allow RTD to retain
Mosaic451 for an initial period of two (2) years with an option to extend services for three (3)
individual years, for a total potential contract period of five (5) years. Additionally, Mosaic451 has
offered that should RTD not be happy with the services provided within the first six (6) months of
the contract, RTD may terminate the contract without further obligation.
The requested funds include:
 Services initiation;
 24x7 support for four (4) advanced boundary firewalls and two (2) web application
firewalls/load balancers;
 24x7 monitoring and incident response support for 40 endpoint devices (ex. servers),
expandable (by option, if exercised) up to 100 critical devices;
 An onsite member of the Security Operations Center to collaborate with RTD on daily
projects, incidents, and reporting.
RTD’s cybersecurity team will collaborate with Mosaic451 to define the systems, business rules for
monitoring, and response procedures that work best for RTD. The initial proposed monitoring scope
includes the managed firewalls and the payment card processing environment.

Packet Pg. 35

1.B.3

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The total estimated cost of the Managed Security Services Contract, with options, is $1,901,235.00.
This amount bridges the five (5) year potential contract period. The base cost of $770,715.00 includes
an annually recurring service cost of $376,840.00 for two consecutive years plus $17,035.00 in onetime start-up charges within the first year (2017). All base expenses (for 2017 and 2018) were
budgeted and approved for this purpose via the 2016 and 2017 Strategic Budget Planning process.
Optional future years’ operating expenses were entered into the Strategic Budget Plan for 2018 forward
as projected costs and will be updated as appropriate.
Any additional funding necessary to implement hardware or software improvements required to facilitate
the services are separately budgeted in the appropriate category (capital or expense) for 2017 forward.
ALTERNATIVES
The available alternatives include:
 Approve the contract with Mosaic451. This is the recommended action to accelerate RTD’s
ability to perform proactive monitoring and incident response and meet compliance and
security objectives.
 Establish an internal Security Operations Center. At least four (4) immediate full-time
employees; a 24x7 workspace with enhanced systems visibility (ex. large displays);
acquisition of security log monitoring software; implementation, testing, tuning, and training
on the monitoring software; and the rapid growth of monitoring procedures and expertise will
be required to provide internal services equivalent to that which is offered by Mosaic451.
While it may be possible to hire staff and collaborate with RTD departments and our security
engineering contractors to develop such capabilities over time, this is not the recommended
action because it will take significantly longer to establish, is a significant cost investment,
and should we choose to change course and outsource the service later, may result in sunk
costs.
 Do not approve the contract with Mosaic451 and do not increase cybersecurity staffing (do
nothing). This is not the recommended action because the onboard staff is already
overburdened by the firewall management work and does not currently have the human
capacity to establish and perform the monitoring services.

Board Meeting Date:
Information

The Smart Card Program is an Electronic Fare Collection and Payment System designed to increase fare
payment convenience for our customers, reduce and optimize fare collection costs for the agency and reduce
fraud associated with paper based fare media. The contract was signed with Xerox Transport Solutions, Inc.
(now Conduent) in mid-2010. A smart card is a plastic card which customers load and reload RTD fare
products. There are currently 4 products; EcoPass, CollegePass, Neighborhood EcoPass and MyRide Stored
Value available on the smart card.
The Smart Card Program launched to EcoPass, CollegePass and Neighborhood EcoPass customers on January
1, 2013. There are approximately 475,000 active cards in circulation. During the month of May 2017, 1.3M
taps were recorded.
Starting the morning of January 4, 2016 MyRide Stored Value cards were dispersed to the public pilot program
participants at the RTD retail outlets. On Wednesday May 17, 2017, the MyRide portal went live to the pilot
participants and on May 24, 2017, the portal was launched to the general public. As of June 4, 2017,
approximately 2,880 cards were issued, of which 2,330 (81%) were full fare cards and 550 (19%) were
discount cards. The average stored value loaded (initial purchases and reloads) was $47.50, with a total
value loaded of $485,400. Customers took 139,400 trips using these MyRide cards with a fare payment value
of $393,300. Of these trips; 70% were local, 27% regional and 3% airport.
MyRide Stored Value Card is a product that can be purchased by the general public through the MyRide web
portal. Once the card is loaded, it can be used to board bus or rail until the dollar amount on the card is less
than the fare needed. Additional value can be loaded onto the card online, at RTD sales outlets and at Retail
outlets (Safeway and King Soopers). As of June 1, 2017, customers can load cash value onto MyRide cards at
50 Safeway retail stores.
All bus installations are complete for operational service. Additional validators will be installed as buses are
purchased.
Additional platform validators were installed for the University of Colorado A Line, B Line to Westminster and R
Line to Aurora. More platform validators will be installed on the G Line to Wheat Ridge. 191 Light and
Commuter Rail platform validators have been installed and are operational.
As of January 1, 2017, Xerox Transport Solutions, Inc. separated its Business Process Services Unit into an
independent public company called Conduent. Xerox will be referred to as Conduent.

POLICY REFERENCE
Fiscal Policy Statements – Budget Policy 10
DISCUSSION
Attached is the Performance Report for the First Quarter of 2017. These year-to-date measures
provide a framework in which RTD determines how well it provides service to its passengers and
the citizens of the District within its mission statement objectives. Of the 41 performance measures
tracked for the GM, RTD met 35 of the goals in the first quarter. The following is a discussion of
the exceptions.
Goal 3.1 – System-Wide On-Time Performance
The District as a whole did not meet its goals for on-time service in Q1, but overall performance is
improved over full-year 2016. System-wide Local on-time service at 86.7%, though not on goal,
was higher than 2016 at 85.3%. In Local on-time service, only First Transit-Denver met goal while
the remaining carriers did not. Regional on-time service at 92.2% did not meet goal but was stable
to 2016. Staff will continue its targeted efforts in studying the worst performing routes and
identifying the resources needed to improve such as service changes and operator training.
Overall Light Rail on-time service not only exceeded goal in Q1 but at 94.1% actually improved over
2016. Commuter Rail on-time service at 89.9% was nearly at goal of 90.0%.
Goal 5.1 – Improve ADA On-Time Performance
Staffing challenges continued to cause fluctuations in on-time performance in Q1.

Goal 6.2 – Increase Ridership
Ridership for the quarter was down 1.0% compared to same time prior year, which mirrored the
national trend.
Goal 6.5 – Bus Operator/Mechanic Headcount within Authorization
Bus operator vacancies exceeded goal in Q1 due to attrition, retirements, system growth, and the
strong local economy.
