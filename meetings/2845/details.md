#### 1. Budget Actions for T2  and O and M Cost Model

It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors approve a budget transfer of $3,057,000 from the Operating Reserve to the Planning expense budget to fully fund a contract award for the Transportation Transformation Comprehensive Plan (T2 Comp Plan).  The Board previously approved all funding for this contract last fall when they adopted the 2019-2024 Mid-Term Financial Plan, with the exception of the $1,420,000 DRCOG Regional Share TIP funding approved by the DRCOG Board in December 2018.  The funds are being temporarily taken out of the Operating Reserve due to a timing issue and will be replenished in the 2019 Amended Budget with a combination of the DRCOG grant funds received and local funds, which were programmed to be expended in 2020.

It is further recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors approve a budget transfer of $200,000 from the Operating Reserve to the Finance and Administration expense budget for development of an updated operating and maintenance cost model to support the T2 Comprehensive Plan effort.  The funds are being temporarily taken out of the Operating Reserve due to a timing issue and will be replenished in the 2019 Amended Budget with local funds for the T2 Comp Plan that had been approved by the Board last fall.

This action addresses four of the General Manager’s goals for 2019:

- Task Goal #4 – Address Future Transportation Needs and Methods
