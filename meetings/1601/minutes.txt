

Farebox Revenues system-wide were 8.5% higher in December 2006 than they
were in December 2005. The increase in farebox revenues can be primarily
attributed to the increase in ridership and the implementation of a fare increase for
local service from $1.25 to $1.50 on January 1, 2006.
Farebox Revenues were 14.8% higher than year-to-date 2005 Farebox Revenues,
and 3.6% higher than year-to-date projections.
