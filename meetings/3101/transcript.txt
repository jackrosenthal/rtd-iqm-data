RTD Special Board Meeting
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Good evening, everybody I will now call the Tuesday, June 16, Special
Board Meeting to order. We are convened as of 5:33 PM, Mountain Daylight. I would respectfully ask
everyone connected to this call to mute your phones and set your ringers on silent.
Please note that under current circumstances, the official meetings of the RTD Board of Directors are
being held remotely in the interest of public health, safety, and welfare during this time. Meetings will be
remotely audio recorded. The audio recordings, along with the unofficial minutes of the meetings will be
posted, as soon as practicable, to the board's website. Please visit www.rtd/denver.com and scroll to the
bottom of the page for the link to the Board of Directors page.
Directors and members of the staff, for the sake of the record, if you would like to be acknowledged
during tonight's proceedings, I would ask that you please announce your name and wait for me to call you
before proceeding to speak. Speaking out of turn will only add confusion to the record and to the
proceedings. Please note that at the appropriate time during our discussion and voting processes later on
this evening, I will call on each director in turn.
So please know that your time to speak will come. And if possible, please hold your comments until that
time. Ms. McManus, would you please call the roll?

KATE WILLIAMS: He's not here.

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK. Director Tisdale. Director Tisdale?

TROY WHITMORE: Present.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Williams.
KATE WILLIAMS: Good evening. I am here.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. And Chair is here. I know Director Tisdale was on the line, so
I'm thinking that he may have it either on mute or a technical issue. But I am going to go ahead and count
him in attendance, because he did sign in.
Director Mihalik is not in this evening. OK. So that means-BARBARA MCMANUS: I apologize, Chair. Maybe-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Oh, that's OK.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Maybe Director Tisdale got knocked off for some reason. I got knocked off the
call and had to dial back in.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK. Thank you. So I am showing 14-DOUG TISDALE: I can hear you, but you can't hear me.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Oh, there you are. Hello, Director Tisdale.
DOUG TISDALE: I was saying-- yeah, I can hear you, but you-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I did mark you down as present.
DOUG TISDALE: I appreciate that. Thank you, Madam Chair. Yes, I am present, and I've heard
everything you have said, but I guess you didn't hear what I said. And it didn't say mute, so-- in any event,
thank you, Madam Chair.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, sir. One more time, Director Mihalik? OK, hearing none. I have
14 present and one absent, being Director Mihalik.
At RTD, safety is our core value, and I'd like to begin this meeting with a short safety briefing. As cities
and states across the country begin to reopen, we are beginning to see a resurgence of COVID-19 virus
in some areas. As such, this information bears repeating if we are to remain vigilant in the weeks and the
months to come.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. Cover your cough or sneeze with a
tissue, and then throw the tissue in the trash. If you don't have a tissue, cough or sneeze into the upper
sleeve or elbow, not your hand.
Stay at home when you are feeling sick, self-monitor for flu-like symptoms, and consult with your doctor's
office via phone if necessary. Clean and disinfect frequently-touched surfaces, both at work and at home.
When soap and water aren't available, use hand sanitizer with a concentration of at least 60% alcohol.
Washing your hands is still one of the most effective ways to prevent the spread of the virus. Be sure to
lather each and every part of your hand, and scrub for at least 20 seconds. 30 is better. Wearing a mask
has also been shown to reduce the spread of the virus. RTD patrons are encouraged to wear masks
when using public transportation. For RTD employees, please refer to signage in your work areas, as well
as the recent letter from our Chief Safety Officer, Mike Meader, on the topic of mask use in the workplace.

And lastly, though cities and counties are beginning to relax their stay-at-home orders, for the safe and
the safety of others in our community, continue to avoid close exposure to those outside of your
household to the greatest extent possible. This includes practicing social distancing aboard buses and
trains, and around station stops and platforms. This evening, we have one recommended action on the
agenda.
It is A, approval of Accountability Committee Proposal. It is recommended by the Chair of the RTD Board
of Directors that the Board of Directors adopt the attached document entitled, in quotes, "RTD
Accountability Committee Proposal," end quote. This recommended action supports the following general
manager's goal.
Number 1 is the core goal. Number 2-- strong and ethical leadership. Core goal number 5-- effective
communications and community outreach. And task goal 1-- strengthen transparent public
communication and collaboration. Do we have a motion?
JUDY LUBOW: So move, Judy Lubow.
KATE WILLIAMS: So move, Director Williams.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK. i have Director Lubow as the movement and Director Williams as the
second. Is there any discussion? All right. Hearing that there is no discussion, I will now call for the vote.
SHONTEL LEWIS: I-- hey. This is Director-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I'm sorry?
SHONTEL LEWIS: This is Director Lewis.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Please, Director Lewis.
SHONTEL LEWIS: I had a question. It wasn't clear within how this was written around the Governor
making the appointments, and then the Transportation Chairs. And I thought we had originally talked
TLRC making those appointments, but this reads a bit different. And so I wondered if Lynn might talk a bit
about that, and if there's room for those appointees to be TLRC instead of individuals.
LYNN GUISSINGER: You know, actually-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Guissinger?
LYNN GUISSINGER: Hi. Thank you. I'm pretty sure the TLRC and the other interim committees have
been disbanded this year, or not carrying on. I could be wrong on that. I remember hearing that at some
point. But this has been the plan all along through here.
I can't remember exactly what the original language in SB 151 said. I think it-- oh, I do remember what it
was. It was spread out with various different people-- the House Minority Leader and the Senate Majority
Leader and various groups. But we've been working with the Governor's Office and House and Senate
Transportation Chairs. And I'm sure they'll be consulting with leadership, but this was what we ultimately
came to agreement on.
SHONTEL LEWIS: All right. Thank you.
LYNN GUISSINGER: And I shouldn't say, ultimately, this was the plan all along. This is how it developed.
Since I'm speaking, I'll go ahead and just say that I don't really feel the need to say much, since we've
talked about it a number of times. But this came out in SB 151.
We were able to move this part forward, rather than some later legislation to name a committee. We feel
like this is a good result, and it sounds like most of you feel that way, too. And I appreciate that. And we
just want to thank Senator Winter and Representative Gray and the Governor and his staff and

Brandeberry McKenna, Sherry-- everybody that had been involved with it for helping move it forward.
Thanks.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, Director Guissinger. Any other discussion?
CLAUDIA FOLKSA: Director Folska.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Go ahead, Director Folska.
CLAUDIA FOLKSA: Thank you, Chair. I was wondering if Director Guissinger could speak to whether or
not she was able to integrate accessibility not just externally to RTD-- that is, facilities and all the other
things that are in there. But also requiring internal accessibility, as well, in the agency.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. Director Guissinger?
LYNN GUISSINGER: Sure. We talked about this yesterday, and I tried to reach you today to talk about it.
I think I didn't try to change it today. We have agreement on all of this. But the scope of work says,
"including but not limited to," and I will commit to putting this forward with the committee and the parties
that are putting it together. It's a good suggestion.
CLAUDIA FOLKSA: Chair?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes, Director Folska?
CLAUDIA FOLKSA: Thank you. OK, that sounds wonderful, Director Guissinger. I think if we're really
sincere about what this ad hoc committee is intending to do, in particular, for accessibility, that the internal
workings of this institution are accessible as well, inside and out, up and down, enterprise-wide. That's all.
Thank you.
Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I would just like to-LYNN GUISSINGER: Thank you. Yeah.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I'd like to state for the record right now that Director Mihalik has joined us.
Welcome, Director Mihalik. All 15 board members are now on the call. Are there any other discussion
items with the proposal for the accountability? Hearing none, I will now call for the vote, and we'll proceed
in reverse alphabetical order. Director Williams.
KATE WILLIAMS: You have to give me a little more notice to do that. I vote yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Oh. [LAUGHS] Thank you. Director Whitmore.
TROY WHITMORE: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Walker.
JEFF WALKER: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Tisdale.
DOUG TISDALE: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Mihalik.
KEN MIHALIK: I'm a yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Menten.
NATALIE MENTEN: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Lubow.
JUDY LUBOW: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Lewis.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Guissinger.

LYNN GUISSINGER: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Folska.
CLAUDIA FOLKSA: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Cook.
SHELLEY COOK: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Catlin.
PEGGY CATLIN: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Buzek?
VINCE BUZEK: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Broom?
BOB BROOM: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: And myself, Chair Malpiede, yes. It's unanimous. Thank you so very much.
This was the only agenda item we had in our Special Board Meeting. We are also going to be having a
study session.
So before I conclude this, I just want to say thank you, and I look forward to the work that we'll be doing in
collaboration with the Governor's Office, the legislature-- I think that this is going to be a great experience
for all of us. So thank you so much. Before I close this meeting, does any director have any other matters
to discuss? Hearing none, I will call for the-SHONTEL LEWIS: I-- this is Director Lewis.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Oh. Go ahead, Director Lewis.
SHONTEL LEWIS: I'm sorry. Just because we are in a Special Board Meeting, I have to take the
opportunity to revisit the draft proposal that I send to each of you regarding the mental health
professionals' proposal in lieu of our contract-- our police contract. And really, I just wanted to underscore- we started this meeting out with talking about safety as being a core value.
And what I propose-- there's an opportunity to change the culture of safety, and not necessarily the
means, and really to figure out a way to create a more harmonious approach when someone is having a
bad day or is in crisis or is in need of support. And I know our street supervisors fill these roles currently.
And so I appreciate them for doing that.
And I just ask that several board members-- I've heard from some of you about your thoughts, and I thank
you in advance for that. But I hope, as a board, we commit to the principle of fairness and safety for all of
our patrons, because I know there are a number of patrons who don't feel safe when they see a gun and
a badge. And that's essentially what my proposal is.
And so I hope that I can get some support from many of you to be able to push this along forward,
because I don't think it's a tall order, but I do think it's a necessary one. And I do think it's the very least
we can do. So that is all.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, Director Lewis. OK. Any other matters?
KATE WILLIAMS: Madam-- Madam Chair?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes.
KATE WILLIAMS: Madam Chair?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes, Director Williams?

KATE WILLIAMS: Hi. Thanks so much. Yes. I just want to comment on something that I hear on a regular
basis, and I'd like to put out in public meaning, that the CARES funding that we are eligible for is not cash
in the bank-- that we are required to spend the money and then apply for reimbursement.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes.
KATE WILLIAMS: It's not cash we have in the bank, and that the reimbursement is not always
guaranteed. Hopefully most of our expenses qualify and are aptly documented. But we do not have $232
million in the bank. I'd like to just make sure that that is clear to everybody. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you.
MULTIPLE DIRECTORS: Madam Chair?
SHONTEL LEWIS: Director Williams, was that in lieu of what I shared, or you wanted to share that
generally?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I'm sorry, Director. Director Lewis, I would just say to you, if you could hold
your resolution, we're going to, in this Special Board Meeting, be talking about specifically all of the things
around security and safety and mental health, if you don't mind doing that. We will be having a
presentation from Mr. Meader and Chief Grado. And then I think all of it together could be really a good
package.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Thank you. No, I don't mind. I just wanted to clarify for Director that I was responsive
to her comment, in case it was directed towards me. So that's what I was asking, if-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah.
KATE WILLIAMS: No, no.
SHONTEL LEWIS: I'm cool with that.
KATE WILLIAMS: I know it's hard to believe, Director Lewis, but it didn't have anything to do with your
proposal for mental health that you and I discussed, and I told you I supported. I just to have had a
number of constituents ask me of what we plan to do with our $232 million in the bank. And so I wanted to
make sure that we did put out in public that that's a potential for reimbursement, and it's not money that
we have now. It didn't have anything to do with you.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Yeah, no. I think that's wise. I've had that same thing, so I appreciate you bringing that
knowledge to the general public.
KATE WILLIAMS: Cool. Thank you, ma'am.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: All right. Great. Any other matters to come before this board?
SHELLEY COOK: Madam Chair, Shelley Cook.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Please.
SHELLEY COOK: Oh, OK. At the meeting last week, we had talked about the idea that we'd bring forward
a report on the development of some principles-- some guideposts-- so forth for approaching our COVID
budget reduction. And I just wanted to comply with that and say that I've been talking with board
members-- getting very good input. I think that there are probably a couple of areas that we readily agree
to.
For example, on safety and/or transparency-- able to identify a principle pretty readily, and I think we'll be
proud of those. But we also will bring forward others that require a bit more discussion. And I'm
fortunately able to talk with people-- having really good conversations about some of that.
And we'll be working through that over the next week or so. And just wanting to let you know that that was
under way. Everybody's been really helpful and thoughtful in those discussions.

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK. Thank you, Director Cook. And I look forward to that. I think that it is
some very, very good dialogue that has been going on, so thank you for that work. Anyone else on the
board have any other matter to come before the board? Hearing none, I will now entertain a motion to
adjourn.
BOB BROOM: I move we adjourn.
KATE WILLIAMS: So move. Second.
VINCE BUZEK: Second, Buzek.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Broom?
BOB BROOM: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: And who was the second?
KATE WILLIAMS: Williams.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, Director Williams. So we are adjourned as of 5:52 PM.
