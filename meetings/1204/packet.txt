REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
LAMAR ADVERTISING REVIEW
AUDIT REPORT # 13-06-01

RTD has contracted with the Lamar Advertising Company to sell advertising space
on both the interior and exterior of RTD bus and light rail vehicles. The original
contract was effective for three years from January 1, 2010 through December
31, 2012. In late 2012, the contract was re-evaluated by RTD and resulted in a
reduction to the minimum annual payments required from Lamar, because of fewer
than expected bus and light rail vehicles operating in regular service. The revised
annual minimums are $2.32 million for buses and $1.2 million for light rail vehicles,
starting in 2012. The bus minimum annual is paid to RTD ‘up-front’ in January.
The light rail minimum fees are received quarterly by RTD. At the same time, the
contract was extended through December 31, 2014
AUDIT SCOPE
Our testing included a review of the contractual agreement with Lamar Advertising
and an evaluation of the controls and procedures in place for calculating and
remitting advertising revenue to the District, ensuring that all such funds are
received.
CONCLUSION
We have recommended an internal meeting be arranged between appropriate RTD
departments, including Procurement, Marketing, and Accounting to review current
procedures and evaluate potential enhancements to ensure that all earned
advertising revenue is received and accounted for.
CURRENT STATUS
Mutually agreed upon corrective action is underway as a meeting is being
scheduled for late July. This will be subject to normal Internal Audit follow-up
review.

BACKGROUND SUMMARY

1.C.1.a

BACKGROUND SUMMARY
RTD utilizes significant Information Technology (IT) resources, including personnel,
hardware, and software, in the day to day operations of providing commuter
transit services. Ensuring adequate security and confidentiality over a company’s
information technology is critical in today’s public environment. Computer
technology must be adequately controlled to ensure that systems are protected
from both internal and external risks.
AUDIT SCOPE
Our testing primarily emphasized software access controls, particularly over
selected Oracle modules after the recent upgrade to Release R12. In an effort to
avoid duplication of effort, we limited our testing in selected areas that RTD’s
external auditors, Rubin Brown, had recently reviewed. In addition, RTD has a
representative on a new APTA ‘task force’ that is studying external ‘Cyber
Threats’ against transportation companies. As such, we did not include this area
in our current review as their report is due later this year.
CONCLUSION
We recommended that IT periodically provide department managers with a list of
their employee’s software access permissions for review, including the use of
Super User which allows permitted employees to enter or modify Oracle
transactions. We also suggested that management consider creating the position
of IT Security Administrator when internal head count allows for it.

REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
INTERMOUNTAIN COACH CONTRACT REVIEW
AUDIT REPORT # 13-05-01
BACKGROUND SUMMARY
In June 2010 RTD issued an “Invitation for Bid” (IFB) in search for a firm to
“Supply 32 Cutaway Buses, with an option to purchase 15 more over a five year
period”. Intermountain Coach Inc. was justified as the winning provider and a
contract was prepared to describe each party’s responsibilities.
The agreement is ongoing at this time. The purchased vehicles are primarily utilized
for RTD’s Access-a-Ride and Call-n-Ride services. An initial fixed price for these
buses was just over $54,000 per unit. Future years’ price increases are tied to an
agreed upon calculation utilizing a specified ‘Bureau of Labor Statistics Producer
Price Index for Truck and Bus Bodies’. Recent purchases in the first quarter of
2013 cost just over $57,000 per unit.
AUDIT SCOPE
Our review included the process to develop the IFB within RTD, solicit various
firms, obtain and evaluate proposals from those expressing an interest in bidding
on the specified vehicles, and selecting the winning firm. We also reviewed the
controls over vendor invoices to ensure new vehicles were received and properly
inspected, to validate they met RTD requirements before payment was approved.
CONCLUSION
We noted that the contract award process was appropriately followed and the
selection of Intermountain Coach as the winning bidder was justified. Invoices

Second Quarter 2013 Investment Report

Information

Discussion
Please find RTD’s investment report for the second quarter of 2013 attached.
The U.S. economy expanded modestly (1.7 percent) during the second quarter of 2013. The
unemployment rate remained unchanged over the period but still remains elevated and general
inflationary pressures remain tame.
In order to promote economic recovery, the Federal Reserve chose to continue with its accommodative
monetary policy and leave the federal funds target rate range (0.0% - 0.25%) unchanged during the
second quarter noting that this level will continue to “be appropriate at least as long as unemployment
remains above 6.5% and inflation expectations continue to be well anchored”.
RTD’s Investment Policy (the “Policy”) is conservative in nature and seeks to satisfy the three primary
objectives of: safety, liquidity and yield, in that order of importance.
The Policy specifies that:
“Quarterly reports shall outline the District’s total investment return and compare the portfolio’s
performance to a publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics
to the portfolio or sub-portfolio being measured. For the liquidity tier of the portfolio (cash and cash
equivalents), the specified index shall be the 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index as published by Bank of
America Merrill Lynch for the period being measured. For the enhanced cash portion of the portfolio
(securities maturing between 90 days and 5 years and with a target duration of 1 year), the designated
performance benchmark will be the Merrill Lynch 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.”
The total return on the liquidity and enhanced cash tiers of RTD’s unrestricted portfolio and investment
benchmarks were as follows:

The yield of RTD’s unrestricted portfolio through the second quarter of 2013 was 0.70% which would
produce annualized earnings of $2.067 million. The current return for the month of June was 0.47%.

Fiscal Sustainability Recommendations Update

Information

BACKGROUND
A Fiscal Sustainability Task Force (Task Force) was formed in November 2010 for the purpose of making
recommendations, through a written report to the RTD Board of Directors, detailing opportunities for
operating efficiencies and revenue enhancement for the Base System to ensure RTD’s long-term fiscal
sustainability. The Task Force consisted of 22 members with 12 of those members being external to
RTD. The Task Force presented its recommendations to the Board of Directors in June 2011. The
Board of Directors subsequently approved those recommendations and directed Staff to pursue
implementation of each recommendation. The Task Force reconvened for a final meeting in July 2012
to be briefed on the progress of their recommendations and provide an opportunity for feedback.

DISCUSSION
The Task Force made revenue enhancement, expense reduction and fiscal policy recommendations to
the Board of Directors which were approved for further consideration and/or implementation. The status
of those Task Force recommendations is as follows:
Recommendations - Completed
Removing the Volatility from Sales and Use Tax Projections
RTD contracted with the University of Colorado, Leeds School of Business – Business Research Division
(Leeds) to provide sales and use tax forecasts beginning in March 2011. Each quarter, Leeds provides a
forecast containing short-term (one year by quarter), medium-term (six year SBP period) and long-term
(30 year APE period) tax projections. This function was implemented to provide RTD with expert
economic analysis and sales and use tax forecasts using sophisticated financial modeling techniques not
available internally. These forecasts are intended to provide a better analysis of RTD’s expected sales
and use tax collections which comprise approximately 2/3 of RTD’s recurring revenues.
Service Optimization
In January 2012, RTD implemented modifications and reductions in service representing approximately
$10.7 million or an 8% net reduction in service. Service optimization was recommended by the Task
Force and implemented with Board approval in order to match services provided with available funding
sources.
Fund Balance Policy
Due to the volatility of RTD’s largest single revenue source, sales and use taxes, the Task Force
recommended implementation of a more robust fiscal policy regarding fund balances. Fund balances
represent financial assets that are available to RTD after allowing for obligations that have been incurred.
Fund balances increase when fund sources exceed fund uses and vice versa. Fund balances therefore
exist as a form of savings account to be used for specific purposes when needed and replenished when
economic circumstances allow. In response to this recommendation, RTD implemented a fund balance

Packet Pg. 13

1.C.3

policy with a target level of $90 million for the Base System, which is approximately three months of
operating expenses. This target was established based on levels recommended by the Government
Finance Officers Association (GFOA) best practices. The Fund Balance Policy further categorizes the
available fund balances into the categories of a Board Restricted Fund, a Capital Replacement Fund and
an Unrestricted Fund.
Sales and Use Tax Exemptions
In Colorado, legislation establishes products and services that are subject to sales and use taxation and
those that are exempt from taxation. The state, cities, municipalities and special districts in Colorado
each have different sales and use tax rates and often have differing items subject to taxation due to
legislation establishing exemptions. RTD introduced legislation which was passed in May 2013 to
establish parity with the state regarding items subject to sales and use taxation. Exemption parity was
identified by the Task Force as providing a benefit to RTD during difficult economic conditions when the
state implements exemption changes and vice versa. In addition, exemption parity removes the
complexity to vendors of RTD having different taxable items than the state. Exemption parity will take
effect January 1, 2014.
Technology and Energy Innovation
Regarding energy innovation, RTD conducted a comprehensive energy audit of the oldest and largest
operating division (the Platte facility) to determine the potential scope of savings that may be available
through equipment and lighting upgrades. The audit identified that facility lighting upgrades could result
in potentially significant energy savings. Areas for minor energy savings were identified for other
building systems, however, these have a very significant capital investment and long pay-back periods.
Based on this information, RTD has budgeted for energy upgrades throughout the District in the strategic
budget plan, and will address energy efficiency in building systems as on-going projects are completed.
RTD has evaluated a variety of solar applications which also require significant capital investment with a
relatively long-term pay-back period. RTD was successful in receiving a grant to install solar panels at
East Metro and this project is underway.

Recommendations – Ongoing
Sales and Use Tax Compliance Reviews
The Colorado Department of Revenue (DOR) collects and audits sales and use taxes for RTD. The Task
Force identified an opportunity for revenue enhancement by performing additional sales and use tax
compliance reviews based on the favorable collection experiences of Colorado cities and municipalities
that implemented these reviews. Compliance reviews consist of RTD providing additional resources
from a contracted provider to supplement the DOR’s audit function. Due to the complexity of sales and
use tax filing requirements and tax boundaries in Colorado, this recommendation is intended to provide
the DOR with the additional resources necessary to ensure complete and timely tax compliance by
vendors. An Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) between RTD and the DOR is substantially complete
with the next step to finalize an RFP for compliance review services. RTD expects to initiate these
services in late 2013.
Naming Rights
The Board approved RTD securing the services of a corporate sponsorship and naming rights consultant,
and RTD entered into a contract with the internationally known firm IMG. Per their contract, IMG is
conducting an inventory and financial analysis of RTD facilities, services and assets that may lend
themselves to naming/sponsorship value-added contracts. The Board will be updated on this process the

Packet Pg. 14

1.C.3

third and fourth quarters of 2013, and contract opportunities will be presented to the Board for their
approval on a case-by-case basis.
Partnerships and Privatization
The Task Force described this recommendation as a broad area that could include items such as
privatizing routes and administrative and operational functions to reduce expenses. RTD has undertaken
some actions under this recommendation such as the lease of the DUS historic building, IGAs for
improvements to US36 and the East Line, as well as TOD activities. RTD continues to look for
partnership and privatization opportunities on an ongoing basis.

Recommendations – Low Near-Term Priority
Recommendations made by the Task Force and categorized at the 2012 Board Retreat as having lower
near-term priority and their status are as follows:
Charge for Parking
RTD currently charges out-of-District patrons parking fees to use parking facilities as well as fees
charged to in-District patrons parking for longer than 24 hours. The Task Force identified charging
parking fees to all patrons as a possible revenue enhancement source. This recommendation could be
perceived as a fare increase.
Tolling and Managed Lanes
The Task Force recommended investigating the possibility of RTD generating additional revenues through
charges for tolling and managed lanes. Enacting this recommendation would require coordination with
CDOT and other agencies.
Home Rule Initiative
The Task Force recommended that RTD consider becoming a “Home Rule” entity which would allow
RTD to collect and audit its sales and use taxes instead of the DOR. This initiative would require
legislation. RTD met several times with the DOR to discuss this initiative as well as sales and use tax
compliance reviews. Although the DOR did not object to RTD performing these services itself, the
Colorado Municipal League and other entities recommended against it.
