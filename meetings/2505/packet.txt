RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager to include new parking facilities in the Parking Management Program.
BACKGROUND
The Board-approved 2008 Parking Management Program was implemented in 2009 under constraints
imposed by the Colorado State legislature that limited which patrons can be charged for parking to, (1)
out-of-District patrons every day, (2) in-District patrons after the first 24 hours, and (3) reserved parking
in exchange for a flat monthly fee. Patrons may pay for parking at pay stations with exact cash or
credit, with pay-by-phone or with an “automated” account (pre-arranged, declining balance, 15%
discounted), or in-District patrons may subscribe to the Reserved parking program which reserves them
the right to access parking in a designated pool between 5am and 10am each weekday. After 10am
unused spaces may be used by any patron (at facilities where Reserved demand exceeds the legislated
maximum of 15% of each facility’s capacity, a waiting list is created). Approximately 18% of RTD
boardings result from patrons who park at RTD facilities and about 15% of those who park actually pay
for parking in one form or another.
At the time the Program was adopted approximately forty (40) parking facilities were included in the
Program, referred to as “designated facilities”. In November of 2012, when parking management
contract amendments were being considered by the Board, the new West Corridor parking facilities were
“designated” for inclusion in the Parking Management Program. That was the first major addition to
“designated facilities” since adoption in 2008. Prior to that time minor deletions, based upon unique
circumstances, had occurred as provided in the original Program. With various deletions, closings and
the addition of West Corridor, the Program currently is implemented at 36 RTD operated facilities.
DISCUSSION
In 2016, consistent with our practice of implementing the Program in all parking facilities in a corridor,
we plan to add the parking facilities in University of Colorado A Line, B Line, G Line and R Line that will
add 14 new parking facilities, 3 of which may be operated by others depending upon the outcome of
negotiations. In accordance with the existing contract, SP+ (formerly Central Parking) will purchase the
pay stations and other necessary equipment to manage these facilities and will recover the cost from
parking revenues.
After review of how facilities are included in the Program, the General Manager, as an alternative to
seeking Board approval on a case by case basis, believes the Board may agree that it is more efficient to
grant the General Manager broader authority to include new parking facilities in the Parking Management
Program as deemed appropriate consistent with size, location, ownership, stakeholder participation and
shared use considerations. This would align inclusion of parking facilities into the Parking Management
Program with the timing of planning and design of parking facilities.

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Addition of these 2016 facilities will increase annual parking revenues and will capture a greater portion
of extended parking beyond the first day by DIA travelers. Operating expenses are recovered from
revenues.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager to include new parking facilities in the Parking
Management Program.
2. Do not adopt the recommended action. Authorize the General Manager to include only new
parking facilities in the Parking Management Program that are planned to open in 2016, as
mentioned above.

IGA with Aurora
Parking Structure

concerning

Iliff

Station

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager to negotiate and execute an agreement with the City of Aurora for the
utilization of the Iliff Station Parking Structure consistent with the terms outlined under Discussion in
this Action.
BACKGROUND
The Iliff Station Parking Structure IGA was negotiated to fulfill Aurora’s desire to have a parking
structure instead of two surface lots that were in the FasTracks plan. This was conceived as a mutually
beneficial partnership that would accelerate development and enhance ridership long term at no
additional cost to RTD with the same 600 parking spaces available for RTD patrons.
The following table depicts capital, in-kind and estimated operation and maintenance costs and
responsibilities pertinent to each party according to the IGA:

Aurora seeks to, in part, offset its significant investment in the garage by implementing charges for
parking at this facility. Since the 600 spaces were reserved for RTD, the IGA requires that any such
parking plan receive approval in advance by the RTD Board of Directors in the Board’s sole discretion.
The IGA also specifies that a contingency financial plan should be developed by Aurora in the event a
proposed parking plan is not approved by the RTD Board. In the same spirit, the Iliff Garage Land lease
provided that the land upon which the parking structure is located will be leased to Aurora at no cost,

1.B.2

except that the parties shall address revenue generation issues as a part of a parking management plan
proposal.
In May 2016, the City of Aurora proposed terms for an Iliff Garage Parking Management Plan to RTD.
Aurora’s pro-forma analysis indicates that it is not likely that the City will break even before the third
year even in light of RTD’s O&M contribution and rent subsidy. During negotiations with RTD, Aurora
preferred to postpone discussion of revenue generation issues, effectively explaining that ridership
originating from Iliff Station needs a period of time to mature before any reliable revenue projections can
be made.
DISCUSSION
After consideration and negotiation, RTD staff agreed that the following principles for a parking
management plan with the City of Aurora (COA) for the Iliff Garage be submitted to the RTD Board of
Directors for consideration to cover this initial three year evaluation period as follows:


Term of Original Agreement: 3 years



Parking rates:
o COA shall implement an opening daily rate $3.00, with a not to exceed daily rate of $5.00
o COA shall implement a Monthly Reserved program, as defined below, with an opening rate
$50.00 not to exceed $85.00
o In order to achieve a utilization rate of at least 75% “average occupancy”, following an 18
month stabilization period, COA shall reduce first day parking rates below $3, including
reducing first day daily parking rates to $0 on an incremental basis. Monthly reserved parking
fees shall also be reduced to achieve 75% average occupancy if necessary. COA may choose
to reduce parking rates during the “stabilization period” if it deems conditions warrant. If first
day daily rates are reduced to $0.00 a second and subsequent day rate of at least $2.00 will
be retained, not to exceed 30 continuous days. Average occupancy is defined as occupancy
data collected over a one month period for weekday, working days only (holidays, weekends
excluded). Occupancy data will be collected during the midday timeframe to most accurately
reflect facility utilization. “Stabilization period” is defined as a timeframe not to exceed 18
months where parking rates would not be required to reduce in order to reach 75% average
occupancy in order for transit users to adjust travel habits and take advantage of the new
light rail transit service at Iliff Station.
o Rate changes: 60 day notice to RTD, Manager, Parking Management
o Overnight parking not to exceed 30 consecutive days.



Non-Transit Use of Transit Parking Spaces: Unless otherwise agreed by RTD in written form, 600
parking spaces shall be reserved for transit patron use at all times. On a case by case basis, RTD
agrees that the City of Aurora may plan to make use of unused transit parking space on evenings,
weekends and holidays to the extent that RTD does not anticipate RTD patron use of the Iliff
structure to access transit service during the proposed re-occurring periods or for scheduled events
and attractions at other transit served locations. The City of Aurora shall require a City Special Event
permit to be processed through the City Manager’s Office for each such proposed function at the Iliff
Garage 60 days prior to the proposed ongoing use or event. Each such City Special Event Permit
shall be subject to written approval by RTD. Approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, and an
RTD approval decision shall be provided to the City of Aurora within 7 working days of receipt by
RTD from the City of Aurora.

Packet Pg. 6

1.B.2



Replacement Agreement: Six months prior to the parking management plan’s full term, COA and
RTD will begin good faith negotiations to negotiate a replacement agreement to be submitted to RTD
Board of Directors for consideration.



Payment Options: Iliff Garage will be equipped with pay stations that accept all forms of payment,
along with a pay by phone and online payment platforms for customers through Aurora’s contractor.



Monthly Reserved Parking: Commuters shall be able to purchase monthly permits for spaces that are
reserved within the parking structure garage for parking on weekdays starting at 5am. If not filled by
10am by subscribers, these spaces become open to the public in an effort to maximize utilization of
the facility. Overnight parking is not allowed in spaces reserved for monthly commuter parking. The
number of such spaces sold shall not exceed 50% of the capacity of the parking structure.



Customer Care: Aurora shall provide patrons of the Iliff parking facility with industry standard
customer care for inquiries, dissemination of public information, conduct of necessary business and
resolution of disputes.



Enforcement Procedures: Iliff Garage shall be enforced for non-payment and other prohibited
activities. Parkers issued citations shall have a dispute process available to them that is transparent
and accessible. Enforcement shall be overseen by Aurora Parking Enforcement and Aurora City
citations shall be issued to offenders. Parkers issued parking citations shall have the opportunity to
dispute their citation if they so choose with the Aurora Parking Bureau, as part of the Aurora
Municipal Court.



Garage Access: Iliff Garage shall employ a gateless, pay by plate system that is similar to RTD
managed parking facilities.



Reporting: On a Quarterly basis, the City shall provide RTD with all pertinent parking usage figures
for the Iliff Garage, including parking revenue and expense details fully disclosing the purposes for
which parking revenue and the annual RTD subsidy have been expended. These summaries shall be
due to RTD no later than the mid-point of each subsequent quarter.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
This agreement will not alter RTD’s obligations under the Iliff Station Parking Structure IGA with Aurora
that requires an annual payment to Aurora of $94,500 in the first year escalated annually thereafter at
the rate of 2% compounded.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Adopt the recommendation by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board
of Directors authorize the General Manager to negotiate and execute an agreement with the City
of Aurora for the utilization of the Iliff Station Parking Structure consistent with the terms
outlined under Discussion in this Action.
2. Do not adopt the recommended action; rather, direct the General Manager to renegotiate the
terms and execute an IGA with Aurora with direction from the Board of Directors.
3. Do not adopt the recommended action.

Subject:

Proposed Fall 2016 Service Change

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the Fall 2016 Service Change package as revised and summarized in Attachment A resulting in
an annualized cost of approximately $785,800 and, further, to authorize the General Manager or his
designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is impacted
by these changes.
DISCUSSION
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. We will continue adjusting services in
response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. It is also
our responsibility to identify services that are underperforming and recommend modifications,
curtailment or cancellation of service as warranted. The proposals herein include a mix of service
enhancements, routine schedule adjustments and service reductions. Also included in this report is a
grant funded proposal anticipated to be implemented with the completion of North Central Park
Boulevard roadway construction. Funded through a CMAQ grant, the new Route 62 would operate
between the Central Park Boulevard Station and 60th/Dahlia in Commerce City. We will monitor customer
response to the implementation of these service changes and propose adjustments and service
alternatives as appropriate in future service change recommendations.
The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
 Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
 Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
SUMMARY OF PUBLIC HEARINGS
Two hearings were held in Denver at the Blake Administration building. Comments and further details
from these meetings and the service change website are summarized in Attachment C of this report.
CHANGES TO INITIAL RECOMMENDATIONS
Staff receives input during the public comment process and continues to conduct additional analysis
after the initial service recommendations are communicated to the Board of Directors. Depending on the
outcome of the public comment process and continued analysis, staff may or may not propose
modifications to these initial recommendations. Due to the relatively small number of proposals in the
Fall 2016 proposals, no significant changes are listed.

SUMMARY OF PROPOSED SERVICE CHANGES

Routes proposed for service improvements:
Route 15 – East Colfax: adjust PM peak westbound frequency
Route 62 – Commerce City/Stapleton: new grant funded route service
Route 122X-Wagon Road/Civic Center: add a.m. peak trip
C Line: add earlier northbound weekday trip
E Line: add earlier northbound weekday trip
Flatiron Flyer – US 36 BRT: add one PM eastbound Route FF6 trip

Routes proposed for routine running time analysis/schedule adjustments
Route 6 – East 6th Avenue: running time analysis
Route 15 – East Colfax: running time analysis
Route 15L – East Colfax Limited: running time analysis
Route 88 – Thornton/Commerce City/Stapleton: running time analysis
Route AB – Boulder/DIA: schedule adjustments
BOLT _ Boulder/Longmont: conversion of selected peak trips to limited stop service
Federal Boulevard Routes: running time analysis
Flatiron Flyer – US 36 BRT: routine schedule adjustments
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The overall financial impact contained in this proposal is estimated to be $785,800 annualized, with
$442,000 being funded through CMAQ grants, resulting in a net base system impact of $343,800.
EQUITY ANALYSIS
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and
Executive Order 12898 regarding Environmental Justice. In this circular, the FTA requires RTD to
evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that exceed the established major service
change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a disproportionately negative impact on
minority or low-income populations. Our evaluation of the proposed Fall 2016 service changes does not
reveal any disparities in impacts absorbed by minority or low-income populations.

Route 62 – Commerce City/Stapleton
In coordination with the grant approval from City of Commerce City, this proposal creates
a new route service between Central Park Boulevard Station to 60th/Dahila, via Central
Park Boulevard, Prairie Parkway, Trenton Street and 60th Avenue. This service would offer
half-hourly headways on weekdays and hourly service on Saturdays and Sunday between
the hours of 6:00am to 6:00pm. This service would begin upon the completion of
construction of North Central Park Boulevard and modifications to curb line on Trenton
Street at 60th Avenue. Anticipated cost impacts are fully grant funded and estimated to be
$442,800 annualized.
Route 88 – Thorton/Commerce City/Stapleton
Running time analysis, resulting in minor schedule adjustments is proposed. No cost
impacts are anticipated.
Route 122X – Wagon Road/ Civic Center
Add one southbound 7:50am trip, from Wagon Rd, to address overload issues. Anticipated
cost impacts are estimated to be $12,000 annualized.
Route AB – Boulder/DIA

1.B.3.a

Attachment A - Fall 2016 Service Change

Flatiron Flyer – US36 BRT
It is proposed to add one FF6 trip, eastbound, at 4pm from Boulder Junction to Union
Station to replace former Route S trip. Additionally, it is proposed to add 2 FF2 trips in
both the morning and evening peak period to address passenger overloads currently being
accommodated using Loop Extras, which are vehicles set aside to support operation of the
corridor. Anticipated cost impacts are estimated to be $70,000 annualized. Running time
adjustments for FF1, FF2, FF3, FF4, FF5 and FF6 are also proposed with no additional
cost impacts anticipated.

Rail
C Line – Mineral Station/Union Station
It is proposed to add an earlier northbound weekday morning trip. The trip that was added
in August 2015 is meeting the 10% boardings per hour service standard for light rail and
multiple customers have written requesting an earlier trip for University of Colorado A Line
connections. A morning pullout from the north end of Elati can be changed to pullout from
the south and still cover this trip. This trip would depart Mineral Station at 4:42 AM and
arrive Denver Union Station at 5:10 AM. It is also proposed to add an earlier C Line
pullout trip by utilizing an existing out of service train that interlines to a W Line train.
This trip would depart Evans Station at 4:24 AM and arrive Denver Union Station at 4:40
AM.
E Line – Lincoln Station/Union Station
It is proposed to add an earlier northbound weekday morning trip. The trip that was added
in January 2016 is meeting the 10% boardings per hour service standard for light rail and
multiple customers have written requesting an earlier trip for University of Colorado A Line
connections. The existing trip that departs Southmoor Station at 4:54 AM would be
extended to depart Lincoln Station at 4:49 AM and a new trip would be added to depart
Southmoor Station at 4:24 AM and arrive Denver Union Station at 4:49 AM.

Anticipated cost impacts of the C and E Line proposals is estimated to be $106,000

Citations For Failure To Tap Smart Media
Technology

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the RTD Board approve
revisions to the RTD Fare enforcement policy to issue citations to patrons that fail to comply with the
tapping requirement regarding smart media technology, to include Business EcoPass, Neighborhood
EcoPass, and CollegePass effective January 1, 2017.
BACKGROUND
Business EcoPass is an annual employer-sponsored pass providing employees unlimited rides on RTD bus
and rail, Neighborhood EcoPass provides residents in participating neighborhoods unlimited rides on RTD
bus and rail and CollegePass is an annual college-sponsored pass providing students unlimited rides on
RTD bus and rail. All three are contractually based annual pass programs. These passes have explicit
instructions to tap the issued smart cards before boarding RTD transportation to indicate a required
payment of fare.
DISCUSSION
The current Business and Neighborhood EcoPass and CollegePass fare enforcement policy was
implemented in January of 2013. This policy is currently contained in all contract agreements. The
existing policy states that failure to tap or to select the correct service level may result in the following:
 First Offense: Rider is issued a warning.
 Second Offense: Seven-day suspension of card.
 Third Offense: Thirty-day suspension of card.
 Fourth Offense: Pass is confiscated and suspended for the remainder of the calendar year.
This policy was implemented when a fare violation was a criminal offense and it was felt that if a patron
that did not tap, they should not be subjected to a possible criminal record. The offense of Fare Evasion
has now been reclassified to a lesser offense and falls under Colorado Traffic Code. It has been
determined that the current discipline measures are difficult and cumbersome to enforce and best
practice would be to align the Business and Neighborhood EcoPass and CollegePass fare enforcement
policy with RTD’s current fare enforcement policy for cash fares and the MyRide stored value smart
card.
Utilization data for the Business and Neighborhood EcoPass and CollegePass programs is an important
factor in the development of future pricing structures. If a patron in possession of the fare media does
not comply with the instructions of tapping the card before boarding their mode of transportation, RTD
loses valuable information. Even though both forms of fare media are pre-paid through contractual
agreements, if the patron does not adhere to the contractual instructions, the patron has violated
Colorado Statute 42-4-1416 Failure to Present a Valid Transit Pass, because the fare media was not
activated from being tapped to show that the fare media is in fact valid. The statute was reviewed by
RTD legal counsel and the findings were that the failure to tap did fit within the definition of the statute.

Packet Pg. 18

1.B.4

The current practice for a first offense is a warning. A second offense and multiple offenses by the
same person are fined $82.50 in Denver County and $106.50 in all other counties within the RTD
District. If the violator does not pay their fine, that person cannot renew their Driver’s License until the
fine is paid.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The cost of checking the fare media and issuing a warning or citation based on the patrons past fare
history is already included in the yearly budget and will not cost any additional funding. The
implementation of having patrons adhere to the regulations from the fare media would have impact on
future pass program pricing because it would provide a more accurate count of utilization. A marketing
campaign will be needed to inform riders of the change of policy and information will be sent to
businesses and neighborhoods currently in the EcoPass program and colleges that utilize the CollegePass
program. Internal training would be needed for sales division, customer service division, and bus and rail
operations. The cost would be minimal since the budgets of all the divisions are already established.
ALTERNATIVE
Do not change the fare enforcement policy. Impacts of this alternative include having to support an
ineffective and labor intensive process that is inconsistent with the fare enforcement policy for all other
RTD products.

Subject:

Amend Contract 25FK006 - Cutaway Buses to
add enhanced ADA features

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to amend contract 25FK006 in an amount not to exceed
$340,000 with Master’s Transportation, a dealer for Goshen Coach, for the addition of ADA-related
items to better accommodate passengers with disabilities.
It is also recommended that the Board of Directors authorize the transfer of $340,000 from the Flatiron
Flyer bus procurement, the cutaway transit bus and the in-plant vehicles & equipment projects to cover
the cost of the requested additional items.
BACKGROUND
In support of the Board adopted strategic goal of Innovative and Fiscally Sustainable Service Delivery,
including Asset Management/State of Good Repair, Bus Operations has begun the process of replacing
the aging and high maintenance cutaway buses used for the Access-a-Ride service.
On January 19, 2016 the RTD Board of Directors approved the procurement of up to 241 cutaway
buses. This procurement was the result of RTD Invitation for Bids (IFB 25FK006) on October 19, 2015.
Bids were received on December 8, 2015. Master’s Transportation was the responsive and responsible
low bidder.
In June this year, the bus manufacturer, Goshen Coach, built a pilot bus and sent it to Denver for RTD
review and approval. RTD invited members of ADA Paratransit Advisory Committee (APAC) and the
Colorado Cross Disability Coalition (CCDC) to review the ADA features of the bus. As a result of this
review, five changes were requested by the group, to include the addition of more handrails and hand
straps to assist ambulatory passengers in standing up from a seating position and moving about the bus,
and the reconfiguration of the wheelchair tiedowns to better accommodate various sizes of wheelchair
devices.
This request is for the Board’s approval of the contract amendment to Master’s Transportation for the
addition of ADA features to better accommodate passengers with disabilities, and to transfer funds from
three projects, Flatiron Flyer bus procurement, cutaway transit bus and in-plant vehicles & equipment
projects to cover for the additional cost.
DISCUSSION
The new Goshen cutaway buses will be 24’ long. The buses will be equipped with an extended
sized wheelchair lift to accommodate large sized wheelchairs, eight foldable seats for ambulatory
passengers, and three wheelchair tiedown areas.
FINANCIAL IMPACT

Packet Pg. 20

1.B.5

Additional funds in the amount of $340,000 are needed to fund the contract amendment. Capital funds
from three projects, Flatiron Flyer bus procurement, cutaway transit bus procurement and in-plant
vehicles and equipment procurement, are available for transfer to this project. These projects have been
completed or are in process of being completed. We are recommending the transfer of existing excess
capital funds from three closing-out projects into this contract. No additional funds are required so the
capital budget impact is zero.
DBE PARTICIPATION
There is no DBE requirement for transit vehicle purchases. Each vehicle manufacturer is required by the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to submit a DBE plan for FTA approval. As part of the required
proposal submittal documents, the bus manufacturer, Goshen Coach, has submitted a certificate
attesting to FTA’s approval of its DBE plan.
ALTERNATIVES
1. To authorize the General Manager to issue a contract amendment to Master’s Transportation for the
addition of ADA bus features, and to transfer the capital funds to fund the amendment. This is the
recommended alternative.
2. Do not authorize the contract amendment. This is not desirable as it would result in the production
and delivery of Access-a-Ride buses that do not fully accommodate the expressed needs of the disabled
community.

Service Performance 2015
Networked Family of Services

RTD’s Mission is: "To meet our constituents' present and future public transit needs by offering safe, clean,
reliable, courteous, accessible and cost-effective service throughout the district." In order to assist the District
in achieving this Mission, service development and performance analysis require that we ask several questions
in order to optimize RTD’s resource allocation for the provision of transit services. What are the markets or
demand? Should service be provided and if so how much? What type of service should be provided? RTD’s
general approach is as follows: Develop a family of services suited to a variety of markets; connect all the
services together in a network to accommodate today’s dispersed travel patterns; and match the level-ofservice with demand, thus improving performance and sustainability.

RTD service standards are depicted in the charts to help
make judgments about performance. Each rectangle
labeled by service type represents the domain for routes
that meet or exceed the 10% minimum/maximum
performance requirements for that service class. So this
is a case where it’s bad to be “outside the box.”

Subsidy per Boarding or Effectiveness

Performance is a term often used interchangeably with effectiveness and efficiency. The effectivenessproductivity charts in this report present these measures for all RTD services. Effectiveness measures
attainment of the objective—maximize ridership within
the budget—and is presented on the y-axis as subsidy
Effectiveness - Productivity Chart
per boarding. Efficiency—productivity or output/input—
Lower
is presented on the x-axis as boardings/vehicle hour.
Same boardings,
The charts offer a convenient, comparative analysis of all
less subsidy
classes of services, illustrating both absolute and relative
performance.
Better

Same subsidy,
more boardings

Boardings per Vehicle Hour or Productivity

Higher

Routes that perform minimally get minimum service frequency, typically every 30 minutes during peak periods
and 60 minutes off-peak. The charts also depict guidelines for routes where ridership significantly exceeds the
minimum, and passenger loads justify more frequent service. The orange, dotted, vertical line at 25 boardings
per hour represents the typical minimum productivity for a route to justify 15-minute frequency, and the
green line at 40 boardings per hour for 10-minute frequency.
Please note that these are true apples-to-apples comparisons of performance: all fare revenues, boardings
and costs—both operating and amortized capital—are included. For complete, detailed information see RTD’s
Transit Service Policies & Standards (under Reports).

Overview

1.C.1.a

Regional Transportation District

 Boardings: Unlinked passenger trips; includes transfers as boardings.
 Hours: In-service vehicle hours, not including dead head garage time or layover/recovery.
 Fare Revenues: Cash, ticket, and tokens allocated by route by farebox recorded boardings. Monthly pass
revenues are allocated by class of pass and the number of uses by route. Revenue from Eco, CU, and Auraria
passes are allocated individually by the counts for each route weighted by the ratio of the class of service
fare to the local fare.
 Costs: All operating, maintenance and administrative costs for providing current service, plus depreciation
on all RTD assets. Excludes interest and any costs attributed to future projects. RTD’s cost allocation model
allocates costs to each route based on its miles, hours, and peak vehicles; accounting line items are assigned
to the most relevant variable.
 Subsidy: Costs minus Fare Revenues.
Standards
RTD has established guidelines in its Transit Service Policies & Standards that the least productive 10% of
routes based on either subsidy per boarding or boardings per hour need to be evaluated for marketing,
revision or elimination, or if both measures fall below 25% for a route. The performance charts illustrate the
acceptable performance domain containing all routes meeting the 10% minimum/maximum for each class of
service. The calculation of the 10% and 25% standards are made from the annual, un-weighted data, assuming
the data have a normal distribution and using the appropriate formulas for standard deviation and confidence
intervals; however, the standard deviation is applied to the weighted average. The following table gives the
current year weighted averages and standards by class of service.

Notes on Routes Outside Their Acceptable Performance Domain
The following provides status as of July, 2016 listed in route number order.

Route 9 West 10th Ave – Restructured April 2013 with the West Corridor opening. Current ridership
productivity slipped below standard this year and this route will be monitored for further action.
Route 26 West 26th Ave — New service introduced April 2013 with the West Corridor restructuring. This route
meets productivity standard, but is below for subsidy per boarding. It was recombined with Route 28 28th Ave
August, 2015.
Route 28 28th Ave – Current ridership and subsidy are below standards. It was recombined with Route 26
August, 2015. Further service reductions occurred in April 2016 with implementation of the University of
Colorado A Line service plan.
Route 32 32nd Ave/City Park – Current ridership and subsidy are below standards. Duplication with the Route
40 on Colorado Blvd was eliminated in April 2016.
Route 34 West 3rd Avenue Commuter —This is a small route that has been restructured several times in
recent years and serves passengers with disabilities. It was restructured again as Route 33 in August 2015.
Route 45 Montbello/Green Valley Ranch – This route has been restructured in the University of Colorado A
Line service change in April 2016.
Route 46 South Dahlia St — This route meets the subsidy standard, but ridership declined some and it does
not meet productivity standard. It will be monitored.
Routes 47X Green Valley Ranch/Montbello Express — This route was combined with the Route 48X Green
Valley Ranch Express for improved performance overall January 2012. This peak period only service was
replaced by the University Of Colorado A-Line Line rail service in April 2016.
Route 50 Lakes Crosstown – This route will be merged with Route 51 Sheridan Blvd and placed in the Urban
Local class when the G-Line opens in 2016.
Route 54 Montbello Industrial Park — This route was discontinued in April 2016 with the East Corridor Service
Plan.
Route 67 Ridge Rd – This route is just below productivity and subsidy standards. It will be monitored.

Route 3 Ltd East Alameda — This is a well utilized route that easily meets the boardings per hour standard.
However, its subsidy per boarding is higher than most other CBD Local routes because the 3Ltd is a peak
period, peak direction only service and is thus more expensive to operate. Some efficiency measures are
planned with the opening of the R-Line in 2016.

1.C.1.a

Regional Transportation District

Route 80X – This became the 80L January 2016.
Route 89 Stapleton/Anschutz Campus – This route was started January 2013 to serve new transitional housing
and in anticipation of the opening of the East Corridor rail services in 2016. In 2014 service was reduced by
half due to poor performance and ridership fell precipitously. This service will be monitored for rider response
in 2016 for potential discontinuance.

Route 116L Ken Caryl Limited – This route was implemented with the opening of the West Corridor in April
2013. It is performing poorly and is a candidate for potential discontinuance.
Route 116X South Simms – Discontinued with the Route KC in April 2013 with the West Corridor opening, but
was returned immediately due to customer requests (Route KC was discontinued). It will be monitored for
potential changes or discontinuance.
Route 206 Pearl/Manhattan/Fairview High School — This route easily meets the subsidy standard, but does
not meet productivity standard. Service changes are planned for 2017.
Route 323 Skyline Crosstown — Restructured Longmont routes January 2013. Longmont Local routes became
free fare in July 2014. It meets subsidy, but not productivity standards. Will need to monitor and evaluate
service options, especially if free fare is discontinued.
Route 327 Northside Loop Counterclockwise — Restructured Longmont routes January 2013. Longmont Local
routes became free fare in July 2014. It does not meet standards even with the free fare. Continue to monitor
for potential changes or discontinuance.
Route 401 Ranches Crosstown — Discontinued midday weekday and weekend service west of Mineral Station
and replaced with S Jeffco call-n-Ride January 2012. It is just below subsidy and productivity standards.
Route 403 Lucent Blvd — Service realigned and retimed for January 2014 and performance improved
somewhat. It is now below subsidy and productivity standards and will be monitored.
Route 410 Franktown/Parker — This route was substantially revised with the reinstatement of Route P
Parker/Denver Spring 2007. Service was reduced to every 30 minutes peak and every two hours midday.
Service was reduced to peak period only May 2009. Additional trips added January 2014 in response to public
meetings where constituents noted that this would make the route more attractive. In 2016 this route was
combined with a portion of the Route 153 to form the new Route 483 Lincoln/Parker/Nine Mile.
Route CV Pine Junction/Conifer/Denver – This route is slightly below subsidy standard, but above productivity
standard. It will be monitored
Route DD Downtown Boulder/Anshutz – This route is just below standards and was changed to the FF5 as part
of the Flatiron Flyer January 2016 and will be monitored.

Route EV Evergreen/Aspen Park/Denver – This route is just below subsidy and just above productivity
standards and will be monitored.
Route GS Golden/Boulder – This route is just below subsidy and productivity standards.

Route T Boulder/Greenwood Plaza — This route was discontinued with the opening of the Flatiron Flyer
services in January, 2016.
Route AA Wagon Road/DIA — Performance is just below service standards. Considering potential
restructuring with the North Metro Corridor service plan.
Belmar Call-n-Ride – In 2014 and 2015 service was reconfigured to discontinue the flex-route and serve Oak
rail station, but ridership did not improve. This service was discontinued April 2016.
Evergreen Call-n-Ride – Ridership fell due to discontinuation of two local programs. A Transportation Advisory
Committee was formed to increase ridership. It is just below service standards and will be monitored.
Highlands Ranch Call-n-Ride — It was proposed to discontinue service in 2009 and 2014; however, the RTD
Board chose to retain it due to lack of alternatives and the high proportion of riders with disabilities. A
transportation Advisory Committee was formed and service area was reconfiguration and promotion in 2015
improved performance to just below service standards. It will be monitored.
C-Line – This line only slightly misses the subsidy per boarding standard and easily meets the boardings per
hour standard.
