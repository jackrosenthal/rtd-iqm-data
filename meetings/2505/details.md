#### 1. Parking Management Extended to New Facilities

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors approve adding to the RTD Parking Management Program all of RTD’s parking facilities along the University of Colorado A Line, B Line, G Line and R Line, except for Iliff Station and Olde Town Arvada Station; and to authorize the General Manager to amend RTD’s parking management Contract #13D0002 as necessary to include and manage the added facilities.

Prior to the Board having the opportunity to move the recommended action made by staff, Committee Chair Anderson asked for a motion to amend the Recommended Action in the May 9, 2016 Board Report to substitute the language to read:

“It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors approve adding to the RTD Parking Management Program all of RTD’s parking facilities along the University of Colorado A Line, B Line, G Line and R Line, except for Iliff Station and Olde Town Arvada Station; and to authorize the General Manager to amend RTD’s parking management Contract #13D0002 as necessary to include and manage the added facilities.”

Motion

to Approve

Substitute

Main Motion:               Chair Tobiassen made the motion to move approve a Substitute Main Motion as Committee Chair Anderson had read.

Director Walker seconded the motion.

Discussion:               Errol Stevens, Manager of Parking Management reiterated that staff is trying to get the new parking facilities in the FasTracks program added to RTD’s parking management program.  He added that this action item would only apply to the facilities that do not have any outside agreements such as the Illif Station or Olde Town Arvada.

Director Deadwyler asked what would RTD gain.  Errol Stevens stated that the new facilities will be managed like the others.  He added that RTD’s contractor will implement the program and collect the funds.  He stated that the contractor buys the equipment and pays for all of the costs, but they submit the net costs to RTD.

Director Hoy asked why the Westminster facility wasn’t excluded from this program.  Errol Stevens stated that the City of Westminster wants the facility to be managed by RTD until they decide what they would like to do.  He added that the 90-day parking notice signs were installed and until or unless the City of Westminster decides that they would like to use the facility differently, it will be managed like the other facilities.  Director Hoy stated that he would vote no on this item until he could speak to representatives from the City of Westminster.

Director Bagley commented that when this action item was tabled previously, there were questions about uniformity.  He asked the Chair if he was comfortable with the new action language.

Chair Tobiassen stated that the reason he wanted to table this item was due to the ambiguous language and he wanted to ensure that the language was clear.  He added that the new substitute main motion language answers those questions and he is comfortable with moving forward.

Director Sisk commented that he appreciates the substitute main motion, but he thinks it is still confusing.

Director Francone remarked that her understanding of this proposal to consolidate parking was designed to simplify things and set a precedent for future parking lots.  Errol Stevens stated that this action only applies to the four lines opening this year.

General Manager Genova stated that RTD does not have any ongoing discussions with any other municipalities for any other facilities.  He added that staff would only bring something to the Board if RTD was approached for an IGA.

Director Francone noted her interpretation was that staff wanted to standardize the parking policy.  She stated if other entities want to approach RTD for a different agreement, that is not standardizing the policy.  She added that she will need additional time to review this time, so she will be voting no tonight.

Director Folska said this conversation is interesting and it has evolved over the past few months.  She added that this is part of many iterations in order to get to the comprehensive plan.

Director Solano stated this is confusing, so he will be a no vote tonight.  He noted that he may change his mind by the Board meeting.

Committee Chair Anderson explained that there needs to be flexibility for the communities that spent their own money to build parking structures.

Vote on

Substitute

Main

Motion:

Motion:               Director Folska made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the August 16, 2016 Board Meeting.

Director Sisk seconded the motion.

#### 2. Motion to Amend

#### 3. IGA with Aurora concerning Iliff Station Parking Structure

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to negotiate and execute an agreement with the City of Aurora for the utilization of the Iliff Station Parking Structure consistent with the terms outlined under Discussion in this Action.

Motion:               Director Deadwyler made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the August 16, 2016 Board Meeting.

Director Folska seconded the motion.

Discussion:               Director Francone asked if RTD has a special event, is staff required to give a 60-day notice to the City of Aurora.  Errol Stevens, Manager of Parking Management, stated that the 400 parking spaces are reserved for RTD use.  He added that RTD and the City of Aurora want to ensure there is efficient use of this facility.  He explained that the City of Aurora can submit an event permit request to RTD if there is not a certain or typical use for it.

Director Sisk stated that he anticipates a lot of push back from our ridership for the inconsistency in parking fees.  He hopes that there is ample signage at the facility which informs patrons that the City of Aurora is managing that facility.

General Manager Genova indicated that there are currently two rates at the existing parking facilities.  He stated that there are a lot of different variables, but this agreement is only for three years and staff can revise this pilot program after the agreement expires.

Director Deadwyler commented that she was aware of the $3.00 fee but she did not know what the fee range was.  General Manager Genova indicated that the fee range is $3.00-$5.00.  The agreement that staff is proposing will have parameters for the minimum and maximum rates.

Director Deadwyler noted that she would like to see the entire agreement before she votes on this item.  She inquired if RTD is responsible for all of the Operations and Maintenance costs.  Errol Stevens stated that RTD will pay $100,000 annually for operations and maintenance costs.  He added that the City of Aurora will pay $135,000 on top of what RTD will be contributing to cover all of the operations and maintenance expenses.

Chair Tobiassen commented that this garage is in his district.  He noted that it is a three-year agreement, and the City of Aurora is planning to be flexible with pricing to follow demand.  He added that not all Aurora residents get the discount at RTD park-n-rides because they do not live in the district.  He stated that this is a good deal for a number of Aurora residents considering that they have already contributed to this parking facility.  He asked the Board to be flexible and let the pilot program show the Board how parking can work.

Director Solano stated that he likes the idea of a pilot study, however, this is going away from a standard parking policy and he would be voting no on this item until he has more information.

Director James commented that this appears to be a great opportunity for RTD and is also advantageous.  Errol Stevens remarked that this multi-level facility is more attractive to our patrons than a surface lot.  Director James added the enhanced facility was done at no additional cost to RTD.

Director Bagley indicated he would support this motion.  He added that out of the three pilot programs, RTD can determine which parking program is best for current and future corridors.

Director Lubow asked if staff had heard from the Aurora patrons since this will mean everyone will be charged daily.  Errol Stevens commented that people will weigh the costs and choose the best option for them.  He added that there is a lot to learn from this program.

Committee Chair Anderson stated she has been in public service for over 30 years and she has always heard that government isn’t run like a business or entrepreneurial.  She stated she would be voting for this item and expects that RTD will learn a lot about its ridership.

##### a. Delegation of Authority--Henry to Jyotsna

#### 4. Proposed Fall 2016 Service Change

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors approve the Fall 2016 Service Change package as revised and summarized in Attachment A resulting in an annualized cost of approximately $785,800 and, further, to authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is impacted by these changes.

Motion:               Director Folska made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the August 16, 2016 Board Meeting.

Director Francone seconded the motion.

#### 5. Citations For Failure To Tap Smart Media Technology

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the RTD Board approve revisions to the RTD Fare enforcement policy to issue citations to patrons that fail to comply with the tapping requirement regarding smart media technology, to include Business EcoPass, Neighborhood EcoPass, and CollegePass effective January 1, 2017.

Motion:               Chair Tobiassen made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the August 16, 2016 Board Meeting.

Director Bagley seconded the motion.

Discussion:               Steve Martingano, Transit Police Commander of Fare Enforcement, indicated that the current Business EcoPass, Neighborhood EcoPass and CollegePass fare enforcement policy was

implemented in January of 2013.  The

existing policy states that failure to tap or to select the correct service level may result in the following:

- First Offense: Rider is issued a warning.

- Second Offense: Seven-day suspension of card.

- Third Offense: Thirty-day suspension of card.

- Fourth Offense: Pass is confiscated and suspended for the remainder of the calendar year.

Steve Martingano commented that Even though the fare media is pre-paid through contractual agreements, if the patron does not adhere to the contractual instructions, the patron has violated Colorado Statute 42-4-1416 Failure to Present a Valid Transit Pass, because the fare media was not activated from being tapped to show that the fare media is in fact valid.

Director Solano stated that in the last six weeks he has taken the E and F line and has never been asked to show proof that he paid his fare, but the University of Colorado A line always has a fare inspector.  Steve Martingano stated that the University of Colorado A line has a federal requirement which requires two employees on the train at all times.  He noted that one of the employees is the RTD Security Officer.  He added that there is more light rail vehicles than commuter rail and it is difficult to get an inspector on all light rail trains.

Director Francone indicated she has seen more fare checks on the C and D lines out of Mineral Station.  She asked what staff anticipates for the violation fee collection.

Steve Martingano commented that the actual citation fees go to the counties within the district as they provide the court rooms and other legal capabilities.  He stated that staff hopes the ridership will be incentivized to tap their cards.

Director Folska commented that she appreciates the work Security does for RTD, but she stated that this recommended action is turning people who are paying customer into criminals.  She added that Business, EcoPass and College Pass holders have paid their fare and it is a very different thing than someone that is a fare evader.  She stated that for people to be penalized and criminalized because our smart technology isn’t smart enough to determine when they are coming or going is offensive.

Chair Tobiassen remarked that this is not fare evasion, but a behavioral issue.  He stated that for RTD to confiscate a pass after it has been paid for is terrible.  He suggested RTD look into behavioral modification techniques as he cannot see denying someone who has paid access to the system.

Director Sisk stated this is not the way to manage the system.  He added that RTD needs a better counting process, but this is punitive and offensive.

Director Hoy explained that while he is conflicted, he is in support of this.  He noted that he receives comments from people stating that they see people get on and off the train all the time without tapping or validating a ticket and it appears to others as those people are riding the system for free.

Director Lubow said she would vote no on this item and asked staff to rethink this plan.  She added that people need to be taught behavior modification.

Committee Chair Anderson stated that she agrees with the other Director’s arguments, but asked how does someone modify the behavior of a college student when they will not tap their cards.  She stated that if a few got a warning they would start to tap their cards.  She indicated she would be voting yes on this item.

Director James asked if RTD requires a tap off when riders exit the system.  Steve Martingano stated that RTD does not.  Director James added that he realizes why staff is recommending the change to the policy, but inquired if there was enough data to warrant the change.

General Manager Genova explained that if there is pre-paid media, staff wanted to change the policy to be consistent across the board.  He commented that there is a perception that people are not paying for their fare.  He added that the intent of this action is to have one policy to enforce and comply with.

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, stated that RTD has benchmarks for what is expected for ecopass and college pass taps.  He commented that on the bus side the taps were close to the benchmark, but on the rail side the taps were drastically less which indicated that people were not taping their cards as they boarded the trains.  He added that for a variety of reasons there were challenges with the cards and the smart readers, but that has been addressed.

Director Folska commented that staff is discussing pre-paid cards.  She said that RTD has paid $28 million to Xerox and the burden should be on them.  She added that RTD is opening five new corridors this year and this action item is not how we make friends or get people to use RTD’s system.

#### 6. Amend Contract 25FK006 - Cutaway Buses to add enhanced ADA features

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to amend contract 25FK006 in an amount not to exceed $340,000 with Master’s Transportation, a dealer for Goshen Coach, for the addition of ADA-related items to better accommodate passengers with disabilities.

It is also recommended that the Board of Directors authorize the transfer of $340,000 from the Flatiron Flyer bus procurement, the cutaway transit bus and the in-plant vehicles & equipment projects to cover the cost of the requested additional items.

Motion:               Chair Folska made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the August 16, 2016 Board Meeting.

Director Sisk seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Director Solano asked for clarification of the ADA related items.  Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, indicated that representatives from both the ADA Paratransit Advisory Committee (APAC) and the Colorado Cross Disability Coalition (CCDC) asked for modifications to the Cutaway Buses to add more handrails, hand straps, and tie downs to better accommodate disabled passengers.

Director Solano asked how the amendment price was determined.  Bruce Abel explained that staff approached the manufacturer and they provided a quote.  Staff was able to negotiate that quote down to the current amount shown.
