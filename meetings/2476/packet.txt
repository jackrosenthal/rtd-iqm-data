Committee Background
Committee Chair Francone thanked everyone for attending and let the
committee know we would be speaking to the process and setting up some
ground rules as well as reviewing materials. Barbara has prepared for us a
notebook of all materials that will be used throughout this process. Included
in your packet were the 4 approved policies used in the process of
determining and evaluating the position of General Manager. These four
policies were created as a result of the 2010 Legislative Audit. At that time
it was mandated a committee be set up for the purpose of GM oversight and
performance evaluation.

Approved Policies
Goal Setting Policy, Performance Evaluation Policy, Benchmarking Policy,
Approved Compensation Philosophy

Committee Chair Francone spoke to the approved policies that were in the
packet as the guidelines utilized in the process of evaluating the General
Manager. The goal setting is tied to the results of the Board/Senior
Leadership retreat we attended in March. GM Genova will be speaking to
those 4 priorities at the Study Session scheduled for April 26th of this
month. GM Genova made the correction that there were 3 priorities and not
4. Committee Chair Francone thanked him for the correction. Committee
Vice-Chair Bagley clarified that the Study Session was an informational
session in reviewing the GM Tactical Plan and the GM Oversight and
Performance Management Committee was charged to do an in depth review
of the tactical goals to determine how and where the tactical goals are
placed as part of the overall evaluation process. Once the details of the core
and task goals are determined, the committee will bring the
recommendations to the full Board. Committee Vice-Chair Bagley asked if
there was mutual understanding of the process. Director Anderson said this
is the way it has been completed in the past.
GM Genova said the Tactical Plan as presented provides the basis for
developing the task goals in the evaluation. Committee Vice-Chair Bagley
reiterated the core goals fall out of the job description while the tactical fall
out of the 2016 retreat for the 2017 performance evaluation. Committee
Chair Francone reminded everyone that the presentation is given in the
broadest of terms and this committee will work with and massage all of the
elements to get them into the framework of the evaluation. Committee
Vice-Chair Bagley pointed out the importance of the policies in place and the
need for the committee to fully understand their content. Committee Chair
Francone agreed that all policies are important to understand but particularly
the Compensation Philosophy which Committee Vice-Chair Bagley said has
caused some differences in the past. Committee Chair Francone reminded
the committee that these policies are the foundation of what the committee
does and is the basis of how we move forward in the evaluation. She asked
if all the committee members were in agreement with the process as
outlined and the policies that are currently in place. Not hearing any
comments she would called for a motion.
Committee Vice-Chair Bagley moved that the present methodology and
policies be continued through the 3rd quarter of 2016 in the evaluation
process and into 2017. Director Anderson seconded and the motion was
passed unanimously.


Proposed 2016-2017 General Manager Goal Setting and Evaluation Timeline
Committee Chair Francone reviewed the Goal Setting and Evaluation Timeline with
special emphasis on critical dates with the committee. Committee Vice-Chair
Packet Pg. 6

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 19, 2016 3:30 PM (Committee Reports)

As committee members we are tasked with the following 2 items: Following
through on the 2016 Performance Evaluation process of General Manager
Genova and Goal Setting and Performance Evaluation preparation for 2017.

6.A

Director Walker spoke to the tight timeframe in the fall and suggested the
committee may need additional meeting dates as the process does not allow
extended turnaround times in the decision making period. Committee Chair
Francone asked GM Genova if he had any additional comments. He responded he
is ready to move forward with 2017 Tactical Plan for the Study Session on
Tuesday, April 26th and understands the 2016 process as well.
Committee Chair Francone asked if there were any questions or was the committee
in agreement. Director Anderson reiterated that the core goals fall out of the job
description and the tactical goals are determined by this committee.
Director Menten thought the core goals need to be updated for 2017 as in the
example they are outdated and asked the committee to go to the manual section 7
to review the goals. Director Anderson spoke to the process of the General
Manager giving us the current elements that fall into each category under the core
goals. The General Manager and the committee will determine through the tactical
plan which elements will be placed under each static core goals as the elements in
advancing those goals. Director Menten said she thought what she was hearing
was that the core goals are touchable and can be changed for 2017 based on the
specifics presented by the General Manager. Committee Chair Francone said we
were probably premature in looking at this since GM Genova will be presenting the
Tactical Plan on April 26th and we would revisit the core goals at a later date.
Director Walker said as he understands the process that specific elements of the
core goals change over time.
The motion was made by Committee Vice-Chair Bagley to leave the core goals for
2017 as is and was seconded by Director Anderson and passed unanimously.


Review Performance Evaluation
Director Walker asked if any committee members would be proposing changes to
the committee much like Director Menten did last year. He feels if so, the sooner
the better in all fairness to GM Genova since he may choose different paths
depending on how his goals are structured within the evaluation process. Director
Menten said she would like to propose some changes which is why she questioned
the turnaround time in July in making that decision. Director Walker explained on
the timeline the vertical arrow to the right of the milestones indicated there would
be meetings scheduled for this committee starting in May until July in which those
decisions will be made prior to taking the formal goals to the Board on the 19th of
July. Director Anderson explained that July is the deadline and it is critical as the
decision has a direct impact on approval of the budget and we all should be
Packet Pg. 7

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 19, 2016 3:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Bagley commented that two key dates are as follows: on or before July 12th the
committee would formalize the goal setting process with GM Genova and move the
action forward for full approval of the Board on July 19th. Committee Chair
Francone went over the critical dates for the 2016 evaluation. November 1st the
GM will provide to the committee his self-assessment for 2016 performance
evaluation and on November 15th the committee discusses the possibility of a
discretionary payout. On November 22nd the GM Oversight and Performance
Management Committee invites the full Board to discuss the evaluation and payout
recommendation. Final recommendations are made on December 6th moving the
recommendation to the full Board on December 20th. Committee Chair Francone
asked if there are any questions.

6.A



Bi-Annual Board of Directors Surveys
Committee Chair Francone discussed the process of the online Survey Monkey
survey that is sent out to the Board on a bi-annual basis. It was determined in the
past that quarterly was to frequent and we were not getting valuable data. In
2014 the survey was sent in April and October, but being slightly behind this year
as a result of the General Manager Executive Search, we will prepare and send the
survey in June and October. Director Anderson mentioned it will be valuable
information to have in finalizing the 2016 GM evaluation.



Questions and Next Steps
It was requested we change the next meeting date from Thursday May 26th to
Tuesday, May 24th from 3:30 – 5:00 p.m. prior to the committee meetings.

General Manager 2017 Tactical Plans
David Genova, General Manager and CEO, reviewed a Power Point Presentation with the
Board that was included in the April 26, 2016 Study Session Agenda Packet. It covered
his proposed Tactical Plans for the Strategic Goals/Priorities established during the March
5th, 2016 RTD Board/Senior Leadership Team (SLT) Advance. These goals are meant to
drive the 2017 budget cycle. He reminded the board that the top three priorities that
came out of the Advance are:
 Fiscal Sustainability (Strategic Goal #1)
 Workforce Human Capital (Strategic Goal #2)
 State of Good Repair & Operations and Maintenance (Strategic goal #3)
General Manager Genova pointed out that a detailed write up was included in the Agenda
Packet. He explained that these items have not yet turned into SMART (Specific,
Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, Time-bound) goals and he would be developing the
tactical plan further in conjunction with the General Manager Oversight and Performance
Management Committee. He would be working with the Committee over the next few
months with the goal of presenting the tactical plan to the full Board about mid-summer.
General Manager Genova reviewed the Board and staff focus areas as follows:
Strategic Goal Number One: Fiscal Sustainability
 Building Reserves
 Discuss Impacts
 Maintain Service Levels
 Monitoring
 Live Within our Means
 Identify New Revenue Sources
Strategic Goal Number Two: Workforce/Human Capital
 Pension
 Union Negotiations
 Health and Welfare
 Morale
 Recruitment/Retention
 Training/Development
 Succession Planning

Working Conditions

General Manager Genova noted that further details could be found in the April 26, 2016
Study Session Agenda Packet. He asked if the Board had any questions or comments.
Director Bagley thanked General Manager Genova for his highlights of his Tactical Plan for
the 2017 Strategic Goals, which align to the core goals for General Manager Genova. He
shared that as the Vice-Chair of the General Manager Oversight and Performance
Management Committee he looks forward to working with General Manager Genova in the
coming months to get a more detailed plan for each of these points. He stated that he
had found the packet fairly complete and thanked General Manager Genova for his
presentation.
Director Deadwyler asked about the topic of ensuring service and accessibility. She noted
Access-a-Ride had not been included in General Manager Genova’s presentation. She
wondered if the reason for that was because Access-a-Ride was not RTD’s responsibility
and was being left up to the contractors. General Manager Genova indicated this was an
oversight as it is to be part of the plans mentioned.
Director Menten commented that General Manager Genova indicated that sales tax parity
has increased RTD’s revenue; she is hearing conflicting reports on this topic and asked for
more information. Heather Copp, Chief Financial Officer and Assistant General Manager of
Finance and Administration, stated that it has been hard to measure because it started at
the same time as retail marijuana sales as well as a bump in the economy. She said
around several million dollars a year is contributable to that parity but it is really hard to
come up with an exact number. She noted if it had been done in isolation it would have
been much easier but this time that is just staff’s best guess based on a comparative
analysis.
Director Menten noted that General Manager Genova mentioned contributions that were
made to make the Health and Welfare Trust to make it healthy. She stated that is not
how she would describe it. The contributions were really what she would call bandaging a
severe wound. General Manager Genova responded that her interpretation was correct; he

would not say it has been fixed it in its entirety but there have been some significant steps
taken to keep it solvent. He stated the Health and Welfare Trust would be one of the
items addressed during the next contract negotiations with the Union. Director Francone
thanked David for a very thorough and easy to understand presentation. She added that
she is looking forward to working with General Manager Genova as the Chair of the
General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee to flush out these
goals and turn them into SMART goals in the next month.

Strategic Budget Plan Development Process and 2017 Budget Assumptions
Jannette Scarpino, Senior Manager of Budget and Financial Analysis, reviewed a Power
Point presentation that was included in the April 26, 2016 Study Session Agenda Packet.
She reminded the Board that the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) is RTD’s six year financial
plan for the Base System that must result in a balanced budget. FasTracks expenses and
projects are included in the FasTracks Annual Program Evaluation (APE) financial plan.
She said the goal is to combine the SBP and APE into one long-range plan going forward.
Jannette Scarpino explained that staff starts with the 2016-2021 SBP capital programs as
a baseline to develop the current SBP. These projects are prioritized and evaluated using
mission statement criteria and 2017 strategic goals. She said the SBP is comprised of
operating elements (bus service, rail service, and operating and passenger facilities) and
capital elements (fleet plan and operating passenger facilities and equipment).
Jannette Scarpino noted there are several revenue and cost assumptions used in
development of the SBP which are:
Revenue Assumptions
 Sales and use tax growth rate
o 2017: CU-Leeds School of Business currently forecasts 5.6% increase over
2016
o 2018-2020: based on semi-annual forecasts from CU-Leeds School
o February 2016 collections are 1.9% over February 2015
o February 2016 collections are 3.1% below budget
 Fare Revenue
o Assume system-wide 8.0% fare revenue increase in 2016 over 2015 actual
o Fare revenue for 2017 will be established with formulation of 2017 Budget
o Per policy, Board will consider a fare rate increase every 3 years with
scheduled increases in 2019 then 2022
 Federal grants
o Based on actual 2016 appropriations
o Recognized as awarded
o Assumed to increase at rate of inflation or as identified

Packet Pg. 12

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 26, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

III.

Cost Assumptions
 Operating and maintenance costs
o Based on 2016 Amended Budget
o Costs escalated at rate of inflation
o Collective Bargaining Agreement incorporated as fixed through 2017 then
escalated at CPI
 Diesel fuel costs
o Locked at $2.23 per gallon in 2016
o Volatile commodity
o RFP for 2017 vendor contract underway
o Conservative cost assumptions and escalated at national inflation rate
 Debt service
o Interest payments on existing debt and assumed financing
 Inflation rates
o Based on Moody’s forecasts of February 2016
o Denver-Boulder inflation rate: 3.0% in 2017
o National inflation rate: 3.1% in 2017
Jannette Scarpino pointed out that there are many issues and challenges in developing the
SBP. The next steps are to review and prioritize SBP departmental requests for capital and
expense projects, develop funding strategies and calibrate ridership/fare revenue
estimates. She will be presenting the first draft of the SBP at the May Financial
Administration and Audit Committee Meeting with an update in June. Staff hopes to bring
the final SBP to the Board in July for approval so the 2017 Requested Budget process can
begin in August with adoption of the Budget in November.
Director Walker noted that ridership had been adjusted downward to 1.5% due to the
effect of the fare increase. He wondered if staff had data at the local, regional, day pass,
etc. level to show if there had been increases or decreases in fare revenue for each of
those media to offset the decrease in ridership. Jannette Scarpino responded that staff
did not break it down at that level but were just looking at an overall fare revenue increase
and ridership increase.
Director Anderson noted she had seen some information where it appeared that some
fares went up while other fares went down. She wondered if perhaps they could cancel
each other out. Jannette Scarpino stated that was a true statement. She indicated staff is
also leaning on the FasTracks expansion to provide some support to the fare revenue
estimates. She said it is a somewhat aggressive assumption but it is obtainable. Staff will
have to monitor actuals for the remainder of the year and will report back.

Director Bagley noted that the Diesel fuel lock in 2016 is $2.23 per gallon. He wondered
if staff has a sense of what it would be if we were to lock in today’s environment.
Jannette Scarpino responded saying the future market for 2017 has been somewhere
around $1.65 - $1.70. Since then gas prices have trended up a bit so she suspects that
number is slightly to the north of $1.70. General Manager Genova added that we are
expecting proposals for a fuel lock vendor by May. He explained that staff has asked for
something a little different as it is a competitive environment. The Request for Proposal
asked them to include what their lock would be for 2017 when they submit their
proposals; however, there is typically a risk premium included on top of a fuel lock as they
are hedging that prices are likely to go up. He does not believe a provider would lock in
this environment.
Director Lubow thanked staff for presenting an interesting, thorough and comprehensive
review to the Board. Director Lubow wondered if staff had thought about increasing the
contributions to the fund balances so that they would become fully funded earlier.
Jannette Scarpino responded that we could always increase the contribution. Staff
typically brings forward the SBP with a contribution of $3 million to each fund. She
pointed out that the SBP has historically been fairly tight so staff tends to leave that
contribution at the minimum $3 million to each fund. She shared that staff run a variety of
scenarios to see what the impact would be in adding more money. Heather Copp further
stated that, as was mentioned in the Tactical Plan, fund balances are one of the things
that came up in the advance. Staff is looking to build up our reserves sooner while we
are experiencing sales and use tax growth rates in the 4-5% range as that will not last.
Director Menten requested more information regarding what the fare media purchases are
pre-2016 and now. She wonders how much the day passes are being used compared to
before, what were the sales of express/regional versus the combined fare now, etc.
Director Menten commented that the first fare increase she experienced was the major
overhaul of the entire fare structure as well. She wondered when staff would start to look
at the 2019 increase. She believes it will be a lot less time than this past one but maybe
not. General Manager Genova responded that this would be quite different compared to
what we just went through as the last effort looked at the overall fare structure,
categories of fares, all of the zones on the rail system, etc. as well as looking at the rates.

Director Anderson complimented staff for the charts from Moody’s as it is great
information to have on hand. She thought it was interesting to see what the percentage
of sales tax RTD gets for different categories. She shared that in the paper today there
was a forecast that motor vehicles are not selling as well as they have in the past. She
sees that as a real jolt to RTD’s sales and use tax revenue. She thanked staff for
providing more detailed sales and use tax information as they are great reference pieces
for the Board.

6.B

Director Sisk thanked staff for the presentation. He stated that he is always interested in
efficiencies. He noted that staff puts a great deal of time into the SBP and wonders if
perhaps there is a more efficient way to keep the Board informed. He challenged staff to
think about if there was a better way to do the SBP. Heather Copp said that staff will
have to see how changes to the SBP process would fit into the long term planning as there
are plans that go out to 2040.
Chair Pro Tem Hoy thinks the most impactful comment is that sometimes we do things
because that is the way we have always done them. He does not know how Director
Sisk’s suggestion might work specifically but believes our processes are something that
should be looked at from time to time.
Director James appreciates Director Sisk’s skepticism. He agrees that just because it is
the way something has always been done is not necessarily a good reason to keep doing
it; however, as someone who does this in a different dimension, his sense is that doing it
annually is appropriate. In a six year plan staff has more confidence than in a 60 year
plan. Jannette Scarpino noted that things move pretty fast around here. She said
historically many of staff’s assumptions change rather quickly; however, she pointed out
that RTD’s business is also stabilizing. She indicated staff would take the comments into
consideration.
Director Walker thinks staff has a good idea of what our expenses are going to be but
revenue is a little more of a greased pig. Staff knows when we will need new buses but
we do not know what our revenue will be each year. He thinks it is prudent for the Board
to get updates about our expectations and making adjustments yearly. He stated as the
Board saw in 2007, the economy can change on a dime. He believes adjustments need to
be made quickly. He stated getting stuck in a rut is not always healthy but some level of
predictability is essential.

IV.

Other Matters
Chair Pro Tem Hoy thanked everyone at RTD and especially at our FasTracks Program who
made last week happen. He stated it was a monumental task, especially when thinking of
all the little pieces that came together to magically make that happen. He believes each
and every person that works for RTD should feel proud of their efforts and the
accomplishment. He noted that people were ecstatic about the opening.

Due to all the complexities it was a very long drawn out process. He explained when we
look at a general fare increase the process has less analysis and is usually less in duration.
He anticipates the process would begin in early 2018 for a 2019 fare increase.

Director Deadwyler congratulated General Manager Genova and Director Hoy for the

General Manager Genova agrees that it was a huge day and weekend. He noted we
received incredible media exposure that we could not have purchased. He thanked the
entire RTD and Denver Transit Partner teams because the opening took everyone. He
shared there was a switch and signal issue around mid-day Saturday as well as a few door
issues but overall the opening was very smooth. He indicated staff had three after action
reviews and will continue to diligently monitor performance. He noted there was also a
brief bus bridge this afternoon between 40th and Airport but overall it has been a very
positive experience. He stated he was happy to see everyone really enjoying themselves.

B. Recommended Actions

• State Legislative Liaison Services
It is recommended by the Government Relations Committee that the Board
of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into an
agreement for state legislative liaison services with Brandeberry~McKenna
Public Affairs (BBMK) to exercise a one-year option (June 30, 2016 through
June 29, 2017) to extend Contract No. 13-DX-00, at a cost of $122,000,
pursuant to the Contract Award agreement.
Motion:

Chair Tobiassen made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the May 31, 2016
Board Meeting.
Director Solano seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Sherry Ellebracht, Government Relations officer, stated that
the team at Brandeberry~McKenna Public Affairs (BBMK)
does a fantastic job representing RTD at the State Capitol.
BBMK has a proven record at being very effective in ensuring
the bills RTD needs are passed. She noted that included in the
May 10, 2015 Government Relations Committee Agenda
Packet there was a summary report from BBMK outlining all
the work they have done over the years for RTD. She does
not think it is as comprehensive as what BBMK actually does
but provides a good overview. She encouraged the Board
renew the contract with BBMK.

Jenifer Brandeberry, BBMK, stated that the BBMK team looks
forward to continuing to represent RTD before the General
Assembly. She said it has been an honor to represent RTD
and something her staff take a lot of pride in. She believes
the partnership they have had with RTD staff and Board
members has allowed BBMK to have a great amount of
success at the State Capital.

Committee Vice-Chair Francone shared that she has enjoyed
working closely with the staff at BBMK. She recognized how
well they keep the Board posted on upcoming legislation. She
said their hard work is much appreciated. BBMK is always
very well prepared and look out for RTD’s interests. She also
thanked Sherry Ellebracht for her diligence.

C. Updates

• Local Update - CRL Associates
Sherry Ellebracht, Government Relations Officer, apologized on behalf of
Roger Sherman for his absence as he was traveling. She indicated that the
report was included in the May 10, 2016 Government Relations Committee
Agenda Packet. She said she also sent additional information in relation to
the various Colorado contractor group’s funding proposals.
Sherry Ellebracht stated Colorado Contractors Association, Associated
General Contractors of Colorado, the Colorado Construction Industry
Coalition, and Move Colorado (contractor groups) submitted ten (10) ballot
initiative titles. The contractor groups will now have to decide which one of
these they will actually take to a ballot election in November, 2016, if any.
Sherry Ellebracht indicated that the Metro Mayors Caucus (MMC) did not

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 10, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Lubow expressed her gratitude to the staff of BBMK
for the work they have done on behalf of RTD. She said it has
been a pleasure working with them.

6.C

The Metro Mayors Caucus (MMC) was very adamant that transit needed to
be funded, which is a positive for RTD. Staff will continue to monitor the
progress of the ballot initiatives as they move forward. Jenifer Brandeberry
added that they will know soon how the ballot will look. She said there had
been several transportation funding bills that died and there has been
frustration with the lack of ability to pass anything at the State level to fund
transportation. She indicated the contractor groups would need to do
polling to determine what is passable and will garner enough revenue to
make it worthwhile.
Director Lubow wondered if the contractor groups would move forward
without an endorsement from the MMC. Sherry Ellebracht responded that it
will depend on the polling and the level of support they see. As it is a sales
tax and not something like a gas tax, the polling results may show some
push back. She said it also depends on who will be willing to fund a
campaign that could cost millions of dollars for something that might not be
very popular.
Director Anderson thinks one of the good reasons that the MMC have
refused to look at this initiative is because it would preempt local
governments from raising sales tax on their own for transportation purposes.
In the city of Arvada there are some transportation needs that cannot be
met under the State and the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) money. If the
contractor group’s initiative passes, then it would preempt the cities from
having their own sales tax for transportation needs. Sherry Ellebracht
agreed that Director Anderson makes a good point as some of these cities
were very concerned with an additional sales tax that would be bumping up
taxes close to 10% in their communities. Some of the cities would like to
do their own local ballot for funding transportation and once you get to a
10% sales tax that is pretty steep.

• State Update - Brandeberry - McKenna
Jenifer Brandeberry expressed that the end of the legislative session is about
thirty (30) hours away. She said she is happy to report that RTD will finish
up the session in very fine shape. She wanted to focus on three highlights

Packet Pg. 20

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 10, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

take a formal position; however, at the work session held on May 2 the
consensus was not to support any of the proposals as currently written.
The three primary concerns cited for the MMC’s decision are:
 Lack of funds dedicated to transit
 Concern the statewide tax increase could preclude cities from raising
local sales taxes for needed infrastructure
 The inequitable distribution of funds

that Brandeberry~McKenna Public Affairs (BBMK) have spent a lot of time
on for RTD this year:
 House Bill 16-1008 was passed allowing RTD to operate buses along
the shoulder of US 36.
 Senate Bill 16-123 dealt with the requirement of transponders for
High Occupancy Vehicles to use the US 36 express lanes that
morphed into a larger conversation about the High Performance
Enterprise (HPTE) and public/private partnerships. This bill died in the
House Transportation Committee.
 House Bill 16-1325 would have required CDOT to post information
about caucus and election dates on variable message signs. When it
became clear that they were statutorily prohibited from doing that
there was an amendment quickly offered that would have required
RTD to post the messaging. This bill died after quick action by RTD
staff and Directors after explaining how it would be cost prohibitive.
Julie McKenna, BBMK, shared with the Board information on Senate Bill 16194, which was introduced by the City of Broomfield and has now been
passed in the Senate Transportation Committee. The bill creates the
“Regional Transportation Development Act,” which allows a city, county,
town or local government to apply to the state transportation commission
for approval of a regional transportation development project. SB16-194 as
written would not take any funds from RTD. It allows creation of new
“authorities” to build highway or transit projects. These authorities could be
within the District but the funding is state sales tax increment finance, plus
what other public bodies would want to contribute. She said this bill did die
but will probably continue to be discussed.
Julie McKenna indicated that affordable housing and construction defects
continued to be an important topic but there were a number of bills that did
not go forward; however, these are topics that are not going away. She
said there are still several big issues that are percolating that BBMK will
continue to monitor. As they stand they do not impact RTD but it is
important to monitor if any amendments are made.
Julie McKenna thanked the Board for renewing BBMK’s contract. She said it
has been an honor to represent RTD.

• Federal Update - Squire Patton Boggs
Mike Dino, Squire Patton Boggs, shared that congress resumed their session
earlier today whereas the Senate resumed last night. There are
approximately 3 weeks before the Memorial Day holiday break. He noted
they will be working throughout the summer; however, due to the
Presidential campaigns productivity might suffer. He said over the next
three weeks the Senate and House will try to get a budget and

Mike Dino commented that RTD will be submitting a Transportation
Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) grant proposal in the
range of $13 million for the state of good repair and operational
improvements for the Central corridor. He noted that Directors briefed the
delegation on this during the APTA Legislative Conference.
Mike Dino shared that General Manager Genova will be participating in a US
Department of Transportation (DOT) webinar on the finance plan and project
development for the Eagle P3 project. He also shared that last week Director
Francone General Manager Genova and he went out to the National
Renewable Energy Labs (NREL) to talk about the Department of Commerce’s
i6 Challenge Grant. This grant is concentrated on regional innovation
strategies that bring different groups together and focuses on economic
development, jobs and business opportunities. The meeting was to discuss
strategies to partner with NREL and other businesses that may be eligible for
this grant.
Director Menten asked about receiving a copy of the TIGER grant application
for $13 million. She wondered if it would include specifics of what the
funds would cover. General Manager Genova responded that he would
forward a copy to Director Menten. He explained that the application would
detail the state of good repair work and installing a pocket track that would
be part of the Central Rail extension.
Committee Vice-Chair Francone thanked Mike Dino for accompanying
General Manager Genova and herself to the NREL meeting. She thinks the
i6 Grant is an opportunity for RTD to pursue a revenue stream in the future.
Mike Dino added that the NREL tour they took of the Research and
Development facility highlighted advantages to renewable energy or
alternative energy modes that could be advantageous to RTD.

D. Other Matters
Director Bagley shared that he was late this evening as he attended a going away
reception for Jim Gunning, Mayor of Lone Tree. Director Bagley has worked
Packet Pg. 22

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 10, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

appropriations passed. The Senate has passed their transportation
appropriations and kept most programs at current funding levels or higher.
One of the things they have improved upon is the Transportation Investment
Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) grant program. Mike Dino noted the
Senate appropriations also funded the New Starts Grant and allocated $150
million for the Eagle P3 project. He indicated RTD asked for $167 million to
make-up from a previous year shortfall, which we will eventually get. He
pointed out that $199 million was authorized for positive train control grants
which might present some opportunities for RTD.

6.C

Director Bagley added that he and Chair Tobiassen attended the State of
Downtown Denver Event today that was hosted by the Downtown Denver
Partnership, Inc. Director Bagley requested the Board members read the 2016 State
of Downtown Denver Report. He thinks it is important to understand that the health
of Denver makes everything else viable. This report is a fantastic summary of
extraordinary developments that have been happening in Denver that benefit the
entire region. Director Bagley further added that although he did not attend the
University of Colorado A Line inaugural ride, he did attend the reception before the
official public opening. Director Bagley congratulated all the staff and said it has
been a fantastic opportunity for the members of the Board to be involved with the
entire Eagle P3 project. He noted three Board members, Director Bill James, Chair
Tom Tobiassen and himself, have been here for the entire project. This FasTracks
project is what makes this area one of the top regions in the entire country.
Director Lasater complimented General Manager Genova for how he handled the
hecklers during his speech at the University of Colorado A Line opening. The
hecklers made a disruptive scene but General Manager Genova kept his composure
and continued on with his speech. Director Lasater also shared that he had
attended the groundbreaking for the Southeast Rail extension and it was well
attended. Construction will start on May 16th and hopefully the extension will be
opened at the proposed March 2019 timeframe.
Director Bagley noted there had been a shakeup at APTA with Michael Melaniphy
stepping down as President and CEO after the Metropolitan Transit Agency of New
York cancelled their APTA membership. He asked General Manager Genova if he
could speak about what has been happening. General Manager Genova responded
that for the last few years New York City’s MTA was making rumblings about
pulling out of APTA. Their main reason being that agency dues are determined by
how large the agency is and their dues were around $400,000 a year. MTA felt
that the representation they received was not worth the financial contribution.
Shortly after it was announced that MTA was no longer going to be a part of
APTA, Michael Melaniphy resigned. General Manager Genova recognized that
APTA is currently in the process of making changes, but he does not know what
those changes will be. He added that APTA continues to be a great body for RTD
and the transportation industry as a whole. He believes they provide a valuable
service and are a good organization and he is interested to see what direction they
take the agency to next.

alongside Mayor Gunning for the last seven and half years and at one time had
pieces of Lone Tree in his District. He said he has requested that General Manager
Genova write a letter congratulating him on his eight year term. Director Bagley
referred to Mayor Gunning as being a leader of the Metro Mayors Caucus and a
champion of the Southeast corridor extension.

6.C

Director Anderson stated that she had attended the APTA Board Meeting prior to
the Transit Board Member Seminar in San Antonio. She said she is looking forward
to renewed efforts on the part of APTA and its many different members to continue
to make it a valuable agency to represent all of the transit associations throughout
the whole of the United States.
Committee Vice-Chair Francone thanked Director Bagley for representing RTD at
Mayor Gunning’s farewell.

B. Recommended Actions

• RTD Citizens Advisory Committee Appointments
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee and the
Nominating Committee for the RTD Citizens Advisory Committee of the
Regional Transportation District (RTD) that the RTD Board of Directors
reappoint one member of the Committee to an additional three-year term and
appoint five new members to the Committee to a three-year term.
Motion:

Director Tobiassen made the motion to move
this item to the full Board at the May 31, 2016
Board Meeting.
Director Walker seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager of Communications,
shared with the Board some of the highlights regarding the
RTD Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) Appointments. On
February 18, 2016, recruitment for citizens interested in
serving was publicly advertised through the RTD and
FasTracks Web sites, media releases, local publications and
stakeholder e-mail distributions. Applicants were asked to
submit a one-page letter stating their interest in serving on the
CAC along with specific qualifications, highlights of related
experience and expertise, and a resume if available. A total of
45 applications were received by the March 31, 2016
deadline.
Two of the current serving members were eligible for
reappointment, of which one member committed to serve an

additional three year term. Following review of the application
materials, the nominating committee interviewed nine finalists.
The nominating committee came to a consensus on the
selection of the nominees for the CAC.

Director Lubow stated she was very impressed by the quality
of candidates that applied for the CAC and congratulated
Scott Reed and his team for their public outreach that
generated applicants with such a high level of expertise and
interest.
Director Walker said he was impressed with the breadth of
background of the candidates and that the appointees have
great qualifications.
Director Bagley thanked the nominating committee for
appointing someone from District H for the first time. Director
Hoy pointed out that there is no requirement that every
District has a CAC representative, but during the process it is
one of the aspects considered.

• Contract Amendment for the Westminster Park and Ride Pedestrian Bridge
Painting & Rehabilitation
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into a
construction contract amendment with TMI Coatings, Inc. in the amount of
$390,595.81. This Contract Amendment to the Westminster Park-N-Ride
(PnR) Pedestrian Bridge Painting & Rehabilitation Project (Contract No.
16DP001) is for the restoration of the adjoining access ramps to the
pedestrian bridge over US36 at the RTD US36 Sheridan Bus Rapid Transit
(BRT) Station. With this amendment, the total contract value would be
$839,283.74

topics agency-wide.

6.D

Motion:

Director Tobiassen made the motion to move
this item to the full Board at the May 31, 2016
Board Meeting.

Discussion:

Henry Stopplecamp, Acting Assistant General Manager of
Capital Programs, introduced Cory Granrud, Manager of ParkN-Ride Design, and Michael Peters, Engineer IV, who were
with him this evening. He explained that staff was already
working on the pedestrian bridge through the Strategic Budget
Plan (SBP) process. He noted maintenance and rehabilitation
is an ongoing process for all RTD structures across the
system. RTD received a request from the US36 Corridor to do
some more work on the pedestrian bridge, which is why staff
is recommending the contract amendment.
Cory Granrud pointed out that the US36 & Sheridan Bus Rapid
Transit (BRT) Station Pedestrian Bridge over US36 was
constructed in 1995. This bridge is now showing signs of rust
and concrete damage that require rehabilitation. Staff issued
an Invitation for Bid (IFB) last year regarding the Pedestrian
Bridge painting and repairs but the quotes came in higher than
anticipated. He explained that staff restructured the bid and
put it out this year as a Request for Proposals (RFP) in order to
receive more thorough responses from more qualified
contractors submitting proposals. Staff accepted proposals
on March 25, 2016 from three prime contractors:
o Gonzales Custom Painting, Inc.
o TMI Coatings, Inc.
o RMA Group, Inc.
On April 6, 2016 a final evaluation and recommendation
meeting occurred where it was recommended by the technical
evaluation committee that the most technically qualified, and
mid-range cost proposal submitted that is within the project
budget, was contractor TMI Coatings, Inc. (TMI). A base bid
of approximately $450,000 was made and the contract
duration is 180 calendar days. The base bid contract will
restore the bridge as follows:
1. Prepare and paint steel members dark grey
2. Replace clear Lexan side panels
3. Remove chain link fence
4. Patch and coat concrete decks with a skid resistant
material

6.D

Cory Granrud stated this contract amendment will utilize
currently budgeted US36 BRT Local Expense funds.
Director Hoy shared that he was at US36 & Sheridan Bus
Rapid Transit Station when RTD began the Flatiron Flyer
service. The constituents were, for the most, part happy with
the service and ridership numbers have shown an increase in
that area since the introduction of the BRT system. He said
the only complaints he really heard were in regards to the
Pedestrian Bridge. After personally reviewing the bridge in
follow up to the complaints he noticed that the bridge was in
need of repair, especially with the increased volume of
customers using this bridge now due to the change in our
service Director Hoy stated he believes this project is
necessary.
Director Archuleta asked about the actual pricing submitted by
all three contractors. Cory Granrud responded that as far as
costs, TMI Coatings, Inc. came in the middle of the other two
but he did not have specific dollar amounts he could share
with Director Archuleta at this time. He pointed out that TMI
rated the highest during the technical evaluation for
knowledge and experience. He indicated TMI rates quite a bit
higher than the other two in these categories.

B. Recommended Actions

• Pass Program Working Group
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the
Board of Directors approves and adopts the Pass Program Working Group
objective, commitments and guiding principles.
Motion:

Director Lasater made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the May 31, 2016
Board Meeting.
Chair Tobiassen seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager of Planning, said he
had Michael Washington, Title VI Manager, with him this
evening. He explained that the purpose of this
recommendation was to set the Pass Program Working
Group’s objective, commitments and guiding principles. He
stated this is a spate discussion from those that staff has been
having with Mile High Connects and the Affordable Fare Task
Force. The Pass Program Working Group (Working Group) will
be focused on RTD’s existing pass programs. He indicated the
dialog with the Affordable Fare Task force has continued and
staff will be briefing the Board on that status in the near
future.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 10, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Anderson participated via phone. Director Sisk arrived late and Director Lasater
left early. Directors Deadwyler and Folska were absent.

Michael Washington reviewed a Power Point presentation with
the Board that is available in the May 10, 2016 Planning and
Development Committee Agenda Packet. He reminded the
Board that the Working Group came at the request of the
Board when the EcoPass pricing changes were made in
September of 2015. He stated the objective of the Working
Group is to improve RTD’s pass programs to better serve
customers of the District. To achieve this objective, the
Working Group will fulfill the following commitments: (1)
revisit and refine goals for each individual pass program, (2)
refine pricing and administration of each pass program, and (3)
recommend pass program policy revisions to the Board of
Directors.
Michael Washington outlined the Guiding Principles for the
Working Group as follows:
 Cost Effective Administration
 Equitable Access
 Improve Customer Convenience
 Increase Ridership
 Meet Strategic Budget Plan Revenue Targets
 Promote Greater Brand Loyalty
 Provide RTD Revenue Certainty
 Simplify Passenger-Operator Interaction
Michael Washington indicated after the Board approval of the
objective, commitments and guiding principles, staff hopes to
begin Working Group interviews over the summer with
initiation of Stakeholder Meetings in the fall.
Director Lubow noted that she thinks it is great that the
Working Group is being created. She remembered seeing that
this evaluation would be a fairly long process as we acquire
data from Smart Cards and asked if that was accurate.
Michael Washington stated the Working Group would begin
meeting in the fall and continue throughout 2017.
Director Lubow stressed the importance of Title VI and equity
issues. She stated it is extremely important to make sure
everyone is treated fairly. She hopes people from the
Affordable Fares Task Force and low income community will
be incorporated into this Working Group.

6.E

Director Bagley recognized that the purpose of this discussion
is not a focus on specific pass programs, but as he is receiving
many questions, he wonders about the availability of the
Neighborhood and Community EcoPass programs in other
locations besides Boulder. It is his understanding that these
programs are only available in Boulder. Michael Washington
stated that was not correct. Currently the apartment complex
near the University Station participates in the Neighborhood
EcoPass Program. He said additionally, there were more
communities participating but have since dropped out;
however, staff has also heard concern about being eligible to
participate in those programs so it is something the Working
Group will address. Director Bagley believes it needs to be
more robustly available because 99.9% of the program is
focused on Boulder.
Committee Chair James asked if it was a correct statement
that the Working Group will be comprehensive enough to visit
the EcoPasses and their functionality, cost effectiveness, etc.
Michael Washington said that was absolutely correct.
Director Menten noted that some time ago she suggested
putting stickers on light rail vehicles informing riders that they
need to tap their Smart Cards. She wondered if anything
further had been done with that idea as people are not tapping
like they should. She stated without taps RTD does not have
accurate ridership data. Michael Washington said one of the
things the Working Group would be looking at was fare
enforcement. General Manager Genova explained that staff’s
collective thought is that we need to work on methods to get
people to tap before they get to the train. If riders see the
stickers as they are boarding the train they are not going to go
back to tap. Director Menten believes it is still an inexpensive
way to remind riders to tap.
Director Menten asked how many trains have automatic
passenger counters (APC). General Manager Genova indicated
40 out of 172 trains currently have APC.
Director Menten asked for more details about what was meant
by promoting greater brand loyalty as a guiding principle.
Michael Washington explained that many of the pass programs
afford riders some savings if they use the pass at a higher
frequency. He believes it is important for the passengers to
see this benefit and hopefully become more loyal to RTD.

Director Francone stated she would be looking for real
ridership data when it came to evaluation of the pass program
pricing. She shared that she has received comments from
several universities who were considering offering the
CollegePasses for the summer but were very disappointed to
learn we did not have ridership data. She acknowledged there
is an issue with data collection but thinks it is key for the
Working Group to move forward.
Chair Tobiassen asked staff how they plan to ensure a diverse
composition for the Working Group so the stakeholders are not
all from Boulder. He wondered how they will reach riders that
are not currently represented through the EcoPass programs
such as those along the Colfax corridor. Michael Washington
stated that staff would be looking for a diverse geographic
representation as well as a diverse group of existing and
potential EcoPass customers.
Chair Tobiassen shared he was recently in Amsterdam and got
to ride their public transportation system. He pointed out that
on their system riders need to tap on and tap off. He said if a
rider forgets to tap off 6 times the card is disabled. He
commented that the price of the day pass was pretty good
compared to ours. Michael Washington indicated the Working
Group would be looking at different enforcement options and
considering the tradeoffs of each to determine if changes need
to be made.
Director Hoy pointed out that the EcoPass is predominately
focused on large employers. His understanding is that 80% of
the employers in Colorado have around 15 employees. He
does not believe RTD reaches out to small employers. He
wonders if there is any potential for aggregating employers
based on industry, business association, etc. to reach
companies that could not qualify on their own. General
Manager Genova stated there are employers of all different
sizes that participate in the program.
Packet Pg. 35

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 10, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Francone said she was pleased to see this review of
the pass programs. She commented that RTD can have the
greatest pass program in the world, but if no one knows about
it, it is not going to be very effective. She would like to see a
concerted marketing and public information effort to ensure
people know about these programs.

General Manager Genova shared that staff has been having
ongoing meetings with various individuals at DIA about making
the EcoPass available to all employees. He noted there are a
lot of complexities to this, especially on the airport side. He
said staff has also been approached by Boulder County about
doing a county wide EcoPass and wondered how it might be
priced. He noted while that is a short question it is very
complicated to come up with an answer and staff is currently
analyzing how that might work. He said the City of Lafayette
has asked staff to consider something similar as well as
something comparable to the fare buy-up in Longmont. He
stated staff gets many different questions about how pass
programs could work in different ways so it is something that
needs to be considered moving forward.
Committee Chair James noted that all methodologies are on
the table at least for examination. General Manager Genova
stated that was correct if it was an existing pass program.
The Working Group will not be looking at new forms of
passes.
Director Walker shared that he has participated in three of the
pass programs offered by RTD. He noted many of the guiding
principles focused on the customer; however, in his experience
part of the success of the pass programs will fall on the
employers to promote them as well. He has worked for one
employer that had very high ridership while another employer
did not. He explained that the employer with high ridership
really encouraged participation.
Director Bagley believes any information garnered in
considering EcoPasses for Boulder County and the City of
Lafayette should also be made available to every county, local
government, etc. within the District so they can understand
what it would take should they want to do an EcoPass
program. He believes this would be received very well by our
jurisdictions.
Director Anderson agreed with Director Bagley that this
information should be made available to everyone. She noted
that the City of Arvada is very interested in EcoPasses with
the upcoming Gold Line opening. She wants this to be a fair
and open discussion and hopes staff will find a way to be
more inclusive of all communities.

• Regional Air Quality Council (RAQC) Grant Summary
Ignacio Correa-Ortiz, Senior Architect, reviewed a Power Point presentation
with the Board that is available in the May 10, 2016 Planning and
Development Committee Meeting Agenda Packet. He shared with the Board
that in 2014 RTD was awarded a Regional Air Quality Council (RAQC) Grant
for the purchase of Plugin Hybrid-Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) and Electric
Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE). Through direction from the Senior
Leadership Team a pilot program was created to establish a baseline for
EVSE usage at the Central Park Park-n-Ride (Central Park) as well as to
incorporate two PHEVs and one EVSE at the Elati Light Rail Facility. As part
of the pilot at Central Park, there would be no changes to the Parking
Management Plan, no additional parking fees and no electricity resale. He
said staff hopes to use the pilot program to make recommendations to the
Board for future policy approval.
Ignacio Correa-Ortiz noted there were 410,000 PHEVs sold between 2008
and 2015 with the United States representing 33% of the global stock. He
indicated as PHEVs become more popular RTD will see a demand for
charging stations at our Park-n-Rides. The goal of the pilot program is to
develop a policy that makes sense for RTD to address this need.
Director Archuleta inquired if there was a universal standard for the plug-in
interface. Ignacio Correa-Ortiz explained there were two types of plugs.
One is called the universal plug and the other type is specific to Tesla
vehicles; however, Tesla also includes an adapter that will fit into the
universal plug.
Director Francone asked for the amount of the grant. Ignacio Correa-Ortiz
stated it was a little under $30K.
Director Francone wondered why staff did not plan to resell the electricity at
the charging stations. Henry Stopplecamp explained that the projected cost
of the electricity was only $2K per year. Putting in the infrastructure for

credit card processing would end up costing more than $2K. He said after
the pilot program staff would determine what it would entail to charge for
electricity and how to structure the pricing.

Director Lubow expressed that this pilot program was very appealing to her.
She is very glad RTD is involved in trying to help this emerging technology.
Chair Tobiassen noted there are two spots for charging. He wondered how
it was determined who gets to uses the spaces. Ignacio Correa-Ortiz stated
it was on a first-come-first-served basis. There will be signs indicating that
there is a time limit for using the spots of 10 hours. He said in Los Angeles
they have found the average car is plugged in for 4.5 hours. Chair
Tobiassen expressed concern about this policy. He wonders what someone
will do if they have driven to the station expecting to plug-in and it is not
available. He suggested that perhaps in lieu of charging for electricity we
charge $45 per month, similar to our other reserved spaces. Henry
Stopplecamp pointed out that would provide charging for just a few
individuals within the District. The goal of the pilot program is to see how
the public uses the plug-ins on a wider scale.
Chair Tobiassen wondered what happens if a non-PHEV parks in the spots.
Henry Stopplecamp indicated people would be encouraged not to do that.
Ignacio Correa-Ortiz explained that was one of the reasons the pilot program
was implemented. It is staff’s hope that there will be enough information
gathered during the pilot to develop a parking management plan for the
charging stations. Chair Tobiassen commented that he already receives
complaints about the reserved parking space program and worries we are
just muddying the water more with the charging stations.
Director Sisk wondered how the location for the charging stations was
chosen. He thinks it would make sense to have them where there are the
most PHEVs in the District and wonders where that might be. Henry
Stopplecamp explained that the Central Park Park-n-Ride is brand new so it
was easy to put in the necessary infrastructure for a low dollar value. He
said it would be very expensive to put in the infrastructure in an existing
Park-n-Ride. Ignacio Correa-Ortiz noted that the Stapleton area is also a bit
of a desert for charging stations.
Director Menten wondered if it will be possible to measure how many
Packet Pg. 38

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 10, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Francone inquired as to the number of PHEVs in Colorado. Ignacio
Correa-Ortiz stated he did not have an exact number. The most prolific state
is California, then Oregon, then Washington. Colorado is very close behind
Washington and there are many charging stations currently throughout the
district.

6.E

Director Hoy expressed concern that it will be hard to begin charging for
something that was initially given away. He wondered how staff plans to
deal with users who plug in and then go to work all day. He does not see
any incentive for these users to move their vehicles unless they are charged
a per-hour fee. He said there will be all sorts of problems that will need to
be ironed out but this seems like an obvious one. Ignacio Correa-Ortiz
stated Director Hoy has hit the nail on the head and this is one of the
reasons staff plans to come up with a recommendation for an hourly charge.
He believes this will be an issue that comes up during the pilot program.
Henry Stopplecamp commented that another goal of the pilot program is to
look at the behavior patterns of our patrons. After the pilot program if staff
cannot find solutions to the problems RTD is not out a lot of money and we
will have saved money on our own fleet so it is really a win-win.
Chair Tobiassen suggested that, as the program moves forward, staff
considers charging stations for electric bikes and scooters.
Director Menten noted the RAQC grant requires a five year duration. She
wondered if that means the pilot program had to continue for five years.
Henry Stopplecamp explained that RTD just needed to use the charging
stations for five years but there was no stipulation as to where we had to
put them. If the pilot program is deemed unsuccessful the charging stations
could be moved to another RTD facility.
Director Menten asked if the RAQC grant restricted RTD from charging for
electricity. Henry Stopplecamp stated it did not.
Committee Chair James commented that this pilot program suggests PHEVs
are the next big thing; however, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory
(NREL) is experimenting with hydrogen fuel cells, so perhaps that will be the
next big thing.

D. Other Matters
General Manager Genova shared that Ignacio Correa-Ortiz was just appointed to the
Denver Planning Board. He said he was looking forward to Ignacio’s service in this
role. Committee Chair James congratulated Ignacio on his appointment.
Packet Pg. 39

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 10, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

different, unique vehicles use the charging stations. Ignacio Correa-Ortiz
stated there would be license plate recognition technology that will identify
individual users, the length of time parked at the charging station and how
much electricity they receive. Each user has a key fob or card registered to
them to be able to get electricity. Director Menten noted that means there
is the opportunity to charge people to use the charging stations. Ignacio
Correa-Ortiz stated that was correct.

6.E

Committee Chair James shared that recently the Rocky Mountain Institute had a
similar competition with Denver and Austin as finalists. He does not think Austin
looks very good because of a recent voter action causing Uber and Lyft to say they
were no longer going to operate there. He said it is easy to be optimistic about the
possibility that Denver will compete very well.
Director Archuleta said he recently attended a meeting in Sunnyside and the
commuters were very unhappy that the B-Line would not stop at the Elati Station.
Bill Van Meter explained that the Elati station would be served by much more
frequent service from the G-Line. He stated current models do not show a demand
for that connection until the line gets extended further north.
Director Francone thanked Director Menten, Henry Stopplecamp, Terry Emmons
and their staff for attending a meeting with Jeffco County Commissioner Rosier
about concerns over traffic issues that were created by the W-Line. She said it
was quite clear during the meeting that it was not an RTD issue but appreciated
staff’s professionalism.

Bill Van Meter reminded the Board that Denver is one of seven finalists for the
Smart City Challenge. The United States Department of Transportation (USDOT)
has pledged up to $40 million to help one city define what it means to be a “Smart
City” and become the country’s first city to fully integrate innovative technologies
such as self-driving cars, connected vehicles and smart sensors, into their
transportation network. He shared that Denver is taking the lead on the project and
RTD staff is supporting their efforts. He indicated RTD would benefit from some of
the funds if Denver is successful. He said applications are due at the end of the
month and he expects the USDOT to select the winner in late summer.

Overview of GM Goal Setting/Performance Evaluation
Committee Chair Francone mentioned the committee had received the initial performance
appraisal from Dave Genova in the packet and asked GM Genova to speak to the in Goals.
He indicated he only made 2 minor changes and will outline those changes as he moves
through the goals.


Core Goal #1 - Successful Delivery of Transit Services: Attain 80% performance
measures
GM Genova outlined what adjustments he had made to the goal giving the example
of taking Smart Card out as that project was scheduled to complete in 2016.
Director Anderson said this past week the University of Colorado A-Line was
problematic and she has a deep concern in managing Denver Transit Partners and
wonders if managing DTP should be reflected in this goal. GM Genova proposed to
add a point on managing DTP as he feels it appropriate and thanked Director

Anderson for her observation. Director Bagley asked if this was the appropriate
place to put this addition.



Core Goal #2 - Strong & Ethical Leadership Articulates vision, forms cohesive team,
regular team-building sessions, builds and maintains effective executive team, and
handles conflict
GM Genova has made no changes to this goal from last year and gave examples of
speaking engagements and 2 national webinars, internal and external
communications that he has been engaged in on an on-going basis in leadership
outreach. Committee Chair Francone also added GM Genova would give additional
examples of how he would outline the achievements to the Board and at that point
the Board would make a determination based on the criteria stated in the goal.
Director Bagley said he would accept that as a parameter.
Director Menten said the goal also speaks to team building and an in-house
employee survey would be a helpful indicator as to how the employees view the
leadership. She stated that when directors engaged in the employee outreach in the
GM search process they received valuable insight that might be considered. She
also stated the results of an employee survey should tie into the achieved and
exceed in this goal. GM Genova stated that finding a baseline and what would be
an acceptable percentage could be difficult and cautions that employee perception
may not be within his control and said this could be addressed in task goal number
2. Dave Genova spoke to employee appreciation and what activities had recently
been proposed and asked if he could bring this back to the committee in the
“exceeds expectation” category. Director Menten would like it addressed in some
manner either here or in the task goal and asked about the performance
management program. GM Genova said this would be a continuous improvement
for employee evaluation.
Director Anderson thinks getting the temperature in a different way like showing an
increase in promotions and is measureable but does not pit the employees against
the General Manager. Chair Tobiassen said there are processes and procedures to
determine best practices in the appraisal practices for other executives realizing you
would need a baseline. GM Genova said this could be internal and external and one
example would be a 360 review the supervisor utilizes this as an additional tool in
the evaluation. Director Walker said he is afraid we would on only get a snapshot
and the idea of a survey and he is not comfortable for the GM to be evaluated
through a survey. It is important to know how the employees feel but not to
evaluate against the GM.

Director Bagley asked for an interpretation of the comments in the “exceed
expectations” section and asked for clarity of the stated goals. Committee Chair
Francone asked how he would define “outstanding and noteworthy service” and
that it should be more clearly defined. GM Genova gave an example of the 2015
Bronco’s parade which was a record day for ridership. Director Walker said that
example was objective as some constituents were happy and others did not have a
good experience. Director Bagley said when it comes down to the final review GM
Genova would outline each of the services and how each goal was reached. He also
made the comment that these goals are agency wide goals under Dave Genova’s
leadership and administration.



Core Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management Oversees operating and FasTracks
budgets, ensures compliance with local, state, and federal reporting, and
development of financing plans for future projects.
GM Genova said he has made no changes from last year’s criteria. Committee Chair
Francone had questions about FasTracks and Operations budget and asked if GM
Genova would clarity structure and separation of those budgets. GM outlined that
the structure of the budget would stay the same since we still have FasTracks
corridors to finish and the capital and operations budgets still require separation.
Committee Chair Francone thanked GM Genova for the clarification.



Core Goal #4 Ensures Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO)/Affirmative Action
(AA)/Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE)/Small Business Enterprise (SBE).
Director Menten asked when the Triennial review was done through FTA. GM
Genova said he did not recall when the last review was completed but stated it was
a full review of everything under the FTA umbrella. He said he would check for the
date of the last review and let the committee know. He also stated the areas of
emphasis depend on the FTA issues at the time and that he know the FTA utilizes
and outside contract for its audits. Director Bagley asked if RTD paid for the audit.
GM Genova said he was not sure who pays for the audit and would get back to the
committee with that information.
Director Menten would like to see under “exceed expectations” the addition of some
language that would reflect structure strongly encouraging graduation from the
SBE/DBE program. GM Genova said he has some thoughts surrounding an incentive
program or awards ceremony in recognition of those companies that have utilized
the program as it was intended in reaching graduation and would encourage
graduation to all participants. In speaking to some of the teams some are interested
in graduating and other want to stay in the program for continued work. GM
Genova said he would make the requested changes for committee review. Director
Bagley requested GM Genova to use a redline format for the changes.

Goal #5 – Effective Communications & Community Outreach: Keeps Board
informed, periodically meets with Board members, delivers presentations in local and
national venues, and continues Public Information/Public Relations planning and
implementation.
GM Genova outlined the changes he made from last year’s goal from develop the
2016 FasTracks and Public Information plans to continuing and implementing on a
greater scale including FasTracks and Operations district wide. Director Anderson
added this fits into the goals outlined in the March advance. Director Bagley
commented that the “exceeds expectation” category would need to include some
examples. Director Walker confirmed that relevant articles and national recognition
would be valuable as elements of this goal.

GM Genova again said it would be in the “exceeded expectation” category and it is
also hard to get full participation. Committee Chair Francone says she understands
the methodology behind the surveys and is not sure if it is appropriate in this
instance and there are many different tools that could be utilized. Director Bagley
gave an overview of what GM Genova would bring back to the committee. Director
Anderson mentioned that sometime in 2017 there would be some discussion
regarding the CBA and that during those times evaluations of GM would not be
appropriate.

6.F

Task Goal # 1 Fiscal Sustainability.
GM Genova said he has defined the goal to outline the specific bullet points listed in
the advance. Director Bagley confirmed the bullet points were generally defined
correctly. Committee Chair Francone asked for GM Genova to explain in the
“exceed expectations” category what he meant by “advance mobility option” and
what that might look like. GM Genova outlined what his idea thought were for the
last mile as in working with Lyft and Uber to offer another service that did not have
a financial impact. He expanded on the fact that it is important that we are
inclusive to everyone in our mobility efforts and the Uber’s and Lyft’s of the world
are not currently accessible.
Director Bagley mentioned that just because a large percent of our constituents did
not have credit cards that we should not pursue all payment options available. GM
Genova said once we start mobile ticketing next year all options for payment will be
available.
Director Bagley asked if in the “exceeds expectation” bullet point 2 under revenue,
he feels that 5% is a large number and is not sure it is a goal can be met. Director
Anderson said if you take out all other defined criteria 5% is not a large number.
GM Genova commented station naming, driving up ridership and third party parking
would all contribute to this goal. Director Bagley asked if there have been
discussions to determine our financial condition. GM Genova said they have had
these conversations and currently in terms of capacity we do not have much to
work with.



Task Goal # 2 – Workforce/Human Capital.
GM Genova said this was a goal he had to start from scratch. He spoke to the
“achieved goal” as outlined and GM Genova explained the different types of the
training offered to employees and a mandatory training path within a particular time
frame for all salaried employees. He went on to outline what is done for employee
recognition and the Employee Recognition Event and defined some of the continuous
improvement model to encourage decision making and ownership for agency
processes. Peak Green Belt pilot is being offered agency wide. GM Genova spoke
to employee recognition and cited a few examples of what they are thinking and the
challenges in planning an agency wide event. The estimated budget could be as
high as $250 thousand dollars.
Director Walker asked about sponsorships. GM Genova said we do utilize our
vendors but was not sure if that would be the best way to move forward. Director
Bagley asked what the Bus and Rail rodeo events cost. GM Genova said he would
get those figures for Director Bagley as he did not have them at his fingertips. GM
Genova said the plan is to recognize the employees in early 2017 for all the work
done for the openings in 2016 and that they do have some small recognitions
planned at all the divisions over the summer such as Ice cream socials and
barbeques which can be executed at a small cost and high impact. GM Genova
spoke to the continuous improvement process working group that he implemented
for the recruitment, hiring and retention process that is currently in motion.
GM Genova said in the “exceeds expectations” he has added “meets bus driver
headcount” and that this would be a stretch target as he does not think we have
ever been at headcount since he has been here. Director Bagley asked if this

6.F

included the outside contractors as well. GM Genova said that vendor staffing is
not within our control therefore not appropriate to include this in our goal.

III.

Task Goal # 3 State of Good Repair – Operations and Maintenance
This was another goal that was completely new. GM Genova reviewed the
elements of the “achieved goals” to be in full compliance to the RTA safety and
asset management rulemakings. Create and measure through reliability reporting
and have a completed State of Good Repair evaluation. GM Genova explained the
“exceeds expectations” and the concept of backlog. Director Anderson asked
where and how can we be sure DTP and DTO are complying with the goal regarding
state of good repair. Dave Genova said we are the owner of the assets for DTP and
they are defined the same way we are and will be tracked and reported on in our
reporting structure.

Review Proposed Meeting Dates

B. Recommended Actions

• 2015 CAFR and Report to Governance
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors accept and enter into the record the District’s audited
financial reports relating to the year ended December 31, 2015 as prepared
by staff and audited by RTD's independent auditor, RubinBrown, LLP.
Motion:

Director Anderson made the motion to
move this item to the full Board at the
May 31, 2016 Board Meeting.
Director Folska seconded the motion.

Discussion: Heather Copp, Chief Financial Officer and Assistant General
Manager of Finance and Administration, and Doug MacLeod,
Controller, introduced Cheryl Wallace from the auditing firm of
RubinBrown, LLP (RubinBrown). Doug MacLeod recognized
staff members Sue Sandoval, Senior Manager of Accounting,
and Tom Barlow, Senior Investment Accountant. He noted
that they and their team have worked diligently since
September to get this audit completed.
Cheryl Wallace clarified the annual audit process with the
Directors. The ViewPoints presentation included in the
Financial Administration and Audit Committee Agenda Packet
for May 24, 2016 contains the communication that every
Packet Pg. 47

Director Lasater and Sisk were absent. Director James arrived late and Director Deadwyler
left early.

6.G

Cheryl Wallace noted that page 6 begins the required Auditor
communication. The left side of the report outlines the
auditing standards and the right side of the report is the
response from RubinBrown. She explained that RubinBrown
issued an unmodified report that was previously called an
unqualified opinion or a clean opinion. On page 7 of the
report, it is notated that RubinBrown planned and scoped the
audit through the engagement process. What is new for this
year was a new governmental accounting standard that was
effective January 1st 2015, which was adopted by RTD.
RubinBrown is also required to inform the Board if there are
any estimates used in the financial statements. There are
estimates because of capital assets and receivables. And
lastly, because of the Government Accounting Standards
Board Statement No. 68 (GASB 68), there is an estimate of
the pension liability. The financial statements are very clear
and concise and there were no difficulties encountered during
the audit. RubinBrown worked with the finance team and
other divisions throughout the District and there were no
difficulties. The only adjustment in the report is an indication
of an accrual which is a client prepared adjustment, not an
audit adjustment. There were no disagreements with
Management, no need for consultation and no other issues
which required attention.
The rest of the document has recommendations for best
practices, observations and suggestions for the District to
consider. One of the audit recommendations from last year
was to review the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and
Innovation Act (TIFIA) loan period of availability and how it is
recognized. Those recommendations were fully put into effect
this year. Additionally, RubinBrown made recommendations
related to how RTD recodes transactions, which have been
partially implemented. RTD staff is in the process of refining
the procedures. The last topic was reviewing the information
technology governance and controls. There is a multi-year
plan that is currently being implemented which is why that
recommendation is partially implemented.

auditor is required to provide to a governing body. She stated
that RTD has retained RubinBrown to perform an independent
audit on the financial statements. Since RTD has received
federal awards over $500,000, RTD has also engaged
RubinBrown to issue an opinion on RTD’s federal awards.

• Resolution No. ___, Series of 2016 related to the issuance of RTD Sales Tax
Revenue Bonds, Series 2016A
It is recommended by the Finance Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the
“Resolution”), authorizing the issuance of Regional Transportation District
Sales Tax Revenue Bonds (FasTracks Projects), Series 2016A.
Motion:

Director Anderson made the motion to
move this item to the full Board at the
May 31, 2016 Board Meeting.
Director Solano seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Heather Copp noted that Dee Wiser of Butler Snow, Chris
Elmore of Goldman Sachs, and Mike Newman of First
Southwest were all present to answer questions if there was
anything staff could not answer.
Brenden Morgan, Senior Manager of Debt and Investments,
explained that the resolution allows for two items. The first is
for new money for new projects, including the Southeast Rail
extension. The second allows for potential refinancing of the
2010A and 2012A FasTracks bonds if market conditions allow
for such refinancing to be economically beneficial to the
District. As of now, refinancing is not an attractive option but
the resolution will allow staff to react should the opportunity
arise. The resolution sets parameters for the sale of these
bonds and limits the principal amount to $200 million dollars.
The maturity is limited to the year 2046, and the maximum

Cheryl Wallace stated as the Board looks forward, there is a
new GASB relating to fair values which will add more
disclosures to financial statements. There is a public private
partnership accounting that will be coming to completion in
2016 and a new standard, GASB 75, will come into play in
2018 related to post employment benefit plans.

6.G

effective interest rate is set at 7%. Drafts of these documents
are in the Board Office for review.

Director Lubow noted that in the Board packet there was
something said about the 2004 vote which authorized a debt
of $3.74 billion and a maximum total repayment cost of $7.1
billion. She wondered if these bonds getting us closer to those
maximums. Heather Copp said yes. Assuming the bonds go
up to the $200 million dollar in principal listed as the not to
exceed number, there will be approximately $100 million
dollars in principal left on those FasTracks bonds. However,
with interest rates it could be a little more or a little less.
Director Lubow expressed concern as an unfunded corridor is
in her District. She stated if RTD issues these bonds it leaves
nothing left for the unfunded corridors.
Director Lubow asked for further information about refinancing
if it is economically feasible. She said it was her understanding
if we refinance the repayment of debt will be extended 10
years past the original date. Heather Copp indicated that at
this point in time staff would not know, but the statute
indicates that any refunding cannot exceed 15 years past the
original due date. Brenden Morgan added that historically
when there have been refinancings the debt will be structured
with similar, if not identical, maturity payments. Heather
Copp reiterated staff does not know if the bonds will be
refinanced but this allows staff the flexibility if it does make
financial sense at a later date.
Director Lubow stated she would be voting in favor for this
but has reservations about leaving so little in the FasTracks
pot.
Director Francone asked for confirmation that the resolution
would allow for the potential refinancing of certain bonds but
that staff did not plan to refinance at this time. Brenden
Morgan indicated that the two main items authorized under
the resolution are: raising new capital for projects, up to $200
million dollars, and refinancing of the 2010A and 2012A
FasTracks bonds. This action item is allowing staff flexibility
to capture a potential opportunity if it becomes available.

Heather Copp clarified that in addition to funding for the
Southeast Corridor, this will also complete financing for the
rest of Eagle, North Metro and I-225 projects. Although those
projects are underway, they have not been fully funded.

6.G

Committee Chair Menten stated that she would be voting no
for this item. She said while it is great that the community has
contributed so much for the Southeast Rail extension, she is
concerned with our debt load and current projections that this
will risk operations. She stated we might be able to build it,
but if we cannot sustain it, that creates a concern.

• Resolution No. ___, Resolution expressing the intent of the Board to be
reimbursed for certain expenses relating to the financing of buses
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the
“Resolution”), expressing the intent of the Board to be reimbursed from a
future financing for certain expenses relating to the acquisition of buses.
Motion:

Chair Tobiassen made the motion to
move this item to the full Board at the
May 31, 2016 Board Meeting.
Director Anderson seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Brenden Morgan indicated that this resolution is a
reimbursement resolution very similar to one that was done for
the FasTracks bonds two months ago. The resolution
expresses the intent of the Board to be reimbursed from future
financing related to the acquisition of buses. The Strategic
Budget Plan (SBP), as approved by the Board in 2015,
anticipates that the financing of buses. He indicated the fleet
is constantly being refreshed as buses age. Some of the
vehicles identified in the SBP will begin to arrive this month.
The financing for these vehicles will be done in the future, but
Packet Pg. 51

Heather Copp added that the reason that these two bonds
were combined under one action is because the market is
moving quickly. If staff had to bring this back to another
meeting the opportunity could be missed because the market
is constantly changing.

• Salaried Employee Trustee Replacement
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors approve the attached Resolution No. ______ amending
the Salaried Employee Defined Benefit (i.e., Pension) Plan and Salaried
Employee Defined Contribution Plan to provide for appointment of the same
four employee trustees for each of the plans, with two trustees being
employee participants in the Pension Plan, and two being employee
participants in the Defined Contribution Plan. The resolution further provides
that the three existing employee trustees serving both plans remain as
trustees with revised termination dates to assure continued staggered terms,
and that a fourth employee be appointed to replace retired trustee Marla
Lien.
Motion:

Chair Tobiassen made the motion to
move this item to the full Board at the
May 31, 2016 Board Meeting.
Director Lubow seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Heather Copp reminded the Board that there are two salaried
plans. One is the Employee Defined Benefit Plan, known as
the Pension Plan, which was closed in January 2008 to new
salaried employees. The new plan is the Salaried Employees
Defined Contribution Plan. There are seven trusties for each
plan, and they are the same trusties. Previously, the trustee
compilation has been two Board Members, the CFO, and four
other trusties. Up until this time it has been two senior
AGM’s, and two middle managers. The trustees decided there

Director Hoy asked if we are paying for the buses out of our
normal operating cash which would then be reimbursed by
future loans for that equipment. Brenden Morgan stated that
was correct.

6.G

Director Francone asked when the appointment for the
vacancy will be filled. Heather Copp indicated that as soon as
the Board approves the resolution, an announcement will be
made to employees to ask for applications. Director Francone
inquired if the committee makes the final decision on the
replacement, or will Chair Tobiassen. Heather Copp noted
that the Chair of the Board, the Chair of the Trust and the
Chair of the Financial Administration and Audit Committee
make the decision.
Committee Chair Menten noted that this update makes the
trusteeship much more inclusive. She thanked staff for
bringing this forward.

C. Updates

• General Manager Contract Review
Cheryl Wallace of RubinBrown, LLP (RubinBrown), reported to the Board that
RubinBrown was engaged to review the terms of the GM contract that was
just signed. RubinBrown reviewed the terms to look at the annual cost of
the contract and verified that those amounts were in accordance with the
contract terms. RubinBrown will come back annually to report to the Board
what the actual incurred costs were for the District and we will compare
that to the projected costs of the GM contract. One item to point out to the
Board that is different from the previous GM contract is that in prior years,
the GM participated in the Defined Contribution Plan. In this contract the
GM is only participating in the Defined Benefit Plan.

should be a different representation to include two members
from the Pension Plan and two members from the Defined
Contribution Plan. The current trusties are: Director Lubow,
Chair Tobiassen, Scott Reed, Lou Ha, Sylvia Francis and
Heather Copp. She said the trustees have been working with
Steve Weinstein, the attorney for both plans. Mr. Weinstein
agrees with the changes as presented as do the current
trustees.

Doug MacLeod reiterated that these are the March results, so the first quarter
of the fiscal year. All of the indicators are red when compared to the budget.
For the first quarter, sales and use tax is under budget by 5.6%, ridership is
under budget 3.7%, and fare revenue is under budget 11.6%. Ridership
continues to not only be under budget but under where we were last year by
4.4%. For fare revenue, year-to-date we are $3.9 million under budget.
Staff has been watching fare revenue and sales and use taxes closely
because those figures are used in the SBP and the amended budget. Staff
will be keeping close tabs on the new fare structure to see how that
progresses throughout the year. To date, the $11.3 million shortfall was
caused by lower ridership, lower fare revenue and lower sales and use taxes.
Staff anticipates that we will be at a $32-43 million shortfall by the end of
the year.
Director Bagley indicated that given the unpleasant situation with lower fare
and sales and use tax revenues, staff ought to be looking at where we are
going to adjust and make potential cuts in our budget for this year. Director
Bagley asked if staff had looked into initiating a thoughtful review of how we
are going to adjust that moving forward. General Manager Genova noted
that staff started that process in January. He said there is a plan going
forward with the amended budget to include some significant adjustments.
Director Lubow asked if staff knew why the projected sales and use tax and
fare revenue were so different from reality. Heather Copp reminded the Board
that the recent Colorado School of Leeds presentation included some of their
reasoning for it. She stated their below trend forecast is what we are
actually seeing. She believes some of the factors are the softening economy,
the GDP not growing as expected, uncertainty with the current political
environment, and the daily Federal interest rate discussions. There is a lot of
uncertainty and in just the last few months, consumer spending dropped
dramatically, especially in the area of new and used vehicles.
Director Hoy said he has heard mixed comments regarding internet sales and
if RTD will receive sales tax from them. Heather Copp noted that in March
we did receive sales tax from Amazon. She said staff was not expecting it
and neither was the Department of Revenue (DOR); however, even with that,
the sales and use tax revenue is still down. Director Hoy noted since
Amazon is self-reporting that works but if an internet company is not selfreporting RTD will not receive any sales tax. Heather Copp stated that was
cored and explained that the DOR cannot give us the information at a
granular level.
Packet Pg. 54

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 24, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Heather Copp stated that sales and use tax was down again. She noted that
staff will be coming to the Board next month with the Amended Budget
where there will be adjustments made to the sales and use tax estimates as
well as Fare Box revenues to account for the changes seen during the first
quarter.

6.G

Committee Chair Menten noted that in prior years RTD did have to make
some dramatic service cuts. She asked from a historical perspective what
the shortfall was in those years. Heather Copp noted that we cut 7-8% of
service and which equated to $20-$30 million dollars when combined with
other changes including cancelling projects, salary freezes, etc. Heather
Copp stated she does not expect service cuts to be needed as there are
enough projects to defer.
Brenden Morgan noted that this report has been updated to make it easier to
read. The yield for the District’s unrestricted portfolio for the first quarter
was 0.6%, which would produce annual earnings of $1.8 million dollars. He
explained that the graphs included in the report show the investment
performance over time as compared to the benchmark that is set in the
policy. Historically performance has been just above, but in-line with the
benchmark. That trend continues today.

• SBP First Draft
Jannette Scarpino, Senior Manager of Budget and Financial Analysis, noted
that there is a first draft cash flow included in the updated Strategic Budget
Plan (SBP). She reminded the Board that a high level overview of the SBP
was presented in April and tonight staff will discuss the first draft cash flow.
The SBP only includes the base system plan and FasTracks operations
activity. The FasTracks expense and projects are shown separately and
brought to the Board in the Annual Program Evaluation (APE). The SBP
parameters include fiscal management, including requirements to operate per
specified performance measures, and strategic and tactical goals for the GM
while maintaining a balanced budget over a six year period. The SBP also
incorporates building our reserves in both the Board Appropriated Fund and
the Capital Replacement Fund and maintaining our current service levels.
The baseline for the SBP is the 2016 Amended Budget with a fuel lock price
of $2.23/gallon escalated by the national Consumer Price Index. She
indicated capital and expense projects would need to be prioritized as
currently there is a $220 million shortfall
Jannette Scarpino reminded the Board that there are many factors that make
up the SBP, some of which are in staff’s control and some that are not. The
factors include:
Uncontrollable SBP factors –
 Sales/use tax revenue
 Fuel price volatility
 Inflation rate
 Continued nature of economic growth
 Interest rates on debt
 Ridership

The target for the fund balances is $100 million which represents three
months of operating expenses. For the 2017-2022 SBP Revenue
Assumptions, the next fare increases should occur in 2019 and 2022. The
March 2016 forecast from CU Leeds will be used for sales and use tax
assumptions. Federal Grants are assumed to increase at the rate of inflation
or as identified in the grant parameters. For expenditures, operating and
maintenance costs are inflated based on the CPI, fuel cost is budget at the
2016 lock and escalated at the CPI and capital expenses are prioritized based
on a scoring methodology.
Jannette Scarpino outlined the next steps as follows:
 June 14 – Board adoption of the 2016 Amended Budget and
2017-2022 SBP Update
 July 12 – 2017-2022 SBP Update
 August 9 – Presentation of final 2017-2022 SBP to the
Financial Administration and Audit Committee
 August 16 – Board adoption of 2017-2022 SBP
 August 23 – 2017 Budget Study Session
Heather Copp explained that staff was delaying approval of the SBP so the
Board could see it together with the FasTracks APE. She noted in the current
SBP the fund balances do not reach $100 million until 2022, which had been
something discussed during the Board/Senior Leadership advance as a priority
to reach sooner.
Director Lubow asked how staff would characterize in the current financial
situation. She pointed out that RTD is seeing revenues below projections but
her impression is the economy is okay. Heather Copp indicated Director
Lubow summarized the situation very well. The economy is doing fine and
there is stable growth rate but not as exponentially as was seen after the
recent recession. She stated that RTD is not near a crisis situation, we just
need to be reasonable about spending and prioritize the most important
expenses. There was a long period of time when projects were deferred so
there are a lot of areas that need to be addressed. She emphasized that
revenues are still growing at very good rates of 4-5%, but not the rates of 79% that was happening after the recession. Director Lubow asked if this
was a situation where we should be spending down some of our reserves.

The areas that we can control are –
 Fare rate increases/decreases
 Service levels
 Operating costs/expense projects
 Capital investment in projects
 Fund balance development

Heather Copp stated no; staff just needs to be conservative and cut down on
expenditures and operating costs. General Manager Genova added that he
cannot remember a year since he has been here there were no deferred
projects.

General Manager Genova added that as staff looks at that prioritization,
information from asset management will be used to help focus on maintaining
our State of Good Repair.

• Smart Media Technology (SMT)
Heather Copp introduced Tonya Anderson as the new Manager of Electronic
Fare Operations and asked her to provide the Board with her background.
Tonya Anderson noted that she has worked on the Smart Card project for 4
years. She brings a lot of insight and history on the program. She was
previously an Officer in the United States the Air Force as an IT project
manager.
Tonya Anderson pointed out that may of the status indicators continue to be
yellow due to an accelerated timeline for the project elements; however, the
project is benefitting from an improved relationship with our vendor, Xerox.
They are stepping up and helping the team meet the project deadlines. There
are no roadblocks preventing the team from meeting the goal to launch the
MyRide web portal on June 30th.
Tonya Anderson noted that for the merchant retail point of sales program,
staff has been in active discussions with King Soopers and very recently
began discussions with Albertson’s. Both are very excited to participate and
key stores have been selected at Denver Metro King Soopers for testing. She
said it was very encouraging progress.
Tonya Anderson pointed out that the handheld readers have changed from
green to yellow since the last update. There have been challenges with the
implementation of the software, but that was resolved within the last week so
the team is proceeding forward. The devices should be distributed for testing
and field training soon.
Director Folska asked when is the anticipated date for going live with the
entire Smart Media program. Tonya Anderson indicated that the web portal
element will be live on June 30th. Staff is working diligently to complete the
rest of the project by the end of the year.

Director Hoy noted that some people may recall that when Don Hunt took
over CDOT he had money set aside for bridge repair, a highway
improvement, etc., but not enough to complete any one project. He
wondered if it was correct to say that RTD is in a similar situation. Heather
Copp explained that staff is looking at projects to prioritize what gets done.

6.G

Chair Tobiassen noted that 1500 cards over 17 weeks seems like a very small
number. He asked if we were no longer promoting the pilot. Heather Copp
indicated that there are another 219 vouchers that will be mailed this week
but will be slowing down the launch of the web portal approaches on June
30th. She said there was not as much interest as staff was originally hoping.

• Real Time Passenger Information Demo
Rahul Sood, Manager of Software Architecture and Development, reviewed a
Power Point Presentation with the Board that is included in the May 24,
2016 Financial Administration and Audit Committee Agenda Packet. He
explained that the project was started about a year and a half ago and realtime information for bus service is now available to the public through
Google, Transit App and ezRide. The goal of real-time information is to
reduce frustration and increase customer satisfaction. Eventually, the
information will be available on the RTD website as well as the information
display signs at the stations. Staff hopes to have information for Light and
Commuter rail available by the end of the year.
Director Folska asked if the disabled communities were engaged during
testing. She suggested reaching out to the National Federation for the Blind,
CCDC and so forth. Rahul Sood said that right now the real-time information
was only published by third parties. He added that for the work we are doing
for our Next Ride application, Communications is working with that
community
Director Folska noted that instead of tools for playing games while people
wait for their bus or train the apps should send people to Amazon. Rahul
Sood explained that the trend is going that way. There are options based on
location for dining or shopping.
Director Anderson questioned if the app provided options when a service is
unavailable, such as the recent University of Colorado A-Line shutdown.
Rahul Sood explained that the University of Colorado A-Line does not have
real time data yet; however, the apps will offer different route options and
indicate if a service is delayed.

Committee Chair Menten noted that the officers had a lot of complaints about
the handheld readers and this needs a lot of testing. She wondered how long
there was technical support from the vendor. Eric Farrington, IT Program
Manager, indicated that we have one year software support from Xerox from
the date of acceptance, which has not yet been done. The iPhones were
purchased from a different vendor and we have one year of support for those
as well. Committee Chair Menten asked if the equipment would only be the
iPhones or if there was another component. Eric Farrington said there are two
pieces of equipment: the iPhone and the scanner.

6.G

General Manager Genova added that staff wanted to give the Board a
snapshot on the different transit apps available to the public. He said every
week our data seems to be picked up by a new 3rd party.
Committee Chair Menten asked if the MyStop numbers can be added to
Google Maps. Rahul Sood explained that Google already has that
information.

D. Other Matters
There were no other matters.

Director Hoy shared that he was sitting on Colfax one day for lunch and
opened Transit App. He did not see the buses show up on the app that he
saw driving by. He wondered what might be the cause. Rahul Sood
explained that at that time, the information was published every 20 seconds
so there might have been a delay in receiving accurate information. Since
that time the information is now updated every 5 seconds.

B. Recommended Actions

• Authorization to Enter into a Contract with Motorola Solutions for Purchase
of Radios (56DH012)
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that
the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to
enter into a $940,000 sole source contract with Motorola
Solutions(Motorola) for purchase of mobile, portable and tower radios and
associated equipment (Contract Number 56DH012). This contract will
include an option for a 3-year extended warranty.
Motion:

Director Bagley made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the May 31, 2016
Board Meeting.
Director Folska seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Terry Emmons, Assistant General Manager of Rail Operations,
indicated this request is for additional radios for security
personnel and operators on light rail vehicles and associated
equipment.
Chair Tobiassen inquired as to the life expectancy of the
radios. He wondered if these were to replace some of the
radios originally purchased or if these were to supplement
those radios. Eric Farrington, IT Program Manager, indicated
these were in addition to the originally purchased radios.
These radios have a life expectancy of 15 years and many are

• Parking Management Extended to New Facilities
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that
the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to include new parking
facilities in the Parking Management Program.
Motion:

Chair Tobiassen made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the May 31, 2016
Board Meeting.
Director Bagley seconded the motion.

Motion to
Postpone to
a Time
Certain:
Chair Tobiassen made the motion to postpone
this item until the August 9, 2016 Operations
and Customer Service Committee Meeting.
Director Walker seconded the motion. Director
Walker later withdrew his second and Director
Folska seconded the motion.
Discussion:

Chair Tobiassen explained that the Parking Management
Program (Program) was adopted by the Board in 2008, which
was quite some time ago. There has been a great deal of
progress since then on the FasTracks program. He stated this
is a new world with new parking opportunities. Additionally,
the State Legislature has also changed RTD’s ability to partner
as it relates to parking. Chair Tobiassen thinks this is the time
to evaluate the Program and make it more inclusive in terms of
how RTD works with other jurisdictions as it relates to
parking.

Packet Pg. 62

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 24, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Committee Chair Anderson declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

6.H

Director Folska thanked Chair Tobiassen for taking the
initiative to postpone this recommendation until August. She
does not think it is at all ready for primetime so she will be
supporting the motion.
Director Hoy noted the irony in this item being on the agenda
tonight as he was still wearing his steel toed boots from an
earlier tour at the Westminster Station, including the new
parking structure. He does not know if anyone has talked to
Westminster or if Westminster has any plans but he thinks it
would be a good idea to at least have a discussion with them.
Chair Tobiassen commented that there is a similar situation in
Aurora where RTD and Aurora partnered to build the parking
garage at Iliff Station. He stated the negotiations related to
managing that structure and parking around the station were
still ongoing. He reiterated that postponing this item gives
RTD a chance to step back and make sure input from other
jurisdictions is included in the Program. He pointed out that
there is also a parking study in-progress that the Board should
be seeing soon and believes it is important to have this
information before moving forward.
General Manager Genova indicated staff would be bringing the
initial report from the parking study analysis to the Board in
July. He said staff would not be asking the Board to take any
action but would be reviewing the findings and information to
consider as the parking dialog continues.
General Manager Genova stated that with regards to the Olde
Town Arvada, Westminster, Iliff and Boulder Junction at
Depot Square stations, staff has had very specific
conversations with those parties. He clarified that this action
would have no impact on parking facilities where RTD has an
Packet Pg. 63

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 24, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Menten recognized that Chair Tobiassen gave a high
level explanation for his reasons for wanting to postpone this
item but asked for specifics. Committee Chair Anderson
reminded the Board that the City of Arvada has invested $30
million into the parking structure at the Olde Town station.
She would like to see RTD work with our partners that are
making these huge investments in our parking structures to
come up with a more up-to-date Parking Management Program
rather than use something from 2008 that did not anticipate
these scenarios. She hopes there can be a more inclusive
process.

6.H

Chair Tobiassen reiterated that there is an opportunity to look
at the parking study in conjunction with the Parking
Management Program to evaluate what really make sense and
ensure our jurisdictions understand how RTD does business
from a parking perspective.
Director Menten expressed concern that RTD would be giving
up revenue by holding off on this action as the garages
mentioned by other Directors would not be affected. General
Manager Genova explained that RTD currently charges for
parking at the Central Park and 40th and Pena stations along
the University of Colorado A-Line and stated that Director
Menten was correct that we would be giving up revenue at
the other stations along that line. The recommendation to
include the new parking facilities in the Parking Management
Program would not include facilities for which there was
already an IGA in place such as the Iliff and Westminster
stations. He indicated that staff is currently having ongoing
conversations/negotiations with the respective municipalities
about how those facilities would be managed.
Errol Stevens, Parking Management Administrator, pointed out
that a 90 day notice must be posted prior to charging for
parking, which has been done along the University of Colorado
A-Line facilities. He said this means RTD could begin charging
for parking at the remaining University of Colorado A-Line
Park-n-Rides beginning July 25, 2016. He believes RTD would
capture more revenue as staff is seeing more travelers on that
line. Director Menten stated she would prefer to get the
additional revenue and people into the groove if it will not
affect the stations other Directors were concerned about.
Robin McIntosh, Senior Manager of Facilities, apologized for
not providing the Board with the option to just approve adding
Packet Pg. 64

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 24, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

agreement or Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with a
municipality. He explained this action would allow RTD to
move forward with the current Parking Management Program
on the new corridors, particularly the University of Colorado ALine. He thinks there is a great opportunity for increased
revenue as staff anticipates parking along that line to increase.
He stated delaying approval until August would delay
implementation as he cannot authorize the vendor to undergo
installation of necessary equipment without Board approval.
He believes it will take approximately 30 to 60 days to
implement after approval.

6.H

Rolf Asphaug, Acting General Council, suggested that the
Board could defeat the motion to postpone and then move to
amend the pending motion to narrow it down or change the
wording to allow certain stations to be excluded. Committee
Chair Anderson agreed that sounded like a fairly good plan and
asked Chair Tobiassen and Director Walker how they wanted
to proceed.
Chair Tobiassen stated he preferred to move forward with
postponing the item. He understands the negotiations with
Aurora are not going well and the IGA is up in the air, to put it
mildly, which he finds disturbing. He explained that is his
reason behind wanting to ensure the Parking Management
Program is really evaluated. He stated with the situation on
the University of Colorado A-Line over the past few days it
might not be bad to delay charging until things are stabilized
and operating consistently.
Director Hoy asked if his understanding was correct that
regardless of tonight’s decision, the Westminster station
would be independent of the Parking Management Program
and thus not be affected either positively or negatively. Robin
McIntosh stated that was correct.
Director Bagley pointed out that parking is the elephant in the
room, for the entire District. He stated parking is a very
critical issue. He believes RTD needs to start setting
parameters about how we deal with parking management so it
is not one-off situations all the time.
Director Walker wondered if there would be anything
precluding another jurisdiction from approaching RTD about
entering into an IGA if the staff recommendation was passed
this evening. General Manager Genova indicated an
agreement could be entered into with a municipality,
jurisdiction, etc. should we want to do something differently.
Committee Chair Anderson stated her objection is that this is a
policy from 2008. She said she has been hearing from cities
that say the program is not working and there is no
negotiating. She believes with more time it would be possible

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 24, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

the Park-n-Rides along the University of Colorado A-Line. He
explained staff’s intent had been to approve adding all the
facilities so they did not have to bother the Board on a
continuing basis as new lines opened.

6.H

to come up with a good plan. She agrees with Director
Menten’s concern about losing revenue but it is only a period
of a few months.

Henry Stopplecamp noted that there were really two issues on
the table: locations where RTD owns the property completely
and sites where we have teamed up with other local
municipalities and have an IGA. He stated locations where
there is an IGA are really different than RTD surface Park-nRides. He explained the intent of staff’s recommendation was
to cover anything not already covered through an IGA. He
said staff is more than happy to work with the various
municipalities going forward.
Errol Stevens said his sense is if the four facilities of concern
could be disconnected from the other new parking facilities
staff’s recommendation could advance; however, a
postponement would tie up both items as it stands now. He
questioned if the Board could find a way to separate the two
issues to approve the Parking Management Program for those
facilities that are solely owned and operated by RTD.
Director James thinks the idea of segmenting the two issues is
interesting. He wondered if passing staff’s recommendation
this evening would preclude the Board from making future
changes based on the results of the parking study. Errol
Stevens explained this action just established what facilities
were including the Parking Management Program; if the Board
voted to approve a new program these facilities would then be
covered by that program.
General Manager Genova reminded the Board that staff moved
forward with a parking study due to an unsolicited proposal
that was received related to monetizing parking District-wide.
It was determined the proposal had merit but there were many
questions surrounding the concept. He explained that even if
the Board wanted to move forward with a different program
down the road the facilities covered by IGAs would still have
Packet Pg. 66

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 24, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Lubow wondered if it would be possible to just deal
with the University of Colorado A-Line and allow for a more
thorough discussion on the other lines to continue. She thinks
it would be good to do something that will generate revenue
while still allowing the Board to look at the broader issues.
Henry Stopplecamp stated it would be possible to make an
amendment to the original motion.

6.H

Director James asked if staff had an estimate as to how much
revenue would be generated from the additional University of
Colorado A-Line facilities. Errol Stevens stated it would be
difficult to provide a figure with all the changes in travel
patterns with the opening of the line. He said overall the
program produces $1.3 million in gross revenue per year so he
does not anticipate it will be a large figure.
Director James indicated he would vote against the motion to
postpone.
Director Walker commented that the reason several Directors
want to postpone the recommendation is to give our partners
more time to evaluate the program. He indicated after hearing
more from staff and the fact that the facilities of concern will
not be included, he is going to withdraw his second. He
believes there is the opportunity for discussion but will provide
some revenue and stability for the University of Colorado ALine.
Director Folska stated she would second the motion to
postpone this recommendation to a date certain.
Director Folska said she had similar concerns to those
expressed by other Directors. She feels that the current
Program is just patchwork. There is not a program that is
clear and ubiquitous for the entire District. She believes effort
should be put into doing something thoughtful and consistent.
Director Folska also thinks there are bigger fish to fry like why
the University of Colorado A-Line is not working like it should.
Director Lubow noted that whether the Board approved the
recommendation this evening or not, staff understands that
they need to go forward and do a thorough review of the
current Program. She does not want RTD to lose revenue
which is why she will vote against postponing; however, she
reiterated that it is important to continue to have discussions
about where parking is going.
Packet Pg. 67

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 24, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

to be bifurcated out of the new program. He said another item
to consider is how to deal with the contract currently in place
with our Parking Management provider that is good through
2018. If the Board were to fundamentally change how the
program is managed we would have to negotiate closing out
our contract with the provider.

6.H

Committee Chair Anderson expressed that in reading the
recommendation she did not feel it exempted anything. She
does not think staff has listened to our partners so she will be
voting in favor of postponing.

• 2016 Title VI Program Update
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that
the Board of Directors adopt the 2016 Title VI Program Update to comply
with federal laws, regulations and guidelines related to Title VI of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964.
Motion:

Director Solano made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the May 31, 2016
Board Meeting.
Director Walker seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager of Planning,
introduced Michael Washington, Title VI Manager, and Shontel
Lewis, Title VI Specialist, who reviewed a Power Point
presentation that is included in the May 24, 2016 Operations
and Customer Service Committee Agenda Packet.
Michael Washington reminded the Board that a Title VI
Program Update must be submitted to the Federal Transit
Administration every three years as a condition of federal
financial assistance. He said that as the Board was probably
aware, Title VI prohibits discrimination on the basis of race,
color and national origin. The FTA prescribes the following
measures to guide recipients of federal funds in the promotion
of socially equitable transit:
 Equity Analyses
 System-Wide Service Standards and Policies
 Service Monitoring
Packet Pg. 68

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 24, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Rolf Asphaug pointed out that since there were 12 Directors
at the meeting the motion to postpone to a time certain would
require 7 in favor to pass.

6.H

 Public Engagement

Shontel Lewis outlined the philosophy related to public
engagement as follows:
 Meet the Community Where They Are
 Identify Generalizable Concerns
 Build Rapport with the Community
 Partner with the Community
She explained as part of the process the environmental justice
communities first had to be identified. These are communities
within the affected area that have an above average
proportion of minority and low-income households.
Shontel Lewis noted there were many challenges during the
public engagement process such as circulation of
misinformation, trust and transparency. Staff’s goals were to
illustrate the benefits of the service changes, remediate
misunderstandings and listen to community concerns. She
said there were four strategies used during the public
engagement process which included having volunteers ride
routes within the effected communities, having tables and
volunteers at Park-n-Rides and bus stops, driver outreach, and
public meetings called “Know Your Routes”.
Shontel Lewis stated this was really a great opportunity to
engage with the community. The team made contact with
over 1,000 riders who really appreciated the efforts made by
RTD.
Michael Washington highlighted the importance of
understanding the level of effort that went into making sure
our riders would not be negatively impacted by the large
amount of changes that were happening with the University of
Colorado A-Line opening. It was incredibly important to make
sure everyone was aware of the changes and how to take
advantage of them.

Packet Pg. 69

Michael Washington explained that an equity analyses must
take place for any fare changes as well as any major service
changes and all new openings. He noted that public
engagement was a very important part of the process. He
asked Shontel Lewis to review the recent public engagement
process during the equity analyses for the University of
Colorado A-Line Service Changes.

• August 2016 Service Change Final
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that
the Board of Directors approve the August 2016 Service Change package as
revised and summarized in Attachment A resulting in an annualized cost of
approximately $1,085,400 and, further, to authorize the General Manager or
his designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private
operators whose service is impacted by these changes.
Motion:

Director Bagley made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the May 31, 2016
Board Meeting.
Director Folska seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations,
shared with the Board that staff received a letter from
Commerce City requesting that Route 62 be removed from the
August Service Changes. He explained that originally this
route was to be funded through a grant received by Commerce
City; however, there was supposed to be a new roadway
constructed for the route that is not yet complete. Bruce Abel
said per Commerce City’s request staff was asking for an
amendment to remove Route 62 from the August Service
Changes.

Route 62 from the August Service Changes.

Director Francone thanked the team for doing such a good job.
She requested an electronic copy of the full update that would

make it available.

6.H

Discussion:

Jessie Carter, Manager of Service Planning and Scheduling,
reminded the Board that in August there is the
reimplementation of school service, which accounts for a
majority of the changes. He noted the increase in service of
the Free Metro Ride but pointed out this was entirely funded
through a Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement
Grant. He explained that August Service Changes will now
have an annualized cost of approximately $549,600 versus
$1,085,400 when Route 62 was included.
Chair Tobiassen stated there were several minor service
changes along Route 43 that were needed in his District
related to bus stop placement. Jessie Carter explained this is
something that staff is working on but per new Federal Transit
Administration Guidelines all new bus stops must be 100%
ADA compliant. Bruce Abel shared that staff would be
briefing the Board on these changes next month with more
detail as staff is evaluating how they impact our operations.
Director Francone asked staff to speak to the proposed Route
CV/CS/CX. She wondered if it negatively affected any riders.
Jessie Carter explained that the proposal is to convert the last
Route CV trip to a Route CS trip so it also served the Federal
Center Station. He said there were four people that provided
comments and believe it would be better to add a trip than
convert the last trip. He noted adding a trip would cost money
so at this time staff is standing with the current proposal. He
stated the four people that provided comments believe this
negatively impacts them.
Director Francone wondered if the Lockheed Martin Call-n-Ride
was still operating or if it has been folded into the South
Jeffco Call-n-Ride service. Bruce Abel stated there were no
recommendations at this time to eliminate the Lockheed
Martin service. Director Francone said it would be interesting
to see if ridership has been improving. Bruce Abel commented
that ridership has not improved and the service is currently
under review.
Director Hoy asked for clarification about the differences
between Route 72 and 72W. Jessie Carter explained that

C. Updates

 University of Colorado A Line Update (no back-up)
Bruce Abel explained that staff wanted to provide a brief update on ridership
numbers after the first four weeks of operations on the University of
Colorado A-Line. He said ridership averages were 15,860 for the first week,
16,900 for the second week, 17,640 for the third week and 16,700 for the
fourth week. He shared that ridership data has been gathered from the
automatic passenger counters that were installed on all commuter rail
vehicles.

• RTD Commuter Rail Oversight
Terry Emmons, Assistant General Manager of Rail Operations, introduced
Walt Stringer, Senior Manager of Commuter Rail, Henry Stopplecamp,
Acting Assistant General Manager of Capital Programs, and Greg Straight,
Engineering Project Manager. He asked Walt Stringer to review the Power
Point presentation that was included in the May 24, 2016 Operations and
Customer Service Committee Agenda Packet.
Walt Stringer explained that since service began on the University of
Colorado A-Line, staff wanted to ensure the Board understood how RTD
oversees Denver Transit Partners (DTP) and the commuter rail performance,
the metrics that must be met, and the invoice process. He said RTD staff
utilizes a comprehensive Oversight Plan with Concession Agreement (CA)
specific forms to record observations. He stated that Availability Payments
are pre-set payments outlined by the Concession Agreement that may
include a performance adjustment if certain metrics are not met. Invoices
are submitted by DTP that capture all required performance elements. These

Packet Pg. 72

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 24, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Hoy also asked for further information about Route 31
as he found the explanation confusing. Jessie Carter
explained that staff would be using an interline change to
provide a trip further north at no cost.

6.H

invoices are then reviewed by RTD staff to confirm accuracy of the
information submitted by DTP versus the observations made by RTD staff.

Chair Tobiassen asked staff for an update on current operations of the
University of Colorado A-Line and the recent issues. General Manager
Genova stated during the first few weeks of operations on-time performance
was very good averaging above 95%. He said the first major problem
occurred last Monday when power was lost to a train resulting in passengers
being stuck on the train for a very long time. Subsequently the University of
Colorado A-Line has been experiencing a number of power outages that
have been traumatic for our passengers, especially if they are stuck on a
train. General Manager Genova indicated the most recent issue happened
this afternoon with a train getting stuck on the bridge over Peña Boulevard
resulting in the ultimate evacuation of the train.
General Manager Genova explained that while the team was able to
determine the cause of most of the power outages, there are still some that
the reason has not been determined which is concerning. He recognized
Aaron Epstein and John Thompson from DTP who were here this evening to
answer any questions. He shared that RTD and DTP staff have regular
meetings regarding operations. He also has a monthly call with the DTP
Board of Directors, which he just had this morning. He indicated he was
able to have a very frank conversation with the Board discussing the
incidents of the past week. He said he made it very clear that this is not
satisfactory to RTD but recognized it is not satisfactory for DTP either.
General Manager Genova shared he asked the DTP Board what they planned
to do for the patrons that missed flights. They are working diligently to
provide safe, reliable service. He stated no one was taking these issues
lightly and everyone was concerned.
Director Folska feels bewildered that there are these types of problems after
the extensive testing that was done. She wonders what has changed from
when testing was occurring to cause the current events to happen. General
Manager Genova stated that to his knowledge there were no power issues
during testing and training so everyone was very surprised when this
became an issue last week. He explained whenever there was an issue the
team looked at everting to drill down to the root cause. He shared that the
cause of each power outage has been different so there was not a specific
issue that could be identified as the problem. Today a messenger wire
broke, impacting power along the entire line until the issue was isolated.

Packet Pg. 73

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 24, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Lubow inquired if RTD or DTP was responsible for collection of
fares. Walt Stringer stated RTD provides the Ticket Vending Machines and
fare collection is RTD’s responsibility.

6.H

Terry Emmons noted that just because this is a new line it does not mean it
is perfect. He has dealt with several openings and there are always nuances
and issues that must be addressed.

Henry Stopplecamp commented this was not an issue of a “black swan” but
the process that happens when new service begins. The service starts small
and gets expanded as there are lessons learned. He said there had been
issues over the 22 years light rail had been in operations but staff dealt with
them. He shared that last Monday the power outage was due to a phase
break issue that has already been resolved in a way so that it physically
cannot happen again at that section. He stated unfortunately things happen
but the question is how quickly staff can respond to an issue.
Director Lubow said it seems like issues are happening in an order of
magnitude more than we should be experiencing. Henry Stopplecamp
pointed out that the trains had been running since November and last week
is the first time there was a loss of power.
Greg Straight emphasized that the project team is not making excuses. No
one involved finds recent performance acceptable. The entire team is doing
everything to get service to the level expected based on existing light rail.
He said generally the issues have been one-off type issues that are quickly
identified, fixed, tested and then perform stably. He stated that it is not a
scenario where the same issue is happening repeatedly.
Director Menten asked staff to compile information on how many times the
University of Colorado A-Line has broken down, how long those instances
were in duration and if it required an evacuation. She stated she needs to
be prepared with this information when she is asked questions from the
public. General Manager Genova said he would send a write-up to the entire
Board.
Director Menten noted General Manager Genova mentioned asking DTP what
they planned to do for people that missed flights but did not recall hearing
their response. She said it is one thing to give someone $9 back but what
about their flight costs. General Manager Genova stated for those patrons
contacting RTD we are giving them a free ride coupon or refund of their fare;
however, it has not been RTD’s policy to make larger reimbursements and
Packet Pg. 74

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 24, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Lubow stated this seems to be an anomaly or “black swan” that
engineers did not predict being an issue. She wonders what we do in this
situation. She asked if buses are standing by to pick people up if there are
problems. General Manager Genova stated that just like on light rail, if there
is a service interruption that staff expects to be for a significant period of
time a bus bridge is put in place.

6.H

Director Bagley reiterated that while we have had light rail for 22 years it
was done very incrementally. There has never been commuter rail in Denver
and commuter rail has not yet been operated during the spring. He
suggested that perhaps the spring thunder storms over the last week could
be the issue. He stated that stuff happens and we address it. If a burned
out wire caused an issue this week then we need to figure out what to do
so it does not happen again. He said he is very satisfied with where RTD
and DTP are going. He commented that when something is developed that
is so technologically complex you cannot expect that nothing will ever
happen. He thanked everyone for all their efforts.
Chair Tobiassen concurred with Director Bagley. He thinks it is important for
the Board to keep an eye on recurring events and have good answers for
constituents. He appreciates everyone’s hard work. He asked for daily
updates that included details so the Board could stay informed. Chair
Tobiassen also requested information on the cybersecurity of the system.
Director James thanked DTP for being present and recognized that it was a
challenging time. He suggested in the short term staff prepare something
that quickly describes what happened so the Board is prepared to speak with
the public. In the longer term he would appreciate something in-depth about
what happened. He asked if this in-depth document could also outline what
the consequences to DTP’s payment would be, if any, as being helpful to
put everything in perspective. He also asked staff to prepare an update on
the at-grade crossings. General Manager Genova indicated staff would
prepare the information.
Director Hoy thought it would be good to receive information on the status
of the at-grade crossings as well because it is a real issue. He shared that
he recently took a radio personality on a trip along the University of Colorado
A-Line and it took about an hour to get to DIA. On the return trip the
gentleman timed it and the train was within 10 seconds of 37 minutes. As
to the reports on issues that are occurring, he asked staff to be sure and
indicate if something is a repeat of a previous or similar failure. He believes
it is important for the Board to know if there is something that keeps
breaking.
Director Hoy inquired if he was correct that the B-Line is powered from the
same power source as the University of Colorado A-Line. He wonders if it
an accurate assumption that if the University of Colorado A-Line goes down
so does the B-Line. Henry Stopplecamp stated all power comes from Xcel
and goes into two substations. He said if one substation goes down the
Packet Pg. 75

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 24, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

he does not plan to do so now. He said DTP’s Board asked if they could put
some thought into their response and get back to us.

6.H

other one should pick up the slack so the B-Line should still have power in
most instances.
Director Hoy pointed out that the B-Line is in testing right now. He asked if
the B-Line was still able to operate around the time of the University of
Colorado A-Line power failure. Arron Epstein stated he did not know what
operations were actually running at that time but knows they would be able
to run it.

Committee Chair Anderson thanked everyone for their time this evening.
She recognized that everyone wants the same thing which is a robust transit
system that works 100% pf the time. She acknowledged it has been a
tough week but everyone is working together.
Henry Stopplecamp stated it was a fantastic team from rail operations to
construction to engineering to finance. He said everyone wants the
University of Colorado A-Line to run well. The entire team is very dedicated.

• Lost Service Hours and Hiring Update
Bruce Abel indicated the Lost Service Hours and Hiring Update reports were
included in the May 25, 2016 Operations and Customer Service Committee
Agenda Packet. He highlighted that the lost hours of service was down to
178 hours for April as compared to 800-900 hours over the winter. He
believes they are making progress and noted that forced overtime was
beginning to be reduced.

D. Other Matters
Director Bagley shared he attended the APTA Bus and Paratransit Conference Last
week. He said the conference was very informative with great presentations. He
had the opportunity to see the Gillig and MCI buses and interact with the people
that build them. He attended an outstanding Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) presentation
that related to BRT across the country. He encouraged his fellow Board members
to attend these types of conferences as it is a great learning opportunity.
Committee Chair Anderson shared that she attended the APTA Transit Board
Member Seminar in San Antonio with Directors Hoy and Walker. She said there
were some excellent sessions on new Board member orientation. She further
commended the RTD Board staff for the great job they do.

May Board Meeting Agenda Review
Chair Tobiassen provided the initial review of the agenda and indicated it would be a quick
Board meeting as we only have a few items. He asked if there were any retirees attending
the Board Meeting and it was indicated the Debi Drewes was planning on attending.
Director Francone indicated she will do a brief review of the GM Oversight and
Performance Management Committee progress. Chair Tobiassen confirmed that the
committee reports and last month’s Board Meeting would be in the Board meeting packet
on Friday for all directors to review.
Chair Tobiassen moved on to the Unanimous Consent agenda for review and asked if there
were any questions on any of the items being presented. Director Deadwyler asked about
the appointment of the Salaried Employee Trustee Replacement as she needed clarification
on the structure. Chair Tobiassen explained the structure change and how it was
determined to address both of the salaried plans were and that they were equally
represented by an appropriate mix of staff from each specific plan. He went further to say

Chair Tobiassen asked to move onto the recommended action agenda and outlined the
items being considered. There was no discussion on the State Liaison Services. Director
Hoy asked about the Item I and wanted to confirm that the corridors listed SE Corridor and
Eagle P3 were the specific corridors listed in the resolution. Currently the GM Genova said
that was true the bonds would be utilized for the stated corridors. The Central corridor
and the SW corridor are not funded at this time.
Director Francone requested a short discussion regarding the ideology of funding the buses
at this time outlined in Resolution J as opposed to waiting to make the purchase and how
the funding would be paid back. GM Genova discussed the challenges of getting on the
schedule of having the buses built and moving forward would insure the delivery of the
vehicles needed when they are needed. Director Francone asked if staff was comfortable
that the bus vendor would be around for a period of time. GM Genova said he feels the
providers we are using now would be around for a while.
Chair Tobiassen moved on to the last recommended action the August 2016 Service
Changes. Director Deadwyler voiced some concern about how the bus constituents have
been lost with all the energy going to the train right now. She has said there are bus
scheduling concerns that need to addressed from April before we move on to additional
changes. GM Genova said he would have Jessie Carter look at some of the adjustments
that need to be made. Director Hoy mentioned that on the BRT routes needed changes in
January after the opening and the service planning group were very proactive in making
adjustments. Director Deadwyler said she would follow up on the problem routes
particularly northern Aurora and service to the Anschutz Campus. Director Francone said
she met with Jessie Carter in the afternoon to clarify the needs of her constituents are
being met. Director Menten and Director Hoy mentioned adjustments were made to the
bus schedules were made after the opening of the West Line and for the most part the
needs were met.
Motion: Director Deadwyler made the motion to
approve moving the May 31st Board agenda to the full
Board.
Director Hoy seconded the motion.

the entire committee is engaged in the process. Chair Tobiassen outlined how the

Lubow rolled off the committee in December. GM Genova said the vacancy for the new
member would be advertised in the Monday Morning Q and applications would be
reviewed for the perspective candidates.

Other Matters

GM Genova gave an update on the disruption problems on the A Line describing the
phase break problem and what they have done to remediate the problem. All
modifications were completed last evening, May 25th. The incident on Tuesday has
been resolved and a determination was made that a lightning strike caused the
disruption of service. Director Deadwyler asked why we need the phase break at all.
GM Genova said the design was questioned by our team but DTP made the decision
to move forward with the phase break. Director Hoy asked why they thought the
current design would be best. GM Genova noted there would be less maintenance
with the phase break design. Chair Tobiassen asked if we could move on as this is
a conversation we might have with the entire board.
Director Deadwyler said the new rail line openings should utilize external the
ambassadors in their areas. She indicated her constituents who were ambassadors
were very proud to be an honorary RTD employee for a period of time and to be
engaged in the community surrounding the opening of the A Line. She also gave
kudos and a special thank you Jessie Carter and Adrian Mabry for making it all
happen in her district.

Chair Tobiassen said the search would be internal and external as well as specific
transportation venues would be utilized. Director Menten asked why in the core
competencies it mentioned Collective Bargaining Agreement as no represented
employees were in the board office. It was explained that the competencies are
static and are the same for all salaried employees. Director Francone asked if we
were sure this description was ADA compliant. Chair Tobiassen said he always
encourages all to apply for the positions regardless of challenges. HR gives all the
opportunity for constituents to demonstrate skills. GM Genova said all of the jobs
go through a process to insure we are compliant.
Free Ride Coupon Audit

Chair Tobiassen shared a copy of the audit of the Free Ride Coupons and the current
Management Directive for review. He said he was very surprised at the dollar
amount and the number of these coupons being used by the agency. The

what they would like this to look like for the board office and for the agency as a
whole. There was discussion regarding how the members of the Executive
Committee utilize the Free Ride Tickets and how many were being used. Chair
Tobiassen said he would like to have the committee review the recommendations
and wanted them to have a heads up that changes were being made to this process
agency wide.

Retiree Awards
Special Recognition – TSA Gold Standard Award 2015
Chair Pro Tem Hoy announced there were no retirees this evening but there was a special
recognition for RTD’s Transit Police and Security Team who received the TSA Gold
Standard Award for the second consecutive year. He stated this is a very high accolade
for RTD. He shared that he recently was meeting with a member of the Colorado Highway
Patrol who said that RTD’ Security is top notch.
General Manager Genova explained that the TSA Gold Standard Award is given to
organizations demonstrating the highest standard of excellence in security. He pointed out
this is the second consecutive award that RTD has received, which is a great statement
for the efforts of the team lead by Chief Tarbert.
General Manager Genova pointed out that the team has been doing a great deal of
preparation for the University of Colorado A-Line Opening. The team put together an
extensive manual that has been circulated throughout our various law enforcement
partners. He looks forward to seeing them in action on Friday and Saturday.

V.

Public Participation
Chair Pro Tem Hoy stated public participation is open to anyone that wants to address the
Board. He reminded the audience that each speaker is allowed three minutes.
 Doug Gragg, Denver, congratulated everyone on the upcoming University of
Colorado A-Line opening. He has been looking forward to this line for years and
will have a wonderful time riding up and down the system. He shared that last
week he observed the Financial Administration and Audit Committee Meeting at
which the CU Leeds School of Business (Leeds) gave an economics presentation.
He expressed concern that Leeds kept saying there was low inflation. He stated
RTD cannot have Leeds come before this agency and say that inflation is low when
RTD raised fares at the first of the year. If inflation is low then RTD needs to lower
prices, not raise them.

Discussion:

Director Anderson stated she would be voting no for
the simple reason that she does not know where the
additional $2 million needed to meet the on-time
performance goal will come from. RTD has a finite
amount of financial resources and she cannot vote yes
until she knows how staff will balance the budget.
Director Menten pointed out that based on the
discussion during the Financial Administration and Audit
Committee there is nothing requiring an additional $2
million be spent. She does not want to lower RTD’s
standards, especially when the Board just approved
spending $26 million on the Civic Center renovations.
She wants to see on-time performance be a priority but
that does not mean the Board has approved spending
an additional $2 million.

Director Sisk echoed the comments of Director Bagley. He wanted to recognize Nate
Currey and Karen Benker, Citizens for Finishing FasTracks, who were on Colorado Public
Radio last week to discuss FasTracks. He thought it was a very enlightened discussion
that was handled well by all parties. He said Colorado Public Radio did a really good job
gathering background information.
Director Sisk shared that he recently had the honor of traveling to Washington, D.C. with
the US 36 Mayors and Commissioners Coalition (MCC). He stated it was a great trip and
people in D.C. are very excited about the University of Colorado A-Line. He thanked Bill
Van Meter, Assistant General Manager of Planning, for attending with him and doing the
heavy lifting. He also thanked Sherry Ellebracht, Government Relations Officer, for
providing background information so RTD was speaking together with the MCC. He thinks
it assists RTD immeasurably when we can present a united front to the outside with our
community partners.

Committee

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee and the Nominating Committee for the RTD
Citizens Advisory Committee of the Regional Transportation District (RTD) that the RTD Board of
Directors reappoint one member of the Committee to an additional three-year term and appoint five new
members to the Committee to a three-year term.
BACKGROUND
On April 22, 2004, the RTD Board of Directors adopted Resolution No. 5, Series of 2004, directing, in
part, staff to create a FasTracks Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC). On Dec.13, 2005, the RTD Board
of Directors approved the structure of the CAC including its mission and function, the duties and roles of
its members, the selection process for members, and organizational and meeting procedures for the
committee. On Dec. 16, 2008, the RTD Board of Directors increased the number of members of the
CAC from eleven to seventeen.
Since its creation in 2005, the mission of the CAC has been to review the progress of the FasTracks
Program in relation to established schedules, budget allocations, DBE goals and quality management
guidelines; to provide region-oriented advice to the Board of Directors on issues related to the
implementation of the FasTracks program; to review and provide comment on the DRCOG SB208
Annual Report; and to promote public awareness and understanding of the voter-approved FasTracks
program and its implementation. Six current members’ terms expired on December 31, 2015.
As the District completes more elements of the FasTracks Program, opens five new projects in 2016,
and works to integrate new rail service into existing operations, the issues that input from the CAC
would be relevant and meaningful to the District are increasingly agency-wide. Therefore, on February
16, 2016, based on the CAC’s individual meetings with board members conducted earlier this year,
input from staff and extensive discussion by the committee, the RTD Board of Directors RTD Board of
Directors change the name of the RTD FasTracks Citizens Advisory Committee to the RTD Citizens
Advisory Committee and revise the structure accordingly.
On February 18, 2016, recruitment for citizens interested in serving was publicly advertised through the
RTD and FasTracks Web sites, media releases, local publications and stakeholder e-mail distributions.
Applicants were asked to submit a one-page letter stating their interest in serving on the CAC along with
specific qualifications, highlights of related experience and expertise and a resume if available. A total of
45 applications were received by the March 31, 2016 deadline. Two current members were eligible for
reappointment and one expressed an interest in continuing to serve on the Committee.
The Nominating Committee decided, based on attendance, participation at meetings and Committee
consistency to recommend reappointment of the current member who requested reappointment. The
Nominating Committee then carefully reviewed each application using criteria outlined in the adopted
Committee Structure, including:

Contract Amendment for the Westminster Park
and Ride Pedestrian Bridge Painting &
Rehabilitation

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the
General Manager, or his designee, to enter into a construction contract amendment with TMI Coatings,
Inc. in the amount of $390,595.81. This Contract Amendment to the Westminster Park-N-Ride (PnR)
Pedestrian Bridge Painting & Rehabilitation Project (Contract No. 16DP001) is for the restoration of the
adjoining access ramps to the pedestrian bridge over US36 at the RTD US36 Sheridan Bus Rapid Transit
(BRT) Station. With this amendment, the total contract value would be $839,283.74
BACKGROUND
The Westminster Center (US36 & Sheridan Bus Rapid Transit Station) Pedestrian Bridge over US36 was
constructed in 1995. It is a steel truss bridge structure with a concrete deck and enclosed pedestrian
walkway. Circular steel and concrete pedestrian access ramps on both ends of the bridge were
constructed at the same time. The bridge and ramps were originally painted federal green. In 2001, the
Westminster Center Park n Ride parking garage structure was constructed on the Boulder-bound side of
US36. A steel and concrete deck ramp extension was placed between the garage and the north access
ramp. Some maintenance has been performed on the bridge and ramps. A 2014 inspection revealed
areas of rust and concrete damage that require rehabilitation. The federal green paint has, over time,
flaked and salts including magnesium chloride have eaten away various areas of the coating; the
exposed steel is rusting. See Figures 1 and 2 (below) for project location.
DISCUSSION
A Request For Proposals (RFP) and construction plans and specifications were issued in February 2016
in order to solicit quality proposals from reputable contractors who were qualified and properly certified
in the rehabilitation of pedestrian bridges and ramps. Because of funding concerns, the pedestrian
bridge was designated as a base bid and the ramps were designated as an “add alternate.”
The responding contractors provided experience and qualification evidence for: (a) Site investigations
and materials testing; (b) Restoration and construction options; (c) Preparing structural steel member
surfaces (i.e., clean and remove rust); (d) Paint complex steel structural members above a highway; (e)
Prepare and repair reinforced concrete deck; (f) Prepare and repair reinforced concrete structural
supports; (g) Remove and replace broken downspouts and gutters; (h) Apply concrete deck coating; (i)
Recent experience on similar projects with government agencies (j) Provide safe and efficient highway
traffic control, vehicular and pedestrian detours; (k) Ensure public safety, structural integrity and
continued reliability of existing infrastructure; (l) Schedule and manage regular construction meetings;
(m) Administer contracts, construction management, invoices, inspection reports and other construction
related services; (n) Assist RTD staff with site inspections; (o) Coordinate proposed work with local,
state and federal agencies including obtaining work permits.

Packet Pg. 96

11.B

The evaluation criteria included technical merits, experience, personnel and cost, weighted as follows:
 40%: knowledge, certification and technical experience, Quality Assurance/Quality Control,
structural concrete repair, highway and pedestrian traffic control, and safety.
 20%: experience and project understanding, recent similar work, coordination with government,
coordination with subcontractors and strength of organizational chart.
 40%: cost.
Proposals were accepted March 25, 2016 from three prime contractors:
(1) Gonzales Custom Painting, Inc.;
(2) TMI Coatings, Inc.;
(3) RMA Group, Inc.
A technical evaluation committee of five RTD staff members independently reviewed and rated each
proposal. A final evaluation and recommendation meeting occurred April 6, 2016. TMI Coatings, Inc.
was recommended as the most technically qualified, and had a mid-range cost that is within the project
budget.
Because of the best value determination, an award of $448,687.93 was made for the base bid. The
contract duration is 180 calendar days.
The base bid contract award will restore the bridge as follows: (1) prepare and paint steel members dark
grey, as accepted by RTD and the City of Westminster; (2) replace clear Lexan side panels; (3) remove
chain link fence; (4) patch and coat concrete decks with a skid resistant material.
This contract amendment will restore the adjoining ramps as follows; (1) repair the concrete support
columns under the Denver-bound side of US36; (2) replace the rain gutters and downspouts; (3) replace
the green vinyl clad chain link fence with grey galvanized chain link fence; (4) treat and coat the stay-inplace metal formwork of the ramp decks located over walkways; (5) patch and coat the concrete decks
with a skid resistant material.
The add alternate for this contract amendment was included in the contractor’s base bid, and will not
increase the contract duration.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
This contract amendment will utilize currently budgeted US36 BRT Local Expense funds.
PROJECT SBE GOAL
A 6% SBE goal was established by RTD. The contractor exceeded this goal for the overall project base
bid and add alternate. The base bid and add alternate amount of $839,283.74, which includes
$57,533.00 SBE work for traffic control, glazing and fencing, provides a 6.86% SBE participation.

Delay implementing the Recommended Action: Instead, reissue a new set of plans and
specifications and issue a separate Invitation for Bid for the access ramps. This is not
recommended because:
a. It delays the access ramp restoration that is needed for repair and aesthetic appearance.
b. The current accepted contractor, TMI Coatings, Inc., will perform a complete “turn-key”
project, which is determined to be the most qualified with a fair and reasonable price.
c. The Engineering Division and the Procurement Office do not believe that a separate bidding
process will give better results. A better quality of the work is anticipated with this approach.
d. The funds are currently available.
Do not award: This is not recommended because the deteriorated condition of the pedestrian
ramps, downspouts, gutters and concrete are approaching a safety concern.

Pass Program Working Group

Assistant

General

Board Meeting Date: May 31, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors approves
and adopts the Pass Program Working Group objective, commitments and guiding principles.
BACKGROUND
In September of 2015, the Board of Directors approved a fare level increase to the Business and
Neighborhood Eco Pass programs and directed to staff to establish a Pass Program Working Group. The
Board Action approved in September of 2015 specifically stated: “This working group will include RTD
staff as well as stakeholders from across the District. The working group will define goals for pass
programs as well as reevaluate the 2009 Board policy for utilization based pricing to incorporate the new
fare structure and average fare analysis once smart card tap data is available.”
Staff prepared a draft of an objective, commitments and guiding principles to set the course of the Pass
Program Working Group. At the February 2016 Planning and Development Board Committee meeting,
staff presented and received input from the Board on that draft. Input received from individual Board
Directors confirmed that the draft objective, commitments and guiding principles did reflect their
priorities and concerns regarding Pass Programs.
DISCUSSION
It is important that Staff receive Board approval of the objective, commitments and guiding principles of
the Pass Program Working Group prior to the establishment of the group. These directional elements will
lead the efforts of Staff and the working group. The recommended objective, commitments and guiding
principles are detailed below.
Objective: Improve RTD pass programs to better serve customers of the district.
To achieve this objective, the Pass Program Working Group will fulfill the following commitments:
1. Revisit and refine goals for each individual pass program.
2. Refine pricing and administration of each pass program.
3. Recommend pass program policy revisions to the Board of Directors.
Below is a list of the Guiding Principles for the Pass Program Study:
1. Cost Effective Administration
2. Equitable Access
3. Improve Customer Convenience
4. Increase Ridership
5. Meet Strategic Budget Plan Revenue Targets
6. Promote Greater Brand Loyalty
7. Provide RTD revenue certainty
8. Simplify Passenger-Operator Interaction

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
accept and enter into the record the District’s audited financial reports relating to the year ended
December 31, 2015 as prepared by staff and audited by RTD's independent auditor, RubinBrown, LLP.
BACKGROUND
State statutes require an annual audit by independent certified public accountants. RTD is also required
to provide annual audited financial statements to external entities and other government organizations to
be in full compliance with legal covenants, debt agreements, and other contractual documents. The
accounting firm of RubinBrown, LLP performed the 2015 audit. In addition to the requirements set forth
in state statutes, the audit also was designed to fulfill the requirements of the federal Single Audit Act of
1984 and related OMB circular A-133.
DISCUSSION
As stated in the auditor’s unmodified opinion, the financial statements in the enclosed Comprehensive
Annual Financial Report (CAFR) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of RTD as of
December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of its operations and its cash flow for the 2015 and
2014 fiscal years in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept and enter into the record RTD’s audited financial reports relating to the year ended
December 31, 2015 as prepared by staff and audited by RTD's independent auditor, RubinBrown,
LLP. This is the recommended action, state statutes and other sources, such as rating agencies
and other legal covenants, require RTD to enter annual audited financial statements into the
record.
2. Do not accept and enter into the record the audited financial reports relating to the year ended
December 31, 2015 as prepared by staff and audited by RTD’s independent auditor, RubinBrown,
LLP. This is not the recommended action, since state statutes and other sources, such as rating
agencies and other legal covenants, require RTD to enter annual audited financial statements into
the record.

Board of Directors
Regional Transportation District
Denver, Colorado
In accordance with Colorado statutes and Regional Transportation District (RTD) bylaws, the enclosed Comprehensive Annual
Financial Report of the Regional Transportation District as of December 31, 2015, has been compiled. Responsibility for the
accuracy of the presented data and the completeness and fairness of the presentation, including all disclosures, rests with RTD.
Management believes the data, as presented, fairly sets forth the financial position and operating results of RTD. Disclosures
necessary to enable the reader to gain the maximum understanding of the financial affairs of RTD have been included.
In developing and evaluating RTD’s accounting system, consideration has been given to the adequacy of internal accounting controls.
These controls are discussed by the Chief Financial Officer in the Letter of Transmittal. Within that framework, we believe RTD’s
internal accounting controls adequately safeguard assets and provide reasonable assurance of the proper recording of financial
transactions.
This report has been prepared according to the guidelines recommended by the Government Finance Officers Association of the
United States and Canada. In accordance with these guidelines, the accompanying report is presented in three parts:
1.

Introductory Section, including the Chief Financial Officer’s Letter of Transmittal.

2.

Financial Section containing the independent auditor’s report, Management’s Discussion and Analysis, the financial
statements, notes thereto and supplemental information.

3.

Statistical Section, including selected tables of unaudited data depicting the financial history of RTD, demographics, and
other miscellaneous information.

Colorado law requires the governing bodies of local governments to have an independent audit of RTD’s financial statements
performed. RTD has complied with this requirement and has included the report of the independent auditors in the Financial Section
of this report.
Preparation of this Comprehensive Annual Financial Report could not have been accomplished without the dedicated efforts of the
entire financial staff. Should you have any questions or comments, please contact me or Heather Copp, Chief Financial Officer.
Respectfully submitted,

Mr. Tom Tobiassen
Chair, Executive Committee
Regional Transportation District
State law requires that all general-purpose local governments publish within seven months of the close of each fiscal year a
complete set of financial statements presented in conformance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and
audited in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards by a firm of licensed certified public accountants. Pursuant
to that requirement, we hereby issue the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report of the Regional Transportation District
(RTD) for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.
This report consists of management’s representations concerning the finances of RTD. Consequently, management assumes
full responsibility for the completeness and reliability of all of the information presented in this report. To provide a reasonable
basis for making these representations, management of RTD has established a comprehensive internal control framework that
is designed both to protect the government’s assets from loss, theft, or misuse and to compile sufficient, reliable information
for the preparation of RTD’s financial statements in conformity with GAAP. Because the cost of internal controls should not
outweigh their benefits, RTD’s comprehensive framework of internal controls has been designed to provide reasonable rather
than absolute assurance that the financial statements will be free from material misstatement. As management, we assert
that, to the best of our knowledge and belief, this financial report is complete and reliable in all material respects.
RTD’s financial statements have been audited by RubinBrown, LLP, a firm of licensed certified public accountants. The goal of
the independent audit was to provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements of RTD for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2015, are free of material misstatement. The independent audit involved examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements; assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management; and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. The independent auditor
concluded, based upon the audit, that there was a reasonable basis for rendering an unmodified opinion that RTD’s financial
statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, are fairly presented in conformity with GAAP. The independent
auditor’s report is presented as the first component of the Financial Section of this report.
The independent audit of the financial statements of RTD was part of a broader, federally mandated “Single Audit” designed
to meet the special needs of federal grantor agencies. The standards governing Single Audit engagements require the
independent auditor to report not only on the fair presentation of the financial statements, but also on the audited
government’s internal controls and compliance with legal requirements, with special emphasis on internal controls and legal
requirements involving the administration of federal awards. These reports are in RTD’s separately issued Single Audit Report.
GAAP requires that management provide a narrative introduction, overview, and analysis to accompany the basic financial
statements in the form of Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A). This letter of transmittal is designed to
complement the MD&A and should be read in conjunction with it. RTD’s MD&A can be found immediately following the
report of the independent auditors.
REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT (RTD)
RTD provides public mass transit service to the Denver metropolitan area. In 1969, the Colorado General Assembly
(Assembly) found that public transit was a necessary part of the growing Denver Metropolitan Region. The Assembly found

RTD boundaries now include Jefferson, Boulder, and Denver counties, most of the City and County of Broomfield, and
portions of Adams, Douglas, Weld, and Arapahoe counties. Over 2.87 million people, or approximately 57% of the population
of Colorado, reside within RTD’s 2,340 square mile area.
Since 1983, RTD has had a fifteen-member Board of Directors that are elected by their constituents to serve four-year terms
to govern RTD. There are approximately 190,000 voters per director district. The RTD Board of Directors is responsible for
setting policy, overseeing the agency’s annual budget, and establishing short and long-range transit goals and plans in
concert with local, state, and federal agencies.
RTD employs over 2,700 men and women, making it one of the largest employers in the eight county areas. In addition, RTD
contracts with private carriers to provide access-a-ride and fixed route services employing over 1,700 men and women.
Besides its administrative headquarters in Denver, RTD has six operating facilities, including three in Denver, one in Aurora,
one in Englewood, and one in Boulder.
The financial reporting entity includes all of the financial activities of RTD, as well as those activities of its component unit,
the Asset Acquisition Authority, Inc. (the Authority), a nonprofit corporation established to facilitate RTD’s use of
lease/purchase financing.
RTD also maintains budgetary controls. These controls ensure compliance with legal provisions embodied in the annual
appropriated budget approved by RTD’s Board of Directors. The budget sets forth proposed outlays for operations, planning,
administration, development, debt service, and capital assets. The level of budgetary control (that is, the level at which
expenditures cannot legally exceed the appropriated amount) is established at the project level.
The annual budget serves as the foundation for RTD’s financial planning and control. All departments of RTD are required to
submit requests for appropriation to the General Manager on or before August 1st of each year. The General Manager uses
these requests as the starting point for developing a proposed budget. The General Manager then presents this proposed
budget to the Board of Directors for review prior to October 15th. The Board of Directors is required to hold a public hearing
on the proposed budget and to adopt a final budget no later than December 31st.
Unused appropriations lapse at year end, except that the Board of Directors has the authority, as stated in the adopted
appropriation resolution, to carry-over the unused portion of the funds for capital projects not completed, for a period not to
exceed three years.
RTD’s policy also authorizes the General Manager to approve certain line-item transfers within the budget. Budget-to-actual
comparisons are provided in the Supplemental Information Section of this report.
Factors Affecting Financial Condition
The information presented in the financial statements is perhaps best understood when it is considered in the broader
perspective of the specific environment within which RTD operates.
RTD serves the eight-county region considered the Denver metropolitan area. It is the most populated area of the state and
the economic barometer of Colorado. Employment in the Denver Metro area is dominated by small businesses. These
companies represent a diverse mix of industries and are located throughout the Denver metropolitan area, providing a
geographic balance in employment centers.

Attachment: 1.A 2015 RTD Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (05-2016) (2792 : 2015 CAFR and Report to Governance)

that public sector involvement was the best method to ensure the continuation of this vital component. Thus, the Regional
Transportation District was created as a political subdivision of the State effective July 1969 “to develop, maintain, and
operate a public mass transportation system for the benefit of the District.”

On November 3, 1992, the voters of Colorado approved a Constitutional Amendment (the “Amendment”) that limits taxes,
revenue, and spending for state and local governments effective December 31, 1992. On November 7, 1995, the voters of
the District exempted RTD from the revenue and spending limitations concerning the Amendment through December 31,
2005. On November 2, 1999, the voters of the District further exempted RTD from the revenue and spending limitations
outlined in the Amendment for the purpose of paying any debt incurred to finance the construction of the Southeast and
Southwest light rail lines or to operate such for as long as any debt remains outstanding, but in no event beyond
December 31, 2026.
On November 2, 2004, the voters of the District authorized an increase in the District’s sales and use tax rate from 0.6% to
1.0%, effective January 1, 2005, to finance the FasTracks transit improvement program. This authorization also exempted
the District from any revenue and spending limitations on the additional tax and on any investment income generated by the
increased tax revenue, and allowed RTD to incur debt to finance the capital improvements included in the FasTracks
program. At the time that all FasTracks debt is repaid, the District’s sales and use tax rate will be reduced to a rate
sufficient to operate the transit system financed through FasTracks.
Long-term Financial Planning
Each year the Board of Directors adopts a financially constrained Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) which is the six-year operating
and capital improvement plan of RTD. It reflects RTD’s plans for service and capital improvements excluding FasTracks. In
November 2010, the Board of Directors convened a Fiscal Sustainability Task Force for the purpose of developing a formal
written report that was submitted to the Board of Directors in June 2011, detailing opportunities for operating efficiencies
and revenue enhancements to ensure RTD’s fiscal sustainability in the long term. The Task Force consisted of 21 members
from RTD management, the Board of Directors and the public and private sector. The Board of Directors gave approval to
management to pursue implementation of the Task Force’s recommendations. The SBP includes those recommendations that
have been implemented in the SBP timeframe, most notably an operational service adjustment, enhanced sales and use tax
forecasts and implementation of a revised fund balance policy which was implemented in 2013.
In addition to the SBP, RTD is planning and constructing the build-out of the FasTracks transit expansion plan. FasTracks
entails the addition of new bus rapid transit, light-rail lines and commuter rail lines, the redevelopment of Denver Union
Station, and expanded bus service throughout the eight county District. Each year, RTD conducts a comprehensive
evaluation of the entire FasTracks program, called an Annual Program Evaluation. RTD has worked closely with elected
officials, local governments, corridor stakeholders and the public to move the FasTracks program forward.
FINANCIAL INFORMATION
RTD management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an internal control structure designed to ensure that assets
are protected from loss, theft, or misuse and that adequate accounting data are compiled to allow for the preparation of
financial statements in conformity with GAAP. RTD has designed its internal control structure to provide reasonable, but not
absolute, assurance that these objectives are met. The concept of reasonable assurance recognizes that: (1) the costs of a

The Colorado Legislative Council (CLC) in its December 2015 report forecasts that the economy is expected to grow at a
more moderate place, reflecting slower economic growth. Economists for CLC reported the following key economic
indicators:

Packet Pg. 121

11.D.a

Single Audit: As a recipient of federal assistance, RTD is responsible for ensuring that an adequate internal control
structure is instituted to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations related to those programs. This internal
control structure is subject to periodic evaluation by management and the RTD internal audit staff.
As part of RTD’s single audit, tests are made to determine the adequacy of the internal control structure, including that
portion related to federal financial assistance programs, as well as to evaluate RTD’s compliance. RTD’s single audit for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 found no instances of material weakness in the internal control structures or
significant violations of applicable laws and regulations. A separate report was prepared for this purpose.
Fiscal Policy: RTD follows a fiscal policy approved by the Board of Directors annually or as necessary due to modification.
The fiscal policy contains policies for revenue, investments, expenditures, capital improvements, fund balance, debt,
budgeting, accounting and grants. In 2012, RTD modified its fund balance policy to establish a structure that was
recommended by the RTD Fiscal Sustainability Task Force as being a necessary tool in designating funds to be available for
specific purposes to ensure fiscal sustainability.
Debt Administration: RTD formulates its debt policy to protect its credit ratings and soundly manage its assets and
liabilities. Included in this policy is a requirement that debt will not be used to finance current operations. Another
requirement precludes financing capital projects beyond the useful life of the project. Additional policies go beyond these
essential guidelines and result in further protection. RTD has a dual rating for its 1.0% sales tax credit. Moody’s Investors
Service rates the sales tax credit as “Aa2”, Standard and Poor’s Corporation rates the sales tax credit “AAA” and Fitch
Ratings rates the sales tax credit “AA+” that are secured by the 0.6% sales tax. Moody’s Investors Service rates the sales
tax credit as “Aa2”, Standard and Poor’s Corporation rates the sales tax credit “AA+” and Fitch Ratings rates the sales tax
credit “AA” that are secured by the 0.4% sales tax.
Cash Management: The main objective of RTD’s cash management program is the protection of investment principal while
providing optimal levels of cash throughout the year. The RTD investment policy is modified periodically to adapt to changes
in eligible investments, benchmarks, and specific objectives.
During the year, RTD invested its cash in various investment vehicles including money market funds, U.S. Treasury securities,
agency securities, discount notes, commercial paper, repurchase agreements, and variable and fixed rate mortgage-backed
securities. The total average return on investments for the year was 0.5%.
Risk Management: RTD employs a combination of self-insurance and purchased insurance in its efforts to protect assets
and control and prevent losses.
The areas of self-insurance are worker’s compensation, automobile and general liability. RTD is self-insured for liability, the
limits of which are $350,000 per person and $990,000 per occurrence as specified under the Colorado Governmental
Immunity statute. The self-insured retention for worker’s compensation claims is $2,000,000 per claim, with any amounts
above this covered by purchased insurance up to the legal limits of liability under the Colorado worker’s compensation
statute.
Commercial insurance policies provide property coverage up to $1,663,245,896 for buildings, their contents, and rolling
stock (other than collision); a Commercial Crime Policy and Faithful Performance Bond; a $3,500,000 Workers’
Compensation Bond; Felonious Assault Policy; travel insurance for employees on RTD business; fidelity coverage on the
Trustees of the Union Pension Trust, Salaried Pension Trust, Represented Health and Welfare Union Trust, Legal Trust, and
the employees administering the health benefits program for salaried employees. With the growth of Light Rail Transit (LRT)
services, RTD has added Railroad Protective and Railroad Liability commercial insurance policies that provide coverage when
required under operational needs.

control should not exceed the benefits likely to be derived and (2) the valuation of costs and benefits requires estimates and
judgment by management.

OTHER INFORMATION
Independent Audit: State statutes require an annual audit by independent certified public accountants. The accounting firm
of RubinBrown LLP was selected to perform the 2015 audit. This audit also was designated to meet the requirements of the
Federal Single Audit 2 CFR 200.501, Uniform Grant Guidance and related 2 CFR 200, Uniform Grant Guidance – Uniform
Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles and Audit Requirements. The auditor’s report on the financial statements and
schedules are included in the Financial Section of this report. The auditor’s report related specifically to the single audit is
included in a separate report.
Awards: The Government Finance Officers Associations (GFOA) awarded a Certificate of Achievement for Excellence in
Financial Reporting to RTD for its Comprehensive Annual Financial Report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014. This
is the twenty-third consecutive year, after a two-year absence from the program, that RTD has been awarded this
prestigious award.
In order to receive the Certificate of Achievement for Excellence in Financial Reporting, RTD must publish an easily readable
and efficiently organized Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the contents of which must conform to program standards.
This report must also satisfy both GAAP and applicable legal requirements.
The Certificate of Achievement is valid for one year only. We believe our current Comprehensive Annual Financial Report
meets the program’s requirements and will be submitting it to the GFOA to determine its eligibility for another certificate.
Acknowledgements: Preparation of the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report on a timely basis was made possible by
the dedicated services of the entire staff of the Finance Division. Each member of the division has our sincere appreciation
for the contributions made in the preparation of this report.
Finally, without the leadership and support of the members of the RTD’s Board of Directors, preparation of this report would
not have been possible.
Sincerely,
Heather Copp
Chief Financial Officer

Report On The Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of Regional Transportation
District (RTD) as of and for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 and the
related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise RTD’s basic
financial statements as listed in the table of contents.
Management’s Responsibility For The Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial
statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America; this includes the design, implementation and maintenance of
internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditors’ Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our
audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial
audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General
of the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from
material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the
auditors’ judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of
the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk
assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation
and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. Accordingly, we express no
such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting
policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to
provide a basis for our audit opinion.

Opinion
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of RTD as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the
changes in its financial position and its cash flows for the years then ended in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.
Emphasis Of Matters
As discussed in Note A.19, the Board adopted the provisions of the Governmental
Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Statement No. 68, Accounting and Financial
Reporting for Pensions-An Amendment of GASB No. 27, effective July 1, 2014. Our
opinions were not modified with respect to this matter.
Other Matters
Required Supplementary Information
Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that
the management’s discussion and analysis and pension plan summary information on
pages 23 through 34 and 80 through 85, respectively, be presented to supplement the
basic financial statements. Such information, although not a part of the basic financial
statements, is required by GASB, which considers it to be an essential part of financial
reporting for placing the basic financial statements in an appropriate operational,
economic or historical context. We have applied certain limited procedures to the
required supplementary information in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America, which consisted of inquiries of management
about the methods of preparing the information and comparing the information for
consistency with management’s responses to our inquiries, the basic financial
statements and other knowledge we obtained during our audit of the basic financial
statements. We do not express an opinion or provide any assurance on the information
because the limited procedures do not provide us with sufficient evidence to express an
opinion or provide any assurance.
Supplementary And Other Information
Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the financial
statements that collectively comprise RTD’s basic financial statements. The
accompanying budgetary information, summary schedules, introductory section and
statistical section are presented for purposes of additional analysis and are not a
required part of the basic financial statements.

The budgetary information is the responsibility of management and was derived from
and relates directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the
basic financial statements. Such information has been subjected to the auditing
procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements and certain additional
procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the
underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements
or to the basic financial statements themselves, and other additional procedures in
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America.
In our opinion, the budgetary information is fairly stated, in all material respects, in
relation to the financial statements as a whole.
The summary schedules, introductory and statistical sections have not been subjected
to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements, and
accordingly, we do not express an opinion or provide any assurance on them.
Other Reporting Required By Government Auditing Standards
In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report
dated May 5, 2016 on our consideration of RTD’s internal control over financial
reporting and on our tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations,
contracts and grant agreements and other matters. The purpose of that report is to
describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting and
compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on internal
control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an
audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering
RTD’s internal control over financial reporting and compliance.

The management of the Regional Transportation District (RTD) offers users of our financial statements this narrative overview and
analysis of the financial activities for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. This discussion and analysis is designed to assist
the reader to focus on significant financial activities and identify any significant changes in the financial position of RTD. It should be read
in conjunction with the financial statements that follow this section. All amounts, unless otherwise indicated, are expressed in thousands
of dollars.
Key Reporting Implementations
In fiscal year 2015 RTD implemented the provisions of GASB Statement No. 68, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions, and
GASB Statement 71, Pension Transition for Contributions Made Subsequent to the Measurement Date. GASB Statement Nos. 68 and 71
establish standards for measuring and recognizing net pension liabilities, deferred outflows of resources, deferred inflows of resources,
and expenses related to pension benefits provided through defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans.
Financial Highlights
As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, total assets and deferred outflows of resources of RTD exceeded total liabilities and deferred
inflows of resources by $3,176,938 and $3,181,074, respectively. The amount of unrestricted net position as of December 31, 2015
was $(199,265) compared to $18,842 in 2014. RTD’s unrestricted net position was negatively impacted by the implementation of GASB
Statement No. 68, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions (GASB 68). GASB 68 required RTD to record the amount of
unfunded pension liabilities. More information on the pension plans is available in the Notes starting on page 59.
The net position of RTD decreased by $4,136 during the current year compared to an increase of $203,625 in the previous year. The
decrease in 2015 was the result of the GASB 68 new financial reporting requirement. The increase for 2014 was due to higher operating
revenues, sales and use tax and grant revenues, net of increases in operating expenses and non-operating expenses which resulted from
an improving economy combined with revenue enhancement and expense reduction initiatives undertaken by RTD.
RTD’s sales and use tax revenues are its largest single source of revenues. These tax revenues increased $26,797 (5.2%) in 2015 and
increased $46,135 (9.8%) in the previous year due to broad-based increases in retail sales within the District as the local economy
emerges from the recession.
For 2015, total operating expenses exceeded total revenues resulting in a loss before non-operating revenue and expenses of $535,478
compared to a loss of $534,199 for 2014. The increase in operating loss for 2015 was due to the increased cost of salaries and fringe
benefits. RTD anticipates operating losses, as these losses are subsidized by non-operating sales and use tax, grant revenues and other
miscellaneous income.
RTD’s total debt increased $230,096 (7.1%) and increased $501,624 (18.5%) in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Debt increased in 2015
due to issuance of certificates of participation for the purpose of funding scheduled acquisition of equipment, buses and light rail vehicles.
Debt increased in 2014 due to the issuance of certificates of participation primarily for the purpose of funding of construction of North
Metro Rail Line as well as well as borrowings on the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) bond for
construction of the FasTracks project elements.
Capital grants and local contributions decreased $37,118 (18.0%) in 2015 and decreased $36,135 (14.9%) in the previous year. The
decrease in 2015 occurred as a result of several major construction project being completed, U.S. 36 Manages Lanes, Denver Union
Station, and West Rail Line, reducing grant funding. The decrease in 2014 occurred as a result of the reduced contributed capital from the
Denver Union Station construction project which was completed in 2014.
RTD’s capital assets, excluding depreciation, increased $798,324 in 2015 and increased $814,250 in 2014. The increase in 2015 was
primarily due to the build-out of Fastracks project. The increase in 2014 was from replacement of fleet and build-out of Fastracks
project.

Basic Financial Statements
Management’s Discussion and Analysis serves as an introduction to RTD’s basic financial statements. RTD’s financial statements are
prepared using proprietary fund (enterprise fund) accounting that uses the same basis of accounting as private-sector business
enterprises. Under this method of accounting, an economic resources measurement focus and an accrual basis of accounting is used.
Revenue is recorded when earned and expenses are recorded when incurred.
The basic financial statements are comprised of four components: statements of net position; statements of revenues, expenses and
changes in net position; statements of cash flows; and notes to the financial statements.
The statements of net position presents information on assets and deferred outflows of resource and liabilities and deferred inflows of
resources, with the difference between the two reported as the net position. Over time, increases or decreases in net position may serve
as a useful indicator of whether the financial position of RTD is improving or deteriorating. The statements of revenues, expenses, and
changes in net position presents information on operating revenues and expenses and non-operating revenues and expenses of RTD for the
fiscal year with the difference, the net income or loss, combined with any capital grants and local contributions to determine the change
in net position for the year. That change combined with the previous year-end total net position reconciles to the net position total at the
end of the current fiscal year. All changes in net position are reported as soon as the underlying event giving rise to the changes occurs,
regardless of the timing of the related cash flows.
The statements of cash flows reports cash and cash equivalent activities for the fiscal year resulting from operating activities, capital,
and related financing activities, noncapital and related financing activities and investing activities. The result of these activities added to
the beginning of the year cash balance reconciles to the cash and cash equivalents balance at the end of the current fiscal year. The
statements of cash flows, along with the related notes and information in other financial statements, can be used to assess the following:
RTD’s ability to generate positive cash flows and pay its debt as the debt matures; the reasons for differences between RTD’s operating
cash flows and operating income (loss); and the effect of investing, capital, and financing activities on RTD’s financial position.
The notes to the financial statements provide additional information that is essential to fully understand the data provided in the
statement of net position, statement of revenues, expenses, and changes in net position, and statement of cash flows.
RTD provides bus, paratransit, and light rail service in a 2,340 square mile area in and around Denver, Colorado. The activities of RTD are
supported by a 0.6% and 0.4% sales and use tax collected within the District. The 0.6% sales and use tax is used to fund the Base
System operations of RTD. The Base System operations provide the bus and the majority of current light rail services in the Denver area.
The 0.4% sales and use tax funds the FasTracks build-out program and operation and maintenance of those program elements as well as
providing for enhanced transit services in the District. Additional revenue sources include fare collections, federal, state, and local
financial assistance, investment income, and other income such as advertising and rental income.
Financial Analysis
Condensed Financial Information - Condensed financial information from the statements of net position and statements of revenues,
expenses, and changes in net position is presented below.
Statements of Net Position – As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, total assets and deferred outflows of resources of RTD exceeded
total liabilities and deferred inflows of resources by $3,176,938 and $3,181,074, respectively. The largest portion of this excess, in
2015 and in 2014, was invested in capital assets, net of related debt. RTD uses these capital assets to provide public transportation
services to customers; consequently, these assets are not available for future spending. Although RTD’s investment in capital assets
is reported net of related debt, it should be noted that funding required to repay this debt will be obtained from other sources such as
sales and use tax, since the capital assets themselves cannot be used to pay the related debt. The amount of unrestricted net position
as of December 31, 2015 was $(199,265) compared to $18,842 in 2014. Substantially all of the unrestricted net position, although
not legally restricted, has been appropriated or reserved by the RTD Board for future capital acquisition and reserve policy

requirements, and debt liquidation during the budget process. The deficit balance in Unrestricted Net Position includes an allowance
for a Net Pension Liability of $284,175 in 2015 for the represented employee defined benefit pension plan (see Note I). RTD has
recognized this liability in its financial statements in accordance with GASB Statement 68; however, RTD is current in making all
required contributions under the collective bargaining agreement.

In 2015, capital assets net of accumulated depreciation increased $718,153 (13.3%) for acquisition of revenue equipment, buildings,
land, and construction in progress for the projects in the FasTracks program.
Current liabilities decreased $23,119 (7.4%) in 2015 primarily due to an accrued lower construction payment for the FasTracks Eagle P3
project to the project concessionaire due in early 2016.
Noncurrent liabilities and deferred inflows increased $570,097 (16.8%) primarily due implementation of GASB Statement No. 68,
Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions, and GASB Statement 71, Pension Transition for Contributions Made Subsequent to the
Measurement Date. In addition, to the issuance of certificates of participation for acquisition of equipment, buses, light rail vehicles.
The net position of RTD decreased by $4,136 during the current year compared to an increase of $203,625 in the previous year. The
decrease in 2015 was the result of GASB 68 new financial reporting requirement. The increases in 2014 was due to higher operating
revenues, grant revenue income and sales and use tax collection increases, net of increases in operating expenses and non-operating
expenses.

Passenger fares – Passenger fares provided 13.0% and 12.8% of total revenues in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Farebox receipts,
monthly and annual pass revenue, and special event fares for bus and rail services are included in passenger fares. Passenger fares
increased by $33 (0%) in 2015 compared to an increase of $2,656 (2.3%) in 2014. Passenger fares changes in 2015 were minimal. The
increase in 2014 was due in part, to full year of revenue service of the West Line light rail line which opened in April 2013.
Advertising and other – Advertising and other revenue provided 0.6% and 0.5% of total revenues in 2015 and 2014; this includes
revenues from advertisements primarily on RTD’s buses and external wraps on light rail vehicles. Advertising and other income increased
$941 (21.4%) in 2015 compared to a decrease of $793 (15.3%) in 2014. The increase in 2015 was due an increase in advertising
revenue related to a stronger economic growth. The decrease in 2014 was primarily due to reduced joint venture revenue contracts.
Sales and Use Tax – Sales and use tax provided 58.6% and 54.8% of RTD’s total revenues in 2015 and 2014 respectively. Sales and
use tax is a dedicated 1.0% tax imposed on certain sales within the service area. Sales and use tax increased $26,797 (5.2%) in 2015
compared to an increase of $46,135 (9.8%) in 2014. In 2015 and 2014, the District experienced growth in tax revenues due to increased
consumer and business spending activity as the local economy continues to emerge from the recession.
Grant operating assistance – Grant operating assistance provided 7.9% and 8.0% of total revenues in 2015 and 2014. Grant
operating assistance decreased $2,161 (2.9%) in 2015 compared to a decrease of $12,699 (14.4%) in 2014. The operating assistance is
a federal grant revenue program used to perform capital maintenance and maintain RTD’s revenue fleet of bus, paratransit, and rail
vehicles. The decrease in 2015 and 2014 is the result of grant funding sources being available during the year.
Investment Income – Investment income provided 0.34% and 0.02% of total revenues in 2015 and 2014. Investment income increased
$2,999 (1817.6%) in 2015 compared to a decrease of $1,875 (91.9%) in 2014. The increase in 2015 was due to fixed securities getting
better yields in 2015 and progressively higher investment balances. The decrease in 2014 was due to lower investment balance as
invested funds are being utilized for the build-out of the FasTracks project in addition to unrealized losses attributed to mark-to-market
valuation under a rising interest rate environment.
Other Income/Gain on sale of Assets – Other income provided 1.2% and 1.8% of total revenues in 2015 and 2014. Other income
decreased $5,454 (32.3%) in 2015 compared to an increase of $11,309 (40.1%) in 2014. Other income includes interest subsidy income,
rental income from retail space, parking, and miscellaneous other items. The decrease in 2015 was due to reduction of asset sales which
was primarily attributable to the Denver Union Stations land parcels sold 2014. The decrease in 2014 was due to the one time increase in
2013 which was primarily attributable to the sale of RTD’s Civic Center air rights and the sale of an easement on RTD property.
Capital grants and local contributions – Capital grants and local contributions provided 18.3% and 22.0% of total revenues in 2015
and 2014. Capital grants and local contributions decreased $37,118 (18.0%) in 2015 and decreased $36,135 (14.9%) in the previous
year. The decrease in both years resulted from lower capital contributions related to completion of major construction projects: West Rail
line, U.S. 36 Manages Lanes and Denver Union Station multi-modal hub.

Packet Pg. 141

Salaries and wages–Salary and wage expense is the largest expense category accounting for 20.3% and 19.5% of the total RTD
expenses in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Salary and wage expenses increased by $7,695 (5.4%) in 2015 compared to an increase of
$7,453 (5.5%) in 2014. Increases in both years occurred from salary and wage performance (result based) and progression increases.
Benefits – Fringe benefits accounted for 10.3% and 8.4% of total expenses in 2015 and 2014. Fringe benefits increased by $14,722
(23.9%) compared to an increase of $4,932 (8.7%) in 2014. The increase in 2015 is primarily due to implementation GASB Statement
Nos. 68 and 71 establish standards for measuring and recognizing net pension liabilities. The increase in 2014 is primarily due to medical
costs; resulting from CBA employer contribution ranging from $165-$185/employee increase and salaried medical costs also increased
from prior year. Pension cost also increased in 2014 due to increased wages.
Materials and supplies – The materials and supplies expense category accounted for 7.9% and 8.5% of the total RTD expenses in 2015
and 2014 respectively. Materials and supplies expenses decreased $3,272 (5.3%) in 2015 compared to a decrease of $2,642 (4.1%) in
2014. The decrease in both years is primarily due to a decrease in diesel/gasoline fuel prices. In addition, replacement bus fleet
acquisition lowered costs of repair parts.
Services – Services expense accounted for 10.7% and 14.8% of total expenses in 2015 and 2014. Services expense includes
contracted services such as security services; vehicle, equipment and right of way maintenance services; advertising and marketing
services, and legal services. Services expense decreased $29,171 (26.8%) in 2015 compared to an increase of $3,559 (3.2%) in 2014.
The decrease in 2015 was primarily due to the contract service reduction for U.S. 36 managed lane project (Phase I).
Utilities – Utilities accounted for 1.8% and 1.9% of total expenses in 2015 and 2014. Utilities expense includes electric,
telecommunications, water and sewer, and natural gas for facilities. Utilities expense decreased $478 (3.4%) in 2015 compared to an
increase of $584 (4.3%) in 2014. The decrease in 2015 occurred due to reduction of traction power costs as a result of West Rail Line
reduced rail passenger car capacity. The increase in 2014 occurred primarily due to higher electricity rates affecting traction power costs
for light rail services.
Insurance – Insurance accounted for 1.1% and 0.7% of total expenses in 2015 and 2014. Insurance expense includes RTD’s self-insured
cost for general liability and worker’s compensation claims. In addition, RTD purchased insurance in its efforts to protect assets.
Insurance expense increased $2,829 (53.7%) in 2015 compared to a decrease of $295 (5.3%) in 2014. The increase in 2015 was due
increased frequency and severity of claims. The decrease in 2014 was due to reduction of claim activity.
Purchased transportation – The purchased transportation expense category accounted for 15.2% and 15.6% of the total expenses in
2015 and 2014. Purchased transportation represents the costs of contracted transportation services for bus, access-a-Ride, and call-nRide services. Purchased transportation costs decreased $1,726 (1.5%) in 2015 compared to an increase of $1,936 (1.7%) in 2014. The
decrease in 2015 was primarily due to reduction in service. The increase in 2014 was primarily due to negotiated contract rate increases.
Leases and rentals – Leases and rentals include lease expense for office space, office equipment, park-n-Ride facilities, and use of
communication towers. Leases and rentals expense increased $198 (6.1%) in 2015 compared to an increase of $54 (1.7%) in 2014. The
increase for both years is primarily due to RTD’s need for additional office space.
Miscellaneous – Miscellaneous expense includes other incidental operating expenses not included in other defined categories.
Miscellaneous expenses decreased $2,030 (30.9%) in 2015 compared to an increase of $113 (1.8%) in 2014. This category includes
additional one-time project expenses creating fluctuations between years.
Depreciation – The depreciation expense category accounted for 20.5% and 18.9% of the total RTD expenses in 2015 and 2014,
respectively. Depreciation expense is a non-cash systematic allocation of the cost of capital assets over the estimated useful life of the
assets. Depreciation expense increased $13,486 (9.7%) in 2015 compared to an increase of $11,789 (9.3%) in 2014. The increase in

2015 occurred primarily due the acquisition of new fleets, CAD/AVL and build-out of FasTracks. The increase in 2014 occurred primarily
from the activation of the West Line into revenue service in April.
Interest expense – The interest expense category accounted for 10.7% and 9.8% of the total RTD expenses in 2015 and 2014,
respectively. Interest expense increased $7,393 (10.2%) in 2015 compared to an increase of $11,070 (18.1%) in 2014. Interest expense
increases are due to the additional borrowings surrounding the FasTracks build-out and scheduled fleet replacements.
Other expense – Other expense includes miscellaneous non-operating expenses not classified in other expense categories. Other expense
decreased $2,183 (60.6%) in 2015 compared to a decrease of $541 (13.0%) in 2014. The decrease in both years was the result on
reduced loss of sales of assets compared to prior year.
Capital Assets – Investments in capital assets include: land and rights-of-way; buildings and improvements; leasehold improvements;
revenue and non-revenue vehicles; shop and service equipment; security and surveillance equipment; computer equipment; and furniture.
RTD’s investment in capital assets, net of accumulated depreciation, in 2015 was $6,131,608 compared to $5,413,455 in 2014. The
increase in capital assets in 2015 was $718,153 (13.3%) compared to an increase of $716,720 (15.3%) in 2014. RTD acquires its
assets with sales and use tax revenues, farebox revenue, federal capital grants, and proceeds from the sale of revenue bonds and
certificates of participation. The increases during 2015 and 2014 were primarily due to the cost of planning, design and construction of
FasTracks projects and fleet acquisition.
The following table summarizes capital assets, net of accumulated depreciation, as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 with comparative
information for 2013.

East and Gold Line Public-Private Partnership (Eagle P3) RTD was selected for inclusion in the FTA Public-Private Partnership Pilot Program (Penta-P). In 2010, RTD entered into a public-private
partnership to design, build, finance, operate and maintain several of the transit improvements contemplated under the FasTracks
program. The Eagle P3 project is a $2,185,000 project that includes a Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility, the East and Gold Line
Corridors as well as the Northwest Rail Electrified Segment. The Eagle P3 partnership was awarded to a concessionaire, Denver Transit
Partners (DTP), through a competitive bid process culminating in a contract price that was $305,000 below internal estimates. The
project is expected to begin revenue service in 2016.
The Eagle P3 project will be completed in two phases. Phase I includes the East Corridor, Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility and design
work for Phase II. Phase II includes the Gold Line Corridor and the Northwest Electrified Rail Segment. In 2015, construction
expenditures related to the Eagle P3 project were $350,156. The Eagle P3 Project elements are described below:
FasTracks East Corridor - The East Corridor is a 23.6-mile commuter rail transit corridor between Denver Union Station and Denver
International Airport. The East Corridor opened for revenue service in April 2016.
FasTracks Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility - The Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility is being designed to service the four
planned commuter rail corridors (East Corridor, Gold Line, North Metro, and Northwest Rail) included in the FasTracks plan. The
Facility opened in 2015.
FasTracks Gold Line Corridor - The Gold Line Corridor is an 11.2 mile rail transit corridor between Denver Union Station to the
vicinity of Ward Road, passing through northwest Denver, unincorporated Adams County, Arvada, and Wheat Ridge. The Gold Line is
planned to be open for revenue service in Fall 2016.
FasTracks Northwest Electrified Rail Segment – The Northwest Rail Corridor, described previously, includes a project segment,
referred to as the Northwest Electrified Rail Segment, extending from Denver Union Station to Westminster. This segment is planned
to be open for revenue service in Summer 2016, which will be completed under the Eagle P3 Project Phase II which was issued a
notice to proceed in 2011.
FasTracks I-225 Rail Line – The I-225 Rail Line is a 10.5 mile extension of RTD’s existing light rail line from the Southeast Line Nine
Mile Station to the East Line commuter rail transfer point near the intersection of Peoria Street and Smith Road. The project includes
eight stations and will serve the Aurora City Center and the Anschutz/Fitzsimons Medical Campus. This line is planned to open for
revenue service in Winter 2016. In 2015, expenditures related to the I-225 Rail Line were $156,525.
FasTracks Southeast Rail Extension – The Southeast Rail Extension extends the popular Southeast Rail Line from Lincoln Station to
the new RidgeGate Parkway Interchange at I-25. The project will add 2.3 miles of light rail. New stations will be built at Sky Ridge
Medical Center, Lone Tree City Center and RidgeGate with a 1,300 space Park-n-Ride facility. In 2015, expenditures related to the
Southeast Rail Extension were $6,715. RTD has applied for a Small Starts Grant to fund the project.
Base Revenue Earning Equipment Transit Buses - RTD entered into a multiyear fixed price contract in 2013 with an option to
purchase up to 432 40’ low floor transit buses with Gillig LLC over a 5 year period. The new bus purchases will be replacing buses that
have exceeded their useful life. The transit buses are low floor handicap accessible. In 2015, expenditures related to the 40’ transit
buses were approximately $81,108.
Additional information on RTD’s capital assets can be found in note D of this report.
Debt Administration
Outstanding debt – Outstanding debt includes sales tax revenue bonds and certificates of participation. The 2015 outstanding debt was

(18.5%) in 2014. The increase in both years 2015 and 2014 is due to new COPs issued for rail projects and well as replacement of rolling
stock.
Sales tax revenue bonds – RTD issues sales tax revenue bonds to fund the acquisition and construction of assets. The sales tax
revenue bonds were $2,013,220 and $1,955,657 as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The sales tax revenue bonds
increased $57,563 (2.9%) in 2015 compared to an increase of $60,477 (3.2%) in 2014. The increase in 2015 and 2014 is due to the
receipt of the TIFIA loan borrowings. The sales tax revenue bonds are payable from RTD’s sales and use tax revenue. RTD is required
to maintain certain minimum deposits, as defined in bond resolutions, to meet debt service requirements. The bonds may be redeemed
prior to maturity, at a price equal to the principal amount plus accrued interest thereon and a premium to the date of redemption.
Certificates of participation - Certificates of participation relate to financial obligations issued by the Asset Acquisition Authority,
Inc. (Authority), a nonprofit corporation. The Authority issued Certificates of Participation (Certificates) with the proceeds being used
to acquire certain equipment and facilities to be used by RTD. RTD leases the equipment acquired with the proceeds from the
Certificates under separate Master Lease Purchase Agreements. For financial reporting purposes, RTD accounts for the Certificates as
its own debt. Certificates outstanding were $1,230,860 and $1,064,855 as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The
Certificates outstanding increased $166,005 (15.6%) in 2015 compared to an increase of $409,625 (62.5%) in 2014. The increase in
2015 was due to the issuance of Certificates for the acquisition of equipment, buses and light rail vehicles. The increase in 2014 is due
to the issuance of Certificates for the construction of North Metro Rail Line.

Economic Factors and Subsequent Events after adoption of the 2015 Budget
RTD is dependent on sales and use taxes, which are the largest single source of revenue for RTD, representing 58.6% and 54.8% of the
total revenues in 2015 and 2014 respectively. Sales and use tax revenues are affected by the local economy in which changes will affect
the level of funding available to RTD during its fiscal year.
RTD is dependent on passenger fares collected for transit services provided. Passenger fares accounted for 13.0% and 12.8% of total
revenues in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Passenger fare collections may be affected by fare levels charged by RTD. In January 2016,
RTD implemented a fare increase and modification to fare products offered to customers.
RTD is dependent on federal and local grant funding for both operations and capital expenditures. Grants provided 26.2% and 30.0% of
total revenues in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Grant funding is only available for use by RTD for qualifying expenditures after
appropriation is made by the awarding agency.
Increases in operating expenditures are expected in 2016 due to the opening of four rail lines and bus rapid transit under the FasTracks
program. The FasTracks program is a plan to build a comprehensive, integrated region-wide transit network that will provide a reliable and
safe system, enhance mobility and respond to the growing transportation needs within the eight-county Regional Transportation District.
Additional FasTracks expansion projects are in various stages of completion with openings planned in future years.
RTD will issue revenue bonds in 2016 to provide a portion of the funding necessary to complete the Southeast Rail Line Extension as part
of the FasTracks expansion program. RTD plans to issue these bonds at a fixed interest rate and conventional terms. Outstanding bonds
and certificates of participation all have fixed interest rates and conventional terms in which debt service levels are not subject to
fluctuations in market interest rates, however, new issuances are subject to market interest rates at the time of issuance.
Requests for Information
This financial report is intended to provide an overview of RTD’s finances for those with an interest in this organization. Questions

NOTE A – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
1. Organization
The Regional Transportation District (RTD) was created as a transportation planning agency, a political subdivision of
the State of Colorado, by an Act of the Colorado General Assembly (the Act), effective July 1969 (Title 32, Article 9,
C.R.S., 1973, as amended). In 1974, the Act was amended and RTD became an operating entity charged with the
responsibility for development, operation and maintenance of a public mass transportation system for the benefit of
the citizens of the District. The District is comprised of 15 separate districts located in Denver, Boulder, Broomfield
and Jefferson counties, and certain portions of Adams, Arapahoe, Douglas, and Weld counties.
RTD is governed by a publicly elected board of directors consisting of 15 members. Each board member is elected to
serve a term of four years by the constituents of the district in which the board member resides. As required by
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), these financial statements present RTD and its component unit.
The component unit discussed in note A.2 is included in the RTD’s reporting entity because of the significance of its
operational or financial relationship with the District.
In 1988, a Senate Bill was enacted (privatization legislation) requiring RTD to implement by March 31, 1989, a plan
to competitively bid contracts for the provision of at least 20% of RTD’s bus service by private contractors. In 1999,
the Bill was amended requiring RTD to increase this provision to at least 35% of fixed route bus service. In 2003, the
Bill was amended to require that at least 50% of RTD’s vehicular service be operated by private transit companies. In
May of 2007, the legislation was amended to provide for “a system under which up to 58% of the District’s service”
is provided by private contractors.
2. Financial Reporting Entity – Blended Component Unit
The Asset Acquisition Authority, Inc. (the Authority) was formed in 1987 as a nonprofit corporation on behalf of RTD
for the purpose of issuing certificates of participation in a public offering collateralized by an installment purchase
agreement with RTD. RTD’s General Manager appoints the Board of Directors of the Authority. The Authority serves
as a financing mechanism for various financing arrangements for RTD. RTD follows pronouncement 61 issued by the
Governmental Accounting Standards Board which provides guidance regarding the inclusion of component units in the
primary government’s financial statement presentation. The activity related to the underlying financial obligations of
the Authority has been included as a blended component unit in RTD’s financial statements for the years ended
December 31, 2015 and 2014. No separately audited financial statements are prepared for the Authority.
3. Basis of Accounting
The accounts of RTD are reported as a Proprietary Fund. Proprietary funds are accounted for on the flow of economic
resources measurement focus and use the accrual basis of accounting which reports all assets, deferred outflows of
resources, liabilities, deferred inflows of resources, revenues, expenses, gains and losses. Revenue is recognized when
earned and expenses are recorded at the time liabilities are incurred. Proprietary funds distinguish operating revenues
and expenses from non-operating items. Operating revenues and expenses generally result from providing services and
producing and delivering goods in connection with a proprietary fund’s principal ongoing operations. The principal
operating revenues of RTD are charges to customers for services. Operating expenses include the cost of services,
administrative expenses and asset depreciation. All revenues and expenses not meeting this definition are reported as
non-operating revenues and expenses.
It is RTD’s policy to apply GAAP in its presentation of financial statements. When both restricted and unrestricted
resources are available for use, it is RTD’s policy to use restricted resources first, then unrestricted resources as they
are needed.

NOTE A – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
4. Cash Equivalents
RTD considers all highly liquid investments, both restricted and unrestricted, with an original maturity of three
months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
5. Interest Bearing Investments
Investments with a maturity date, when purchased, of less than one year are carried at cost or amortized cost which
approximates fair value. Investments with a maturity date of more than one year from the date of purchase are
carried at fair value.
6. Inventories
Inventories consist primarily of materials and supplies used in the ordinary course of operations. Materials and
supplies are stated at cost using the FIFO (first-in, first-out) method.
7. Other Current Assets
Certain payments to vendors reflect costs applicable to future accounting periods and are recorded as prepaid items.
Escrows are deposits held in escrow during the period of construction. At the time projects are completed, escrows
are generally applied toward the cost of the project or may be forfeited by RTD upon breach of contract.
8. Receivables
Accounts receivable are stated at the amount management expects to collect from outstanding balances.
Management provides for probable uncollected amounts through a charge to earnings and a credit to a valuation
allowance based on its assessment of the current status of individual accounts. Balances that are still outstanding
after management has used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the valuation allowance
and a credit to accounts receivable. Changes in the valuation allowance have not been material to the consolidated
financial statements.
9. Restricted Assets
Restricted assets are assets restricted by the covenants of long-term financial arrangements.
10. Capital Assets
Property and equipment are stated at historical cost. Capital assets are defined by RTD as assets with an initial,
individual cost of more than $5,000 and an estimated useful life in excess of one year. Maintenance and repairs are
charged to current period operating expenses and improvements are capitalized. Upon retirement or other disposition
of property and equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts
and any gains or losses are included in non-operating revenue and expense. A pro rata share of proceeds from the sale
of property and equipment, which were acquired with federal funds, is required to be invested in a similar asset.
Interest is capitalized on assets financed with debt or certificates of participation from the date of the borrowing
until completion of the project. The amount of tax-exempt and taxable debt and certificates of participation
(externally restricted) interest to be capitalized is the difference between the interest expense and interest earnings
on issuance proceeds. The amount of other interest to be capitalized is calculated by weighted average construction
expenditures multiplied by the weighted average interest rate of the outstanding obligations.

11. Depreciation
Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of
the assets, which are as follows:
Land improvements
Buildings
Revenue earning equipment
Shop, maintenance and other equipment

10–20 years
30 years
8–25 years
3–10 years

Fully depreciated assets, which are still in use, are included in the asset balances in the accompanying financial
statements. The cost of fully depreciated assets was approximately $370,683 and $446,561 at December 31, 2015
and 2014, respectively.
12. Deferred Outflows/Inflows of Resources
In addition to assets, the statement of financial position will sometimes report a separate section for deferred
outflow of resources. This separate financial statement element, deferred outflows of resources, represents a
consumption of net position that applies to a future period(s) and thus, will not be recognized as an outflow of
resources (expense/expenditure) until then. RTD’s deferred outflows were $77,736 and $39,736 as of December 31,
2015 and 2014, respectively.
In addition to liabilities, the statement of financial position will sometimes report a separate section for deferred
inflows of resources. This separate financial statement element, deferred inflows of resources, represents an
acquisition of net position that applies to a future period(s) and so will not be recognized as an inflow of resources
(revenue) until that time. RTD’s deferred inflows were $4,701 and $627 as of December 31, 2015 and 2014,
respectively.
13. Compensated Absences
RTD employees receive compensation for vacations, holidays, illness, and certain other qualifying absences. The
number of days compensated in the various categories of absence is based generally on length of service.
Compensated absences, which have been earned but not paid, have been accrued in the accompanying financial
statements.
14. Self-Insurance
Liabilities for property damage and personal injury are recognized as incurred on the basis of the estimated cost to
RTD. In addition, RTD offers a self-insured health benefit option as part of its employee benefits program in which
costs are recognized as they are incurred.

NOTE A – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
15. Revenue Recognition
Passenger Fares
Passenger fares are recorded as revenue at the time services are performed and revenue is collected from the
farebox. Sales of monthly passes are recorded initially as unearned revenue and recognized as income at the end of
the month for which the pass is used. Sale of ten ride and day pass tickets is recorded as income at the time of sale.
Sales of college based passes, which are valid for a specific academic semester, are recorded initially as unearned
revenue. Sales are recognized as income at the end of each month, with the amount recognized in each month
determined by prorating the total contract amount over the semesters/quarters covered. Sales of Eco Pass and
Neighborhood Pass, which are valid through December 31 of a given year, are recorded initially as unearned revenue.
Sales are recognized as income at the end of each month, with the total contract amount prorated evenly over the
number of months of the contract.
Sales and Use Taxes
Under the provisions of the Act, as amended, RTD levies a sales tax of 1.0% on net taxable sales made within the
District and a use tax of 1.0% on items purchased for use inside the District. As described in Note E, under the terms
of the Sales Tax Revenue Bonds, Series 2007A, Series 2010A, Series 2010B, Series 2012A, Series 2013 bond
resolutions, and TIFIA Sales Tax Loan, sales and use tax revenue is pledged for payment of debt service. Sales and
use taxes are collected by the State of Colorado, Department of Revenue and are remitted to a trustee who satisfies
debt service from the collections, as required under RTD’s bond and commercial paper resolutions, and remits the
balance to RTD.
Sales and use taxes are recorded as revenue by RTD in the month collected by the merchant. Sales and Use Tax
Bonds debt service will be paid from the collateralized sales and use revenues in the amount of approximately
$3,017,352 through 2050. Principal and interest paid for the current year and pledged revenues received were
$98,533.
Grants and Local Contributions
RTD receives grants from the federal government, through the Federal Transit Administration (FTA). Grants are also
awarded to RTD by state of Colorado through the Colorado Department of Transportation. The federal and state
government issues grants to RTD for operations and acquisition of property and equipment.
The amount recorded as capital grants was $157,616 and $171,549 in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Operating
assistance grant revenue was $73,383 and $75,544 in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Other contribution revenue
was $11,697 and $34,882 in 2015 and 2014, respectively.
Grants and local contributions are recorded as revenue by RTD once all applicable eligibility requirements are met.
16. Use of Estimates
The financial statements contained herein have been prepared in accordance with US Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles (GAAP). GAAP are uniform minimum standards of and guidelines to financial accounting and
reporting. GAAP establishes appropriate measurement and classification criteria for financial reporting. Adherence to
GAAP provides a reasonable degree of comparability among the financial reports of state and local governmental
units. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP involves the use of management’s estimates.
These estimates are based upon management’s best judgments, after considering past and current events and
assumptions about future events. Actual results may differ from estimates.

17. Pensions
For purposes of measuring the net pension liability, deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of resources
related to pensions, and pension expense, information about the pension plan’s fiduciary net position and additions
to/deductions from the plan’s fiduciary net position have been determined on the same basis as they are reported by
the plan. For this purpose, benefit payments (including refunds of employee contributions) are recognized when due
and payable in accordance with the benefit terms. Investments are reported at fair value.
18. GASB 68 – Classification
During the year ended December 31, 2015, RTD implemented the provisions of GASB Statement No.68 (GASB 68),
Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions, as amended by GASB Statement No. 71, Pension Transition for
Contributions Made Subsequent to the Measurement Date. GASB 68 requires governments providing defined benefit
pensions to recognize the long-term obligation for pension benefits as a liability, and to more comprehensively and
comparably measure the annual costs of pension benefits. This Statement also enhances accountability and
transparency through revised note disclosures and new required supplementary information.
19. Reinstatement of Prior Year Net Position
Net Position has been restated as required by implementation of GASB 68 as discussed in note 18 above.

NOTE B – DEPOSITS AND INVESTMENTS
Deposits
RTD’s deposits are subject to the State of Colorado’s Public Deposit Protection Act (PDPA). Under this act, all uninsured
public deposits at qualified institutions are fully collateralized with pledged collateral which is held in custody by any
Federal Reserve Bank or branch thereof, or held in escrow by some other bank in a manner as the banking Commissioner
shall prescribe by rule and regulation, or may be segregated from the other assets of the eligible public depository and held
in its own trust department. Colorado’s PDPA requires that pledged collateral to be held is clearly identified as being
security maintained or pledged for the aggregate amount of public deposits accepted and held on deposit by the eligible
public depository. The depository has the right at any time to make substitutions of eligible collateral maintained or
pledged and is at all times entitled to collect and retain all income derived from those investments without restrictions.
As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, RTD had bank deposits of $44,367 and $43,749 collateralized with
securities held by the pledging financial institutions’ trust department or agent but not in RTD’s name.

In the event that one or more nationally recognized statistical rating agency rates such Agency obligations below the highest rating category, but no
lower than one of the two highest rating categories, RTD’s funds may continue to be invested in Agencies if such investments satisfy the requirements
of CRS 24.75.601.1 (m) which limits the maturity from the date of settlement to three years, provided that the book value limits of CRS 24.75.601.1
(m) (II) shall not apply. Rather, the diversification limit shall be set as follows: no more than 75% of the portfolio may be invested in Agencies, with any
more than 25% being invested in any one Agency.

Proceeds from the issuance of RTD’s obligations are invested in accordance with legal documentation governing the
transaction, notwithstanding any provisions of RTD’s investment policy to the contrary, and do not fall within the maximum
exposure limits listed above.
At December 31, 2015 and 2014, RTD had $692,547 and $883,409 of cash and investments that were restricted under

In January 2015, RTD drew the final $75,000 and recognized $9,001 of capitalized interest from the Transportation
Infrastructure and Innovation Act (TIFIA) loan. Under the TIFIA loan authorization, RTD drew a total of $280,000 in 2013
thru 2015 and recognized $16,284 of capitalized interest. The draws from the TIFIA loan were used to pay for “Eligible
Project Costs” on RTD’s Eagle Project. The interest rate on the TIFIA loan is 3.14% with interest payments anticipated to
begin in 2021 and final maturity expected in 2045. The TIFIA loan will be used to complement the other sources of debt,
resulting in a lower cost of funding than would have otherwise been available in the capital markets. The first TIFIA draw of
$125,000 was made in 2013. The TIFIA loan is secured by a pledge of RTD’s 0.4% FasTracks sales and use tax.

ATU 1001 Pension Plan – Defined Benefit
Plan Description
The Regional Transportation District and Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1001 Pension Plan was established pursuant to
collective bargaining agreements between RTD and the Union. This plan covers substantially all full-time union-represented
employees in accordance with the union agreement. The plan is a single-employer defined benefit pension plan administered
by Compusys, Inc.
Benefits Provided
All benefits are paid in the form of a 50% joint and survivor annuity unless this form is rejected by the participant and the
spouse.
Normal retirement benefits under the Plan are paid to participants who have attained age 65 and have been with the Plan for
ten years. The benefit amount is based on final average earnings, years of employment under this Plan and age at date of
retirement.
Early retirement, effective January 1, 1992, any Participant who has accumulated 20 or more years of credited service and
terminated employment prior to attaining age 50, will be entitled to an early retirement benefit starting on the first day of
any month after he has attained age 50. The Plan was amended effective January 1, 2011. The years of credited service
needed to qualify for a normal retirement benefit was increased from five to ten years and the benefit multiplier for both the
normal and early retirement was revised.
Death benefits state if an Employee, who is not eligible for a vested benefit or not eligible to retire, should die, his beneficiary
will be paid the accumulated employee contributions plus interest. Upon the death of a pensioner, a funeral benefit of $2,000
will be paid in a lump sum to the pensioners designated beneficiary

Disability benefits, an individual who becomes totally disabled prior to age 65 and retires from active employment with RTD
as a direct result of being totally disabled is entitled to a disability retirement benefit provided he has worked for at least ten
years for RTD in covered employment or any of its predecessors. An individual will be considered totally disabled upon
receipt of a disability award from Social Security. Effective January 1, 2011 the years of credited service needed to qualify
for a disability benefit was increased from five to ten years and the benefit multiplier was revised.
Deferred Vested Retirement Benefit, an individual who terminated employment on or after January 1, 1993, for any reason
other than retirement, will be entitled to a deferred vested benefit at age 65 provided he had worked for at least ten years in
covered employment for RTD or any of its predecessors. A participant is entitled to deferred, vested benefits as early as age
50 if he has worked for at least 20 years in covered employment and terminates active employment on or after attaining age
50. If an individual with 20 or more years of service terminated employment prior to age 50, benefits will be payable at any
time after age 50. Effective January 1, 2011 the years of credited service needed to qualify for a deferred vested retirement
disability benefit was increased from five to ten years and the benefit multiplier was revised.
Benefit structure for participants hired on or after January 1, 2011. The following changes are included:
•
•
•
•
•
•

The benefit multiplier is changed from 2.5% to 1% with a new benefit schedule. (Priority 1).
Regular retirement is changed from age 55 with 20 years of service to age 60 with 20 years of service.
Sick and vacation payouts are no longer included in the pension benefit calculation. (Priority 2).
Vesting is changed from 5 years to 10 years.
Interest on employee contributions is changed from 5% to 3%.
The maximum service included in the benefit calculation is reduced from 30 years to 25 years. (Priority 3).

A “Trigger Policy” has also been provided that will partially rescind the modified benefit structure when certain Plan funding
benchmarks are achieved. If the total Actuarial Required Contribution (ARC) is less than 11% of payroll, pension benefits
would be restored in the order of priority listed above. The "Trigger" remains in effect until such time as the 11% ARC is
restored.

Single Discount Rate
Projected benefit payments are required to be discounted to their actuarial present values using a Single Discount Rate that
reflects (1) a long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments (to the extent that the plan’s fiduciary net
position is projected to be sufficient to pay benefits) and (2) tax-exempt municipal bond rate based on an index of 20-year
general obligation bonds with an average AA credit rating as of the measurement date (to the extent that the plan’s
projected fiduciary net position is not sufficient to pay benefits). For the purpose of this valuation, the expected rate of
return on pension plan investments is 7.00%; the municipal bond rate is 3.65% (based on the weekly rate closest to but not
later than the measurement date of the “state & local bonds” rate from Federal Reserve statistical release(H.15)); and the
resulting Single Discount Rate is 5.00%.

Actuarial Assumptions
The total pension liability was determined by an actuarial valuation with date of January 1, 2014, using the following
actuarial assumptions applied to all periods included in the measurement with a liability roll forward to December 31, 2014
for disclosure purposes for the Fiscal Year Ending December 31, 2015:
Inflation
Salary Increases
Investment Rate of Return

3.00%
3.75% - 8.75%
7.50%, net of investment expenses

The long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments was determined using a building-block method in
which best- estimate ranges of expected future real rates of return (expected returns, net of pension plan investment
expense and inflation) are developed for each major asset class. These ranges are combined to produce the long-term
expected rate of return by weighting the expected future real rates of return by the target asset allocation percentage
including expected inflation. Best estimates of arithmetic real rates of return for each major asset class included in the
pension plan’s target asset allocation as of the December 31, 2014 measurement date.

study covering the period January 1, 2009 - December 31, 2013.

Discount Rate
The discount rate used to measure the total pension liability was 7.50%. The projection of cash flows used to determine
the discount rate assumed that RTD contributions will be equal to the actuarially determined contribution rate for the
applicable fiscal years. Based on those assumptions, the pension plan’s fiduciary net position was projected to be
available to make all projected future benefit payments of current plan members. Therefore, the long-term expected rate
of return on pension plan investments was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine the total
pension liability.

Aurora, Colorado 80014-2602

The RTD Plan provides retirement benefits to RTD salaried employees who retire at or after age 55 with at least five years
of service. These employees are entitled to a single lump sum distribution or an annual retirement benefit, payable monthly
for life. The normal retirement benefit is equal to 2.5% of average final compensation to which a participant is entitled on
the day the participant retires, multiplied by the number of years of credited service. The RTD Board adopted amendment No.
8, effective January 1, 2008, in which salaried employee new hires shall not be eligible to participate in the RTD Plan.
The Union Plan provides retirement benefits to employees who retire at or after a certain age with at least a specified
number of years of service. These employees are entitled to a percentage of their final average earnings based on age and
credited service at retirement.

Funding Policy
Contributions to the RTD Plan are actuarially determined. RTD employees are not required to contribute to the RTD Plan.
Contributions to the Union Plan are made in accordance with the collective bargaining agreement. This agreement requires
RTD to contribute 8% and the employee to contribute 3% of the employee’s qualifying wages. Effective March 1, 2013 RTD
is to contribute 12% and the employee to contribute 4%. RTD has no liability to the Union Plan beyond its contributions.
Funding Status
Based on actuarial valuations performed as of January 1, 2014, the RTD Plan had unfunded actuarial accrued liabilities of
$19,890 and the Union Plan had unfunded actuarial accrued liabilities of $218,837. The actuarial value of assets for both
plans is determined by spreading gains and losses over a five-year period.

RTD Plan – Defined Contribution
Plan Description
The RTD defined contribution plan and represents full-time salaried employees hired after January 1, 2008. The RTD Board
adopted amendment No. 8, effective January 1, 2008. RTD contributes 9% of the employee’s qualifying wage. Contributions
totaled $2,870 and $2,394 in 2015 and 2014, respectively. RTD employees cannot contribute to the Plan. Membership was
474 and 392 active employees in 2015 and 2014, respectively. In addition, RTD has one employee in 2015 and 2014
participating in both the RTD plan and the RTD DC Plan due to a compensation level in excess of the 2015-2014
compensation limits imposed under IRC section 401(a) (17).
Amalgamated Transit Union Division 1001 Health and Welfare Trust
The Amalgamated Transit Union Division 1001 Health and Welfare Trust was formed pursuant to a Trust Agreement
effective July 1, 1971, between Amalgamated Transit Union Division 1001 (ATU 1001) and an agent of a transit enterprise
owned by the City and County of Denver, through July 3, 1974, and the Regional Transportation District (RTD) thereafter.
In addition to the original Denver Metro Division, employees of other RTD divisions have been approved for participation in
the Trust benefits. The Trust agreement shall continue in full force and effect in all its terms and provisions so long as there
continues to be a collective bargaining agreement between the Union and RTD.
The Trust provides health benefits (hospital, medical, dental, vision, life and short-term disability) for represented employees
of RTD and certain officers of ATU 1001 and health care benefits for retired employees actively working 600 hours or more
per quarter. The Trust is funded through contribution by the employer and employee, the share of benefit plan contributions
is set by the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA). RTD’s contribution was $16,846 and $13,878 for the years ended
December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Trust also provides insurance coverage for felonious assault for each
employee and funds the Amalgamated Transit Union Division 1001 Legal Services Trust. The Trust self-insures part of its
health benefits, life insurance coverage and short-term disability. The plan issues audited financial statements, which include
financial information for the plan. The financial statements may be obtained from the plan; RTD ATU 1001 Health and
Welfare Trust, 2821 S. Parker Road, Suite 215 Aurora, Colorado 80014-2602.
Unearned Compensation Plan
RTD offers its employees an unearned compensation plan (the Plan), created in accordance with Internal Revenue Code
Section 457, which is available to substantially all employees and permits them to defer a portion of their compensation to
future years. Under the terms of the Plan, the unearned compensation is available to participants upon termination,
retirement, death or in the event of an unforeseeable emergency or other financial hardship.
Compensated Absences
RTD considers all accrued compensated absences as due within one year. Employees accrue paid time off (PTO), vacation,
and sick leave based on time in service; employees are not allowed to accumulate more than twice their annual PTO or
vacation accrual and sick leave based on years of service. Employees are paid any outstanding compensated absence
balances upon leaving RTD. RTD records these accrued compensated absences as current liabilities under the principle of
conservatism by assuming these amounts are the most RTD would be obligated to pay in the near-term.

NOTE G – OPERATING LEASES – LESSOR
Union Station Alliance (USA) Lease
In December 2012, RTD entered a contract with Union Station Alliance (USA) to renovate and lease RTD’s historic Denver
Union Station Building. The renovation by USA included a hotel, Amtrak facilities, office space, retail and restaurant services
as well as renovation of the Great Train Hall. The renovations were complete and open to the public in July 2014. The
agreement includes a 60 year lease to USA to operate and maintain this facility in which RTD will participate in certain
revenue collections.

Operating Lease – Civic Center Transfer Facility
In 1976, RTD entered into an operating lease for a portion of the land on which the Civic Center transfer facility is located in
downtown Denver. As collateral for the lease, RTD must maintain an account balance with a minimum market value of $1,500 in
an escrow account, the interest on which accrues to RTD until the lease expires. This amount in escrow is included in restricted
assets in the accompanying financial statements.

Rental expense relating to this lease amounted to $257 and $254 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and

Operating Lease – Purchased Transportation
RTD has entered into a number of transactions in which certain of its light rail vehicles have been leased to and subleased
back from certain U.S. and foreign companies and has entered into a transaction in which its maintenance facilities have
been leased to and subleased back. As part of these transactions, RTD irrevocably set aside certain monies (which were
received from each counter party as payment for its leasing of light rail vehicles and real property) with a third party trustee.
The monies held by such trustees will be utilized to make the lease payments owed by the RTD under the transactions and
are therefore considered fully funded and economically defeased.
Capital Projects
As of December 31, 2015, RTD has contracts for the construction of various capital projects and the purchase of buses and
light rail vehicles. The costs to complete these projects and the purchase of buses/light rail vehicles total $461,864 and
$483,272 in 2015 and 2014, respectively.
Grant Match Requirements
Under the provisions of current grants, RTD is obligated to satisfy certain matching requirements of these grants. At
December 31, 2015, RTD had a commitment to provide $20,329 in matching funds in order to receive $66,374 in future
federal and state grant funds.

Privatization Contracts
In response to the privatization legislation (Note A), RTD has awarded contracts for specific groups of routes, not to exceed
58% as required by law for vehicular services. As of January 2016, slightly over 54.33% of RTD’s non-rail transit services
are delivered by private contractors operating under the auspices and direction of RTD.
ADA Paratransit Service
With the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), RTD was mandated to provide paratransit service to
the disabled individuals unable to use RTD’s fixed route buses, operating the same days and hours of service as the fixed
route service. This service, called Access-a-Ride, is a curb-to-curb (with door-to-door assistance upon special request)
transportation system offered to disabled individuals who cannot functionally use RTD’s regular fixed route system.
Passengers eligible for Access-a-Ride service must originate their trip within 3/4 of a mile of an RTD non-commuter fixed
route. Since September 1996, RTD has been in full compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990
requirement to provide paratransit service to the disabled individuals unable to use fixed route buses.
Future Commitments under Construction Contracts
In 2010, RTD entered into a public-private partnership to design, build, finance and operate several of the transit
improvements contemplated under the FasTracks program, including the Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility, the East
Corridor, the Gold Line Rail Corridor and the electrified segment of the Northwest Rail Corridor (together, the “Eagle P3
Project). The Eagle P3 Project is being delivered and operated under a concession agreement that RTD has entered into with
a concessionaire that has been selected through a competitive proposal process. The selected concessionaire is known as
Denver Transit Partners (DTP), a special purpose company owned by Fluor Enterprises, Uberior Investments and Laing
Investments.
The Eagle P3 Project construction will be completed in two phases with Phase I completed in 2016 and Phase II completed
in 2017. Under the terms of the Eagle P3 Project agreement, RTD will make scheduled construction payments to DTP each
year from 2011 through 2017 for completed project elements totaling $1,064,592. RTD will assume ownership of the Eagle
P3 Project elements as they are constructed. In addition, RTD will make scheduled secured principal and interest payments
to DTP from 2017 through 2044 for the remaining Eagle P3 Project obligation totaling $1,438,234 resulting in a total
project cost through 2044 of $2,502,826. The Eagle P3 Project agreement also includes a provision whereby, upon project
completion and placement in service, DTP will operate and maintain the Eagle P3 Project during the period 2016 through
2044 for which RTD will make service payments.
In 2012, RTD entered a contract with Kiewit Infrastructure Company to complete the 10.5 mile I-225 light rail line,
extending from the currently existing Nine Mile station to connect the Southeast Line to the East Line. The I-225 Line is
being completed in coordination with the Colorado Department of Transportation’s I-225 highway project and will open in
2016 to provide connectivity to major activity centers like the Aurora City Center, Anschutz/Fitzsimons Medical Center and
Denver International Airport through a transfer at Peoria to the East Rail Line.
In December 2013, RTD entered a contract with Regional Rail Partners to construct the North Metro Rail Line. The North
Metro Rail Line is an 18.5-mile electric commuter rail line that will run from Denver Union Station through Commerce City,
Thornton and Northglenn to Highway 7 at 162nd Avenue in North Adams County. The North Metro Rail Line is scheduled to
open in 2018.

NOTE H – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (CONTINUED)
Contingencies
Federal Grants
RTD receives federal grants for capital projects and operating assistance, which are subject to audit by FTA. Although the
outcome of any such audit cannot be predicted, it is management’s opinion these audits will not result in liabilities to such an
extent that they would materially affect RTD’s financial position.
Self-Insurance
RTD is self-insured for general liability and Workers’ Compensation claims. Liabilities are reported when it is probable that a
loss has occurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In addition, RTD offers a self-insured health
benefit option as part of its employee benefits program in which costs are recognized as they are incurred.
RTD does not carry excess liability insurance for personal injury and property damage. Under the provisions of the Colorado
Government Immunity Act, the maximum liability, with certain exceptions as defined in the Act, to RTD for claims involving
personal injury and property damage is $350 per individual and $990 per incident.
For Workers’ Compensation, an excess coverage insurance policy covers individual claims in excess of $2,000. The amount
of settlements has not exceeded insurance coverage in any of the past three years.
RTD’s liability for unpaid claims includes an amount for claims that have been incurred but not reported (IBNR). RTD’s Risk
Management determines incurred claims by investigating the accident and establishing a reserve. Reserves are established
on the day of assignment, reviewed at 30 days and again at 90 days. Reserves are reviewed every 90 days thereafter and
based on ultimate exposure. This amount is included in other accrued expenses in the statement of net assets. Changes in
the balances of claims liabilities for both general liability and Worker’s Compensation during the past year are as follows:

Contract Disputes and Legal Proceedings
RTD is party to a number of pending or threatened lawsuits under which it may be required to pay certain amounts upon final
disposition of these matters. RTD’s legal counsel estimates that the ultimate outcome of these matters is either sufficiently
covered by RTD’s general liability and Workers’ Compensation reserves or would not materially affect the financial
statements of RTD.
RTD has been made aware of a pending lawsuit in which the claimant is seeking a refund from the Department of Revenue
of previously paid sales taxes on purchases of aviation fuel as well as the discontinuance of such future sales tax payments.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has recently issued guidance regarding state and local taxation of aviation fuel in
which RTD may no longer be authorized to collect such taxes and possibly refund some taxes previously collected.
RTD is party to a pending lawsuit in which the plaintiffs/appellants seek to hold unconstitutional a 2013 state statute which
made several adjustments to the items upon which RTD and the Scientific and Cultural Facilities District could and could not
collect sales tax. The appellants maintained that voter approval was required. The District Court granted summary judgment
in favor of RTD and the other appellees (SCFD and the Colorado Department of Revenue). The matter is currently before the
Colorado Court of Appeals. If the District Court’s decision is reversed, RTD may no longer be authorized to collect certain
taxes and may possibly have to refund some taxes previously collected.

NOTE J – BUDGETARY DATA
RTD’s annual budget is prepared on the same basis as that used for accounting except that the budget also includes
proceeds of long-term debt and capital grants as revenue and expenditures include capital outlays and bond principal
payments, and excludes TABOR rebates under Amendment One, extraordinary loss and depreciation on, as well as gains and
losses on disposition of, property and equipment. The budget sets forth all proposed outlays for operations, planning,
administration, development, debt service, and capital outlays for the fiscal year. Prior to October 15, the General Manager
submits to the Board of Directors a proposed operating and capital budget for the fiscal year commencing the following
January 1, which is made available for public inspection and comment. On or before December 31, the budget is adopted in
conjunction with an appropriation resolution by the Board of Directors, who must also approve subsequent amendments
thereto. In the absence of such adoption, RTD has authority to begin making expenditures limited to 90% of the prior year’s
approved appropriation. RTD’s policy on budget transfers authorizes the General Manager to approve certain transfers
within the budget.
A reconciliation for the years ended December 31 of the annual budget, as amended, to actual revenue and expenses is as
follows:

Revenue, actual
Proceeds from debt / arbitrage relief
Federal capital grants and local contributions
Revenue, actual (budgetary basis)
Revenue, budget
Expenses, actual
Capital outlays
Depreciation, amortization, other
Long-term debt principal payment

Unused appropriations lapse at year-end, except the Board of Directors has the authority, as stated in the adopted
appropriation resolution, to carry over the unused portion of funds for capital projects not completed, for a period not to
exceed three years. As of December 31, 2015, there was approximately $1,004 of unused 2015 appropriations for capital
outlays available for carryover to 2016.
NOTE K – TAX, SPENDING AND DEBT LIMITATIONS
In November 1992, Colorado voters passed an amendment (Amendment One) to the State Constitution (Article X, Section
20) that limits the revenue raising and spending abilities of state and local governments known as the Taxpayer’s Bill of
Rights (TABOR). The limits on property taxes, revenue, and “fiscal year spending” include allowable annual increases tied to
inflation and local growth in construction valuation. Fiscal year spending as defined by the amendment excludes spending
from certain revenue and financing sources such as federal funds, gifts, property sales, fund transfers, damage awards, and
fund reserves (balances). The amendment requires voter approval for any increase in mill levy tax rates, new taxes, or
creation of multi-year debt. Revenue earned in excess of the “spending limit” must be refunded to the taxpayers unless
voters approve retention of these revenues. In addition, the amendment mandates that reserves equal 3% of fiscal spending
be established for declared emergencies.

Packet Pg. 190

NOTE K – TAX, SPENDING AND DEBT LIMITATIONS (CONTINUED)
On November 7, 1995, the voters of the District exempted the Regional Transportation District from the revenue and
spending limitations concerning the Amendment through December 31, 2005. On November 2, 1999, the voters of the
District further exempted RTD from the revenue and spending limitations outlined in the Amendment for the purpose of
paying any debt incurred to finance the Southeast Corridor light rail project or to operate such project for as long as any debt
remains outstanding, but in no event beyond December 31, 2026.
On November 2, 2004, the voters of the District authorized an increase in RTD’s sales and use tax rate from 0.6% to 1.0%,
effective January 1, 2005, to finance the FasTracks transit improvement program. This authorization also exempted RTD
from any revenue and spending limitations on the additional tax and on any investment income generated by the increased
tax revenue, and allowed RTD to incur debt to finance the capital improvements included in the FasTracks program. At the
time that all FasTracks debt is repaid, RTD’s sales and use tax rate will be reduced to a rate sufficient to operate the rapid
transit system financed through FasTracks. RTD has $3.477 billion in authorized debt, subject to the Amendments’
limitations. This debt was authorized by the voters of the District in 2004 to pay for the FasTracks rapid transit
improvement program. Based on estimated fiscal year spending for 2015, $20,284 of year-end net position, as restated,
has been reserved for emergencies.
The Amendment is complex and subject to judicial interpretation. RTD believes it is in compliance with the requirements of
the Amendment based on the interpretations of the Amendment’s language available at year-end.
NOTE L – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
On January 1, 2016, RTD implemented a fare structure modification. The modification was the culmination of a two year
task force fare study with the goals of simplification, equity and the achievement of revenue levels set out in the Strategic
Budget Plan.
On January 1, 2016, the RTD Board of Directors contracted with the RTD Interim General Manager and CEO for three years
plus two option years to serve as the permanent RTD General Manager and CEO.
On January 3, 2016, RTD began Bus Rapid Transit service along U.S. 36 between downtown Denver and Boulder as part of
the FasTracks Project.
On April 22, 2016, RTD began Commuter Rail service on the East Line between downtown Denver and Denver International
Airport as part of the FasTracks Project.

Auditor Communications
Regional Transportation District

We have audited the basic financial statements of RTD for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our audit was
performed in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards
applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the
United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement and presented in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit
evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. We also assessed the accounting principles
used by RTD and the reasonableness of significant estimates made by RTD’s management, as well as evaluated the
overall financial statement presentation.
Auditing standards require the auditor to ensure that those charged with governance receive additional information
regarding the scope and results of the audit that may assist the governing body in overseeing the financial reporting
and disclosure process for which management is responsible. The following section describes matters which are
required to be reported to you.

Our Responsibility Under U.S. Generally Accepted
Auditing Standards, Government Auditing Standards
And The Uniform Guidance

Reports issued by RubinBrown:
Unmodified report on RTD’s financial statements based
upon an audit of the financial statements in accordance
with auditing standards generally accepted in the United
States of America and Governmental Auditing Standards
RTD agreed-upon procedures reports regarding National
Transit Database reporting
Consulting engagement to determine the cost of the RTD
GM contract
A report on RTD’s internal control over financial reporting
and compliance and other matters based upon an audit of
the financial statements in accordance with Governmental
Auditing Standards
A unmodified report on RTD’s compliance for each major
program and a report on internal control over compliance
and report on the schedule of expenditures of federal
awards in accordance with the Uniform Guidance

Our responsibility, as described by professional standards, is to
express an opinion about whether the financial statements
prepared by management with your assistance are fairly
presented, in all material respects, in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and whether
RTD complied in all material respects with the applicable
compliance requirements of its major federal programs. Our
audit of the financial statements and compliance does not
relieve you or management of responsibility for the accuracy of
the financial statements and/or compliance with applicable
requirements.
Professional standards also require that we obtain a significant
understanding of RTD’s internal control to plan the audit.
However, such understanding is required for the purpose of
determining our audit procedures and not to provide any
assurance concerning such internal control. Accordingly, we
express no such assurance.

Planned Scope And Timing Of The Audit

We performed the audit according to the planned scope and
timing communicated in our letter dated March 8, 2016
regarding the timing and extent of our audit procedures.

Qualitative Aspects Of Accounting Practices
Management is responsible for the selection and use of
appropriate accounting policies. In accordance with the terms
of our engagement letter, we will advise management about the
appropriateness of accounting policies and their application.

Significant accounting policies are described in Note A.
No new accounting policies were adopted, and the
application of existing policies was not changed, except
for the following:
Governmental Accounting Standards Board
(GASB) 68: Accounting and Financial Reporting for
Pensions and GASB 71: Pension Transition for
Contributions Made Subsequent to the
Measurement Date - an amendment of GASB
Statement No. 68 (GASB 68)
We noted no transactions entered into during the year for
which there was a lack of authoritative guidance or
consensus.
No significant transactions have been recognized in a
different period than when the transactions occurred.

Management Judgments And Accounting
Estimates
The preparation of the financial statements requires
the use of accounting estimates. Certain estimates
are particularly sensitive due to their significance to
the financial statements and the possibility that future
events may differ significantly from management’s
expectations.

Financial Statement Disclosures

We evaluated the key factors and assumptions used to develop the
estimates in determining that they are reasonable in relation to the
financial statements taken as a whole. The most sensitive estimates
affecting the financial statements are:
Management’s estimate of depreciation is based upon estimated
useful lives of capital assets.
Management’s estimate of the allowance for bad debts is based on
management’s review of outstanding receivables.
Management’s estimate of the net pension liability is based on
actuarial valuations and employee census data.
The disclosures are neutral, consistent and clear. Certain disclosures are
particularly sensitive because of their significance to financial statement
users. The most sensitive disclosures affecting the financial statements
are:
The disclosure of capital assets in Note D
The disclosure of long-term debt in Note E
The disclosure of employee retirement and unearned compensation
plans in Note F
The disclosure of commitments and contingencies in Note H
The disclosure of the tax, spending and debt limitations in Note K

OMB Circular A-133 Compliance: Transportation Infrastructure Finance

Status
Implemented

The TIFIA loan agreement specified a funding period (period of availability), which
is the period of time when eligible project costs can be incurred for potential
reimbursement under the program. The TIFIA loan agreement specified eligible
federal project costs were for work performed after November 6, 2009. RTD
submitted reimbursement requests that included expenditures outside of the period
of availability and, as a result, incurred questioned costs of approximately
$1.5 million. RTD has identified other eligible project costs that meet the period of
availability and is in the process of amending the related reimbursement requests.
The TIFIA program is a federally funded loan, which is not a typical federal funding
arrangement that RTD has encountered previously; therefore, the loan program
reimbursements were not subjected to the same internal controls as federally
funded reimbursement grants. We recommended that the RTD Grant Accountant
prepare all reimbursement requests for all federal funds including both grant and
federal loan programs.

Recode Of Transactions (Recurring):

MANAGEMENT RESPONSE
Partially implemented

RTD regularly recodes transactions to allocate expenditures:
From a general project to a specific task within the project
From one federal source to another
From one project to another
From local sources to federal sources
The recodes occur for various reasons not limited to correcting errors, utilizing
different funding sources or refining/finalizing the accounting for a project. The
recode entries are created by the budget analyst and reapproved by the individuals
who approved the original transactions. The Accounting Manager then reviews and
approves posting of the entry. While the Accounting Manager will consult with the
FasTracks Program Control Manager or the Chief Financial Officer, depending on
the nature and sensitivity of the recode, there is no other formal documentation
regarding approval of the recode. We recommended that management continue to
enhance the policy whereby recodes that meet certain quantitative or qualitative
characteristics, such as a change in funding source or project, be approved by the
Program Control Manager or other appropriate designated individual.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

From:

Date:

May 18, 2016

Subject:

Salaried Employee Trustee Replacement

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: May 18, 2016
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: May 31, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the attached Resolution No. ______ amending the Salaried Employee Defined Benefit (i.e.,
Pension) Plan and Salaried Employee Defined Contribution Plan to provide for appointment of the same
four employee trustees for each of the plans, with two trustees being employee participants in the
Pension Plan, and two being employee participants in the Defined Contribution Plan. The resolution
further provides that the three existing employee trustees serving both plans remain as trustees with
revised termination dates to assure continued staggered terms, and that a fourth employee be appointed
to replace retired trustee Marla Lien.
BACKGROUND
RTD has a Salaried Employee Pension Plan which has been closed to new participants after 2007, and a
Salaried Employee Defined Contribution Plan covering employees hired since then. The above Plans have
the same set of seven trustees serving both plans: two Director Trustees, RTD’s Chief Financial Officer
as a permanent trustee, and four employees. For the four employees, since 2008 the Plans have
specified that two trustees are to be “senior managers” (defined as AGM level employees) and two are
to be “middle managers.” This structure was intended to prevent Trustees from being drawn exclusively
from higher-level employees, and to give lower-level employees more opportunity for representation.
The “senior manager”-“middle manager” distinction was put in place by RTD Board resolution when RTD
converted to a Defined Contribution (DC) plan for all new employees starting in 2008.
Due to their seniority with RTD, many “senior managers” as well as “middle managers” are participants
in the Pension Plan rather than the DC plan. The current rule also prevents more junior employees, or
senior employees who do not happen to be “managers” (for example, professionals) from being able to
seek representation on the Trust.
To ensure that both plans have representation on the combined Trusts, and consistent with the 2008
goal to have more than highest-level employees on the Trusts, it is recommended that the Board revise
the selection process to specify that going forward, two employee trustees serving both trusts will be
Pension Plan participants and two will be DC Plan participants. (At some point all Pension Plan
beneficiaries may no longer be current employees due to retirement, but that point will not be reached
for several decades.)
The resolution also restores staggered trustee terms, re-appoints existing trustees to new terms, and
adds a new trustee who is a member of the Defined Contribution plan.
The attorney for the trusts, Stephen Weinstein of Berenbaum Weinshienk PC, has reviewed the proposal
and has approved the resolution as to legal form for the Trusts. Mr. Weinstein concurs that the Board is
empowered to approve this amendment; no vote by the Trustees is required or contemplated, although

Packet Pg. 243

11.E

the proposed resolution and this recommended action has been shared with the trustees for review and
comment.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action and approve the attached resolution amending the Trust plan.
This is recommended to restore staggered terms, replace the retired trustee, and assure continued
representation going forward.
2. Reject the Recommended Action and the attached resolution, and require staff to return with a
revised recommendation. This is not recommended since the attached Recommended Action has
been reviewed by the Trusts’ attorney and current trustees, and is consistent with the goals of
existing Board resolutions.

APPOINTMENT OF TRUSTEES TO THE RTD SALARIED EMPLOYEES’ PENSION TRUST
AND RTD SALARIED EMPLOYEES’ DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN TRUST

Whereas, RTD maintains the RTD Salaried Employees' Pension Plan and Trust ("Pension Plan"
or "Pension Trust") for salaried employees hired by RTD before January 1, 2008 and the RTD Salaried
Employees' Defined Contribution Plan and Trust ("Defined Contribution Plan" or "Defined Contribution
Trust") for salaried employees hired on or after January 1, 2008, which may collectively be referred to
as the "Trusts"; and,
Whereas, two RTD Board Directors and five salaried employees serve as the same sets of
trustees for each of the above Trusts as further described below; and,
Whereas, on January 8, 2008 the RTD Board of Directors adopted Resolution No. 1 Series of
2008 providing that a screening committee composed of the Board Chair, the Chair of the Salaried
Employee Pension Trust Fund and the Finance Chair (i.e., Chair of the Finance Administration and
Audit Committee) will screen applications from the middle management salaried employee class and the
senior management salaried employee class and will bring recommendations back to the Board; and,
Whereas, on December 16, 2008 the RTD Board of Directors adopted Resolution No. 19 Series
of 2008 amending Section 7.01 of the Pension Trust and Section 7.01 of the Defined Contribution Trust
regarding appointment of Trustees, to provide that each Trustee who is a member of the Board of
Directors of RTD shall serve a term concurrent with his or her elected term, and one senior management
and one middle management Trustee shall each serve a three year term, and one senior management and
one middle Trustee shall each serve a two year term; and
Whereas, on November 10, 2010 the RTD Board of Directors adopted Resolution No. 27 Series
of 2010, making additional modifications to state that for reappointment of Trustees who have served
satisfactorily and in whose education the Trusts have made substantial investments, it is not necessary to
seek applications for renewal, and instead the application process established by the RTD Board of
Directors in 2008 will be used on those occasions when the Board finds it necessary or appropriate to
appoint new salaried trustees to the Trusts; and
Whereas, the Defined Contribution Trust has now been in existence since 2008, and there are
now both senior and middle management RTD employees, as well as other RTD employees who are not
managers, participating in the Pension Trust or the Defined Contribution Trust and who may be well
qualified for consideration for appointment as trustees; and
Whereas, the RTD Board of Directors wishes to amend the Pension Trust and the Defined
Contribution Trust, to end the “senior” and “middle” management distinction, and instead authorize the
Board of Directors to appoint two employee Trustees who participate in the Pension Plan and two who
participate in the Defined Contribution Plan, in addition to the two Board members who are appointed to

11.E.a

Whereas, the RTD Board of Directors wishes to ensure that the four appointed employees on the
Trusts serve staggered terms as contemplated in Resolution No. 19 Series of 2008; and
Whereas, senior management Trustee Marla Lien has retired from RTD, and the terms for senior
management Trustee Scott Reed, middle management Trustee Sylvia Francis, and middle management
Trustee Luong (Lou) Ha will all expire on 12/31/2017; and
Whereas, Scott Reed, and Luong (Lou) Ha are Pension Plan participants, and Sylvia Francis is a
Defined Contribution Plan participant, requiring the RTD Board of Directors to appoint an additional
participant in the Defined Contribution Plan as a trustee, and adjust the terms of service of the remaining
employee Trustees, to accomplish the above goals; and
Whereas, consistent with the direction in the above 2008 and 2010 Resolutions, the Board
Chair, the Chair of the Salaried Employee Pension Trust and the Finance Administration and Audit
Committee Chair have considered employees to serve as trustees in accordance with this Resolution, and
recommend that the Pension Plan and Defined Contribution Plan participating employees listed below in
this Resolution be appointed as Trustees by the Board for the terms set forth below; and
Whereas, after approval of this Resolution the trustee vacancy will be filled from a Defined
Contribution Plan participating employee consistent with this Resolution and the amended Trust
Agreements.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT:
1. The RTD Board of Directors thanks retired Trustee Marla Lien for her long, dedicated and
exemplary service to the Trusts.
2. The RTD Board of Directors hereby repeals and restates Section 7.01 of each of the Trusts to
read as follows, effective immediately:
7.01. Appointment and Term of Trustees. Seven (7) persons in number shall be appointed by
the Chairperson of the Board of Directors of RTD, provided, however, such appointment shall
not become effective until there is approval thereof by resolution adopted by the Board of
Directors of RTD. Two (2) of such appointees shall be members of the Board of Directors of
RTD, one (1) shall be the RTD Chief Financial officer, and four (4) shall be salaried employees
of RTD. Of the four salaried employees, two members shall be participants in the Salaried
Employees’ Defined Benefit Plan and two shall be participants in the Salaried Employees’
Defined Contribution Plan. The four (4) salaried employees shall each serve a two (2) year term
commencing January 1 and ending December 31 (or until they are re-appointed or their
successor is appointed, if later), except that the Board of Directors of RTD may by resolution
establish different terms for newly-appointed employee Trustees as may be necessary to maintain
the staggered terms of the categories of employee Trustees. Each Trustee who is a member of the

with the Chief Financial Officer, will be established to review applications for employee trustees
going forward, including applications for the second Trustee who is a defined Contribution Plan

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

From:

Terry Emmons, Assistant General Manager,
Rail Operations

GM

Date:

May 19, 2016

Board Meeting Date: May 31, 2016

Subject:

Authorization to Enter into a Contract with
Motorola Solutions for Purchase of Radios
(56DH012)

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to enter into a $940,000 sole source contract with
Motorola Solutions(Motorola) for purchase of mobile, portable and tower radios and associated
equipment (Contract Number 56DH012). This contract will include an option for a 3-year extended
warranty.
BACKGROUND:
RTD uses a Motorola P25 digital trunked radio system for 2-way voice communications throughout the
district by many operational business units. This system was purchased as part of the Radio and
Computer Aided Dispatch/Automatic Vehicle Location (CAD/AVL) Replacement Project in 2010.
RTD is opening several rail lines in 2016, including additional light rail service for the new R Line. As
such, there will be additional Light Rail Vehicles (LRVs) and increased need for security and fare
enforcement officers. These LRVs and officers need radios to perform effectively. These radios are not
essential for the April 22nd launch of the University of Colorado A Line, but should be procured before
any other lines are opened.
Additionally, RTD’s Gunbarrel radio tower requires additional capacity. New repeaters are included in
this purchase to provide additional capacity. The radio combiner in this purchase is to replace a broken
combiner.
DISCUSSION:
As part of participation in the Public Safety radio network, all tower equipment is required to be
Motorola equipment to maintain system consistency of operations throughout the network. Additionally,
RTD currently has close to 3000 Motorola mobile and portable radios that were selected as part of a
competitive bid process. There would be additional costs for system keys, programming cables,
programming software and training associated with procurement of other radio brands. Therefore,
subscriber radios will have a higher operating cost than the recommended Motorola Radios. Additionally,
the network equipment on the public safety radio system RTD uses is manufactured by Motorola. It is
required that the network equipment remain Motorola for effective management of the network and as a
requirement of the Consolidated Communications Network of Colorado (CCNC), the managing
organization for the radio network.
RTD, as a political subdivision of the State of Colorado may buy equipment off of the existing,
competitively-procured Western States Contract Alliance (WSCA) Public Safety Communication
Equipment contract. A sole source justification memo to use the competitively-procured WSCA contract
has been approved.

Packet Pg. 253

11.F

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The cost of the subscriber radios is funded in the 2015 capital budget. The tower radios are funded
from the Radio-CAD/AVL budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to enter into a $940,000 sole source
contract with Motorola Solutions (Motorola) for purchase of mobile, portable and tower radios
and associated equipment (Contract Number 56DH012). This contract will include an option
for a 3-year extended warranty.
2. Do not authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute a contract with Motorola
Solutions to purchase needed radio equipment. This action would result in RTD’s inability to
effectively supply security officers with needed radios, provide additional needed capacity for
tower sites, repair a tower site with faulty equipment and provide some of the radios
necessary for the opening of the R line. This is not the recommended action.

Board Meeting Date: May 31, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors adopt
the 2016 Title VI Program Update to comply with federal laws, regulations and guidelines related to Title
VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
BACKGROUND
Pursuant to Section 12 of the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) Master Agreement, RTD must comply
with 49 CFR part 21 and FTA Circular 4702.1B, which effectuates Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of
1964 (Title VI), as a condition of federal financial assistance. Title VI prohibits discrimination on the
basis of race, color and national origin from recipients of federal financial assistance (grants, loans, etc.).
DISCUSSION
Per FTA Circular 4702.1B, Title VI Requirements and Guidelines for Federal Transit Administration
Recipients, RTD is required to submit a Title VI Program Update every three years. The Title VI Program
Update details the manner in which RTD intends to achieve compliance with the following objectives of
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964:
1. To ensure that FTA-assisted benefits and related services are made available and are equitably
distributed without regard to race, color, or national origin;
2. To ensure that the level and quality of FTA-assisted transit services are sufficient to provide equal
access and mobility for any person without regard to race, color or national origin;
3. To ensure that opportunities to participate in the transit planning and decision-making are
provided to persons without regard to race, color or national origin;
4. To ensure that decisions on the location of transit services and facilities are made without regard
to race, color or national origin; and
5. To ensure that corrective and remedial action is taken to prevent disparate impacts borne by any
beneficiary based on race, color, or national origin.
The update itself includes an Executive Summary and is an attachment to the board report. The
appendices of this document contain a high volume of pages (over 300), thus the appendices will be
made available separately in the Board Office for review.

Title VI Program Update
MAY 2016

Title VI and Environmental Justice
Equity is a core principle of the Regional Transportation District’s (RTD) mission to provide mass transit service
in the Denver Metro Area. An equitable mass transit system fairly distributes the benefits and adverse effects
of transit service without regard for race, color, national origin, or low-income status. This principle is detailed
and reinforced by Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of
1964 and Executive Order 12898 pertaining to
environmental justice.
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits
discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national
origin in programs receiving federal financial
assistance. Specifically, Title VI states, “No person in
the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or
national origin, be excluded from participation in, be
denied the benefits of, or be subjected to
discrimination under any program or activity receiving
Federal financial assistance.”
In 1994, President Clinton issued Executive Order
12898, which states that each federal agency “shall
make achieving environmental justice part of its mission
by identifying and addressing disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects of
its programs, policies, and activities on minority populations and low-income populations.”
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial assistance
with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI and Environmental Justice. In this circular, the FTA
requires that RTD document measures taken to comply with DOT’s Title VI regulations by submitting a Title VI
Program to their FTA regional civil rights officer once every three years or as otherwise directed by FTA.
In this Title VI program update, the Transit Oriented Communities Division has compiled a documentation of
compliance efforts made from June of 2013 – June of 2016. Below is an overview of the collection of
documents and information that comprise the 2016 Title VI Program Update.

District. Customer Satisfaction Survey data shows Denver Local and Limited Bus service is primarily utilized by
minority and low-income populations.
For detailed information pertaining to the District’s minority and low-income populations please observe the
Demographic Profile Maps and Customer Satisfaction Survey data included as appendices to this document.

Complaints
Federal recipients are also required to directly accept, log and investigate complaints of discrimination.
Further, recipients are required to notify the public of their right to complain and the procedures for
processing their complaint. In the appendix is a copy of the Title VI public notice placed on all RTD vehicles,
and a table summarizing complaints received and their status (open, closed, etc…).

Attachment: 2016 Title VI Program Update - Executive Summary (2806 : 2016 Title VI Program Update)

RTD’s 2,340 square mile service area (primarily consisting of the Denver Metro area) is inhabited by 2.7
million people, living in diverse communities, with geographically dispersed high-concentrations of minorities
(above 29% representation in a Census tract/block group) and low-income populations (above 21%
representation in a Census tract/block group).

Subrecipient

The RTD Title VI Manager will ensure the following actions are taken affirming that RTD and its sub-recipients
comply with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and FTA Circular 4702.1B:
1. Each year sub-recipients must provide RTD with an FTA Civil Rights Assurance/Signed Assurance that
all records and other information required under FTA Circular 4702.1B have been or will be
compiled, as appropriate, and maintained;
2. Each sub-recipient must implement a Title VI complaint process and provide RTD with a list of active
lawsuits and Civil Rights Complaint summary alleging discrimination on the basis of race, color or
national origin;
3. Each sub-recipient must post its Title VI Policy Statement in prominent, conspicuous and accessible
locations throughout its facilities;
4. Sub-recipients must take responsible steps to ensure meaningful access to the benefits, services,
information, and other important portions of their programs and activities for individuals who are
Limited English Proficient (LEP).
In general, sub-recipients should have a public participation process that offers early and continuous
opportunities for the public to be involved in the identification of social, economic, and environmental impacts
of proposed transportation decisions. Efforts to involve minority and low-income people in public involvement
activities can include both comprehensive measures, such as placing public notices at all stations and in all
vehicles, and measures targeted to overcome linguistic, institutional, cultural, economic, historical, or other
barriers that may prevent minority and low-income populations from effectively participating in a recipient’s
decision-making. Sub-recipients must file with RTD documentation of its public participation plan.
Each sub-recipient further agrees to comply
with, and assure compliance by its third party
subcontractors at any tier under the Project, with
all requirements of the FTA Title VI Program
pursuant to FTA Circular 4702.1B and 49 CFR
21.5(b)(2) and 49 CFR 21 .5(b)(7), Appendix C

process.

11.G.b
Title VI Program Update

FTA Circular 4702.1b Chapter VI requires fixed-route service providers of Urbanized Areas with a
population of 200,000 or more to establish service standards and monitor their service to ensure service is
provided accordingly. Service standards guide fixed-route service providers toward objective decisionmaking in the provision of service. The FTA further expects transit agencies to monitor their services to ensure
service is provided in a non-discriminatory manner. Service is monitored by comparing a sampling of nonminority routes and minority routes, defined as 1/3 of revenue mileage borders census blocks with a minority
population greater than the service area average. No disparities were found during the transit monitoring of
this reporting period. The RTD service standards and transit monitoring results can be found in the appendix.

Fare and Service Change Equity Analyse s
The FTA requires RTD to establish policies that will guide the analysis to determine whether major service
changes will have a disproportionately negative impact on minority or low-income populations. Accordingly,
RTD established equity analysis policies and a service evaluation process to meet this requirement.

Equity Analysis Policies
Per FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Major Service Change Policy, a Disparate
Impact Policy, and a Disproportionate Burden Policy. Collectively, these policies provide foundational
requirements for evaluating service change proposals for equity. These policies and their applicable
thresholds are listed below:
1. Major Service Change Policy: A major service change is defined as a 25 percent addition or
reduction in the service hours of any route that would remain in effect for twelve (12) or more months.
All major service changes will be subject to an equity analysis that includes an analysis of adverse
effects.
a. Adverse Effect is defined as a geographical or temporal reduction in service that includes, but
is not limited to: eliminating a route, shortening a route by eliminating segments, rerouting an
existing route, and increasing headways. RTD shall consider the degree of adverse effects
and analyze those effects when planning major service changes.
2. Disparate Impact Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a minority population
10 percent more than non-minority populations; this level of impact is considered a disparate impact.
3. Disproportionate Burden Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a low-income
population 10 percent more than non-low-income
populations; this level of impact is considered a
disproportionate burden. A low-income population
is a group of households who are at or below 150
percent of the Department of Health and Human
Services Poverty Guidelines.
If a proposed major service change results in a
disparate impact or a disproportionate burden,
RTD will consider modifying the proposed service
change. RTD will then analyze the modification and
make sure it removed the potential disparate
impact or disproportionate burden. If a less
discriminatory option cannot be identified and RTD
can demonstrate a substantial legitimate
justification for the proposed service change, the

FTA may allow RTD to proceed with the proposed change.
The board approved policies can be found in the appendix.

This program update includes the results of both fare and service change equity analyses completed between
February 2013 and April 2016. Included with the results of each equity analysis are the proposed changes
and Board of Directors Meeting Minutes associated with the proposed change. Below is a list of each

CONCLUSION
During this reporting period, RTD performed extensive public engagement, completed several equity analyses
for major fare and service changes and found no probable cause in any official Title VI complaints. The
comprehensive analysis and monitoring efforts described in this document succeeded in promoting the
equitable provision of transit service in the Denver Metro Area. This snapshot summarizes RTD’s effort to not
only comply with the requirements of FTA Circular 4702.1B, but to advance social equity through policy and
public engagement.

Subject:

State Legislative Liaison Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Government Relations Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the
General Manager, or his designee, to enter into an agreement for state legislative liaison services with
Brandeberry~McKenna Public Affairs (BBMK) to exercise a one-year option (June 30, 2016 through
June 29, 2017) to extend Contract No. 13-DX-00, at a cost of $122,000, pursuant to the Contract
Award agreement.
BACKGROUND
Contract 13-DX-001 for State Legislative Liaison Services was signed with Brandeberry~McKenna
Public Affairs, effective July 1, 2013, and contained a provision for four (4) additional one-year option
periods. This board action would exercise the option for Year 3 of the option years. Of extreme
importance, the lobbyists are in daily contact with state legislators regarding bills that RTD seeks to have
passed, as well as regarding bills that would be harmful to RTD.
DISCUSSION
The state lobbying team provides guidance and direction for the RTD Board of Directors and staff in
their relationships with the General Assembly members. Constant monitoring of the activities within
the General Assembly and the Executive Office of the state of Colorado is required, and RTD’s
interests must be conveyed to appropriate legislators, including testifying before certain committees.
Advice and assistance in drafting legislation are also provided by the lobbying team. When RTD has
had legislation before the General Assembly, Brandeberry~McKenna has an excellent record of
making certain that these bills pass and become part of the Colorado statutes.
As part of the services, frequent contact is made with RTD staff and board members regarding various
bills in the legislature; written summary reports are issued on a weekly basis during the legislative
session; and status reports are given at the Government Relations Committee meetings while the
General Assembly is in session and as deemed necessary thereafter.
The Brandeberry~McKenna team also takes the initiative to educate state legislators on RTD issues and
projects so that these legislators understand mass transit and RTD’s mission.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Approve the Recommended Action. It is recommended by RTD’s Government Relations Committee
that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to enter into an agreement for state
legislative liaison services with Brandeberry~McKenna Public Affairs (BBMK) to exercise a one-year
option (June 30, 2016 through June 29, 2017) to extend Contract No. 13-DX-001, at a cost of
$122,000, pursuant to the Contract Award agreement.
2. Do not approve the Recommended Action.
Do not accept the recommendation by the
Government Relations Committee that authorizes the General Manager to enter into a contract to
execute the state legislative liaison services one-year option agreement. A new Request for

Packet Pg. 287

12.H

Proposals could be sent to interested parties, interviews conducted, and a different state lobbying
firm could possibly be selected by the Government Relations Committee and retained. This action
is not recommended because it is the consensus of the Government Relations Committee to
recommend to the Board the selection of the Brandeberry~McKenna team.
3. Do not approve the Recommended Action. Do not retain the services of a state legislative liaison
firm. This action is not recommended because it would put RTD in the position of facing
contentious and potentially harmful legislative issues with no direct legislative liaison services. It
was determined by the Government Relations Committee that the Brandeberry~McKenna team
has been very effective in pursuing the RTD state legislative agenda and will continue to
represent RTD’s interests very well in the future. This team is very familiar with RTD’s issues
and policies.

The resolution also allows for the potential refinancing of the Series 2010A and Series 2012A
FasTracks bonds if economically beneficial to RTD and generates more than a 3% present value
savings at the time of the issuance of the Series 2016A bonds.
The Chief Financial Officer has taken preliminary actions to arrange for the issuance and sale of the
bonds, including assembling financial information related to the District and drafting a preliminary
official statement, bond indenture, continuing disclosure agreement, bond purchase agreement and
the Resolution for issuance of the Bonds. The Board is being requested, through the Resolution, to
authorize the issuance, to establish the terms and to approve agreements required in connection with
the issuance of the Bonds.

approve parameters subject to the restrictions and parameters outlined in the Section 4 of the
Resolution; namely that the principal amount of the Bonds shall not exceed $200,000,000; the final
maturity on the Bonds shall not extend beyond December 1, 2046; the maximum net effective
interest rate on the Bonds shall not exceed 7.00% and the combined purchase price of the Bonds
shall not be less than 98%.
Drafts of documents referenced in the Bond Resolution including the Bond Indenture, the Continuing
Disclosure Agreement, the Preliminary Official Statement and the Bond Purchase Agreement are

include underwriter, financial advisory, attorney and, printing fees.

Board Meeting Date: May 31, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Resolution”), expressing the intent of the Board to
be reimbursed from a future financing for certain expenses relating to the acquisition of buses.
BACKGROUND:
The SBP adopted by the board in 2015 anticipates the acquisition and financing of buses, including
MCI buses, 40 foot transit buses, 60 foot articulated buses, 30 foot transit buses and smaller cut
away vehicles used for Call n Ride and ADA services.
DISCUSSION:
Some of the vehicles identified in the SBP will begin arriving in May 2016 and RTD will begin paying
for the vehicles shortly after delivery and acceptance. In order for these bus acquisition expenses to
be eligible for reimbursement from a future financing, a reimbursement resolution such as the one
being recommended must be adopted by the Board.
In the coming months, the Chief Financial Officer will take preliminary actions to arrange for the
financing, including assembling financial information related to the District and drafting preliminary
documents and a Resolution for the financing. Drafts of these documents and the Resolution for the
financing will be brought to the Board for consideration at a future time.
The Board is being requested, through this Resolution, to express the intent of the Board to be
reimbursed for certain expenses relating to the acquisition of busses through a future financing.
RTD is receiving the advice of Butler Snow LLP as Bond Counsel in regard to this reimbursement
resolution.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
Principal and interest costs related to this future financing are included in the budget and the SBP
adopted by the Board in 2015.
ALTERNATIVES:
1.
Authorize the attached Resolution No. __, Series of 2016, expressing the intent of the
Board to be reimbursed for certain expenses relating to the financing of buses. This is the
recommended action.
2.

Do not authorize the execution of documents, including the attached Resolution No. __, Series
of 2016, expressing the intent of the Board to be reimbursed for certain expenses relating to

the financing of buses. This is not the recommended action as it would adversely affect
RTD’s ability to proceed with bus acquisition projects.

financing of such Project; and
WHEREAS, it is the Board’s reasonable expectation that when such financing
occurs, the capital expenditures will be reimbursed with the proceeds of the financing; and
WHEREAS, in order to comply with the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended, it is the Board’s desire that this resolution shall constitute the “official

or desirable in connection therewith.
Section 3.
The officers, employees and agents of the District shall take all
action necessary or reasonably required to carry out, give effect to and consummate the

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

From:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

May 18, 2016

Board Meeting Date: May 31, 2016

Subject:

August 2016 Service Change Final

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the August 2016 Service Change package as revised and summarized in Attachment A resulting
in an annualized cost of approximately $537,935 and, further, to authorize the General Manager or his
designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is impacted
by these changes.
DISCUSSION
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. We will continue adjusting services in
response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. It is also
our responsibility to identify services that are underperforming and recommend modifications,
curtailment or cancellation of service as warranted. The proposals herein include a mix of service
enhancements, routine schedule adjustments and several service reductions. Also included in this report
is a grant funded proposal anticipated to be implemented in the August service change. Funded through
a CMAQ grant, enhancements to the frequency of the Free Metro Ride operating between DUS and Civic
Center Station are proposed. We will monitor customer response to the implementation of these service
changes and propose adjustments and service alternatives as appropriate in future service change
recommendations.
The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
 Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
 Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
SUMMARY OF PUBLIC HEARINGS
Two hearings were held in Denver at the Blake Administration building and one meeting was held in
Longmont and one meeting in Commerce City. Comments and further details from these meetings and
the service change website are summarized in Attachment B of this report.
CHANGES TO INITIAL RECOMMENDATIONS
Staff receives input during the public comment process and continues to conduct additional analysis
after the initial service recommendations are communicated to the Board of Directors. Depending on the
outcome of the public comment process and continued analysis, staff may or may not propose
modifications to these initial recommendations. The following represent substantive changes proposed to

Packet Pg. 323

12.K

the service changes initially communicated to the Board of Directors for implementation as part of the
August 2016 service change:
Route 62: this proposal has been postponed until the completion of roadway work around the
Commerce City municipal center
Free Metro Ride: additional trips expanding the higher peak frequency period are proposed to further
enhance availability of service from Denver Union Station. The subsequent increase in cost is included in
the current proposal, which is fundable through its CMAQ grant.
SUMMARY OF PROPOSED SERVICE CHANGES

Routes proposed for service improvements:
Route 62 – Commerce City/Stapleton: proposal postponed.
Route 83L – Parker/Leetsdale: add a 5:04am weekday and 5:39am weekend trips from Civic Center
Station to Nine Mile.
Route 121 – Peoria Street: shift 12:15am from 40th & Airport Station to 12:45am.
Flatiron Flyer – US 36 BRT: add one PM eastbound Route FF6 trip
Free MetroRide: increase peak period frequency to operate every 4.5 minutes.

Routes proposed for service reductions:
BroncosRide and CU/CSU Game: discontinue BroncosRide and CU/CSU special service from the
Montbello park-nRide.

Routes proposed for mixed service improvements/service reductions:
Route 3 – Alameda Avenue: cutback 2:57pm eastbound trip from Federal Center Station, to instead
originate at Lakewood Commons at 3:15pm.
Route 31 – Federal Crosstown: extend and convert a Route 30 trip to 72nd Avenue as a Route 31 trip
and shift the afternoon northbound school tripper.
Route 72/72W – 72nd Avenue Crosstown: convert 72W trips into 72 trips.
Route BOLT – Boulder/Longmont: convert selected peak trips to become express trips.

Routes proposed for routine running time analysis/schedule adjustments
Route 1 – 1st Avenue: running time analysis to improve on-time performance
Route 3 – Alameda Avenue: adjust evening trip times
Route 11 – Mississippi Avenue: adjust evening trip times
Route 16 – West Colfax: minor schedule adjustments
Route 28 – 28th Avenue: minor schedule adjustments
Route 51 – Sheridan Boulevard: minor schedule adjustments
Route 66 – Arapahoe Road: running time and trip time adjustments
Route 76 – Wadsworth Boulevard: minor schedule adjustments
Flatiron Flyer – US 36 BRT: routine schedule adjustments

Seasonal Service Changes
School Service
Resume seasonal school service on the following routes:
Routes 1, 9, 11, 24, 30, 30Ltd, 31, 51, 52, 65, 73, 100, 206/206F and 208/208F
(Route 43 school tripper service replaced by increased frequency on the Route 43)
Routes BOUND, DASH, JUMP, SKIP and STAMPEDE: Change to fall/winter schedules.
Route N – Nederland/Boulder: reinstate routing to Eldora Ski Resort.

Packet Pg. 324

12.K

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The overall financial impact contained in this proposal is estimated to be $537,935 annualized, with
$490,175 being funded through CMAQ grants, resulting in a net base system impact of $47,760.
EQUITY ANALYSIS
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and
Executive Order 12898 regarding Environmental Justice. In this circular, the FTA requires RTD to
evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that exceed the established major service
change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a disproportionately negative impact on
minority or low-income populations. Our evaluation of the proposed August 2016 service changes does
not reveal any disparities in impacts absorbed by minority or low-income populations.
A Look Ahead – January 2017
The following items are service concepts currently under consideration or are planned events that impact
operations in the next service change period:
Route 43 – Martin Luther King Boulevard
Due to the likely increase in ridership caused by extending the service to the Auraria Campus the peak
periods will have to be monitored for need of additional capacity.
E Line
Responding to recent growth on the E Line weekday midday period (9:30 AM-2:30 PM) warrants an
increase in service to provide 15-minute service.

longer operate from the Park-n-Ride. Service to Sports Authority Field will be available by
taking the new University of Colorado A-Line service to Denver Union Station and
transferring to a C, E or W-Line train. An average Broncos game carries approximately 56
passengers and the CU/CSU game has been averaging 4 passengers over the past two
years. Savings: $13,200 annual costs

August 2016 Service Change
Public Meeting Comments

Thursday, May 19th, 2016
Longmont Senior Center
5:30 PM
Facilitator: Nataly Erving
The meeting was started at 5:35pm with RTD Staff in attendance: Director Judy Lubow,
David Menter. City of Longmont Staff in attendance: Phil Greenwald; City of Longmont
TAB representatives: Buzz Feldman, Bob Lee
4 members of the public attended.
Lynn Philippsen requested that the stop at Table Mesa and Tantra Drive be considered as a
stop on the US36 BRT Flatiron Flyer routes. She stated that the walk to the closest BRT
stop was too far. Staff pointed out that local underlying service on routes DASH and 206
is available and that at this time demand at this stop location does not warrant for it to be
a BRT stop. Staff will continue to monitor demand in this regard.
Bob Lee liked the proposed changes for the BOLT, J and L stops, as well as the Bolt
Express trips. He stated that he would like to see the fare for route BOLT to be local all the
way between Longmont and Boulder and urged RTD staff to reconsider the recent fare
zone change. He also requested that RTD staff look into airport service from Longmont to
Denver, as well as a meeting to discuss various options in this regard with city staff and
members of the TAB. RTD staff will coordinate with City of Longmont staff to set up such
a meeting.
Buzz Feldman also stated that he agreed with the proposed changes and asked when they
would go into effect. He suggested that instead of calling the faster trips on route BOLT
‘express’ to reference them as ‘Limited’ in order to not be too confusing or perhaps
misleading, since the trips will serve all of the agreed upon stops for regular route BOLT
within Longmont and then only travel at a faster pace once outside of the city. Staff
agreed that this would be a good idea and that they would consider doing so.
Peter Lloyd was concerned about the connections from route BOLT to route 206 and
having to walk from 28th Street to Boulder Junction in order to now make his connection.
Upon review of the proposed BOLT Express trips he however noted that they would most
likely provide a good alternative and better connection for him to get from Longmont to
the East Flatiron Business Park. He also encouraged staff to make sure that the
connections to these express trips from route 324 at 8th & Coffman Park-n-Ride be
considered. In addition, he requested to have route FLEX consider making better
connections at Boulder Junction to route 206.
Rolf Kaumann stated that he is a route L (LNX/LSX) passenger and appreciates the service,
as well as that RTD staff is willing to listen to customer concerns and input. He asked why
routes LNX and LSX have to ‘loop’ via 21st and Terry Street before continuing their trips

and requested for staff to look into the elimination of this routing since it could save up to
5 minutes of travel time.
Andrea Papa requested that there be a later LNX or LSX trip in the AM peak that would
better match the 9am work shift start time in Downtown Denver.
Phil Greenwald pointed out that the city is in the process of developing a community
development plan and that within that plan there are suggestions for future bus routes,
including a potential routing for a true BOLT Express, which would avoid multiple railroad
crossings within Longmont.
The meeting closed at 6:30pm.

12:00 noon
This meeting was started at 12:00 Pm with 7 public participants. RTD Staff in attendance:
Jessie Carter, Diane Marquiss, Doug Monroe, Cooper Langdon, Jeff Dunning. The
following comments were made during the meeting:
Margarita T. Barcelo’ (Marsala) – She was concerned about the service to Auraria Campus
as she heard that the current service, Routes 6 and 43, were temporary and soon to be
discontinued. Jessie informed her that the service was there to stay as we had just made
the changes to have the routes serve the Auraria Campus.
Mary Beth Patterson – Was asking about the CV changes to the 5:07pm express trip up to
Pine Junction. She does not want that trip changed to a CS that services the Federal
Center. Doug Monroe explained that the wording on the public notice was a little
confusing and informed her that the CX will not be changed to the CS. He also told her
that some of the other CV trips may be shifted slightly to provide better overall service.
Glenn Ressmeyer – Glenn started out by saying how much he likes the new A-line service.
However, he said he does not like the changes we have made with the bus service on the
east side of town associated with the A-line opening. He specifically mentioned the Rte
153 and 121. He said the changes have negatively impacted his commute to the Denver
Tech Center and he would like to see the service changed.
Jackson Deak – He represents a disabled group of passengers and would like to have the
Route 15L stop at Colfax and High St. He would also like to see more frequent service on
the Route 3. Jeff Dunning explained that the Route 3 may end up with more frequent
service and that it was unlikely the 15L would stop at High Street because adding stops to
the 15L would defeat the purpose of the route being a Limited stop service.
Geoffrey Bateman – He was with Jackson Deak and wanted to know what factors are
considered when planning a route and deciding which stops will be served. He was asking
because of their desire to have Colfax/High added to the stops on the 15L. Jeff Dunning
explained the factors we consider against what type of route we are operating, in this
instance a “Limited”.
Gina Richards – She commented on, what she perceived, was reduced service to the
Montbello neighborhood since the A-Line opened. Jessie Carter explained the service
changes to her and how they provide an overall service improvement to the area. She also

wanted to know if RTD had a community outreach group that she could contact regarding
current and future service changes.
Jessie told her she could reach out to the
Service/Planning department directly or we could get her the correct contact for the
community outreach group. She said she would check our website herself and didn’t
want to provide us with her contact information.
Kevin – Kevin is an ADA passenger and wanted to know about the new Commuter Rail
service and how it would impact his commute from Lafayette. Doug Monroe went over
some of our service that would benefit him the most. He left his contact information so
we could reach out to him with information.

6:00 PM
This meeting was started at 6:00 PM with 2 public participants and one RTD Staff
member. The meeting began at 6:15 PM and was concluded at 6:40 PM. The following
comments were made during the meeting:
Helen Lee – Does not understand the thoughts behind changes to the Broomfield CnR, as
related to the introduction of the Superior Call-n-Ride. Her commute pattern does not have
a fixed-route alternative, where the area covered by the new Superior Call-n-Ride has
alternative service, she opined. She would like to have the former service area restored.
Kenneth C. - Formerly used the Route 40 trips to UPS and currently uses the Route 37. He
requested that RTD recreate the later morning and afternoon trips that were available on
the Route 40 for “late shift” workers at UPS.

Committee Background
Committee Chair Francone thanked everyone for attending and let the
committee know we would be speaking to the process and setting up some
ground rules as well as reviewing materials. Barbara has prepared for us a
notebook of all materials that will be used throughout this process. Included
in your packet were the 4 approved policies used in the process of
determining and evaluating the position of General Manager. These four
policies were created as a result of the 2010 Legislative Audit. At that time
it was mandated a committee be set up for the purpose of GM oversight and
performance evaluation.

Approved Policies
Goal Setting Policy, Performance Evaluation Policy, Benchmarking Policy,
Approved Compensation Philosophy

Committee Chair Francone spoke to the approved policies that were in the
packet as the guidelines utilized in the process of evaluating the General
Manager. The goal setting is tied to the results of the Board/Senior
Leadership retreat we attended in March. GM Genova will be speaking to
those 4 priorities at the Study Session scheduled for April 26th of this
month. GM Genova made the correction that there were 3 priorities and not
4. Committee Chair Francone thanked him for the correction. Committee
Vice-Chair Bagley clarified that the Study Session was an informational
session in reviewing the GM Tactical Plan and the GM Oversight and
Performance Management Committee was charged to do an in depth review
of the tactical goals to determine how and where the tactical goals are
placed as part of the overall evaluation process. Once the details of the core
and task goals are determined, the committee will bring the
recommendations to the full Board. Committee Vice-Chair Bagley asked if
there was mutual understanding of the process. Director Anderson said this
is the way it has been completed in the past.
GM Genova said the Tactical Plan as presented provides the basis for
developing the task goals in the evaluation. Committee Vice-Chair Bagley
reiterated the core goals fall out of the job description while the tactical fall
out of the 2016 retreat for the 2017 performance evaluation. Committee
Chair Francone reminded everyone that the presentation is given in the
broadest of terms and this committee will work with and massage all of the
elements to get them into the framework of the evaluation. Committee
Vice-Chair Bagley pointed out the importance of the policies in place and the
need for the committee to fully understand their content. Committee Chair
Francone agreed that all policies are important to understand but particularly
the Compensation Philosophy which Committee Vice-Chair Bagley said has
caused some differences in the past. Committee Chair Francone reminded
the committee that these policies are the foundation of what the committee
does and is the basis of how we move forward in the evaluation. She asked
if all the committee members were in agreement with the process as
outlined and the policies that are currently in place. Not hearing any
comments she would called for a motion.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 19, 2016 3:30 PM (Committee Reports)

As committee members we are tasked with the following 2 items: Following
through on the 2016 Performance Evaluation process of General Manager
Genova and Goal Setting and Performance Evaluation preparation for 2017.

Committee Vice-Chair Bagley moved that the present methodology and
policies be continued through the 3rd quarter of 2016 in the evaluation
process and into 2017. Director Anderson seconded and the motion was
passed unanimously.


Proposed 2016-2017 General Manager Goal Setting and Evaluation Timeline
Committee Chair Francone reviewed the Goal Setting and Evaluation Timeline with
special emphasis on critical dates with the committee. Committee Vice-Chair
Packet Pg. 334

6.A

Director Walker spoke to the tight timeframe in the fall and suggested the
committee may need additional meeting dates as the process does not allow
extended turnaround times in the decision making period. Committee Chair
Francone asked GM Genova if he had any additional comments. He responded he
is ready to move forward with 2017 Tactical Plan for the Study Session on
Tuesday, April 26th and understands the 2016 process as well.
Committee Chair Francone asked if there were any questions or was the committee
in agreement. Director Anderson reiterated that the core goals fall out of the job
description and the tactical goals are determined by this committee.
Director Menten thought the core goals need to be updated for 2017 as in the
example they are outdated and asked the committee to go to the manual section 7
to review the goals. Director Anderson spoke to the process of the General
Manager giving us the current elements that fall into each category under the core
goals. The General Manager and the committee will determine through the tactical
plan which elements will be placed under each static core goals as the elements in
advancing those goals. Director Menten said she thought what she was hearing
was that the core goals are touchable and can be changed for 2017 based on the
specifics presented by the General Manager. Committee Chair Francone said we
were probably premature in looking at this since GM Genova will be presenting the
Tactical Plan on April 26th and we would revisit the core goals at a later date.
Director Walker said as he understands the process that specific elements of the
core goals change over time.
The motion was made by Committee Vice-Chair Bagley to leave the core goals for
2017 as is and was seconded by Director Anderson and passed unanimously.


Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 19, 2016 3:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Bagley commented that two key dates are as follows: on or before July 12th the
committee would formalize the goal setting process with GM Genova and move the
action forward for full approval of the Board on July 19th. Committee Chair
Francone went over the critical dates for the 2016 evaluation. November 1st the
GM will provide to the committee his self-assessment for 2016 performance
evaluation and on November 15th the committee discusses the possibility of a
discretionary payout. On November 22nd the GM Oversight and Performance
Management Committee invites the full Board to discuss the evaluation and payout
recommendation. Final recommendations are made on December 6th moving the
recommendation to the full Board on December 20th. Committee Chair Francone
asked if there are any questions.

Review Performance Evaluation
Director Walker asked if any committee members would be proposing changes to
the committee much like Director Menten did last year. He feels if so, the sooner
the better in all fairness to GM Genova since he may choose different paths
depending on how his goals are structured within the evaluation process. Director
Menten said she would like to propose some changes which is why she questioned
the turnaround time in July in making that decision. Director Walker explained on
the timeline the vertical arrow to the right of the milestones indicated there would
be meetings scheduled for this committee starting in May until July in which those
decisions will be made prior to taking the formal goals to the Board on the 19th of
July. Director Anderson explained that July is the deadline and it is critical as the
decision has a direct impact on approval of the budget and we all should be

Bi-Annual Board of Directors Surveys
Committee Chair Francone discussed the process of the online Survey Monkey
survey that is sent out to the Board on a bi-annual basis. It was determined in the
past that quarterly was to frequent and we were not getting valuable data. In
2014 the survey was sent in April and October, but being slightly behind this year
as a result of the General Manager Executive Search, we will prepare and send the
survey in June and October. Director Anderson mentioned it will be valuable
information to have in finalizing the 2016 GM evaluation.

General Manager 2017 Tactical Plans
David Genova, General Manager and CEO, reviewed a Power Point Presentation with the
Board that was included in the April 26, 2016 Study Session Agenda Packet. It covered
his proposed Tactical Plans for the Strategic Goals/Priorities established during the March
5th, 2016 RTD Board/Senior Leadership Team (SLT) Advance. These goals are meant to
drive the 2017 budget cycle. He reminded the board that the top three priorities that
came out of the Advance are:
 Fiscal Sustainability (Strategic Goal #1)
 Workforce Human Capital (Strategic Goal #2)
 State of Good Repair & Operations and Maintenance (Strategic goal #3)
General Manager Genova pointed out that a detailed write up was included in the Agenda
Packet. He explained that these items have not yet turned into SMART (Specific,
Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, Time-bound) goals and he would be developing the
tactical plan further in conjunction with the General Manager Oversight and Performance
Management Committee. He would be working with the Committee over the next few
months with the goal of presenting the tactical plan to the full Board about mid-summer.
General Manager Genova reviewed the Board and staff focus areas as follows:
Strategic Goal Number One: Fiscal Sustainability
 Building Reserves
 Discuss Impacts
 Maintain Service Levels
 Monitoring
 Live Within our Means
 Identify New Revenue Sources
Strategic Goal Number Two: Workforce/Human Capital
 Pension
 Union Negotiations
 Health and Welfare
 Morale
 Recruitment/Retention
 Training/Development
 Succession Planning
 Recognition

Working Conditions

General Manager Genova noted that further details could be found in the April 26, 2016
Study Session Agenda Packet. He asked if the Board had any questions or comments.
Director Bagley thanked General Manager Genova for his highlights of his Tactical Plan for
the 2017 Strategic Goals, which align to the core goals for General Manager Genova. He
shared that as the Vice-Chair of the General Manager Oversight and Performance
Management Committee he looks forward to working with General Manager Genova in the
coming months to get a more detailed plan for each of these points. He stated that he
had found the packet fairly complete and thanked General Manager Genova for his
presentation.
Director Deadwyler asked about the topic of ensuring service and accessibility. She noted
Access-a-Ride had not been included in General Manager Genova’s presentation. She
wondered if the reason for that was because Access-a-Ride was not RTD’s responsibility
and was being left up to the contractors. General Manager Genova indicated this was an
oversight as it is to be part of the plans mentioned.
Director Menten commented that General Manager Genova indicated that sales tax parity
has increased RTD’s revenue; she is hearing conflicting reports on this topic and asked for
more information. Heather Copp, Chief Financial Officer and Assistant General Manager of
Finance and Administration, stated that it has been hard to measure because it started at
the same time as retail marijuana sales as well as a bump in the economy. She said
around several million dollars a year is contributable to that parity but it is really hard to
come up with an exact number. She noted if it had been done in isolation it would have
been much easier but this time that is just staff’s best guess based on a comparative
analysis.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 26, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Strategic Goal Number 3: State of Good Repair/Operations and Maintenance
 Safety and Reliability
 Maintaining What We Have
 Ensure Service and Accessibility
 Maintain Infrastructure
 Meet Federal Standards
 Maintain Facilities

Director Menten noted that General Manager Genova mentioned contributions that were
made to make the Health and Welfare Trust to make it healthy. She stated that is not
how she would describe it. The contributions were really what she would call bandaging a
severe wound. General Manager Genova responded that her interpretation was correct; he

Packet Pg. 339

6.B

would not say it has been fixed it in its entirety but there have been some significant steps
taken to keep it solvent. He stated the Health and Welfare Trust would be one of the
items addressed during the next contract negotiations with the Union. Director Francone
thanked David for a very thorough and easy to understand presentation. She added that
she is looking forward to working with General Manager Genova as the Chair of the
General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee to flush out these
goals and turn them into SMART goals in the next month.

Strategic Budget Plan Development Process and 2017 Budget Assumptions
Jannette Scarpino, Senior Manager of Budget and Financial Analysis, reviewed a Power
Point presentation that was included in the April 26, 2016 Study Session Agenda Packet.
She reminded the Board that the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) is RTD’s six year financial
plan for the Base System that must result in a balanced budget. FasTracks expenses and
projects are included in the FasTracks Annual Program Evaluation (APE) financial plan.
She said the goal is to combine the SBP and APE into one long-range plan going forward.
Jannette Scarpino explained that staff starts with the 2016-2021 SBP capital programs as
a baseline to develop the current SBP. These projects are prioritized and evaluated using
mission statement criteria and 2017 strategic goals. She said the SBP is comprised of
operating elements (bus service, rail service, and operating and passenger facilities) and
capital elements (fleet plan and operating passenger facilities and equipment).
Jannette Scarpino noted there are several revenue and cost assumptions used in
development of the SBP which are:
Revenue Assumptions
 Sales and use tax growth rate
o 2017: CU-Leeds School of Business currently forecasts 5.6% increase over
2016
o 2018-2020: based on semi-annual forecasts from CU-Leeds School
o February 2016 collections are 1.9% over February 2015
o February 2016 collections are 3.1% below budget
 Fare Revenue
o Assume system-wide 8.0% fare revenue increase in 2016 over 2015 actual
o Fare revenue for 2017 will be established with formulation of 2017 Budget
o Per policy, Board will consider a fare rate increase every 3 years with
scheduled increases in 2019 then 2022
 Federal grants
o Based on actual 2016 appropriations
o Recognized as awarded
o Assumed to increase at rate of inflation or as identified

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 26, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

III.

Packet Pg. 340

Cost Assumptions
 Operating and maintenance costs
o Based on 2016 Amended Budget
o Costs escalated at rate of inflation
o Collective Bargaining Agreement incorporated as fixed through 2017 then
escalated at CPI
 Diesel fuel costs
o Locked at $2.23 per gallon in 2016
o Volatile commodity
o RFP for 2017 vendor contract underway
o Conservative cost assumptions and escalated at national inflation rate
 Debt service
o Interest payments on existing debt and assumed financing
 Inflation rates
o Based on Moody’s forecasts of February 2016
o Denver-Boulder inflation rate: 3.0% in 2017
o National inflation rate: 3.1% in 2017
Jannette Scarpino pointed out that there are many issues and challenges in developing the
SBP. The next steps are to review and prioritize SBP departmental requests for capital and
expense projects, develop funding strategies and calibrate ridership/fare revenue
estimates. She will be presenting the first draft of the SBP at the May Financial
Administration and Audit Committee Meeting with an update in June. Staff hopes to bring
the final SBP to the Board in July for approval so the 2017 Requested Budget process can
begin in August with adoption of the Budget in November.
Director Walker noted that ridership had been adjusted downward to 1.5% due to the
effect of the fare increase. He wondered if staff had data at the local, regional, day pass,
etc. level to show if there had been increases or decreases in fare revenue for each of
those media to offset the decrease in ridership. Jannette Scarpino responded that staff
did not break it down at that level but were just looking at an overall fare revenue increase
and ridership increase.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 26, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Anderson noted she had seen some information where it appeared that some
fares went up while other fares went down. She wondered if perhaps they could cancel
each other out. Jannette Scarpino stated that was a true statement. She indicated staff is
also leaning on the FasTracks expansion to provide some support to the fare revenue
estimates. She said it is a somewhat aggressive assumption but it is obtainable. Staff will
have to monitor actuals for the remainder of the year and will report back.

Director Bagley noted that the Diesel fuel lock in 2016 is $2.23 per gallon. He wondered
if staff has a sense of what it would be if we were to lock in today’s environment.
Jannette Scarpino responded saying the future market for 2017 has been somewhere
around $1.65 - $1.70. Since then gas prices have trended up a bit so she suspects that
number is slightly to the north of $1.70. General Manager Genova added that we are
expecting proposals for a fuel lock vendor by May. He explained that staff has asked for
something a little different as it is a competitive environment. The Request for Proposal
asked them to include what their lock would be for 2017 when they submit their
proposals; however, there is typically a risk premium included on top of a fuel lock as they
are hedging that prices are likely to go up. He does not believe a provider would lock in
this environment.
Director Lubow thanked staff for presenting an interesting, thorough and comprehensive
review to the Board. Director Lubow wondered if staff had thought about increasing the
contributions to the fund balances so that they would become fully funded earlier.
Jannette Scarpino responded that we could always increase the contribution. Staff
typically brings forward the SBP with a contribution of $3 million to each fund. She
pointed out that the SBP has historically been fairly tight so staff tends to leave that
contribution at the minimum $3 million to each fund. She shared that staff run a variety of
scenarios to see what the impact would be in adding more money. Heather Copp further
stated that, as was mentioned in the Tactical Plan, fund balances are one of the things
that came up in the advance. Staff is looking to build up our reserves sooner while we
are experiencing sales and use tax growth rates in the 4-5% range as that will not last.
Director Menten requested more information regarding what the fare media purchases are
pre-2016 and now. She wonders how much the day passes are being used compared to
before, what were the sales of express/regional versus the combined fare now, etc.
Director Menten commented that the first fare increase she experienced was the major
overhaul of the entire fare structure as well. She wondered when staff would start to look
at the 2019 increase. She believes it will be a lot less time than this past one but maybe
not. General Manager Genova responded that this would be quite different compared to
what we just went through as the last effort looked at the overall fare structure,
categories of fares, all of the zones on the rail system, etc. as well as looking at the rates.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 26, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Anderson complimented staff for the charts from Moody’s as it is great
information to have on hand. She thought it was interesting to see what the percentage
of sales tax RTD gets for different categories. She shared that in the paper today there
was a forecast that motor vehicles are not selling as well as they have in the past. She
sees that as a real jolt to RTD’s sales and use tax revenue. She thanked staff for
providing more detailed sales and use tax information as they are great reference pieces
for the Board.

Director Sisk thanked staff for the presentation. He stated that he is always interested in
efficiencies. He noted that staff puts a great deal of time into the SBP and wonders if
perhaps there is a more efficient way to keep the Board informed. He challenged staff to
think about if there was a better way to do the SBP. Heather Copp said that staff will
have to see how changes to the SBP process would fit into the long term planning as there
are plans that go out to 2040.
Chair Pro Tem Hoy thinks the most impactful comment is that sometimes we do things
because that is the way we have always done them. He does not know how Director
Sisk’s suggestion might work specifically but believes our processes are something that
should be looked at from time to time.
Director James appreciates Director Sisk’s skepticism. He agrees that just because it is
the way something has always been done is not necessarily a good reason to keep doing
it; however, as someone who does this in a different dimension, his sense is that doing it
annually is appropriate. In a six year plan staff has more confidence than in a 60 year
plan. Jannette Scarpino noted that things move pretty fast around here. She said
historically many of staff’s assumptions change rather quickly; however, she pointed out
that RTD’s business is also stabilizing. She indicated staff would take the comments into
consideration.
Director Walker thinks staff has a good idea of what our expenses are going to be but
revenue is a little more of a greased pig. Staff knows when we will need new buses but
we do not know what our revenue will be each year. He thinks it is prudent for the Board
to get updates about our expectations and making adjustments yearly. He stated as the
Board saw in 2007, the economy can change on a dime. He believes adjustments need to
be made quickly. He stated getting stuck in a rut is not always healthy but some level of
predictability is essential.

IV.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 26, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Due to all the complexities it was a very long drawn out process. He explained when we
look at a general fare increase the process has less analysis and is usually less in duration.
He anticipates the process would begin in early 2018 for a 2019 fare increase.

Other Matters
Chair Pro Tem Hoy thanked everyone at RTD and especially at our FasTracks Program who
made last week happen. He stated it was a monumental task, especially when thinking of
all the little pieces that came together to magically make that happen. He believes each
and every person that works for RTD should feel proud of their efforts and the
accomplishment. He noted that people were ecstatic about the opening.

General Manager Genova agrees that it was a huge day and weekend. He noted we
received incredible media exposure that we could not have purchased. He thanked the
entire RTD and Denver Transit Partner teams because the opening took everyone. He
shared there was a switch and signal issue around mid-day Saturday as well as a few door
issues but overall the opening was very smooth. He indicated staff had three after action
reviews and will continue to diligently monitor performance. He noted there was also a
brief bus bridge this afternoon between 40th and Airport but overall it has been a very
positive experience. He stated he was happy to see everyone really enjoying themselves.

B. Recommended Actions

• State Legislative Liaison Services
It is recommended by the Government Relations Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into an agreement for state
legislative liaison services with Brandeberry~McKenna Public Affairs (BBMK) to
exercise a one-year option (June 30, 2016 through June 29, 2017) to extend Contract No.
13-DX-00, at a cost of $122,000, pursuant to the Contract Award agreement.
Motion:

Chair Tobiassen made the motion to move this item to
the full Board at the May 31, 2016 Board Meeting.
Director Solano seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Sherry Ellebracht, Government Relations officer, stated that the team at
Brandeberry~McKenna Public Affairs (BBMK) does a fantastic job
representing RTD at the State Capitol. BBMK has a proven record at
being very effective in ensuring the bills RTD needs are passed. She
noted that included in the May 10, 2015 Government Relations
Committee Agenda Packet there was a summary report from BBMK
outlining all the work they have done over the years for RTD. She does
not think it is as comprehensive as what BBMK actually does but
provides a good overview. She encouraged the Board renew the contract
with BBMK.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 10, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Anderson participated via phone and Director Bagley arrived late. Directors Deadwyler, Folska
and Sisk were absent.

Jenifer Brandeberry, BBMK, stated that the BBMK team looks forward
to continuing to represent RTD before the General Assembly. She said it
has been an honor to represent RTD and something her staff take a lot of
pride in. She believes the partnership they have had with RTD staff and
Board members has allowed BBMK to have a great amount of success at
the State Capital.
Director Lubow expressed her gratitude to the staff of BBMK for the
work they have done on behalf of RTD. She said it has been a pleasure
working with them.

Packet Pg. 346

Committee Vice-Chair Francone shared that she has enjoyed working
closely with the staff at BBMK. She recognized how well they keep the
Board posted on upcoming legislation. She said their hard work is much
appreciated. BBMK is always very well prepared and look out for
RTD’s interests. She also thanked Sherry Ellebracht for her diligence.

C. Updates

• Local Update - CRL Associates
Sherry Ellebracht, Government Relations Officer, apologized on behalf of Roger
Sherman for his absence as he was traveling. She indicated that the report was included
in the May 10, 2016 Government Relations Committee Agenda Packet. She said she also
sent additional information in relation to the various Colorado contractor group’s funding
proposals.
Sherry Ellebracht stated Colorado Contractors Association, Associated General
Contractors of Colorado, the Colorado Construction Industry Coalition, and Move
Colorado (contractor groups) submitted ten (10) ballot initiative titles. The contractor
groups will now have to decide which one of these they will actually take to a ballot
election in November, 2016, if any. Sherry Ellebracht indicated that the Metro Mayors
Caucus (MMC) did not take a formal position; however, at the work session held on May
2 the consensus was not to support any of the proposals as currently written. The three
primary concerns cited for the MMC’s decision are:
 Lack of funds dedicated to transit
 Concern the statewide tax increase could preclude cities from raising local sales
taxes for needed infrastructure
 The inequitable distribution of funds

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 10, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Committee Vice-Chair Francone declared the motion PASSED.

The Metro Mayors Caucus (MMC) was very adamant that transit needed to be funded,
which is a positive for RTD. Staff will continue to monitor the progress of the ballot
initiatives as they move forward. Jenifer Brandeberry added that they will know soon
how the ballot will look. She said there had been several transportation funding bills that
died and there has been frustration with the lack of ability to pass anything at the State
level to fund transportation. She indicated the contractor groups would need to do
polling to determine what is passable and will garner enough revenue to make it
worthwhile.

Packet Pg. 347

6.C

Director Anderson thinks one of the good reasons that the MMC have refused to look at
this initiative is because it would preempt local governments from raising sales tax on
their own for transportation purposes. In the city of Arvada there are some transportation
needs that cannot be met under the State and the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) money. If
the contractor group’s initiative passes, then it would preempt the cities from having their
own sales tax for transportation needs. Sherry Ellebracht agreed that Director Anderson
makes a good point as some of these cities were very concerned with an additional sales
tax that would be bumping up taxes close to 10% in their communities. Some of the
cities would like to do their own local ballot for funding transportation and once you get
to a 10% sales tax that is pretty steep.

• State Update - Brandeberry - McKenna
Jenifer Brandeberry expressed that the end of the legislative session is about thirty (30)
hours away. She said she is happy to report that RTD will finish up the session in very
fine shape. She wanted to focus on three highlights that Brandeberry~McKenna Public
Affairs (BBMK) have spent a lot of time on for RTD this year:
 House Bill 16-1008 was passed allowing RTD to operate buses along the
shoulder of US 36.
 Senate Bill 16-123 dealt with the requirement of transponders for High
Occupancy Vehicles to use the US 36 express lanes that morphed into a larger
conversation about the High Performance Enterprise (HPTE) and public/private
partnerships. This bill died in the House Transportation Committee.
 House Bill 16-1325 would have required CDOT to post information about caucus
and election dates on variable message signs. When it became clear that they
were statutorily prohibited from doing that there was an amendment quickly
offered that would have required RTD to post the messaging. This bill died after
quick action by RTD staff and Directors after explaining how it would be cost
prohibitive.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 10, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Lubow wondered if the contractor groups would move forward without an
endorsement from the MMC. Sherry Ellebracht responded that it will depend on the
polling and the level of support they see. As it is a sales tax and not something like a gas
tax, the polling results may show some push back. She said it also depends on who will
be willing to fund a campaign that could cost millions of dollars for something that might
not be very popular.

Julie McKenna, BBMK, shared with the Board information on Senate Bill 16-194, which
was introduced by the City of Broomfield and has now been passed in the Senate
Transportation Committee. The bill creates the “Regional Transportation Development
Act,” which allows a city, county, town or local government to apply to the state
transportation commission for approval of a regional transportation development project.
SB16-194 as written would not take any funds from RTD. It allows creation of new
“authorities” to build highway or transit projects. These authorities could be within the
District but the funding is state sales tax increment finance, plus what other public bodies
would want to contribute. She said this bill did die but will probably continue to be
discussed.

Packet Pg. 348

6.C

Julie McKenna indicated that affordable housing and construction defects continued to be
an important topic but there were a number of bills that did not go forward; however,
these are topics that are not going away. She said there are still several big issues that are
percolating that BBMK will continue to monitor. As they stand they do not impact RTD
but it is important to monitor if any amendments are made.
Julie McKenna thanked the Board for renewing BBMK’s contract. She said it has been
an honor to represent RTD.

Mike Dino, Squire Patton Boggs, shared that congress resumed their session earlier today
whereas the Senate resumed last night. There are approximately 3 weeks before the
Memorial Day holiday break. He noted they will be working throughout the summer;
however, due to the Presidential campaigns productivity might suffer. He said over the
next three weeks the Senate and House will try to get a budget and appropriations passed.
The Senate has passed their transportation appropriations and kept most programs at
current funding levels or higher. One of the things they have improved upon is the
Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) grant program.
Mike Dino noted the Senate appropriations also funded the New Starts Grant and
allocated $150 million for the Eagle P3 project. He indicated RTD asked for $167
million to make-up from a previous year shortfall, which we will eventually get. He
pointed out that $199 million was authorized for positive train control grants which might
present some opportunities for RTD.
Mike Dino commented that RTD will be submitting a Transportation Investment
Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) grant proposal in the range of $13 million for
the state of good repair and operational improvements for the Central corridor. He noted
that Directors briefed the delegation on this during the APTA Legislative Conference.
Mike Dino shared that General Manager Genova will be participating in a US
Department of Transportation (DOT) webinar on the finance plan and project
development for the Eagle P3 project. He also shared that last week Director Francone
General Manager Genova and he went out to the National Renewable Energy Labs
(NREL) to talk about the Department of Commerce’s i6 Challenge Grant. This grant is
concentrated on regional innovation strategies that bring different groups together and
focuses on economic development, jobs and business opportunities. The meeting was to
discuss strategies to partner with NREL and other businesses that may be eligible for this
grant.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 10, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

• Federal Update - Squire Patton Boggs

Director Menten asked about receiving a copy of the TIGER grant application for $13
million. She wondered if it would include specifics of what the funds would cover.
General Manager Genova responded that he would forward a copy to Director Menten.
He explained that the application would detail the state of good repair work and installing
a pocket track that would be part of the Central Rail extension.

Packet Pg. 349

6.C

Committee Vice-Chair Francone thanked Mike Dino for accompanying General Manager
Genova and herself to the NREL meeting. She thinks the i6 Grant is an opportunity for
RTD to pursue a revenue stream in the future. Mike Dino added that the NREL tour they
took of the Research and Development facility highlighted advantages to renewable
energy or alternative energy modes that could be advantageous to RTD.

Director Bagley shared that he was late this evening as he attended a going away reception for
Jim Gunning, Mayor of Lone Tree. Director Bagley has worked alongside Mayor Gunning for
the last seven and half years and at one time had pieces of Lone Tree in his District. He said he
has requested that General Manager Genova write a letter congratulating him on his eight year
term. Director Bagley referred to Mayor Gunning as being a leader of the Metro Mayors Caucus
and a champion of the Southeast corridor extension.
Director Bagley added that he and Chair Tobiassen attended the State of Downtown Denver
Event today that was hosted by the Downtown Denver Partnership, Inc. Director Bagley
requested the Board members read the 2016 State of Downtown Denver Report. He thinks it is
important to understand that the health of Denver makes everything else viable. This report is a
fantastic summary of extraordinary developments that have been happening in Denver that
benefit the entire region. Director Bagley further added that although he did not attend the
University of Colorado A Line inaugural ride, he did attend the reception before the official
public opening. Director Bagley congratulated all the staff and said it has been a fantastic
opportunity for the members of the Board to be involved with the entire Eagle P3 project. He
noted three Board members, Director Bill James, Chair Tom Tobiassen and himself, have been
here for the entire project. This FasTracks project is what makes this area one of the top regions
in the entire country.
Director Lasater complimented General Manager Genova for how he handled the hecklers during
his speech at the University of Colorado A Line opening. The hecklers made a disruptive scene
but General Manager Genova kept his composure and continued on with his speech. Director
Lasater also shared that he had attended the groundbreaking for the Southeast Rail extension and
it was well attended. Construction will start on May 16th and hopefully the extension will be
opened at the proposed March 2019 timeframe.
Director Bagley noted there had been a shakeup at APTA with Michael Melaniphy stepping down
as President and CEO after the Metropolitan Transit Agency of New York cancelled their APTA
membership. He asked General Manager Genova if he could speak about what has been
happening. General Manager Genova responded that for the last few years New York City’s
MTA was making rumblings about pulling out of APTA. Their main reason being that agency
dues are determined by how large the agency is and their dues were around $400,000 a year.
MTA felt that the representation they received was not worth the financial contribution. Shortly
after it was announced that MTA was no longer going to be a part of APTA, Michael Melaniphy
resigned. General Manager Genova recognized that APTA is currently in the process of making
changes, but he does not know what those changes will be. He added that APTA continues to be a
great body for RTD and the transportation industry as a whole. He believes they provide a
valuable service and are a good organization and he is interested to see what direction they take
the agency to next.

Director Anderson stated that she had attended the APTA Board Meeting prior to the Transit

the part of APTA and its many different members to continue to make it a valuable agency to
represent all of the transit associations throughout the whole of the United States.
Committee Vice-Chair Francone thanked Director Bagley for representing RTD at Mayor
Gunning’s farewell.

B. Recommended Actions

• RTD Citizens Advisory Committee Appointments
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee and the
Nominating Committee for the RTD Citizens Advisory Committee of the
Regional Transportation District (RTD) that the RTD Board of Directors
reappoint one member of the Committee to an additional three-year term and
appoint five new members to the Committee to a three-year term.
Motion:

Director Tobiassen made the motion to move
this item to the full Board at the May 31, 2016
Board Meeting.
Director Walker seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager of Communications,
shared with the Board some of the highlights regarding the
RTD Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) Appointments. On
February 18, 2016, recruitment for citizens interested in
serving was publicly advertised through the RTD and
FasTracks Web sites, media releases, local publications and
stakeholder e-mail distributions. Applicants were asked to
submit a one-page letter stating their interest in serving on the
CAC along with specific qualifications, highlights of related
experience and expertise, and a resume if available. A total of
45 applications were received by the March 31, 2016
deadline.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 10, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Anderson participated via phone. Directors Deadwyler, Folska and Sisk were
absent.

Two of the current serving members were eligible for
reappointment, of which one member committed to serve an
Packet Pg. 353

6.D

additional three year term. Following review of the application
materials, the nominating committee interviewed nine finalists.
The nominating committee came to a consensus on the
selection of the nominees for the CAC.

Director Lubow stated she was very impressed by the quality
of candidates that applied for the CAC and congratulated
Scott Reed and his team for their public outreach that
generated applicants with such a high level of expertise and
interest.
Director Walker said he was impressed with the breadth of
background of the candidates and that the appointees have
great qualifications.
Director Bagley thanked the nominating committee for
appointing someone from District H for the first time. Director
Hoy pointed out that there is no requirement that every
District has a CAC representative, but during the process it is
one of the aspects considered.

• Contract Amendment for the Westminster Park and Ride Pedestrian Bridge
Painting & Rehabilitation
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into a
construction contract amendment with TMI Coatings, Inc. in the amount of
$390,595.81. This Contract Amendment to the Westminster Park-N-Ride
(PnR) Pedestrian Bridge Painting & Rehabilitation Project (Contract No.
16DP001) is for the restoration of the adjoining access ramps to the
pedestrian bridge over US36 at the RTD US36 Sheridan Bus Rapid Transit
(BRT) Station. With this amendment, the total contract value would be
$839,283.74

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 10, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Scott Reed reminded the Board of an important change to the
CAC’s focus, which will now broaden to include advising on
topics agency-wide.

Motion:

Director Tobiassen made the motion to move

Board Meeting.

Discussion:

Henry Stopplecamp, Acting Assistant General Manager of
Capital Programs, introduced Cory Granrud, Manager of ParkN-Ride Design, and Michael Peters, Engineer IV, who were
with him this evening. He explained that staff was already
working on the pedestrian bridge through the Strategic Budget
Plan (SBP) process. He noted maintenance and rehabilitation
is an ongoing process for all RTD structures across the
system. RTD received a request from the US36 Corridor to do
some more work on the pedestrian bridge, which is why staff
is recommending the contract amendment.
Cory Granrud pointed out that the US36 & Sheridan Bus Rapid
Transit (BRT) Station Pedestrian Bridge over US36 was
constructed in 1995. This bridge is now showing signs of rust
and concrete damage that require rehabilitation. Staff issued
an Invitation for Bid (IFB) last year regarding the Pedestrian
Bridge painting and repairs but the quotes came in higher than
anticipated. He explained that staff restructured the bid and
put it out this year as a Request for Proposals (RFP) in order to
receive more thorough responses from more qualified
contractors submitting proposals. Staff accepted proposals
on March 25, 2016 from three prime contractors:
o Gonzales Custom Painting, Inc.
o TMI Coatings, Inc.
o RMA Group, Inc.
On April 6, 2016 a final evaluation and recommendation
meeting occurred where it was recommended by the technical
evaluation committee that the most technically qualified, and
mid-range cost proposal submitted that is within the project
budget, was contractor TMI Coatings, Inc. (TMI). A base bid
of approximately $450,000 was made and the contract
duration is 180 calendar days. The base bid contract will
restore the bridge as follows:
1. Prepare and paint steel members dark grey
2. Replace clear Lexan side panels
3. Remove chain link fence
4. Patch and coat concrete decks with a skid resistant
material

Cory Granrud stated this contract amendment will utilize
currently budgeted US36 BRT Local Expense funds.
Director Hoy shared that he was at US36 & Sheridan Bus
Rapid Transit Station when RTD began the Flatiron Flyer
service. The constituents were, for the most, part happy with
the service and ridership numbers have shown an increase in
that area since the introduction of the BRT system. He said
the only complaints he really heard were in regards to the
Pedestrian Bridge. After personally reviewing the bridge in
follow up to the complaints he noticed that the bridge was in
need of repair, especially with the increased volume of
customers using this bridge now due to the change in our
service Director Hoy stated he believes this project is
necessary.
Director Archuleta asked about the actual pricing submitted by
all three contractors. Cory Granrud responded that as far as
costs, TMI Coatings, Inc. came in the middle of the other two
but he did not have specific dollar amounts he could share
with Director Archuleta at this time. He pointed out that TMI
rated the highest during the technical evaluation for
knowledge and experience. He indicated TMI rates quite a bit
higher than the other two in these categories.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 10, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

The contract amendment will restore the adjoining ramps as
follows:
1. Repair the concrete support columns under the Denverbound side of US36
2. Replace the rain gutters and downspouts
3. Replace the green vinyl clad chain link fence with grey
galvanized chain link fence
4. Treat and coat the stay-in-place metal formwork of the
ramp decks located over walkways
5. Patch and coat the concrete decks with skid resistant
material.

B. Recommended Actions

• Pass Program Working Group
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the
Board of Directors approves and adopts the Pass Program Working Group
objective, commitments and guiding principles.
Motion:

Director Lasater made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the May 31, 2016
Board Meeting.
Chair Tobiassen seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager of Planning, said he
had Michael Washington, Title VI Manager, with him this
evening. He explained that the purpose of this
recommendation was to set the Pass Program Working
Group’s objective, commitments and guiding principles. He
stated this is a spate discussion from those that staff has been
having with Mile High Connects and the Affordable Fare Task
Force. The Pass Program Working Group (Working Group) will
be focused on RTD’s existing pass programs. He indicated the
dialog with the Affordable Fare Task force has continued and
staff will be briefing the Board on that status in the near
future.

Michael Washington reviewed a Power Point presentation with
the Board that is available in the May 10, 2016 Planning and
Development Committee Agenda Packet. He reminded the
Board that the Working Group came at the request of the
Board when the EcoPass pricing changes were made in
September of 2015. He stated the objective of the Working
Group is to improve RTD’s pass programs to better serve
customers of the District. To achieve this objective, the
Working Group will fulfill the following commitments: (1)
revisit and refine goals for each individual pass program, (2)
refine pricing and administration of each pass program, and (3)
recommend pass program policy revisions to the Board of
Directors.
Michael Washington outlined the Guiding Principles for the
Working Group as follows:
 Cost Effective Administration
 Equitable Access
 Improve Customer Convenience
 Increase Ridership
 Meet Strategic Budget Plan Revenue Targets
 Promote Greater Brand Loyalty
 Provide RTD Revenue Certainty
 Simplify Passenger-Operator Interaction
Michael Washington indicated after the Board approval of the
objective, commitments and guiding principles, staff hopes to
begin Working Group interviews over the summer with
initiation of Stakeholder Meetings in the fall.
Director Lubow noted that she thinks it is great that the
Working Group is being created. She remembered seeing that
this evaluation would be a fairly long process as we acquire
data from Smart Cards and asked if that was accurate.
Michael Washington stated the Working Group would begin
meeting in the fall and continue throughout 2017.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 10, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Lubow stressed the importance of Title VI and equity
issues. She stated it is extremely important to make sure
everyone is treated fairly. She hopes people from the
Affordable Fares Task Force and low income community will
be incorporated into this Working Group.

Packet Pg. 360

Director Bagley recognized that the purpose of this discussion
is not a focus on specific pass programs, but as he is receiving
many questions, he wonders about the availability of the
Neighborhood and Community EcoPass programs in other
locations besides Boulder. It is his understanding that these
programs are only available in Boulder. Michael Washington
stated that was not correct. Currently the apartment complex
near the University Station participates in the Neighborhood
EcoPass Program. He said additionally, there were more
communities participating but have since dropped out;
however, staff has also heard concern about being eligible to
participate in those programs so it is something the Working
Group will address. Director Bagley believes it needs to be
more robustly available because 99.9% of the program is
focused on Boulder.
Committee Chair James asked if it was a correct statement
that the Working Group will be comprehensive enough to visit
the EcoPasses and their functionality, cost effectiveness, etc.
Michael Washington said that was absolutely correct.
Director Menten noted that some time ago she suggested
putting stickers on light rail vehicles informing riders that they
need to tap their Smart Cards. She wondered if anything
further had been done with that idea as people are not tapping
like they should. She stated without taps RTD does not have
accurate ridership data. Michael Washington said one of the
things the Working Group would be looking at was fare
enforcement. General Manager Genova explained that staff’s
collective thought is that we need to work on methods to get
people to tap before they get to the train. If riders see the
stickers as they are boarding the train they are not going to go
back to tap. Director Menten believes it is still an inexpensive
way to remind riders to tap.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 10, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Menten asked how many trains have automatic
passenger counters (APC). General Manager Genova indicated
40 out of 172 trains currently have APC.
Director Menten asked for more details about what was meant
by promoting greater brand loyalty as a guiding principle.
Michael Washington explained that many of the pass programs
afford riders some savings if they use the pass at a higher
frequency. He believes it is important for the passengers to
see this benefit and hopefully become more loyal to RTD.
Packet Pg. 361

6.E

Director Francone stated she would be looking for real
ridership data when it came to evaluation of the pass program
pricing. She shared that she has received comments from
several universities who were considering offering the
CollegePasses for the summer but were very disappointed to
learn we did not have ridership data. She acknowledged there
is an issue with data collection but thinks it is key for the
Working Group to move forward.
Chair Tobiassen asked staff how they plan to ensure a diverse
composition for the Working Group so the stakeholders are not
all from Boulder. He wondered how they will reach riders that
are not currently represented through the EcoPass programs
such as those along the Colfax corridor. Michael Washington
stated that staff would be looking for a diverse geographic
representation as well as a diverse group of existing and
potential EcoPass customers.
Chair Tobiassen shared he was recently in Amsterdam and got
to ride their public transportation system. He pointed out that
on their system riders need to tap on and tap off. He said if a
rider forgets to tap off 6 times the card is disabled. He
commented that the price of the day pass was pretty good
compared to ours. Michael Washington indicated the Working
Group would be looking at different enforcement options and
considering the tradeoffs of each to determine if changes need
to be made.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 10, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Francone said she was pleased to see this review of
the pass programs. She commented that RTD can have the
greatest pass program in the world, but if no one knows about
it, it is not going to be very effective. She would like to see a
concerted marketing and public information effort to ensure
people know about these programs.

Director Hoy pointed out that the EcoPass is predominately
focused on large employers. His understanding is that 80% of
the employers in Colorado have around 15 employees. He
does not believe RTD reaches out to small employers. He
wonders if there is any potential for aggregating employers
based on industry, business association, etc. to reach
companies that could not qualify on their own. General
Manager Genova stated there are employers of all different
sizes that participate in the program.
Packet Pg. 362

General Manager Genova shared that staff has been having
ongoing meetings with various individuals at DIA about making
the EcoPass available to all employees. He noted there are a
lot of complexities to this, especially on the airport side. He
said staff has also been approached by Boulder County about
doing a county wide EcoPass and wondered how it might be
priced. He noted while that is a short question it is very
complicated to come up with an answer and staff is currently
analyzing how that might work. He said the City of Lafayette
has asked staff to consider something similar as well as
something comparable to the fare buy-up in Longmont. He
stated staff gets many different questions about how pass
programs could work in different ways so it is something that
needs to be considered moving forward.
Committee Chair James noted that all methodologies are on
the table at least for examination. General Manager Genova
stated that was correct if it was an existing pass program.
The Working Group will not be looking at new forms of
passes.
Director Walker shared that he has participated in three of the
pass programs offered by RTD. He noted many of the guiding
principles focused on the customer; however, in his experience
part of the success of the pass programs will fall on the
employers to promote them as well. He has worked for one
employer that had very high ridership while another employer
did not. He explained that the employer with high ridership
really encouraged participation.
Director Bagley believes any information garnered in
considering EcoPasses for Boulder County and the City of
Lafayette should also be made available to every county, local
government, etc. within the District so they can understand
what it would take should they want to do an EcoPass
program. He believes this would be received very well by our
jurisdictions.

Director Anderson agreed with Director Bagley that this
information should be made available to everyone. She noted
that the City of Arvada is very interested in EcoPasses with
the upcoming Gold Line opening. She wants this to be a fair
and open discussion and hopes staff will find a way to be
more inclusive of all communities.

• Regional Air Quality Council (RAQC) Grant Summary
Ignacio Correa-Ortiz, Senior Architect, reviewed a Power Point presentation
with the Board that is available in the May 10, 2016 Planning and
Development Committee Meeting Agenda Packet. He shared with the Board
that in 2014 RTD was awarded a Regional Air Quality Council (RAQC) Grant
for the purchase of Plugin Hybrid-Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) and Electric
Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE). Through direction from the Senior
Leadership Team a pilot program was created to establish a baseline for
EVSE usage at the Central Park Park-n-Ride (Central Park) as well as to
incorporate two PHEVs and one EVSE at the Elati Light Rail Facility. As part
of the pilot at Central Park, there would be no changes to the Parking
Management Plan, no additional parking fees and no electricity resale. He
said staff hopes to use the pilot program to make recommendations to the
Board for future policy approval.
Ignacio Correa-Ortiz noted there were 410,000 PHEVs sold between 2008
and 2015 with the United States representing 33% of the global stock. He
indicated as PHEVs become more popular RTD will see a demand for
charging stations at our Park-n-Rides. The goal of the pilot program is to
develop a policy that makes sense for RTD to address this need.
Director Archuleta inquired if there was a universal standard for the plug-in
interface. Ignacio Correa-Ortiz explained there were two types of plugs.
One is called the universal plug and the other type is specific to Tesla
vehicles; however, Tesla also includes an adapter that will fit into the
universal plug.

C. Updates

Director Francone asked for the amount of the grant. Ignacio Correa-Ortiz
stated it was a little under $30K.
Director Francone wondered why staff did not plan to resell the electricity at
the charging stations. Henry Stopplecamp explained that the projected cost
of the electricity was only $2K per year. Putting in the infrastructure for

Packet Pg. 364

6.E

credit card processing would end up costing more than $2K. He said after
the pilot program staff would determine what it would entail to charge for
electricity and how to structure the pricing.

Director Lubow expressed that this pilot program was very appealing to her.
She is very glad RTD is involved in trying to help this emerging technology.
Chair Tobiassen noted there are two spots for charging. He wondered how
it was determined who gets to uses the spaces. Ignacio Correa-Ortiz stated
it was on a first-come-first-served basis. There will be signs indicating that
there is a time limit for using the spots of 10 hours. He said in Los Angeles
they have found the average car is plugged in for 4.5 hours. Chair
Tobiassen expressed concern about this policy. He wonders what someone
will do if they have driven to the station expecting to plug-in and it is not
available. He suggested that perhaps in lieu of charging for electricity we
charge $45 per month, similar to our other reserved spaces. Henry
Stopplecamp pointed out that would provide charging for just a few
individuals within the District. The goal of the pilot program is to see how
the public uses the plug-ins on a wider scale.
Chair Tobiassen wondered what happens if a non-PHEV parks in the spots.
Henry Stopplecamp indicated people would be encouraged not to do that.
Ignacio Correa-Ortiz explained that was one of the reasons the pilot program
was implemented. It is staff’s hope that there will be enough information
gathered during the pilot to develop a parking management plan for the
charging stations. Chair Tobiassen commented that he already receives
complaints about the reserved parking space program and worries we are
just muddying the water more with the charging stations.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 10, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Francone inquired as to the number of PHEVs in Colorado. Ignacio
Correa-Ortiz stated he did not have an exact number. The most prolific state
is California, then Oregon, then Washington. Colorado is very close behind
Washington and there are many charging stations currently throughout the
district.

Director Sisk wondered how the location for the charging stations was
chosen. He thinks it would make sense to have them where there are the
most PHEVs in the District and wonders where that might be. Henry
Stopplecamp explained that the Central Park Park-n-Ride is brand new so it
was easy to put in the necessary infrastructure for a low dollar value. He
said it would be very expensive to put in the infrastructure in an existing
Park-n-Ride. Ignacio Correa-Ortiz noted that the Stapleton area is also a bit
of a desert for charging stations.
Director Menten wondered if it will be possible to measure how many
Packet Pg. 365

6.E

Director Hoy expressed concern that it will be hard to begin charging for
something that was initially given away. He wondered how staff plans to
deal with users who plug in and then go to work all day. He does not see
any incentive for these users to move their vehicles unless they are charged
a per-hour fee. He said there will be all sorts of problems that will need to
be ironed out but this seems like an obvious one. Ignacio Correa-Ortiz
stated Director Hoy has hit the nail on the head and this is one of the
reasons staff plans to come up with a recommendation for an hourly charge.
He believes this will be an issue that comes up during the pilot program.
Henry Stopplecamp commented that another goal of the pilot program is to
look at the behavior patterns of our patrons. After the pilot program if staff
cannot find solutions to the problems RTD is not out a lot of money and we
will have saved money on our own fleet so it is really a win-win.
Chair Tobiassen suggested that, as the program moves forward, staff
considers charging stations for electric bikes and scooters.
Director Menten noted the RAQC grant requires a five year duration. She
wondered if that means the pilot program had to continue for five years.
Henry Stopplecamp explained that RTD just needed to use the charging
stations for five years but there was no stipulation as to where we had to
put them. If the pilot program is deemed unsuccessful the charging stations
could be moved to another RTD facility.
Director Menten asked if the RAQC grant restricted RTD from charging for
electricity. Henry Stopplecamp stated it did not.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 10, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

different, unique vehicles use the charging stations. Ignacio Correa-Ortiz
stated there would be license plate recognition technology that will identify
individual users, the length of time parked at the charging station and how
much electricity they receive. Each user has a key fob or card registered to
them to be able to get electricity. Director Menten noted that means there
is the opportunity to charge people to use the charging stations. Ignacio
Correa-Ortiz stated that was correct.

Committee Chair James commented that this pilot program suggests PHEVs
are the next big thing; however, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory
(NREL) is experimenting with hydrogen fuel cells, so perhaps that will be the
next big thing.

D. Other Matters
General Manager Genova shared that Ignacio Correa-Ortiz was just appointed to the
Denver Planning Board. He said he was looking forward to Ignacio’s service in this
role. Committee Chair James congratulated Ignacio on his appointment.
Packet Pg. 366

6.E

Committee Chair James shared that recently the Rocky Mountain Institute had a
similar competition with Denver and Austin as finalists. He does not think Austin
looks very good because of a recent voter action causing Uber and Lyft to say they
were no longer going to operate there. He said it is easy to be optimistic about the
possibility that Denver will compete very well.
Director Archuleta said he recently attended a meeting in Sunnyside and the
commuters were very unhappy that the B-Line would not stop at the Elati Station.
Bill Van Meter explained that the Elati station would be served by much more
frequent service from the G-Line. He stated current models do not show a demand
for that connection until the line gets extended further north.
Director Francone thanked Director Menten, Henry Stopplecamp, Terry Emmons
and their staff for attending a meeting with Jeffco County Commissioner Rosier
about concerns over traffic issues that were created by the W-Line. She said it
was quite clear during the meeting that it was not an RTD issue but appreciated
staff’s professionalism.

Bill Van Meter reminded the Board that Denver is one of seven finalists for the
Smart City Challenge. The United States Department of Transportation (USDOT)
has pledged up to $40 million to help one city define what it means to be a “Smart
City” and become the country’s first city to fully integrate innovative technologies
such as self-driving cars, connected vehicles and smart sensors, into their
transportation network. He shared that Denver is taking the lead on the project and
RTD staff is supporting their efforts. He indicated RTD would benefit from some of
the funds if Denver is successful. He said applications are due at the end of the
month and he expects the USDOT to select the winner in late summer.

Core Goal #1 - Successful Delivery of Transit Services: Attain 80% performance
measures
GM Genova outlined what adjustments he had made to the goal giving the example
of taking Smart Card out as that project was scheduled to complete in 2016.
Director Anderson said this past week the University of Colorado A-Line was
problematic and she has a deep concern in managing Denver Transit Partners and
wonders if managing DTP should be reflected in this goal. GM Genova proposed to
add a point on managing DTP as he feels it appropriate and thanked Director
Packet Pg. 368

6.F

Anderson for her observation. Director Bagley asked if this was the appropriate
place to put this addition.



Core Goal #2 - Strong & Ethical Leadership Articulates vision, forms cohesive team,
regular team-building sessions, builds and maintains effective executive team, and
handles conflict
GM Genova has made no changes to this goal from last year and gave examples of
speaking engagements and 2 national webinars, internal and external
communications that he has been engaged in on an on-going basis in leadership
outreach. Committee Chair Francone also added GM Genova would give additional
examples of how he would outline the achievements to the Board and at that point
the Board would make a determination based on the criteria stated in the goal.
Director Bagley said he would accept that as a parameter.
Director Menten said the goal also speaks to team building and an in-house
employee survey would be a helpful indicator as to how the employees view the
leadership. She stated that when directors engaged in the employee outreach in the
GM search process they received valuable insight that might be considered. She
also stated the results of an employee survey should tie into the achieved and
exceed in this goal. GM Genova stated that finding a baseline and what would be
an acceptable percentage could be difficult and cautions that employee perception
may not be within his control and said this could be addressed in task goal number
2. Dave Genova spoke to employee appreciation and what activities had recently
been proposed and asked if he could bring this back to the committee in the
“exceeds expectation” category. Director Menten would like it addressed in some
manner either here or in the task goal and asked about the performance
management program. GM Genova said this would be a continuous improvement
for employee evaluation.

Director Bagley asked for an interpretation of the comments in the “exceed
expectations” section and asked for clarity of the stated goals. Committee Chair
Francone asked how he would define “outstanding and noteworthy service” and
that it should be more clearly defined. GM Genova gave an example of the 2015
Bronco’s parade which was a record day for ridership. Director Walker said that
example was objective as some constituents were happy and others did not have a
good experience. Director Bagley said when it comes down to the final review GM
Genova would outline each of the services and how each goal was reached. He also
made the comment that these goals are agency wide goals under Dave Genova’s
leadership and administration.

Director Anderson thinks getting the temperature in a different way like showing an
increase in promotions and is measureable but does not pit the employees against
the General Manager. Chair Tobiassen said there are processes and procedures to
determine best practices in the appraisal practices for other executives realizing you
would need a baseline. GM Genova said this could be internal and external and one
example would be a 360 review the supervisor utilizes this as an additional tool in
the evaluation. Director Walker said he is afraid we would on only get a snapshot
and the idea of a survey and he is not comfortable for the GM to be evaluated
through a survey. It is important to know how the employees feel but not to
evaluate against the GM.



Core Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management Oversees operating and FasTracks
budgets, ensures compliance with local, state, and federal reporting, and
development of financing plans for future projects.
GM Genova said he has made no changes from last year’s criteria. Committee Chair
Francone had questions about FasTracks and Operations budget and asked if GM
Genova would clarity structure and separation of those budgets. GM outlined that
the structure of the budget would stay the same since we still have FasTracks
corridors to finish and the capital and operations budgets still require separation.
Committee Chair Francone thanked GM Genova for the clarification.



Core Goal #4 Ensures Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO)/Affirmative Action
(AA)/Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE)/Small Business Enterprise (SBE).
Director Menten asked when the Triennial review was done through FTA. GM
Genova said he did not recall when the last review was completed but stated it was
a full review of everything under the FTA umbrella. He said he would check for the
date of the last review and let the committee know. He also stated the areas of
emphasis depend on the FTA issues at the time and that he know the FTA utilizes
and outside contract for its audits. Director Bagley asked if RTD paid for the audit.
GM Genova said he was not sure who pays for the audit and would get back to the
committee with that information.
Director Menten would like to see under “exceed expectations” the addition of some
language that would reflect structure strongly encouraging graduation from the
SBE/DBE program. GM Genova said he has some thoughts surrounding an incentive
program or awards ceremony in recognition of those companies that have utilized
the program as it was intended in reaching graduation and would encourage
graduation to all participants. In speaking to some of the teams some are interested
in graduating and other want to stay in the program for continued work. GM
Genova said he would make the requested changes for committee review. Director
Bagley requested GM Genova to use a redline format for the changes.



Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 24, 2016 3:30 PM (Committee Reports)

GM Genova again said it would be in the “exceeded expectation” category and it is
also hard to get full participation. Committee Chair Francone says she understands
the methodology behind the surveys and is not sure if it is appropriate in this
instance and there are many different tools that could be utilized. Director Bagley
gave an overview of what GM Genova would bring back to the committee. Director
Anderson mentioned that sometime in 2017 there would be some discussion
regarding the CBA and that during those times evaluations of GM would not be
appropriate.

Goal #5 – Effective Communications & Community Outreach: Keeps Board
informed, periodically meets with Board members, delivers presentations in local and
national venues, and continues Public Information/Public Relations planning and
implementation.
GM Genova outlined the changes he made from last year’s goal from develop the
2016 FasTracks and Public Information plans to continuing and implementing on a
greater scale including FasTracks and Operations district wide. Director Anderson
added this fits into the goals outlined in the March advance. Director Bagley
commented that the “exceeds expectation” category would need to include some
examples. Director Walker confirmed that relevant articles and national recognition
would be valuable as elements of this goal.

Packet Pg. 370

6.F

Task Goal # 1 Fiscal Sustainability.
GM Genova said he has defined the goal to outline the specific bullet points listed in
the advance. Director Bagley confirmed the bullet points were generally defined
correctly. Committee Chair Francone asked for GM Genova to explain in the
“exceed expectations” category what he meant by “advance mobility option” and
what that might look like. GM Genova outlined what his idea thought were for the
last mile as in working with Lyft and Uber to offer another service that did not have
a financial impact. He expanded on the fact that it is important that we are
inclusive to everyone in our mobility efforts and the Uber’s and Lyft’s of the world
are not currently accessible.
Director Bagley mentioned that just because a large percent of our constituents did
not have credit cards that we should not pursue all payment options available. GM
Genova said once we start mobile ticketing next year all options for payment will be
available.
Director Bagley asked if in the “exceeds expectation” bullet point 2 under revenue,
he feels that 5% is a large number and is not sure it is a goal can be met. Director
Anderson said if you take out all other defined criteria 5% is not a large number.
GM Genova commented station naming, driving up ridership and third party parking
would all contribute to this goal. Director Bagley asked if there have been
discussions to determine our financial condition. GM Genova said they have had
these conversations and currently in terms of capacity we do not have much to
work with.



Task Goal # 2 – Workforce/Human Capital.
GM Genova said this was a goal he had to start from scratch. He spoke to the
“achieved goal” as outlined and GM Genova explained the different types of the
training offered to employees and a mandatory training path within a particular time
frame for all salaried employees. He went on to outline what is done for employee
recognition and the Employee Recognition Event and defined some of the continuous
improvement model to encourage decision making and ownership for agency
processes. Peak Green Belt pilot is being offered agency wide. GM Genova spoke
to employee recognition and cited a few examples of what they are thinking and the
challenges in planning an agency wide event. The estimated budget could be as
high as $250 thousand dollars.
Director Walker asked about sponsorships. GM Genova said we do utilize our
vendors but was not sure if that would be the best way to move forward. Director
Bagley asked what the Bus and Rail rodeo events cost. GM Genova said he would
get those figures for Director Bagley as he did not have them at his fingertips. GM
Genova said the plan is to recognize the employees in early 2017 for all the work
done for the openings in 2016 and that they do have some small recognitions
planned at all the divisions over the summer such as Ice cream socials and
barbeques which can be executed at a small cost and high impact. GM Genova
spoke to the continuous improvement process working group that he implemented
for the recruitment, hiring and retention process that is currently in motion.



GM Genova said in the “exceeds expectations” he has added “meets bus driver
headcount” and that this would be a stretch target as he does not think we have
ever been at headcount since he has been here. Director Bagley asked if this

Packet Pg. 371

6.F

included the outside contractors as well. GM Genova said that vendor staffing is
not within our control therefore not appropriate to include this in our goal.

III.

Task Goal # 3 State of Good Repair – Operations and Maintenance
This was another goal that was completely new. GM Genova reviewed the
elements of the “achieved goals” to be in full compliance to the RTA safety and
asset management rulemakings. Create and measure through reliability reporting
and have a completed State of Good Repair evaluation. GM Genova explained the
“exceeds expectations” and the concept of backlog. Director Anderson asked
where and how can we be sure DTP and DTO are complying with the goal regarding
state of good repair. Dave Genova said we are the owner of the assets for DTP and
they are defined the same way we are and will be tracked and reported on in our
reporting structure.

Review Proposed Meeting Dates

B. Recommended Actions

• 2015 CAFR and Report to Governance
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors accept and enter into the record the District’s audited
financial reports relating to the year ended December 31, 2015 as prepared
by staff and audited by RTD's independent auditor, RubinBrown, LLP.
Motion:

Director Anderson made the motion to
move this item to the full Board at the
May 31, 2016 Board Meeting.
Director Folska seconded the motion.

Discussion: Heather Copp, Chief Financial Officer and Assistant General
Manager of Finance and Administration, and Doug MacLeod,
Controller, introduced Cheryl Wallace from the auditing firm of
RubinBrown, LLP (RubinBrown). Doug MacLeod recognized
staff members Sue Sandoval, Senior Manager of Accounting,
and Tom Barlow, Senior Investment Accountant. He noted
that they and their team have worked diligently since
September to get this audit completed.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 24, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Lasater and Sisk were absent. Director James arrived late and Director Deadwyler
left early.

Cheryl Wallace clarified the annual audit process with the
Directors. The ViewPoints presentation included in the
Financial Administration and Audit Committee Agenda Packet
for May 24, 2016 contains the communication that every
Packet Pg. 374

6.G

Cheryl Wallace noted that page 6 begins the required Auditor
communication. The left side of the report outlines the
auditing standards and the right side of the report is the
response from RubinBrown. She explained that RubinBrown
issued an unmodified report that was previously called an
unqualified opinion or a clean opinion. On page 7 of the
report, it is notated that RubinBrown planned and scoped the
audit through the engagement process. What is new for this
year was a new governmental accounting standard that was
effective January 1st 2015, which was adopted by RTD.
RubinBrown is also required to inform the Board if there are
any estimates used in the financial statements. There are
estimates because of capital assets and receivables. And
lastly, because of the Government Accounting Standards
Board Statement No. 68 (GASB 68), there is an estimate of
the pension liability. The financial statements are very clear
and concise and there were no difficulties encountered during
the audit. RubinBrown worked with the finance team and
other divisions throughout the District and there were no
difficulties. The only adjustment in the report is an indication
of an accrual which is a client prepared adjustment, not an
audit adjustment. There were no disagreements with
Management, no need for consultation and no other issues
which required attention.
The rest of the document has recommendations for best
practices, observations and suggestions for the District to
consider. One of the audit recommendations from last year
was to review the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and
Innovation Act (TIFIA) loan period of availability and how it is
recognized. Those recommendations were fully put into effect
this year. Additionally, RubinBrown made recommendations
related to how RTD recodes transactions, which have been
partially implemented. RTD staff is in the process of refining
the procedures. The last topic was reviewing the information
technology governance and controls. There is a multi-year
plan that is currently being implemented which is why that
recommendation is partially implemented.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 24, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

auditor is required to provide to a governing body. She stated
that RTD has retained RubinBrown to perform an independent
audit on the financial statements. Since RTD has received
federal awards over $500,000, RTD has also engaged
RubinBrown to issue an opinion on RTD’s federal awards.

• Resolution No. ___, Series of 2016 related to the issuance of RTD Sales Tax
Revenue Bonds, Series 2016A
It is recommended by the Finance Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the
“Resolution”), authorizing the issuance of Regional Transportation District
Sales Tax Revenue Bonds (FasTracks Projects), Series 2016A.
Motion:

Director Anderson made the motion to
move this item to the full Board at the
May 31, 2016 Board Meeting.
Director Solano seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Heather Copp noted that Dee Wiser of Butler Snow, Chris
Elmore of Goldman Sachs, and Mike Newman of First
Southwest were all present to answer questions if there was
anything staff could not answer.
Brenden Morgan, Senior Manager of Debt and Investments,
explained that the resolution allows for two items. The first is
for new money for new projects, including the Southeast Rail
extension. The second allows for potential refinancing of the
2010A and 2012A FasTracks bonds if market conditions allow
for such refinancing to be economically beneficial to the
District. As of now, refinancing is not an attractive option but
the resolution will allow staff to react should the opportunity
arise. The resolution sets parameters for the sale of these
bonds and limits the principal amount to $200 million dollars.
The maturity is limited to the year 2046, and the maximum

Cheryl Wallace stated as the Board looks forward, there is a
new GASB relating to fair values which will add more
disclosures to financial statements. There is a public private
partnership accounting that will be coming to completion in
2016 and a new standard, GASB 75, will come into play in
2018 related to post employment benefit plans.

6.G

effective interest rate is set at 7%. Drafts of these documents
are in the Board Office for review.

Director Lubow noted that in the Board packet there was
something said about the 2004 vote which authorized a debt
of $3.74 billion and a maximum total repayment cost of $7.1
billion. She wondered if these bonds getting us closer to those
maximums. Heather Copp said yes. Assuming the bonds go
up to the $200 million dollar in principal listed as the not to
exceed number, there will be approximately $100 million
dollars in principal left on those FasTracks bonds. However,
with interest rates it could be a little more or a little less.
Director Lubow expressed concern as an unfunded corridor is
in her District. She stated if RTD issues these bonds it leaves
nothing left for the unfunded corridors.
Director Lubow asked for further information about refinancing
if it is economically feasible. She said it was her understanding
if we refinance the repayment of debt will be extended 10
years past the original date. Heather Copp indicated that at
this point in time staff would not know, but the statute
indicates that any refunding cannot exceed 15 years past the
original due date. Brenden Morgan added that historically
when there have been refinancings the debt will be structured
with similar, if not identical, maturity payments. Heather
Copp reiterated staff does not know if the bonds will be
refinanced but this allows staff the flexibility if it does make
financial sense at a later date.
Director Lubow stated she would be voting in favor for this
but has reservations about leaving so little in the FasTracks
pot.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 24, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Heather Copp clarified that in addition to funding for the
Southeast Corridor, this will also complete financing for the
rest of Eagle, North Metro and I-225 projects. Although those
projects are underway, they have not been fully funded.

Director Francone asked for confirmation that the resolution
would allow for the potential refinancing of certain bonds but
that staff did not plan to refinance at this time. Brenden
Morgan indicated that the two main items authorized under
the resolution are: raising new capital for projects, up to $200
million dollars, and refinancing of the 2010A and 2012A
FasTracks bonds. This action item is allowing staff flexibility
to capture a potential opportunity if it becomes available.
Packet Pg. 377

6.G

Committee Chair Menten stated that she would be voting no
for this item. She said while it is great that the community has
contributed so much for the Southeast Rail extension, she is
concerned with our debt load and current projections that this
will risk operations. She stated we might be able to build it,
but if we cannot sustain it, that creates a concern.

Discussion:

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 24, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Heather Copp added that the reason that these two bonds
were combined under one action is because the market is
moving quickly. If staff had to bring this back to another
meeting the opportunity could be missed because the market
is constantly changing.

Brenden Morgan indicated that this resolution is a
reimbursement resolution very similar to one that was done for
the FasTracks bonds two months ago. The resolution
expresses the intent of the Board to be reimbursed from future
financing related to the acquisition of buses. The Strategic
Budget Plan (SBP), as approved by the Board in 2015,
anticipates that the financing of buses. He indicated the fleet
is constantly being refreshed as buses age. Some of the
vehicles identified in the SBP will begin to arrive this month.
The financing for these vehicles will be done in the future, but

• Salaried Employee Trustee Replacement
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors approve the attached Resolution No. ______ amending
the Salaried Employee Defined Benefit (i.e., Pension) Plan and Salaried
Employee Defined Contribution Plan to provide for appointment of the same
four employee trustees for each of the plans, with two trustees being
employee participants in the Pension Plan, and two being employee
participants in the Defined Contribution Plan. The resolution further provides
that the three existing employee trustees serving both plans remain as
trustees with revised termination dates to assure continued staggered terms,
and that a fourth employee be appointed to replace retired trustee Marla
Lien.

Director Hoy asked if we are paying for the buses out of our
normal operating cash which would then be reimbursed by
future loans for that equipment. Brenden Morgan stated that
was correct.

Heather Copp reminded the Board that there are two salaried
plans. One is the Employee Defined Benefit Plan, known as
the Pension Plan, which was closed in January 2008 to new
salaried employees. The new plan is the Salaried Employees
Defined Contribution Plan. There are seven trusties for each
plan, and they are the same trusties. Previously, the trustee
compilation has been two Board Members, the CFO, and four
other trusties. Up until this time it has been two senior
AGM’s, and two middle managers. The trustees decided there

Director Francone asked when the appointment for the
vacancy will be filled. Heather Copp indicated that as soon as
the Board approves the resolution, an announcement will be
made to employees to ask for applications. Director Francone
inquired if the committee makes the final decision on the
replacement, or will Chair Tobiassen. Heather Copp noted
that the Chair of the Board, the Chair of the Trust and the
Chair of the Financial Administration and Audit Committee
make the decision.
Committee Chair Menten noted that this update makes the
trusteeship much more inclusive. She thanked staff for
bringing this forward.

C. Updates

• General Manager Contract Review
Cheryl Wallace of RubinBrown, LLP (RubinBrown), reported to the Board that
RubinBrown was engaged to review the terms of the GM contract that was
just signed. RubinBrown reviewed the terms to look at the annual cost of
the contract and verified that those amounts were in accordance with the
contract terms. RubinBrown will come back annually to report to the Board
what the actual incurred costs were for the District and we will compare
that to the projected costs of the GM contract. One item to point out to the
Board that is different from the previous GM contract is that in prior years,
the GM participated in the Defined Contribution Plan. In this contract the
GM is only participating in the Defined Benefit Plan.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 24, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

should be a different representation to include two members
from the Pension Plan and two members from the Defined
Contribution Plan. The current trusties are: Director Lubow,
Chair Tobiassen, Scott Reed, Lou Ha, Sylvia Francis and
Heather Copp. She said the trustees have been working with
Steve Weinstein, the attorney for both plans. Mr. Weinstein
agrees with the changes as presented as do the current
trustees.

• March 2016 Monthly Financial Status Report
Packet Pg. 380

6.G

Doug MacLeod reiterated that these are the March results, so the first quarter
of the fiscal year. All of the indicators are red when compared to the budget.
For the first quarter, sales and use tax is under budget by 5.6%, ridership is
under budget 3.7%, and fare revenue is under budget 11.6%. Ridership
continues to not only be under budget but under where we were last year by
4.4%. For fare revenue, year-to-date we are $3.9 million under budget.
Staff has been watching fare revenue and sales and use taxes closely
because those figures are used in the SBP and the amended budget. Staff
will be keeping close tabs on the new fare structure to see how that
progresses throughout the year. To date, the $11.3 million shortfall was
caused by lower ridership, lower fare revenue and lower sales and use taxes.
Staff anticipates that we will be at a $32-43 million shortfall by the end of
the year.
Director Bagley indicated that given the unpleasant situation with lower fare
and sales and use tax revenues, staff ought to be looking at where we are
going to adjust and make potential cuts in our budget for this year. Director
Bagley asked if staff had looked into initiating a thoughtful review of how we
are going to adjust that moving forward. General Manager Genova noted
that staff started that process in January. He said there is a plan going
forward with the amended budget to include some significant adjustments.
Director Lubow asked if staff knew why the projected sales and use tax and
fare revenue were so different from reality. Heather Copp reminded the Board
that the recent Colorado School of Leeds presentation included some of their
reasoning for it. She stated their below trend forecast is what we are
actually seeing. She believes some of the factors are the softening economy,
the GDP not growing as expected, uncertainty with the current political
environment, and the daily Federal interest rate discussions. There is a lot of
uncertainty and in just the last few months, consumer spending dropped
dramatically, especially in the area of new and used vehicles.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 24, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Heather Copp stated that sales and use tax was down again. She noted that
staff will be coming to the Board next month with the Amended Budget
where there will be adjustments made to the sales and use tax estimates as
well as Fare Box revenues to account for the changes seen during the first
quarter.

Director Hoy said he has heard mixed comments regarding internet sales and
if RTD will receive sales tax from them. Heather Copp noted that in March
we did receive sales tax from Amazon. She said staff was not expecting it
and neither was the Department of Revenue (DOR); however, even with that,
the sales and use tax revenue is still down. Director Hoy noted since
Amazon is self-reporting that works but if an internet company is not selfreporting RTD will not receive any sales tax. Heather Copp stated that was
cored and explained that the DOR cannot give us the information at a
granular level.
Packet Pg. 381

6.G

Committee Chair Menten noted that in prior years RTD did have to make
some dramatic service cuts. She asked from a historical perspective what
the shortfall was in those years. Heather Copp noted that we cut 7-8% of
service and which equated to $20-$30 million dollars when combined with
other changes including cancelling projects, salary freezes, etc. Heather
Copp stated she does not expect service cuts to be needed as there are
enough projects to defer.
Brenden Morgan noted that this report has been updated to make it easier to
read. The yield for the District’s unrestricted portfolio for the first quarter
was 0.6%, which would produce annual earnings of $1.8 million dollars. He
explained that the graphs included in the report show the investment
performance over time as compared to the benchmark that is set in the
policy. Historically performance has been just above, but in-line with the
benchmark. That trend continues today.

• SBP First Draft
Jannette Scarpino, Senior Manager of Budget and Financial Analysis, noted
that there is a first draft cash flow included in the updated Strategic Budget
Plan (SBP). She reminded the Board that a high level overview of the SBP
was presented in April and tonight staff will discuss the first draft cash flow.
The SBP only includes the base system plan and FasTracks operations
activity. The FasTracks expense and projects are shown separately and
brought to the Board in the Annual Program Evaluation (APE). The SBP
parameters include fiscal management, including requirements to operate per
specified performance measures, and strategic and tactical goals for the GM
while maintaining a balanced budget over a six year period. The SBP also
incorporates building our reserves in both the Board Appropriated Fund and
the Capital Replacement Fund and maintaining our current service levels.
The baseline for the SBP is the 2016 Amended Budget with a fuel lock price
of $2.23/gallon escalated by the national Consumer Price Index. She
indicated capital and expense projects would need to be prioritized as
currently there is a $220 million shortfall

Jannette Scarpino reminded the Board that there are many factors that make
up the SBP, some of which are in staff’s control and some that are not. The
factors include:
Uncontrollable SBP factors –
 Sales/use tax revenue
 Fuel price volatility
 Inflation rate
 Continued nature of economic growth
 Interest rates on debt
 Ridership

The target for the fund balances is $100 million which represents three
months of operating expenses. For the 2017-2022 SBP Revenue
Assumptions, the next fare increases should occur in 2019 and 2022. The
March 2016 forecast from CU Leeds will be used for sales and use tax
assumptions. Federal Grants are assumed to increase at the rate of inflation
or as identified in the grant parameters. For expenditures, operating and
maintenance costs are inflated based on the CPI, fuel cost is budget at the
2016 lock and escalated at the CPI and capital expenses are prioritized based
on a scoring methodology.
Jannette Scarpino outlined the next steps as follows:
 June 14 – Board adoption of the 2016 Amended Budget and
2017-2022 SBP Update
 July 12 – 2017-2022 SBP Update
 August 9 – Presentation of final 2017-2022 SBP to the
Financial Administration and Audit Committee
 August 16 – Board adoption of 2017-2022 SBP
 August 23 – 2017 Budget Study Session
Heather Copp explained that staff was delaying approval of the SBP so the
Board could see it together with the FasTracks APE. She noted in the current
SBP the fund balances do not reach $100 million until 2022, which had been
something discussed during the Board/Senior Leadership advance as a priority
to reach sooner.
Director Lubow asked how staff would characterize in the current financial
situation. She pointed out that RTD is seeing revenues below projections but
her impression is the economy is okay. Heather Copp indicated Director
Lubow summarized the situation very well. The economy is doing fine and
there is stable growth rate but not as exponentially as was seen after the
recent recession. She stated that RTD is not near a crisis situation, we just
need to be reasonable about spending and prioritize the most important
expenses. There was a long period of time when projects were deferred so
there are a lot of areas that need to be addressed. She emphasized that
revenues are still growing at very good rates of 4-5%, but not the rates of 79% that was happening after the recession. Director Lubow asked if this
was a situation where we should be spending down some of our reserves.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 24, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

 Grant revenue/Federal Appropriations
The areas that we can control are –
 Fare rate increases/decreases
 Service levels
 Operating costs/expense projects
 Capital investment in projects
 Fund balance development

Heather Copp stated no; staff just needs to be conservative and cut down on
expenditures and operating costs. General Manager Genova added that he
cannot remember a year since he has been here there were no deferred
projects.

General Manager Genova added that as staff looks at that prioritization,
information from asset management will be used to help focus on maintaining
our State of Good Repair.

• Smart Media Technology (SMT)
Heather Copp introduced Tonya Anderson as the new Manager of Electronic
Fare Operations and asked her to provide the Board with her background.
Tonya Anderson noted that she has worked on the Smart Card project for 4
years. She brings a lot of insight and history on the program. She was
previously an Officer in the United States the Air Force as an IT project
manager.
Tonya Anderson pointed out that may of the status indicators continue to be
yellow due to an accelerated timeline for the project elements; however, the
project is benefitting from an improved relationship with our vendor, Xerox.
They are stepping up and helping the team meet the project deadlines. There
are no roadblocks preventing the team from meeting the goal to launch the
MyRide web portal on June 30th.
Tonya Anderson noted that for the merchant retail point of sales program,
staff has been in active discussions with King Soopers and very recently
began discussions with Albertson’s. Both are very excited to participate and
key stores have been selected at Denver Metro King Soopers for testing. She
said it was very encouraging progress.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 24, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Hoy noted that some people may recall that when Don Hunt took
over CDOT he had money set aside for bridge repair, a highway
improvement, etc., but not enough to complete any one project. He
wondered if it was correct to say that RTD is in a similar situation. Heather
Copp explained that staff is looking at projects to prioritize what gets done.

Tonya Anderson pointed out that the handheld readers have changed from
green to yellow since the last update. There have been challenges with the
implementation of the software, but that was resolved within the last week so
the team is proceeding forward. The devices should be distributed for testing
and field training soon.
Director Folska asked when is the anticipated date for going live with the
entire Smart Media program. Tonya Anderson indicated that the web portal
element will be live on June 30th. Staff is working diligently to complete the
rest of the project by the end of the year.
Packet Pg. 384

Chair Tobiassen noted that 1500 cards over 17 weeks seems like a very small
number. He asked if we were no longer promoting the pilot. Heather Copp
indicated that there are another 219 vouchers that will be mailed this week
but will be slowing down the launch of the web portal approaches on June
30th. She said there was not as much interest as staff was originally hoping.

• Real Time Passenger Information Demo
Rahul Sood, Manager of Software Architecture and Development, reviewed a
Power Point Presentation with the Board that is included in the May 24,
2016 Financial Administration and Audit Committee Agenda Packet. He
explained that the project was started about a year and a half ago and realtime information for bus service is now available to the public through
Google, Transit App and ezRide. The goal of real-time information is to
reduce frustration and increase customer satisfaction. Eventually, the
information will be available on the RTD website as well as the information
display signs at the stations. Staff hopes to have information for Light and
Commuter rail available by the end of the year.
Director Folska asked if the disabled communities were engaged during
testing. She suggested reaching out to the National Federation for the Blind,
CCDC and so forth. Rahul Sood said that right now the real-time information
was only published by third parties. He added that for the work we are doing
for our Next Ride application, Communications is working with that
community

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 24, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Committee Chair Menten noted that the officers had a lot of complaints about
the handheld readers and this needs a lot of testing. She wondered how long
there was technical support from the vendor. Eric Farrington, IT Program
Manager, indicated that we have one year software support from Xerox from
the date of acceptance, which has not yet been done. The iPhones were
purchased from a different vendor and we have one year of support for those
as well. Committee Chair Menten asked if the equipment would only be the
iPhones or if there was another component. Eric Farrington said there are two
pieces of equipment: the iPhone and the scanner.

Director Folska noted that instead of tools for playing games while people
wait for their bus or train the apps should send people to Amazon. Rahul
Sood explained that the trend is going that way. There are options based on
location for dining or shopping.
Director Anderson questioned if the app provided options when a service is
unavailable, such as the recent University of Colorado A-Line shutdown.
Rahul Sood explained that the University of Colorado A-Line does not have
real time data yet; however, the apps will offer different route options and
indicate if a service is delayed.
Packet Pg. 385

General Manager Genova added that staff wanted to give the Board a
snapshot on the different transit apps available to the public. He said every
week our data seems to be picked up by a new 3rd party.
Committee Chair Menten asked if the MyStop numbers can be added to
Google Maps. Rahul Sood explained that Google already has that
information.

There were no other matters.

Director Hoy shared that he was sitting on Colfax one day for lunch and
opened Transit App. He did not see the buses show up on the app that he
saw driving by. He wondered what might be the cause. Rahul Sood
explained that at that time, the information was published every 20 seconds
so there might have been a delay in receiving accurate information. Since
that time the information is now updated every 5 seconds.

B. Recommended Actions

• Authorization to Enter into a Contract with Motorola Solutions for Purchase
of Radios (56DH012)
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that
the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to
enter into a $940,000 sole source contract with Motorola
Solutions(Motorola) for purchase of mobile, portable and tower radios and
associated equipment (Contract Number 56DH012). This contract will
include an option for a 3-year extended warranty.
Motion:

Director Bagley made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the May 31, 2016
Board Meeting.
Director Folska seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Terry Emmons, Assistant General Manager of Rail Operations,
indicated this request is for additional radios for security
personnel and operators on light rail vehicles and associated
equipment.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 24, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Directors Deadwyler, Lasater and Sisk were absent.

Chair Tobiassen inquired as to the life expectancy of the
radios. He wondered if these were to replace some of the
radios originally purchased or if these were to supplement
those radios. Eric Farrington, IT Program Manager, indicated
these were in addition to the originally purchased radios.
These radios have a life expectancy of 15 years and many are

lasting 20 or longer. He stated the original radios are still
going strong.

• Parking Management Extended to New Facilities
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that
the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to include new parking
facilities in the Parking Management Program.
Motion:

Chair Tobiassen made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the May 31, 2016
Board Meeting.
Director Bagley seconded the motion.

Motion to
Postpone to
a Time
Certain:
Chair Tobiassen made the motion to postpone
this item until the August 9, 2016 Operations
and Customer Service Committee Meeting.
Director Walker seconded the motion. Director
Walker later withdrew his second and Director
Folska seconded the motion.
Discussion:

Chair Tobiassen explained that the Parking Management
Program (Program) was adopted by the Board in 2008, which
was quite some time ago. There has been a great deal of
progress since then on the FasTracks program. He stated this
is a new world with new parking opportunities. Additionally,
the State Legislature has also changed RTD’s ability to partner
as it relates to parking. Chair Tobiassen thinks this is the time
to evaluate the Program and make it more inclusive in terms of
how RTD works with other jurisdictions as it relates to
parking.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 24, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Committee Chair Anderson declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

Packet Pg. 389

6.H

Director Folska thanked Chair Tobiassen for taking the
initiative to postpone this recommendation until August. She
does not think it is at all ready for primetime so she will be
supporting the motion.
Director Hoy noted the irony in this item being on the agenda
tonight as he was still wearing his steel toed boots from an
earlier tour at the Westminster Station, including the new
parking structure. He does not know if anyone has talked to
Westminster or if Westminster has any plans but he thinks it
would be a good idea to at least have a discussion with them.
Chair Tobiassen commented that there is a similar situation in
Aurora where RTD and Aurora partnered to build the parking
garage at Iliff Station. He stated the negotiations related to
managing that structure and parking around the station were
still ongoing. He reiterated that postponing this item gives
RTD a chance to step back and make sure input from other
jurisdictions is included in the Program. He pointed out that
there is also a parking study in-progress that the Board should
be seeing soon and believes it is important to have this
information before moving forward.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 24, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Menten recognized that Chair Tobiassen gave a high
level explanation for his reasons for wanting to postpone this
item but asked for specifics. Committee Chair Anderson
reminded the Board that the City of Arvada has invested $30
million into the parking structure at the Olde Town station.
She would like to see RTD work with our partners that are
making these huge investments in our parking structures to
come up with a more up-to-date Parking Management Program
rather than use something from 2008 that did not anticipate
these scenarios. She hopes there can be a more inclusive
process.

General Manager Genova indicated staff would be bringing the
initial report from the parking study analysis to the Board in
July. He said staff would not be asking the Board to take any
action but would be reviewing the findings and information to
consider as the parking dialog continues.
General Manager Genova stated that with regards to the Olde
Town Arvada, Westminster, Iliff and Boulder Junction at
Depot Square stations, staff has had very specific
conversations with those parties. He clarified that this action
would have no impact on parking facilities where RTD has an
Packet Pg. 390

6.H

Chair Tobiassen reiterated that there is an opportunity to look
at the parking study in conjunction with the Parking
Management Program to evaluate what really make sense and
ensure our jurisdictions understand how RTD does business
from a parking perspective.
Director Menten expressed concern that RTD would be giving
up revenue by holding off on this action as the garages
mentioned by other Directors would not be affected. General
Manager Genova explained that RTD currently charges for
parking at the Central Park and 40th and Pena stations along
the University of Colorado A-Line and stated that Director
Menten was correct that we would be giving up revenue at
the other stations along that line. The recommendation to
include the new parking facilities in the Parking Management
Program would not include facilities for which there was
already an IGA in place such as the Iliff and Westminster
stations. He indicated that staff is currently having ongoing
conversations/negotiations with the respective municipalities
about how those facilities would be managed.
Errol Stevens, Parking Management Administrator, pointed out
that a 90 day notice must be posted prior to charging for
parking, which has been done along the University of Colorado
A-Line facilities. He said this means RTD could begin charging
for parking at the remaining University of Colorado A-Line
Park-n-Rides beginning July 25, 2016. He believes RTD would
capture more revenue as staff is seeing more travelers on that
line. Director Menten stated she would prefer to get the
additional revenue and people into the groove if it will not
affect the stations other Directors were concerned about.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 24, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

agreement or Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with a
municipality. He explained this action would allow RTD to
move forward with the current Parking Management Program
on the new corridors, particularly the University of Colorado ALine. He thinks there is a great opportunity for increased
revenue as staff anticipates parking along that line to increase.
He stated delaying approval until August would delay
implementation as he cannot authorize the vendor to undergo
installation of necessary equipment without Board approval.
He believes it will take approximately 30 to 60 days to
implement after approval.

Robin McIntosh, Senior Manager of Facilities, apologized for
not providing the Board with the option to just approve adding
Packet Pg. 391

6.H

Rolf Asphaug, Acting General Council, suggested that the
Board could defeat the motion to postpone and then move to
amend the pending motion to narrow it down or change the
wording to allow certain stations to be excluded. Committee
Chair Anderson agreed that sounded like a fairly good plan and
asked Chair Tobiassen and Director Walker how they wanted
to proceed.
Chair Tobiassen stated he preferred to move forward with
postponing the item. He understands the negotiations with
Aurora are not going well and the IGA is up in the air, to put it
mildly, which he finds disturbing. He explained that is his
reason behind wanting to ensure the Parking Management
Program is really evaluated. He stated with the situation on
the University of Colorado A-Line over the past few days it
might not be bad to delay charging until things are stabilized
and operating consistently.
Director Hoy asked if his understanding was correct that
regardless of tonight’s decision, the Westminster station
would be independent of the Parking Management Program
and thus not be affected either positively or negatively. Robin
McIntosh stated that was correct.
Director Bagley pointed out that parking is the elephant in the
room, for the entire District. He stated parking is a very
critical issue. He believes RTD needs to start setting
parameters about how we deal with parking management so it
is not one-off situations all the time.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 24, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

the Park-n-Rides along the University of Colorado A-Line. He
explained staff’s intent had been to approve adding all the
facilities so they did not have to bother the Board on a
continuing basis as new lines opened.

Director Walker wondered if there would be anything
precluding another jurisdiction from approaching RTD about
entering into an IGA if the staff recommendation was passed
this evening. General Manager Genova indicated an
agreement could be entered into with a municipality,
jurisdiction, etc. should we want to do something differently.
Committee Chair Anderson stated her objection is that this is a
policy from 2008. She said she has been hearing from cities
that say the program is not working and there is no
negotiating. She believes with more time it would be possible
Packet Pg. 392

6.H

to come up with a good plan. She agrees with Director
Menten’s concern about losing revenue but it is only a period
of a few months.

Henry Stopplecamp noted that there were really two issues on
the table: locations where RTD owns the property completely
and sites where we have teamed up with other local
municipalities and have an IGA. He stated locations where
there is an IGA are really different than RTD surface Park-nRides. He explained the intent of staff’s recommendation was
to cover anything not already covered through an IGA. He
said staff is more than happy to work with the various
municipalities going forward.
Errol Stevens said his sense is if the four facilities of concern
could be disconnected from the other new parking facilities
staff’s recommendation could advance; however, a
postponement would tie up both items as it stands now. He
questioned if the Board could find a way to separate the two
issues to approve the Parking Management Program for those
facilities that are solely owned and operated by RTD.
Director James thinks the idea of segmenting the two issues is
interesting. He wondered if passing staff’s recommendation
this evening would preclude the Board from making future
changes based on the results of the parking study. Errol
Stevens explained this action just established what facilities
were including the Parking Management Program; if the Board
voted to approve a new program these facilities would then be
covered by that program.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 24, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Lubow wondered if it would be possible to just deal
with the University of Colorado A-Line and allow for a more
thorough discussion on the other lines to continue. She thinks
it would be good to do something that will generate revenue
while still allowing the Board to look at the broader issues.
Henry Stopplecamp stated it would be possible to make an
amendment to the original motion.

General Manager Genova reminded the Board that staff moved
forward with a parking study due to an unsolicited proposal
that was received related to monetizing parking District-wide.
It was determined the proposal had merit but there were many
questions surrounding the concept. He explained that even if
the Board wanted to move forward with a different program
down the road the facilities covered by IGAs would still have
Packet Pg. 393

6.H

Director James asked if staff had an estimate as to how much
revenue would be generated from the additional University of
Colorado A-Line facilities. Errol Stevens stated it would be
difficult to provide a figure with all the changes in travel
patterns with the opening of the line. He said overall the
program produces $1.3 million in gross revenue per year so he
does not anticipate it will be a large figure.
Director James indicated he would vote against the motion to
postpone.
Director Walker commented that the reason several Directors
want to postpone the recommendation is to give our partners
more time to evaluate the program. He indicated after hearing
more from staff and the fact that the facilities of concern will
not be included, he is going to withdraw his second. He
believes there is the opportunity for discussion but will provide
some revenue and stability for the University of Colorado ALine.
Director Folska stated she would second the motion to
postpone this recommendation to a date certain.
Director Folska said she had similar concerns to those
expressed by other Directors. She feels that the current
Program is just patchwork. There is not a program that is
clear and ubiquitous for the entire District. She believes effort
should be put into doing something thoughtful and consistent.
Director Folska also thinks there are bigger fish to fry like why
the University of Colorado A-Line is not working like it should.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 24, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

to be bifurcated out of the new program. He said another item
to consider is how to deal with the contract currently in place
with our Parking Management provider that is good through
2018. If the Board were to fundamentally change how the
program is managed we would have to negotiate closing out
our contract with the provider.

Director Lubow noted that whether the Board approved the
recommendation this evening or not, staff understands that
they need to go forward and do a thorough review of the
current Program. She does not want RTD to lose revenue
which is why she will vote against postponing; however, she
reiterated that it is important to continue to have discussions
about where parking is going.
Packet Pg. 394

Committee Chair Anderson expressed that in reading the
recommendation she did not feel it exempted anything. She
does not think staff has listened to our partners so she will be
voting in favor of postponing.

• 2016 Title VI Program Update
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that
the Board of Directors adopt the 2016 Title VI Program Update to comply
with federal laws, regulations and guidelines related to Title VI of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964.
Motion:

Director Solano made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the May 31, 2016
Board Meeting.
Director Walker seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager of Planning,
introduced Michael Washington, Title VI Manager, and Shontel
Lewis, Title VI Specialist, who reviewed a Power Point
presentation that is included in the May 24, 2016 Operations
and Customer Service Committee Agenda Packet.
Michael Washington reminded the Board that a Title VI
Program Update must be submitted to the Federal Transit
Administration every three years as a condition of federal
financial assistance. He said that as the Board was probably
aware, Title VI prohibits discrimination on the basis of race,
color and national origin. The FTA prescribes the following
measures to guide recipients of federal funds in the promotion
of socially equitable transit:
 Equity Analyses
 System-Wide Service Standards and Policies
 Service Monitoring

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 24, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Rolf Asphaug pointed out that since there were 12 Directors
at the meeting the motion to postpone to a time certain would
require 7 in favor to pass.

 Public Engagement

Shontel Lewis outlined the philosophy related to public
engagement as follows:
 Meet the Community Where They Are
 Identify Generalizable Concerns
 Build Rapport with the Community
 Partner with the Community
She explained as part of the process the environmental justice
communities first had to be identified. These are communities
within the affected area that have an above average
proportion of minority and low-income households.
Shontel Lewis noted there were many challenges during the
public engagement process such as circulation of
misinformation, trust and transparency. Staff’s goals were to
illustrate the benefits of the service changes, remediate
misunderstandings and listen to community concerns. She
said there were four strategies used during the public
engagement process which included having volunteers ride
routes within the effected communities, having tables and
volunteers at Park-n-Rides and bus stops, driver outreach, and
public meetings called “Know Your Routes”.
Shontel Lewis stated this was really a great opportunity to
engage with the community. The team made contact with
over 1,000 riders who really appreciated the efforts made by
RTD.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 24, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Michael Washington explained that an equity analyses must
take place for any fare changes as well as any major service
changes and all new openings. He noted that public
engagement was a very important part of the process. He
asked Shontel Lewis to review the recent public engagement
process during the equity analyses for the University of
Colorado A-Line Service Changes.

Michael Washington highlighted the importance of
understanding the level of effort that went into making sure
our riders would not be negatively impacted by the large
amount of changes that were happening with the University of
Colorado A-Line opening. It was incredibly important to make
sure everyone was aware of the changes and how to take
advantage of them.

Committee Chair Anderson declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

• August 2016 Service Change Final
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that
the Board of Directors approve the August 2016 Service Change package as
revised and summarized in Attachment A resulting in an annualized cost of
approximately $1,085,400 and, further, to authorize the General Manager or
his designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private
operators whose service is impacted by these changes.
Motion:

Director Bagley made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the May 31, 2016
Board Meeting.
Director Folska seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations,
shared with the Board that staff received a letter from
Commerce City requesting that Route 62 be removed from the
August Service Changes. He explained that originally this
route was to be funded through a grant received by Commerce
City; however, there was supposed to be a new roadway
constructed for the route that is not yet complete. Bruce Abel
said per Commerce City’s request staff was asking for an
amendment to remove Route 62 from the August Service
Changes.
Motion to
Amend:

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 24, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Francone thanked the team for doing such a good job.
She requested an electronic copy of the full update that would
be submitted to the FTA. Michael Washington said he would
make it available.

Director Solano made the motion to remove
Route 62 from the August Service Changes.
Director Folska seconded a motion.

Discussion:

Jessie Carter, Manager of Service Planning and Scheduling,
reminded the Board that in August there is the
reimplementation of school service, which accounts for a
majority of the changes. He noted the increase in service of
the Free Metro Ride but pointed out this was entirely funded
through a Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement
Grant. He explained that August Service Changes will now
have an annualized cost of approximately $549,600 versus
$1,085,400 when Route 62 was included.
Chair Tobiassen stated there were several minor service
changes along Route 43 that were needed in his District
related to bus stop placement. Jessie Carter explained this is
something that staff is working on but per new Federal Transit
Administration Guidelines all new bus stops must be 100%
ADA compliant. Bruce Abel shared that staff would be
briefing the Board on these changes next month with more
detail as staff is evaluating how they impact our operations.
Director Francone asked staff to speak to the proposed Route
CV/CS/CX. She wondered if it negatively affected any riders.
Jessie Carter explained that the proposal is to convert the last
Route CV trip to a Route CS trip so it also served the Federal
Center Station. He said there were four people that provided
comments and believe it would be better to add a trip than
convert the last trip. He noted adding a trip would cost money
so at this time staff is standing with the current proposal. He
stated the four people that provided comments believe this
negatively impacts them.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 24, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Rolf Asphaug indicated the Board could approve this
amendment via a unanimous voice vote. Hearing no
objections, Committee Chair Anderson declared the
amendment passed.

Director Francone wondered if the Lockheed Martin Call-n-Ride
was still operating or if it has been folded into the South
Jeffco Call-n-Ride service. Bruce Abel stated there were no
recommendations at this time to eliminate the Lockheed
Martin service. Director Francone said it would be interesting
to see if ridership has been improving. Bruce Abel commented
that ridership has not improved and the service is currently
under review.
Director Hoy asked for clarification about the differences
between Route 72 and 72W. Jessie Carter explained that
Packet Pg. 398

Route 72W goes to Westminster High School while Route 72
ties into the B-Line at the Westminster Station.

C. Updates

 University of Colorado A Line Update (no back-up)
Bruce Abel explained that staff wanted to provide a brief update on ridership
numbers after the first four weeks of operations on the University of
Colorado A-Line. He said ridership averages were 15,860 for the first week,
16,900 for the second week, 17,640 for the third week and 16,700 for the
fourth week. He shared that ridership data has been gathered from the
automatic passenger counters that were installed on all commuter rail
vehicles.

• RTD Commuter Rail Oversight
Terry Emmons, Assistant General Manager of Rail Operations, introduced
Walt Stringer, Senior Manager of Commuter Rail, Henry Stopplecamp,
Acting Assistant General Manager of Capital Programs, and Greg Straight,
Engineering Project Manager. He asked Walt Stringer to review the Power
Point presentation that was included in the May 24, 2016 Operations and
Customer Service Committee Agenda Packet.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 24, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Hoy also asked for further information about Route 31
as he found the explanation confusing. Jessie Carter
explained that staff would be using an interline change to
provide a trip further north at no cost.

Walt Stringer explained that since service began on the University of
Colorado A-Line, staff wanted to ensure the Board understood how RTD
oversees Denver Transit Partners (DTP) and the commuter rail performance,
the metrics that must be met, and the invoice process. He said RTD staff
utilizes a comprehensive Oversight Plan with Concession Agreement (CA)
specific forms to record observations. He stated that Availability Payments
are pre-set payments outlined by the Concession Agreement that may
include a performance adjustment if certain metrics are not met. Invoices
are submitted by DTP that capture all required performance elements. These

Packet Pg. 399

6.H

invoices are then reviewed by RTD staff to confirm accuracy of the
information submitted by DTP versus the observations made by RTD staff.

Chair Tobiassen asked staff for an update on current operations of the
University of Colorado A-Line and the recent issues. General Manager
Genova stated during the first few weeks of operations on-time performance
was very good averaging above 95%. He said the first major problem
occurred last Monday when power was lost to a train resulting in passengers
being stuck on the train for a very long time. Subsequently the University of
Colorado A-Line has been experiencing a number of power outages that
have been traumatic for our passengers, especially if they are stuck on a
train. General Manager Genova indicated the most recent issue happened
this afternoon with a train getting stuck on the bridge over Peña Boulevard
resulting in the ultimate evacuation of the train.
General Manager Genova explained that while the team was able to
determine the cause of most of the power outages, there are still some that
the reason has not been determined which is concerning. He recognized
Aaron Epstein and John Thompson from DTP who were here this evening to
answer any questions. He shared that RTD and DTP staff have regular
meetings regarding operations. He also has a monthly call with the DTP
Board of Directors, which he just had this morning. He indicated he was
able to have a very frank conversation with the Board discussing the
incidents of the past week. He said he made it very clear that this is not
satisfactory to RTD but recognized it is not satisfactory for DTP either.
General Manager Genova shared he asked the DTP Board what they planned
to do for the patrons that missed flights. They are working diligently to
provide safe, reliable service. He stated no one was taking these issues
lightly and everyone was concerned.
Director Folska feels bewildered that there are these types of problems after
the extensive testing that was done. She wonders what has changed from
when testing was occurring to cause the current events to happen. General
Manager Genova stated that to his knowledge there were no power issues
during testing and training so everyone was very surprised when this
became an issue last week. He explained whenever there was an issue the
team looked at everting to drill down to the root cause. He shared that the
cause of each power outage has been different so there was not a specific
issue that could be identified as the problem. Today a messenger wire
broke, impacting power along the entire line until the issue was isolated.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 24, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Lubow inquired if RTD or DTP was responsible for collection of
fares. Walt Stringer stated RTD provides the Ticket Vending Machines and
fare collection is RTD’s responsibility.

Packet Pg. 400

6.H

Terry Emmons noted that just because this is a new line it does not mean it
is perfect. He has dealt with several openings and there are always nuances
and issues that must be addressed.

Henry Stopplecamp commented this was not an issue of a “black swan” but
the process that happens when new service begins. The service starts small
and gets expanded as there are lessons learned. He said there had been
issues over the 22 years light rail had been in operations but staff dealt with
them. He shared that last Monday the power outage was due to a phase
break issue that has already been resolved in a way so that it physically
cannot happen again at that section. He stated unfortunately things happen
but the question is how quickly staff can respond to an issue.
Director Lubow said it seems like issues are happening in an order of
magnitude more than we should be experiencing. Henry Stopplecamp
pointed out that the trains had been running since November and last week
is the first time there was a loss of power.
Greg Straight emphasized that the project team is not making excuses. No
one involved finds recent performance acceptable. The entire team is doing
everything to get service to the level expected based on existing light rail.
He said generally the issues have been one-off type issues that are quickly
identified, fixed, tested and then perform stably. He stated that it is not a
scenario where the same issue is happening repeatedly.
Director Menten asked staff to compile information on how many times the
University of Colorado A-Line has broken down, how long those instances
were in duration and if it required an evacuation. She stated she needs to
be prepared with this information when she is asked questions from the
public. General Manager Genova said he would send a write-up to the entire
Board.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 24, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Lubow stated this seems to be an anomaly or “black swan” that
engineers did not predict being an issue. She wonders what we do in this
situation. She asked if buses are standing by to pick people up if there are
problems. General Manager Genova stated that just like on light rail, if there
is a service interruption that staff expects to be for a significant period of
time a bus bridge is put in place.

Director Menten noted General Manager Genova mentioned asking DTP what
they planned to do for people that missed flights but did not recall hearing
their response. She said it is one thing to give someone $9 back but what
about their flight costs. General Manager Genova stated for those patrons
contacting RTD we are giving them a free ride coupon or refund of their fare;
however, it has not been RTD’s policy to make larger reimbursements and
Packet Pg. 401

6.H

Director Bagley reiterated that while we have had light rail for 22 years it
was done very incrementally. There has never been commuter rail in Denver
and commuter rail has not yet been operated during the spring. He
suggested that perhaps the spring thunder storms over the last week could
be the issue. He stated that stuff happens and we address it. If a burned
out wire caused an issue this week then we need to figure out what to do
so it does not happen again. He said he is very satisfied with where RTD
and DTP are going. He commented that when something is developed that
is so technologically complex you cannot expect that nothing will ever
happen. He thanked everyone for all their efforts.
Chair Tobiassen concurred with Director Bagley. He thinks it is important for
the Board to keep an eye on recurring events and have good answers for
constituents. He appreciates everyone’s hard work. He asked for daily
updates that included details so the Board could stay informed. Chair
Tobiassen also requested information on the cybersecurity of the system.
Director James thanked DTP for being present and recognized that it was a
challenging time. He suggested in the short term staff prepare something
that quickly describes what happened so the Board is prepared to speak with
the public. In the longer term he would appreciate something in-depth about
what happened. He asked if this in-depth document could also outline what
the consequences to DTP’s payment would be, if any, as being helpful to
put everything in perspective. He also asked staff to prepare an update on
the at-grade crossings. General Manager Genova indicated staff would
prepare the information.
Director Hoy thought it would be good to receive information on the status
of the at-grade crossings as well because it is a real issue. He shared that
he recently took a radio personality on a trip along the University of Colorado
A-Line and it took about an hour to get to DIA. On the return trip the
gentleman timed it and the train was within 10 seconds of 37 minutes. As
to the reports on issues that are occurring, he asked staff to be sure and
indicate if something is a repeat of a previous or similar failure. He believes
it is important for the Board to know if there is something that keeps
breaking.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 24, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

he does not plan to do so now. He said DTP’s Board asked if they could put
some thought into their response and get back to us.

Director Hoy inquired if he was correct that the B-Line is powered from the
same power source as the University of Colorado A-Line. He wonders if it
an accurate assumption that if the University of Colorado A-Line goes down
so does the B-Line. Henry Stopplecamp stated all power comes from Xcel
and goes into two substations. He said if one substation goes down the
Packet Pg. 402

6.H

other one should pick up the slack so the B-Line should still have power in
most instances.
Director Hoy pointed out that the B-Line is in testing right now. He asked if
the B-Line was still able to operate around the time of the University of
Colorado A-Line power failure. Arron Epstein stated he did not know what
operations were actually running at that time but knows they would be able
to run it.

Committee Chair Anderson thanked everyone for their time this evening.
She recognized that everyone wants the same thing which is a robust transit
system that works 100% pf the time. She acknowledged it has been a
tough week but everyone is working together.
Henry Stopplecamp stated it was a fantastic team from rail operations to
construction to engineering to finance. He said everyone wants the
University of Colorado A-Line to run well. The entire team is very dedicated.

• Lost Service Hours and Hiring Update
Bruce Abel indicated the Lost Service Hours and Hiring Update reports were
included in the May 25, 2016 Operations and Customer Service Committee
Agenda Packet. He highlighted that the lost hours of service was down to
178 hours for April as compared to 800-900 hours over the winter. He
believes they are making progress and noted that forced overtime was
beginning to be reduced.

D. Other Matters
Director Bagley shared he attended the APTA Bus and Paratransit Conference Last
week. He said the conference was very informative with great presentations. He
had the opportunity to see the Gillig and MCI buses and interact with the people
that build them. He attended an outstanding Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) presentation
that related to BRT across the country. He encouraged his fellow Board members
to attend these types of conferences as it is a great learning opportunity.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 24, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Hoy asked for a more in-depth review of the Concession Agreement
invoice process from staff offline.

Committee Chair Anderson shared that she attended the APTA Transit Board
Member Seminar in San Antonio with Directors Hoy and Walker. She said there
were some excellent sessions on new Board member orientation. She further
commended the RTD Board staff for the great job they do.

Chair Tobiassen moved on to the Unanimous Consent agenda for review and asked if there
were any questions on any of the items being presented. Director Deadwyler asked about
the appointment of the Salaried Employee Trustee Replacement as she needed clarification
on the structure. Chair Tobiassen explained the structure change and how it was
determined to address both of the salaried plans were and that they were equally
represented by an appropriate mix of staff from each specific plan. He went further to say

Packet Pg. 405

6.I

Chair Tobiassen asked to move onto the recommended action agenda and outlined the
items being considered. There was no discussion on the State Liaison Services. Director
Hoy asked about the Item I and wanted to confirm that the corridors listed SE Corridor and
Eagle P3 were the specific corridors listed in the resolution. Currently the GM Genova said
that was true the bonds would be utilized for the stated corridors. The Central corridor
and the SW corridor are not funded at this time.
Director Francone requested a short discussion regarding the ideology of funding the buses
at this time outlined in Resolution J as opposed to waiting to make the purchase and how
the funding would be paid back. GM Genova discussed the challenges of getting on the
schedule of having the buses built and moving forward would insure the delivery of the
vehicles needed when they are needed. Director Francone asked if staff was comfortable
that the bus vendor would be around for a period of time. GM Genova said he feels the
providers we are using now would be around for a while.
Chair Tobiassen moved on to the last recommended action the August 2016 Service
Changes. Director Deadwyler voiced some concern about how the bus constituents have
been lost with all the energy going to the train right now. She has said there are bus
scheduling concerns that need to addressed from April before we move on to additional
changes. GM Genova said he would have Jessie Carter look at some of the adjustments
that need to be made. Director Hoy mentioned that on the BRT routes needed changes in
January after the opening and the service planning group were very proactive in making
adjustments. Director Deadwyler said she would follow up on the problem routes
particularly northern Aurora and service to the Anschutz Campus. Director Francone said
she met with Jessie Carter in the afternoon to clarify the needs of her constituents are
being met. Director Menten and Director Hoy mentioned adjustments were made to the
bus schedules were made after the opening of the West Line and for the most part the
needs were met.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 26, 2016 2:00 PM (Committee Reports)

2 board members represent as well and Heather Copp, CFO, was a standing member of
the committee. Chair Tobiassen said he is impressed with how the fund is managed and
the entire committee is engaged in the process. Chair Tobiassen outlined how the
appointments of the board representation would be completed once he and Director
Lubow rolled off the committee in December. GM Genova said the vacancy for the new
member would be advertised in the Monday Morning Q and applications would be
reviewed for the perspective candidates.

Motion: Director Deadwyler made the motion to
approve moving the May 31st Board agenda to the full
Board.

Other Matters

GM Genova gave an update on the disruption problems on the A Line describing the
phase break problem and what they have done to remediate the problem. All
modifications were completed last evening, May 25th. The incident on Tuesday has
been resolved and a determination was made that a lightning strike caused the
disruption of service. Director Deadwyler asked why we need the phase break at all.
GM Genova said the design was questioned by our team but DTP made the decision
to move forward with the phase break. Director Hoy asked why they thought the
current design would be best. GM Genova noted there would be less maintenance
with the phase break design. Chair Tobiassen asked if we could move on as this is
a conversation we might have with the entire board.
Director Deadwyler said the new rail line openings should utilize external the
ambassadors in their areas. She indicated her constituents who were ambassadors
were very proud to be an honorary RTD employee for a period of time and to be
engaged in the community surrounding the opening of the A Line. She also gave
kudos and a special thank you Jessie Carter and Adrian Mabry for making it all
happen in her district.

6.I

Chair Tobiassen said the search would be internal and external as well as specific
transportation venues would be utilized. Director Menten asked why in the core
competencies it mentioned Collective Bargaining Agreement as no represented
employees were in the board office. It was explained that the competencies are
static and are the same for all salaried employees. Director Francone asked if we
were sure this description was ADA compliant. Chair Tobiassen said he always
encourages all to apply for the positions regardless of challenges. HR gives all the
opportunity for constituents to demonstrate skills. GM Genova said all of the jobs
go through a process to insure we are compliant.
Free Ride Coupon Audit

Chair Tobiassen shared a copy of the audit of the Free Ride Coupons and the current
Management Directive for review. He said he was very surprised at the dollar
amount and the number of these coupons being used by the agency. The
committee reviewed the recommendations made by audit and had discussion as to
what they would like this to look like for the board office and for the agency as a
whole. There was discussion regarding how the members of the Executive
Committee utilize the Free Ride Tickets and how many were being used. Chair
Tobiassen said he would like to have the committee review the recommendations
and wanted them to have a heads up that changes were being made to this process
agency wide.

Retiree Awards
Special Recognition – TSA Gold Standard Award 2015
Chair Pro Tem Hoy announced there were no retirees this evening but there was a special
recognition for RTD’s Transit Police and Security Team who received the TSA Gold
Standard Award for the second consecutive year. He stated this is a very high accolade
for RTD. He shared that he recently was meeting with a member of the Colorado Highway
Patrol who said that RTD’ Security is top notch.
General Manager Genova explained that the TSA Gold Standard Award is given to
organizations demonstrating the highest standard of excellence in security. He pointed out
this is the second consecutive award that RTD has received, which is a great statement
for the efforts of the team lead by Chief Tarbert.
General Manager Genova pointed out that the team has been doing a great deal of
preparation for the University of Colorado A-Line Opening. The team put together an
extensive manual that has been circulated throughout our various law enforcement
partners. He looks forward to seeing them in action on Friday and Saturday.

V.

Public Participation
Chair Pro Tem Hoy stated public participation is open to anyone that wants to address the
Board. He reminded the audience that each speaker is allowed three minutes.
 Doug Gragg, Denver, congratulated everyone on the upcoming University of
Colorado A-Line opening. He has been looking forward to this line for years and
will have a wonderful time riding up and down the system. He shared that last
week he observed the Financial Administration and Audit Committee Meeting at
which the CU Leeds School of Business (Leeds) gave an economics presentation.
He expressed concern that Leeds kept saying there was low inflation. He stated
RTD cannot have Leeds come before this agency and say that inflation is low when
RTD raised fares at the first of the year. If inflation is low then RTD needs to lower
prices, not raise them.

Discussion:

Director Anderson stated she would be voting no for
the simple reason that she does not know where the
additional $2 million needed to meet the on-time
performance goal will come from. RTD has a finite
amount of financial resources and she cannot vote yes
until she knows how staff will balance the budget.
Director Menten pointed out that based on the
discussion during the Financial Administration and Audit
Committee there is nothing requiring an additional $2
million be spent. She does not want to lower RTD’s
standards, especially when the Board just approved
spending $26 million on the Civic Center renovations.
She wants to see on-time performance be a priority but
that does not mean the Board has approved spending
an additional $2 million.

Director Sisk echoed the comments of Director Bagley. He wanted to recognize Nate
Currey and Karen Benker, Citizens for Finishing FasTracks, who were on Colorado Public
Radio last week to discuss FasTracks. He thought it was a very enlightened discussion
that was handled well by all parties. He said Colorado Public Radio did a really good job
gathering background information.
Director Sisk shared that he recently had the honor of traveling to Washington, D.C. with
the US 36 Mayors and Commissioners Coalition (MCC). He stated it was a great trip and
people in D.C. are very excited about the University of Colorado A-Line. He thanked Bill
Van Meter, Assistant General Manager of Planning, for attending with him and doing the
heavy lifting. He also thanked Sherry Ellebracht, Government Relations Officer, for
providing background information so RTD was speaking together with the MCC. He thinks
it assists RTD immeasurably when we can present a united front to the outside with our
community partners.

Committee

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee and the Nominating Committee for the RTD
Citizens Advisory Committee of the Regional Transportation District (RTD) that the RTD Board of
Directors reappoint one member of the Committee to an additional three-year term and appoint five new
members to the Committee to a three-year term.
BACKGROUND
On April 22, 2004, the RTD Board of Directors adopted Resolution No. 5, Series of 2004, directing, in
part, staff to create a FasTracks Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC). On Dec.13, 2005, the RTD Board
of Directors approved the structure of the CAC including its mission and function, the duties and roles of
its members, the selection process for members, and organizational and meeting procedures for the
committee. On Dec. 16, 2008, the RTD Board of Directors increased the number of members of the
CAC from eleven to seventeen.
Since its creation in 2005, the mission of the CAC has been to review the progress of the FasTracks
Program in relation to established schedules, budget allocations, DBE goals and quality management
guidelines; to provide region-oriented advice to the Board of Directors on issues related to the
implementation of the FasTracks program; to review and provide comment on the DRCOG SB208
Annual Report; and to promote public awareness and understanding of the voter-approved FasTracks
program and its implementation. Six current members’ terms expired on December 31, 2015.
As the District completes more elements of the FasTracks Program, opens five new projects in 2016,
and works to integrate new rail service into existing operations, the issues that input from the CAC
would be relevant and meaningful to the District are increasingly agency-wide. Therefore, on February
16, 2016, based on the CAC’s individual meetings with board members conducted earlier this year,
input from staff and extensive discussion by the committee, the RTD Board of Directors RTD Board of
Directors change the name of the RTD FasTracks Citizens Advisory Committee to the RTD Citizens
Advisory Committee and revise the structure accordingly.
On February 18, 2016, recruitment for citizens interested in serving was publicly advertised through the
RTD and FasTracks Web sites, media releases, local publications and stakeholder e-mail distributions.
Applicants were asked to submit a one-page letter stating their interest in serving on the CAC along with
specific qualifications, highlights of related experience and expertise and a resume if available. A total of
45 applications were received by the March 31, 2016 deadline. Two current members were eligible for
reappointment and one expressed an interest in continuing to serve on the Committee.
The Nominating Committee decided, based on attendance, participation at meetings and Committee
consistency to recommend reappointment of the current member who requested reappointment. The
Nominating Committee then carefully reviewed each application using criteria outlined in the adopted
Committee Structure, including:

Contract Amendment for the Westminster Park
and Ride Pedestrian Bridge Painting &
Rehabilitation

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the
General Manager, or his designee, to enter into a construction contract amendment with TMI Coatings,
Inc. in the amount of $390,595.81. This Contract Amendment to the Westminster Park-N-Ride (PnR)
Pedestrian Bridge Painting & Rehabilitation Project (Contract No. 16DP001) is for the restoration of the
adjoining access ramps to the pedestrian bridge over US36 at the RTD US36 Sheridan Bus Rapid Transit
(BRT) Station. With this amendment, the total contract value would be $839,283.74
BACKGROUND
The Westminster Center (US36 & Sheridan Bus Rapid Transit Station) Pedestrian Bridge over US36 was
constructed in 1995. It is a steel truss bridge structure with a concrete deck and enclosed pedestrian
walkway. Circular steel and concrete pedestrian access ramps on both ends of the bridge were
constructed at the same time. The bridge and ramps were originally painted federal green. In 2001, the
Westminster Center Park n Ride parking garage structure was constructed on the Boulder-bound side of
US36. A steel and concrete deck ramp extension was placed between the garage and the north access
ramp. Some maintenance has been performed on the bridge and ramps. A 2014 inspection revealed
areas of rust and concrete damage that require rehabilitation. The federal green paint has, over time,
flaked and salts including magnesium chloride have eaten away various areas of the coating; the
exposed steel is rusting. See Figures 1 and 2 (below) for project location.
DISCUSSION
A Request For Proposals (RFP) and construction plans and specifications were issued in February 2016
in order to solicit quality proposals from reputable contractors who were qualified and properly certified
in the rehabilitation of pedestrian bridges and ramps. Because of funding concerns, the pedestrian
bridge was designated as a base bid and the ramps were designated as an “add alternate.”
The responding contractors provided experience and qualification evidence for: (a) Site investigations
and materials testing; (b) Restoration and construction options; (c) Preparing structural steel member
surfaces (i.e., clean and remove rust); (d) Paint complex steel structural members above a highway; (e)
Prepare and repair reinforced concrete deck; (f) Prepare and repair reinforced concrete structural
supports; (g) Remove and replace broken downspouts and gutters; (h) Apply concrete deck coating; (i)
Recent experience on similar projects with government agencies (j) Provide safe and efficient highway
traffic control, vehicular and pedestrian detours; (k) Ensure public safety, structural integrity and
continued reliability of existing infrastructure; (l) Schedule and manage regular construction meetings;
(m) Administer contracts, construction management, invoices, inspection reports and other construction
related services; (n) Assist RTD staff with site inspections; (o) Coordinate proposed work with local,
state and federal agencies including obtaining work permits.

Packet Pg. 423

11.B

The evaluation criteria included technical merits, experience, personnel and cost, weighted as follows:
 40%: knowledge, certification and technical experience, Quality Assurance/Quality Control,
structural concrete repair, highway and pedestrian traffic control, and safety.
 20%: experience and project understanding, recent similar work, coordination with government,
coordination with subcontractors and strength of organizational chart.
 40%: cost.
Proposals were accepted March 25, 2016 from three prime contractors:
(1) Gonzales Custom Painting, Inc.;
(2) TMI Coatings, Inc.;
(3) RMA Group, Inc.
A technical evaluation committee of five RTD staff members independently reviewed and rated each
proposal. A final evaluation and recommendation meeting occurred April 6, 2016. TMI Coatings, Inc.
was recommended as the most technically qualified, and had a mid-range cost that is within the project
budget.
Because of the best value determination, an award of $448,687.93 was made for the base bid. The
contract duration is 180 calendar days.
The base bid contract award will restore the bridge as follows: (1) prepare and paint steel members dark
grey, as accepted by RTD and the City of Westminster; (2) replace clear Lexan side panels; (3) remove
chain link fence; (4) patch and coat concrete decks with a skid resistant material.
This contract amendment will restore the adjoining ramps as follows; (1) repair the concrete support
columns under the Denver-bound side of US36; (2) replace the rain gutters and downspouts; (3) replace
the green vinyl clad chain link fence with grey galvanized chain link fence; (4) treat and coat the stay-inplace metal formwork of the ramp decks located over walkways; (5) patch and coat the concrete decks
with a skid resistant material.
The add alternate for this contract amendment was included in the contractor’s base bid, and will not
increase the contract duration.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
This contract amendment will utilize currently budgeted US36 BRT Local Expense funds.
PROJECT SBE GOAL
A 6% SBE goal was established by RTD. The contractor exceeded this goal for the overall project base
bid and add alternate. The base bid and add alternate amount of $839,283.74, which includes
$57,533.00 SBE work for traffic control, glazing and fencing, provides a 6.86% SBE participation.

Delay implementing the Recommended Action: Instead, reissue a new set of plans and
specifications and issue a separate Invitation for Bid for the access ramps. This is not
recommended because:
a. It delays the access ramp restoration that is needed for repair and aesthetic appearance.
b. The current accepted contractor, TMI Coatings, Inc., will perform a complete “turn-key”
project, which is determined to be the most qualified with a fair and reasonable price.
c. The Engineering Division and the Procurement Office do not believe that a separate bidding
process will give better results. A better quality of the work is anticipated with this approach.
d. The funds are currently available.
Do not award: This is not recommended because the deteriorated condition of the pedestrian
ramps, downspouts, gutters and concrete are approaching a safety concern.

Board Meeting Date: May 31, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors approves
and adopts the Pass Program Working Group objective, commitments and guiding principles.
BACKGROUND
In September of 2015, the Board of Directors approved a fare level increase to the Business and
Neighborhood Eco Pass programs and directed to staff to establish a Pass Program Working Group. The
Board Action approved in September of 2015 specifically stated: “This working group will include RTD
staff as well as stakeholders from across the District. The working group will define goals for pass
programs as well as reevaluate the 2009 Board policy for utilization based pricing to incorporate the new
fare structure and average fare analysis once smart card tap data is available.”
Staff prepared a draft of an objective, commitments and guiding principles to set the course of the Pass
Program Working Group. At the February 2016 Planning and Development Board Committee meeting,
staff presented and received input from the Board on that draft. Input received from individual Board
Directors confirmed that the draft objective, commitments and guiding principles did reflect their
priorities and concerns regarding Pass Programs.
DISCUSSION
It is important that Staff receive Board approval of the objective, commitments and guiding principles of
the Pass Program Working Group prior to the establishment of the group. These directional elements will
lead the efforts of Staff and the working group. The recommended objective, commitments and guiding
principles are detailed below.
Objective: Improve RTD pass programs to better serve customers of the district.
To achieve this objective, the Pass Program Working Group will fulfill the following commitments:
1. Revisit and refine goals for each individual pass program.
2. Refine pricing and administration of each pass program.
3. Recommend pass program policy revisions to the Board of Directors.
Below is a list of the Guiding Principles for the Pass Program Study:
1. Cost Effective Administration
2. Equitable Access
3. Improve Customer Convenience
4. Increase Ridership
5. Meet Strategic Budget Plan Revenue Targets
6. Promote Greater Brand Loyalty
7. Provide RTD revenue certainty
8. Simplify Passenger-Operator Interaction

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
accept and enter into the record the District’s audited financial reports relating to the year ended
December 31, 2015 as prepared by staff and audited by RTD's independent auditor, RubinBrown, LLP.
BACKGROUND
State statutes require an annual audit by independent certified public accountants. RTD is also required
to provide annual audited financial statements to external entities and other government organizations to
be in full compliance with legal covenants, debt agreements, and other contractual documents. The
accounting firm of RubinBrown, LLP performed the 2015 audit. In addition to the requirements set forth
in state statutes, the audit also was designed to fulfill the requirements of the federal Single Audit Act of
1984 and related OMB circular A-133.
DISCUSSION
As stated in the auditor’s unmodified opinion, the financial statements in the enclosed Comprehensive
Annual Financial Report (CAFR) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of RTD as of
December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of its operations and its cash flow for the 2015 and
2014 fiscal years in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept and enter into the record RTD’s audited financial reports relating to the year ended
December 31, 2015 as prepared by staff and audited by RTD's independent auditor, RubinBrown,
LLP. This is the recommended action, state statutes and other sources, such as rating agencies
and other legal covenants, require RTD to enter annual audited financial statements into the
record.
2. Do not accept and enter into the record the audited financial reports relating to the year ended
December 31, 2015 as prepared by staff and audited by RTD’s independent auditor, RubinBrown,
LLP. This is not the recommended action, since state statutes and other sources, such as rating
agencies and other legal covenants, require RTD to enter annual audited financial statements into
the record.

Board of Directors
Regional Transportation District
Denver, Colorado
In accordance with Colorado statutes and Regional Transportation District (RTD) bylaws, the enclosed Comprehensive Annual
Financial Report of the Regional Transportation District as of December 31, 2015, has been compiled. Responsibility for the
accuracy of the presented data and the completeness and fairness of the presentation, including all disclosures, rests with RTD.
Management believes the data, as presented, fairly sets forth the financial position and operating results of RTD. Disclosures
necessary to enable the reader to gain the maximum understanding of the financial affairs of RTD have been included.
In developing and evaluating RTD’s accounting system, consideration has been given to the adequacy of internal accounting controls.
These controls are discussed by the Chief Financial Officer in the Letter of Transmittal. Within that framework, we believe RTD’s
internal accounting controls adequately safeguard assets and provide reasonable assurance of the proper recording of financial
transactions.
This report has been prepared according to the guidelines recommended by the Government Finance Officers Association of the
United States and Canada. In accordance with these guidelines, the accompanying report is presented in three parts:
1.

Introductory Section, including the Chief Financial Officer’s Letter of Transmittal.

2.

Financial Section containing the independent auditor’s report, Management’s Discussion and Analysis, the financial
statements, notes thereto and supplemental information.

3.

Statistical Section, including selected tables of unaudited data depicting the financial history of RTD, demographics, and
other miscellaneous information.

Colorado law requires the governing bodies of local governments to have an independent audit of RTD’s financial statements
performed. RTD has complied with this requirement and has included the report of the independent auditors in the Financial Section
of this report.
Preparation of this Comprehensive Annual Financial Report could not have been accomplished without the dedicated efforts of the
entire financial staff. Should you have any questions or comments, please contact me or Heather Copp, Chief Financial Officer.
Respectfully submitted,

Mr. Tom Tobiassen
Chair, Executive Committee
Regional Transportation District
State law requires that all general-purpose local governments publish within seven months of the close of each fiscal year a
complete set of financial statements presented in conformance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and
audited in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards by a firm of licensed certified public accountants. Pursuant
to that requirement, we hereby issue the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report of the Regional Transportation District
(RTD) for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.
This report consists of management’s representations concerning the finances of RTD. Consequently, management assumes
full responsibility for the completeness and reliability of all of the information presented in this report. To provide a reasonable
basis for making these representations, management of RTD has established a comprehensive internal control framework that
is designed both to protect the government’s assets from loss, theft, or misuse and to compile sufficient, reliable information
for the preparation of RTD’s financial statements in conformity with GAAP. Because the cost of internal controls should not
outweigh their benefits, RTD’s comprehensive framework of internal controls has been designed to provide reasonable rather
than absolute assurance that the financial statements will be free from material misstatement. As management, we assert
that, to the best of our knowledge and belief, this financial report is complete and reliable in all material respects.
RTD’s financial statements have been audited by RubinBrown, LLP, a firm of licensed certified public accountants. The goal of
the independent audit was to provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements of RTD for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2015, are free of material misstatement. The independent audit involved examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements; assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management; and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. The independent auditor
concluded, based upon the audit, that there was a reasonable basis for rendering an unmodified opinion that RTD’s financial
statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, are fairly presented in conformity with GAAP. The independent
auditor’s report is presented as the first component of the Financial Section of this report.
The independent audit of the financial statements of RTD was part of a broader, federally mandated “Single Audit” designed
to meet the special needs of federal grantor agencies. The standards governing Single Audit engagements require the
independent auditor to report not only on the fair presentation of the financial statements, but also on the audited
government’s internal controls and compliance with legal requirements, with special emphasis on internal controls and legal
requirements involving the administration of federal awards. These reports are in RTD’s separately issued Single Audit Report.
GAAP requires that management provide a narrative introduction, overview, and analysis to accompany the basic financial
statements in the form of Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A). This letter of transmittal is designed to
complement the MD&A and should be read in conjunction with it. RTD’s MD&A can be found immediately following the
report of the independent auditors.
REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT (RTD)
RTD provides public mass transit service to the Denver metropolitan area. In 1969, the Colorado General Assembly
(Assembly) found that public transit was a necessary part of the growing Denver Metropolitan Region. The Assembly found

RTD boundaries now include Jefferson, Boulder, and Denver counties, most of the City and County of Broomfield, and
portions of Adams, Douglas, Weld, and Arapahoe counties. Over 2.87 million people, or approximately 57% of the population
of Colorado, reside within RTD’s 2,340 square mile area.
Since 1983, RTD has had a fifteen-member Board of Directors that are elected by their constituents to serve four-year terms
to govern RTD. There are approximately 190,000 voters per director district. The RTD Board of Directors is responsible for
setting policy, overseeing the agency’s annual budget, and establishing short and long-range transit goals and plans in
concert with local, state, and federal agencies.
RTD employs over 2,700 men and women, making it one of the largest employers in the eight county areas. In addition, RTD
contracts with private carriers to provide access-a-ride and fixed route services employing over 1,700 men and women.
Besides its administrative headquarters in Denver, RTD has six operating facilities, including three in Denver, one in Aurora,
one in Englewood, and one in Boulder.
The financial reporting entity includes all of the financial activities of RTD, as well as those activities of its component unit,
the Asset Acquisition Authority, Inc. (the Authority), a nonprofit corporation established to facilitate RTD’s use of
lease/purchase financing.
RTD also maintains budgetary controls. These controls ensure compliance with legal provisions embodied in the annual
appropriated budget approved by RTD’s Board of Directors. The budget sets forth proposed outlays for operations, planning,
administration, development, debt service, and capital assets. The level of budgetary control (that is, the level at which
expenditures cannot legally exceed the appropriated amount) is established at the project level.
The annual budget serves as the foundation for RTD’s financial planning and control. All departments of RTD are required to
submit requests for appropriation to the General Manager on or before August 1st of each year. The General Manager uses
these requests as the starting point for developing a proposed budget. The General Manager then presents this proposed
budget to the Board of Directors for review prior to October 15th. The Board of Directors is required to hold a public hearing
on the proposed budget and to adopt a final budget no later than December 31st.
Unused appropriations lapse at year end, except that the Board of Directors has the authority, as stated in the adopted
appropriation resolution, to carry-over the unused portion of the funds for capital projects not completed, for a period not to
exceed three years.
RTD’s policy also authorizes the General Manager to approve certain line-item transfers within the budget. Budget-to-actual
comparisons are provided in the Supplemental Information Section of this report.
Factors Affecting Financial Condition
The information presented in the financial statements is perhaps best understood when it is considered in the broader
perspective of the specific environment within which RTD operates.
RTD serves the eight-county region considered the Denver metropolitan area. It is the most populated area of the state and
the economic barometer of Colorado. Employment in the Denver Metro area is dominated by small businesses. These
companies represent a diverse mix of industries and are located throughout the Denver metropolitan area, providing a
geographic balance in employment centers.

Attachment: 1.A 2015 RTD Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (05-2016) (2792 : 2015 CAFR and Report to Governance)

that public sector involvement was the best method to ensure the continuation of this vital component. Thus, the Regional
Transportation District was created as a political subdivision of the State effective July 1969 “to develop, maintain, and
operate a public mass transportation system for the benefit of the District.”

On November 3, 1992, the voters of Colorado approved a Constitutional Amendment (the “Amendment”) that limits taxes,
revenue, and spending for state and local governments effective December 31, 1992. On November 7, 1995, the voters of
the District exempted RTD from the revenue and spending limitations concerning the Amendment through December 31,
2005. On November 2, 1999, the voters of the District further exempted RTD from the revenue and spending limitations
outlined in the Amendment for the purpose of paying any debt incurred to finance the construction of the Southeast and
Southwest light rail lines or to operate such for as long as any debt remains outstanding, but in no event beyond
December 31, 2026.
On November 2, 2004, the voters of the District authorized an increase in the District’s sales and use tax rate from 0.6% to
1.0%, effective January 1, 2005, to finance the FasTracks transit improvement program. This authorization also exempted
the District from any revenue and spending limitations on the additional tax and on any investment income generated by the
increased tax revenue, and allowed RTD to incur debt to finance the capital improvements included in the FasTracks
program. At the time that all FasTracks debt is repaid, the District’s sales and use tax rate will be reduced to a rate
sufficient to operate the transit system financed through FasTracks.
Long-term Financial Planning
Each year the Board of Directors adopts a financially constrained Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) which is the six-year operating
and capital improvement plan of RTD. It reflects RTD’s plans for service and capital improvements excluding FasTracks. In
November 2010, the Board of Directors convened a Fiscal Sustainability Task Force for the purpose of developing a formal
written report that was submitted to the Board of Directors in June 2011, detailing opportunities for operating efficiencies
and revenue enhancements to ensure RTD’s fiscal sustainability in the long term. The Task Force consisted of 21 members
from RTD management, the Board of Directors and the public and private sector. The Board of Directors gave approval to
management to pursue implementation of the Task Force’s recommendations. The SBP includes those recommendations that
have been implemented in the SBP timeframe, most notably an operational service adjustment, enhanced sales and use tax
forecasts and implementation of a revised fund balance policy which was implemented in 2013.
In addition to the SBP, RTD is planning and constructing the build-out of the FasTracks transit expansion plan. FasTracks
entails the addition of new bus rapid transit, light-rail lines and commuter rail lines, the redevelopment of Denver Union
Station, and expanded bus service throughout the eight county District. Each year, RTD conducts a comprehensive
evaluation of the entire FasTracks program, called an Annual Program Evaluation. RTD has worked closely with elected
officials, local governments, corridor stakeholders and the public to move the FasTracks program forward.
FINANCIAL INFORMATION
RTD management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an internal control structure designed to ensure that assets
are protected from loss, theft, or misuse and that adequate accounting data are compiled to allow for the preparation of
financial statements in conformity with GAAP. RTD has designed its internal control structure to provide reasonable, but not
absolute, assurance that these objectives are met. The concept of reasonable assurance recognizes that: (1) the costs of a

The Colorado Legislative Council (CLC) in its December 2015 report forecasts that the economy is expected to grow at a
more moderate place, reflecting slower economic growth. Economists for CLC reported the following key economic
indicators:

9
Packet Pg. 448

11.D.a

Single Audit: As a recipient of federal assistance, RTD is responsible for ensuring that an adequate internal control
structure is instituted to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations related to those programs. This internal
control structure is subject to periodic evaluation by management and the RTD internal audit staff.
As part of RTD’s single audit, tests are made to determine the adequacy of the internal control structure, including that
portion related to federal financial assistance programs, as well as to evaluate RTD’s compliance. RTD’s single audit for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 found no instances of material weakness in the internal control structures or
significant violations of applicable laws and regulations. A separate report was prepared for this purpose.
Fiscal Policy: RTD follows a fiscal policy approved by the Board of Directors annually or as necessary due to modification.
The fiscal policy contains policies for revenue, investments, expenditures, capital improvements, fund balance, debt,
budgeting, accounting and grants. In 2012, RTD modified its fund balance policy to establish a structure that was
recommended by the RTD Fiscal Sustainability Task Force as being a necessary tool in designating funds to be available for
specific purposes to ensure fiscal sustainability.
Debt Administration: RTD formulates its debt policy to protect its credit ratings and soundly manage its assets and
liabilities. Included in this policy is a requirement that debt will not be used to finance current operations. Another
requirement precludes financing capital projects beyond the useful life of the project. Additional policies go beyond these
essential guidelines and result in further protection. RTD has a dual rating for its 1.0% sales tax credit. Moody’s Investors
Service rates the sales tax credit as “Aa2”, Standard and Poor’s Corporation rates the sales tax credit “AAA” and Fitch
Ratings rates the sales tax credit “AA+” that are secured by the 0.6% sales tax. Moody’s Investors Service rates the sales
tax credit as “Aa2”, Standard and Poor’s Corporation rates the sales tax credit “AA+” and Fitch Ratings rates the sales tax
credit “AA” that are secured by the 0.4% sales tax.
Cash Management: The main objective of RTD’s cash management program is the protection of investment principal while
providing optimal levels of cash throughout the year. The RTD investment policy is modified periodically to adapt to changes
in eligible investments, benchmarks, and specific objectives.
During the year, RTD invested its cash in various investment vehicles including money market funds, U.S. Treasury securities,
agency securities, discount notes, commercial paper, repurchase agreements, and variable and fixed rate mortgage-backed
securities. The total average return on investments for the year was 0.5%.
Risk Management: RTD employs a combination of self-insurance and purchased insurance in its efforts to protect assets
and control and prevent losses.
The areas of self-insurance are worker’s compensation, automobile and general liability. RTD is self-insured for liability, the
limits of which are $350,000 per person and $990,000 per occurrence as specified under the Colorado Governmental
Immunity statute. The self-insured retention for worker’s compensation claims is $2,000,000 per claim, with any amounts
above this covered by purchased insurance up to the legal limits of liability under the Colorado worker’s compensation
statute.
Commercial insurance policies provide property coverage up to $1,663,245,896 for buildings, their contents, and rolling
stock (other than collision); a Commercial Crime Policy and Faithful Performance Bond; a $3,500,000 Workers’
Compensation Bond; Felonious Assault Policy; travel insurance for employees on RTD business; fidelity coverage on the
Trustees of the Union Pension Trust, Salaried Pension Trust, Represented Health and Welfare Union Trust, Legal Trust, and
the employees administering the health benefits program for salaried employees. With the growth of Light Rail Transit (LRT)
services, RTD has added Railroad Protective and Railroad Liability commercial insurance policies that provide coverage when
required under operational needs.

control should not exceed the benefits likely to be derived and (2) the valuation of costs and benefits requires estimates and
judgment by management.

OTHER INFORMATION
Independent Audit: State statutes require an annual audit by independent certified public accountants. The accounting firm
of RubinBrown LLP was selected to perform the 2015 audit. This audit also was designated to meet the requirements of the
Federal Single Audit 2 CFR 200.501, Uniform Grant Guidance and related 2 CFR 200, Uniform Grant Guidance – Uniform
Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles and Audit Requirements. The auditor’s report on the financial statements and
schedules are included in the Financial Section of this report. The auditor’s report related specifically to the single audit is
included in a separate report.
Awards: The Government Finance Officers Associations (GFOA) awarded a Certificate of Achievement for Excellence in
Financial Reporting to RTD for its Comprehensive Annual Financial Report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014. This
is the twenty-third consecutive year, after a two-year absence from the program, that RTD has been awarded this
prestigious award.
In order to receive the Certificate of Achievement for Excellence in Financial Reporting, RTD must publish an easily readable
and efficiently organized Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the contents of which must conform to program standards.
This report must also satisfy both GAAP and applicable legal requirements.
The Certificate of Achievement is valid for one year only. We believe our current Comprehensive Annual Financial Report
meets the program’s requirements and will be submitting it to the GFOA to determine its eligibility for another certificate.
Acknowledgements: Preparation of the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report on a timely basis was made possible by
the dedicated services of the entire staff of the Finance Division. Each member of the division has our sincere appreciation
for the contributions made in the preparation of this report.
Finally, without the leadership and support of the members of the RTD’s Board of Directors, preparation of this report would
not have been possible.
Sincerely,
Heather Copp
Chief Financial Officer

Report On The Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of Regional Transportation
District (RTD) as of and for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 and the
related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise RTD’s basic
financial statements as listed in the table of contents.
Management’s Responsibility For The Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial
statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America; this includes the design, implementation and maintenance of
internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditors’ Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our
audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial
audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General
of the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from
material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the
auditors’ judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of
the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk
assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation
and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. Accordingly, we express no
such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting
policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to
provide a basis for our audit opinion.

Opinion
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of RTD as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the
changes in its financial position and its cash flows for the years then ended in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.
Emphasis Of Matters
As discussed in Note A.19, the Board adopted the provisions of the Governmental
Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Statement No. 68, Accounting and Financial
Reporting for Pensions-An Amendment of GASB No. 27, effective July 1, 2014. Our
opinions were not modified with respect to this matter.
Other Matters
Required Supplementary Information
Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that
the management’s discussion and analysis and pension plan summary information on
pages 23 through 34 and 80 through 85, respectively, be presented to supplement the
basic financial statements. Such information, although not a part of the basic financial
statements, is required by GASB, which considers it to be an essential part of financial
reporting for placing the basic financial statements in an appropriate operational,
economic or historical context. We have applied certain limited procedures to the
required supplementary information in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America, which consisted of inquiries of management
about the methods of preparing the information and comparing the information for
consistency with management’s responses to our inquiries, the basic financial
statements and other knowledge we obtained during our audit of the basic financial
statements. We do not express an opinion or provide any assurance on the information
because the limited procedures do not provide us with sufficient evidence to express an
opinion or provide any assurance.
Supplementary And Other Information
Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the financial
statements that collectively comprise RTD’s basic financial statements. The
accompanying budgetary information, summary schedules, introductory section and
statistical section are presented for purposes of additional analysis and are not a
required part of the basic financial statements.

The budgetary information is the responsibility of management and was derived from
and relates directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the
basic financial statements. Such information has been subjected to the auditing
procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements and certain additional
procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the
underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements
or to the basic financial statements themselves, and other additional procedures in
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America.
In our opinion, the budgetary information is fairly stated, in all material respects, in
relation to the financial statements as a whole.
The summary schedules, introductory and statistical sections have not been subjected
to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements, and
accordingly, we do not express an opinion or provide any assurance on them.
Other Reporting Required By Government Auditing Standards
In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report
dated May 5, 2016 on our consideration of RTD’s internal control over financial
reporting and on our tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations,
contracts and grant agreements and other matters. The purpose of that report is to
describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting and
compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on internal
control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an
audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering
RTD’s internal control over financial reporting and compliance.

The management of the Regional Transportation District (RTD) offers users of our financial statements this narrative overview and
analysis of the financial activities for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. This discussion and analysis is designed to assist
the reader to focus on significant financial activities and identify any significant changes in the financial position of RTD. It should be read
in conjunction with the financial statements that follow this section. All amounts, unless otherwise indicated, are expressed in thousands
of dollars.
Key Reporting Implementations
In fiscal year 2015 RTD implemented the provisions of GASB Statement No. 68, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions, and
GASB Statement 71, Pension Transition for Contributions Made Subsequent to the Measurement Date. GASB Statement Nos. 68 and 71
establish standards for measuring and recognizing net pension liabilities, deferred outflows of resources, deferred inflows of resources,
and expenses related to pension benefits provided through defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans.
Financial Highlights
As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, total assets and deferred outflows of resources of RTD exceeded total liabilities and deferred
inflows of resources by $3,176,938 and $3,181,074, respectively. The amount of unrestricted net position as of December 31, 2015
was $(199,265) compared to $18,842 in 2014. RTD’s unrestricted net position was negatively impacted by the implementation of GASB
Statement No. 68, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions (GASB 68). GASB 68 required RTD to record the amount of
unfunded pension liabilities. More information on the pension plans is available in the Notes starting on page 59.
The net position of RTD decreased by $4,136 during the current year compared to an increase of $203,625 in the previous year. The
decrease in 2015 was the result of the GASB 68 new financial reporting requirement. The increase for 2014 was due to higher operating
revenues, sales and use tax and grant revenues, net of increases in operating expenses and non-operating expenses which resulted from
an improving economy combined with revenue enhancement and expense reduction initiatives undertaken by RTD.
RTD’s sales and use tax revenues are its largest single source of revenues. These tax revenues increased $26,797 (5.2%) in 2015 and
increased $46,135 (9.8%) in the previous year due to broad-based increases in retail sales within the District as the local economy
emerges from the recession.
For 2015, total operating expenses exceeded total revenues resulting in a loss before non-operating revenue and expenses of $535,478
compared to a loss of $534,199 for 2014. The increase in operating loss for 2015 was due to the increased cost of salaries and fringe
benefits. RTD anticipates operating losses, as these losses are subsidized by non-operating sales and use tax, grant revenues and other
miscellaneous income.
RTD’s total debt increased $230,096 (7.1%) and increased $501,624 (18.5%) in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Debt increased in 2015
due to issuance of certificates of participation for the purpose of funding scheduled acquisition of equipment, buses and light rail vehicles.
Debt increased in 2014 due to the issuance of certificates of participation primarily for the purpose of funding of construction of North
Metro Rail Line as well as well as borrowings on the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) bond for
construction of the FasTracks project elements.
Capital grants and local contributions decreased $37,118 (18.0%) in 2015 and decreased $36,135 (14.9%) in the previous year. The
decrease in 2015 occurred as a result of several major construction project being completed, U.S. 36 Manages Lanes, Denver Union
Station, and West Rail Line, reducing grant funding. The decrease in 2014 occurred as a result of the reduced contributed capital from the
Denver Union Station construction project which was completed in 2014.
RTD’s capital assets, excluding depreciation, increased $798,324 in 2015 and increased $814,250 in 2014. The increase in 2015 was
primarily due to the build-out of Fastracks project. The increase in 2014 was from replacement of fleet and build-out of Fastracks
project.

Basic Financial Statements
Management’s Discussion and Analysis serves as an introduction to RTD’s basic financial statements. RTD’s financial statements are
prepared using proprietary fund (enterprise fund) accounting that uses the same basis of accounting as private-sector business
enterprises. Under this method of accounting, an economic resources measurement focus and an accrual basis of accounting is used.
Revenue is recorded when earned and expenses are recorded when incurred.
The basic financial statements are comprised of four components: statements of net position; statements of revenues, expenses and
changes in net position; statements of cash flows; and notes to the financial statements.
The statements of net position presents information on assets and deferred outflows of resource and liabilities and deferred inflows of
resources, with the difference between the two reported as the net position. Over time, increases or decreases in net position may serve
as a useful indicator of whether the financial position of RTD is improving or deteriorating. The statements of revenues, expenses, and
changes in net position presents information on operating revenues and expenses and non-operating revenues and expenses of RTD for the
fiscal year with the difference, the net income or loss, combined with any capital grants and local contributions to determine the change
in net position for the year. That change combined with the previous year-end total net position reconciles to the net position total at the
end of the current fiscal year. All changes in net position are reported as soon as the underlying event giving rise to the changes occurs,
regardless of the timing of the related cash flows.
The statements of cash flows reports cash and cash equivalent activities for the fiscal year resulting from operating activities, capital,
and related financing activities, noncapital and related financing activities and investing activities. The result of these activities added to
the beginning of the year cash balance reconciles to the cash and cash equivalents balance at the end of the current fiscal year. The
statements of cash flows, along with the related notes and information in other financial statements, can be used to assess the following:
RTD’s ability to generate positive cash flows and pay its debt as the debt matures; the reasons for differences between RTD’s operating
cash flows and operating income (loss); and the effect of investing, capital, and financing activities on RTD’s financial position.
The notes to the financial statements provide additional information that is essential to fully understand the data provided in the
statement of net position, statement of revenues, expenses, and changes in net position, and statement of cash flows.
RTD provides bus, paratransit, and light rail service in a 2,340 square mile area in and around Denver, Colorado. The activities of RTD are
supported by a 0.6% and 0.4% sales and use tax collected within the District. The 0.6% sales and use tax is used to fund the Base
System operations of RTD. The Base System operations provide the bus and the majority of current light rail services in the Denver area.
The 0.4% sales and use tax funds the FasTracks build-out program and operation and maintenance of those program elements as well as
providing for enhanced transit services in the District. Additional revenue sources include fare collections, federal, state, and local
financial assistance, investment income, and other income such as advertising and rental income.
Financial Analysis
Condensed Financial Information - Condensed financial information from the statements of net position and statements of revenues,
expenses, and changes in net position is presented below.
Statements of Net Position – As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, total assets and deferred outflows of resources of RTD exceeded
total liabilities and deferred inflows of resources by $3,176,938 and $3,181,074, respectively. The largest portion of this excess, in
2015 and in 2014, was invested in capital assets, net of related debt. RTD uses these capital assets to provide public transportation
services to customers; consequently, these assets are not available for future spending. Although RTD’s investment in capital assets
is reported net of related debt, it should be noted that funding required to repay this debt will be obtained from other sources such as
sales and use tax, since the capital assets themselves cannot be used to pay the related debt. The amount of unrestricted net position
as of December 31, 2015 was $(199,265) compared to $18,842 in 2014. Substantially all of the unrestricted net position, although
not legally restricted, has been appropriated or reserved by the RTD Board for future capital acquisition and reserve policy

requirements, and debt liquidation during the budget process. The deficit balance in Unrestricted Net Position includes an allowance
for a Net Pension Liability of $284,175 in 2015 for the represented employee defined benefit pension plan (see Note I). RTD has
recognized this liability in its financial statements in accordance with GASB Statement 68; however, RTD is current in making all
required contributions under the collective bargaining agreement.

In 2015, capital assets net of accumulated depreciation increased $718,153 (13.3%) for acquisition of revenue equipment, buildings,
land, and construction in progress for the projects in the FasTracks program.
Current liabilities decreased $23,119 (7.4%) in 2015 primarily due to an accrued lower construction payment for the FasTracks Eagle P3
project to the project concessionaire due in early 2016.
Noncurrent liabilities and deferred inflows increased $570,097 (16.8%) primarily due implementation of GASB Statement No. 68,
Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions, and GASB Statement 71, Pension Transition for Contributions Made Subsequent to the
Measurement Date. In addition, to the issuance of certificates of participation for acquisition of equipment, buses, light rail vehicles.
The net position of RTD decreased by $4,136 during the current year compared to an increase of $203,625 in the previous year. The
decrease in 2015 was the result of GASB 68 new financial reporting requirement. The increases in 2014 was due to higher operating
revenues, grant revenue income and sales and use tax collection increases, net of increases in operating expenses and non-operating
expenses.
Statements of Revenues, Expenses, and Changes in Net Position–The following summary of revenues, expenses, and changes in net
position shows the activities of RTD resulted in change of net position. The key elements of changes in net position for the fiscal years

Passenger fares – Passenger fares provided 13.0% and 12.8% of total revenues in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Farebox receipts,
monthly and annual pass revenue, and special event fares for bus and rail services are included in passenger fares. Passenger fares
increased by $33 (0%) in 2015 compared to an increase of $2,656 (2.3%) in 2014. Passenger fares changes in 2015 were minimal. The
increase in 2014 was due in part, to full year of revenue service of the West Line light rail line which opened in April 2013.
Advertising and other – Advertising and other revenue provided 0.6% and 0.5% of total revenues in 2015 and 2014; this includes
revenues from advertisements primarily on RTD’s buses and external wraps on light rail vehicles. Advertising and other income increased
$941 (21.4%) in 2015 compared to a decrease of $793 (15.3%) in 2014. The increase in 2015 was due an increase in advertising
revenue related to a stronger economic growth. The decrease in 2014 was primarily due to reduced joint venture revenue contracts.
Sales and Use Tax – Sales and use tax provided 58.6% and 54.8% of RTD’s total revenues in 2015 and 2014 respectively. Sales and
use tax is a dedicated 1.0% tax imposed on certain sales within the service area. Sales and use tax increased $26,797 (5.2%) in 2015
compared to an increase of $46,135 (9.8%) in 2014. In 2015 and 2014, the District experienced growth in tax revenues due to increased
consumer and business spending activity as the local economy continues to emerge from the recession.
Grant operating assistance – Grant operating assistance provided 7.9% and 8.0% of total revenues in 2015 and 2014. Grant
operating assistance decreased $2,161 (2.9%) in 2015 compared to a decrease of $12,699 (14.4%) in 2014. The operating assistance is
a federal grant revenue program used to perform capital maintenance and maintain RTD’s revenue fleet of bus, paratransit, and rail
vehicles. The decrease in 2015 and 2014 is the result of grant funding sources being available during the year.
Investment Income – Investment income provided 0.34% and 0.02% of total revenues in 2015 and 2014. Investment income increased
$2,999 (1817.6%) in 2015 compared to a decrease of $1,875 (91.9%) in 2014. The increase in 2015 was due to fixed securities getting
better yields in 2015 and progressively higher investment balances. The decrease in 2014 was due to lower investment balance as
invested funds are being utilized for the build-out of the FasTracks project in addition to unrealized losses attributed to mark-to-market
valuation under a rising interest rate environment.
Other Income/Gain on sale of Assets – Other income provided 1.2% and 1.8% of total revenues in 2015 and 2014. Other income
decreased $5,454 (32.3%) in 2015 compared to an increase of $11,309 (40.1%) in 2014. Other income includes interest subsidy income,
rental income from retail space, parking, and miscellaneous other items. The decrease in 2015 was due to reduction of asset sales which
was primarily attributable to the Denver Union Stations land parcels sold 2014. The decrease in 2014 was due to the one time increase in
2013 which was primarily attributable to the sale of RTD’s Civic Center air rights and the sale of an easement on RTD property.
Capital grants and local contributions – Capital grants and local contributions provided 18.3% and 22.0% of total revenues in 2015
and 2014. Capital grants and local contributions decreased $37,118 (18.0%) in 2015 and decreased $36,135 (14.9%) in the previous
year. The decrease in both years resulted from lower capital contributions related to completion of major construction projects: West Rail
line, U.S. 36 Manages Lanes and Denver Union Station multi-modal hub.

Packet Pg. 468

Salaries and wages–Salary and wage expense is the largest expense category accounting for 20.3% and 19.5% of the total RTD
expenses in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Salary and wage expenses increased by $7,695 (5.4%) in 2015 compared to an increase of
$7,453 (5.5%) in 2014. Increases in both years occurred from salary and wage performance (result based) and progression increases.
Benefits – Fringe benefits accounted for 10.3% and 8.4% of total expenses in 2015 and 2014. Fringe benefits increased by $14,722
(23.9%) compared to an increase of $4,932 (8.7%) in 2014. The increase in 2015 is primarily due to implementation GASB Statement
Nos. 68 and 71 establish standards for measuring and recognizing net pension liabilities. The increase in 2014 is primarily due to medical
costs; resulting from CBA employer contribution ranging from $165-$185/employee increase and salaried medical costs also increased
from prior year. Pension cost also increased in 2014 due to increased wages.
Materials and supplies – The materials and supplies expense category accounted for 7.9% and 8.5% of the total RTD expenses in 2015
and 2014 respectively. Materials and supplies expenses decreased $3,272 (5.3%) in 2015 compared to a decrease of $2,642 (4.1%) in
2014. The decrease in both years is primarily due to a decrease in diesel/gasoline fuel prices. In addition, replacement bus fleet
acquisition lowered costs of repair parts.
Services – Services expense accounted for 10.7% and 14.8% of total expenses in 2015 and 2014. Services expense includes
contracted services such as security services; vehicle, equipment and right of way maintenance services; advertising and marketing
services, and legal services. Services expense decreased $29,171 (26.8%) in 2015 compared to an increase of $3,559 (3.2%) in 2014.
The decrease in 2015 was primarily due to the contract service reduction for U.S. 36 managed lane project (Phase I).
Utilities – Utilities accounted for 1.8% and 1.9% of total expenses in 2015 and 2014. Utilities expense includes electric,
telecommunications, water and sewer, and natural gas for facilities. Utilities expense decreased $478 (3.4%) in 2015 compared to an
increase of $584 (4.3%) in 2014. The decrease in 2015 occurred due to reduction of traction power costs as a result of West Rail Line
reduced rail passenger car capacity. The increase in 2014 occurred primarily due to higher electricity rates affecting traction power costs
for light rail services.
Insurance – Insurance accounted for 1.1% and 0.7% of total expenses in 2015 and 2014. Insurance expense includes RTD’s self-insured
cost for general liability and worker’s compensation claims. In addition, RTD purchased insurance in its efforts to protect assets.
Insurance expense increased $2,829 (53.7%) in 2015 compared to a decrease of $295 (5.3%) in 2014. The increase in 2015 was due
increased frequency and severity of claims. The decrease in 2014 was due to reduction of claim activity.
Purchased transportation – The purchased transportation expense category accounted for 15.2% and 15.6% of the total expenses in
2015 and 2014. Purchased transportation represents the costs of contracted transportation services for bus, access-a-Ride, and call-nRide services. Purchased transportation costs decreased $1,726 (1.5%) in 2015 compared to an increase of $1,936 (1.7%) in 2014. The
decrease in 2015 was primarily due to reduction in service. The increase in 2014 was primarily due to negotiated contract rate increases.
Leases and rentals – Leases and rentals include lease expense for office space, office equipment, park-n-Ride facilities, and use of
communication towers. Leases and rentals expense increased $198 (6.1%) in 2015 compared to an increase of $54 (1.7%) in 2014. The
increase for both years is primarily due to RTD’s need for additional office space.
Miscellaneous – Miscellaneous expense includes other incidental operating expenses not included in other defined categories.
Miscellaneous expenses decreased $2,030 (30.9%) in 2015 compared to an increase of $113 (1.8%) in 2014. This category includes
additional one-time project expenses creating fluctuations between years.
Depreciation – The depreciation expense category accounted for 20.5% and 18.9% of the total RTD expenses in 2015 and 2014,
respectively. Depreciation expense is a non-cash systematic allocation of the cost of capital assets over the estimated useful life of the
assets. Depreciation expense increased $13,486 (9.7%) in 2015 compared to an increase of $11,789 (9.3%) in 2014. The increase in

2015 occurred primarily due the acquisition of new fleets, CAD/AVL and build-out of FasTracks. The increase in 2014 occurred primarily
from the activation of the West Line into revenue service in April.
Interest expense – The interest expense category accounted for 10.7% and 9.8% of the total RTD expenses in 2015 and 2014,
respectively. Interest expense increased $7,393 (10.2%) in 2015 compared to an increase of $11,070 (18.1%) in 2014. Interest expense
increases are due to the additional borrowings surrounding the FasTracks build-out and scheduled fleet replacements.
Other expense – Other expense includes miscellaneous non-operating expenses not classified in other expense categories. Other expense
decreased $2,183 (60.6%) in 2015 compared to a decrease of $541 (13.0%) in 2014. The decrease in both years was the result on
reduced loss of sales of assets compared to prior year.
Capital Assets – Investments in capital assets include: land and rights-of-way; buildings and improvements; leasehold improvements;
revenue and non-revenue vehicles; shop and service equipment; security and surveillance equipment; computer equipment; and furniture.
RTD’s investment in capital assets, net of accumulated depreciation, in 2015 was $6,131,608 compared to $5,413,455 in 2014. The
increase in capital assets in 2015 was $718,153 (13.3%) compared to an increase of $716,720 (15.3%) in 2014. RTD acquires its
assets with sales and use tax revenues, farebox revenue, federal capital grants, and proceeds from the sale of revenue bonds and
certificates of participation. The increases during 2015 and 2014 were primarily due to the cost of planning, design and construction of
FasTracks projects and fleet acquisition.
The following table summarizes capital assets, net of accumulated depreciation, as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 with comparative

East and Gold Line Public-Private Partnership (Eagle P3) RTD was selected for inclusion in the FTA Public-Private Partnership Pilot Program (Penta-P). In 2010, RTD entered into a public-private
partnership to design, build, finance, operate and maintain several of the transit improvements contemplated under the FasTracks
program. The Eagle P3 project is a $2,185,000 project that includes a Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility, the East and Gold Line
Corridors as well as the Northwest Rail Electrified Segment. The Eagle P3 partnership was awarded to a concessionaire, Denver Transit
Partners (DTP), through a competitive bid process culminating in a contract price that was $305,000 below internal estimates. The
project is expected to begin revenue service in 2016.
The Eagle P3 project will be completed in two phases. Phase I includes the East Corridor, Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility and design
work for Phase II. Phase II includes the Gold Line Corridor and the Northwest Electrified Rail Segment. In 2015, construction
expenditures related to the Eagle P3 project were $350,156. The Eagle P3 Project elements are described below:
FasTracks East Corridor - The East Corridor is a 23.6-mile commuter rail transit corridor between Denver Union Station and Denver
International Airport. The East Corridor opened for revenue service in April 2016.
FasTracks Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility - The Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility is being designed to service the four
planned commuter rail corridors (East Corridor, Gold Line, North Metro, and Northwest Rail) included in the FasTracks plan. The
Facility opened in 2015.
FasTracks Gold Line Corridor - The Gold Line Corridor is an 11.2 mile rail transit corridor between Denver Union Station to the
vicinity of Ward Road, passing through northwest Denver, unincorporated Adams County, Arvada, and Wheat Ridge. The Gold Line is
planned to be open for revenue service in Fall 2016.
FasTracks Northwest Electrified Rail Segment – The Northwest Rail Corridor, described previously, includes a project segment,
referred to as the Northwest Electrified Rail Segment, extending from Denver Union Station to Westminster. This segment is planned
to be open for revenue service in Summer 2016, which will be completed under the Eagle P3 Project Phase II which was issued a
notice to proceed in 2011.
FasTracks I-225 Rail Line – The I-225 Rail Line is a 10.5 mile extension of RTD’s existing light rail line from the Southeast Line Nine
Mile Station to the East Line commuter rail transfer point near the intersection of Peoria Street and Smith Road. The project includes
eight stations and will serve the Aurora City Center and the Anschutz/Fitzsimons Medical Campus. This line is planned to open for
revenue service in Winter 2016. In 2015, expenditures related to the I-225 Rail Line were $156,525.
FasTracks Southeast Rail Extension – The Southeast Rail Extension extends the popular Southeast Rail Line from Lincoln Station to
the new RidgeGate Parkway Interchange at I-25. The project will add 2.3 miles of light rail. New stations will be built at Sky Ridge
Medical Center, Lone Tree City Center and RidgeGate with a 1,300 space Park-n-Ride facility. In 2015, expenditures related to the
Southeast Rail Extension were $6,715. RTD has applied for a Small Starts Grant to fund the project.
Base Revenue Earning Equipment Transit Buses - RTD entered into a multiyear fixed price contract in 2013 with an option to
purchase up to 432 40’ low floor transit buses with Gillig LLC over a 5 year period. The new bus purchases will be replacing buses that
have exceeded their useful life. The transit buses are low floor handicap accessible. In 2015, expenditures related to the 40’ transit
buses were approximately $81,108.
Additional information on RTD’s capital assets can be found in note D of this report.

(18.5%) in 2014. The increase in both years 2015 and 2014 is due to new COPs issued for rail projects and well as replacement of rolling
stock.
Sales tax revenue bonds – RTD issues sales tax revenue bonds to fund the acquisition and construction of assets. The sales tax
revenue bonds were $2,013,220 and $1,955,657 as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The sales tax revenue bonds
increased $57,563 (2.9%) in 2015 compared to an increase of $60,477 (3.2%) in 2014. The increase in 2015 and 2014 is due to the
receipt of the TIFIA loan borrowings. The sales tax revenue bonds are payable from RTD’s sales and use tax revenue. RTD is required
to maintain certain minimum deposits, as defined in bond resolutions, to meet debt service requirements. The bonds may be redeemed
prior to maturity, at a price equal to the principal amount plus accrued interest thereon and a premium to the date of redemption.
Certificates of participation - Certificates of participation relate to financial obligations issued by the Asset Acquisition Authority,
Inc. (Authority), a nonprofit corporation. The Authority issued Certificates of Participation (Certificates) with the proceeds being used
to acquire certain equipment and facilities to be used by RTD. RTD leases the equipment acquired with the proceeds from the
Certificates under separate Master Lease Purchase Agreements. For financial reporting purposes, RTD accounts for the Certificates as
its own debt. Certificates outstanding were $1,230,860 and $1,064,855 as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The
Certificates outstanding increased $166,005 (15.6%) in 2015 compared to an increase of $409,625 (62.5%) in 2014. The increase in
2015 was due to the issuance of Certificates for the acquisition of equipment, buses and light rail vehicles. The increase in 2014 is due
to the issuance of Certificates for the construction of North Metro Rail Line.

Economic Factors and Subsequent Events after adoption of the 2015 Budget
RTD is dependent on sales and use taxes, which are the largest single source of revenue for RTD, representing 58.6% and 54.8% of the
total revenues in 2015 and 2014 respectively. Sales and use tax revenues are affected by the local economy in which changes will affect
the level of funding available to RTD during its fiscal year.
RTD is dependent on passenger fares collected for transit services provided. Passenger fares accounted for 13.0% and 12.8% of total
revenues in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Passenger fare collections may be affected by fare levels charged by RTD. In January 2016,
RTD implemented a fare increase and modification to fare products offered to customers.
RTD is dependent on federal and local grant funding for both operations and capital expenditures. Grants provided 26.2% and 30.0% of
total revenues in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Grant funding is only available for use by RTD for qualifying expenditures after
appropriation is made by the awarding agency.
Increases in operating expenditures are expected in 2016 due to the opening of four rail lines and bus rapid transit under the FasTracks
program. The FasTracks program is a plan to build a comprehensive, integrated region-wide transit network that will provide a reliable and
safe system, enhance mobility and respond to the growing transportation needs within the eight-county Regional Transportation District.
Additional FasTracks expansion projects are in various stages of completion with openings planned in future years.
RTD will issue revenue bonds in 2016 to provide a portion of the funding necessary to complete the Southeast Rail Line Extension as part
of the FasTracks expansion program. RTD plans to issue these bonds at a fixed interest rate and conventional terms. Outstanding bonds
and certificates of participation all have fixed interest rates and conventional terms in which debt service levels are not subject to
fluctuations in market interest rates, however, new issuances are subject to market interest rates at the time of issuance.

NOTE A – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
1. Organization
The Regional Transportation District (RTD) was created as a transportation planning agency, a political subdivision of
the State of Colorado, by an Act of the Colorado General Assembly (the Act), effective July 1969 (Title 32, Article 9,
C.R.S., 1973, as amended). In 1974, the Act was amended and RTD became an operating entity charged with the
responsibility for development, operation and maintenance of a public mass transportation system for the benefit of
the citizens of the District. The District is comprised of 15 separate districts located in Denver, Boulder, Broomfield
and Jefferson counties, and certain portions of Adams, Arapahoe, Douglas, and Weld counties.
RTD is governed by a publicly elected board of directors consisting of 15 members. Each board member is elected to
serve a term of four years by the constituents of the district in which the board member resides. As required by
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), these financial statements present RTD and its component unit.
The component unit discussed in note A.2 is included in the RTD’s reporting entity because of the significance of its
operational or financial relationship with the District.
In 1988, a Senate Bill was enacted (privatization legislation) requiring RTD to implement by March 31, 1989, a plan
to competitively bid contracts for the provision of at least 20% of RTD’s bus service by private contractors. In 1999,
the Bill was amended requiring RTD to increase this provision to at least 35% of fixed route bus service. In 2003, the
Bill was amended to require that at least 50% of RTD’s vehicular service be operated by private transit companies. In
May of 2007, the legislation was amended to provide for “a system under which up to 58% of the District’s service”
is provided by private contractors.
2. Financial Reporting Entity – Blended Component Unit
The Asset Acquisition Authority, Inc. (the Authority) was formed in 1987 as a nonprofit corporation on behalf of RTD
for the purpose of issuing certificates of participation in a public offering collateralized by an installment purchase
agreement with RTD. RTD’s General Manager appoints the Board of Directors of the Authority. The Authority serves
as a financing mechanism for various financing arrangements for RTD. RTD follows pronouncement 61 issued by the
Governmental Accounting Standards Board which provides guidance regarding the inclusion of component units in the
primary government’s financial statement presentation. The activity related to the underlying financial obligations of
the Authority has been included as a blended component unit in RTD’s financial statements for the years ended
December 31, 2015 and 2014. No separately audited financial statements are prepared for the Authority.
3. Basis of Accounting
The accounts of RTD are reported as a Proprietary Fund. Proprietary funds are accounted for on the flow of economic
resources measurement focus and use the accrual basis of accounting which reports all assets, deferred outflows of
resources, liabilities, deferred inflows of resources, revenues, expenses, gains and losses. Revenue is recognized when
earned and expenses are recorded at the time liabilities are incurred. Proprietary funds distinguish operating revenues
and expenses from non-operating items. Operating revenues and expenses generally result from providing services and
producing and delivering goods in connection with a proprietary fund’s principal ongoing operations. The principal
operating revenues of RTD are charges to customers for services. Operating expenses include the cost of services,
administrative expenses and asset depreciation. All revenues and expenses not meeting this definition are reported as
non-operating revenues and expenses.
It is RTD’s policy to apply GAAP in its presentation of financial statements. When both restricted and unrestricted
resources are available for use, it is RTD’s policy to use restricted resources first, then unrestricted resources as they
are needed.

NOTE A – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
4. Cash Equivalents
RTD considers all highly liquid investments, both restricted and unrestricted, with an original maturity of three
months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
5. Interest Bearing Investments
Investments with a maturity date, when purchased, of less than one year are carried at cost or amortized cost which
approximates fair value. Investments with a maturity date of more than one year from the date of purchase are
carried at fair value.
6. Inventories
Inventories consist primarily of materials and supplies used in the ordinary course of operations. Materials and
supplies are stated at cost using the FIFO (first-in, first-out) method.
7. Other Current Assets
Certain payments to vendors reflect costs applicable to future accounting periods and are recorded as prepaid items.
Escrows are deposits held in escrow during the period of construction. At the time projects are completed, escrows
are generally applied toward the cost of the project or may be forfeited by RTD upon breach of contract.
8. Receivables
Accounts receivable are stated at the amount management expects to collect from outstanding balances.
Management provides for probable uncollected amounts through a charge to earnings and a credit to a valuation
allowance based on its assessment of the current status of individual accounts. Balances that are still outstanding
after management has used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the valuation allowance
and a credit to accounts receivable. Changes in the valuation allowance have not been material to the consolidated
financial statements.
9. Restricted Assets
Restricted assets are assets restricted by the covenants of long-term financial arrangements.
10. Capital Assets
Property and equipment are stated at historical cost. Capital assets are defined by RTD as assets with an initial,
individual cost of more than $5,000 and an estimated useful life in excess of one year. Maintenance and repairs are
charged to current period operating expenses and improvements are capitalized. Upon retirement or other disposition
of property and equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts
and any gains or losses are included in non-operating revenue and expense. A pro rata share of proceeds from the sale
of property and equipment, which were acquired with federal funds, is required to be invested in a similar asset.
Interest is capitalized on assets financed with debt or certificates of participation from the date of the borrowing
until completion of the project. The amount of tax-exempt and taxable debt and certificates of participation
(externally restricted) interest to be capitalized is the difference between the interest expense and interest earnings
on issuance proceeds. The amount of other interest to be capitalized is calculated by weighted average construction
expenditures multiplied by the weighted average interest rate of the outstanding obligations.

11. Depreciation
Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of
the assets, which are as follows:
Land improvements
Buildings
Revenue earning equipment
Shop, maintenance and other equipment

10–20 years
30 years
8–25 years
3–10 years

Fully depreciated assets, which are still in use, are included in the asset balances in the accompanying financial
statements. The cost of fully depreciated assets was approximately $370,683 and $446,561 at December 31, 2015
and 2014, respectively.
12. Deferred Outflows/Inflows of Resources
In addition to assets, the statement of financial position will sometimes report a separate section for deferred
outflow of resources. This separate financial statement element, deferred outflows of resources, represents a
consumption of net position that applies to a future period(s) and thus, will not be recognized as an outflow of
resources (expense/expenditure) until then. RTD’s deferred outflows were $77,736 and $39,736 as of December 31,
2015 and 2014, respectively.
In addition to liabilities, the statement of financial position will sometimes report a separate section for deferred
inflows of resources. This separate financial statement element, deferred inflows of resources, represents an
acquisition of net position that applies to a future period(s) and so will not be recognized as an inflow of resources
(revenue) until that time. RTD’s deferred inflows were $4,701 and $627 as of December 31, 2015 and 2014,
respectively.
13. Compensated Absences
RTD employees receive compensation for vacations, holidays, illness, and certain other qualifying absences. The
number of days compensated in the various categories of absence is based generally on length of service.
Compensated absences, which have been earned but not paid, have been accrued in the accompanying financial
statements.
14. Self-Insurance
Liabilities for property damage and personal injury are recognized as incurred on the basis of the estimated cost to
RTD. In addition, RTD offers a self-insured health benefit option as part of its employee benefits program in which
costs are recognized as they are incurred.

NOTE A – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
15. Revenue Recognition
Passenger Fares
Passenger fares are recorded as revenue at the time services are performed and revenue is collected from the
farebox. Sales of monthly passes are recorded initially as unearned revenue and recognized as income at the end of
the month for which the pass is used. Sale of ten ride and day pass tickets is recorded as income at the time of sale.
Sales of college based passes, which are valid for a specific academic semester, are recorded initially as unearned
revenue. Sales are recognized as income at the end of each month, with the amount recognized in each month
determined by prorating the total contract amount over the semesters/quarters covered. Sales of Eco Pass and
Neighborhood Pass, which are valid through December 31 of a given year, are recorded initially as unearned revenue.
Sales are recognized as income at the end of each month, with the total contract amount prorated evenly over the
number of months of the contract.
Sales and Use Taxes
Under the provisions of the Act, as amended, RTD levies a sales tax of 1.0% on net taxable sales made within the
District and a use tax of 1.0% on items purchased for use inside the District. As described in Note E, under the terms
of the Sales Tax Revenue Bonds, Series 2007A, Series 2010A, Series 2010B, Series 2012A, Series 2013 bond
resolutions, and TIFIA Sales Tax Loan, sales and use tax revenue is pledged for payment of debt service. Sales and
use taxes are collected by the State of Colorado, Department of Revenue and are remitted to a trustee who satisfies
debt service from the collections, as required under RTD’s bond and commercial paper resolutions, and remits the
balance to RTD.
Sales and use taxes are recorded as revenue by RTD in the month collected by the merchant. Sales and Use Tax
Bonds debt service will be paid from the collateralized sales and use revenues in the amount of approximately
$3,017,352 through 2050. Principal and interest paid for the current year and pledged revenues received were
$98,533.
Grants and Local Contributions
RTD receives grants from the federal government, through the Federal Transit Administration (FTA). Grants are also
awarded to RTD by state of Colorado through the Colorado Department of Transportation. The federal and state
government issues grants to RTD for operations and acquisition of property and equipment.
The amount recorded as capital grants was $157,616 and $171,549 in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Operating
assistance grant revenue was $73,383 and $75,544 in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Other contribution revenue
was $11,697 and $34,882 in 2015 and 2014, respectively.
Grants and local contributions are recorded as revenue by RTD once all applicable eligibility requirements are met.
16. Use of Estimates
The financial statements contained herein have been prepared in accordance with US Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles (GAAP). GAAP are uniform minimum standards of and guidelines to financial accounting and
reporting. GAAP establishes appropriate measurement and classification criteria for financial reporting. Adherence to
GAAP provides a reasonable degree of comparability among the financial reports of state and local governmental
units. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP involves the use of management’s estimates.
These estimates are based upon management’s best judgments, after considering past and current events and
assumptions about future events. Actual results may differ from estimates.

17. Pensions
For purposes of measuring the net pension liability, deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of resources
related to pensions, and pension expense, information about the pension plan’s fiduciary net position and additions
to/deductions from the plan’s fiduciary net position have been determined on the same basis as they are reported by
the plan. For this purpose, benefit payments (including refunds of employee contributions) are recognized when due
and payable in accordance with the benefit terms. Investments are reported at fair value.
18. GASB 68 – Classification
During the year ended December 31, 2015, RTD implemented the provisions of GASB Statement No.68 (GASB 68),
Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions, as amended by GASB Statement No. 71, Pension Transition for
Contributions Made Subsequent to the Measurement Date. GASB 68 requires governments providing defined benefit
pensions to recognize the long-term obligation for pension benefits as a liability, and to more comprehensively and
comparably measure the annual costs of pension benefits. This Statement also enhances accountability and
transparency through revised note disclosures and new required supplementary information.
19. Reinstatement of Prior Year Net Position
Net Position has been restated as required by implementation of GASB 68 as discussed in note 18 above.

NOTE B – DEPOSITS AND INVESTMENTS
Deposits
RTD’s deposits are subject to the State of Colorado’s Public Deposit Protection Act (PDPA). Under this act, all uninsured
public deposits at qualified institutions are fully collateralized with pledged collateral which is held in custody by any
Federal Reserve Bank or branch thereof, or held in escrow by some other bank in a manner as the banking Commissioner
shall prescribe by rule and regulation, or may be segregated from the other assets of the eligible public depository and held
in its own trust department. Colorado’s PDPA requires that pledged collateral to be held is clearly identified as being
security maintained or pledged for the aggregate amount of public deposits accepted and held on deposit by the eligible
public depository. The depository has the right at any time to make substitutions of eligible collateral maintained or
pledged and is at all times entitled to collect and retain all income derived from those investments without restrictions.
As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, RTD had bank deposits of $44,367 and $43,749 collateralized with
securities held by the pledging financial institutions’ trust department or agent but not in RTD’s name.

In the event that one or more nationally recognized statistical rating agency rates such Agency obligations below the highest rating category, but no
lower than one of the two highest rating categories, RTD’s funds may continue to be invested in Agencies if such investments satisfy the requirements

(m) (II) shall not apply. Rather, the diversification limit shall be set as follows: no more than 75% of the portfolio may be invested in Agencies, with any
more than 25% being invested in any one Agency.

Proceeds from the issuance of RTD’s obligations are invested in accordance with legal documentation governing the

In prior years, RTD defeased certain obligations by placing the proceeds of new obligations in an irrevocable trust to provide
for all future service payments on the old obligations. Accordingly, the trust account assets and the liability for the defeased
obligations are not included in these financial statements. Outstanding as of December 31, 2015 are the following amounts

In January 2015, RTD drew the final $75,000 and recognized $9,001 of capitalized interest from the Transportation
Infrastructure and Innovation Act (TIFIA) loan. Under the TIFIA loan authorization, RTD drew a total of $280,000 in 2013
thru 2015 and recognized $16,284 of capitalized interest. The draws from the TIFIA loan were used to pay for “Eligible
Project Costs” on RTD’s Eagle Project. The interest rate on the TIFIA loan is 3.14% with interest payments anticipated to
begin in 2021 and final maturity expected in 2045. The TIFIA loan will be used to complement the other sources of debt,
resulting in a lower cost of funding than would have otherwise been available in the capital markets. The first TIFIA draw of
$125,000 was made in 2013. The TIFIA loan is secured by a pledge of RTD’s 0.4% FasTracks sales and use tax.

ATU 1001 Pension Plan – Defined Benefit
Plan Description
The Regional Transportation District and Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1001 Pension Plan was established pursuant to
collective bargaining agreements between RTD and the Union. This plan covers substantially all full-time union-represented
employees in accordance with the union agreement. The plan is a single-employer defined benefit pension plan administered
by Compusys, Inc.
Benefits Provided
All benefits are paid in the form of a 50% joint and survivor annuity unless this form is rejected by the participant and the
spouse.
Normal retirement benefits under the Plan are paid to participants who have attained age 65 and have been with the Plan for
ten years. The benefit amount is based on final average earnings, years of employment under this Plan and age at date of
retirement.
Early retirement, effective January 1, 1992, any Participant who has accumulated 20 or more years of credited service and
terminated employment prior to attaining age 50, will be entitled to an early retirement benefit starting on the first day of
any month after he has attained age 50. The Plan was amended effective January 1, 2011. The years of credited service
needed to qualify for a normal retirement benefit was increased from five to ten years and the benefit multiplier for both the
normal and early retirement was revised.
Death benefits state if an Employee, who is not eligible for a vested benefit or not eligible to retire, should die, his beneficiary
will be paid the accumulated employee contributions plus interest. Upon the death of a pensioner, a funeral benefit of $2,000
will be paid in a lump sum to the pensioners designated beneficiary

Disability benefits, an individual who becomes totally disabled prior to age 65 and retires from active employment with RTD
as a direct result of being totally disabled is entitled to a disability retirement benefit provided he has worked for at least ten
years for RTD in covered employment or any of its predecessors. An individual will be considered totally disabled upon
receipt of a disability award from Social Security. Effective January 1, 2011 the years of credited service needed to qualify
for a disability benefit was increased from five to ten years and the benefit multiplier was revised.
Deferred Vested Retirement Benefit, an individual who terminated employment on or after January 1, 1993, for any reason
other than retirement, will be entitled to a deferred vested benefit at age 65 provided he had worked for at least ten years in
covered employment for RTD or any of its predecessors. A participant is entitled to deferred, vested benefits as early as age
50 if he has worked for at least 20 years in covered employment and terminates active employment on or after attaining age
50. If an individual with 20 or more years of service terminated employment prior to age 50, benefits will be payable at any
time after age 50. Effective January 1, 2011 the years of credited service needed to qualify for a deferred vested retirement
disability benefit was increased from five to ten years and the benefit multiplier was revised.
Benefit structure for participants hired on or after January 1, 2011. The following changes are included:
•
•
•
•
•
•

The benefit multiplier is changed from 2.5% to 1% with a new benefit schedule. (Priority 1).
Regular retirement is changed from age 55 with 20 years of service to age 60 with 20 years of service.
Sick and vacation payouts are no longer included in the pension benefit calculation. (Priority 2).
Vesting is changed from 5 years to 10 years.
Interest on employee contributions is changed from 5% to 3%.
The maximum service included in the benefit calculation is reduced from 30 years to 25 years. (Priority 3).

A “Trigger Policy” has also been provided that will partially rescind the modified benefit structure when certain Plan funding
benchmarks are achieved. If the total Actuarial Required Contribution (ARC) is less than 11% of payroll, pension benefits
would be restored in the order of priority listed above. The "Trigger" remains in effect until such time as the 11% ARC is
restored.

Single Discount Rate
Projected benefit payments are required to be discounted to their actuarial present values using a Single Discount Rate that
reflects (1) a long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments (to the extent that the plan’s fiduciary net
position is projected to be sufficient to pay benefits) and (2) tax-exempt municipal bond rate based on an index of 20-year
general obligation bonds with an average AA credit rating as of the measurement date (to the extent that the plan’s
projected fiduciary net position is not sufficient to pay benefits). For the purpose of this valuation, the expected rate of
return on pension plan investments is 7.00%; the municipal bond rate is 3.65% (based on the weekly rate closest to but not
later than the measurement date of the “state & local bonds” rate from Federal Reserve statistical release(H.15)); and the
resulting Single Discount Rate is 5.00%.

Actuarial Assumptions
The total pension liability was determined by an actuarial valuation with date of January 1, 2014, using the following
actuarial assumptions applied to all periods included in the measurement with a liability roll forward to December 31, 2014
for disclosure purposes for the Fiscal Year Ending December 31, 2015:
Inflation
Salary Increases
Investment Rate of Return

3.00%
3.75% - 8.75%
7.50%, net of investment expenses

The long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments was determined using a building-block method in
which best- estimate ranges of expected future real rates of return (expected returns, net of pension plan investment
expense and inflation) are developed for each major asset class. These ranges are combined to produce the long-term
expected rate of return by weighting the expected future real rates of return by the target asset allocation percentage
including expected inflation. Best estimates of arithmetic real rates of return for each major asset class included in the
pension plan’s target asset allocation as of the December 31, 2014 measurement date.

study covering the period January 1, 2009 - December 31, 2013.

Discount Rate
The discount rate used to measure the total pension liability was 7.50%. The projection of cash flows used to determine
the discount rate assumed that RTD contributions will be equal to the actuarially determined contribution rate for the
applicable fiscal years. Based on those assumptions, the pension plan’s fiduciary net position was projected to be
available to make all projected future benefit payments of current plan members. Therefore, the long-term expected rate
of return on pension plan investments was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine the total
pension liability.

Defined Benefit Plan Descriptions – 2014 Presentation Prior GASB 68 Implementation
RTD maintains two single-employer defined benefit pension plans. The Regional Transportation District Salaried Employees’
Pension Plan (the RTD Plan) covers all non-union, full-time salaried employees whom were hired prior to January 1, 2008.
The Regional Transportation District and Amalgamated Transit Union Division 1001 Pension Plan (the Union Plan) was
established pursuant to collective bargaining agreements between RTD and the Union. This plan covers substantially all fulltime union-represented employees in accordance with the union agreement. The Board of Directors of each plan has the
authority for establishing and amending benefits and funding policy. Each plan is administered by a pension board and issues
audited financial statements, which include financial information for that plan. Those financial statements may be obtained
from the plan:

Aurora, Colorado 80014-2602

The RTD Plan provides retirement benefits to RTD salaried employees who retire at or after age 55 with at least five years
of service. These employees are entitled to a single lump sum distribution or an annual retirement benefit, payable monthly
for life. The normal retirement benefit is equal to 2.5% of average final compensation to which a participant is entitled on
the day the participant retires, multiplied by the number of years of credited service. The RTD Board adopted amendment No.
8, effective January 1, 2008, in which salaried employee new hires shall not be eligible to participate in the RTD Plan.
The Union Plan provides retirement benefits to employees who retire at or after a certain age with at least a specified
number of years of service. These employees are entitled to a percentage of their final average earnings based on age and
credited service at retirement.

Funding Policy
Contributions to the RTD Plan are actuarially determined. RTD employees are not required to contribute to the RTD Plan.
Contributions to the Union Plan are made in accordance with the collective bargaining agreement. This agreement requires
RTD to contribute 8% and the employee to contribute 3% of the employee’s qualifying wages. Effective March 1, 2013 RTD
is to contribute 12% and the employee to contribute 4%. RTD has no liability to the Union Plan beyond its contributions.
Funding Status
Based on actuarial valuations performed as of January 1, 2014, the RTD Plan had unfunded actuarial accrued liabilities of
$19,890 and the Union Plan had unfunded actuarial accrued liabilities of $218,837. The actuarial value of assets for both
plans is determined by spreading gains and losses over a five-year period.

RTD Plan – Defined Contribution
Plan Description
The RTD defined contribution plan and represents full-time salaried employees hired after January 1, 2008. The RTD Board
adopted amendment No. 8, effective January 1, 2008. RTD contributes 9% of the employee’s qualifying wage. Contributions
totaled $2,870 and $2,394 in 2015 and 2014, respectively. RTD employees cannot contribute to the Plan. Membership was
474 and 392 active employees in 2015 and 2014, respectively. In addition, RTD has one employee in 2015 and 2014
participating in both the RTD plan and the RTD DC Plan due to a compensation level in excess of the 2015-2014
compensation limits imposed under IRC section 401(a) (17).
Amalgamated Transit Union Division 1001 Health and Welfare Trust
The Amalgamated Transit Union Division 1001 Health and Welfare Trust was formed pursuant to a Trust Agreement
effective July 1, 1971, between Amalgamated Transit Union Division 1001 (ATU 1001) and an agent of a transit enterprise
owned by the City and County of Denver, through July 3, 1974, and the Regional Transportation District (RTD) thereafter.
In addition to the original Denver Metro Division, employees of other RTD divisions have been approved for participation in
the Trust benefits. The Trust agreement shall continue in full force and effect in all its terms and provisions so long as there
continues to be a collective bargaining agreement between the Union and RTD.
The Trust provides health benefits (hospital, medical, dental, vision, life and short-term disability) for represented employees
of RTD and certain officers of ATU 1001 and health care benefits for retired employees actively working 600 hours or more
per quarter. The Trust is funded through contribution by the employer and employee, the share of benefit plan contributions
is set by the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA). RTD’s contribution was $16,846 and $13,878 for the years ended
December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Trust also provides insurance coverage for felonious assault for each
employee and funds the Amalgamated Transit Union Division 1001 Legal Services Trust. The Trust self-insures part of its
health benefits, life insurance coverage and short-term disability. The plan issues audited financial statements, which include
financial information for the plan. The financial statements may be obtained from the plan; RTD ATU 1001 Health and
Welfare Trust, 2821 S. Parker Road, Suite 215 Aurora, Colorado 80014-2602.
Unearned Compensation Plan
RTD offers its employees an unearned compensation plan (the Plan), created in accordance with Internal Revenue Code
Section 457, which is available to substantially all employees and permits them to defer a portion of their compensation to
future years. Under the terms of the Plan, the unearned compensation is available to participants upon termination,
retirement, death or in the event of an unforeseeable emergency or other financial hardship.
Compensated Absences
RTD considers all accrued compensated absences as due within one year. Employees accrue paid time off (PTO), vacation,
and sick leave based on time in service; employees are not allowed to accumulate more than twice their annual PTO or
vacation accrual and sick leave based on years of service. Employees are paid any outstanding compensated absence
balances upon leaving RTD. RTD records these accrued compensated absences as current liabilities under the principle of
conservatism by assuming these amounts are the most RTD would be obligated to pay in the near-term.

Operating Lease – Purchased Transportation
RTD has entered into a number of transactions in which certain of its light rail vehicles have been leased to and subleased
back from certain U.S. and foreign companies and has entered into a transaction in which its maintenance facilities have
been leased to and subleased back. As part of these transactions, RTD irrevocably set aside certain monies (which were
received from each counter party as payment for its leasing of light rail vehicles and real property) with a third party trustee.
The monies held by such trustees will be utilized to make the lease payments owed by the RTD under the transactions and
are therefore considered fully funded and economically defeased.
Capital Projects
As of December 31, 2015, RTD has contracts for the construction of various capital projects and the purchase of buses and
light rail vehicles. The costs to complete these projects and the purchase of buses/light rail vehicles total $461,864 and
$483,272 in 2015 and 2014, respectively.
Grant Match Requirements
Under the provisions of current grants, RTD is obligated to satisfy certain matching requirements of these grants. At
December 31, 2015, RTD had a commitment to provide $20,329 in matching funds in order to receive $66,374 in future
federal and state grant funds.

Privatization Contracts
In response to the privatization legislation (Note A), RTD has awarded contracts for specific groups of routes, not to exceed
58% as required by law for vehicular services. As of January 2016, slightly over 54.33% of RTD’s non-rail transit services
are delivered by private contractors operating under the auspices and direction of RTD.
ADA Paratransit Service
With the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), RTD was mandated to provide paratransit service to
the disabled individuals unable to use RTD’s fixed route buses, operating the same days and hours of service as the fixed
route service. This service, called Access-a-Ride, is a curb-to-curb (with door-to-door assistance upon special request)
transportation system offered to disabled individuals who cannot functionally use RTD’s regular fixed route system.
Passengers eligible for Access-a-Ride service must originate their trip within 3/4 of a mile of an RTD non-commuter fixed
route. Since September 1996, RTD has been in full compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990
requirement to provide paratransit service to the disabled individuals unable to use fixed route buses.
Future Commitments under Construction Contracts
In 2010, RTD entered into a public-private partnership to design, build, finance and operate several of the transit
improvements contemplated under the FasTracks program, including the Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility, the East
Corridor, the Gold Line Rail Corridor and the electrified segment of the Northwest Rail Corridor (together, the “Eagle P3
Project). The Eagle P3 Project is being delivered and operated under a concession agreement that RTD has entered into with
a concessionaire that has been selected through a competitive proposal process. The selected concessionaire is known as
Denver Transit Partners (DTP), a special purpose company owned by Fluor Enterprises, Uberior Investments and Laing
Investments.
The Eagle P3 Project construction will be completed in two phases with Phase I completed in 2016 and Phase II completed
in 2017. Under the terms of the Eagle P3 Project agreement, RTD will make scheduled construction payments to DTP each
year from 2011 through 2017 for completed project elements totaling $1,064,592. RTD will assume ownership of the Eagle
P3 Project elements as they are constructed. In addition, RTD will make scheduled secured principal and interest payments
to DTP from 2017 through 2044 for the remaining Eagle P3 Project obligation totaling $1,438,234 resulting in a total
project cost through 2044 of $2,502,826. The Eagle P3 Project agreement also includes a provision whereby, upon project
completion and placement in service, DTP will operate and maintain the Eagle P3 Project during the period 2016 through
2044 for which RTD will make service payments.
In 2012, RTD entered a contract with Kiewit Infrastructure Company to complete the 10.5 mile I-225 light rail line,
extending from the currently existing Nine Mile station to connect the Southeast Line to the East Line. The I-225 Line is
being completed in coordination with the Colorado Department of Transportation’s I-225 highway project and will open in
2016 to provide connectivity to major activity centers like the Aurora City Center, Anschutz/Fitzsimons Medical Center and
Denver International Airport through a transfer at Peoria to the East Rail Line.
In December 2013, RTD entered a contract with Regional Rail Partners to construct the North Metro Rail Line. The North
Metro Rail Line is an 18.5-mile electric commuter rail line that will run from Denver Union Station through Commerce City,
Thornton and Northglenn to Highway 7 at 162nd Avenue in North Adams County. The North Metro Rail Line is scheduled to
open in 2018.

Contingencies
Federal Grants
RTD receives federal grants for capital projects and operating assistance, which are subject to audit by FTA. Although the
outcome of any such audit cannot be predicted, it is management’s opinion these audits will not result in liabilities to such an
extent that they would materially affect RTD’s financial position.
Self-Insurance
RTD is self-insured for general liability and Workers’ Compensation claims. Liabilities are reported when it is probable that a
loss has occurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In addition, RTD offers a self-insured health
benefit option as part of its employee benefits program in which costs are recognized as they are incurred.
RTD does not carry excess liability insurance for personal injury and property damage. Under the provisions of the Colorado
Government Immunity Act, the maximum liability, with certain exceptions as defined in the Act, to RTD for claims involving
personal injury and property damage is $350 per individual and $990 per incident.
For Workers’ Compensation, an excess coverage insurance policy covers individual claims in excess of $2,000. The amount
of settlements has not exceeded insurance coverage in any of the past three years.
RTD’s liability for unpaid claims includes an amount for claims that have been incurred but not reported (IBNR). RTD’s Risk
Management determines incurred claims by investigating the accident and establishing a reserve. Reserves are established
on the day of assignment, reviewed at 30 days and again at 90 days. Reserves are reviewed every 90 days thereafter and
based on ultimate exposure. This amount is included in other accrued expenses in the statement of net assets. Changes in
the balances of claims liabilities for both general liability and Worker’s Compensation during the past year are as follows:

NOTE H – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (CONTINUED)
Contract Disputes and Legal Proceedings
RTD is party to a number of pending or threatened lawsuits under which it may be required to pay certain amounts upon final
disposition of these matters. RTD’s legal counsel estimates that the ultimate outcome of these matters is either sufficiently
covered by RTD’s general liability and Workers’ Compensation reserves or would not materially affect the financial
statements of RTD.
RTD has been made aware of a pending lawsuit in which the claimant is seeking a refund from the Department of Revenue
of previously paid sales taxes on purchases of aviation fuel as well as the discontinuance of such future sales tax payments.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has recently issued guidance regarding state and local taxation of aviation fuel in
which RTD may no longer be authorized to collect such taxes and possibly refund some taxes previously collected.
RTD is party to a pending lawsuit in which the plaintiffs/appellants seek to hold unconstitutional a 2013 state statute which
made several adjustments to the items upon which RTD and the Scientific and Cultural Facilities District could and could not
collect sales tax. The appellants maintained that voter approval was required. The District Court granted summary judgment
in favor of RTD and the other appellees (SCFD and the Colorado Department of Revenue). The matter is currently before the
Colorado Court of Appeals. If the District Court’s decision is reversed, RTD may no longer be authorized to collect certain
taxes and may possibly have to refund some taxes previously collected.

NOTE J – BUDGETARY DATA
RTD’s annual budget is prepared on the same basis as that used for accounting except that the budget also includes
proceeds of long-term debt and capital grants as revenue and expenditures include capital outlays and bond principal
payments, and excludes TABOR rebates under Amendment One, extraordinary loss and depreciation on, as well as gains and
losses on disposition of, property and equipment. The budget sets forth all proposed outlays for operations, planning,
administration, development, debt service, and capital outlays for the fiscal year. Prior to October 15, the General Manager
submits to the Board of Directors a proposed operating and capital budget for the fiscal year commencing the following
January 1, which is made available for public inspection and comment. On or before December 31, the budget is adopted in
conjunction with an appropriation resolution by the Board of Directors, who must also approve subsequent amendments
thereto. In the absence of such adoption, RTD has authority to begin making expenditures limited to 90% of the prior year’s
approved appropriation. RTD’s policy on budget transfers authorizes the General Manager to approve certain transfers
within the budget.
A reconciliation for the years ended December 31 of the annual budget, as amended, to actual revenue and expenses is as
follows:

Revenue, actual
Proceeds from debt / arbitrage relief
Federal capital grants and local contributions
Revenue, actual (budgetary basis)
Revenue, budget
Expenses, actual
Capital outlays
Depreciation, amortization, other
Long-term debt principal payment

Unused appropriations lapse at year-end, except the Board of Directors has the authority, as stated in the adopted
appropriation resolution, to carry over the unused portion of funds for capital projects not completed, for a period not to
exceed three years. As of December 31, 2015, there was approximately $1,004 of unused 2015 appropriations for capital
outlays available for carryover to 2016.
NOTE K – TAX, SPENDING AND DEBT LIMITATIONS
In November 1992, Colorado voters passed an amendment (Amendment One) to the State Constitution (Article X, Section
20) that limits the revenue raising and spending abilities of state and local governments known as the Taxpayer’s Bill of
Rights (TABOR). The limits on property taxes, revenue, and “fiscal year spending” include allowable annual increases tied to
inflation and local growth in construction valuation. Fiscal year spending as defined by the amendment excludes spending
from certain revenue and financing sources such as federal funds, gifts, property sales, fund transfers, damage awards, and
fund reserves (balances). The amendment requires voter approval for any increase in mill levy tax rates, new taxes, or
creation of multi-year debt. Revenue earned in excess of the “spending limit” must be refunded to the taxpayers unless
voters approve retention of these revenues. In addition, the amendment mandates that reserves equal 3% of fiscal spending
be established for declared emergencies.

NOTE K – TAX, SPENDING AND DEBT LIMITATIONS (CONTINUED)
On November 7, 1995, the voters of the District exempted the Regional Transportation District from the revenue and
spending limitations concerning the Amendment through December 31, 2005. On November 2, 1999, the voters of the
District further exempted RTD from the revenue and spending limitations outlined in the Amendment for the purpose of
paying any debt incurred to finance the Southeast Corridor light rail project or to operate such project for as long as any debt
remains outstanding, but in no event beyond December 31, 2026.
On November 2, 2004, the voters of the District authorized an increase in RTD’s sales and use tax rate from 0.6% to 1.0%,
effective January 1, 2005, to finance the FasTracks transit improvement program. This authorization also exempted RTD
from any revenue and spending limitations on the additional tax and on any investment income generated by the increased
tax revenue, and allowed RTD to incur debt to finance the capital improvements included in the FasTracks program. At the
time that all FasTracks debt is repaid, RTD’s sales and use tax rate will be reduced to a rate sufficient to operate the rapid
transit system financed through FasTracks. RTD has $3.477 billion in authorized debt, subject to the Amendments’
limitations. This debt was authorized by the voters of the District in 2004 to pay for the FasTracks rapid transit
improvement program. Based on estimated fiscal year spending for 2015, $20,284 of year-end net position, as restated,
has been reserved for emergencies.
The Amendment is complex and subject to judicial interpretation. RTD believes it is in compliance with the requirements of
the Amendment based on the interpretations of the Amendment’s language available at year-end.
NOTE L – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
On January 1, 2016, RTD implemented a fare structure modification. The modification was the culmination of a two year
task force fare study with the goals of simplification, equity and the achievement of revenue levels set out in the Strategic
Budget Plan.
On January 1, 2016, the RTD Board of Directors contracted with the RTD Interim General Manager and CEO for three years
plus two option years to serve as the permanent RTD General Manager and CEO.
On January 3, 2016, RTD began Bus Rapid Transit service along U.S. 36 between downtown Denver and Boulder as part of
the FasTracks Project.
On April 22, 2016, RTD began Commuter Rail service on the East Line between downtown Denver and Denver International
Airport as part of the FasTracks Project.

performed in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards
applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the
United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement and presented in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit
evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. We also assessed the accounting principles
used by RTD and the reasonableness of significant estimates made by RTD’s management, as well as evaluated the
overall financial statement presentation.
Auditing standards require the auditor to ensure that those charged with governance receive additional information
regarding the scope and results of the audit that may assist the governing body in overseeing the financial reporting
and disclosure process for which management is responsible. The following section describes matters which are
required to be reported to you.

Our Responsibility Under U.S. Generally Accepted
Auditing Standards, Government Auditing Standards
And The Uniform Guidance

Reports issued by RubinBrown:
Unmodified report on RTD’s financial statements based
upon an audit of the financial statements in accordance
with auditing standards generally accepted in the United
States of America and Governmental Auditing Standards
RTD agreed-upon procedures reports regarding National
Transit Database reporting
Consulting engagement to determine the cost of the RTD
GM contract
A report on RTD’s internal control over financial reporting
and compliance and other matters based upon an audit of
the financial statements in accordance with Governmental
Auditing Standards
A unmodified report on RTD’s compliance for each major
program and a report on internal control over compliance
and report on the schedule of expenditures of federal
awards in accordance with the Uniform Guidance

Our responsibility, as described by professional standards, is to
express an opinion about whether the financial statements
prepared by management with your assistance are fairly
presented, in all material respects, in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and whether
RTD complied in all material respects with the applicable
compliance requirements of its major federal programs. Our
audit of the financial statements and compliance does not
relieve you or management of responsibility for the accuracy of
the financial statements and/or compliance with applicable
requirements.
Professional standards also require that we obtain a significant
understanding of RTD’s internal control to plan the audit.
However, such understanding is required for the purpose of
determining our audit procedures and not to provide any
assurance concerning such internal control. Accordingly, we
express no such assurance.

Planned Scope And Timing Of The Audit

We performed the audit according to the planned scope and
timing communicated in our letter dated March 8, 2016
regarding the timing and extent of our audit procedures.

Qualitative Aspects Of Accounting Practices
Management is responsible for the selection and use of
appropriate accounting policies. In accordance with the terms
of our engagement letter, we will advise management about the
appropriateness of accounting policies and their application.

Significant accounting policies are described in Note A.
No new accounting policies were adopted, and the
application of existing policies was not changed, except
for the following:
Governmental Accounting Standards Board
(GASB) 68: Accounting and Financial Reporting for
Pensions and GASB 71: Pension Transition for
Contributions Made Subsequent to the
Measurement Date - an amendment of GASB
Statement No. 68 (GASB 68)
We noted no transactions entered into during the year for
which there was a lack of authoritative guidance or
consensus.
No significant transactions have been recognized in a
different period than when the transactions occurred.

Management Judgments And Accounting
Estimates
The preparation of the financial statements requires
the use of accounting estimates. Certain estimates
are particularly sensitive due to their significance to
the financial statements and the possibility that future
events may differ significantly from management’s
expectations.

Financial Statement Disclosures

We evaluated the key factors and assumptions used to develop the
estimates in determining that they are reasonable in relation to the
financial statements taken as a whole. The most sensitive estimates
affecting the financial statements are:
Management’s estimate of depreciation is based upon estimated
useful lives of capital assets.
Management’s estimate of the allowance for bad debts is based on
management’s review of outstanding receivables.
Management’s estimate of the net pension liability is based on
actuarial valuations and employee census data.
The disclosures are neutral, consistent and clear. Certain disclosures are
particularly sensitive because of their significance to financial statement
users. The most sensitive disclosures affecting the financial statements
are:
The disclosure of capital assets in Note D
The disclosure of long-term debt in Note E
The disclosure of employee retirement and unearned compensation
plans in Note F
The disclosure of commitments and contingencies in Note H
The disclosure of the tax, spending and debt limitations in Note K

Status
Implemented

The TIFIA loan agreement specified a funding period (period of availability), which
is the period of time when eligible project costs can be incurred for potential
reimbursement under the program. The TIFIA loan agreement specified eligible
federal project costs were for work performed after November 6, 2009. RTD
submitted reimbursement requests that included expenditures outside of the period
of availability and, as a result, incurred questioned costs of approximately
$1.5 million. RTD has identified other eligible project costs that meet the period of
availability and is in the process of amending the related reimbursement requests.
The TIFIA program is a federally funded loan, which is not a typical federal funding
arrangement that RTD has encountered previously; therefore, the loan program
reimbursements were not subjected to the same internal controls as federally
funded reimbursement grants. We recommended that the RTD Grant Accountant
prepare all reimbursement requests for all federal funds including both grant and
federal loan programs.

Recode Of Transactions (Recurring):

MANAGEMENT RESPONSE
Partially implemented

RTD regularly recodes transactions to allocate expenditures:
From a general project to a specific task within the project
From one federal source to another
From one project to another
From local sources to federal sources
The recodes occur for various reasons not limited to correcting errors, utilizing
different funding sources or refining/finalizing the accounting for a project. The
recode entries are created by the budget analyst and reapproved by the individuals
who approved the original transactions. The Accounting Manager then reviews and
approves posting of the entry. While the Accounting Manager will consult with the
FasTracks Program Control Manager or the Chief Financial Officer, depending on
the nature and sensitivity of the recode, there is no other formal documentation
regarding approval of the recode. We recommended that management continue to
enhance the policy whereby recodes that meet certain quantitative or qualitative
characteristics, such as a change in funding source or project, be approved by the
Program Control Manager or other appropriate designated individual.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

From:

Date:

May 18, 2016

Subject:

Salaried Employee Trustee Replacement

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: May 18, 2016
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: May 31, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the attached Resolution No. ______ amending the Salaried Employee Defined Benefit (i.e.,
Pension) Plan and Salaried Employee Defined Contribution Plan to provide for appointment of the same
four employee trustees for each of the plans, with two trustees being employee participants in the
Pension Plan, and two being employee participants in the Defined Contribution Plan. The resolution
further provides that the three existing employee trustees serving both plans remain as trustees with
revised termination dates to assure continued staggered terms, and that a fourth employee be appointed
to replace retired trustee Marla Lien.
BACKGROUND
RTD has a Salaried Employee Pension Plan which has been closed to new participants after 2007, and a
Salaried Employee Defined Contribution Plan covering employees hired since then. The above Plans have
the same set of seven trustees serving both plans: two Director Trustees, RTD’s Chief Financial Officer
as a permanent trustee, and four employees. For the four employees, since 2008 the Plans have
specified that two trustees are to be “senior managers” (defined as AGM level employees) and two are
to be “middle managers.” This structure was intended to prevent Trustees from being drawn exclusively
from higher-level employees, and to give lower-level employees more opportunity for representation.
The “senior manager”-“middle manager” distinction was put in place by RTD Board resolution when RTD
converted to a Defined Contribution (DC) plan for all new employees starting in 2008.
Due to their seniority with RTD, many “senior managers” as well as “middle managers” are participants
in the Pension Plan rather than the DC plan. The current rule also prevents more junior employees, or
senior employees who do not happen to be “managers” (for example, professionals) from being able to
seek representation on the Trust.
To ensure that both plans have representation on the combined Trusts, and consistent with the 2008
goal to have more than highest-level employees on the Trusts, it is recommended that the Board revise
the selection process to specify that going forward, two employee trustees serving both trusts will be
Pension Plan participants and two will be DC Plan participants. (At some point all Pension Plan
beneficiaries may no longer be current employees due to retirement, but that point will not be reached
for several decades.)
The resolution also restores staggered trustee terms, re-appoints existing trustees to new terms, and
adds a new trustee who is a member of the Defined Contribution plan.
The attorney for the trusts, Stephen Weinstein of Berenbaum Weinshienk PC, has reviewed the proposal
and has approved the resolution as to legal form for the Trusts. Mr. Weinstein concurs that the Board is
empowered to approve this amendment; no vote by the Trustees is required or contemplated, although

Packet Pg. 570

11.E

the proposed resolution and this recommended action has been shared with the trustees for review and
comment.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action and approve the attached resolution amending the Trust plan.
This is recommended to restore staggered terms, replace the retired trustee, and assure continued
representation going forward.
2. Reject the Recommended Action and the attached resolution, and require staff to return with a
revised recommendation. This is not recommended since the attached Recommended Action has
been reviewed by the Trusts’ attorney and current trustees, and is consistent with the goals of
existing Board resolutions.

11.E.a

APPOINTMENT OF TRUSTEES TO THE RTD SALARIED EMPLOYEES’ PENSION TRUST
AND RTD SALARIED EMPLOYEES’ DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN TRUST

Whereas, RTD maintains the RTD Salaried Employees' Pension Plan and Trust ("Pension Plan"
or "Pension Trust") for salaried employees hired by RTD before January 1, 2008 and the RTD Salaried
Employees' Defined Contribution Plan and Trust ("Defined Contribution Plan" or "Defined Contribution
Trust") for salaried employees hired on or after January 1, 2008, which may collectively be referred to
as the "Trusts"; and,
Whereas, two RTD Board Directors and five salaried employees serve as the same sets of
trustees for each of the above Trusts as further described below; and,
Whereas, on January 8, 2008 the RTD Board of Directors adopted Resolution No. 1 Series of
2008 providing that a screening committee composed of the Board Chair, the Chair of the Salaried
Employee Pension Trust Fund and the Finance Chair (i.e., Chair of the Finance Administration and
Audit Committee) will screen applications from the middle management salaried employee class and the
senior management salaried employee class and will bring recommendations back to the Board; and,
Whereas, on December 16, 2008 the RTD Board of Directors adopted Resolution No. 19 Series
of 2008 amending Section 7.01 of the Pension Trust and Section 7.01 of the Defined Contribution Trust
regarding appointment of Trustees, to provide that each Trustee who is a member of the Board of
Directors of RTD shall serve a term concurrent with his or her elected term, and one senior management
and one middle management Trustee shall each serve a three year term, and one senior management and
one middle Trustee shall each serve a two year term; and
Whereas, on November 10, 2010 the RTD Board of Directors adopted Resolution No. 27 Series
of 2010, making additional modifications to state that for reappointment of Trustees who have served
satisfactorily and in whose education the Trusts have made substantial investments, it is not necessary to
seek applications for renewal, and instead the application process established by the RTD Board of
Directors in 2008 will be used on those occasions when the Board finds it necessary or appropriate to
appoint new salaried trustees to the Trusts; and
Whereas, the Defined Contribution Trust has now been in existence since 2008, and there are
now both senior and middle management RTD employees, as well as other RTD employees who are not
managers, participating in the Pension Trust or the Defined Contribution Trust and who may be well
qualified for consideration for appointment as trustees; and
Whereas, the RTD Board of Directors wishes to amend the Pension Trust and the Defined
Contribution Trust, to end the “senior” and “middle” management distinction, and instead authorize the
Board of Directors to appoint two employee Trustees who participate in the Pension Plan and two who
participate in the Defined Contribution Plan, in addition to the two Board members who are appointed to

11.E.a

Whereas, the RTD Board of Directors wishes to ensure that the four appointed employees on the
Trusts serve staggered terms as contemplated in Resolution No. 19 Series of 2008; and
Whereas, senior management Trustee Marla Lien has retired from RTD, and the terms for senior
management Trustee Scott Reed, middle management Trustee Sylvia Francis, and middle management
Trustee Luong (Lou) Ha will all expire on 12/31/2017; and
Whereas, Scott Reed, and Luong (Lou) Ha are Pension Plan participants, and Sylvia Francis is a
Defined Contribution Plan participant, requiring the RTD Board of Directors to appoint an additional
participant in the Defined Contribution Plan as a trustee, and adjust the terms of service of the remaining
employee Trustees, to accomplish the above goals; and
Whereas, consistent with the direction in the above 2008 and 2010 Resolutions, the Board
Chair, the Chair of the Salaried Employee Pension Trust and the Finance Administration and Audit
Committee Chair have considered employees to serve as trustees in accordance with this Resolution, and
recommend that the Pension Plan and Defined Contribution Plan participating employees listed below in
this Resolution be appointed as Trustees by the Board for the terms set forth below; and
Whereas, after approval of this Resolution the trustee vacancy will be filled from a Defined
Contribution Plan participating employee consistent with this Resolution and the amended Trust
Agreements.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT:
1. The RTD Board of Directors thanks retired Trustee Marla Lien for her long, dedicated and
exemplary service to the Trusts.
2. The RTD Board of Directors hereby repeals and restates Section 7.01 of each of the Trusts to
read as follows, effective immediately:
7.01. Appointment and Term of Trustees. Seven (7) persons in number shall be appointed by
the Chairperson of the Board of Directors of RTD, provided, however, such appointment shall
not become effective until there is approval thereof by resolution adopted by the Board of
Directors of RTD. Two (2) of such appointees shall be members of the Board of Directors of
RTD, one (1) shall be the RTD Chief Financial officer, and four (4) shall be salaried employees
of RTD. Of the four salaried employees, two members shall be participants in the Salaried
Employees’ Defined Benefit Plan and two shall be participants in the Salaried Employees’
Defined Contribution Plan. The four (4) salaried employees shall each serve a two (2) year term
commencing January 1 and ending December 31 (or until they are re-appointed or their
successor is appointed, if later), except that the Board of Directors of RTD may by resolution
establish different terms for newly-appointed employee Trustees as may be necessary to maintain
the staggered terms of the categories of employee Trustees. Each Trustee who is a member of the

4. A screening committee composed of the Board Chair, the Chair of the Salaried Employee
Pension Trust and the Chair of the Finance Administration and Audit Committee, in consultation
with the Chief Financial Officer, will be established to review applications for employee trustees
going forward, including applications for the second Trustee who is a defined Contribution Plan
participant as described above, and will bring recommendations back to the Board; provided,
however, that for reappointment of trustees who have served satisfactorily and in whose
education the Trusts have made substantial investments, it is not necessary to seek applications
for renewal, and the application process will be used on those occasions when the Board finds it
necessary or appropriate to appoint new salaried employee trustees to the Trusts.
5. The RTD Board of Directors hereby reaffirms that Directors Tom Tobiassen and Judy Lubow

Authorization to Enter into a Contract with
Motorola Solutions for Purchase of Radios
(56DH012)

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to enter into a $940,000 sole source contract with
Motorola Solutions(Motorola) for purchase of mobile, portable and tower radios and associated
equipment (Contract Number 56DH012). This contract will include an option for a 3-year extended
warranty.
BACKGROUND:
RTD uses a Motorola P25 digital trunked radio system for 2-way voice communications throughout the
district by many operational business units. This system was purchased as part of the Radio and
Computer Aided Dispatch/Automatic Vehicle Location (CAD/AVL) Replacement Project in 2010.
RTD is opening several rail lines in 2016, including additional light rail service for the new R Line. As
such, there will be additional Light Rail Vehicles (LRVs) and increased need for security and fare
enforcement officers. These LRVs and officers need radios to perform effectively. These radios are not
essential for the April 22nd launch of the University of Colorado A Line, but should be procured before
any other lines are opened.
Additionally, RTD’s Gunbarrel radio tower requires additional capacity. New repeaters are included in
this purchase to provide additional capacity. The radio combiner in this purchase is to replace a broken
combiner.
DISCUSSION:
As part of participation in the Public Safety radio network, all tower equipment is required to be
Motorola equipment to maintain system consistency of operations throughout the network. Additionally,
RTD currently has close to 3000 Motorola mobile and portable radios that were selected as part of a
competitive bid process. There would be additional costs for system keys, programming cables,
programming software and training associated with procurement of other radio brands. Therefore,
subscriber radios will have a higher operating cost than the recommended Motorola Radios. Additionally,
the network equipment on the public safety radio system RTD uses is manufactured by Motorola. It is
required that the network equipment remain Motorola for effective management of the network and as a
requirement of the Consolidated Communications Network of Colorado (CCNC), the managing
organization for the radio network.
RTD, as a political subdivision of the State of Colorado may buy equipment off of the existing,
competitively-procured Western States Contract Alliance (WSCA) Public Safety Communication
Equipment contract. A sole source justification memo to use the competitively-procured WSCA contract
has been approved.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The cost of the subscriber radios is funded in the 2015 capital budget. The tower radios are funded
from the Radio-CAD/AVL budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to enter into a $940,000 sole source
contract with Motorola Solutions (Motorola) for purchase of mobile, portable and tower radios
and associated equipment (Contract Number 56DH012). This contract will include an option
for a 3-year extended warranty.
2. Do not authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute a contract with Motorola
Solutions to purchase needed radio equipment. This action would result in RTD’s inability to
effectively supply security officers with needed radios, provide additional needed capacity for
tower sites, repair a tower site with faulty equipment and provide some of the radios
necessary for the opening of the R line. This is not the recommended action.

2016 Title VI Program Update

Assistant

General

Board Meeting Date: May 31, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors adopt
the 2016 Title VI Program Update to comply with federal laws, regulations and guidelines related to Title
VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
BACKGROUND
Pursuant to Section 12 of the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) Master Agreement, RTD must comply
with 49 CFR part 21 and FTA Circular 4702.1B, which effectuates Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of
1964 (Title VI), as a condition of federal financial assistance. Title VI prohibits discrimination on the
basis of race, color and national origin from recipients of federal financial assistance (grants, loans, etc.).
DISCUSSION
Per FTA Circular 4702.1B, Title VI Requirements and Guidelines for Federal Transit Administration
Recipients, RTD is required to submit a Title VI Program Update every three years. The Title VI Program
Update details the manner in which RTD intends to achieve compliance with the following objectives of
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964:
1. To ensure that FTA-assisted benefits and related services are made available and are equitably
distributed without regard to race, color, or national origin;
2. To ensure that the level and quality of FTA-assisted transit services are sufficient to provide equal
access and mobility for any person without regard to race, color or national origin;
3. To ensure that opportunities to participate in the transit planning and decision-making are
provided to persons without regard to race, color or national origin;
4. To ensure that decisions on the location of transit services and facilities are made without regard
to race, color or national origin; and
5. To ensure that corrective and remedial action is taken to prevent disparate impacts borne by any
beneficiary based on race, color, or national origin.
The update itself includes an Executive Summary and is an attachment to the board report. The
appendices of this document contain a high volume of pages (over 300), thus the appendices will be
made available separately in the Board Office for review.

Title VI Program Update
MAY 2016

Title VI and Environmental Justice
Equity is a core principle of the Regional Transportation District’s (RTD) mission to provide mass transit service
in the Denver Metro Area. An equitable mass transit system fairly distributes the benefits and adverse effects
of transit service without regard for race, color, national origin, or low-income status. This principle is detailed
and reinforced by Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of
1964 and Executive Order 12898 pertaining to
environmental justice.
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits
discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national
origin in programs receiving federal financial
assistance. Specifically, Title VI states, “No person in
the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or
national origin, be excluded from participation in, be
denied the benefits of, or be subjected to
discrimination under any program or activity receiving
Federal financial assistance.”
In 1994, President Clinton issued Executive Order
12898, which states that each federal agency “shall
make achieving environmental justice part of its mission
by identifying and addressing disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects of
its programs, policies, and activities on minority populations and low-income populations.”
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial assistance
with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI and Environmental Justice. In this circular, the FTA
requires that RTD document measures taken to comply with DOT’s Title VI regulations by submitting a Title VI
Program to their FTA regional civil rights officer once every three years or as otherwise directed by FTA.
In this Title VI program update, the Transit Oriented Communities Division has compiled a documentation of
compliance efforts made from June of 2013 – June of 2016. Below is an overview of the collection of
documents and information that comprise the 2016 Title VI Program Update.

District. Customer Satisfaction Survey data shows Denver Local and Limited Bus service is primarily utilized by
minority and low-income populations.
For detailed information pertaining to the District’s minority and low-income populations please observe the
Demographic Profile Maps and Customer Satisfaction Survey data included as appendices to this document.

Complaints
Federal recipients are also required to directly accept, log and investigate complaints of discrimination.
Further, recipients are required to notify the public of their right to complain and the procedures for
processing their complaint. In the appendix is a copy of the Title VI public notice placed on all RTD vehicles,
and a table summarizing complaints received and their status (open, closed, etc…).

RTD’s 2,340 square mile service area (primarily consisting of the Denver Metro area) is inhabited by 2.7
million people, living in diverse communities, with geographically dispersed high-concentrations of minorities
(above 29% representation in a Census tract/block group) and low-income populations (above 21%
representation in a Census tract/block group).

Subrecipient

The RTD Title VI Manager will ensure the following actions are taken affirming that RTD and its sub-recipients
comply with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and FTA Circular 4702.1B:
1. Each year sub-recipients must provide RTD with an FTA Civil Rights Assurance/Signed Assurance that
all records and other information required under FTA Circular 4702.1B have been or will be
compiled, as appropriate, and maintained;
2. Each sub-recipient must implement a Title VI complaint process and provide RTD with a list of active
lawsuits and Civil Rights Complaint summary alleging discrimination on the basis of race, color or
national origin;
3. Each sub-recipient must post its Title VI Policy Statement in prominent, conspicuous and accessible
locations throughout its facilities;
4. Sub-recipients must take responsible steps to ensure meaningful access to the benefits, services,
information, and other important portions of their programs and activities for individuals who are
Limited English Proficient (LEP).
In general, sub-recipients should have a public participation process that offers early and continuous
opportunities for the public to be involved in the identification of social, economic, and environmental impacts
of proposed transportation decisions. Efforts to involve minority and low-income people in public involvement
activities can include both comprehensive measures, such as placing public notices at all stations and in all
vehicles, and measures targeted to overcome linguistic, institutional, cultural, economic, historical, or other
barriers that may prevent minority and low-income populations from effectively participating in a recipient’s
decision-making. Sub-recipients must file with RTD documentation of its public participation plan.
Each sub-recipient further agrees to comply
with, and assure compliance by its third party
subcontractors at any tier under the Project, with
all requirements of the FTA Title VI Program
pursuant to FTA Circular 4702.1B and 49 CFR
21.5(b)(2) and 49 CFR 21 .5(b)(7), Appendix C

11.G.b
Title VI Program Update

FTA Circular 4702.1b Chapter VI requires fixed-route service providers of Urbanized Areas with a
population of 200,000 or more to establish service standards and monitor their service to ensure service is
provided accordingly. Service standards guide fixed-route service providers toward objective decisionmaking in the provision of service. The FTA further expects transit agencies to monitor their services to ensure
service is provided in a non-discriminatory manner. Service is monitored by comparing a sampling of nonminority routes and minority routes, defined as 1/3 of revenue mileage borders census blocks with a minority
population greater than the service area average. No disparities were found during the transit monitoring of
this reporting period. The RTD service standards and transit monitoring results can be found in the appendix.

Fare and Service Change Equity Analyse s
The FTA requires RTD to establish policies that will guide the analysis to determine whether major service
changes will have a disproportionately negative impact on minority or low-income populations. Accordingly,
RTD established equity analysis policies and a service evaluation process to meet this requirement.

Equity Analysis Policies
Per FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Major Service Change Policy, a Disparate
Impact Policy, and a Disproportionate Burden Policy. Collectively, these policies provide foundational
requirements for evaluating service change proposals for equity. These policies and their applicable
thresholds are listed below:
1. Major Service Change Policy: A major service change is defined as a 25 percent addition or
reduction in the service hours of any route that would remain in effect for twelve (12) or more months.
All major service changes will be subject to an equity analysis that includes an analysis of adverse
effects.
a. Adverse Effect is defined as a geographical or temporal reduction in service that includes, but
is not limited to: eliminating a route, shortening a route by eliminating segments, rerouting an
existing route, and increasing headways. RTD shall consider the degree of adverse effects
and analyze those effects when planning major service changes.
2. Disparate Impact Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a minority population
10 percent more than non-minority populations; this level of impact is considered a disparate impact.
3. Disproportionate Burden Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a low-income
population 10 percent more than non-low-income
populations; this level of impact is considered a
disproportionate burden. A low-income population
is a group of households who are at or below 150
percent of the Department of Health and Human
Services Poverty Guidelines.
If a proposed major service change results in a
disparate impact or a disproportionate burden,
RTD will consider modifying the proposed service
change. RTD will then analyze the modification and
make sure it removed the potential disparate
impact or disproportionate burden. If a less
discriminatory option cannot be identified and RTD
can demonstrate a substantial legitimate
justification for the proposed service change, the

FTA may allow RTD to proceed with the proposed change.
The board approved policies can be found in the appendix.

This program update includes the results of both fare and service change equity analyses completed between
February 2013 and April 2016. Included with the results of each equity analysis are the proposed changes
and Board of Directors Meeting Minutes associated with the proposed change. Below is a list of each

CONCLUSION
During this reporting period, RTD performed extensive public engagement, completed several equity analyses
for major fare and service changes and found no probable cause in any official Title VI complaints. The
comprehensive analysis and monitoring efforts described in this document succeeded in promoting the
equitable provision of transit service in the Denver Metro Area. This snapshot summarizes RTD’s effort to not
only comply with the requirements of FTA Circular 4702.1B, but to advance social equity through policy and
public engagement.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

Date: May 4, 2016

From:

Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

May 4, 2016

Board Meeting Date:

Subject:

State Legislative Liaison Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Government Relations Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the
General Manager, or his designee, to enter into an agreement for state legislative liaison services with
Brandeberry~McKenna Public Affairs (BBMK) to exercise a one-year option (June 30, 2016 through
June 29, 2017) to extend Contract No. 13-DX-00, at a cost of $122,000, pursuant to the Contract
Award agreement.
BACKGROUND
Contract 13-DX-001 for State Legislative Liaison Services was signed with Brandeberry~McKenna
Public Affairs, effective July 1, 2013, and contained a provision for four (4) additional one-year option
periods. This board action would exercise the option for Year 3 of the option years. Of extreme
importance, the lobbyists are in daily contact with state legislators regarding bills that RTD seeks to have
passed, as well as regarding bills that would be harmful to RTD.
DISCUSSION
The state lobbying team provides guidance and direction for the RTD Board of Directors and staff in
their relationships with the General Assembly members. Constant monitoring of the activities within
the General Assembly and the Executive Office of the state of Colorado is required, and RTD’s
interests must be conveyed to appropriate legislators, including testifying before certain committees.
Advice and assistance in drafting legislation are also provided by the lobbying team. When RTD has
had legislation before the General Assembly, Brandeberry~McKenna has an excellent record of
making certain that these bills pass and become part of the Colorado statutes.
As part of the services, frequent contact is made with RTD staff and board members regarding various
bills in the legislature; written summary reports are issued on a weekly basis during the legislative
session; and status reports are given at the Government Relations Committee meetings while the
General Assembly is in session and as deemed necessary thereafter.
The Brandeberry~McKenna team also takes the initiative to educate state legislators on RTD issues and
projects so that these legislators understand mass transit and RTD’s mission.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Approve the Recommended Action. It is recommended by RTD’s Government Relations Committee
that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to enter into an agreement for state
legislative liaison services with Brandeberry~McKenna Public Affairs (BBMK) to exercise a one-year
option (June 30, 2016 through June 29, 2017) to extend Contract No. 13-DX-001, at a cost of
$122,000, pursuant to the Contract Award agreement.
2. Do not approve the Recommended Action.
Do not accept the recommendation by the
Government Relations Committee that authorizes the General Manager to enter into a contract to
execute the state legislative liaison services one-year option agreement. A new Request for

Proposals could be sent to interested parties, interviews conducted, and a different state lobbying
firm could possibly be selected by the Government Relations Committee and retained. This action
is not recommended because it is the consensus of the Government Relations Committee to
recommend to the Board the selection of the Brandeberry~McKenna team.
3. Do not approve the Recommended Action. Do not retain the services of a state legislative liaison
firm. This action is not recommended because it would put RTD in the position of facing
contentious and potentially harmful legislative issues with no direct legislative liaison services. It
was determined by the Government Relations Committee that the Brandeberry~McKenna team
has been very effective in pursuing the RTD state legislative agenda and will continue to
represent RTD’s interests very well in the future. This team is very familiar with RTD’s issues
and policies.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Finance Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Resolution”), authorizing the issuance of Regional
Transportation District Sales Tax Revenue Bonds (FasTracks Projects), Series 2016A.
BACKGROUND:
The FasTracks financial plan anticipates the financing of certain components of the FasTracks
projects including the District’s Southeast Rail Extension Project and financing additional costs of the
FasTracks Projects including EAGLE, I-225, North Metro and related costs of issuance. The Bonds
will finance these FasTracks improvements, fund associated reserve accounts if deemed necessary
and costs of issuance.
The resolution also allows for the potential refinancing of the Series 2010A and Series 2012A
FasTracks bonds if economically beneficial to RTD and generates more than a 3% present value
savings at the time of the issuance of the Series 2016A bonds.
The Chief Financial Officer has taken preliminary actions to arrange for the issuance and sale of the
bonds, including assembling financial information related to the District and drafting a preliminary
official statement, bond indenture, continuing disclosure agreement, bond purchase agreement and
the Resolution for issuance of the Bonds. The Board is being requested, through the Resolution, to
authorize the issuance, to establish the terms and to approve agreements required in connection with
the issuance of the Bonds.
DISCUSSION:
To date, the District has issued the following parity bonds to fund the FasTracks Projects:

Through the Resolution, the Board is being asked to authorize the issuance of the Bonds and to
approve parameters subject to the restrictions and parameters outlined in the Section 4 of the
Resolution; namely that the principal amount of the Bonds shall not exceed $200,000,000; the final
maturity on the Bonds shall not extend beyond December 1, 2046; the maximum net effective
interest rate on the Bonds shall not exceed 7.00% and the combined purchase price of the Bonds
shall not be less than 98%.
Drafts of documents referenced in the Bond Resolution including the Bond Indenture, the Continuing
Disclosure Agreement, the Preliminary Official Statement and the Bond Purchase Agreement are
available for review in the Board Office.
RTD is receiving the advice of First Southwest Company, as independent financial advisor, Butler
Snow LLP as Bond Counsel, and Hogan Lovells as Disclosure Counsel in regard to the Bonds. The
Bonds will be underwritten by a team including Goldman Sachs, Royal Bank of Canada Capital
Markets, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Piper Jaffray and Harvestons Securities.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
Principal and interest costs related to the Bonds are included in the budget and the FasTracks
financial plan adopted by the board in August 2015. Costs associated with the issuance of the
securities are considered “costs of issuance” and will be funded out of Bond proceeds. These costs
include underwriter, financial advisory, attorney and, printing fees.
ALTERNATIVES:
1.
Authorize the execution of documents, including the attached Resolution No. __, Series of
2016, authorizing the issuance of the District’s Tax-Exempt Sales Tax Revenue Bonds
(FasTracks Project), Series 2016A. This is the recommended action.
2.

Do not authorize the execution of documents, including the attached Resolution No. __,
Series of 2016, authorizing the issuance of the District’s Tax-Exempt Sales Tax Revenue
Bonds (FasTracks Project), Series 2016A. This is not the recommended action as it would
adversely affect RTD’s ability to complete FasTracks committed projects.

Board Meeting Date: May 31, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Resolution”), expressing the intent of the Board to
be reimbursed from a future financing for certain expenses relating to the acquisition of buses.
BACKGROUND:
The SBP adopted by the board in 2015 anticipates the acquisition and financing of buses, including
MCI buses, 40 foot transit buses, 60 foot articulated buses, 30 foot transit buses and smaller cut
away vehicles used for Call n Ride and ADA services.
DISCUSSION:
Some of the vehicles identified in the SBP will begin arriving in May 2016 and RTD will begin paying
for the vehicles shortly after delivery and acceptance. In order for these bus acquisition expenses to
be eligible for reimbursement from a future financing, a reimbursement resolution such as the one
being recommended must be adopted by the Board.
In the coming months, the Chief Financial Officer will take preliminary actions to arrange for the
financing, including assembling financial information related to the District and drafting preliminary
documents and a Resolution for the financing. Drafts of these documents and the Resolution for the
financing will be brought to the Board for consideration at a future time.
The Board is being requested, through this Resolution, to express the intent of the Board to be
reimbursed for certain expenses relating to the acquisition of busses through a future financing.
RTD is receiving the advice of Butler Snow LLP as Bond Counsel in regard to this reimbursement
resolution.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
Principal and interest costs related to this future financing are included in the budget and the SBP
adopted by the Board in 2015.
ALTERNATIVES:
1.
Authorize the attached Resolution No. __, Series of 2016, expressing the intent of the
Board to be reimbursed for certain expenses relating to the financing of buses. This is the
recommended action.
2.

Do not authorize the execution of documents, including the attached Resolution No. __, Series
of 2016, expressing the intent of the Board to be reimbursed for certain expenses relating to

the financing of buses. This is not the recommended action as it would adversely affect
RTD’s ability to proceed with bus acquisition projects.

financing of such Project; and
WHEREAS, it is the Board’s reasonable expectation that when such financing
occurs, the capital expenditures will be reimbursed with the proceeds of the financing; and
WHEREAS, in order to comply with the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended, it is the Board’s desire that this resolution shall constitute the “official
intent” of the Board to reimburse such capital expenditures within the meaning of Treasury

the costs of the Project, including the reimbursement of certain costs incurred by the District
prior to the receipt of any proceeds of a financing, upon terms acceptable to the District, as
authorized in a resolution to be hereafter adopted and to take all further action which is necessary
or desirable in connection therewith.
Section 3.
The officers, employees and agents of the District shall take all
action necessary or reasonably required to carry out, give effect to and consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and shall take all action necessary or desirable to acquire and

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

Date: May 19, 2016

From:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

May 18, 2016

Board Meeting Date: May 31, 2016

Subject:

August 2016 Service Change Final

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the August 2016 Service Change package as revised and summarized in Attachment A resulting
in an annualized cost of approximately $537,935 and, further, to authorize the General Manager or his
designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is impacted
by these changes.
DISCUSSION
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. We will continue adjusting services in
response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. It is also
our responsibility to identify services that are underperforming and recommend modifications,
curtailment or cancellation of service as warranted. The proposals herein include a mix of service
enhancements, routine schedule adjustments and several service reductions. Also included in this report
is a grant funded proposal anticipated to be implemented in the August service change. Funded through
a CMAQ grant, enhancements to the frequency of the Free Metro Ride operating between DUS and Civic
Center Station are proposed. We will monitor customer response to the implementation of these service
changes and propose adjustments and service alternatives as appropriate in future service change
recommendations.
The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
 Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
 Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
SUMMARY OF PUBLIC HEARINGS
Two hearings were held in Denver at the Blake Administration building and one meeting was held in
Longmont and one meeting in Commerce City. Comments and further details from these meetings and
the service change website are summarized in Attachment B of this report.
CHANGES TO INITIAL RECOMMENDATIONS
Staff receives input during the public comment process and continues to conduct additional analysis
after the initial service recommendations are communicated to the Board of Directors. Depending on the
outcome of the public comment process and continued analysis, staff may or may not propose
modifications to these initial recommendations. The following represent substantive changes proposed to

Packet Pg. 650

12.K

the service changes initially communicated to the Board of Directors for implementation as part of the
August 2016 service change:
Route 62: this proposal has been postponed until the completion of roadway work around the
Commerce City municipal center
Free Metro Ride: additional trips expanding the higher peak frequency period are proposed to further
enhance availability of service from Denver Union Station. The subsequent increase in cost is included in
the current proposal, which is fundable through its CMAQ grant.
SUMMARY OF PROPOSED SERVICE CHANGES

Routes proposed for service improvements:
Route 62 – Commerce City/Stapleton: proposal postponed.
Route 83L – Parker/Leetsdale: add a 5:04am weekday and 5:39am weekend trips from Civic Center
Station to Nine Mile.
Route 121 – Peoria Street: shift 12:15am from 40th & Airport Station to 12:45am.
Flatiron Flyer – US 36 BRT: add one PM eastbound Route FF6 trip
Free MetroRide: increase peak period frequency to operate every 4.5 minutes.

Routes proposed for service reductions:
BroncosRide and CU/CSU Game: discontinue BroncosRide and CU/CSU special service from the
Montbello park-nRide.

Routes proposed for mixed service improvements/service reductions:
Route 3 – Alameda Avenue: cutback 2:57pm eastbound trip from Federal Center Station, to instead
originate at Lakewood Commons at 3:15pm.
Route 31 – Federal Crosstown: extend and convert a Route 30 trip to 72nd Avenue as a Route 31 trip
and shift the afternoon northbound school tripper.
Route 72/72W – 72nd Avenue Crosstown: convert 72W trips into 72 trips.
Route BOLT – Boulder/Longmont: convert selected peak trips to become express trips.

Routes proposed for routine running time analysis/schedule adjustments
Route 1 – 1st Avenue: running time analysis to improve on-time performance
Route 3 – Alameda Avenue: adjust evening trip times
Route 11 – Mississippi Avenue: adjust evening trip times
Route 16 – West Colfax: minor schedule adjustments
Route 28 – 28th Avenue: minor schedule adjustments
Route 51 – Sheridan Boulevard: minor schedule adjustments
Route 66 – Arapahoe Road: running time and trip time adjustments
Route 76 – Wadsworth Boulevard: minor schedule adjustments
Flatiron Flyer – US 36 BRT: routine schedule adjustments

Seasonal Service Changes
School Service
Resume seasonal school service on the following routes:
Routes 1, 9, 11, 24, 30, 30Ltd, 31, 51, 52, 65, 73, 100, 206/206F and 208/208F
(Route 43 school tripper service replaced by increased frequency on the Route 43)
Routes BOUND, DASH, JUMP, SKIP and STAMPEDE: Change to fall/winter schedules.
Route N – Nederland/Boulder: reinstate routing to Eldora Ski Resort.

Packet Pg. 651

12.K

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The overall financial impact contained in this proposal is estimated to be $537,935 annualized, with
$490,175 being funded through CMAQ grants, resulting in a net base system impact of $47,760.
EQUITY ANALYSIS
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and
Executive Order 12898 regarding Environmental Justice. In this circular, the FTA requires RTD to
evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that exceed the established major service
change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a disproportionately negative impact on
minority or low-income populations. Our evaluation of the proposed August 2016 service changes does
not reveal any disparities in impacts absorbed by minority or low-income populations.
A Look Ahead – January 2017
The following items are service concepts currently under consideration or are planned events that impact
operations in the next service change period:
Route 43 – Martin Luther King Boulevard
Due to the likely increase in ridership caused by extending the service to the Auraria Campus the peak
periods will have to be monitored for need of additional capacity.
E Line
Responding to recent growth on the E Line weekday midday period (9:30 AM-2:30 PM) warrants an
increase in service to provide 15-minute service.

Public Meeting Comments

Thursday, May 19th, 2016
Longmont Senior Center
5:30 PM
Facilitator: Nataly Erving
The meeting was started at 5:35pm with RTD Staff in attendance: Director Judy Lubow,
David Menter. City of Longmont Staff in attendance: Phil Greenwald; City of Longmont
TAB representatives: Buzz Feldman, Bob Lee
4 members of the public attended.
Lynn Philippsen requested that the stop at Table Mesa and Tantra Drive be considered as a
stop on the US36 BRT Flatiron Flyer routes. She stated that the walk to the closest BRT
stop was too far. Staff pointed out that local underlying service on routes DASH and 206
is available and that at this time demand at this stop location does not warrant for it to be
a BRT stop. Staff will continue to monitor demand in this regard.
Bob Lee liked the proposed changes for the BOLT, J and L stops, as well as the Bolt
Express trips. He stated that he would like to see the fare for route BOLT to be local all the
way between Longmont and Boulder and urged RTD staff to reconsider the recent fare
zone change. He also requested that RTD staff look into airport service from Longmont to
Denver, as well as a meeting to discuss various options in this regard with city staff and
members of the TAB. RTD staff will coordinate with City of Longmont staff to set up such
a meeting.
Buzz Feldman also stated that he agreed with the proposed changes and asked when they
would go into effect. He suggested that instead of calling the faster trips on route BOLT
‘express’ to reference them as ‘Limited’ in order to not be too confusing or perhaps
misleading, since the trips will serve all of the agreed upon stops for regular route BOLT
within Longmont and then only travel at a faster pace once outside of the city. Staff
agreed that this would be a good idea and that they would consider doing so.
Peter Lloyd was concerned about the connections from route BOLT to route 206 and
having to walk from 28th Street to Boulder Junction in order to now make his connection.
Upon review of the proposed BOLT Express trips he however noted that they would most
likely provide a good alternative and better connection for him to get from Longmont to
the East Flatiron Business Park. He also encouraged staff to make sure that the
connections to these express trips from route 324 at 8th & Coffman Park-n-Ride be
considered. In addition, he requested to have route FLEX consider making better
connections at Boulder Junction to route 206.
Rolf Kaumann stated that he is a route L (LNX/LSX) passenger and appreciates the service,
as well as that RTD staff is willing to listen to customer concerns and input. He asked why
routes LNX and LSX have to ‘loop’ via 21st and Terry Street before continuing their trips

and requested for staff to look into the elimination of this routing since it could save up to
5 minutes of travel time.
Andrea Papa requested that there be a later LNX or LSX trip in the AM peak that would
better match the 9am work shift start time in Downtown Denver.
Phil Greenwald pointed out that the city is in the process of developing a community
development plan and that within that plan there are suggestions for future bus routes,
including a potential routing for a true BOLT Express, which would avoid multiple railroad
crossings within Longmont.
The meeting closed at 6:30pm.

12:00 noon
This meeting was started at 12:00 Pm with 7 public participants. RTD Staff in attendance:
Jessie Carter, Diane Marquiss, Doug Monroe, Cooper Langdon, Jeff Dunning. The
following comments were made during the meeting:
Margarita T. Barcelo’ (Marsala) – She was concerned about the service to Auraria Campus
as she heard that the current service, Routes 6 and 43, were temporary and soon to be
discontinued. Jessie informed her that the service was there to stay as we had just made
the changes to have the routes serve the Auraria Campus.
Mary Beth Patterson – Was asking about the CV changes to the 5:07pm express trip up to
Pine Junction. She does not want that trip changed to a CS that services the Federal
Center. Doug Monroe explained that the wording on the public notice was a little
confusing and informed her that the CX will not be changed to the CS. He also told her
that some of the other CV trips may be shifted slightly to provide better overall service.
Glenn Ressmeyer – Glenn started out by saying how much he likes the new A-line service.
However, he said he does not like the changes we have made with the bus service on the
east side of town associated with the A-line opening. He specifically mentioned the Rte
153 and 121. He said the changes have negatively impacted his commute to the Denver
Tech Center and he would like to see the service changed.
Jackson Deak – He represents a disabled group of passengers and would like to have the
Route 15L stop at Colfax and High St. He would also like to see more frequent service on
the Route 3. Jeff Dunning explained that the Route 3 may end up with more frequent
service and that it was unlikely the 15L would stop at High Street because adding stops to
the 15L would defeat the purpose of the route being a Limited stop service.
Geoffrey Bateman – He was with Jackson Deak and wanted to know what factors are
considered when planning a route and deciding which stops will be served. He was asking
because of their desire to have Colfax/High added to the stops on the 15L. Jeff Dunning
explained the factors we consider against what type of route we are operating, in this
instance a “Limited”.
Gina Richards – She commented on, what she perceived, was reduced service to the
Montbello neighborhood since the A-Line opened. Jessie Carter explained the service
changes to her and how they provide an overall service improvement to the area. She also

wanted to know if RTD had a community outreach group that she could contact regarding
current and future service changes.
Jessie told her she could reach out to the
Service/Planning department directly or we could get her the correct contact for the
community outreach group. She said she would check our website herself and didn’t
want to provide us with her contact information.
Kevin – Kevin is an ADA passenger and wanted to know about the new Commuter Rail
service and how it would impact his commute from Lafayette. Doug Monroe went over
some of our service that would benefit him the most. He left his contact information so
we could reach out to him with information.

6:00 PM
This meeting was started at 6:00 PM with 2 public participants and one RTD Staff
member. The meeting began at 6:15 PM and was concluded at 6:40 PM. The following
comments were made during the meeting:
Helen Lee – Does not understand the thoughts behind changes to the Broomfield CnR, as
related to the introduction of the Superior Call-n-Ride. Her commute pattern does not have
a fixed-route alternative, where the area covered by the new Superior Call-n-Ride has
alternative service, she opined. She would like to have the former service area restored.
Kenneth C. - Formerly used the Route 40 trips to UPS and currently uses the Route 37. He
requested that RTD recreate the later morning and afternoon trips that were available on
the Route 40 for “late shift” workers at UPS.
