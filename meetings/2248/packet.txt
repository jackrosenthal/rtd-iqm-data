Civil Rights Division
Division Overview
The Regional Transportation District (RTD) Civil Rights Division is comprised of four units: (1)
Workforce Initiative Now (WIN) (2) the Small Business Office (SBO), (3) the Equal Opportunity Office
(EO), and (4) Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The Civil Rights Division aims to provide our
passengers, employees, business partners, contractors, and communities with equal opportunity
and protection from unlawful discrimination in the areas of employment, third party external
contracting, and access to public transit services. Nearly five years into the program, we have
implemented several successful communication platforms as part of our community and business
outreach initiatives.
RTD General Manager, Phillip A. Washington, implemented his vision, to create a Civil Rights
Division, a collaborative, all-encompassing Division responsible for all matters concerning nondiscrimination, inclusion, opportunities, justice and equity. The RTD Civil Rights Division continues to
advocate for economic growth, identify and eliminate barriers to success and create opportunities
for those historically excluded from access. The Civil Rights Division is dedicated and committed to
this purpose which resonates throughout the District. What follows is a summary of the Civil Rights
Division's annual report for FY 2014 and current projections for FY 2015.

Small Business Office
Foundation
RTD Small Business Office aims to empower small and disadvantaged businesses, help them advance in
the transit industry, and evaluate their progress as they succeed. Through workforce creation, training
and contract opportunities, the RTD/FasTracks DBE/SBE program is a catalyst for achieving a stronger
metropolitan Denver, Colorado economy.
RTD Small Business Office established and administers the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE)
Program and the Small Business Enterprise (SBE) Program to foster equal opportunities for
disadvantaged and small businesses by leveling the playing field for certified DBEs and SBEs. The goal of
each program is to reduce obstacles and to increase the growth, development and participation of
disadvantaged and small businesses in contracting opportunities on RTD projects and contracts. RTD
sets goals for DBE/SBE participation on the FasTracks projects as well as RTD Base systems projects. RTD
ensures ongoing compliance, management and monitoring of the programs by tracking performance
and measuring results.

1.C.1.a

1.C.1.a

Small Business Office
RTD is required to administer a DBE program as a condition for receiving federal funds. The DBE
Program is for business owners who can prove that they are socially and economically disadvantaged
and comply with all other requirements of 49 CFR Part 26. The DBE program is primarily designed to
ensure non-discrimination in USDOT funded contracts and to promote the utilization of socially and
economically disadvantaged businesses. As mandated by FTA, RTD is required to submit a DBE goal
methodology to FTA on a triennial basis by looking at federal expenditures projected for three
upcoming years as well as looking at the census data, bidders list, the pool of available DBEs in the
state of Colorado, etc. Currently, RTD has a 19% agency DBE goal which is tracked, monitored and
reported to FTA on a semi-annual basis. RTD is currently exceeding its DBE goal.
The RTD SBE Program was created by RTD and adopted by its Board of Directors to ensure local
participation of small businesses on locally funded projects. It is a race and gender neutral program
primarily based on business size standard and the personal network of the qualifying applicant(s).
The SBE program is primarily designed to promote the use of economically disadvantaged businesses
in a race-neutral framework. This is accomplished by increasing the capacities of such firms to
successfully compete with other firms of the same size for prime and subcontracting opportunities.

Purpose

1.C.1.a

The Small Business Office has achieved much in 2014 and is on track to
continue that positive momentum into 2015. The SBO focuses efforts on
maintaining relationships with RTD internal stakeholders, our
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) stakeholders and the DBE and SBE
community at large, the SBO continues to have an unparalleled
comprehensive compliance monitoring program on RTD FasTracks and Base
Systems projects which leads to increased participation and additional
opportunities across the board for DBE and SBE firms.
The SBO’s foundation measures expectations through ensuring the “Five

subcontracting goals through the goal analyses and
determination process

documentation
• Preventing unjust removal of DBE and SBEs

the Small Business Office,
small and disadvantaged
businesses have been
awarded over $1 billion
on RTD projects.

2) Outreach/ Networking and Public Participation Process
• Small/Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Advisory Council
(S/DBEAC) which reports project updates, opportunities,
spotlights stellar performance, and facilitates panel
discussions
• In The Spotlight acknowledges exceptional performance of
DBE-SBE firms, prime contractors, and project managers
3) Trainings, Surveying, Mentoring and Technical Assistance
• D/SBE Orientation Workshop
• Bonding
4) Implementation of MOUs

Program Overview

To ensure compliance with the law, the EO office continues to
utilize internal and external program initiatives, policy
development, and procedures. EO continues to lead three
committee meetings that include CHEL (Civil Rights/Human
Resources/Employee Liaison/Legal Divisions), ADA (Americans
with Disabilities Act), and ADAAC (ADA Advisory
Committee). The committees serve to represent the District’s
needs and concerns.
Internal efforts include monitoring the salary offer &
compensation process, claim/complaint processes, soft
investigations, and educational trainings and workshops.

Did you know…
The Age Discrimination in
Employment Act (ADEA) only
forbids age discrimination
against people who are age
40 or older. It does not
protect workers under the
age of 40, although some
states do have laws that
protect younger workers
from age discrimination.
Colorado is not one of them.

The Equal Opportunity Office also has a responsibility to external
constituencies. The EO office serves as RTD’s liaison with federal
and state governments regarding all matters concerning equal
opportunity. The EO office also handles all external
claim/complaints, mediations, and investigations.

Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
Foundation
The Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, 29 U.S.C. § 794, was the precursor to the ADA
and protects qualified individuals from discrimination based upon a disability. Section 504
of the Rehabilitation Act applies to entities that receive federal assistance including RTD.
The Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. § 12601 et seq., was passed in 1990,
and amended in 2008 pursuant to the ADA Amendments Act (PL110-325). The sections of
the ADA applicable to RTD are the first two titles. Title I applies to employment practices
and Title II applies to public services. Part B of Title II, 42 U.S.C. § 12141 et seq. specifically
covers public transportation provided by public entities. This law prohibits discrimination
on the basis of disability, requires the provision of paratransit service, and sets standards
for transportation facilities and vehicles.
The Department of Justice regulates and enforces Section 504 and the ADA, except that the
Department of Transportation (“DOT”) and the Federal Transit Administration (“FTA”)
administer the mass transportation provisions of Section 504 and the ADA, and DOT has
issued implementing regulations at 49 C.F.R. Parts 27, 37 and 38.
Purpose
RTD is committed to addressing the needs and challenges of all individuals by facilitating
accessibility, mobility and community involvement through our programs and services. RTD
is dedicated to providing a wide array of resources that help individuals to participate in
activities, access services, and contribute fully as members of the community.

Date: February 3, 2015

From:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

February 3, 2015

Board Meeting Date: February 17, 2015

Subject:

Approve Contract Amendment to Supply 64 40' Transit Buses

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to exercise an option and amend contract 13-FH-053
with Gillig LLC. in an amount not to exceed $27,500,000 for the purchase of 64 additional 40’ transit
buses and associated spare components.
BACKGROUND
In support of the Board adopted strategic goal of Innovative and Fiscally Sustainable Service Delivery,
including Asset Management/State of Good Repair, Bus Operations has begun the process of replacing
the aging and high maintenance Orion sub-fleet of 40 foot transit buses.
RTD’s existing 2000 Series Orion transit buses have exceeded their FTA service life of 12 years. The
buses are now 15 years old and have accumulated on average 685,000 miles of stop-and-go transit
service. They have become unreliable and require intensive maintenance to keep them in service. The
bus manufacturer, Orion Bus Industries, went out of business several years ago. Many of the parts
required for the repair of the buses are now difficult to obtain. The adopted Strategic Budget Plan (SBP)
calls for the replacement of the Orion sub-fleet of buses over three years, 125 buses in 2013, 110
buses in 2014 and 64 buses in 2015.
On November 26, 2013 the RTD Board of Directors approved the procurement of 125 Gillig 40’ transit
buses to begin the replacement to the existing 40 foot Orion buses. The original procurement was the
result of RTD Request for Proposals (RFP) 13-FH-053 issued in May of 2013. Proposals were received in
September, 2013. The contract allows RTD the options to purchase up to 307 additional buses over a
five year period. Pricing for additional option buses is based on the initial base pricing plus an inflationary
price adjustment computed using the US Department of Labor’s “Producer Price Index” or PPI which is
published monthly.
On June 24, 2014 the RTD Board of Directors approved the contract amendment for additional 110
Gillig 40’ transit buses.
This request is for the Board’s approval of the contract amendment to Gillig to exercise the purchase
option for a guaranteed quantity of 64 additional 40’ transit buses to complete the replacement of the
2000 Series Orion buses.
DISCUSSION

Packet Pg. 48

2.B.1

The 40’ transit buses are low floor for ease of passenger boarding and de-boarding. They will be
equipped with a wheelchair ramp and two wheelchair access areas to allow for ADA compliance.
Their clean diesel engines will meet the latest EPA regulations and will reduce exhaust emissions up
to 90% from the level of the existing buses. The buses will be equipped with an automatic passenger
count system and a security digital camera system. They will have two passenger doors, 35
passenger seats, and two spaces for storage of large items such as walker, child stroller and
shopping caddy.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The requested approval is for the contract amendment to Gillig to exercise the purchase option for a
guaranteed quantity of 64-40’ transit buses and associated spare components in the amount not to
exceed $27,500,000. The funding for this contract is approved and available in the District’s 2015
Adopted Budget.
DBE PARTICIPATION
There is no DBE requirement for transit vehicle purchases. Each vehicle manufacturer is required by the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to submit a DBE plan for FTA approval. As part of the required
proposal submittal documents, Gillig has submitted a certificate attesting to FTA’s approval of its DBE
plan.
ALTERNATIVES
1. To authorize the General Manager to issue a contract amendment to Gillig for the purchase of 64-40’
transit buses. This is the recommended alternative.
2. Do not authorize the contract amendment and re-solicit proposals. This is not desirable as it would
result, at the very least, in a delay of the delivery of the buses and may increase the cost of the project.

Approve Contract Amendment to Supply 18 60’ Articulated Buses

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to exercise an option and amend contract 13-FK-001 in
an amount not to exceed $12,300,000 with New Flyer of America Inc. for the purchase of 18 additional
60’ articulated buses and associated spare components.
BACKGROUND
In support of the Board adopted strategic goal of Innovative and Fiscally Sustainable Service Delivery,
including Asset Management/State of Good Repair, Bus Operations has begun the process of replacing
the aging and high maintenance NABI sub-fleet of 60’ articulated buses.
RTD’s existing 9100 Series NABI articulated buses have exceeded their FTA service life of 12 years. The
buses are now15 years old and have accumulated on average 430,000 miles of stop-and-go transit
service. Their structures have experienced heavy damage due to rust, corrosion and fatigue. They have
become unreliable and require intensive maintenance to keep them in service. Many of the parts
required for the repair of the buses are now difficult to obtain. The adopted Strategic Budget Plan (SBP)
calls for the replacement of the 9100 Series buses over three years, 40 buses in 2013, 40 buses in
2014 and 18 buses in 2015.
On August 20, 2013 the RTD Board of Directors approved the procurement of 52 New Flyer 60’
articulated buses. This procurement was for the replacement of 40 existing NABI 60’ articulated buses
and also supplied 12 - 60’ articulated buses for the Free MetroRide service. The original procurement
was the result of RTD Request for Proposals (RFP 13-FK-001). Proposals were received on May 17,
2013. The contract allows RTD the options to purchase up to 162 additional buses over a five year
period. Pricing for additional option buses is based on the initial base pricing plus an inflationary price
adjustment computed using the US Department of Labor’s “Producer Price Index” or PPI which is
published monthly.
On June 24, 2014 the RTD Board of Directors approved the contract amendment for additional 40 New
Flyer articulated buses.

2. Do not authorize the contract amendment and re-solicit proposals. This is not desirable as it would

further, to authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute contract amendments as necessary
for private operators whose service is impacted by these changes
DISCUSSION
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. We will continue adjusting services in
response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. It is also
our responsibility to identify services that are underperforming and recommend modifications,
curtailment or cancellation of service as warranted. The proposals herein include a mix of service
enhancements, routine schedule adjustments and several service reductions. The proposal regarding the
cancellation of the Route DD and reduction in frequency on the Light Rail W- Line are
ridership/performance based and in accord with RTD Service Standards. We will monitor customer
response to the implementation of these service changes and propose adjustments and service
alternatives as appropriate in future service change recommendations.
The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
 Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
 Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
SUMMARY OF PUBLIC HEARINGS
Five public hearings were held during the public comment period, which extended between January 27th
and Februaryr 4th. Public meetings were held in Denver, Lakewood and Louisville with nearly 60 public
participants. Comments from these meetings and the service change website are summarized in
Attachment B of this report.
CHANGES TO INITIAL RECOMMENDATIONS
Staff receives input during the public comment process and continues to conduct additional analysis
after the initial service recommendations are communicated to the Board of Directors. Depending on the
outcome of the public comment process and continued analysis, staff may or may not propose
modifications to these initial recommendations. The following represent substantive changes proposed to
the service changes initially communicated to the Board of Directors for implementation as part of the
May 2015 service change.

Light Rail
C-Line
It is proposed to adjust the clock headway pattern of the C-Line in the AM and PM peak periods
on Mondays through Fridays and have trips leaving 6 minutes later northbound and 9 minutes
earlier southbound. This will create a smoother headway of trains on the Southwest Line, where
there will be a train (C or D) every 6 or 9 minutes, more evenly spaced than today. This also
opens up the opportunity to increase headways on the E-Line, which currently shares open slots
with the C-Line. No operating hours savings or additions are anticipated with this change.
D-Line
It is proposed to start the 4:13 AM northbound trip from Mineral Station at Evans Station at 4:28
on Sundays and Holidays. This affects 6 passengers. Savings are estimated to be $5,370
annualized.
E-Line
It is proposed to add one peak round-trip train in the AM and PM peak (6:54 AM from Lincoln
Station, 7:44 AM from Union Station, 4:09 PM from Lincoln Station, and 4:58 PM from Union
Station) and to assist with increasing ridership demand to/from Union Station and W-Line
transfers. This takes advantage of the altered C-Line schedule, creates a 15-minute frequency for
half an hour in each peak period, and is a test to determine the feasibility of adding more 15minute headway E-Line service in the future.
Cost impacts are estimated to be $235,875 annualized.
It is also proposed to discontinue the 4:33 AM northbound trip from Lincoln Station Mondays
through Fridays. An F-Line trips runs ahead of this train and a C-Line pullout to Union Station will
be adjusted to maintain the connection to Union Station and the W-Line. 20 passengers will be
affected by this change. Savings are estimated to be $70,750 annualized.
Additionally, it is proposed to adjust the clock headway pattern of the E-Line in the AM and PM
peak periods in the reverse peak directions (southbound in the AM, northbound in the PM) on
Mondays through Fridays, to coincide with the C-Line schedule adjustments. Trains will be
scheduled 15 minutes earlier/later than they are now. Two trips will be filled with additional ELine trains. No operating hours savings or additions are anticipated with this change.
H-Line
It is proposed to discontinue the 4:32 AM northbound trip from Nine Mile Station on Sundays and
Holidays. This affects 40 passengers. Savings are estimated to be $16,100 annualized.

W-Line
It is proposed to add a base train in the W-Line schedule to improve service reliability, increase
operator recovery time and allow for midday car cuts at Jefferson County Government CenterGolden Station. No impact to the public schedule besides adjustment in the early morning and
late night trips, plus an additional in-service pullout train in the early morning.

Change to summer schedules

2.B.3.a

It is also proposed to discontinue 16 Monday-Friday trips in the AM and PM peak periods:
Eastbound trips from Federal Center Station at 7:01 AM, 7:31 AM, 8:01 AM, 3:31 PM, 4:46 PM,
5:16 PM, 5:46 PM, and 7:01 PM and Westbound trips from Union Station at 6:41 AM, 7:11 AM,
7:41 AM, 2:41 PM, 4:26 PM, 4:56 PM, 5:26 PM, and 6:11 PM. This service reduction would
result in the W-Line having a peak period frequency similar to that of the D-Line (10-15 minutes),
but still more frequent than all other individual light rail lines currently operating in the RTD
system. This proposed change effects approximately 789 passengers that will need to take a WLine 7.5 minutes earlier or later. Additionally, a third car will be added to the busiest W-Line peak
period trips.
The 10:18 PM westbound trip from Union Station on Sundays is proposed to be terminated at
Federal Center Station instead of Jefferson County Government Center-Golden Station. This
affects 5 passengers.
The 4:30 AM eastbound trip from Federal Center on Saturdays/Sundays/Holidays is proposed to
be discontinued and the 5:02 AM eastbound trip from Jefferson County Government CenterGolden on Saturdays and Sundays is proposed to start at Federal Center Station at 5:11 AM.
This affects 53 passengers. Savings estimated to be $639,000 annualized
Union Station Hostlers
It is proposed to cancel the Saturday and Sunday Union Station hostlers and reduce the additional
Monday-Friday Union Station hostler work, in concert with the W-Line improvements. Savings are
estimated to be $693,750 annualized.
Light Rail School Trippers
The D-Line and H-Line school trippers, train 14 and 57, Mondays through Thursdays, will
be canceled for the summer as per traditional practice. This includes the northbound DLine trip at Mineral Station at 7:13 AM and the northbound H-Line trip at 7:12 AM.

Proposed Service Changes for May 2015 runboard

In addition there were 3 people who attended, including former Board Member Dave
Ruckman.
Curtis Rogers
As a regular user of Route 9 he feels that the passengers would benefit if we could detour
to the Knox Station, as well as Holden Place, so passengers could better access to the W
line.
The stop E-bound at 10th farside of Federal is very poorly designed for ADA passengers.
He would like to see the route 9 continue to 10th Ave via Mariposa to better serve the 10th
& Osage Station.
More routine maintenance checks should be made on all Light Rail Station elevators.
Wouldn’t it be better for the Route 21 to short turn at Federal /Evans instead of Evans
Station?
We need to have a CnR service for the Downtown Littleton Area. The South Jeffco CnR
drivers will not go past Littleton Station. Littleton has very little service available.
Dave Ruckman
Originally the W line was slated for 5 minute headway, moving from a 7 ½ minute
headway to a 15 is a pretty serious change.
Mr. Ruchman has a friend who is blind who tries to use main stream transportation. When
he schedules a CnR bus he has to call ahead 24 hours and feels that it would be helpful if
he could try to schedule the CnR to pick him up and home, take him to more than one
location, so he could get more than one thing done on the same day. Has RTD ever
considered letting passengers set up 2 or more locations on the same trip?
He feels that in light of the growing economy this would be a very favorable time to
expand bus service. That Service Development should begin brain storming sessions,
looking at what other properties are doing around the country and possible implementing
new ideas for RTD to use to improve service.

Regarding Proposed Route 4:
 Commenter thanked RTD for meeting in the neighborhood and was an original rider
of the old Route 4. As a college student, she has had to walk 9 blocks with a
heavy backpack, occasionally missing her bus due to bad weather. She would love
to see the 4 return and offered assistance with a petition aimed at that goal.
 Commenter works with 9-to-5 Colorado and spoke regarding the difficult
transportation connections for community members between jobs and other
activities. She believes the 4 will open doors and hopes for better access cost-wise
for riders. She thanked RTD for coming to Westwood.
 Commenter is a new resident in Westwood and depends heavily upon access to
light rail service. Route 4’s proposed access to Alameda Station will allow better
access to resources and jobs throughout the metro region. He believed the bus
would provide increased safety to riders versus walking along Morrison Road.
 Commenter thanked RTD for coming to and being concerned about Westwood.
She usually rides Route 11, previously with small children and a stroller in tow.
She thanked RTD for considering reinstating Route 4 and appreciated the increased
safety the route would provide. She expressed concern that the service span might
be challenging for riders who work shifts ending after 8 P.M.
 Commenter is a transit coordinator with 9-to-5 Colorado.
She expressed
excitement about the conversations surrounding Route 4 and a possible circulator.
She looks forward to the return of Route 4 in May.
 Commenter expressed thanks for RTD’s efforts toward helping the redevelopment
of the Westwood community. She was grateful that the meeting was held in the
neighborhood instead of in downtown Denver. She was concerned about the
limited service span, but felt the route would help avoid dangerous incidents along
Morrison Road.
 Commenter represents West Unidos. She spoke regarding how a lack of bus
service in Westwood previously limited access to work. She expressed pleasure in
the increased service on Route 4 and the improved access to businesses and
additional grocery shopping options along Sheridan Boulevard.
 Commenter thanked RTD for being in the neighborhood and for bringing back Route
4 to the community. She is happy to see the route return and believes it will help
bring renewal to the neighborhood.
 Commenter thanked RTD for holding the meeting and believes that reinstating
Route 4 will help residents who have children better access locations on the east
side of Federal Boulevard.

Doug explained the format for the evening’s meeting and opened the floor to questions not
specifically pertaining to the proposed service changes. The question of a local circulator
was raised. It was explained that RTD is prepared to provide the community its technical
expertise for this project, but no financial resources were available to support a circulator.
Several other community members asked questions about the proposed Route 4, at which
time Doug transitioned the meeting to the public input session. The following comments

Jessie explained the format for the afternoon’s meeting and opened the floor to comments
pertaining to the proposed service changes. No comments were received regarding
service changes to the W Line or to Route 4, at which time Jessie transitioned the meeting
to the public input session. The following comments were received:
Regarding Alameda Avenue:
 Commenter questioned when construction was planned to conclude at Alameda
Station so that better access would be provided to light rail. Staff responded that
unexpected delays were encountered and an exact completion date remains
unknown.
Regarding Stop Amenities:
 Commenter questioned whether the beautiful bus stops on West Colfax could also
be available for the Broadway corridor. Staff explained that these amenities were
not provided by RTD but rather the neighborhood association.
Regarding the Proposed Discontinuation of Route DD:
 (Commenter is hearing-impaired and communicated via an ASL interpreter.)
Commenter indicated she has ridden RTD since 1974 and could serve as a poster
child for the bus. She is disappointed in the DD route (Boulder / Colorado Blvd)
being discontinued. She serves clients at the VA hospital all week and is
concerned about a client who will now need to take five different buses to travel to
the VA. The commenter expressed concern that Boulder workers could get hurt by
traveling at 4 A.M. due to the extra travel time required by the loss of the DD. She
also expressed concern in the number of retiring operators being replaced by newer

Regarding Transfers and Fare Structure:
 Extending the validity of a transfer will increase transit ridership.

2.B.3.b

Regarding Route 100:
 Commenter frequently uses RTD to travel to appointments near the C470/Kipling
interchange. She suggested that Route 100 be extended to that interchange to
eliminate the need for a transfer. She stated this would likely increase ridership.
Regarding Route 38:
 Commenter expressed concern about the on-time performance of Route 38 from
18th/Stout between 5:00 and 7:00 P.M. He shared that riders are giving up on the
late route and have begun to drive their own vehicles instead. Staff replied that an
analysis of Route 38 would be carried out for the May 2015 runboard.
Regarding Route 6 and Local Fares:
 Commenter travels frequently between 17th/Blake and 10th/Grant in Denver. She
expressed concern regarding the disparity between the fare paid for this short trip
and an equal fare for a trip of considerably greater length. She recommended the
use of a downtown circulator within a two-mile radius or between Union Station
and 30th/Downing Station. She questioned the source of RTD’s service component,
wondering if paying more for less represented good customer service. She also
requested information regarding how to identify her neighborhood’s director.
Regarding Facilities for the Hearing Impaired at Union Station:
 (Commenter is hearing-impaired and communicated via an ASL interpreter.)
Commenter expressed concern about the lack of a TTY telephone at Union Station.
She shared that the cashier on the bus concourse was unable to provide her
assistance and raised concern for hearing impaired customers faced with
emergency situations at Union Station.

questioned RTD’s concern for its customers and suggested RTD consider smaller
buses instead of discontinuing routes.

Nate explained the format for the evening’s meeting and opened the floor to comments
pertaining to the proposed service changes. Since no attendees wished to discuss any
routes other than Route DD, the meeting transitioned to the public input session. The
following comments were received:
Regarding the Proposed Discontinuation of Route DD:
 Commenter indicated he has ridden the DD for years and views it as a beneficial
service for himself and others. Speaking on behalf of a 71-year-old disabled rider
unable to attend the meeting, the commenter described the burden placed upon this
rider were the DD to be discontinued. He suggested RTD consider a single daily
trip in each direction.
 Commenter has ridden the DD for 3 or 4 years. Prior to using the DD, he faced a
challenging commute on US 36. RTD alternatives to the DD would require starting
his day too early and ending it too late. He believes discontinuing the DD would
increase congestion on US 36 and agreed with the previous suggestion of a single
trip in each direction each day. The commenter works for a state agency and
believes wider use of the EcoPass would help increase ridership.
 Commenter wished to echo previous speaker and reminded RTD that the attendees
pay RTD taxes. First, he explained, the DD service was cut in half. Now it
consistently arrives late. Because many from Westminster board the DD, cutting
the service would inconvenience even more people. The commenter, an employee
at the Department of Health, drives to work 2-3 times per week and much prefers
the days when he commutes by bus and allows someone else to do the driving.
Removing the DD would be bad and the Way2Go solution would simply be an
additional inconvenience.
 Commenter works with CDOT off of Colorado Boulevard and believes the DD is a
great way to do perimeter routing. This helps relieve congestion focused in
downtown Denver. He observes congestion on other routes, stating that his wife
stands in line for 15-20 minutes to board the 120X. He recommends adding more
perimeter routing to reduce congestion, transfers, and walking.
 Commenter stated he attended a meeting regarding the DD over 3 years ago and
that a company did a study telling RTD to cut the DD to increase its cash reserves.
As a 19-year DD rider, he questions the decision to cut the DD when there are
more than enough people for one bus and the riders pay taxes to RTD. He stated
that he has tried alternatives to the bus, but wasn’t able to shorten his trip, even in
a personal vehicle. As a CDOT employee, he questions RTD’s desire to increase
congestion. CDOT provides EcoPasses, but people don’t use them. He questions
why the route would be canceled if people are willing to ride the bus

Commenter shared the story of a hearing-impaired passenger on the DD route who
is unable to drive. She expressed concerns about others who lack another means
of transportation and feared they might lose their jobs at one of the many
employers along Colorado Boulevard. Alternative transit options were mentioned,
but she expressed that Route 40 was not a good bus to ride. She does not want to
ride three buses instead of one and reminded RTD that many with disabilities would
be challenged by transfers.
Commenter asked if it was possible to view the analysis RTD completed to arrive at
the decision to discontinue the DD. Staff shared a brief explanation of the
subsidies per boarding for Route DD and indicated that the more detailed analysis
would be shared with interested attendees after the public comment period.
Commenter questioned whether a list of alternate routes was available for riders.
Staff offered suggestions for routings and their approximate travel times from
Boulder.
Commenter stated she liked the non-downtown routing of the DD.
Commenter stated that light rail was not a convenient alternative. He questioned
whether a compromise such as a smaller bus was possible. Staff briefly explained
the minimal difference in operating costs between smaller and larger coaches.
Commenter questioned if a single trip compromise was possible or if the route
could be continued further south on Colorado Boulevard to increase ridership. He
mentioned the route used to serve the Denver Tech Center.
Commenter questioned if the L could be extended to Colorado Boulevard.
Commenter questioned if Westminster to Colorado Boulevard could be an
alternative to running the DD all the way to Boulder. He said that driving to
Westminster or Church Ranch would be an option for many customers.
Commenter questioned why RTD would shut down the DD and increase congestion
on a roadway which was just improved.
Commenter suggested that RTD officials ride the DD to see where people actually
get on and off. Staff explained how, in addition to employee observations of
routes, automatic passenger counters provide RTD with boarding/alighting data.

Following an unanswered call for additional comments, the meeting was concluded at
approximately 6:35 P.M. Staff remained for approximately 30 minutes to answer
additional questions from attendees and share the cost and ridership analysis performed
for Route DD.

Equity Analysis
M AY 2 0 1 5 S E R V I C E C H A N G E S

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
In the pursuit of the provision of mass transit service in the Denver Metro Area, equity is a core principle of the
Regional Transportation District (RTD). An equitable mass transit system fairly distributes the benefits and
adverse effects of transit service without regard for race, color, national origin or low-income status. This
principle is detailed and reinforced by Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Environmental Justice.
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin in
programs receiving federal financial assistance. Specifically Title VI states, “No person in the United States
shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the
benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial
assistance.”
In 1994, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12898, which states that each federal agency “shall make
achieving environmental justice part of its mission by identifying and addressing disproportionately high and
adverse human health or environmental effects of its programs, policies, and activities on minority populations
and low-income populations.”
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial assistance
with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI and Environmental Justice. In this circular, the FTA
requires RTD to evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that exceed the established
major service change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a disproportionately negative
impact on minority or low-income populations.

Equity Analysis

2.B.3.d

SERVICE CHANGE PHILOSOPHY
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance, sustainable
transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different classes of service
have different expectations of performance. We continually adjust services in response to changes in ridership
and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. It is also our responsibility to identify services
that are underperforming and recommend modifications, curtailment or cancellation of service as warranted.
We utilize our official Service Standards to establish performance metrics by which we identify
underperforming services on a class of service basis.

…The general assembly further finds that the district should be organized efficiently, economically,
and on a demand-responsive basis and that the district should consider least-cost alternatives in
discharging its responsibilities. The general assembly further finds that the farebox recovery ratio of
the district must be improved so that resources once allocated for mass transportation can be
made available for other surface transportation needs.
Colorado Revised Statutes 32-9-119.7. Farebox Recovery Ratios – Plans

ANALYSIS
The FTA also requires that RTD establish policies that will guide the analysis of the Accordingly, RTD has
established equity analysis policies to meet this requirement and establish a service evaluation process.

Equity Analysis Policies
Per FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Major Service Change policy, a Disparate
Impact policy and a Disproportionate Burden policy. Collectively, these policies provide foundational
requirements for evaluating service change proposals for equity. These policies and their applicable
thresholds are listed below:
1. Major Service Change Policy: A major service change is defined as a 25% addition or reduction in the
service hours of any route that would remain in effect for twelve (12) or more months. All major
service changes will be subject to an equity analysis which includes an analysis of adverse effects.
a. Adverse Effect: is defined as a geographical or temporal reduction in service which includes
but is not limited to: elimination of a route, shortlining a route, rerouting an existing route and
an increase in headways. RTD shall consider the degree of adverse effects, and analyze those
effects, when planning major service changes.
2. Disparate Impact Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a minority population
10% more than non-minority populations; this level of impact is considered a disparate impact.
3. Disproportionate Burden Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a low-income
population 10% more than non-low-income populations; this level of impact is considered a
disproportionate burden. A low-income population is a group of households who are at or below
150% of the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.

Equity Analysis

2.B.3.d

If a proposed major service change results in a disparate impact or a disproportionate burden, RTD will
consider modifying the proposed service change. RTD will then analyze the modification and make sure it
removed the potential disparate impact or disproportionate burden. If a less discriminatory option cannot be
identified and RTD can demonstrate a substantial legitimate justification for the proposed service change, the
FTA will allow RTD to proceed with the proposed change.

Proposed Major Service Changes
Pursuant to the intent to provide cost effective demand responsive services, RTD has proposed many service
changes to take effect in May of 2015. Per the Major Service Change Policy, the proposed major service
changes subject to this analysis are listed below.
Route 4 – New Route
It is proposed to reinstitute service on Morrison Road between Alameda Ave and Sheridan Blvd. Service will
run between Alameda Station and Sheridan/Evans via Alameda Ave, Morrison Rd, and Sheridan Blvd (please
see map, Attachment B). Peak frequency is proposed at 30 minutes, with midday and early evening service
offered every 60 minutes. Peak service will be offered from 5 a.m. to 8:30 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.
Evening service will extend to 8:00p.m.
Costs are estimated to be an annualized $258,300 and 2 peak vehicles
Route DD – Cancellation
Discontinue due to low ridership; average ridership per trip: 22 passengers; max load average: 15
passengers per trip; over half of the boardings (54+%) occur within Boulder along Broadway and along US
36, not along Colorado Boulevard; alternate route connections: BV/BF/BMX/BX, 86X to Union Station then
transfer to Light Rail to Colorado Station, or HX to Civic Center Station with transfer to Light Rail at 19th
Street and Stout Street, or Route HX to Civic Center Station with transfer to Routes 79L/83L.
Savings: Estimated to be $93,780 annualized

Equity Analysis Methodology
As previously mentioned, the basic framework for analyzing service changes for equity involves the
comparison of affected populations. The manner in which these populations are identified and compared is
described below:
1. Assess the proposed service change for adverse effects (e.g. frequency increase, shortlining, etc…)
2. Obtain applicable population or ridership data (e.g. customer satisfaction survey, census data, etc…)
3. Examine the proportions of adverse effects absorbed by minority and low-income populations.
Ideally, we would examine ridership data, as the demographics of the area in proximity to services do not
always reflect the demographics of those whom actually utilize the service in question. Unfortunately, RTD’s
most recent survey data is not statistically valid at the route level. In lieu of statistically valid ridership data,
we’ve elected to utilize U.S. Census population data to assess the impacts absorbed by minority and lowincome populations. Below are a series of tables depicting the two services in questions, the nature of the
service changes and demographic data from the 2010 Census depicting the level of impact. We also utilized
Geographic Information System (GIS) maps to view this data geographically and included in Appendix A.

Equity Analysis

As mentioned previously, our primary objective within this analysis is to examine proposed major service
changes to ensure minority and low-income populations are not more adversely effected than the service area
as a whole. The Census demographic data shows the percentages of minority and low-income populations in
proximity to the Route DD do not exceed the thresholds of the aforementioned policies. The data also
illustrates the reinstatement of the Route 4 as an effective service increase, benefiting a geographic area with
above average concentrations of minority and low-income populations. Therefore, no disparate impact and
disproportionate burden was identified and the proposed major service changes do not require revision.

Proposed US 36 BRT Service Plan

1 INTRODUCTION

The US 36 corridor has a notable history of providing commute-oriented transit service.
From 1908 to 1926, passengers could travel between Denver and Boulder on the Denver
& Interurban Railroad (D&I) commuter rail line. Interurban train travel was eventually
replaced by bus service and consolidated under the Regional Transportation District (RTD).
Today, RTD operates a number of Regional and Express services on the US 36 corridor.
The Denver region has experienced considerable population and employment growth in
recent years which has had an impact on the corridor. Traffic congestion continues to
increase, leading to longer travel times and a greater demand for more efficient public
transit.
The US 36 Managed Lanes/Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Project seeks to address US 36 traffic
congestion issues through physical highway improvements and transit service
enhancements. The project involves physical improvements such as the partial
reconstruction of US 36 and the addition of two managed lanes. These managed lanes will
extend the existing HOV lane for high-occupancy vehicles and will also allow singleoccupancy vehicles to utilize the lanes by paying a toll. The construction project also adds
queue jump lanes at interchanges that serve the bus stations. The managed lanes and
queue jump lanes will improve BRT operations by incrementally reducing travel times and
increasing service reliability. The project will also include improvements to the existing US
36 bus stations, such as the construction of new shelters, and added RTD operational
funding; all to further enhance regional transit service along the US 36 corridor between
Denver and Boulder.

1.2 INFORMATION SOURCES
The majority of the ridership data is from the January-May 2014 which precedes the
opening of Denver Union Station (DUS) on May 9, 2014 which replaced Market Street
Station as a terminal in downtown Denver. All routes that had previously served Market
Street Station were rerouted to serve the new facility. Additionally, RTD implemented Free
MetroRide, a free downtown distributor connecting DUS and Civic Center. This data is the
most recent, complete set of data that provides the information necessary for analyzing
boardings, alightings, and passenger loads. In this dataset, Market Street Station is the
primary terminal in downtown Denver. The schedules reflect the opening of DUS and were
used to determine current service levels, patterns, and travel times.

Attachment: Proposed US 36 Service Plan.. (2239 : Proposed US 36 Service Plan)

1.1 BACKGROUND

Information on the existing and proposed changes to the US 36 corridor came primarily
from the following sources:
 US 36 Corridor Final Environmental Impact Statement
 Colorado Department of Transportation Roadway Layout Plans
 US 36 Mayors/Commissioners Coalition Service Level Memo
 US 36 Managed Lane Concept of Operations
 US 36 2014 Fact Sheet
 RTD 2014 ridership data and schedules

Proposed US 36 BRT Service Plan

2 EXISTING CONDITIONS

The US 36 corridor connects Boulder and downtown Denver via six stations along US
Highway 36: Westminster Center, Church Ranch, Broomfield, Flatiron, McCaslin, and
Table Mesa. These stations are accessible using highway on-ramps, off-ramps, or bus only
lanes. Denver Union Station (DUS) is the primary terminal for routes in downtown Denver.
Downtown Denver features a high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) flyover ramp which allows
transit vehicles to access the corridor via Interstate 25. The HOV ramp is a one-way,
reversible lane that is available heading eastbound towards downtown Denver from 5:00
AM to 10:00 AM and heading westbound towards Boulder from 12:00 PM to 3:00 AM.
During off-peak periods when the flyover is closed, buses utilize Park Avenue and
Wewatta Street to access Interstate 25.
Regional transit services have a few configurations for travelling through Boulder after
Table Mesa. Most routes on the corridor will terminate at Boulder Transit Center via Table
Mesa Drive and Broadway Street with a connection to the University of Colorado Boulder.
A second, peak period only travel path, involves buses continuing westbound on US 36
traveling to East Boulder via 28th Avenue.

2.2 CURRENT BUS SERVICE
2.2.1 Route Descriptions
The US 36 corridor is currently served by a total of thirteen routes: AB, BF, BMX, BV, BX,
DD, DM, HX, L, LX, S, T, and 86X (see Figure 1 - Existing US 36 Service Patterns by
Route). All of these routes operate with high capacity, highway coaches, except for the
86X which utilizes high capacity, articulated buses. Routes AB, L, and LX will not be a
part of the service plan recommendations but are evaluated as part of the existing
conditions analysis.
The four B routes, BV, BF, BMX, BX, each represent a different pattern between Boulder
Transit Center and Denver Union Station. BV is the all-stop service, providing a connection
to each of the six stations as well the local stops between Table Mesa and Boulder Transit
Center. BV operates all day and is oriented towards the reverse-commute, heading
westbound to Boulder in the AM peak and eastbound to Denver in the PM peak. BMX and
BX are limited-stop express services that serve Boulder Transit Center, Table Mesa, and
McCaslin (BMX). These routes supplement BV service with each route operating a 15
minute frequency during the peak periods. BF is a short-line route that connects
Broomfield, Church Ranch, and DUS. BF is a peak period service that operates in the peak
direction, eastbound to Denver in the AM peak and westbound to Broomfield in the PM
peak.

2.1 CORRIDOR DESCRIPTION

Route 86X operates between Westminster Center and DUS. This route provides frequent,
peak only service, travelling eastbound during the AM peak and westbound towards
Westminster during the PM peak.

Routes S and HX are the only two routes that currently serve East Boulder. Route S
provides reverse-commute, peak period service between DUS and East Boulder while
Route HX offers passengers a peak-direction, alternative connection into downtown
Denver, terminating at Civic Center Station. This is the only route on the US 36 corridor
that serves Civic Center Station.

Routes L and LX connect Denver and Longmont. These primarily peak-oriented services
access the corridor via the stations at Westminster, Broomfield, and DUS.
Route AB provides SkyRide service to Denver International Airport (DIA) from Boulder
Transit Center serving Table Mesa, McCaslin, Broomfield, and Westminster.
The large number of routes complicates the corridor, making transit more difficult for
passengers to understand. Figure 2 - Existing Route & Stop Patterns - US 36 Corridor
presents the routes and their alignments. Passengers need to invest additional time in
order to understand the 13 routes and identify which services meet their mobility needs.

Transit on the US 36 corridor is largely commute-based with a large number of eastbound
and westbound weekday trips taking place during the AM peak (6:00 AM – 8:59 AM) and
PM peak (3:00 PM – 5:59 PM). Many of these trips emphasize the peak direction, heading
eastbound towards downtown Denver during the AM peak, and westbound towards
Boulder during the PM peak (see Figure 3 - Total Weekday Trips by Time Period (January
2014 Schedule)). The B routes account for about 65 percent of the total weekday trips
along the corridor. During the midday (9:00 AM – 2:59 PM) the number of trips is nearly
half of the number of trips during each peak period. As expected, the early AM period
(5:00 AM – 5:59 AM) has the least amount of trips. During the PM evening (6:00 PM –
7:59 PM) period there are more trips operating compared to the PM late period (8:00 PM –
10:59 PM).

The majority of the peak period routes operate a limited number of trips while the B routes
and Route 86X operate at more consistent service levels (see Figure 4 - Weekday Route
Frequencies by Time of Day (January 2014 Schedule)). Route BV supports the westbound
reverse-commute operating a 10 minute frequency to Boulder and a 30 minute frequency
to Denver during the AM peak. This pattern is reversed during the afternoon peak. BMX
and BX provide additional capacity along the corridor with a 10-15 minute frequency
during the peak and 60 minute service during the midday in both directions. Route 86X
operates a 10 minute frequency between Westminster and DUS in the peak period and
peak direction. The remaining services run less frequently.

2.2.3.1 Weekday

Routes serving the US 36 corridor generate more than 10,000 average weekday boardings
(see Figure 7 - Total Weekday Boardings per Route). The B routes, which provide all-day,
frequent service, account for 55 percent of this total. No other route besides Route AB
contributes more than 10 percent of the total ridership. Route 86X and its high frequency,
peak direction service contributes about 9 percent of the ridership.

Route HX has experienced an increase in ridership following the opening of DUS. This shift
in ridership may be the result of passengers wanting to preserve a one seat ride to
destinations between Union Station and Civic Center Station. The chart below does not
reflect this recent increase in ridership, but RTD scheduled two additional Route HX trips
August, 2014. RTD will continue to monitor changes in ridership activity as passengers
acclimate to this transition and make adjustments as needed. Figures 8 and 9

Productivity is an important metric for comparing performance across routes. Overall, the
range of boardings per trip is fairly compact. Figure 12 - Average Weekday Boardings per
Trip details the boardings per trip by route. Routes AB, BV, HX, LX, and 86X have the
highest productivity, generating more than 34 boardings per trip. Routes T and DD are on
the opposite end of the productivity spectrum with fewer than 25 boardings per trip.
These two routes have destinations other than Downtown Denver terminating at the
Denver Tech Center and Colorado Boulevard, respectively; lower frequencies and limited
demand for service to these areas adversely impact their performance. Route BX, which
offers the express service between Boulder and downtown Denver, generates the fewest
boardings per trip amongst the B routes, reflecting slightly lower usage for the longest
distance trips.

Boardings per revenue hour provide another perspective for understanding productivity and
route performance (see Figure 13 - Average Weekday Boardings per Revenue Hour). It
measures ridership generated per unit of service, making it possible to compare the
performance of routes with greatly differing ridership and service levels.
By this
productivity measure, performance varies significantly by pattern. Route 86X is the most
productive route on the US 36 corridor. Route 86X generates boardings that are
comparable to Routes BV and BMX, but in a much shorter amount of time. The regional
routes with destinations other than DUS have significantly lower productivity when
accounting for revenue hours. There is an opportunity to improve performance on the
corridor by reallocating less productive resources.

2.3 STATIONS
The US 36 corridor connects Boulder and downtown Denver with service to six stations.
Figure 14 - US 36 Corridor Station Access/Attributes details how these stations differ in
their services, amenities, and transit needs and usage. Routes serving the corridor vary in
their terminal locations, but the primary hubs in downtown Denver and Boulder are DUS,
Civic Center Station, and Boulder Transit Center. A transit center at 33rd and Pearl is
currently under construction in East Boulder and is anticipated to be open when the US 36
Corridor BRT service commences in early 2016.

2.4 LOAD ANALYSIS BY ROUTE AND STATION
Analyzing the passenger loads of the existing US 36 services is essential for understanding
capacity issues and effectively allocating resources to meet actual demand. There are two
charts that comprise the load analysis for Routes BV, BMX, BX, BF, HX, and 86X (services
that generate some of the highest boardings on the corridor). The bar charts below present
the total number of boardings and maximum load per trip. While the seated capacity of the
bus is 57, a maximum scheduled capacity of 50 is used as a threshold to afford a small,
but reasonable buffer to accommodate daily variability in passenger loading and traffic
perturbations without incurring standees. The load analysis evaluates corridor activity to
understand how passengers use the US 36 services and determines where loads are the
highest by station and time of day. The line charts below present average load calculated
for each route and stop representing boardings and alightings as they occur along the

Proposed US 36 BRT Service Plan

An analysis of Figure 15 - AM Peak Eastbound Boardings (Weekday) trips in time order and
Figure 16 - AM Peak Eastbound Loads (Weekday) for the AM peak eastbound direction
leads to the following observations:
 The maximum load measurement is used to assess utilization on a trip-by-trip basis.
A pattern of higher loads indicates a potential need for additional capacity. The
corridor currently features sufficient capacity: only one out of more than 200 trips
averaged a maximum load above seated capacity.
 No trip was subject to overload issues during the AM peak heading eastbound.
 On average, no route experiences a maximum load above the seating capacity
 Route 86X experiences a significant amount of sustained passengers activity
throughout the AM Peak, thus its capacity should be maintained.
 Route BV experiences the greatest amount of seat turnover throughout the corridor.
Route BF ridership is greatest on the first trip of the AM Peak at 6:15 AM, which is
likely due to the fact that there are fewer B trips overall operating during this time
 Even though Routes BV and 86X both go express to downtown Denver from
Westminster station, people may be choosing the latter route due to its higher
frequency service.
 Stations stops located further away from downtown Denver experience
significantly higher ridership on the routes that provide faster, more express
services. Riders at Table Mesa and McCaslin prefer the faster service resulting in
lower BV ridership at these stations (BV also operates less frequently, which also
contributes to the lower ridership during this time). At the local stops in Boulder the
passenger load is greater on BX which has one less stop than BMX.

1/5/2015

route. The distance between station stops is scaled proportionally and an increase in the
line at a station represents a net load increase where boardings were greater than
alightings, and conversely for a decrease. These data help identify trips and time periods
where bus capacity is an issue.

Trips heading westbound to Boulder during the AM Peak are considered reverse-commute
trips and an analysis of similar charts leads to the following observations. There are fewer
boardings than the peak direction and the trips average 30 boardings per trip, none coming
close to reaching seating capacity of 57. Routes BMX and BX average approximately 25
boardings per trip; on average, these express trips carry less than half a bus load. Similar

to the eastbound direction, passengers traveling further distances select the faster routes.
Ridership on Route BV increases at each subsequent station until reaching Table Mesa
where alightings begin to outpace boardings.

Routes BV, BX, and BMX provided midday service westbound towards Boulder, with BV
operating a 30 minute frequency supplemented by 60 minute service on either BX or BMX.
The two BX trips average 20 boardings per trip making the service underutilized. Route
BV experiences high seat turnover, generating its highest ridership volumes during this
time period. Loads are similar between Routes BMX and BV leaving downtown Denver;
Route BX loads are small leaving downtown Denver.
Service in the PM Peak heading eastbound to Denver is split between Routes BV, BX, and
BMX. Route BV has especially high ridership in the hour between 3:00 PM and 5:00 PM;
the 4:30 PM trip generates more than 70 boardings and its max load is close to seating
capacity. Routes BX and BMX trips do not come close to reaching the maximum seating
capacity of the bus. The majority of passengers on Route BV are using the service to
access intervening stations and not downtown Denver; passengers are using Routes BMX
and BX very similarly.
Figure 17 - Westbound Boardings (Weekday) and Figure 18 - PM Peak Westbound Loads
(Weekday) depict ridership during the westbound PM peak direction to Boulder, leading to
the following observations:
 Ridership in the PM Peak heading out to Boulder is high with loads exceeding
seating capacity on one 86X trip that departs around 5:00 PM (See Figure 17 Westbound Boardings (Weekday))
 Ridership is lowest on Route BF which duplicates most of Route BV’s alignment
towards Broomfield
 Routes BV and 86X should have no discernible travel time difference between
downtown Denver and Westminster since they have the same stop configuration,
however, Route 86X has a substantially higher average load (See Figure 36)
o This continues to demonstrate the importance of frequency on the US 36
corridor
o Riders prefer the 86X since this route maintains the more predictable
schedule with a consistent 10 minute frequency
 Route BMX and BV share similar loads from downtown Denver before reaching their
first stops
 Route BF is a lower frequency service and averages the lowest load among the B
routes
 The ridership and load patterns indicate that there is demand for express service at
Broomfield, McCaslin, and Table Mesa during the PM peak

1/5/2015

Attachment: Proposed US 36 Service Plan.. (2239 : Proposed US 36 Service Plan)

During the midday, heading eastbound to Denver, service alternates between BV and BX
with a frequency of approximately every 30 minutes. No trips are at seating capacity.
Route BV experiences significantly higher ridership than BX and max load figures show
that there is significant seat turnover on Route BV which indicates the route’s role as an
intra-corridor connector. Riders take the first bus that arrives at their stop.

2.5 TRAVEL TIME SAVINGS: EXPRESS VS. LOCAL
Overall travel time and reliability is an important part of maintaining a competitive transit
service. This is one of several components of the passenger experience that can help
attract and maintain ridership.

Proposed US 36 BRT Service Plan

In the AM peak, heading eastbound to DUS from Boulder Transit Center, Route BV has an
average scheduled running time of 60 minutes (see Figure 19 - Weekday Travel Time
Savings Eastbound). The average running time of Route BV was calculated without the
two minute hold at Broomfield, which has been removed in the final service plan
recommendations. This route serves all stations on the US 36 corridor. Route BMX and
BX, the regional services between Boulder and Denver that by-pass selected stops, have
average scheduled run times of 48 and 44 minutes, respectively. Riders that select Route
BMX or BX at Boulder, Table Mesa, or McCaslin save more than 12 minutes of travel time
compared to Route BV. The difference in run time between Route BMX and BX is four
minutes with one additional stop for Route BMX. The four minute difference in travel time
between Route BMX and BX is expected to be less when the McCaslin slip ramps are
constructed for the BRT service. The difference in run time between Route BF and BV to
and from Broomfield and downtown Denver is negligible with a one minute difference
resulting from the additional stop at Westminster Center on Route BV. These trends
continue during the midday and PM peak.
Due to the current non-bidirectional HOV lanes, travel times for all routes are longer in the
PM peak as compared to the AM peak and midday time periods. Riders that select either
Route BMX or BX at the northernmost stations during the PM peak experience a travel
time savings of over 11 minutes in comparison with Route BV.

2.5.2 Westbound Travel Time Analysis
A similar analysis shows the scheduled savings in travel time heading westbound toward
Boulder is less significant when compared to routes heading eastbound. Riders that select
either Route BMX or BX to travel to the northernmost stations during the AM peak are
scheduled to save an average of five minutes to twelve minutes compared to Route BV.
Riders that select Route BMX to reach Boulder during the PM peak save eight minutes.
Overall, the differences in running time between a limited-stop and all-stop service from
Boulder to downtown Denver is significant, but the differences in running time between
similar patterns, Route BX/BMX and Route BV/BF, may not be significant enough to
warrant four different patterns. Additionally, while there is value in limited-stop service and
shorter travel times, route frequency will be another factor in passenger decision making.
Passengers will have less incentive to specifically choose a limited-stop service over the
all-stop service at lower frequencies. Any reductions in travel time savings may be offset
by increases in out-of-vehicle wait times.

3 SERVICE LEVELS AND ENHANCEMENTS
3.1 ESTABLISHED MINIMUM SERVICE LEVELS
In a 2012 memo to the US 36 Mayors/Commissioners Coalition (MCC), RTD established
the minimum weekday peak and off-peak service levels that each station will receive when
the BRT corridor opens (see Figure 21 - MCC Memo Peak Service Levels (Weekday)).
These levels were established for four stations including Boulder (from Table Mesa
Station), McCaslin, Broomfield, and Westminster Center.

The existing service levels developed for the MCC Memo were based on the conditions in
2012. Since that time, a number of changes have been made to service levels on the US
36 corridor. This service plan updates the existing service levels outlined in the memo to
reflect today’s conditions in 2014.
The 2014 service levels account for the opening of DUS and include Routes BF, BMX, BV,
BX, DD, DM, HX, S, T, and 86X. Routes AB, L, and LX were not included in the service
level calculations as service plan recommendations will not be provided for these routes.

3.2 ENHANCEMENTS AND INVESTMENTS
The US 36 BRT Project will include the partial reconstruction of US 36 and the addition of
two new high-occupancy vehicle (HOV/HOT) lanes between Table Mesa and
Pecos/Westminster. These managed lanes will extend the existing HOV lane, reducing
travel times and increasing service reliability from Pecos/Westminster to Table Mesa. Since
the Managed Lanes are located on the left side of the highway, they will be used for
limited stop routes.

Buses will be allowed to use the 12 foot right shoulder lanes during congested periods
when highway speeds in the general lanes are less than 35 miles per hour. The maximum
allowable speed for buses operating on the shoulder is 15 miles per hour above the
traveling speed of traffic in the general lanes, up to a maximum of 35 mph. Use of the

Proposed US 36 BRT Service Plan
right Shoulder Lanes will create a more efficient and reliable schedule and will improve
safety by reducing the need for buses to merge across congested lanes of traffic.
Broomfield and McCaslin will have bus only slip ramps that give transit vehicles dedicated
access for re-entering the highway, which reduces station stop delay. Buses serving the
Westminster, Church Ranch, and Flatiron stations must exit and re-enter the highway with
general traffic. The project will also include the reconfiguration of the existing US 36 bus
stop stations, construction of new shelters, and addition of queue jump lanes.

4 FRAMEWORK AND GUIDING PRINCIPLES
The customer experience is a key element of service design and delivery. In order for
transit to successfully generate ridership on the corridor, RTD must be able to offer a
service that is convenient, easy to understand, and easy to use. RTD can positively shape
the passenger experience with improved travel times, service reliability, and marketability.
The proposed service plan directs RTD’s resources for the corridor in a manner that
maximizes benefits for the agency and its customers. Ridership growth will come from
current customers making new trips; improved retention of current customers; and new
customers from emerging markets who are attracted to the improved services. The
proposed service plan will fulfill RTD’s commitments to the corridor.

4.1 REDUCE TRAVEL TIMES
Passenger travel times consist of two components: out-of-vehicle wait time and in-vehicle
travel time. Both of these aspects are critical determinants for growing ridership and
should be viewed as complimentary pieces.
Industry experiences have shown that out-of-vehicle wait times are quite important to
passengers. RTD will implement spontaneous use headways where supported by existing
or potential ridership volumes. With spontaneous use frequencies, customers know that
service is frequent enough that they can simply arrive at a transit stop to board the next
bus without needing to consult the schedule. At lower frequencies, passengers typically
schedule their arrival at the stop; they attempt to minimize uncertainty by arriving at a bus
stop earlier than they would for a higher frequency service. Industry best practices have
established 15 minute frequencies as the outer threshold for spontaneous use service with
10 minutes or better being the ultimate goal.
In-vehicle travel time is dependent on a number of factors which include operating speed,
traffic congestion, and dwell time. Operating speeds are expected to incrementally improve
with the managed and shoulder lanes as well as the enhanced station access/egress along
US Highway 36. Dwell times will be reduced by eliminating any scheduled holds for BRT
service on the corridor; the regional service should not hold at stations for local routes.
The local routes should be coordinated with the regional service. The service plan will aim
to provide frequent service that minimizes the impact of out-of-vehicle wait times.
Additionally, the service plan seeks to streamline service patterns based on impact to
ridership and dwell times.

Attachment: Proposed US 36 Service Plan.. (2239 : Proposed US 36 Service Plan)

RTD will purchase 59 new over-the-road buses with a 57 seat per bus capacity for the US
36 corridor.

Packet Pg. 129

2.C.1.b

Proposed US 36 BRT Service Plan

4.2 IMPROVE SERVICE RELIABILITY

Use of the managed lanes and shoulder lanes will improve overall schedule reliability by
reducing variance in the travel times. With improved frequencies on the corridor, buses will
have more flexibility in responding to unforeseen incidents. If a disruption in service
occurs, an improved frequency will mean that customers will have less time to wait for the
next bus to arrive.

4.3 INCREASE CUSTOMER COMPREHENSION/EASE OF USE
RTD will be offering a high level of service on the corridor when the BRT project is
implemented. However, the agency will need to effectively communicate both the quantity
and the quality of this service. RTD can accomplish this by making the system more
marketable and easier to understand. Ease of use encompasses multiple aspects of the
system from the service patterns to the fare structure.
There are presently 13 existing routes providing regional transit service along the US 36
corridor with each route possessing a unique pattern of station stops. This configuration is
difficult to understand for first-time or occasional customers seeking to use the system.
Service on the corridor should be easy to understand; unproductive, infrequent patterns
should be consolidated or discontinued. Consolidating routes will make the transit system
easier to navigate and will help to reduce customer confusion.

4.4 MATCH SERVICE LEVELS WITH RIDERSHIP DEMAND
Transit on the US 36 corridor is currently oriented towards downtown Denver commutes.
As the shape and density of development along the corridor continue to change, RTD will
need a flexible US 36 plan that can respond to the evolving marketplace. More specifically,
RTD will need to better match service levels with ridership demand to ensure that the US
36 BRT service is successful and financially sustainable. The service evaluation identified
that there was a significant difference in productivity by route and pattern. The proposed
plan will use the findings from the service evaluation to identify high performing patterns
that warrant additional investment as well as lower demand patterns that warrant
adjustments in frequency.

5 PROPOSED SERVICE PLAN

Attachment: Proposed US 36 Service Plan.. (2239 : Proposed US 36 Service Plan)

Reliability is a key attribute in retaining ridership. In addition to improving travel times, the
lane treatments and enhanced station access/egress being provided on the corridor will
also improve reliability.

5.1 BRT SERVICE PATTERNS
The current service configuration is difficult to understand for new or occasional
passengers. The immediate strategy is to simplify the corridor by minimizing the number of
different services while providing spontaneous-use frequency where supported by market
demand. As a result, the resources for Routes BF, BMX, BV, BX, DD, S, T, and 86X have
been consolidated into five routes branded as the Flatiron Flyer: All Station Denver-Boulder

TC (All Station); Limited-Stop Denver-Boulder TC (Ltd); Denver-Westminster-Broomfield
(DWB); Boulder TC-Anschutz (DM); and Boulder Junction-Civic Center (BJCC). See Figure
22 - Proposed Service Patterns, Figure 23 - Proposed Frequencies (Weekday) and Figure
24 - Service Pattern Schematic. The BJCC supplements the All Station service among
Broomfield, Westminster Center and DUS, while the Limited-Stop provides speedier long
distance service among DUS, McCaslin, Table Mesa, and Boulder TC stations. The Boulder
Junction at Depot Square service will offer 15 minute, bi-directional service during the
peak periods to support the new development in east Boulder. Boulder-Anschutz (Route
DM) will remain unchanged from its present operation. The routes in the proposed service
plan each have a unique role and generate enough demand to warrant their inclusion on
the corridor. Figure 25 - Proposed Weekday Schedule Eastbound through Figure 28 Proposed Sunday Schedule detail the span and frequencies for each proposed service.

Proposed US 36 BRT Service Plan

5.2 BRT SERVICE LEVELS
Previously referred to as Route BV, the all-station service will operate with 15 minute, bidirectional frequencies along the US 36 corridor, serving all of the US 36 stations (See
Figure 25 - Proposed Weekday Schedule Eastbound and Figure 26 - Proposed Weekday
Schedule Westbound). The 15 minute frequencies will foster all-day, spontaneous use.
The routing of the new all-station service will remain unchanged from the existing Route
BV service. This route will be the spine of the corridor, providing passengers with a
spontaneous use, all day service in both directions. Passengers will know that this route
will connect them to any station on the corridor. This will set RTD up for success as the
demand for intra-corridor connectivity increases.
The all-station service is expected to utilize the Managed Lanes between Westminster
Center and DUS as well as between Cherryvale and McCaslin. At all other times, the allstation service will travel in the general lanes and will utilize the Shoulder Lanes when
traffic has slowed to less than 35 miles per hour.
Weekend service on the corridor will be provided exclusively by more frequent all-station
service since the market for limited-stop service is reduced on the weekend (See Figure 27
- Proposed Saturday Schedule and Figure 28 - Proposed Sunday Schedule). All-station
service will operate at 15 minute frequencies during the midday on Saturday and at 30
minute frequencies during the midday on Sunday.
The all station buses serve local stops between Boulder Transit Center and Table Mesa.
While these stops may add ridership, they also increase travel time and operating costs.
RTD and the City of Boulder will examine ridership along Table Mesa Drive and Broadway
to identify the costs and benefits of improved stop spacing and other transit priority
measures.

5.2.2 Denver-Westminster-Broomfield (DWB)
The corridor will also feature additional trips between Broomfield, Westminster Center, and
DUS during the peak periods in place of Routes 86X and BF. These short trips will operate
15 minute frequencies in the AM peak heading eastbound towards downtown Denver and
15 minute frequencies in the PM peak heading westbound towards Broomfield. Combined
with the All-Station and BJCC services, Westminster Center and Broomfield will average
12 trips per hour or service every 5 minutes during peak periods in the peak direction.

Attachment: Proposed US 36 Service Plan.. (2239 : Proposed US 36 Service Plan)

5.2.1 All-Station Denver-Boulder

Route 86X is currently the most productive route on the corridor. This connection between
Westminster and DUS will be maintained but the resources for this service will be rebranded to unify the corridor.
Integration with local bus service and Call-n-Ride service will be essential to provide for
improved connectivity at the station stops. Station stops at Westminster Center and
Broomfield possess the most local bus service on the US 36 corridor. Broomfield operates

31
Packet Pg. 133

2.C.1.b

Proposed US 36 BRT Service Plan

At Westminster Center, local routes currently share the same stop with Express and
Regional routes. The local routes will be reconfigured to utilize the space in the parking lot
or on the street, adjacent to the US 36 station stop, for passenger boardings and
alightings. This configuration would reduce traffic at the BRT station stop and would
facilitate a better flow of BRT vehicles through the stations, thereby reducing potential
delays and improving overall travel times while maintaining transfer proximity for the
connecting local services.

5.2.3 Limited (Ltd)
The limited route will connect DUS and Boulder Transit Center via McCaslin and Table
Mesa. This service will take on the role that is currently being filled by Routes BMX and
BX. An analysis of the existing conditions concluded that the ridership trends did not
support operating the two separate patterns. The limited route will provide 10 minute, bidirectional service during the AM and PM peaks.
Limited buses will use the new HOV/HOT managed lanes between Table Mesa and
Pecos/Westminster and the existing HOV/HOT lanes from there to Union Station. Under
free-running conditions the bus operator may choose to use the general purpose lanes
between Table Mesa and McCaslin.

5.2.4 Boulder-Anschutz (DM)
There are no proposed service pattern changes to Route DM. The route will remain
unchanged and will operate a 30 minute frequency in the peak direction only.

5.2.5 Boulder Junction at Depot Square-Civic Center (BJCC)
The Boulder Junction at Depot Square-Civic Center route (a combination of existing Routes
HX and S) will now also serve Westminster and Broomfield with 15 minute, bi-directional
service during the peak periods along the current HX routing on 28th Street in Boulder and
19th /20th Streets in Denver. Additional trips aim to serve demonstrated growth on the HX
and potential demand from land use development in Boulder. These service levels will be
monitored closely after service opens to determine if additional service is warranted, as the
current and potential demand is not sufficient to support higher frequency or broader
service span for opening day. The Flatiron and Church Ranch Station stops are the least
active stations on the US 36 corridor and are not proposed stops for opening day.

1/5/2015

Attachment: Proposed US 36 Service Plan.. (2239 : Proposed US 36 Service Plan)

on a pulse-based system with departures occurring at 5 and 35 minutes after the hour. In
order to improve operating speeds, the BRT service should not hold at any station. The
corridor will offer frequent service that will minimize out-of-vehicle wait times and local
services will be tailored to meet the BRT service, if necessary.

Proposed US 36 BRT Service Plan

5.3 LOCAL & OTHER SERVICES
With the implementation of US 36 BRT, the following adjustments to local and other
services are proposed, grouped by Park-n-Rides as well as the new Boulder Junction at
Depot Square within the City of Boulder.

5.3.1 US 36 & Table Mesa Park-n-Ride
Discontinue the route segment between Boulder Junction at Depot Square (BJDS) and
Boulder Transit Center due to low ridership averaging 8 passengers per service hour or 1.5
passengers per trip and duplicative service provided by Routes 205 and HOP. Increase the
frequency between BJDS and Flatiron Business Park to 15 minutes in the peaks. Boulder
Junction at Depot Square will be the new western terminal for this route. This is part of
the recently revised Boulder Transportation Master Plan. This change could occur as early
as August 2015 with the opening of 33rd & Pearl Transit Center.
5.3.1.2 Route 209 CU/Manhattan Circle

Discontinue the current route portion south of Baseline due to low ridership averaging 7
passengers per service hour or 1 passenger per trip.
5.3.1.3 Route 209X Table Mesa East Campus (NEW)

In coordination with the City of Boulder and the University of Colorado establish Route
209X from US 36 & Table Mesa Park-n-Ride to East Campus, via Foothills Parkway and
Colorado Avenue, to Innovation Dir. and Discovery Dr. The route will operate in the AM
and PM peaks only with 2-3 trips in each peak.

5.3.2 US 36 & McCaslin Park-n-Ride
When the planned development for both Superior Town Center and the area of South
Boulder Road and 96th Street occurs, RTD will consider changes to local services.
5.3.2.1 Route 228 Louisville/Broomfield

Discontinue the weekend short-turns between US 36 & Broomfield Park-n-Ride and
Flatiron Mall due to low ridership averaging 8 passengers per service hour or 2 passengers
per trip. In addition it is proposed to re-route the full-length trips on weekends through US
36 & McCaslin PnR in order to provide better connections to US 36 BRT.

5.3.3 US 36 & E Flatiron Center Park-n-Ride
No local route changes are proposed.
5.3.3.1 Route AB Boulder/Denver International Airport

Route AB will become SkyRide service from Boulder/Louisville/Superior directly to Denver
International Airport and not a US 36 BRT route. The route will operate via US 36 to US
36 & Flatiron Center Park-n-Ride East, NW Parkway/E-470, Pena Blvd to Denver
International Airport (DIA). The ABA is discontinued—Stapleton and Airport/40th will be
served by the A-Line when opened in 2016. Weekday frequency will be increased to halfhourly in the AM and PM peaks, alternating west-end trip terminals between Boulder
Transit Center and Boulder Junction at Depot Square. This would result in hourly peak
headways to both of these locations (peak CU demand will be accommodated as now with
supplemental trips).

Packet Pg. 139

2.C.1.b

Proposed US 36 BRT Service Plan

5.3.4 US 36 & Broomfield Park-n-Ride
No local route changes are proposed. Since the AB is discontinued from this station,
customers can take the Flatiron Flyer to Flatiron Station connecting to the AB to DIA
(takes slightly less travel time than currently). Development is scheduled to occur within
the area of this PnR, both on the east and west side of US 36, as well as within the
Interlocken Business Park. When this occurs, RTD will consider service changes as
appropriate and warranted.

5.3.5 US 36 & Church Ranch Park-n-Ride
5.3.6 US 36 & Westminster Center Park-n-Ride
No local route changes are proposed. Since the AB is discontinued from this station,
customers can take the NW Rail (or the Flatiron Flyer until the rail line opens) to Union
Station connecting to the A-Line to DIA (takes slightly longer travel time than currently).

5.3.7 Other Services
5.3.7.1 Boulder Junction at Depot Square

Boulder Junction at Depot Square is a new RTD facility that will be one of the termini
within the City of Boulder for US 36 BRT services. Routes HX and S will be consolidated
into the Route BJCC and will be rerouted and extended into Boulder Junction at Depot
Square from their current terminal at Pearl Street/ 29th Street for route HX, and Pearl
Street/49th Street for route S.
5.3.7.2 70th Avenue & Broadway Park-n-Ride

When the Routes DD and T are discontinued (alternative connecting routes will be
available), no regional routes will continue to serve this location. It is proposed to close
this Park-n-Ride with the opening of US 36 BRT due to very low usage on these routes
averaging a combined 15 passengers per day. Service connections for Routes 8, 31X and
72 will be provided on-street at the intersection of 70th Avenue and Broadway.

5.4 PROPOSED RESOURCES
The proposed service plan resources (see Figure 29 - Proposed Services Resources) results
in an increase of 10,429 annualized hours, or 10.7% more than current service. Peak
vehicle requirements of 49 are conservative and within the 59 vehicles (including spares)
being purchased, allowing for additional services as warranted. Actual resources will be
refined when schedules are produced.

Proposed US 36 BRT Service Plan

6 PROCESS & OTHER ISSUES

RTD is developing this service plan in concert with state, county, municipal and other
transportation stakeholders and customer and public input on the following schedule:
 Proposed US 36 Service Plan – January 8, 2015
 Stakeholder meetings to review proposed service plan – January 9 - February 10,
2015
 Review Proposed US 36 Service Plan with RTD Board Operations Committee –
February 10, 2015
 Revised Proposed US 36 Service Plan – March 9, 2015
 Conduct public meetings on Proposed US 36 Service Plan – March 16 - April 30,
2015
 Revised Proposed Service Plan based on public input – May 31, 2015
 Board approval of Final US 36 Service Plan – June 16, 2015
 Implement service plan – January 2016 (estimated)
This schedule provides time for substantial review and comment. The plan will be made
available on RTD’s website for the widest possible access. In addition RTD staff will be
available to make presentations to groups as a forum for detailed discussions. To request
a presentation please contact Nataly Erving at nataly.erving@rtd-denver.com or 303-2992059. Email comments should be sent to service.changes@rtd-denver.com with subject
line “US 36 Service Plan.”

6.2 CHANGES AFTER IMPLEMENTATION
With the implementation of major service changes such as this, RTD closely monitors
ridership response and operations to detect and remedy problems as soon as possible.
Trips that are overloaded or unable to make their schedule are typically addressed
immediately by supervisory staff with standby buses and within days with schedule
adjustments. Ridership and service patterns settle down in about 6 to 9 months after
implementation and RTD will recommend changes to take effect about one year after
opening.

6.3 ISSUES RAISED IN THE PUBLIC INPUT PROCESS
To be determined.

Memorandum

From: Bruce Abel, AGM Bus Operations
William Van Meter, AGM Planning
Lacy Bell, Planning Project Manager
Date: February 5, 2015
Subject: Fare Study Final Staff Recommendation
The fare study task force was able to develop a draft staff recommendation for the fare
structure and associated fare levels in a shorter timeframe than originally planned. As
such, we shared that draft recommendation with all of you at our small meetings the past
couple of weeks. We have incorporated the feedback from these meetings, while being
mindful of input from the public and stakeholders, to develop a final staff recommendation
to take to the public for formal input. This memo and the accompanying PowerPoint
presentation provide you with the background, rationale and next steps in the Fare Study.
Staff received valuable input and guidance during these meetings with you. There were
some recurring concerns and thoughts expressed at these meetings and this final staff
recommendation reflects the key common themes and goals articulated by many of you
during these discussions. Specifically, key differences from the draft recommendation that
are incorporated in the final staff recommendation, as well as some key observations are
outlined below:





Meets the Board adopted Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) fare revenue target, assuring
no need for service reductions as a result of fare revenue shortfalls.
Maintains the approach of eliminating transfers while establishing a Day Pass priced
at two times the single ride fare. This eliminates a major source of stress for RTD’s
passengers and operators while also helping to address a key concern regarding
affordability for many of RTD’s transit dependent and low income passengers. The
day pass will allow passengers to make multiple trips in a day for the same price as
a round trip, improving value and mobility options.
Avoids the negative cost impacts to Express passengers of the originally proposed
REX (Regional/Express) combined fare/service category, by restoring separate
Express and Regional fare/service levels for bus.

2.C.2.a

Increases bus and rail fares to/from Denver International Airport (DIA), compared
with the draft recommendation level, for cash-paying/non pass-holding customers better reflecting the value of this service. For regular DIA employee commuters this
recommendation maintains the current pricing approach of allowing passengers to
utilize a Regional monthly pass to travel to and from the airport. This
recommendation extends that option and will also allow employees to purchase a
Regional day pass and ride to or from the airport on bus or rail without any
additional charges.

We also presented the draft recommendation to many of our stakeholders at a local
government meeting that included community based organizations. We received positive
feedback about that recommendation specifically related to making a day pass widely
available on the bus at the price of two boardings. There were concerns voiced about the
increase in fares that current Express passengers would be required to pay if Express
routes were consolidated into the REX category. These comments generally aligned with
many of the comments that we heard from you.
The staff recommendation would result in an increase in EcoPass revenue of approximately
12% in 2016 per the 2009 Board approved EcoPass pricing agreement. The 2009
agreement states that the EcoPass pricing would increase the same percentage as a
general fare increase factored for ridership by service type until such time that EcoPass
pricing can be based on utilization data from the smart card. It is anticipated that smart
card data will be used to set contract prices for these programs beginning in 2017.
The next step for the study is public hearings where we will get formal input from the
public on the staff recommendation. We will hold 15 public hearings with one in every
Director District. Staff will report back to the Board on what we heard at the public
hearings as well as present the results of the Title VI equity analysis in April. You will be
able to use this input to make a decision on the fare structure and level policies to adopt
for implementation in January 2016.
In addition, staff will now focus on identifying opportunities for simplification of our pass
programs. Much of the attention during this phase will be on our Non-Profit Agency
Reduced Fare Program (low-income program). We understand and acknowledge that there
are challenges associated with the administration of the current program and many of the
people who the program is intended to help do not understand the requirements or that it
is an option. Our desire is to simplify and streamline this program. We will continue to
provide updates as progress is made on this front and will also provide information on
what other transit agencies around the country have done to address the needs of low
income passengers.

Service Performance 2013
Networked Family of Services

RTD’s Mission is: "To meet our constituents' present and future public transit needs by offering safe, clean,
reliable, courteous, accessible and cost-effective service throughout the district." Service development and
performance analysis require that we ask several questions. What are the markets or demand? Should service
be provided and how much? What type of service should be provided? RTD’s general approach is as follows.
Develop a family of services suited to a variety of markets. Connect all the services together in a network or
system to accommodate today’s dispersed travel patterns. Match the level-of-service with demand, thus
improving performance and sustainability.

Subsidy per Boarding or Effectiveness

Performance is a term often used interchangeably with effectiveness and efficiency. The effectivenessproductivity charts in this report present these measures for all RTD services. Effectiveness measures

the budget—and is presented on the y-axis as subsidy

Higher
Boardings per Vehicle Hour or Productivity
requirements for that service class. Minimums are
defined statistically to represent routes meeting or
exceeding 10% of the performance for all routes in each category. So this is a case where it’s bad to be
“outside the box.”
Routes that perform minimally get minimum service frequency, typically every 30 minutes during peak periods
and 60 minutes off-peak. The charts also depict guidelines for routes where ridership significantly exceeds the
minimum, and passenger loads justify more frequent service. The orange, dotted, vertical line at 25 boardings
per hour represents the typical minimum productivity for a route to justify 15-minute frequency, and the
green line at 40 boardings per hour for 10-minute frequency.

Please note that these are true apples-to-apples comparisons of performance: all fare revenues, boardings
and costs—both operating and amortized capital—are included. For complete, detailed information see RTD’s

• Boardings: Unlinked passenger trips; includes transfers as boardings.
• Hours: In-service vehicle hours, not including dead head garage time or layover/recovery.
• Fare Revenues: Cash, ticket, and tokens allocated by route by farebox recorded boardings. Monthly pass
revenues are allocated by class of pass and the number of uses by route. Revenue from Eco, CU, and Auraria
passes are allocated individually by the counts for each route weighted by the ratio of the class of service
fare to the local fare.
• Costs: All operating, maintenance and administrative costs for providing current service, plus depreciation
on all RTD assets. Excludes interest and any costs attributed to future projects. RTD’s cost allocation model
allocates costs to each route based on its miles, hours, and peak vehicles. Individual accounting line items
are assigned to the most relevant variable by the model.
• Subsidy: Costs minus Fare Revenues.
Standards
RTD has established guidelines in its Service Standards that the least productive 10% of routes based on either
subsidy per boarding or boardings per hour need to be evaluated for marketing, revision or elimination, or if
both measures fall below 25% for a route. The performance charts illustrate the acceptable performance
domain containing all routes meeting the 10% minimums for each class of service. The calculation of the 10%
and 25% standards are made from the annual, un-weighted data, assuming the data have a normal
distribution and using the appropriate formulas for standard deviation and confidence intervals; however, the
standard deviation is applied to the weighted average. The following table gives the current year weighted
averages and standards by class of service.

Notes on Routes Outside Their Acceptable Performance Domain

The following provides status as of December 2014, listed in route number order.

Route 9 West 10th Ave – Restructured April 2013 with the West Corridor restructuring. Its 22.3 boardings per
hour meets the ridership standard. We will continue to monitor this service
Route 26 West 26th Avenue – New service introduced April 2013 with the West Corridor restructuring. A
reassessment of the service class is needed, which may place this service in the Suburban category where it
would have acceptable ridership performance.
Route 31X North Federal – This route is only marginally below the standard and will continue to be monitored.
Route 32 West 32nd Ave/City Park — January 2012 service east of downtown was discontinued on weekends
and midday frequency reduced; discontinued night service west of downtown. The 2013 service meets the
boardings standard and is only slightly over the subsidy standard.
Route 34 West 3rd Avenue Commuter —This is a small route that has been restructured several times in
recent years and serves passengers with disabilities.
Route 45 Montbello/Green Valley Ranch – Significant portions of this route are under development;
performance will be monitored.
Routes 47X Green Valley Ranch/Montbello Express — This route was combined with the Route 48X Green
Valley Ranch Express for improved performance overall January 2012. This peak period only service will be
replaced by the Airport Line in 2016.
Route 50 Lakes Crosstown - This route was introduced with the West Line light rail service in April 2013. Its
ridership performance will be monitored and currently performs at 30.6 passengers per hour.
Route 54 Montbello Industrial Park — Trip reductions were made in 2013 and current ridership is 22
passengers per hour. This route will likely be restructured in 2016 with the East Corridor Service Plan.

Attachment: Performance 2013 Complete (2222 : Service Performance 2013)

Route 3 Ltd East Alameda — This is a well utilized route that easily meets the boardings per hour standard.
However, its subsidy per boarding is higher than most other CBD Local routes because the 3Ltd is a peak
period, peak direction only service and is thus more expensive to operate.

Route 79Ltd – This route was newly reinstated and it appears that it will meet standards in 2014.
Route 80X West 80th – This route is just marginally below standards and will continue to be monitored.
Route 100X South Kipling - Restructured April 2013 with the West Corridor restructuring.
Route 104 West 104th Avenue – Vehicle hours were added to this service to effect on-time performance,
resulting in a higher operation cost. We will continue to monitor the ridership performance.

Route 104X Commerce City/Denver Express – New grant funded service which began operating in January of
2013. Current ridership is 20 boardings per hour.
Route 116X South Simms – Restructured April 2013 with the West Corridor restructuring.
Route 209 CU/Table Mesa PnR – Route restructured with August 2013 service change.
Route 323 Skyline Crosstown — Restructured Longmont routes January 2013.

Route 401 Ranches Crosstown — Discontinued midday weekday and weekend service west of Mineral Station
and replaced with S Jeffco call-n-Ride January 2012. Service reduced in January 2014 as part of an effort to
optimize the level of service to better match ridership.
Route 403 Lucent Blvd — Service realigned and retimed for January 2014.
Route 410 Franktown/Parker — This route was substantially revised with the reinstatement of Route P
Parker/Denver spring 2007. Service was reduced to every 30 minutes peak and every two hours midday.
Service was reduced to peak period only May 2009. Additional trips added January 2014 in response to
public meetings where constituents noted that this would make the route more attractive. Will be
monitored for ridership response.
Route DD Boulder/Colorado Blvd —Due to declining ridership from the University Hospital move to AnshutzFitzsimons Medical Center, service has been steadily reduced for several years; it will eventually be
discontinued and fully replaced by the Route DM Boulder/Anshutz-Fitzsimons.
Route R/RC Brighton/Denver — Additional service was added in January 2011 to attract additional riders. This
route will be monitored for its performance.
Route T Boulder/Greenwood Plaza — This route was discontinued November 2006 with the opening of the
Southeast Corridor. Responding to customer complaints, the RTD Board reinstated the route in March
2007. This route will be restructured with the US 36 BRT services in 2016.
Route AA Wagon Road/DIA — Performance is just slightly below subsidy/boarding, but meets boarding/hour
standard. Will be monitored.

CCDC Agreement Securement Area Issues
Report

As you are aware, RTD and the Colorado Cross Disability Association (CCDC) entered into a joint
Settlement Agreement in an effort to resolve issues related to availability of the securement area on
board RTD buses for passengers who use mobility aids. One of the requirements of the Settlement
Agreement was for RTD to adopt a policy to ensure individuals who use mobility aids, including
wheelchairs, have equal access to its buses and to the securement area. The key components of this
policy are as follows:






Large items cannot block the aisle of the bus
Large items must be collapsed prior to boarding, and passengers must use the seats behind the
securement area for themselves and their items
If large items cannot be collapsed and stored behind the securement area, those passengers will
not be able to board the bus
Large items must be readily moveable and stowed behind the securement area
Passengers with mobility aids, such as wheelchairs, will be given priority boarding at bus stops

Starting with the effective date of the policy (March 22, 2014), RTD has been tracking 1) each incident
in which a bus operator pressed the “ADA PAX PASS-UP” button on board the bus and 2) each incident
in which a passenger complained that an operator had violated the policy. In accordance with one of the
reporting requirements of the Settlement Agreement, an initial report of the data collected for March 22,
2014, through April 20, 2014, was presented in May, 2014, to the Board of Directors and shared with
the CCDC and the Denver Regional Mobility Access Council (DRMAC) for posting on the DRMAC
website. Data for the remainder of 2014 (May through December) was to be presented in January of
2015. This report provides a summary of the securement area issues data for May through December of
2014. Included with this summary report is a detailed listing of all of the incidents reported for this
same time period.
The data collected for this report is generated in three ways – 1) the operator presses a pre-programmed
message button (“ADA PAX PASS-UP”) on the CAD/AVL radio system, 2) the operator makes radio
contact with RTD Dispatch using another button on the CAD/AVL radio system, or 3) a customer files a
report with the RTD Customer Care Division. Each incident generated by the above means is
investigated and tracked. The investigation includes a review of video from the bus (if available), a
review of the audio file documenting the conversation between the operator and the dispatcher, and a
report from the operator which includes a copy of the “ADA PAX PASS-UP” form given to the
passenger. Based on the results of the investigation, the securement area incident is assigned a code as
follows:
DUP

Duplicate – this indicates that the operator pressed the “ADA PAX PASS-UP” button
multiple times for the same incident

NPI

Not a Pass Up Incident – this indicates that one of the following occurred

Packet Pg. 195

2.C.4







The passenger was accommodated on this bus
The passenger boarded the following bus which was right behind this bus (no wait
time)
The passenger left the area
The operator pressed the button in error
The operator was asking a question about the policy or procedure

LIFT

Lift Inoperable – this indicates that the lift or ramp on the bus was not functioning as
required

2 W/C

2 Wheelchairs – this indicates that 2 passengers in wheelchairs were already occupying
the securement area

W/C+OMA

Wheelchair and Other Mobility Aid – this indicates that one passenger in a wheelchair and
a passenger using another mobility aid are already occupying the securement area

2 OMA

2 Other Mobility Aids – this indicates that 2 passengers using other mobility aids are
already occupying the securement area

PXO

Passenger Overload – this indicates the bus was standing room only and no one was
willing or able to move to make room

OTHER

These incidents include things like two passengers in wheelchairs want to travel together
but there is already one passenger in a wheelchair in the securement area or the flip seat
will not flip up

CSR

Customer Service Report – this indicates a report of a violation of the Policy was reported
to Customer Care

PENDING

This indicates the investigation into the incident is still in process

NO DATA

This indicates there was insufficient data available to verify that a passenger in a
wheelchair or other mobility aid was passed up

For the period of May through December of 2014, the breakdown of incidents is as follows:

Investigation pending
No data available

One additional statistic that was tracked was the number of times an operator pressed the lower priority
“Request To Talk” (RTT) button in order to contact Dispatch regarding a passenger pass up instead of
the high priority “ADA PAX PASS-UP” button. During the reporting period of 5/1/14 through 12/31/14,
operators used the RTT button 14 times. There were no incidents reported in October, November or
December where operators used the “RTT” button instead of the “ADA PAX PASS-UP” button.
The routes generating the highest number of pass-up incidents for the period of May, 2014, through
December, 2014, were as follows:
Route 15L – 56 incidents
Route 0 – 47 incidents
Route 52 – 43 incidents
Route 15 – 37 incidents
Route 16 – 37 incidents
Route 31 – 35 incidents
RTD carries an average of 472,000 passengers per month. The average number of operator-related
complaints received per month for both RTD and the private contractors for 2014 was 1,844. (Above
statistic is based on data through the 3rd quarter of 2014. Fourth quarter ridership and complaint
numbers were not available at the time of this report.)

REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
2014 ALLIED BARTON SECURITY SERVICES
AUDIT REPORT # 14-11-15

BACKGROUND SUMMARY
RTD entered into an agreement with Allied Barton to provide security services at
various RTD locations and special events, effective February 1, 2013. The initial
agreement covered a three year period for approximately $14.6 million. Several
amendments have added additional services and new locations which increased the
overall cost of the contract. Most recently, Amendment # 8 dated December 2014,
revised the Statement of Work and increased the contract to a new maximum of $16.1
million.
AUDIT SCOPE
Internal Audit’s review concentrated on the monthly process of invoice creation by Allied
Barton and the subsequent review, approval, and payment within RTD. The audit
universe included a total of 45 invoices from January 1, 2014 through early November
for a total of $5.2 million.
Internal Audit performed tests as considered necessary to ensure invoices supplied by
Allied Barton clearly indicate the hours charged by location and employee, and are
reviewed and approved by appropriate RTD management before payment is authorized.

CONCLUSION
The controls over invoice review and approval appeared adequate. RTD management
will request Allied Barton to include ‘totals’ for selected ‘hours’ calculations on their
invoice and supporting worksheets in an effort to make the review and approval process
more efficient within our organization.

CURRENT STATUS
Mutually agreed upon corrective action is underway and will be subject to our normal
Audit follow-up review.

REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
2014 CDW DISCOUNT COMPUTER WAREHOUSE
AUDIT REPORT # 14-11-11

BACKGROUND SUMMARY
RTD purchases computer hardware, software, user licenses, etc. from various sources,
including Computer Discount Warehouse (CDW). Generally, IT managers identify a
need for such equipment or software, and then request RTD Procurement to obtain
pricing quotes from reliable vendors.
The largest acquisition during the Scope period was for SharePoint user licenses which
allow RTD employees access to required software, at a cost of approximately $371,000.

AUDIT SCOPE
The Audit Scope included purchases from CDW between January 1, 2014 and midOctober. During this time, RTD spent approximately $622,000 on 18 purchases from
CDW.
Internal Audit performed tests as considered necessary to ensure the bidding and
evaluation process to choose CDW for selected purchases was properly executed and
documented in accordance with RTD procurement standards. The Audit Scope also
included a review to ensure that Software License purchases are properly justified and
internal tracking is adequate.
CONCLUSION
Internal Audit’s testing found that the process to select CDW for purchases was
adequately documented and payments were supported by Purchase Orders and
Invoices. IT Management will utilize Systems Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) in
2015 to improve the tracking of software licenses assigned to RTD employees and
contractors.
CURRENT STATUS
Mutually agreed upon corrective action is underway and will be subject to our normal
Audit follow-up review.

CONTRACT AND TEMPORARY EMPLOYEES
REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
AUDIT REPORT # 14-04-08

BACKGROUND SUMMARY
RTD has been using contract and temporary staff to augment the regular staff. In 2011 RTD
issued Contract #11DO018 Temporary Personnel Services with an internal annual estimate of
$361,065.00 and an award not-to-exceed amount of $50,000.00 per contract. The period of
performance indicated was from 9/1/2011 to 5/31/12 with two (2) additional one (1) year options.
The awards were issued to 15 Temporary Agencies. The total amounts paid were
$1,538,722 for 2012, $3,217,774 for 2013 and $2,095,042 for January to August 2014.
SCOPE
The scope of the audit included an assessment of RTD’s controls governing the use of contract
and temporary employees during the audit period.
OBJECTIVES
The objectives of the audit were to:






Determine the number of contract and temporary employees currently at RTD.
Analyze the use and cost of the contract and temporary employees.
Ensure these employees are classified correctly in the financial records.
Ensure appropriate procedures exist to control the use of contract and temporary staff
and they are being applied as prescribed.
Determine whether an adequate need exists for RTD to continue at the current level of
temporary staff.
CONCLUSION

RTD should not continue at this level of temporary employment.
RTD has not established adequate internal controls related to the use and control of temporary
personnel. As a result Internal Audit found instances that warrant rectification including:
 Lack of written policies and procedures.
 Temporary personnel providing services for prolonged periods.
 No verification of identity or eligibility of temporary personnel to work in the USA.
 Issues related to identification of budgeted funds.
 Lack of controls over authorization of timesheets and overtime.
Mutually agreed upon corrective action is underway and will be subject to our normal Audit
Follow-Up Review.

DATAMAN USA LLC CONTRACT
REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
AUDIT REPORT # 14-05-09

BACKGROUND SUMMARY
Dataman USA LLC describes itself as a leader in providing innovative complete temporary
professional services. The Information Technology (IT) Division uses Dataman USA LLC to
provide staffing through work order contracts under Contract #12DKO018A. RTD also uses
Dataman USA LLC to provide temporary staffing under Contract #11DO018-5, Temporary
Personnel Services.
The following amounts, calculated using Oracle reports, were paid to Dataman USA LLC under
both contracts between January 2012 and July 2014.

SCOPE

Based on the work performed during the preliminary survey and the assessment of risk, the
audit period will cover the operations of Dataman USA LLC from 2011 to 2014 however, there
may be references made to earlier periods as required.
OBJECTIVES
The objectives of the audit were to:
 Determine the need for RTD to continue at the current level of temporary personnel.
 Determine whether appropriate procedures exist to control the use of temporary/contract
staff and that they are being applied as prescribed.
 Ensure that temporary/contract employees’ costs are accurately recorded in the financial
system.
CONCLUSION
It is not in the best interest of RTD to continue at the current level of temporary staffing. In light
of the recent changes introduced by the Affordable Care ACT and the IRS regulations that have
played a part in several court cases ruling against government organizations, RTD must ensure
compliance with all relevant legislation.
Internal Audit has identified significant findings and made recommendations to comply with the
required legislation.
Mutually agreed upon corrective action is underway and will be subject to our normal Audit
Follow-Up Review.

REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
2014 DENVER TRANSIT PARTNERS – DIA
CONTINUOUS MONITORING – INTERIM # 1
AUDIT REPORT # 14-12-14
BACKGROUND SUMMARY
RTD investigated the option of building two major rail lines using a public-private
partnership, in early 2007. Significant effort was involved in developing and soliciting a
‘Request for Quotations’ (RFQ) and evaluating the results pertaining to a Design, Build,
Finance, Operate and Maintain Agreement for the East Rail Line to Denver International
Airport.
Denver Transit Partners (DTP) was awarded the contract with the lowest cost at
approximately $1.3 billion for the construction phase, and the best overall technical
score. Groundbreaking was initiated in August 2010 with significant progress since
then. The line is expected to open in 2016.
DTP submits a monthly invoice with documents to support ‘percentage of completion’
calculations and related charges to RTD. These are reviewed and approved by various
RTD individuals before payment is made to DTP.
AUDIT SCOPE
Internal Audit performed a limited review of the controls within RTD over DTP invoice
receipt, review, and approval to ensure that construction work billed for has been
properly completed. We also participated in a bus tour to observe actual construction
progress as of mid-December.
Testing was performed, including a detailed sample walkthrough, to validate that
monthly progress invoices are properly supported by detailed worksheets which identify
the tasks completed. We also ensured that there is evidence of RTD management
review and approval of the entire invoice package, including supporting progress
worksheets.
CONCLUSION
Based on the results of our limited testing, it appears that monthly progress invoices are
adequately supported by DTP and sufficiently reviewed by appropriate RTD employees
before payment is authorized. Internal Audit will continue our involvement with this
project as it proceeds in 2015.

IGA AND CAM AGREEMENTS
REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
AUDIT REPORT # 14-12-16

BACKGROUND SUMMARY
RTD has entered into agreements with various Inter-Governmental Agencies (IGA’s) to
share the costs of maintaining the common areas at various light rail and bus stations,
and park-n-Ride locations. Other non-governmental agreements provide an annual
budget for anticipated Common Area Maintenance (CAM) costs, which allocate a
calculated percentage to RTD and other involved parties.
RTD had the following IGAs and CAMS at the time of this audit and these were the
subject of the review - Arista Metropolitan District, Carr America/Dry Creek, US 85 and
Bridge Street PnR, AHEC- Auraria East and West, Stonegate – Lincoln and Jordan
PnR, Hampden Town Center – Dayton Station, Lincoln Station and Englewood
Environmental Foundation – Englewood Station.
SCOPE
The scope included examination and evaluation of the adequacy and effectiveness of
RTD’s system of internal controls and the reporting upon such controls and other
procedures pertaining to RTD’s IGAs and CAMs.

OBJECTIVES
The objectives of the audit were to:




Review procedures for cost determination and ensure compliance with them.
Ensure costs are appropriate.
Analysis of agreements to ensure monitoring is adequate.

CONCLUSION

The differences in the agreements make it difficult for actual comparison one to another;
however individual agreements were compared annually. In our opinion the IGAs and
CAMS are being adequately monitored.
This audit is considered closed.

KIEWIT INFRASTRUCTURE CO.
I-225 CONTINUOUS MONITORING
INTERIM REPORT 1
AUDIT REPORT # 14-06-13

BACKGROUND SUMMARY
RTD entered into Contract #12DH015 with Kiewit Infrastructure Co. for the design and
construction of the I-225 Rail Line project. The contract was signed on August 28, 2012. The
total Contract value was $350,000,000 including the design portion, the Right-of-Way
management portion and the construction part. Construction began in 2012.
SCOPE
This audit will involve continuous monitoring of the contract as it goes toward completion. This
section of the audit focused on the contract.
OBJECTIVES
This audit was selected by Internal Audit. The objectives of the audit will be to:
 Ensure compliance by RTD and the contractor.
 Ensure RTD Management has policies and procedures in place for physical verification
of construction and they are being applied as prescribed.
 Review Management oversight and legal involvement.
PROJECT STATUS
The I-225 Rail Line project team and the Design-Build team (Kiewit and AECOM) continue to
make progress on the Project. AECOM is approximately 97% complete with the design and
Kiewit has completed approximately 30% of the construction.
AECOM continues to coordinate with the City of Aurora (COA) for agency reviews of RFC
packages, site plan submittals, and have facilitated comment resolution meetings. Kiewit has full
access to in Segment 1 and have continued track construction north of the median bridge by
placing the initial ballast, concrete ties, attaching the rail, and placing the second lift of ballast.
Kiewit is also working on seven out of the eight bridge structures along the alignment including
the elevated station at Colfax Avenue.
The station platforms are being constructed at Iliff Station and Florida Station with foundation
and pier construction beginning on the west side of I-225 for the pedestrian bridge at the Florida
Station. During the month, Kiewit began drilling foundations for the LRT Bridge over Peoria
Street and constructed several walls for the LRT corridor along the Fitzsimons alignment.
Internal Audit will continue our involvement with the project in 2015.

PURCHASING CARD (PCARD) AUDIT
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT) DIVISION
REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
AUDIT REPORT # 14-01-17

BACKGROUND SUMMARY
Purchasing Cards are intended to be an easy to use, more efficient and cost-effective way to
buy and pay for lower value purchases. RTD participates in the State of Colorado Master
Contract for Credit Card Services via Citibank. At the current time, there are 10 Citibank
‘Corporate Cards’ assigned to IT employees. Approval limits for purchases generally do not
exceed a $3,000 per individual transaction. The current PCard arrangement generates a semiannual rebate to RTD of approximately 1.7% of purchases. Year-to-date through November, the
IT employees spent $525,228.
SCOPE
The scope included review of the transactions from January to November 2014.
All employee PCard statements were included in the review and testing of supporting
documentation and compliance with RTD policies and procedures.
OBJECTIVES
The objectives of the audit were to ensure:
1. Adherence to Purchasing card policies and procedures and
2. Purchasing cards are used for valid business purposes only.
METHODOLOGY
The methodology used to accomplish the objectives of the audit included but were not limited to
the following:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

Reviewed the policies and procedures for RTDs Purchasing cards
Obtained information on all card holders and reviewed related forms.
Obtained lists of all transactions for the period indicated under the scope.
Reviewed all transactions and related documentation to confirm the business purpose.
Interviewed staff to provide further information where needed.
CONCLUSION

There was compliance with the purchasing card policies and procedures. All purchases
reviewed were for RTDs business purposes. One purchasing card was not used within the audit
scope; a review should be conducted to determine if the card should be terminated.

REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
SMART MEDIA TECHNOLOGY PROJECT
SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE REVIEW
2014 INTERIM AUDIT REPORT # 14-11-10

BACKGROUND SUMMARY
RTD has elected to implement the Smart Media Technology (SMT) system on its buses, and
train platforms using a ‘phased in’ approach. ACS (Affiliated Computer Services) a subsidiary of
Xerox has been working with RTD since 2011 to implement all aspects of this project. The RTD
Board recently approved a contract increase which raises the project cost to $19.7 million,
including equipment for the new RTD Light Rail platforms.
Since 2013, efforts have concentrated on developing a system that will allow passengers to
purchase credit as ‘stored value’ on their Smart Card, which will then be reduced when the card
holder ‘taps on’ to ride an RTD bus or Light Rail (LRT) vehicle. Security Officers will be utilized
to periodically test LRT riders’ cards to verify that they have ‘tapped on’ and have not exceeded
their ‘paid-for’ trip length. Stored Value capability was planned for mid-2014, but has been
delayed and is currently expected to be implemented in August 2015.
One of the stated project benefits is to eventually collect ridership data from passenger use of
electronic media cards for both bus and LRT rides. Such data will be analyzed by RTD and
used in future pricing analyses.
AUDIT SCOPE
Utilizing a System Development Life Cycle approach, our participation in 2014 has continued to
include a review of the development procedures being used to build a system that will satisfy
the needs of the District. Internal Audit has also monitored activities to ensure new capabilities
are adequately tested in advance of moving into a live, full production environment.
CONCLUSION
During 2014, the RTD Project Team has consistently worked with Xerox to develop the
electronic fare media system that was originally anticipated. However, as noted above,
problems and setbacks have been experienced and the goal to ‘go live’ with Stored Value
capability has now been postponed until the third quarter of 2015.
Due to ongoing issues, the development and use of Hand Held Security Devices has not met
original expectations. This has resulted in a limited ability to ensure that ECO and College Pass
riders have ‘tapped on’ before boarding RTD Light Rail vehicles. Audit has suggested that
efforts be initiated to utilize these devices as originally planned and full use of these devices is
now expected during the first quarter of 2015.

CURRENT STATUS
Mutually agreed upon corrective action is underway and will be subject to our normal Audit
follow-up review as Internal Audit continues to be involved with the Project Team.

VEOLIA TRANSPORTATION SERVICES FUEL AUDIT
REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
AUDIT REPORT #14-12-19

BACKGROUND SUMMARY
This audit was included as part of our Annual Audit Plan for 2014. In May 2009 Regional
Transportation District (RTD) entered into Contract #19DH010 with Veolia Transportation
Services Inc. (Veolia). The contract was for an initial three years with two further option years.
The initial 3 years - $79,689,258.00 (including Est. $12,264,770.00 Fuel). Option Year 1 $28,309,762.00 (including $4,323,822.00 Fuel), and option year 2 - $29,240,654.00 (including
4,459,836.00 Fuel). The fuel costs were to be reimbursed by RTD. Option year one
commenced on January 10, 2013 and expired on January 9, 2014 and option year 2
commenced on January 10, 2014 and will end on January 9, 2015.
Veolia has delivery times on Monday to Friday from 7:00am to 5:00pm. Veolia has two above,
ground diesel fuel tanks each with a capacity of 10,000 gallons. Their monthly/annual purchases
are 92,000 gallons per month or 1.1million gallons each year.
SCOPE
The audit concentrated on those areas of the contracts which were signed and define fuel costs
as they relate to Veolia during 2014. It covered the internal controls surrounding the accounting
for this contract as invoices for fuel are submitted and paid on a regular basis
OBJECTIVES
This audit was selected by Internal Audit. The objectives included:




Confirming that Veolia was only being reimbursed for fuel purchased and used for RTD
purposes.
Ensuring that payments were properly authorized and approved
Ensuring that all invoice charges were valid, reasonable and accurate and according to
contract terms and conditions.
CONCLUSION

The process for approving and authorizing payments for fuel are very rigorous, ensuring that the
entire process is in agreement with the contract terms and conditions. Review of a sample of
paid invoices supported the above statement.
At the current time Internal Audit identified no significant issues. We would like to thank all those
who assisted with this review.

RTD’s Cybersecurity Framework
(1) Does the organization use a security framework?

Answer: Yes. RTD’s cybersecurity assessments and strategy are
informed by multiple government and private industry standards
and frameworks.
•

Standards used for benchmarking RTD’s cybersecurity posture in 2014:
• NIST Cybersecurity Framework (pub. 12 Feb 2014); correlates to:
• NIST SP 800-53
• COBIT
• ISO 27001
• SANS Critical Security Controls for Effective Cyber Defense

•

Standards that additionally inform the growth and development of RTD’s
cybersecurity strategy:
• APTA Standards Development Program Recommended Practices
• FTA Threat and Vulnerability Assessment Methodologies
• Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Recommendations and
Methodologies, including those put forth by the Center for Internet
Security (CIS) and sponsored by the DHS

Top Five Cybersecurity Risks
(2) What are the top five risks the organization has related to cybersecurity?

Answer: The top five things that keep me up at night are:
1) Securing RTD’s credit card Point of Sale systems
2) Maintaining the integrity and availability of RTD’s customer communications systems
3) Reviewing and applying appropriate access control to RTD’s sensitive data, including personnel,
payroll, and accounting systems
4) Managing third party and Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) access to RTD systems and networks
5) Controlling visibility and access to control and dispatch systems

Employee Cybersecurity Awareness
(3) How are employees made aware of their role related to cybersecurity?

Answer: RTD’s security policy, Management Directive IT-1: Secure Computing Standards,
and an accompanying cybersecurity training program and wiki, Cybersecurity@RTD,
were published in May 2014, piloted with employees throughout 2014, and became an
annual requirement for all salaried employees in January 2015.
•

In 2014, 226 employees took the
Cybersecurity@RTD self-guided training
from the RTD intranet site

•

Training was introduced to all new
employees joining RTD since June of
2014

•

Training and policy are revised and
evaluated annually as the cybersecurity
program matures

Cybersecurity Threat Analysis
(4) Are external and internal threats considered when planning cybersecurity program activities?

Answer: Yes. RTD’s receives information about threats originating from inside and
outside the organization from a variety of external sources. RTD follows FTA
methodologies to identify our most critical assets and prioritize cybersecurity actions to
have the most impact on the greatest areas of risk.
•

Government and private sector information sharing
groups for transportation, cybersecurity, and critical
infrastructure threat intelligence

•

Focus on the “unintentional insider” with
cybersecurity governance, awareness training, and

Security Governance
(5) How is security governance managed within the organization?

Answer: Cybersecurity responsibility is delegated to the Information Technology
department. Major risks are reviewed with the Senior Manager of IT and IT
Management as they are identified; critical risks and incidents are reviewed with the IT
Governance Committee (AGMs) and Senior Leadership Team (AGMs and GM).

Incident Response
(6) In the event of a serious breach, has management developed a robust response protocol?

Answer: Yes. In early 2014, RTD developed a preliminary critical incident handling
framework for IT that addresses data breach or loss, security incidents, and major
outages. Using industry best practices and lessons learned in 2014, RTD formally
defined and published a robust incident management process in December 2014.
•

Three-phased response process:
• Declare an incident
• Execute the response plan
• Incident review

•

Identifies roles and responsibilities and communication flows from identification to closure

Fourth Quarter 2014 Investment Report

INFORMATION
Please find the District’s investment report for the fourth quarter of 2014 attached.
The U.S. economy expanded at a rate of 2.4% percent during the fourth quarter of 2014. The national
unemployment rate declined to 5.6% and general inflationary pressures remain tame.
In order to promote economic recovery, the Federal Reserve has continued with its accommodative
monetary policy and left the federal funds target rate range (0.0% - 0.25%). The committee noted that
in determining how long to maintain this target range, it will “assess progress-both realized and
expected-toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation”. The Federal Reserve
finished winding down its $85 billion a month bond purchase program in October, 2014.
The District’s Investment Policy (the “Policy”) is conservative in nature and seeks to satisfy the three
primary objectives of: safety, liquidity and yield, in that order of importance.
The Policy specifies that:
“Quarterly reports shall outline the District’s total investment return and compare the portfolio’s
performance to a publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics
to the portfolio or sub-portfolio being measured. For the liquidity tier of the portfolio (cash and cash
equivalents), the specified index shall be the 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index as published by Bank of
America Merrill Lynch for the period being measured. For the enhanced cash portion of the portfolio
(securities maturing between 90 days and 5 years and with a target duration of 1 year), the designated
performance benchmark will be the Merrill Lynch 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.”
The total return on the liquidity and enhanced cash tiers of the District’s unrestricted portfolio and
investment benchmarks were as follows:
Liquidity Tier:

4th Quarter

Y-T-D

RTD cash and cash equivalents:

Enhanced Cash Tier:
RTD enhanced cash:
B of A/Merrill Lynch 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index:

The yield of the District’s unrestricted portfolio through the fourth quarter of 2014 was 0.20% which
would produce annualized earnings of $366,961. The current return for the month of December was
0.22%.
