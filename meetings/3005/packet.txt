BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Paul J. Ballard, Interim General Manager and
CEO

Date: May 27, 2020

From:

William C. Van Meter,
Manager, Planning

GM

Date:

May 26, 2020

Subject:

RTD Boundary Certification & Director District
Designation

Assistant

General

Board Meeting Date: June 2, 2020

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the Board Secretary to certify the boundary map and description to reflect three new
annexations in the Town of Erie. It is further recommended that all three of these newly annexed parcels
be assigned to District I (Director Lubow).
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals for 2020:
Core Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management
BACKGROUND
HB 1295-07 requires that the District revise its boundary map and legal description following any
changes to the District’s boundary. Further, pursuant to CRS 32-9-106.6 (b), any area annexed by an inDistrict municipality on or after May 25, 1994, is automatically included in the District. In this particular
case, the Town of Erie has annexed three parcels into the Town. Since parts of the Town are in the
District, any annexations by the Town automatically become included in RTD. The Board is not being
asked to approve the annexations, but to authorize the Board Secretary to certify the boundary map and
description to reflect the new annexations, and to assign the newly annexed areas to a specific Director
District.
The Town of Erie annexations are as follows.
Annexation
I-25 North Parcel
I-25 South Parcel
Swink

Acreage
99.83
155.29
150.29

Adjacent Director District
I
I
I

The land involved in all three annexations encompasses approximately 405 acres or approximately 0.63
square miles. All of the properties are undeveloped or farmland. All three parcels are adjacent to Director
District I (Director Lubow).
FINANCIAL IMPACT
No financial impact is associated with this action. It should be noted, however, that as these properties
develop, depending on the mix of uses, they will generate sales tax revenue for the District.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Paul J. Ballard, Interim General Manager and
CEO

Date: May 27, 2020

From:

William C. Van Meter,
Manager, Planning

GM

Date:

May 26, 2020

Subject:

Parking Structure Management Agreement at
Olde Town Arvada Station

Assistant

General

Board Meeting Date: June 2, 2020

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to negotiate and execute an
Intergovernmental Agreement (the “IGA”) with the City of Arvada (the “City” or “Arvada”) to govern
parking management at the Olde Town Transit Hub (the “Hub”), the parking garage at Olde Town
Arvada Station (the “Station”).
This action addresses the following General Manager’s goals for 2020:
• Task Goal #3: Enhance Current and Future Transportation Methods
• Task Goal #5: Increase Ridership
BACKGROUND
This topic was mostly recently discussed with the Board at the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks
Committee meeting on April 7, 2020.
In 2007, in anticipation of the construction of the G Line, the City of Arvada released the Arvada Transit
Station Framework Plan, highlighting Olde Town Arvada Station as the most prominent station along the
G Line. The plan foresaw the “character of the Olde Town Station area [as] a vibrant urban village that
preserves its historic fabric and also allows new opportunities for living, employment, shopping, dining,
and cultural experiences.” In order to move that vision forward, the City of Arvada and the Arvada
Urban Renewal Authority (AURA) sought RTD’s support in aligning RTD’s G Line corridor planning with
local goals. Specifically, Arvada suggested that, rather than expand the existing RTD surface parking lot,
RTD work with the City and private partners to accommodate bus and rail parking in a garage; this
strategy would open up land for development adjacent to the Station.
In 2014, RTD, the City, and AURA released a Request for Proposals for the development of a 9-acre site
southeast of the Station, which included an existing RTD Park-n-Ride. The group’s intent was for the
privately developed project to include a mix of uses that would complement and enhance the existing
character of Olde Town. Trammell Crow was selected as the developer, and planning and design began
on what has become the Olde Town Transit Hub. The Hub is owned by Arvada and includes an RTD bus
transit facility on the ground floor and 600 parking spaces on the floors above. The Hub was funded by
Arvada/AURA, RTD, and a CDOT Faster Grant. Arvada contributed more than $24 million, the Faster
Grant totaled $1.5 million, and RTD allocated the $7 million it would have spent on a new surface lot, as
well as $3.4 million in land value. RTD’s contribution included FTA funds from the New Starts grant for
the Eagle project and federal funds that were used in the original purchase of the surface parking lot.

Packet Pg. 8

1.B.2

The Hub opened in fall 2016 and began serving RTD rail patrons in the spring of 2019 with the opening
of the G Line. Bus operations moved into the ground-floor facility in August 2019.
When the Hub opened to RTD patrons, Arvada granted RTD a Permanent and Nonexclusive Easement to
the bus facility and 400 spaces in the garage; the remaining 200 spaces are reserved for Olde Town
employees and visitors. The parties also agreed to an Operation and Maintenance Intergovernmental
Agreement, which makes Arvada responsible for the upkeep of the garage, with an annual $44,000
payment from RTD to Arvada to cover some of the costs. In 2019, the cost to manage and maintain the
Hub was approximately $415,000. Lastly, Arvada and RTD committed to a Memorandum of
Understanding (the “MOU”) that established an 18-month, Preliminary Parking Management Plan to
regulate parking in the Hub. Under the MOU, the Hub’s parking spaces are segregated pursuant to the
easement and Arvada is not permitted to charge parking fees. Arvada and RTD agreed to use the 18
months of the MOU to gather and analyze parking data and develop a permanent parking plan that
would be formalized in the IGA that is now under consideration.
Arvada contracted with Walker Consultants to complete a parking study in the Hub and recommend
parking-management strategies based on industry best practices. Based on data collected by manual
counts in the Hub, Walker determined that the average peak utilization on weekdays from August to
December 2019 was approximately 63%. RTD’s spaces were far more highly utilized on weekdays than
Arvada’s, 85% and 17% respectively. On weekends, overall utilization was lower, at only 20%, or 23%
of RTD’s spaces and 13% of Arvada’s. Walker cross-checked the manual data with users’ selfidentification via a cellphone app and kiosks, as well as with bus and rail ridership. The consultants
determined that, although it was not possible to verify that all the users parking in RTD spaces were in
fact using RTD, users were generally following the Hub’s rules and generating accurate data.
Given that weekday peak utilization stood at approximately 63% at the end of 2019 and was dominated
by RTD patrons, Arvada and RTD, with input from Walker Consultants, have tentatively agreed that if
utilization reaches 85% Arvada has the right to charge all users parking fees in order to manage parking
demand. In other words, Arvada will use parking charges to ensure that there are always some open
spaces in the garage. In exchange, parking will no longer be segregated under the easement, giving RTD
patrons access to more parking spaces within the garage. However, the easement will remain in place to
protect the interests of RTD and the FTA in the Hub.
COVID-19 has caused precipitous declines in utilization at the Hub as ridership has dropped and Olde
Town businesses have temporarily closed. At the beginning of 2020, it seemed possible that utilization
at the garage would reach 85% and Arvada would be able to start charging soon; now, it seems more
likely that it will be years before the combined use generated by RTD ridership and Olde Town
employees and businesses will hit the 85% milestone.
DISCUSSION
This action would give the General Manager and/or his designee the authority to negotiate and
execute the IGA with Arvada to govern parking management at the Hub. RTD’s execution of the IGA
will only be authorized to take place if the following conditions are met:
1. There will be no segregation of parking spaces in the Hub between the 400 spaces for which
RTD holds an easement and Arvada’s 200 spaces. As such, RTD customers will have
unimpeded access to all 600 spaces, including at peak times.
2. Arvada will use all revenue generated at the Hub for the management and maintenance of the
Hub or, alternatively, transit-supportive uses approved by RTD.

Packet Pg. 9

1.B.2

3. All customers will be required to self-identify as RTD or Arvada users by cellphone app or at a
kiosk in the Hub.
4. Arvada will report utilization rates and customers’ self-identified user type to RTD on a
monthly basis. Additionally, RTD may perform its own audits and will have access to Arvada’s
records related to the Hub.
5. Arvada will be permitted to charge all users to park in the Hub if the average weekday peak
utilization rate reaches or exceeds 85%. Arvada will be permitted to charge each vehicle up to
$2/day for the stabilization period.
6. At the end of the stabilization period, and at regular intervals thereafter, Arvada will analyze
utilization rates and notify RTD if Arvada intends to raise or lower the parking rate:
a. If the average weekday peak utilization rate reaches or exceeds 85%, Arvada may raise
the fee in 50-cent increments to manage parking demand.
b. If the average weekday peak utilization rate falls below 55%, Arvada will decrease the
fee in 50-cent increments to promote utilization.
7. The maximum daily fee allowed under this IGA will be $5.
8. For special events after 5pm on weekdays, or on weekends and holidays, Arvada may
designate special rates in order to manage parking availability. RTD users will be exempt from
special rates.
9. Overnight, multi-day parking up to 30 days will be allowed.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Accepting the Recommended Action would have no impact on RTD’s ongoing operations and
maintenance costs for the Hub, which are governed by a separate agreement.

RTD's Fixing America’s Surface Transportation
(FAST) Act Reauthorization Priorities

Assistant

General

Board Meeting Date: June 2, 2020
Information

Fixing America’s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act expires on September 30, 2020. The FAST Act
reflects the ongoing federal commitment and investment in the nation’s surface transportation system.
Ongoing and sustainable investment in high capacity transit is clearly tied to the ability of metropolitan
areas to attract employers and retain workers.
RTD has been an active participant in the array of formula and grant programs enabled through the FAST
Act. These programs, however, require a combination of local and federal funding for implementation
and success. Recently, RTD’s local funding has been severely impacted by COVID-19 and the resulting
economic shutdown. The damage to these revenue sources is unprecedented and unanticipated. The
impact is deep and will ripple well into the future. It will take many months, if not years, for the
economy to rebound as social distancing is gradually relaxed throughout the United States.
RTD has identified several top FAST Act reauthorization priorities, which are listed immediately below
and detailed in the recent letter to our congressional delegation (attached). These are:
•
•
•

Return the Credit Risk Premium on RTD’s Repaid RRIF Loan
Greater Bus Formula Funding to Maximize Benefits of Asset Management
Robust Funding for Small Starts Projects

In addition to these top priorities, RTD also endorses and supports national FAST Act reauthorization
priorities which are explained here. While RTD may not be able to take advantage of all the programs
inherent in these priorities in the short term, we may be positioned to do so during the forthcoming
reauthorization period.
Adjust the federal/local share of Capital Investment Grant (CIG) program projects. The CIG percentage
share of the total capital cost of projects has declined over the past two decades as federal funding has
not kept pace with the demand of citizens and businesses in metropolitan areas to invest in transit. This
demand combined with insufficient federal funding has led to the rationing of federal funding to allow
more projects to be built and has significantly increased the financial burden on states and local areas.
The CIG program can be part of an economic stimulus program. In light of the devastating impact on
State and local revenue sources and the permanent loss of cumulative State and local revenues, we call
on FTA to increase the CIG percentage contribution to 60 percent for New Starts and Core Capacity and
Small Starts projects to 80 percent consistent with 49 U.S.C. §5309(l). Raising the federal share will
both level the playing field between highway and transit investments as regions seek to expand capacity
in a project corridor and also mitigate a likely delay in building projects due to the permanent loss of
revenues as the economy seeks to recover from the economic shutdown.

Packet Pg. 29

1.D.1

Amend the list of eligible expenses under 49 U.S.C. 4903 to include equity dividends in the case of P3
projects. P3 projects have some costs and revenues that are fundamentally different from those of
traditionally delivered projects. FTA’s list of eligible expenses does not include some of the project costs
associated with P3s, therefore limiting the extent to which an agency can utilize its New Starts funding
to fund P3s. This is particularly the case with respect to equity dividends, which are not currently
considered an eligible expense.
Small Starts Eligibility. Congress established the thresholds for Small Starts at total cost of less than
$300 million and a CIG share of less than $100 million in the FAST Act in 2015. Since establishing
these thresholds, there have been significant increases in the cost of construction. Moreover, by setting
the thresholds at these levels, Congress is requiring overmatch exceeding 50 percent for projects that
currently exceed $200 million in project cost. RTD supports increasing the federal share to $200 million;
and, increasing the total cost of projects to $400 million. This change could be beneficial to Bus Rapid
Transit projects in the region such as Colfax BRT and State Highway 119 BRT if they were to achieve
eligibility for federal funding.
Core Capacity Funding Eligibility. Expand the list of considerations to include the extent to which a
project will overcome physical or other barriers to service increases, such as system bottlenecks, or train
control limitations that must be addressed on system-wide basis, not solely on a corridor basis. RTD
could potentially benefit from this program, particularly for long-term capacity constraints anticipated
between I-25/Broadway and downtown Denver.
Enhance Technological Development. The transit industry is in the midst of substantial technological
change. The FAST Act promoted technological change by promoting innovation in section 5312, by
creating the No and Low Emission Bus Program in section 5339(c) and section 5319(c)(3) which allows
a zero-emission power source to be leased and treated apart from the useful life of a rolling stock. This
change in the useful life of the zero-emission source of power was due to concern that manufacturers
could not yet warrant that the power source would last 12 years for a bus or 25 years for a rail car.
Congress should grant FTA broad authority to waive procurement requirements that constrain the
introduction of innovative technology. RTD is now subject to ambitious state-wide fleet electrification
targets.
Value Capture. The Administration promotes “value capture” for transit projects which RTD supports.
This takes many different forms, including tax increment financing (“TIF”), creation of benefit
assessment districts, developers building transit stations or joint development.
Joint development is overseen by the FTA where federal funds have been used for the acquisition of
property that is later used for “associated transit improvements” that enhances the use of transit or is
physically or functionally related to transit. Many transit agencies have utilized the joint development
authority but usually after a transit capital project is completed. The benefit of this authority is that the
revenues generated can be used for both capital and operating purposes by a transit agency.
To enhance value capture we request that CIG projects that can document a revenue stream or capital
funding from “value capture” be able to improve the rating of their Financial Plan by a half step which
would allow, for example, a “Medium-Low” rating be raised to a “Medium” overall rating. RTD also
requests the use of station area “value capture” be added to the suite of tools available to increase land
use and the economic development measures ratings as it can both raise revenue and motivate truly
transit-supportive development. As RTD pursues an array of options to complete the FasTracks program,
value capture could be one piece of the financing puzzle.

The Honorable Ed Perlmutter
U.S. House of Representatives
Dear Senators Gardner and Bennet, and Representatives DeGette, Neguse, Buck, Crow,
and Perlmutter:
Should Congress craft a surface transportation infrastructure package in your work to help
spur our economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, RTD seeks your strong
support and advocacy for our priorities in that legislation.
First, please know we are grateful for your successful efforts to secure $25 billion in the
CARES Act to address the direct impacts on RTD and transit agencies nationwide from
social distancing and work-from-home mandates to combat the pandemic. By our latest
figures, RTD struggles under fare box revenue losses from a 66 percent drop in ridership
and suspension of fare collection due to rear-door boarding to limit contact with operators.
Additionally, we face looming declines in dedicated sales/use tax revenues as many
businesses remain shuttered. Together, farebox and sales/use tax revenues comprise 71
percent of our budget. For the three month period of March - May, RTD anticipates fare
box revenue losses of $30 million.
While the pandemic's impacts to our public transportation systems are unprecedented, we
continue to operate core routes to serve those who, like our bus and rail operators, are
essential to keeping our communities functioning. And we know from past economic
downturns that our transportation and infrastructure networks remain essential to virtually
all aspects of daily life and thus can serve as catalysts for economic recovery. Accordingly,
in advancing the following requests, Congress can help ensure RTD has the resources
needed to invest in cost-effective, sustainable public transportation service for the entire
Denver region, now and in the years ahead.
Return the Credit Risk Premium on RTD's Repaid RRIF Loan: We seek the return of our
$28.9 million credit risk premium (CRP) on our long-repaid RRIF loan for the Denver Union

Station redevelopment project. We appreciate the support of the entire delegation for this effort, including the
recent introduction of H.R. 6452. Both H.R. 6452 and the Senate companion bill introduced last July, S. 2213,
direct US DOT to promptly return the CRPs of all repaid RRIF loans in our cohort (cohort 3 (2009 - 2015))
upon repayment of each individual loan. Under both bills, RTD and Denver would promptly receive the $28.9
million (plus interest) we paid US DOT in 2010 on the DUS loan. Without this fix, our repaid loan - and our
$28.9 million - remain tethered to a group of other, still-active cohort 3 loans for decades to come, as several
of these loans have 35-year repayment periods.
Greater Bus Formula Funding to Maximize Benefits of Asset Management: Under our asset management plan,
RTD has been able to strategically and systematically procure, operate, maintain, and replace transit assets to
manage performance and costs over asset lifecycles. Key to realizing the full potential of asset management is
reliable funding streams available to make appropriate investments where and when condition and
performance data direct us. To date, the potential gains from RTD's asset management program have been
constrained by the lack of such reliable funding sources. Accordingly, RTD requests that Congress authorize
increased funding for the Buses and Bus Facilities formula program under 49 U.S.C. 5339(a). By prioritizing
funding best suited to serve data-driven repair and maintenance decisions, Congress can help RTD and transit
agencies nationwide make meaningful progress in bringing our transit systems into a state of good repair.
Accordingly, we seek sufficient additional funding to meet the pressing state-of-good-repair needs transit
agencies across the US face, particularly for aging maintenance facilities.
Robust Funding for Small Starts Projects: With a long pipeline of planned BRT projects, RTD seeks increased
funding for the Small Starts component of the Capital Investment Grant program at 49 U.S.C. 5309. The Small
Starts program should receive sufficient additional funding to ensure that all projects meeting FTA's project
justification and financial commitment criteria can receive Federal funds before their project costs increase.
Additionally, we support the proposal of the American Public Transportation Association to increase the
maximum Federal share of each Small Start project from $100 million to $200 million and to increase the total
estimated net capital costs cap from $300 million to $400 million.
We are eager to work with you to realize these important improvements in transit funding and finance
programs. With your help, we can better serve our riders, weather the impacts of coronavirus, and make
meaningful, long-term investments in infrastructure that move our economy forward.

Ridership – Preliminary Baseline Results
§ Preliminary modeling has been completed for six baseline

scenarios, five passenger rail scenarios and a best bus scenario
o Results are favorable and have room for improvement
o Ridership is expected to increase under all Rail Scenarios
o Ridership may increase under Best Bus scenario also but not as much

room for improvement
§ Refinements will improve ridership
o Engineering improvements to changes in horizontal and vertical geometry

to increase speeds and travel times
o Refinements to operating characteristics, such as improved connections
or station locations
o Mix and match best performing segments with hybrid
corridors/alternatives
§ Rail is projected to have higher ridership than bus
§ Rail ridership projections (even these conservative early forecasts)

compare favorably to existing passenger rail services around the
United States".

Re:

Session Update

The 2020 Legislative Session of the Colorado General Assembly will re-convene today, Tuesday
May 26 at 9:00 am in the House and 10:00am in the Senate. Prior to adjournment on March 14
there were approximately 355 bills to be acted upon and approximately 51 days left in the
legislative session.
Leadership in both houses have signaled their desire to have a condensed session given the
pandemic as well as the state’s current budget crisis. We believe there is an agreed upon list of
current bills that are likely to pass during this limited session - if and when we see this list we
will forward.
We have attached the schedule for the House and Senate proceedings. All committees of
reference will meet during the first week of session. During the remaining weeks only three
committees will be meeting: State Veterans and Military Affairs, Finance and Appropriations.
Initially the committee members will remain the same but throughout the remaining days that
makeup could change, and any changes to committees will be announced by leadership of the
majority and minority parties. Although staff investigated ways to offer the opportunity for
remote testimony, it was not feasible. Those wishing to provide comments to committees on
legislation under consideration will be asked to do so in writing.
During the break, BBMK participated in numerous calls with legislative leadership regarding the
upcoming schedule as well as information regarding potential new legislation.
To date we are aware of legislation being drafted to address the following topics: (attached are
the drafts we have to date)
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Worker’s Compensation proposal to change the burden of proof and presumption
standard for workers to request benefits for COVID related health impacts.
Whistleblower protections (public and private entities currently included) for employees
reporting working conditions that put workers at risk of contracting the COVID-19 virus.
Reinsurance proposal that would shift the state’s share of the costs of the program to the
health insurance industry
Extending Executive Order regarding liquor delivery
Price Gouging legislation that would only take effect upon a declaration of emergency by
the President or the Governor and apply only to essential goods and services coming from
the Attorney General’s office
Extending Executive Order regarding telehealth
Liability relief for employers

SB20-151 was Postponed Indefinitely today by the sponsor in the Senate Judiciary Committee.
The Chairs of the Transportation committees asked to talk over this past weekend about a
proposed late bill creating an oversight committee of RTD. BBMK, Director Guissinger, Board
Chair Rivera-Malpiede, Sherry Ellebracht, and interim GM Ballard met with Transportation
committee chairs to discuss their desire to create through a legislation a formal oversight
committee. After multiple calls it was agreed that RTD, the General Assembly and the
Administration will work to accomplish the goals of an oversight committee through an
agreement between the parties without legislation. The Transportation Chairs are working with
the Polis Administration to get buy in on our proposed committee and Directors Malpiede and
Guissinger are working with the Board and SLT to solicit input. Multiple conversations took
place over the three-day weekend and on Sunday morning consensus was reached by all parties
to continue to move forward without legislation this year. BBMK is sincerely appreciative of the
Board and staffs’ quick, creative and professional work during this past weekend’s negotiations.
After making decisions on over 350 items in a 2-week time span, the JBC has finalized a Long
Bill package to be sent to the whole General Assembly. The Long Bill package totals $11.9
billion in total General Fund appropriations, with $310 million in transfers to the General Fund
and 43 orbital bills. The $3.4 billion needed to balance the budget was found through a plethora
of transfers, expenditure cuts, and changes in policy affecting every department. Some of the
large changes are summarized in the bullet points below.
•

$577 million cut to K-12 education. This amount includes $147 million that would
otherwise be used for K-12 education grants transferred to pay for total programs costs.

•

58% cut, totaling about $500 million, to Higher Education. This cut does not include
other smaller cuts in the Department of Higher Education for certain scholarship
programs and State merit based financial aid.

•

$225 million cut resulting from the elimination of the PERA Direct Distribution payment.

•

$70 million cut resulting from a 5% personal services base reduction for State employees.

•

$161 million transferred from the HAS fee to the General Fund.

•

$30 million in FY 2020-21 and $24 million in FY2019-20 transferred to the General
Fund resulting from the enhanced federal match rate for Medicaid.

•

$24.9 million (1%) cut to community provider rates.

•

$196.4 million transferred from various cash funds.

•

$45.5 million transferred from the Severance Tax Perpetual Base Fund to the General
Fund. This transfer leaves $33 million in this fund to be used for water projects in FY
2020-21.

•

$43 million transferred from the Unclaimed Property Trust Fund to the General Fund.
This transfer was made possible by delaying the expected $30 million transfer to the
Housing Development Grant Fund from the Unclaimed Property Trust Fund for two
years.

•

$62 million cut to CDOT. This cut results from the elimination of a $50 million General
Fund obligation for CDOT’s debt service payments and an action to offset General Fund
obligations for FY 2018-19 and FY 2019-20 COP payments with $12 million State
Highway Fund dollars.

•

$32.1 million transferred from the State Employee Reserve Fund and the Technology
Advancement and Emergency Fund. The bill initiating this transfer also repeals both
funds.

•

$136.9 million from the Marijuana Tax Cash Fund to the General Fund. $100 million of
this transfer is made possible by the policy change of allowing MTCF dollars to be spent
in the year they are collected instead of in arrears.

BBMK will continue to provide timely updates as the session resumes and please do not hesitate

who is:
!
Experiencing flu-like or respiratory illness symptoms; and
!
Being tested for COVID-19 or under instructions to
quarantine or isolate due to a risk of having COVID-19.
The act uses money from the federal "Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and
Economic Security Act" to reimburse employers for the direct expense in
providing employees paid sick leave wages for leave taken related to
COVID-19.
Additionally, beginning January 1, 2021, the act requires all
employers in Colorado to provide paid sick leave to their employees,
accrued at one hour of sick leave for every 30 hours worked, subject to
the following limits:
!
For employers employing 50 or more employees, the
employer is not required to provide more than a total of 80
hours of paid sick leave in a 12-month period;
!
For employers employing 1 to 49 employees, the employer
is not required to provide more than a total of 40 hours of
paid sick leave in a 12-month period.
An employee:
!
Begins accruing paid sick leave when the employee's
employment begins; and
!
May use paid sick leave as it is accrued; and
!
May carry forward and use in subsequent calendar years
paid sick leave that is not used in the year in which it is
accrued, subject to applicable caps on the total amount of
leave allowed in a 12-month period.
Employees may use accrued paid sick leave to be absent from
work for the following purposes:
!
The employee has a mental or physical illness, injury, or
health condition; needs a medical diagnosis, care, or
treatment related to such illness, injury, or condition; or
needs to obtain preventive medical care;
!
The employee needs to care for a family member who has
a mental or physical illness, injury, or health condition;
needs a medical diagnosis, care, or treatment related to
such illness, injury, or condition; or needs to obtain
preventive medical care;
!
The employee or family member has been the victim of
domestic abuse, sexual assault, or harassment and needs to
be absent from work for purposes related to such crime; or

place of business due to a public health emergency, denotes changes from
prior draft
necessitating the employee's absence from work.
In addition to the paid sick leave accrued by an employee, the act
requires an employer to provide its employees an additional amount of
paid sick leave during a public health emergency in an amount based on
the number of hours the employee works.
The act prohibits an employer from retaliating against an employee
who uses the employee's paid sick leave or otherwise exercises the
employee's rights under the act. Employers are required to notify
employees of their rights under the act by providing employees with a
written notice of their rights and displaying a poster, developed by the
division of labor standards and statistics (division) in the department of
labor and employment, detailing employees' rights under the act.
Employers must retain records documenting, by employee, the
hours worked, paid sick leave accrued, and paid sick leave used and make
such records available to the division to monitor compliance with the act.
The director of the division will implement and enforce the act and
adopt rules necessary for such purposes. The act treats an employee's
information about the employee's or a family member's health condition
or domestic abuse, sexual assault, or harassment case as confidential and
prohibits an employer from disclosing such information or requiring the
employee to disclose such information as a condition of using paid sick
leave.
Employers, including public employers, that provide comparable
paid leave to their employees and allow employees to use that leave as
permitted under the act are not required to provide additional paid sick
leave to their employees.
Employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement would
not be entitled to sick leave under the act if the collective bargaining
agreement expressly waives the requirements of the act and provides an
equivalent benefit to covered employees.

(Note: This summary applies to this resolution as introduced and
does not reflect any amendments that may be subsequently adopted. If this
resolution passes third reading in the house of introduction, a resolution
summary that applies to the reengrossed version of this resolution will be
available at http://leg.colorado.gov/.)
Property tax in Colorado is generally equal to the actual value of
property multiplied by an assessment rate, and the resulting assessed
value is multiplied by each applicable local government's mill levy. The
assessment rate for residential real property is established by the general
assembly in accordance with a provision of the state constitution that is
commonly known as the "Gallagher Amendment" and is limited by
section 20 of article X of the state constitution (TABOR). Under the
Gallagher Amendment, there are 2 important classes of property for the
purposes of determining the residential assessment rate: Residential
property and nonresidential property. The assessment rate for most
nonresidential property is fixed in the state constitution at 29%. The
residential assessment rate was initially set at 21%, but the rate has since
been adjusted prior to each 2-year reassessment cycle to keep the
percentage of aggregate statewide assessed value attributable to
residential property the same as it was in the year immediately preceding
the new reassessment cycle. For the current reassessment cycle, the
residential assessment rate is 7.15%.
The concurrent resolution repeals the Gallagher Amendment so
that the general assembly will no longer be required to establish the
residential assessment rate based on the formula expressed in the
Gallagher Amendment. The resolution also repeals the reference to the
residential rate of 21%, which last applied in 1986, prior to the first
adjustment required by the Gallagher Amendment. Finally, the resolution
repeals the 29% assessment rate that applies for all nonresidential
property, excluding producing mines and lands or leaseholds producing
oil or gas.

Federal Update for June 2 Meeting of the Communications and Government
Relations Committee

Democrats make the first move towards a fourth COVID relief package
Pelosi, McConnell, White House are taking different approaches to COVID 4
After passing the third COVID Relief Package (CARES Act) – which included $25 billion for transit
– and COVID 3.5 (with additional funding for healthcare and the Paycheck Protection Program),
the White House and Congressional leaders are now discussing what to include in the fourth
COVID package. House Democrats on May 15 passed HR 6800, the Health and Economic Recovery
Omnibus Emergency Solutions (HEROES) Act, a nearly $3 trillion relief bill as their fourth package.
While the bill is important in that it telegraphs the Democratic priorities for the next COVID relief
package, it will likely go unconsidered by the Senate, especially as it was written, introduced, and
passed without any input from House Republicans.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) announced the Senate would turn its attention to
additional COVID relief when it returns from recess the week of June 1. However, Senate Finance
Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) noted negotiations on that package would have to wait
until later in the month, as there are still billions of dollars of CARES Act funds that have not yet
been distributed, so it is challenging to assess additional needs at the current time.
Supplemental Transit Funding
The HEROES Act did include several provisions relevant to transit agencies, including another
$15.75 billion in grants on top of the $25 billion provided under the CARES Act. While substantial,
this funding falls short of the $24 billion request from the American Public Transportation
Association (APTA). The bulk of the HEROES Act funding for transit ($11.75 billion) would be
apportioned to the fourteen largest metropolitan areas (populations over 3 million), based on 2010
Census data, and an additional $4 billion would be allocated by US DOT through a competitive
program. While additional funding is beneficial, the formula apportionments would not benefit
RTD in their current form. As such, SPB has alerted all members of RTD’s Congressional
delegation, Senate Banking Committee staff, and Senate Transportation/HUD Committee staff of
our concerns with this formula.

We made sure Congressional staff understood that the proposed formula – which relied on
just one of several metrics annually used to apportion transit funds – shortchanged the
Denver region, which has much higher per-capita transit use than several of the 14 cities that
would receive funds.
We also explained how reliance on 10-year-old population numbers meant fast-growing
cities like Denver were overlooked, and we made clear that the current population of RTD’s
service area exceeds 3 million people – the HEROES Act funding threshold.

While there is no expectation the HEROES Act will become law, it remains critical to address
funding inequities like this as they arise, while further negotiations continue between House
Democrats and Senate Republicans on the fourth COVID package. We pushed instead for another
nationwide grant award to all transit agencies in line with the APTA request, while also making clear
that, should the House insist on its HEROES provision, RTD does meet that bill’s 3 million
population requirement to receive formula funds.
Hazard Pay for Essential Workers
The HEROES Act would also recognize and compensate essential work during the pandemic with a
$200 billion hazard pay program. “Essential work” is defined to include providing public
transportation by bus or rail. Eligible employers would receive Federal grants to provide essential
workers with premium pay, up to $10,000 per worker (reduced to $5,000 for highly compensated
workers making over $200,000 per year).
Under this program, “essential work” must be performed during the period beginning on January
27, 2020, and ending 60 days after the last day of the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency. Work
may not be performed through telework and must require regular, in-person interactions with
patients or the public.
RTD briefs Senate Delegation on current operations, anticipated revenue shortfalls
Capitalizing on our longstanding and productive relationship with our Congressional delegation,
CFO Heather McKillop and SPB briefed staff from Senators Gardner and Bennet’s offices on May
21. The purpose of this briefing was to ensure staffers understood RTD’s current operations and
the agency’s financial needs both this year and next, as the Senate will begin considering its next
COVID relief measure in the coming weeks.
Ms. McKillop outlined how she anticipated that 2021 revenue losses would match 2020 losses. She
explained how the return of the $29 million CRP on our repaid RRIF loan would be more welcome
than ever as RTD addresses the pandemics’ multiple impacts of lost revenues, significant service
changes, and new expenses. Staff were interested in understanding ridership losses, changes to
capital project plans, and potential furloughs. Senator Gardner’s staffer informed us she had already
discussed with Senate Transportation/HUD staff earlier in the week our RRIF CRP refund and the
inequities of the HEROES Act transit formula.
Staffers from both offices were interested in further updates on RTD’s operations and finances as
the agency navigates the pandemic, and we provided the staffers with the results of RTD’s
Coronavirus online survey, per their request.

Protest Summary

Below, I have compiled a written report that outlines the various activities taken by Bus
Operations to include our Contractors, Rail Operations, Paratransit Operations, Safety and
Security, as well as Communications and Marketing. We continue to gather intel and reports
on a daily basis, and meet with SLT to determine next steps and maintain our current approach
to service delivery. Should we need to divert from our current operations, we discuss how we
should deliver our services for the following day.
During this process, we were in regular contact with our Board members, employees and the
media, to provide them with updates.

Thursday, May 28, 2020
BUS
At approximately 7:12 pm Bus Dispatch informed Bus Operations staff that Civic Center
Station (CCS) and the area around Colfax and Broadway had to be closed due to
heavy protest and police activity.
•

•
•

Buses were detoured and Street Supervisors were sent to assist. Bus Dispatch
was also informed that DPD indicated RTD may need to also close Denver Union Station
(DUS).
Shortly afterwards, DUS was closed and services to the area were re-routed.
Employees and customers trapped in DUS sheltered in place for their safety during the
event.
During this period, there were reports of rioting and looting throughout the 16 th Street
corridor and surrounding areas.
At 1:14 am both stations were cleared to open for the service day on Friday,
May 29, 2020.

Attachment: Protest Summary - By Date (4218 : Protest Discussion)

Over the course of the last several days, starting on Thursday, May 28th thru Monday, June 1st
RTD took a measured approach towards delivering transit services throughout the region. Most
notably was the decision to suspend RTD transit services going into and out of the downtown
area. We were faced with many factors in trying to address and deliver our customers as close
as we could to the downtown area without impacting the safety of our employees, customers
and equipment

RAIL
RTD was made aware that the protesting had turned violent in the downtown area.
The situation resulted in employees having to shelter in place for their safety, and exposing

Notified at home by Lieutenant Ballard that an unannounced protest has kicked off
and that there is a conflict on I-25. Denver Police were engaging and there were
random shots fired. Denver Police were not expecting this and a command post
was not established.
Shortly after, Lieutenant Ballard was on scene at DUS and was notified that this was an
aggressive crowd, and that they were heading towards Union Station via the
Millennial Bridge.
Lieutenant Ballard called Chief Grado and they decided to send a Transit Police
Officer to Civic, another to Union Station, and also dispatched our contracted
Denver Police Officers to Union Station. We also notified bus & rail to stop service
into the downtown area to protect our staff, customers and assets. Our teams brought
staff and riders down to the bus concourse, secured the doors and sheltered in place
for several hours.
Transit Security Officers posted at Civic Center were advised to lock the
facility and to shelter in place.
Later in the evening it was determined that the protest was centralized near the
Capital so we began the process to evacuate staff and riders from the concourse. All
buses were returned to District Shops.
Several buses were trapped by aggressive protestors, and a Bus Ops Street
Supervisor was approached by individuals that slashed one of his tires.
At this time, I spoke to CSSO Mike Meader and Tim Lucero and recommended that we
stop all service to the downtown area through the next day because of the
aggressiveness and gun fire that was being experienced.
Denver Police also notified us that some of the people arrested had affiliation to a violent
group that was associated with homemade explosives.

our equipment to possible damage. With the first closure of DUS due to the protesters being
in the area, there were two trains and Operators held in the trail track.
• At this time, trains began to turn at Empower Field. As the protest accelerated, we did
secure the out of service DUS trains and took the Operators to the DUS Bus area where
they remained due to safety concerns.
• As the protest continued and the Police began to use the Pepper pellets and tear gas,
we successfully and safely removed our existing service trains from the
Downtown loop into safe locations; turning the existing trains at 10th & Osage and
suspending the L Line service.
• All employees and equipment were moved to safe locations with no reported incidents
and in a safe manner.

The team determined boundaries (see attached) to stop service delivery. Based
upon these boundaries, Street Operation’s staff created detours and safe layover
locations for twenty-four (24) routes impacted.
Details of these impacts were shared with the Communications Team, our Private
Contractors, the entire Bus Operations Team, and the Senior Leadership Team.
Service was suspended shortly after 11 am on Friday and continued through June
1, 2020. Extra supervision was added throughout the course of events to support field
activities.
Robin McIntosh reported a broken window at CCS.

At approximately 2:00 am we received the “all clear” notification that normal train service
could resume. Normal service resumed Friday morning.

SLT met Friday morning and a decision was made to suspend all service to the
downtown area beginning at 11 am.

The following adjustments to service were made:
Light Rail:

L Line suspended entirely
H Line terminated at 10th & Osage Station
The C, E and W Lines terminated at Empower Field

Senior Leadership Team, in light of the previous evening’s activities, determined that for the
safety of employees and passengers, services to the Central Business District
needed to be suspended by 11 am.

Commuter Rail
•
•
•
•

A Line operated between Central Park and Denver International Airport
B Line operated between Westminster and 41st/Fox
G Line operated between Wheat Ridge/Ward and 41st/Fox

Directions were given to quickly suspend any operation that could potentially place
employees, passengers and equipment at risk. To this point, there have been no
adjustments to the planned suspension boundaries, although Sunday night crowds
expanded their boundaries threatening the R Line service and downtown
service to 10th and Osage.

Neither the LRV Maintenance nor Maintenance of Way Departments reported
any negative impacts. Communication to both departments was effective keeping
employees in safe locations. Both departments did report an increase in
vandalism/graffiti to equipment and infrastructure.

•

•
•
•
•

Upon learning of the intended fixed-route/light rail closures, we identified all trips in/out
of downtown for the day. We subsequently reached out to those passengers in
order to inform them that out of an abundance of concern for their well-being, we were
cancelling their trips.
Passengers who were already dropped off earlier in the morning were contacted and
asked to reschedule their ride home for an earlier time.
No trips were scheduled for the downtown area on Saturday and Sunday.
In light of the continuing service shut town for Monday, individuals who had trips
scheduled to/from downtown were contacted tonight and advised that their
trip was being cancelled.
Relative to First Transit Call Center staff who rely on RTD for transport to/from
work, we provided a shuttle on Monday, by way of Access-a-Ride, from a Park-nRide outside of the riot zone.

Denver Police Activated an EOC / Police Operations Command Post. Lieutenant Ballard
and Officer Blanchard are sent to get briefings. It was determined at that time that the
Denver downtown area would have thousands of protestors coming to the
area, and the organization (Antifa) had plans to create disruptions to the
organized “Black Lives Matter” peaceful protest. Officer Blanchard was assigned
to the DPD Command Post to feed intel to the RTD Transit Police.
During this time, the Denver Police Department stated that they were very grateful
that RTD decided to keep our services out of the downtown area to eliminate
potential attacks to our vehicles.
Further, the Downtown Partnership sent out notices to all downtown business to be
aware of potential vandalism, and to take proactive measures to protect
property.
Early this same morning, Mr. Meader advised Chief Grado that SLT was considering
keeping the downtown services closed for the day. Chief Grado agreed with this
decision and once again was thanked by DPD.
The Denver Police Department set up a command post at the Civic Center
Station because of large stones that were in the landscape and were used to injure
police officers, as well as break windows at the Capital.
Because of DPD’s heavy presence at Civic Center, we pulled all of our police /
security resources and redeployed them to the DUS property. This proved to be a

At 1:44 pm Chief Grado informed Bus Operations that an 8 pm curfew had been put into
effect, and that the National Guard had been activated.

Protestors remained peaceful during the daytime hours. The “Black Lives Matters”
protestors rescheduled an evening protest to 12 pm to avoid aggressive Antifa
members.
Chief Grado participated in a meeting with the City of Denver with a request to
remove the large landscaping rocks at Civic Center to protect officers and
property. RTD’s SLT gave Denver permission with a promise to restore it, at the cities
expense, when the unrest settles.
At night there were several incidents where crowds of more than 1,000 gathered
around DUS. At one point they became aggressive and tear gas / flashbangs were
deployed to get them to leave the area. No damage to property was noted.

Overall, the detours and layovers established by Street Operations worked
well. There were minor adjustments throughout the course of events to a few layover
points based upon complaints from neighborhood residents.

What Went Well?
•
•

•

Once the decision was made to suspend all service to the downtown area, overall
operations went well.
Direction given to staff to be alert to protests “spilling” beyond original boundaries
requiring further suspension. This resulted in staff being prepared to make any
necessary adjustments.
Internal communication with Light Rail and Commuter Rail worked well.

2.E.1.a

•
•
•
•

Phone call “check-ins” with SLT went well to discuss developments and assist in
decision making
Staff was professional and committed to accomplish the task set before them.
Communication externally through the Communications Department went well.
Train Operators were able to make announcements and stations signs provided
information to our customers.

•

•

Information/communication about the severity of the situation should have
been provided sooner so that consideration could have been made to suspend service
in the downtown area sooner than Thursday night; until it was determined the entire
event had concluded. There were no incidents, injuries or damage as a result, but the
potential was created.
Employees and equipment got “trapped” at DUS Thursday evening. This
required employees to shelter in place at DUS, and exposed equipment to potential
damage by being left unattended.

Suggestions for Future Events
•

Many were not made aware that an 8 pm curfew had been implemented by the City
and County of Denver. Ready Ops should be used more widely in a crisis such
as this.
