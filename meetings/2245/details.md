No recommended actions were presented.

#### 1. Civil Rights Division- 2014 Annual Report

Zamy Silva, Acting Senior Manager for Civil Rights, thanked the Directors for the opportunity to present the Civil Rights Department highlights for 2014.  The Civil Rights 2014 Annual Report was included in the February 10, 2015 Civil Rights Committee Agenda packet.  A hard copy of the Annual Report was available for each Director during the meeting. Zamy Silva thanked Adrina Gibson, Compliance Officer, and Mica Maniece, Workforce Initiative Now (WIN) Specialist, for their work on the Annual Report.

Zamy Silva and Martell Dyles, WIN Program Manager, reviewed the presentation included in the February 10, 2015 Civil Rights Committee Agenda packet. The presentation included an overview of the 2014 Annual Report, an overview of the 2014 events conducted and attended, and the 2015 goals for the division.

Director Folska commended Zamy Silva and the Civil Rights Department for their work and passion.  She asked if any disabled-owned businesses were accounted for on the spreadsheet with the information from the Census Bureau on the Annual Report.  Zamy Silva replied that the spreadsheet is meant to be a look at Colorado’s composition when it comes to Disadvantage Business Enterprises (DBE) and Small Business Enterprises (SBE) certified businesses.  No line item represents disable-owned businesses.  Director Folska hopes that moving forward in 2015 the disabled business community would be included in every aspect of RTD operations.  Phil Washington, General Manager, added that there is no Federal category to track Americans with Disability Act (ADA) businesses but staff will look into identifying and tracking these businesses.

Director Solano wondered if the Equal Opportunity (EO) videos referred to in the Annual Report were produced in house.  Zamy Silva replied that they were and that most of them were recordings of classes.

Director Menten asked if RTD did certifications as she was under the impression that the City and County of Denver (Denver) was responsible for them.  Zamy Silva replied that Denver does the DBE certification.  RTD opted to create its own SBE certification program.  RTD is responsible for certification and monitoring these locally funded projects.

Director Menten mentioned that she met with Dennis Gallagher, City Auditor for the City and County of Denver (Denver).  They measure success by how many firms graduate from their program.  Director Menten asked how RTD measures success.  Zamy Silva said that Denver’s DBE certification program is different: once a business has a 3 year revenue average sales greater than $23.98 million they graduate from the DBE Program.  RTD’s certification has a 4 category system in which similarly sized businesses are placed in the same category.  The idea is that firms of the same size are competing with each other for the same projects. Director Menten wondered if firms stay within their categories for an extended period of time.  Phil Washington replied that it is considered a success when firms move to the next revenue category.  The top category will be changed to $23 million in accordance with new Federal DBE regulations.  He added that no firm working with RTD has reached that level in the past 12 months.  The Civil Right Department actively monitors the certifications.  Director Menten asked if the number of employees affects the category placement.  Zamy Silva answered that Federal regulations look at different things depending on the industry.  For example they will look at the average 3 year revenue for engineering firms.  For supplier and manufacturer firms, Federal guidelines look at the average 3 year revenue, size of company, and personal net worth of the socially disadvantage individual.  She added that the intent of the program is to have firms graduate.  She pointed out that some firms do not want to graduate as they may lose business once they lose their certification.  Sometimes firms pass on jobs in order to remain at their current level.  Director Menten noted that it may be because RTD is providing them with the fish and they do not want to pick up the fishing rod.

Director Deadwyler said that she was under the impression that RTD did dual certifications for DBE and SBE.  Zamy Silva clarified that there are two individual certifications: the DBE certification through Denver and the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) and RTD’s SBE certification.  Those that qualify for DBE most likely will qualify for SBE.  Firms that are certified for both have the opportunity to participate in both locally and federally funded projects.  Director Deadwyler expressed that she was still confused.  She understands there are two separate programs.  She wondered if it is an automatic graduation if a DBE/SBE gets awarded both a DBE and an SBE contract.  Zamy Silva said that this was not necessarily the case.  Many firms that are both DBE and SBE participated in the West Corridor and are currently participating in the Eagle P3 project.  She noted that maximizing opportunities does not necessarily mean that they will graduate from the program; it does provide for more project prospects.  Phil Washington replied that graduation happens when the 3 year average revenue surpasses $23 million in annual revenue.  Having both DBE and SBE work would not necessarily take them over the threshold.  Director Deadwyler asked if firms are then considered prime/large business if they cross over the $23 million.  Zamy Silva replied that a firm that crosses the $23 million threshold loses their SBE certification.  She noted that firms that may have started working on FasTracks as a category 1 are now at a 2 or 3 level.

Committee Chair Walker pointed out that it may be possible that some businesses would not want to grow as they may enjoy the pace of a small business.  He wondered if it has been harder to attract WIN participants since the economy started bouncing back.  He noted the common place notion that good employees are hard to come by during a good economy.  Martell Dyles said that enrollment has picked up.  Many seem to want to grow with the economy.  Committee Chair Walker asked if people were looking for a specific type of position.  Martell Dyles replied that there is interest in all types of positions.  Staff steers applicants toward transit positions.  He mentioned that some construction participants are transitioning into transit as construction projects come to completion.
