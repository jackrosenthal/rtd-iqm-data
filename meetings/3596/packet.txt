BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Drug and Alcohol Policy Amendments

January 17, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
January 30, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the amendments to the RTD Drug and Alcohol Policy (Policy)
mandated by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) of the United States Department of Transportation
(DOT).
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Charlene Polege, Chief People Officer
Edin Memic, Manager, HR DOT Compliance
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 Minutes
BACKGROUND
The FTA requires that recipients of Section 5307, 5309, 5311, or 5339 funds that have safety-sensitive
employees have an FTA-compliant drug and alcohol testing program in place for such employees and a
supporting drug and alcohol policy adopted by the appropriate governing body or other “final authority”
entity. Further, the drug and alcohol policy must also comply with DOT regulations. The RTD Board of
Directors last approved the Policy on March 4, 2013. Except for minor corrections and updates, the
Board is responsible for approving all substantive amendments to the Policy.
In accordance with the Colorado Labor Peace Act, RTD is required to negotiate directly with the
Amalgamated Transit Union 1001 (ATU 1001) any terms of employment that impact working conditions
(e.g., wages, hours, scheduling, work rules, work assignments and job protection provisions, and
grievance and arbitration procedures).
DISCUSSION
The most recent amendments to the drug and alcohol policy represent regulatory amendments to include
but not limited to updates to positions that are deemed “safety-sensitive” under FTA regulations, the
inclusion of unambiguous language that conforms with the Drug Free Workplace Act (DFWA) of 1988,
synchronized “removal from service language” aligned to the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA)
Policy, and simplification and updates to DOT testing procedures.
Additionally, the Parties (RTD and ATU 1001) negotiated amendments impacting the working conditions
of represented staff to include, but not limited to implementing progressive discipline for not reporting
medication use when required by law, inclusion of “instant testing” to testing procedures, and
enhancement of employee accommodation language concerning “end of shift testing.”

FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no negative fiscal impact associated with this action. However, the implementation of instant
testing is projected to save $70K annually. Further, as recipients of Section 5307, 5309, 5311, or 5339
funds, non-compliance with the DOT and FTA regulations may impact RTD’s ability to receive federal
funds.

1.0 General Policy Statement
The Regional Transportation District is dedicated to providing safe, dependable, and
economical transportation services to the public, and to providing a healthy, safe and
satisfying work environment for our employees. RTD and the Amalgamated Transit Union,
Local 1001, agree that employees of the system must be able to work in a drug and
alcohol-free work environment. At the same time, every effort must be made to protect
the rights and respect the privacy of all employees. The employer has the right and duty
to protect its employees, passengers and the public from the adverse effects of drug and
alcohol abuse. It is not the intent of the employer to restrict the employees' off-the-job
conduct.
A successful drug and alcohol program must address the safety implications of drug and
alcohol abuse and must also institute proper procedures and controls guaranteeing accurate
alcohol and drug testing results, while preserving confidentiality and focusing on
rehabilitation through an effective Employee Assistance Program (EAP).
Even though some substances for which RTD tests are legal, their use may have
significant safety impacts. Therefore, it is the responsibility of all employees to report to
work free of alcohol and controlled substances. At the same time, every effort must be
made to protect and respect employees' rights and privacy.
To meet these goals and comply with legal requirements, RTD has implemented this policy
to (1) detect drug or alcohol use in violation of this policy through testing; (2) encourage
employees to obtain treatment and rehabilitation for drug and alcohol problems; (3)
deter drug or alcohol use in violation of this policy through education, training, and
discipline; and (4) enforce RTD's goal of a drug and alcohol-free work environment through
appropriate discipline.
Drug and alcohol abuse can have profound effects on the health, work, and personal life
not only of the abuser but also the abuser's family, friends, and the public at large.
Employees should be aware of the signs and symptoms of drug or alcohol problems, and
of available methods of intervening when a substance abuse problem is suspected.
Appendix A to this policy contains additional discussion of these matters.
This policy was originally adopted by the RTD Board of Directors on October 18, 1994, and
subsequent major modifications were adopted by the RTD Board of Directors on September
1998, July 2000, May 2003, July 2011, and March 2013. Many elements of this policy are
FRA covered employees performing “regulated services” are subject to random drug and alcohol testing and other requirements under a separate FRA policy that govern
those specific provisions. This policy applies to FRA covered employees to the extend it does not conflict with the FRA policy. In such cases, the FRA policy shall control.

required by federal regulations covering persons in safety-sensitive job classifications. Other
elements of this policy are not required by federal regulations but are official RTD policy.
Appendix B to this policy explains which elements of this policy are not federally required.
Employees wishing to review federal regulations on drug and alcohol use may contact RTD's
Drug and Alcohol Program Manager (DAPM).
This policy supersedes all other RTD drug, alcohol, or substance abuse policies. To the
extent that any elements of this policy may conflict with federal or state regulations as
they may be amended or revised in the future, the regulations shall control. Employees
are expected to review, be familiar with, and obey this policy and all laws concerning drug
and alcohol use and testing. All existing and new RTD employees must receive at least 60
minutes of training on the effects and consequences of prohibited drug use on personal
health, safety, the work environment, and the signs and symptoms which may indicate
prohibited drug use.
Compliance with this policy, including participation in RTD's drug and alcohol testing
program, is a required condition of employment.

2.0 Applicability
2. 1 Categories of Employees
This policy applies to all safety-sensitive and non-safety-sensitive RTD employees,
volunteers, and contractors. For ease of reference, all of the above persons are
referred to in this policy as "employees" unless otherwise noted. This policy applies
to all employees while on the property of RTD to perform RTD duty or while
performing any RTD-related business. Visitors and vendors are expected to adhere
to this policy while on RTD property. Non-compliance with this policy may result in
immediate and permanent removal from RTD premises.
In addition to being subject to all other elements of this policy, employees who
perform "safety- sensitive functions" for RTD, as that term is defined in federal
regulations 49 CFR Parts 40 as amended and Part 655, are subject to random drug
and alcohol testing and other special requirements set forth in this policy. Generally,
a safety-sensitive function occurs when an employee is performing, ready to perform
or immediately available to perform any duty related to the safe operation of public
transportation.
FRA covered employees performing “regulated services” are subject to random drug and alcohol testing and other requirements under a separate FRA policy that govern
those specific provisions. This policy applies to FRA covered employees to the extend it does not conflict with the FRA policy. In such cases, the FRA policy shall control.

The following are safety-sensitive functions:
1.

Operation of a revenue service vehicle, whether or not such vehicle
is in revenue service.

2.

Controlling dispatch or movement of a revenue service vehicle.

3.

Maintaining revenue service vehicles or equipment used in revenue service.

4.

Operating a non-revenue service vehicle when required to be
operated by a holder of a CDL.

5.

Carrying a firearm for security purposes.

6.

Supervising, where the supervisor actually performs any function
listed in items 1-5 above.

RTD reviews the actual duties performed by employees in all job classifications to
determine which employees perform safety-sensitive functions, and determines
which job functions may require the performance of safety-sensitive duties. An
analysis will be performed if any new job classifications are developed, or current job
description changes, to determine if the job should be considered safety-sensitive
by querying the policy.
During that process, Manager, Total Rewards engages with the DAPM to determine
if the positions will fall in one of the safety-sensitive categories, and quarterly audit
of new and changed positions will be conducted to confirm safety-sensitive category
assignments.

2.2 Categories of Prohibited Substances
This policy applies to controlled substances (see section 2.2.1
of this policy); legal drugs or medications which may impair
mental functioning, motor skills or judgment (section 2.2.2);
and alcohol (section 2.2.4). For ease of reference, these
substances are collectively referred to in this policy as
"prohibited substances" unless otherwise noted.
2.2.1 Controlled Substances
Controlled substances are any drug or other substance
identified in Schedules I through V of the federal Controlled
Substance Act (21 USC section 801 et seq.), federal
regulations at 21 CFR sections 1300.11 through 1300.15, and
the Colorado Controlled Substance Act (CRS section 12-22301), all as amended. Controlled substances include, but are
not necessarily limited to: marijuana, cocaine, opioids,
amphetamines, and PCP (phencyclidine).
2.2.2 Legal Drugs or Medications
The appropriate use of legally prescribed drugs or over-thecounter medications are not prohibited. However, the use of
any legally prescribed drug or medication which carries a
warning label that indicates that mental functions, motor skills,
or judgment may be adversely affected must be discussed by
employees with their appropriate health care professional
before performing work-related duties. Employees are urged
to seek and obtain medical confirmation prior to using
prescription or over the counter drugs to assure that such
consumption will not adversely affect their ability to safely
perform essential job functions. Appendix C contains
guidelines for use of prescribed drugs and over-the-counter
medications and a partial list of some over-the-counter
medications that may affect your ability to drive.

A legally prescribed drug is one for which the employee has a
prescription or other written authorization from a licensed
health care provider permitted by law to prescribe or dispense
drugs or medications. The authorization must include the
employee's name, the name of the substance, the amount to
be taken, and the period of authorization. Not reporting
medications use to the medical provider when required by the
law may lead to discipline.
2.2.3 Medical and Recreational Marijuana
Colorado law on the use of medical and recreational marijuana
does not amend, exempt, or supersede RTD's Drug and
Alcohol Policy. The Department of Transportation's Drug and
Alcohol Testing Regulation 49CFR Part 40, section 40.151
(e) does not authorize verification of a test based on
information that a physician recommended that the employee
use a drug listed in Schedule I of the Controlled Substances
Act (e.g., under a state law that purports to authorize such
recommendations, such as the medical marijuana" laws that
some states have adopted). The MRO will not verify a drug
test as negative based upon learning that the employee used
"medical or recreational marijuana" when states have passed
"medical or recreational marijuana" initiatives.
2.2.4 Alcohol
Alcohol is a colorless, volatile liquid that is the intoxicating agent in
fermented and distilled beverages. It also includes ethyl-alcohol or
other low molecular weight alcohols including methyl or isopropyl
alcohol. Alcohol can be found in certain medications, candy, energy
drinks, as well as in alcoholic beverages.
2.3 Hours of Compliance
Testing is conducted on all days and hours throughout the year.
Employees are subject to this policy while on RTD duty, while on the
property of RTD to perform RTD duty, while driving RTD vehicles, and
FRA covered employees performing “regulated services” are subject to random drug and alcohol testing and other requirements under a separate FRA
policy that govern those specific provisions. This policy applies to FRA covered employees to the extend it does not conflict with the FRA policy. In such
cases, the FRA policy shall control.

when the break ends. Employees are subject to this policy on regularly
scheduled days, and when volunteering for or assigned to extra work on
days off, holidays, etc. Safety-sensitive employees are also subject to this
policy at additional times set forth in section 3.4 of this policy.
3.0

Prohibited Conduct; Discipline

Discipline under this policy is independent of discipline for violation of any
other performance code or work rules. For example, an employee who
causes an accident and tests positive for alcohol use may receive
separate, consecutive penalties for both the accident and the positive
test.
In addition to any disciplinary action taken under this policy, law
enforcement authorities may be notified where criminal activity is
suspected in connection with any of the following prohibited conduct.
3.1

Possession/Use of Prohibited Substances at RTD

Any employee found to manufacture, distribute, dispense, sell, possess,
or use prohibited substances while on RTD duty, while on the property of
RTD to perform RTD duty, while driving RTD vehicles, and on lunch or
other breaks if the employee is scheduled to return to work when the
break ends, may be subject to discipline up to and including termination
of employment. All employees are required to notify RTD of any criminal
drug statute conviction for a violation occurring in the workplace within
five days after such conviction.
3.2

Intoxication/Under Influence

Any employee reasonably suspected of being intoxicated by, impaired by,
or under the influence of a prohibited substance, or of being not fit for
duty due to use of a prohibited substance, while on RTD duty, while on
the property of RTD to perform RTD duty, while driving RTD vehicles,
and on lunch or other breaks if the employee is scheduled to return to
work when the break ends, may be immediately suspended from job
duties pending an investigation and verification of their condition. Any
employee found to be intoxicated by, impaired by, or under the influence
of a prohibited substance, or not fit for duty due to use of a prohibited

Positive Drug, or Alcohol Tests at 0.04 or above

Positive drug or alcohol tests may be subject to discipline up to and
including termination of employment as set forth in this policy. In
addition, sections 5.3 and 5.4 of this policy specify an employment
assessment and return-to-duty requirements following a verified positive
test (i.e., a positive confirmatory test for drug use or alcohol
concentration of 0.04 or greater).
Any time that an employee loses while removed from service pending
report of a confirmatory test (or for safety-sensitive employees, while
removed from service under section 5.1 of this policy) will be counted
towards disciplinary suspension time.
3.3.1 Alcohol Test of 0.02 but Less than 0.04
Federal law requires RTD to remove a safety-sensitive employee
from service as provided in section 5.1 of this policy if a
confirmatory breath alcohol test indicates an alcohol concentration
of 0.02 or greater but less than 0.04. To deter such conduct, a
safety-sensitive employee with a confirmatory breath alcohol test
of 0.02 or greater but less than 0.04 may receive the following
discipline:
1.

First violation: Removal from service for no less than
eight hours; warning letter; and recommendation that
the employee seek assistance from the Employee
Assistance Program ("EAP").
For a first violation when the employee has already
been subject to the return-to-duty requirements of

Any employee with a "verified positive" drug or alcohol test, as that
term is defined in section 3.3 of this policy (i.e., a positive
confirmatory test for drug use or alcohol concentration of 0.04 or
greater), may receive the following discipline:
1.

First violation: 20-working-day unpaid suspension to
termination, depending on circumstances. If discipline
is other than termination of employment, the employee

3.5 Noncompliance with Testing Requirements
Any employee who refuses to comply with an RTD request for drug or
alcohol testing, provides false information in connection with a drug or
alcohol test, or attempts to falsify drug or alcohol test results through
tampering, contamination, adulteration, or substitution of a test sample,
may be treated as if the employee had received a "verified positive" drug
test result (i.e., a positive confirmatory test for drug use or alcohol
concentration of 0.04 or greater), will be removed from service
immediately, and may be subject to discipline up to and including
termination of employment. In addition, noncompliance with testing
requirements may constitute a refusal to test for purposes of section
5.1 of this policy (removal of safety-sensitive employees from service).
"Refusal to comply" includes:
• Failure to appear for any test (except pre-employment test)
within a reasonable time as determined by RTD
• Failure to remain at the testing site until the testing process
is completed, except a pre-employment test
• Failure to attempt to provide a sufficient amount of urine,
breath or saliva specimen as required by FTA or DOT
regulations
• In the case of a directly observed or monitored collection in
a drug test, failure to permit the observation or monitoring
of your provision of a specimen
• Failure to provide a sufficient amount of urine or breath when
directed, and it has been determined, through a required
medical evaluation, that there was no adequate medical
explanation for the failure
• Failure or decline to take an additional drug test RTD or the
collector has directed you to take
•

Failure to undergo a medical evaluation, as directed by the
MRO as part of the verification process, or as directed by the
Designated Employer Representative (DER)

•

Failure to sign Step #2 of the Alcohol Testing Form ( ATF)

•

Failure to cooperate with any part of the testing process
For an observed collection, fail to follow the observer's
instructions to raise your clothing above the waist, lower
clothing and underpants, and turn around to permit the
observer to determine if you have any type of prosthetic or
other device that could be used to interfere with the
collection process

• Possess or wear a prosthetic or other device that could be
used to interfere with the collection process
• Providing a specimen that is verified as adulterated or substituted
• Admit to the collector or MRO that you adulterated or
substituted the specimen
For pre-employment only, failure to appear, aborting the collection before
the test commences, or failure to remain at the site prior to
commencement of test is NOT a test refusal.
A refusal to test constitutes violation of this policy and will be treated the
same as a positive test result. Refusal to test under RTD authority will
not be considered as a refusal to take a DOT-required test, however it
may carry similar consequences.
3.6

Criminal Convictions

Any employee who is convicted of a felony involving off-site purchase,
sale or distribution of a controlled substance, or who fails to immediately
notify their supervisor of any such conviction, may be subject to discipline
up to and including termination of employment.
3. 7 Noncompliance with Treatment Requirements
Under certain circumstances, federal law requires RTD to impose and
monitor treatment of RTD employees for substance abuse, and to set
aftercare and return-to- duty requirements (see sections 5.3 and 5.4 of
this policy). RTD may require employees to submit to a treatment as a
condition of employment when there is an actual knowledge or admission
of drug use or alcohol misuse. Any employee who refuses or fails to
comply with RTD requirements for substance abuse treatment, aftercare,

Drug and Alcohol Testing
Test Procedures

Employees may be required to submit to urine drug testing and/or breath
alcohol testing under circumstances set forth in this policy. Testing shall
be conducted in a manner to protect the rights of the employee, assure
the integrity of the drug and alcohol testing process, safeguard the
validity of the test results, and ensure that test results are attributed to
the correct employee. For split specimen collections, Collectors will use
techniques and equipment consistent with federal regulations and RTD
will contract laboratory facilities that have been approved by the federal
government. All federally mandated testing will be conducted consistent
with federal requirements of 49 CFR Parts 40, as amended, and Part 655.
The Union and RTD will cooperate to allow the Union reasonable
opportunity to review the Drug and Alcohol program subject to limits of
confidentiality. Such review may include, but is not limited to, credentials
of the MRO, Substance Abuse Professionals, Breath Alcohol Technicians,
Urine/Saliva Collectors, and testing laboratories.

confidentiality, information including, but not limited to, drug test
results, chain of custody forms, the random selection process, and
collection site procedures. RTD and the Union may jointly review literature
and research on alcohol and drug testing technology and procedures,
suggested changes and improvements to the program, and employee
education and training programs.
RTD will strictly adhere to all standards of confidentiality. Testing records
and results will be released only to those authorized by federal
regulations to receive such information. RTD will strive to protect
employees' rights to dignity, privacy, and confidentiality throughout the
testing process.
4.1.1

Drug Testing Procedures

RTD will designate a MRO to receive drug test results and
determine whether there is a legitimate medical explanation for
confirmed positive, adulterated, substituted, and invalid drug tests
results from the laboratory, or by an employee's medical condition.
The MRO will then report all test results to the RTD via electronic
file. The MRO shall be a licensed physician (Doctor of Medicine or
osteopathy) with knowledge of drug abuse disorders. In carrying
out their responsibilities, the MRO shall examine alternate medical
explanations for any positive test result. This action may include
conducting a medical interview and review of the individual's
medical history, or review of any other relevant biomedical factors.
The MRO shall review all medical records made available by the
tested individual when a confirmed positive test could have
resulted from legally prescribed medication. The MRO shall not,
however, consider the results of federally mandated urine samples
that are not obtained or processed in accordance with 49 CFR Part
40, as amended.
Pursuant to federal regulations, drugs to be tested for are
marijuana, cocaine, opioids, amphetamines, and phencyclidine
(PCP). (RTD reserves the right, not based on federal regulations,
to test for additional drugs including barbiturates, benzodiazepines

Quaalude), and nonamphetamine stimulants, by separate urine
specimen if there is reasonable suspicion of such drug use (see
section 4.2.2 of this policy).
An initial drug screen will be conducted on each urine specimen at
a laboratory certified by the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services (DHHS). For specimens that are not negative (at or above
initial cutoff concentration, as established by 49CFR Part 40, as
amended), a second, confirmatory, test will be performed using
currently approved method by Department of Health and Human
Services and consistent with Part 40. The second test will be
considered a "verified positive" test under this policy if the amounts
present in the confirming test are at or above the minimum
thresholds established by federal regulations 49 CFR Part 40, as
amended, and the MRO determines that the positive result was
caused by the unauthorized use of controlled substances.
Before verifying that an employee has a positive test result, the
MRO is responsible for contacting any such employee, on a direct
and confidential basis, to determine whether the employee wishes
to discuss the test or present a legitimate explanation for the
positive result. MRO staff may make the initial contact for the MRO
in order to schedule a discussion between the MRO and the
employee, as well as, explain the consequences if an employee
declines to speak with the MRO. If, after reasonable efforts, the
MRO is unable to reach the employee directly, the MRO may
contact RTD's Designated Employer Representative (DER) for
assistance in contacting the employee. RTD's DER will take
maximum precautions to preserve the confidentiality of the MRO
contact.
If, after making all diligent and reasonable efforts, neither the MRO
nor RTD's DER are able to contact the employee within ten (10)
days of the date the MRO received the confirmed positive test result
from the laboratory, the MRO may verify the test result as positive.

within time limits set forth in Part 40 if the employee presents
documentation of serious injury or illness or other circumstances
that unavoidably prevented the employee from being contacted
within the designated time period, and if the employee then
presents a legitimate (in the MRO's opinion) explanation for the

Alcohol Testing Procedures

Alcohol testing will be performed by a qualified Breath Alcohol
Technician (BAT) or Screening Test Technician (STT).
The BAT or STT must receive qualification training meeting the
requirements in 49 CFR Part 40, as amended. If the initial test
indicates an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater, a second,
confirmatory, test will be performed. If the confirmatory test
indicates an alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater, the
confirming test will be considered a "verified positive" test under
this policy.
4.2

Categories of Tests
4.2.1

Pre-Employment Drug Testing

All applicants for employment will be tested for drug use prior to
employment in any position at RTD, and prior to transfer from a
non-safety-sensitive position into a safety-sensitive position.
Receipt by RTD of a verified negative drug result is required prior
to employment or transfer. A verified positive test (i.e., a positive
confirmatory test for drug use) will disqualify an applicant from

Safety-sensitive employees who have been off duty for 90 days or
more for any reason, and have been out of the random pool, must
successfully pass a pre-employment drug test prior to the
performance of a safety-sensitive function.
4.2.2

Reasonable Suspicion Testing

An employee will be tested where there is reasonable
suspicion that the employee has engaged in drug or alcohol
use. Reasonable suspicion alcohol testing for safety-sensitive
employees shall be performed just before, during and just
following the performance of a safety-sensitive function. To
come under reasonable suspicion, the employee must be
observed by a supervisor trained in the detection of drug or
alcohol misuse. Supervisors who make reasonable suspicion
determinations of drug use shall receive at least 60 minutes
of training on the physical, behavioral, and performance
indicators of probable drug use. Supervisors designated to
determine whether reasonable suspicion exists for alcohol
testing shall receive at least 60 minutes of training on the
physical, behavioral, speech and performance indicators of
probable alcohol misuse.
Reasonable suspicion testing under Federal Transit
Administration (FTA) authority is required when one trained
supervisor can articulate and substantiate physical,
behavioral and performance indicators of probable drug use
or alcohol misuse by observing the appearance, behavior,
speech, or body odors of the employee, or physical signs and
symptoms consistent with use of prohibited substances.
Otherwise, examples of conditions which may result in
reasonable- suspicion evaluation or immediate testing under
RTD authority include, but are not limited to, the following:

4.2.3

Post-Accident Testing

In case of an accident involving any RTD vehicle (regardless of
whether or not the vehicle is in revenue service) that results in a
death, tests will be conducted on all employees on duty in the RTD
vehicle and on any other employee whose performance could have
contributed to the accident.
In case of a non-fatal accident in which an individual sustains
injuries requiring immediate treatment at a medical treatment
facility, the RTD vehicle is a bus, van or automobile and one or
more vehicles incur disabling damage that requires towing from
the site, or the RTD vehicle is a vehicle operating on rails and is
removed from revenue service, tests will be conducted on all
employees on duty in the RTD vehicle (unless the employee's
behavior can be completely discounted as a contributing factor
to the accident) and on any other employee whose performance
could have contributed to the accident.

The above post-accident testing procedures are separate from
reasonable- suspicion testing conducted under section 4.2.2 of
this policy.
Post-accident testing will be done as soon as possible, and no later
than eight hours after the accident for alcohol testing and 32 hours
after the accident for drug testing. An employee involved in an
accident must not use alcohol until after the employee undergoes
alcohol testing or eight hours have elapsed, whichever comes first.
Every effort will be made to conduct alcohol testing within two
hours after the accident. In the event the alcohol test is delayed
beyond two hours, RTD will prepare and maintain a record stating
the reason(s) for the delay. If an alcohol test is not administered
within eight hours following the accident, all attempts to administer
the test must cease and RTD must update the record.
Nothing in this policy shall be construed to require the delay of
necessary medical attention for the injured following an accident
or to prohibit an employee from leaving the scene of an accident
for the period necessary to obtain assistance in responding to the
accident or to obtain necessary emergency medical care.
However, any employee who under the above circumstances
fails to remain readily available for drug and alcohol testing
(including notifying RTD of their location), or who otherwise leaves
the scene of an accident without appropriate authorization prior to
submission to drug and alcohol testing, will be considered to have
refused the test. Under section 3.5 of this policy, leaving the
scene of an accident without valid reason is a serious violation
subject to discipline up to and including termination of
employment.

Return-to-Duty Testing

As part of the employment assessment and return-to-duty
requirements set forth in sections 5.3 and 5.4 of this policy, any

and alcohol testing after returning to work.
4.2.5

Random Testing

Employees in safety-sensitive positions will be subjected to
unannounced random drug and alcohol testing in accordance
with FTA regulation 655.45. Random selections shall be a
sufficient number of covered employees for testing during each
calendar year to equal an annual rate not less than the
minimum annual percentage rate of 10% of the safety-sensitive
workforce for alcohol and 50% for drugs or at the rates set forth
by the FTA in Part 655, as amended. This rate is subject to
annual review, as provided in 49CFR Part 655.45(b). Each such
employee shall be in a pool from which random selection is made.
Each such employee shall have an equal chance at selection and
shall remain in the pool even after being tested. The basis for
random selection shall be by a scientifically valid random
number generation method initiated by computer. To ensure
that employees have a reasonable expectation that they might
be called for a test on any day they are at work, the dates for
random testing shall be spread reasonably throughout the
calendar year. Random tests are unannounced and immediate.
Employees are required to proceed to the test site immediately
upon notification. Random testing may also be conducted
pursuant to other sections of this policy. A safety-sensitive
employee shall only be randomly tested for alcohol misuse just
before, during and just following the performance of a safetysensitive function. In addition, RTD Executive Leadership will be
expected to participate in random testing (testing of nonsafety-sensitive Executive Leadership is based on RTD's
independent authority and not federal regulations).
If an employee has a verifiable obligation for childcare, elder care,
or similar reasons, that will prevent them from remaining on-site
for an extended period of time at the end of their shift, written
request to the manager needs to be submitted in advance. The
FRA covered employees performing “regulated services” are subject to random drug and alcohol testing and other requirements under a separate FRA
policy that govern those specific provisions. This policy applies to FRA covered employees to the extend it does not conflict with the FRA policy. In such

request must contain contact information of the provider. The
manager will forward such requests to the HR DOT Compliance
Unit who will ensure that drug testing commences at least three
hours prior to the end of the shift to accommodate the employee’s
obligations. Any such request will need to be re-evaluated at least
annually.
4.3

Employee Status Pending Test Results
Employees who are tested for reasonable suspicion or postaccident testing will be immediately removed from service and will
not be allowed to return to work until test results are reported.
If a negative test result is reported, the employee will be notified
immediately, returned to work, and compensated for the period of
absence from work.
As a general rule, when an employee is sent for any other type of
test, the employee will not be removed from service pending
receipt of test results.

Consequences of Positive Tests
5.1

Special Consequences for Safety-Sensitive Employees

A safety-sensitive employee with a confirmatory alcohol test result of
0.02 or greater, but less than 0.04, shall be immediately removed from
service for a minimum of eight hours following the confirmatory test. A
safety- sensitive employee with a verified positive test (i.e., a positive
confirmatory test for drug use or alcohol concentration of 0.04 or
greater) shall be immediately removed from service until after an
employment assessment and release to return to duty by a Substance
Abuse Professional ("SAP") under section 5.3 of this policy.

Employment Assessment

5.3

Any employee with a verified positive test (i.e., a positive confirmatory
test for drug use or alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater) will be
immediately removed from duty and must be promptly assessed by a
Substance Abuse Professional (SAP). An SAP is either (1) a licensed
physician, or a licensed or certified psychologist, social worker, or
employee assistance professional with knowledge of and clinical
experience in the diagnosis and treatment of alcohol-and drug-related
disorders; or (2) an addiction counselor certified by the National
Association of Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Counselors Certification
Commission. The SAP will evaluate each employee to determine what
assistance the employee needs in resolving problems associated with
prohibited substance abuse or misuse.
Assessment by an SAP does not exempt an employee from discipline
and does not guarantee continued employment or reinstatement. The
cost of any treatment or rehabilitation services will be paid by the
employee or the employee's own insurance provider.
After the SAP determines that the employee has successfully complied
with prescribed education and/or treatment, the employee must
promptly follow the rehabilitation program prescribed by the SAP,
must pass a directly observed return- to-duty drug and/or alcohol test
(non-observed return-to-duty for positive/refusal results that were
collected under RTD authority), and must fulfill the return-to-duty
requirements of section 5.4 of this policy.
Return to Duty Requirements

5.4

Employees who re-enter the workforce following (1) completion of a
disciplinary suspension for a DOT verified positive drug or alcohol test
at or above 0.04 level, (2) a favorable employment assessment which
includes a medical exam for safety-sensitive employees, and (3)
successful return-to-duty testing, shall be subject to the following
requirements:
•

Unannounced observed follow-up drug and alcohol testing for one
to five years (1-5) depending on the circumstances of the case

must pass a minimum of six (6) follow-up tests within the first
twelve (12) months back in safety-sensitive duties.
•

An agreement to follow specified after-care requirements
recommended by the SAP, with the cost of such requirements
to be borne by the employee or the employee's own insurance
provider.

Compliance with all recommendations of the SAP, and release to
RTD from each treatment provider of records of attendance,
recommendations, and compliance.

An employee's violation of the above requirements may be grounds for
termination of employment under section 3. 7 of this policy.
Non-DOT violations if not resulting in termination of employment, will
have a similar return-to-work process as described in sections 5.4 and
6.0. All testing will be done under RTD authority.
6.0

Employees Who Seek Assistance Prior to Violations
Employees are strongly encouraged to seek assistance to overcome
alcohol or drug dependency problems before accidents or violations of
this policy occur. RTD is strongly committed to working in a positive
manner with such employees.
Employees who seek assistance with alcohol or drug dependency prior
to violation of this policy will be referred to the substance abuse
counselor who has the qualifications of a Substance Abuse Professional
(SAP) for appropriate treatment and/or rehabilitation program.
Employees will not be subject to discipline for their participation in such
programs. Employees participating in or completing a treatment or
rehabilitation program will continue to be required to comply with RTD
performance standards, policies, and rules and regulations, including but
not limited to this policy, and may be subject to discipline if these are
violated.
If determined necessary by RTD-approved medical professionals, medical
leaves of absence may be arranged to allow for proper treatment of
employees who seek assistance with alcohol or drug dependency, and

APPENDIX A
Regional Transportation District
Drug and Alcohol Policy

Materials on Drug and Alcohol Abuse
The attached materials contain discussion of the effects of drug and alcohol
abuse on the health, work, and personal life not only of the abuser but also
the abuser's family, friends, and the public at large. The materials also
discuss the signs and symptoms of drug and alcohol problems, and possible
methods of intervening.
NOTE: RTD provides its employees a confidential Employee Assistance
Program (EAP) which provides employees and their immediate families a
broad range of confidential counseling and referral services for personal
and job-related problems, including drug or alcohol abuse. The program
is available t w e n t y - f o u r ( 2 4 ) hours a day, seven (7) days a week.
The EAP provides up to eight (8) sessions of counseling for a problem
and, if warranted, refers the employee or family member to another
agency or helping facility. The employee is responsible for charges after
a referral is made; however, the EAP can often find an agency whose
services are free or covered by insurance. Sick leave may be used to visit
EAP counselors during regular business hours.

Drugs and Alcohol: Effects, Signs, and Solutions
One of every ten U.S. workers abuses alcohol or drugs. In fact, some
studies conclude that up to 20-25 percent of the nation's workforce may
be abusing alcohol or drugs. Experts estimate that there are 10 million
alcoholics in this country, 6 million current cocaine abusers, 16 to 20
million people who frequently use marijuana, and several million persons
who abuse prescription drugs.
Drugs and alcohol affect their users' judgment, performance, and safetyawareness, which in turn directly affects the safety and well-being of the
users' families, all other employees, and the public at large.
Effects of Drug and Alcohol Abuse
Drug and alcohol abuse affect a person physically and mentally. These effects
occur not only during actual intoxication (which can last from almost
immediately in the case of alcohol, to one to twenty-four (1-24) hours after
intake for other drugs), but also during residual hangovers, fatigue rebounds,
and longer periods of mental impairment. Physical and mental effects may
include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Slow reactions
Poor coordination
Fatigue
Delayed decision-making
Poor or erratic judgment
Confusion
Learning difficulties
Poor memory
Loss of concentration
Depression or anxiety
Difficulty in sorting out priority tasks
Neurotic or psychotic behavior
Refusal to accept authority

Drugs and alcohol can also lead to many serious physical problems. For
example, cocaine use - even in small amounts, or by first-time users -- has
been linked with heart attacks.
Amphetamine abuse can lead to strokes. Alcoholism can cause fatal
cirrhosis of the liver. Use of heroin and other intravenously injected drugs
expose the user to transmission of infectious diseases.
Some persons wrongly believe that marijuana is relatively "safe." However,
in addition to marijuana's links to many of the above physical and mental
disturbances, research indicates that marijuana is a "gateway" drug
leading to further drug use. Almost s i x t y ( 60) percent of marijuana
users will go on to use other drugs.
RTD's mission to provide safe and efficient public transportation is directly
threatened by employees' drug and alcohol abuse. For example, each year
approximately two million motor vehicle collisions occur that involve
drinking and driving, injuring 700,000 persons and killing 25,000 persons.
One of every two Americans will be involved in an alcohol- related traffic
accident in their lifetime.
Signs of Drug and Alcohol Abuse
The first signs of drug or alcohol abuse may be hard to distinguish from
signs of other problems such as job stress, overwork, fatigue, or emotional
problems. To make recognition even more difficult, drug- and alcoholabusing employees often develop survival skills to avoid detection.
Supervisors and co-workers need to be aware of the following general
signs of drug and alcohol abuse:
•

Absenteeism or tardiness: Employees with substance abuse
problems may be absent an average of two to three times more than
the normal employee. They may exhibit a pattern of absences on
certain days, such as Mondays and Fridays.

•

Staff turnover: Chemically dependent people have disorganized
lives. Many quit rather than face detection; others transfer or are
fired for poor or unsafe performance.

FRA covered employees performing “regulated services” are subject to random drug and alcohol testing and other requirements under a separate FRA
policy that govern those specific provisions. This policy applies to FRA covered employees to the extend it does not conflict with the FRA policy. In such

Erratic performance; poor work quality: Mental and physical
agility and concentration deteriorate with substance abuse. The
abuser may miss deadlines, have poor concentration, work in bursts
of energy, and overlook important details. The person becomes
unreliable.

•

Poor morale: Substance abuse creates wide mood swings, anxiety
depression, and anger. Co-workers often see substance abusers as
poor "team workers" and safety hazards. Abusers often blame work
problems on someone or something else.

•

Increased accidents and "near-misses": Impaired employees are
3.6 times more likely to cause an accident. Even small quantities of
drugs or alcohol in the system can cause deterioration of alertness,
clear-mindedness, and reaction speed. For example, studies show
that a person's driving ability substantially decreases at a blood
alcohol content level of .04%. This is the equivalent of
approximately two (2) beers or one (1) martini consumed in one (1)
hour.

•

Theft: Drugs are expensive, and drug users need money to support
their habits. As substance abusers' value systems and judgment are
affected by drugs, their loyalty and dedication to their co-workers and
employers is weakened.

The following signs may also indicate involvement of drugs or alcohol in a
person's problems:
• Sudden changes, usually for the worse, in attitude, work performance, or
behavior
• A lackadaisical, "I don't care" attitude
• Deteriorating or erratic performance
• Hangover symptoms
• Drug-culture jargon
• Secretive behavior
FRA covered employees performing “regulated services” are subject to random drug and alcohol testing and other requirements under a separate FRA
policy that govern those specific provisions. This policy applies to FRA covered employees to the extend it does not conflict with the FRA policy. In such
cases, the FRA policy shall control.

• Wanting to be alone; avoiding "straight" co-workers
• Forgetfulness, indecision, erratic judgment
• Impulsive and temperamental behavior
• Changes in personal appearance or hygiene
• Jitters, hand tremors, hyperexcitability
• Carelessness
• Sleeping on the job
• Sudden weight loss
• Chronic cough or runny nose
• Sores around the nose, or marks on the arms

Note that each symptom, by itself, may point to problems other than
drug or alcohol abuse. However, when a pattern begins to develop, a
supervisor, manager, co-worker or family member needs to be alert and act
quickly. Fueled by drug or alcohol abuse, these behaviors can quickly lead
to accidents, productivity problems, higher operating costs, greater
absenteeism, and worsened service to the public.
Solutions for Drug and Alcohol Abuse
One of the biggest obstacles to overcome in trying to help or reach the drug
or alcohol abuser is denial. To overcome a drug or alcohol dependency, a
person must first and foremost be able and willing to recognize the problem.
However, some abusers, especially cocaine users, erroneously believe that
the drug improves their performance. Others insist that they can "control"
their addictions on their own. Denial must be confronted and overcome
before the abuser can begin to recover.
Supervisors and co-workers endanger the lives and safety of the abuser, and
their family, co-workers and the public, if they try to "cover up" for the
abusing employee or do the employee's work.
Co-workers and supervisors should not allow a suspected substance abuser
to continue working at a lower level and should not let friendship with the
employee or fear of exposing an "embarrassing" problem lead them into
concealing the problem. They should
not share in the abuser's denial by encouraging the abuser to believe that
they do not have a problem.
FRA covered employees performing “regulated services” are subject to random drug and alcohol testing and other requirements under a separate FRA
policy that govern those specific provisions. This policy applies to FRA covered employees to the extend it does not conflict with the FRA policy. In such
cases, the FRA policy shall control.

Co-workers and supervisors should pay attention to the warning signs of
drug and alcohol abuse, talk to the abuser about concerns you have for the
abuser's health or job, and refuse to cover up for or take excuses from the
abuser.
Supervisors should also know how to administer and apply RTD's Drug and
Alcohol Policy and other performance rules and policies.
Successful intervention in the workplace often starts with a frank, firm, but
sensitive discussion with the person, a n d b y focusing on problems with the
person's performance or safety. To deal with the person's likely denials,
problems should be clearly documented so that the person can be shown
clear-cut evidence of what is wrong.
Co-workers and supervisors should encourage a suspected abuser of drugs
or alcohol to seek assistance from RTD's Employee Assistance Program
(EAP). The abuser should be reminded that any help offered through the
EAP program is strictly confidential. Such EAP programs have 70-80 percent
success rates for substance abuse recovery. This is higher than rates for
other programs, because with EAP programs the employee has the
commitment of the company behind them.
A person dependent on drugs or alcohol can also be referred to their
personal health care provider or clergy member, to private alcohol or drug
treatment clinics, or to self-help groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous or
Narcotics Anonymous.
Additional information on drug and alcohol use and abuse can be obtained
from the EAP or RTD's Human Resources Department.

APPENDIX B
Regional Transportation District
Drug and Alcohol Policy

Non-Federally Required Elements of Policy
Many elements of RTD's Drug and Alcohol Policy are required by federal
regulations covering transit employees in safety-sensitive positions. Other
elements of RTD's policy are not required by federal regulations but are
official RTD policy. Federal regulations require RTD to identify which
provisions of its policy are mandated by the regulations and which are not.
The parts of the Regional Transportation District Drug and Alcohol Policy not
mandated by federal regulations are as follows:
1.

RTD's Policy applies to more than safety-sensitive employees
covered by federal regulations. It applies to all safety-sensitive and
non-safety-sensitive RTD employees, volunteers, and contractors.
Intent of the policy is to apply all provisions equally to all
employees, only changing the applicable authority when
appropriate. Visitors and vendors are also expected to adhere to
the Policy while on RTD property. (See Policy section 2.1.)

2.

RTD's Policy contains hours of compliance beyond those required
by federal regulations. Specifically, employees are subject to the
Policy while on RTD duty, while on the property of RTD to perform
RTD duty, while driving RTD vehicles, on lunch or other breaks if
the employee is scheduled to return to work when the break ends,
on regularly scheduled days, and when volunteering for or
assigned to extra work on days off, holidays, etc. (See Policy
section 2.3.)

3.

Discipline is not addressed in the federal regulations. (See Policy
sections 3.0 and 6.0.)

FRA covered employees performing “regulated services” are subject to random drug and alcohol testing and other requirements under a separate FRA
policy that govern those specific provisions. This policy applies to FRA covered employees to the extend it does not conflict with the FRA policy. In such
cases, the FRA policy shall control.

4.

Possession/use of prohibited substances, criminal convictions,
noncompliance with treatment requirements, improper use of
policy, monetary reimbursement, and prohibited substances on
RTD property are not addressed in the federal regulations. (See
Policy sections 3.1, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 4.1.1, 4.2.2, 5.4, and
6.0)

5.

The RTD-Union agreements for Union review of the Drug and
Alcohol Program, and for joint review, are not addressed in the
federal regulations. (See Policy section 4.1)

6.

RTD has reserved the right, not based on federal regulations, to
conduct reasonable-suspicion testing by separate urine specimen
for additional drugs including barbiturates, benzodiazepines (e.g.,
Valium, Librium, Xanax), nonbarbiturate sedatives (e.g.,
Quaalude,), and nonamphetamine stimulants. (See Policy section
4.1.1).

7.

The following tests for non-safety-sensitive positions are not
addressed in the federal regulations: Pre-employment,
Reasonable Suspicion, Post- Accident, Return-to-Duty, Follow-up
and Executive Leadership Random testing. (See Policy section
4.2.5)

8.

Provisions to encourage employees to voluntarily seek assistance
with alcohol or drug dependency by participating in appropriate
treatment and/or rehabilitation programs are not addressed in the
federal regulations. (See Policy section 6.0)

FRA covered employees performing “regulated services” are subject to random drug and alcohol testing and other requirements under a separate FRA
policy that govern those specific provisions. This policy applies to FRA covered employees to the extend it does not conflict with the FRA policy. In such
cases, the FRA policy shall control.

APPENDIX C
PRESCRIPTIONS AND OVER THE COUNTER
MEDICATIONS
•

Be Cautious. All medications, prescription (Rx) and over-the-counter
(OTC) medications have the potential to be dangerous. Use medications
cautiously and always in accordance with physician's directions. Do not
perform any safety-sensitive function while impaired by any medication;
however, this caution should not be construed to require any FTA covered
employee to delay or deny any necessary medical treatment.

•

Inform prescribing physician, dentist or other medical professional.
Before accepting any prescriptions, employees should inform their
physicians of their safety-sensitive position and explain their job duties. Do
not assume physicians will remember explanations from one visit to the
next. Employees are encouraged to:
o Remind their physician of any other medications they are taking
including those medications prescribed by other physicians
o Make sure their physician has their complete medical history
o Remember to ask their physician if they will be able to perform their
duties safely while taking prescribed medications
o Seek alternatives should recommended medications be deemed
unsafe

•

Solicit information from your pharmacist. Employees are encouraged to ask
their pharmacist for additional information about an Rx or OTC. A pharmacist
will be very knowledgeable about the medication ingredients, side- effects,
precautions, drug interactions, and effects when combined with other
drugs. Even if after receiving physician advice, employees are encouraged
to obtain more information. Pharmacists may be more knowledgeable and
able to provide additional information and insight. Read warning labels and
side-effects provided on information summaries provided with Rx and
OTC's.

FRA covered employees performing “regulated services” are subject to random drug and alcohol testing and other requirements under a separate FRA policy
that govern those specific provisions. This policy applies to FRA covered employees to the extend it does not conflict with the FRA policy. In such cases, the
FRA policy shall control.

•

Do not over-medicate. Always follow the prescription directly as
written. Never increase the dosage or frequency of use without explicit
directions from your doctor. Not only is this practice medically risky, but
increased dose of a medication may cause impairment when the same
medication used as recommended may not.

•

Check the strength of the prescription. Sometimes medicines are
prescribed in different strengths (i.e., 500 vs. 250 MG). Do not take a
pill without first checking the dosage and comparing it to the prescription,
even if the medication has been taken before or this is a refill.

•

Never take someone else's medication. This is illegal, dangerous,
and it may cause impairment.

•

Always monitor your reaction. After taking any medication (Rx or
OTC) watch for any side-effects including drowsiness, dizziness,
confusion, etc. Try to get accustomed to the medication first before
reporting for work. The same applies even if you have taken this
medication in the past with no previous side-effects. An individual's
reactions to a medication may vary with each treatment, the nature of
the illness and other medications taken.

•

Avoid Rx/OTCs that have been problems in the past. If you have
taken medications in the past that have caused negative side-effects,
make a note of the active ingredients and avoid these in the future.
Inform your prescribing physician of your problem with the previous
medications and ask for alternative medications that do not have this
ingredient. For OTCs read the ingredient portion of the label and ask
the pharmacist for assistance.

•

Ask for alternative treatments or dosage schedule. If you notice
side-effects that could pose a safety risk, consult your prescribing
physician (or pharmacist in the case of an OTC) about alternative
treatments, medications, dosages, or schedule of use. You may be able
to avoid the negative side-effects by simply shifting the dosage
schedule to take your medications following your shift rather than
before.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Sixth Amendment to GM/CEO Employment Agreement

January 17, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
January 30, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt a Sixth Amendment to the Employment Agreement with General
Manager and CEO Debra A. Johnson to increase her base salary by 1.8% from $395,120 to $402,325
effective November 9, 2023, consistent with the Board-adopted GM/CEO Compensation Philosophy and
Compensation Base Salary Range.
REPRESENTATIVE
Director Erik Davidson, Board Chair
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
On September 29, 2020, the Board and Ms. Johnson entered into an employment agreement
(Agreement), and subsequently the parties executed five amendments thereto.
Consistent with a recommendation from the Office of the State Auditor in a March 2010 Performance
Audit, the Board adopted a GM/CEO Compensation Philosophy on September 26, 2023, as a framework
to guide and anchor the Board’s compensation decisions related to the GM/CEO’s compensation. Under
the Compensation Philosophy, the GM/CEO’s compensation is designed “[d]emonstrate internal equity,
fairness, and transparency while being externally market competitive, aligned to the 50th percentile of
comparable public transit agencies, and related public and private sectors where executive talent may
reside.”
Per the Third Amendment to the Agreement, the Board engaged a third party by competitive solicitation
to conduct a compensation and benchmarking analysis (Compensation Analysis). Because the
Compensation Analysis data used to establish the recommended base salary range was nearly 12
months old, to remain competitive with the market, an aging factor was utilized to account for market
changes. On October 24, 2023, the Board adopted Compensation Base Salary Range of:
•

Minimum: $292,600 Midpoint: $402,325 Maximum: $512,050

The Employment Cost Index (ECI) measures changes in the cost of employees to employers over time. In
the private sector, business owners and human resources professionals can use the ECI to make
decisions about pay adjustments to help them stay competitive. In the public sector, the Federal Reserve

Packet Pg. 96

17.B

and others use the ECI to gauge the health of the labor market, adjust contracts, and research the labor
market. (Source: US Bureau of Labor Statistics)
DISCUSSION
Consistent with the Board-adopted GM/CEO Compensation Philosophy and Compensation Base Salary
Range, it is recommended that the Board adopt a sixth amendment to the Agreement to align Ms.
Johnson’s base salary with the midpoint of the salary range. The midpoint represents full market pay for
an employee whose knowledge, skills, and abilities allow them to fully perform the job duties.
Ms. Johnson’s education and more than 30 years of transit sector experience and more than 20 years of
senior C-suite leadership experience support placing her at the midpoint. Such placement aligns with the
Board’s commitment to being market competitive. In adopting this recommended action, the agency
seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan priorities of Employee Ownership.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Alignment of the GM/CEO’s base salary with the Board-adopted GM/CEO Compensation Philosophy and
Compensation Base Salary Range pursuant to this recommended action would result in a 1.8% increase
of Ms. Johnson’s base salary from $395,120 to $402,325 effective November 9, 2023.

Compensation Philosophy for the GM/CEO

RTD’s mission to make lives better through connections and vision to be the trusted transit leader in
mobility, delivering excellence, and value to our customers and community requires the expertise of a
highly skilled and seasoned executive capable of leading and inspiring an innovative, complex, and
unique multi‐modal transit agency.
An overarching goal of the Board of Directors is to attract, motivate and retain the requisite executive
talent necessary to achieve the agency’s mission and vision. The Board further acknowledges that
competition to attract a GM/CEO with the required suite of competencies, knowledge, and experience
is extremely challenging given the highly specialized transit environment. Therefore, RTD must be market
competitive on a Northern American scale in both public and private sectors when considering talent
acquisition and retention.
Furthermore, the following principles will guide the components of the GM/CEO’s total compensation.
Total compensation will be designed to:












Demonstrate internal equity, fairness, and transparency while being externally market
competitive, aligned to the 50th percentile of comparable public transit agencies, and related
public and private sectors where executive talent may reside
Comprise a component of pay‐for‐performance designed to motivate and incent performance
and retention
Incent agency, team, and individual performance aligned to the agency’s strategic objectives and
directly linked to a pay‐for‐performance framework
Provide appropriate opportunities for personal and professional development
Recognize the value in compensation components that directly support the health and welfare
of the GM/CEO today (e.g., health [including dedicated executive health benefits], dental, vision,
PTO, executive leave) and into the future (e.g., deferred compensation, retiree health benefits)
Consider specific agency variables (e.g., size, values, strategic goals, stage of evolution,
geographical markets)
Recognize and respect the agency’s fiscal reality and the commitment to responsible stewardship
of public tax dollars and customer revenue
Adapt nimbly to changing external (e.g., labor market) and internal circumstances (e.g., fiscal
restraints)
Be reviewed for market competitiveness and legislative/regulatory compliance (local, state, and
federal) on an annual basis

Additionally, the GM/CEO’s performance will be formally assessed on an annual basis.
Further, should the GM/CEO be employed with a term contract, the Board will endeavor to hold
meaningful discussion about extending the term of such contract no later than 18 months prior to the
expiration of the contract’s term.

BACKGROUND
On December 7, 2021, the Board of Directors amended the Board Bylaws. Article VI: Committees of the
Board, Section 1: Standing Committees, states that, “Each year the newly elected Executive Committee
will appoint between five and seven Directors to the other standing committees based upon Director’s
stated interest in serving on standing committees, and the Board will ratify the selections.” The amended
Bylaws also provide that the Chairs and Vice Chairs of the other standing committees will be selected by
the members of the committee.
DISCUSSION
In late December 2023, the Board Office solicited feedback from the Board on which standing
committees each Director was interested in serving in 2024. The Board Office compiled responses from
the individual Directors for the Executive Committee to review during the January 11, 2024 Executive
Committee Meeting.
After review and discussion, the Executive Committee made the following standing committee
appointments:

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Ford, Chief Operations Officer
Fred Worthen, Assistant General Manager, Bus Operations
Erin Vallejos, Senior Manager Contracted Services, Bus Operations
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
Pursuant to § 32-9-119.5(2)(a), C.R.S., RTD operates a system under which up to 58% of the agency’s
vehicular service is provided by qualified private businesses, nonprofit organizations, or local
governments pursuant to competitively negotiated contracts. The agency currently contracts
approximately 45% of fixed-route service, 100% of complementary paratransit service (Access-a-Ride),
and 100% of FlexRide service, for a total amount of contracted transit service of approximately 56%.
The first contract for the provision of contracted fixed-route services was referred to as the “Group 1”
contract, and each subsequent contract was given a higher number. The service contract referred to as
“Group 32” replaces the Group 28 service contract, which will expire on August 24, 2024. The Group
32 service package consists of 116 buses operating 20 routes that provide service to the cities of
Arvada, Aurora, Brighton, Commerce City, Englewood, Glendale, Lakewood, Littleton, Thornton,
Westminster, and Wheat Ridge, the City and County of Broomfield, and the City and County of Denver,
providing approximately 236,786 revenue hours per year.
DISCUSSION
On July 12, 2023, RTD issued a solicitation for the provision of fixed-route service referred to herein as
Group 32 service. The solicitation was made available on the RTD website and was advertised via transit
industry-related publications. Proposals were due September 21, 2023. During the two-month
solicitation period, two proposals were received. A panel of staff subject matter experts assessed the

Packet Pg. 107

18.D

proposals using pre-determined objective evaluative criteria. Based on the overall evaluations of the
proposals, the panel recommends awarding the contract to Transdev Services, Inc.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding is included in the 2024 Budget for the provision of Group 32 services effective August 25,
2024. Funding for future contract years is contemplated in the agency’s financial forecast and will be
presented for the Board’s consideration annually, as identified within each year’s respective budget.

BOARD CHAIR REQUESTED AGENDA ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
2024 General Manager and CEO Performance Assessment
Framework

January 24, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
January 30, 2024

Added to Committee Agenda by the Chair pursuant to RTD Board Bylaws Article VI., Section 1(b).
Requires formal motion and second at Committee meeting.
MOTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt a GM/CEO Performance Assessment Framework for calendar year
2024.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Erik Davidson, Board Chair
Debra A. Johnson, General Manager and CEO
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
During the February 15, 2023, Performance Committee (committee) meeting, committee members
reached a consensus that the processes for evaluating both the performance of the General Manager and
Chief Executive Officer (GM/CEO) and the performance of the agency itself could be enhanced.
In furtherance of this objective, the committee members reviewed the following materials during the
April 12, 2023, meeting:
• The 2021-2026 Strategic Plan adopted by the Board of Directors on August 10, 2021
• The GM/CEO Employment Agreement (contract) entered into on September 29, 2020, as
amended by the Fourth Amendment agreed to on October 26, 2022
• The Compensation Study Report completed by Gallagher dated November 18, 2022
Further, committee members agreed to explore possible strategies and opportunities to enhance the
criteria and process for evaluating the performance both of the agency and of the GM/CEO.
Per the contract, by November 1 each year, Ms. Johnson shall propose any suggested adjustments to
the Weighted Success Outcomes, Organizational Values, or Goals and the proposed distribution between
base salary and incentive compensation of the Compensation Increase for the Board’s consideration.
After consideration of Ms. Johnson’s proposal and consultation with Ms. Johnson, the Board shall adopt
the Weighted Success Outcomes, Organizational Values, or Goals and the proposed distribution between

Packet Pg. 109

18.E

base salary and incentive compensation of the Compensation Increase for the next performance period
by December 31.
To allow additional time for the Board to consider Ms. Johnson’s proposal and engage in further
consultation with Ms. Johnson, on December 4, 2023, the Board adopt a fifth amendment to the
contract to adjust the Board’s annual deadline to adopt the goals and metrics upon which Ms. Johnson
would be evaluated in the coming year from December 31, 2023, to January 31. This timing also allows
newly elected Directors following an election year an opportunity to participate in the goals and metrics
development discussion.
DISCUSSION
In adopting this recommended action, the agency seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan priorities
of Community Value, Customer Excellence, Employee Ownership, and Financial Success, as the
performance of the GM/CEO in a given calendar year reflects the overall successes of the agency over
the same period.
As presented to the Board during the January 9, 2024, Special Board Meeting, the GM/CEO
Performance Assessment Framework is comprised of four performance categories, grouped into shortterm and long-term measurements:
Short-term (Annual) Performance Assessment
• Core/Base Job Performance
• Attainment of three Short-term Goals (see Attachment)
• Demonstration of Agency Values
Long-term Performance Assessment
• Based on Board-adopted Strategic Plan Success Outcomes and Performance Metrics
Short-term Performance
As contemplated in this framework, the GM/CEO’s salary adjustment is predicated upon an annual
performance assessment; for 2024, the GM/CEO’s short-term performance will be measured on a 100point scale:
•
•
•

Exceeds Expectations: 80 to 100 points
Meets Expectations: 50 to 79 points
Does Not Meet Expectations: Less than 50 points

For 2024, the GM/CEO’s performance assessment will be weighted as follows:
•
•

Core/Base Job Performance + Demonstration of Agency Values – 64 points
Attainment of Short-term Goals – 36 points

Long-term Performance

Packet Pg. 110

18.E

Also contemplated in the contract are the award of an Incentive Compensation One-Time Payment and
2% Over-Performance Goal incentive payment, predicated upon the successful achievement of long-term
Board-adopted Strategic Plan Success Outcomes and Performance Metrics. Because the Board, in
collaboration with the GM/CEO will be considering adjustments to the current agency long-term goals in
2024, the GM/CEO will not be eligible to receive any one-time incentive payments for calendar year
2024.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with the Board’s adoption of a GM/CEO Performance Framework;
any one-time incentive payment or base salary adjustment would be subject to the Board’s approval
following the GM/CEO’s annual performance assessment.

Short-term Goals
General Manager and CEO
2024 Performance Period

As contemplated in the “GM/CEO Performance Assessment Framework” (Framework) initially presented to the
Board on Tuesday, January 9, 2024, the attainment of short-term goals related to the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan is
a critical element of the GM/CEO’s annual performance.
Included herein is a summary of the GM/CEO’s three short-term goals for the 2024 performance period, which are
directly tied to the 2023-2024 Strategic Initiatives:
• Back to Basics
• People Power
• Welcoming Transit Environment
The goals were created using the SMART goal-setting methodology, meaning goals that are (S)pecific,
(M)easurable, (A)chievable, (R)elevant, and (T)ime-Bound.
Under the Framework, out of a possible total of 100 Points overall, each goal is assigned a point value as follows:
• Exceeds Expectations: 12 Points
o Surpassed expected or established milestones/targets
• Meets Expectations: 6 Points
o Meets expected or established milestones/targets
• Does Not Meet Expectations: 0 Points
o Minimal progress toward established milestones/targets
During the GM/CEO’s 2024 performance assessment, it is the Board’s responsibility to determine whether and to
what extent the GM/CEO attained each of these goals as related to her overall performance. As written each goal,
if attained, would meet expectations.

Strategic Initiative 1: Back to Basics – RTD strives to enhance the reach and impact of internal communications

and to redouble agency efforts to maintain assets in a state of good repair leveraging sound asset management
principles
Goal: To initiate the light rail replacement plan (50% of goal) by February 29, 2024, for the
replacement of aged rail along the Welton Corridor from 30th and Broadway to 19th Street in Denver
and complete at grade crossing rail reconstruction/replacement at five major
intersections along the corridor in downtown Denver by September 30, 2024 (50% of goal).

Attachment: 2024 GM-CEO Short-term Goals (4875 : 2024 General Manager and CEO Performance Assessment Framework)

We make lives better
through connections.

Background: In 1994, RTD commissioned its first light rail line for revenue service, the central corridor,
Regional Transportation District
1660 Blake Street, Denver CO 80202

rtd-denver.com

Packet Pg. 112

18.E.a

which extends 5.3 miles from Broadway and I-25 Station to 30th and Downing Street in Denver.
Recognizing the rail was installed prior to the opening, it is now more than 30 years old, and due to its age
and de-icing agents used on the downtown street segment, the paved section requires complete
reconstruction.
For purposes of this goal, the rail reconstruction/replacement activities will focus on planning for the entire
project as well as construction related to critical intersections within the Welton Corridor. This construction
will impact not only RTD operations but also vehicular mobility in high-traffic areas, including locations
within Denver’s Central Business District. As such, this work will require extensive coordination with
contractors, stakeholders, and local partners as well as large-scale communication efforts to raise
awareness of the impending work and to relay the necessity of replacing decades-old rail to ensure the
reliability of the system.
As the Board is aware, additional phases of this project will be necessary to complete the necessary rail
reconstructions/replacements, going far beyond recent targeted rail sectional repair activities conducted in
this same area in 2023.
Strategic Initiative 2: People Power – Recognizing the critical importance of its people, the agency’s most important

resource, in achieving the agency’s mission, RTD seeks to vigorously address impediments to recruitment and
retention efforts and to foster a culture of learning and development.
Goal: To create, by June 30, 2024, an employee-centric culture framework that reinforces the
performance and corresponding cultural norms that directly align with the agency’s mission, vision,

period.
Background: In a year-to-year comparison of 2022 to 2023, the agency has seen an increase in the number
of applicants and a decrease in vacancies across core frontline classifications; however, retention of those
newly hired employees is less than desirable as nearly one-fifth of newly hired employees are separating
from the agency within one year.

Code of Conduct violations on agency services and workplaces and, in doing so, to improve community and
employee perception of personal and public security on RTD property and vehicles.

Goal: To vigorously pursue the passage of legislation during the 2024 regular legislative
session regarding enhanced penalties for assaults on transit workers (50% of goal) and, by end of
April 30, 2024, develop a project plan to secure the perimeter of one major operational facility
and implement enhancements by November 1, 2024 (50% of goal).
Background: In the 2023 Employee Ownership Survey 45% of those employees’ survey agreed or strongly
agreed that “I feel that I am safe from crime in the work environment.” Hence, that translates to most
employees including represented and non-represented alike feeling that they will be a victim of crime while
performing their job duties at an RTD facility or on a vehicle.
Noting that that adoption and enactment of legislation is within the purview of Colorado General Assembly
and the Governor, respectively, to meet expectations regarding the first portion of this goal, the GM/CEO
will demonstrate concrete steps taken to advocate on behalf of transit workers in order to positively
influence the legislative decision-making process.
For purposes of the portion of this goal related to perimeter enhancements, “major operational facility”
means one of the agency’s divisional locations from which revenue services are deployed and/or vehicles
are maintained, e.g., the Elati Light Rail Division located in Englewood and the East Metro (Bus) Division
located in Aurora. “Major operational facility” does not include administrative facilities, such as the Blake
Street Offices, or transit stations/mobility hubs, such as Denver Union Station.

BOARD CHAIR REQUESTED AGENDA ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Seventh Amendment to GM/CEO Employment Agreement

January 24, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
January 30, 2024

Added to Committee Agenda by the Chair pursuant to RTD Board Bylaws Article VI., Section 1(b).
Requires formal motion and second at Committee meeting.
MOTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt a Seventh Amendment to the Employment Agreement with General
Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) Debra A. Johnson to establish the 2024 pay-for-performance framework
consistent with the Board-adopted GM/CEO Compensation Philosophy.

BACKGROUND
On September 29, 2020, the Board and Ms. Johnson entered into an employment agreement (contract),
and subsequently the parties executed five amendments thereto. A proposed sixth amendment was
approved by the Performance Committee on January 17, 2024, for the Board’s consideration on January
30, 2024.
On September 26, 2023, the Board adopted the attached GM/CEO Compensation Philosophy
establishing nine principles to guide the components of the GM/CEO’s total compensation. As relevant to
this action, under these principles, total compensation will be designed to:
•

•
•

Demonstrate internal equity, fairness, and transparency while being externally market
competitive, aligned to the 50th percentile of comparable public transit agencies, and related
public and private sectors where executive talent may reside
Comprise a component of pay-for-performance designed to motivate and incent performance and
retention
Be reviewed for market competitiveness and legislative/regulatory compliance (local, state, and
federal) on an annual basis

Under the contract and Compensation Philosophy, the GM/CEO’s performance will be formally assessed
on an annual basis.
DISCUSSION
Consistent with the Board-adopted GM/CEO Compensation Philosophy and 2024 Performance
Assessment Framework, it is recommended that the Board adopt a seventh amendment to the contract
to:

•

Establish the 2024 pay-for-performance assessment point distribution and corresponding
Adjusted Base Salary (ABS) increase range for which the GM/CEO is eligible
Require the Board to conduct a total compensation study (Study) and take appropriate action by
October 31, 2024
Eliminate the automatic uncapped annual Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA), contingent on the
Board’s completion of Study and action

The proposed 2024 pay-for-performance point distribution and corresponding ABS range is as follows:

50-79 points
80-100 points

3.25-5.99%
6.00-7.00%

To support data-driven decisions and assess market competitiveness, the Board will retain an external
consultant to conduct the Study and then review and act upon the Study consistent with the
Compensation Philosophy no later than October 31, 2024. Should the Board not take such actions, the
GM/CEO will receive the automatic COLA as provided by the contract in an amount not to exceed 5%.
Additionally, the GM/CEO remains eligible to receive the above pay for performance irrespective of
whether the COLA is applied.
The form of the attached proposed seventh amendment incorporates the sixth amendment and may
need to be adjusted should the Board not approve it.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with this Recommended Action. Any potential Adjusted Base
Salary increase would be recognized following Board action on the 2024 GM/CEO performance
assessment.

Amendment of Article III. (a) of the Original Agreement. Article III. (a) is
hereby replaced with the following:
As compensation to Ms. Johnson for the services to be rendered to RTD during the term of
the Agreement, she shall be paid an annual base salary of Three Hundred Fifteen Thousand
Dollars ($315,000.00) ("Base Salary"), beginning on the 9th day of November, 2020,
payable in accordance with RTD's regular payroll procedures, and subject to such payroll
deductions and withholdings as are required by law or authorized by Ms. Johnson.
Following the annual performance evaluations outlined in Article III (b), Ms. Johnson shall
be eligible for an “Adjusted Base Salary” and “Incentive Compensation One-Time
Payment” as set forth in Exhibit B to this Agreement. In order to set Ms. Johnson’s
Adjusted Base Salary and Incentive Compensation One-Time Payment for performance
periods beginning January 1, 2023, RTD will engage a third party by competitive
solicitation to conduct a compensation and benchmarking analysis (“Compensation
Analysis”). Consistent with the Compensation Analysis, effective November 9, 2023, the

consultation with Ms. Johnson based on the Compensation Analysis (“Compensation
Increase”), of which the distribution between base salary and incentive compensation may

payment. For the performance period beginning January 1, 2024, Ms. Johnson shall be
eligible for an increase to the Adjusted Base Salary as set forth in Exhibit D (“2024 Payfor-Performance”). The Board shall retain an external consultant to conduct a total
compensation study (“Total Compensation Study”) and take appropriate action

Compensation Study findings and recommendations, review of the applicability of the
Compensation Philosophy principles, consideration of any information provided by Ms.
Johnson, and consultation with Ms. Johnson prior to the Board taking any action. Such
review and action does not require the Board to adopt any Adjusted Base Salary or other

Compensation Philosophy for the GM/CEO

RTD’s mission to make lives better through connections and vision to be the trusted transit leader in
mobility, delivering excellence, and value to our customers and community requires the expertise of a
highly skilled and seasoned executive capable of leading and inspiring an innovative, complex, and
unique multi‐modal transit agency.
An overarching goal of the Board of Directors is to attract, motivate and retain the requisite executive
talent necessary to achieve the agency’s mission and vision. The Board further acknowledges that
competition to attract a GM/CEO with the required suite of competencies, knowledge, and experience
is extremely challenging given the highly specialized transit environment. Therefore, RTD must be market
competitive on a Northern American scale in both public and private sectors when considering talent
acquisition and retention.
Furthermore, the following principles will guide the components of the GM/CEO’s total compensation.
Total compensation will be designed to:












Demonstrate internal equity, fairness, and transparency while being externally market
competitive, aligned to the 50th percentile of comparable public transit agencies, and related
public and private sectors where executive talent may reside
Comprise a component of pay‐for‐performance designed to motivate and incent performance
and retention
Incent agency, team, and individual performance aligned to the agency’s strategic objectives and
directly linked to a pay‐for‐performance framework
Provide appropriate opportunities for personal and professional development
Recognize the value in compensation components that directly support the health and welfare
of the GM/CEO today (e.g., health [including dedicated executive health benefits], dental, vision,
PTO, executive leave) and into the future (e.g., deferred compensation, retiree health benefits)
Consider specific agency variables (e.g., size, values, strategic goals, stage of evolution,
geographical markets)
Recognize and respect the agency’s fiscal reality and the commitment to responsible stewardship
of public tax dollars and customer revenue
Adapt nimbly to changing external (e.g., labor market) and internal circumstances (e.g., fiscal
restraints)
Be reviewed for market competitiveness and legislative/regulatory compliance (local, state, and
federal) on an annual basis

Additionally, the GM/CEO’s performance will be formally assessed on an annual basis.
Further, should the GM/CEO be employed with a term contract, the Board will endeavor to hold
meaningful discussion about extending the term of such contract no later than 18 months prior to the
expiration of the contract’s term.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Bylaw Change to Create Annual Committee Work Plans

January 24, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
January 30, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board to amend the Bylaws to add Article VI (Committees of the Board), Section 4 (Work Plans)
to create annual work plans for each Standing Committee.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Jack Kroll, Executive Manager of the Board Office
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 Minutes
BACKGROUND
At the Study Session on October 18, 2023, the Board of Directors discussed the idea of annual
committee work plans. At the conclusion of the discussion on October 18, 2023, the Board provided
consensus guidance to Board Office staff to develop a formal discussion item for a Bylaw amendment
that would broadly define the process for creating and approving annual committee work plans. As such,
a draft Bylaw change was presented at the November 2023 meetings of the Executive Committee and
Full Board, where Directors had the opportunity to provide input.
Annual committee work plans are a useful tool for ensuring the Board and staff collaborate effectively to
accomplish the necessary work of the agency and Board, while providing dedicated space for the Board
to pursue governance/policy objectives and gain further insights into matters of interest to Directors.
Work plans elevate and respect the role of the committees of the Board as some of the most effective
forums for completing the work of the Board.
Each standing committee of the Board has begun discussions on their 2024 Committee work plans.
Should this item be approved, the committees would then vote on their work plans during their next
regular scheduled committee meeting. And those work plans would be then offered to the full board for
review at the subsequent regularly scheduled full board meeting.
INFORMATION ON PROPOSED BYLAW CHANGE
If passed with 10 or more votes, the language below will be added to the Board’s Bylaws in Article VI as
a new Section 4.
Each standing and ad hoc committee must create, approve and forward to the full board for
review an annual work plan detailing the major issues the committee will consider throughout the
fiscal year. The work plan shall be developed in collaboration between the respective committee’s

Packet Pg. 149

18.G

chair, vice chair, and the responsible RTD staff with the input of the committee’s members. The
work plan must be created and approved by the committee no later than March of each year.
Work plans for standing committees may, for purposes of ensuring the continuity of a standing
committee’s work, extend through February of the following fiscal year. Adjustments and
additions to the work plan can be made by the committee chair in consultation with the
committee vice chair and responsible RTD staff.
While leaving space for matters that may arise through the course of a year, a good work plan will
outline what Discussion Items will be discussed and when, as well as what Recommended Actions will
be taken and when. Additionally, work plans should provide staff/administration greater ability to plan
for and respond to Director requests. Directors should utilize work plans as guiding documents in their
endeavors to maximize the Board’s focus and minimize the amount of staff time spent on topics with
little consensus support. A committee should revisit its work plan regularly.
This discussion aligns with the Strategic Priorities of Community Value, Customer Excellence, Employee
Ownership, and Financial Success, as the Board’s ability to effectively govern directly impacts the
overall performance of the agency.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
None.

PREAMBLE

The Regional Transportation District (“RTD” or the “District”) was created
by the Regional Transportation District Act, § 32-9-101 et seq., C.R.S. (the “RTD
Act”) (Senate Bill 309, Sessions Law of Colorado, 47th General Assembly, First
Regular Session, 1969). The District is a

political subdivision of the State of

Colorado, with those powers specifically granted and those reasonably implied from
the RTD Act and necessary or proper to carry out the objects and purposes of the
District.

The authority of the Board of Directors to adopt these Bylaws is expressly
conferred by the RTD Act, at § 32-9-114 (1) (b), C.R.S. Some rules governing the
internal affairs of the Board of Directors are contained in the RTD Act, while others
are contained in other laws and others, by delegation, are to be established by the
Board. For convenience of reference, those that are contained in the RTD Act or
other laws, together with those that are adopted under delegated authority, are
combined in these Bylaws. Nothing contained in these Bylaws, nor any omission from
them, shall be construed as an alteration or deviation from any grant of power, duty,
or responsibility to, or any limitation or restriction imposed upon the Board under the
RTD Act or other applicable laws as they now exist or may be amended.

PREAMBLE

The Regional Transportation District (“RTD” or the “District”) was created
by the Regional Transportation District Act, § 32-9-101 et seq., C.R.S. (the “RTD
Act”) (Senate Bill 309, Sessions Law of Colorado, 47th General Assembly, First
Regular Session, 1969). The District is a

political subdivision of the State of

Colorado, with those powers specifically granted and those reasonably implied from
the RTD Act and necessary or proper to carry out the objects and purposes of the
District.

The authority of the Board of Directors to adopt these Bylaws is expressly
conferred by the RTD Act, at § 32-9-114 (1) (b), C.R.S. Some rules governing the
internal affairs of the Board of Directors are contained in the RTD Act, while others
are contained in other laws and others, by delegation, are to be established by the
Board. For convenience of reference, those that are contained in the RTD Act or
other laws, together with those that are adopted under delegated authority, are
combined in these Bylaws. Nothing contained in these Bylaws, nor any omission from
them, shall be construed as an alteration or deviation from any grant of power, duty,
or responsibility to, or any limitation or restriction imposed upon the Board under the
RTD Act or other applicable laws as they now exist or may be amended.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Bylaw Change to Set a Time Limit on Board and
Committee Meetings

January 24, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
January 30, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to amend Article IV (Meetings), Section 8 (Recesses and Adjournments), to
set a limit on the length of meetings of the Board and its committees.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Jack Kroll, Executive Manager of the Board Office
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
At the July 2023 Executive Committee meeting, the Committee discussed the merits of setting a limit or
fixed end time on meetings. There was consensus that the idea was worth further exploration and
strong consideration. The Board Office and Directors have conducted research looking to other Colorado
local governmental entities on practices around setting limits on the length of Board meetings.
Additionally, the Board Office has sought input from internal stakeholders on the topic of limiting the
length of Board meetings. Based on the consensus reached at the July 2023 Executive Committee
meeting, the research since conducted, and the input received, a proposed Bylaw change was presented
as a discussion item at the September 2023 Executive Committee meeting.
Following feedback received at the September 2023 Executive Committee Meeting a revised proposed
Bylaw change was circulated to the full Board. The full Board discussed this the proposed change at the
October 2023 Governance Study Session and there was consensus to move the item forward as a
Recommended Action. The change is now coming before the Executive Committee and the full Board as
a Recommended Action.
INFORMATION ON PROPOSED BYLAW CHANGE
All Bylaw amendments require 10 votes to be approved.
The change below is proposed to Article IV (Meetings), Section 8 (Recesses and Adjournments)
Once four hours have elapsed following the call to order of a meeting, all regular, special and
committee meetings of the Board of Directors shall be adjourned at the conclusion of the agenda
item under consideration, unless the Board votes to extend the meeting’s length. A meeting may
be extended by a majority vote of present and voting members. A motion to extend a meeting
may (or may not) state a time when the meeting will conclude. If such a time is set, a motion
may be made, and a majority of the board may pass an additional motion to extend. Any

Packet Pg. 232

18.H

remaining action and discussion items on the agenda at the time of adjournment will
automatically carry forward to the next meeting of the Board or respective committee or to a time
set by a majority of the Board.
This proposed change, if adopted, aligns with the Strategic Priorities of Community Value and Customer
Excellence by expanding the level of public access provided to Board meetings. Further, if adopted, this
proposed Bylaw update aligns with the Strategic Priority of Employee Ownership by affording the Board
Office staff and staff who attend regularly the meetings of the Board a greater ability to plan for their
commitments. And, lastly, if adopted, this change would impact the Strategic Priority of Financial
Success, by potentially reducing the costs associated with hosting and producing meetings.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Capping the length of Board and Committee meetings could reduce costs for staff overtime,
interpretation, and translation services.

Fort Collins, CO City Council
Every regular Council meeting will end no later than midnight, except that: (1) any item of business
commenced before midnight may be concluded before the meeting is adjourned and (2) the Council may, at
any time prior to adjournment, by majority vote, extend a meeting beyond midnight for the purpose of
considering additional items of business. Any matter that has been commenced and is still pending at the
conclusion of the Council meeting, and all matters scheduled for consideration at the meeting that have not yet
been considered by the Council, will be deemed continued to the next regular Council meeting, unless Council
determines otherwise.

Golden, CO City Council
All meetings shall adjourn no later than 10 p.m., or as soon thereafter as the hour may be brought to the
attention of the chair, except that upon a majority vote of those councilors present meeting, such meeting may
be extended to 10:30 p.m. Meetings may be extended past 10:30 p.m. only upon the adoption of a motion to
suspend the rules, which requires a majority vote of all councilors. The vote on any such suspension shall be
entered upon the record. When making a motion to suspend the rules, the councilor shall specify the rule or
part thereof to be suspended and the purpose for such suspension.

Boulder, CO City Council
The council's goal is that all meetings be adjourned by 10:30 p.m. An agenda check will be conducted at or
about 9:00 p.m., and no later than at the end of the first item finished after 9:00 p.m. Generally, absent a
deadline which the council cannot affect, no new substantial item will be addressed after 10:30 p.m. At the
9:00 p.m. agenda check council will make a realistic assessment of the items remaining on the agenda.
Council will table and ask the Council Agenda Committee to reschedule any item that council members
reasonably believe will prevent adjournment by 10:30 p.m. The Debrief is not a substantial item. No new
item shall be introduced after 10:30 p.m. unless a majority of the council members in attendance at that
time agree. All council meetings shall be adjourned at or before 11:00 p.m., unless the meeting is extended
by a vote of two-thirds of the council members present. Council shall attempt to schedule any matter not
heard before adjournment as the first item at the next study session. If necessary, the council shall schedule
a special meeting to coincide with the scheduled study session. It is assumed that council will reschedule
items previously scheduled for the study session to accommodate any newly added items.

Longmont, CO City Council
In order to facilitate the convenience of the public and Council, whenever practicable, it shall be the policy of
Council to adjourn at 11:00 P.M., and that items not under present consideration be continued and not be called for
consideration after such hour.

The Regional Transportation District (“RTD” or the “District”) was created
by the Regional Transportation District Act, § 32-9-101 et seq., C.R.S. (the “RTD
Act”) (Senate Bill 309, Sessions Law of Colorado, 47th General Assembly, First
Regular Session, 1969). The District is a

political subdivision of the State of

Colorado, with those powers specifically granted and those reasonably implied from
the RTD Act and necessary or proper to carry out the objects and purposes of the
District.

The authority of the Board of Directors to adopt these Bylaws is expressly
conferred by the RTD Act, at § 32-9-114 (1) (b), C.R.S. Some rules governing the
internal affairs of the Board of Directors are contained in the RTD Act, while others
are contained in other laws and others, by delegation, are to be established by the
Board. For convenience of reference, those that are contained in the RTD Act or
other laws, together with those that are adopted under delegated authority, are
combined in these Bylaws. Nothing contained in these Bylaws, nor any omission from
them, shall be construed as an alteration or deviation from any grant of power, duty,
or responsibility to, or any limitation or restriction imposed upon the Board under the
RTD Act or other applicable laws as they now exist or may be amended.

PREAMBLE

The Regional Transportation District (“RTD” or the “District”) was created
by the Regional Transportation District Act, § 32-9-101 et seq., C.R.S. (the “RTD
Act”) (Senate Bill 309, Sessions Law of Colorado, 47th General Assembly, First
Regular Session, 1969). The District is a

political subdivision of the State of

Colorado, with those powers specifically granted and those reasonably implied from
the RTD Act and necessary or proper to carry out the objects and purposes of the
District.

The authority of the Board of Directors to adopt these Bylaws is expressly
conferred by the RTD Act, at § 32-9-114 (1) (b), C.R.S. Some rules governing the
internal affairs of the Board of Directors are contained in the RTD Act, while others
are contained in other laws and others, by delegation, are to be established by the
Board. For convenience of reference, those that are contained in the RTD Act or
other laws, together with those that are adopted under delegated authority, are
combined in these Bylaws. Nothing contained in these Bylaws, nor any omission from
them, shall be construed as an alteration or deviation from any grant of power, duty,
or responsibility to, or any limitation or restriction imposed upon the Board under the
RTD Act or other applicable laws as they now exist or may be amended.

Committee Meeting Date:
Board and Committee Meeting Accessibility Policy
Consideration

January 24, 2024

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Gabe Christie, ADA Manager, Civil Rights Division
Carl Green Jr., Director, Civil Rights Division
Jack Kroll, Executive Manager, Board Office
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD complies with Titles II and III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), which prevent
discrimination based on disability, as well as Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits
discrimination on race, color, and national origin (including language proficiency). These federal laws and
regulatory compliance requirements establish provisions for language access as well as auxiliary aids and
services to ensure meaningful public involvement by persons with disabilities and linguistically diverse
communities. This is of relevance with respect to the meetings of the Board of Directors (Board).
To ensure compliance, all Board meeting agendas are published with the following language:
The following communication assistance is available for public meetings:
Language Interpreters
Sign-language Interpreters
Assisted listening devices
Documents in alternative formats and language translations
Please notify RTD of the communication assistance you require at least 48 business hours in
advance of a RTD meeting you wish to attend by calling 303.299.2307
Currently, the Board Office works closely with the Civil Rights Division to arrange for any requested
language assistance services. The last meeting during which interpretation services were provided was
the June 2023 Board Meeting, prior to which meeting the Board Office received a request to provide
Spanish language interpretation.
A centralized agency-wide budget has been established to pay for the cost of language assistance
service providers within the Civil Rights Division, and the Board Office coordinates with the Civil Rights
Division to have appropriately submitted any language assistance requests for Board meetings received
by the Board Office.

Packet Pg. 318

19.1

Board meetings are in compliance with Titles II and III of the ADA, and the Board Office has fulfilled
requests for Communication Access Realtime Transcription (CART) services to be provided at recent
Board and Committee meetings, in Q4 2023 and Q1 2024, and has paid for those services from the
Board Office operational budget. Additionally, the Board Office has made coordinated investments from
the Board Office budget into information technology hardware, third-party service providers, and
audio/visual (AV) equipment in Board meeting spaces to ensure greater baseline levels of public
accessibility at Board meetings.
DISCUSSION
The Board is asked to discuss the merits of setting into Board policy the base-line level of accessibility
services it wishes to automatically provide at certain meetings of the Board as well as clearly delineate
for which Board meetings the cost of such services will be covered by the Board Office’s operational
budget.
Staff proposes two options the Board could take to continue to meet obligations to host accessible
Board meetings under Titles II and III of the ADA and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act:
1. Retain current compliant practices, which are to provide accessibility and language assistance
services upon request, while simultaneously establishing those practices in Board policy

2. Adopt a proactive approach to accessibility and language assistance services, including
designation of presumptive languages, whereby certain enhanced accessibility technologies or
services are adopted as a matter of course (with or without request)
Irrespective of which option is chosen, staff recommends it be passed as a Board policy.
The Board Office and the Civil Rights Division surveyed other transit agencies to gain insights into best
practices for providing CART and Spanish translation services. Capital Metro (Austin, TX), Long Beach
Transit (Long Beach, CA), Jacksonville Transportation Authority (Jacksonville, FL), Kansas City Area
Transit Authority (Kansas City, MO), TriMet (Portland, OR), Utah Transit Authority (Salt Lake City, UT)
all provide translation services upon request. Likewise, the above agencies provide CART services upon
request, except for Long Beach Transit, which constructed its new boardroom with embedded closed
captioning technology.
Likewise, the Board Office and Civil Rights Division reached out to other local governments to
understand the levels of accessibility those entities provide at their meetings. The City and County of
Denver and Commerce City provide language translation and CART services upon request. The City of
Aurora provides Spanish interpreters automatically at the public portion of its city council meetings and
CART services upon request. The Colorado General Assembly provides CART services upon request.
Generally, for those entities providing services upon request, there is a requirement to request the
needed services one to three business days in advance.

Packet Pg. 319

19.1

Finally, it is staff’s recommendation, irrespective of the path the Board chooses, to approach 2024 as a
pilot year to evaluate the impacts of the policy.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The Board Office and Civil Rights Division have sufficient funding allocated for Fiscal Year 2024 to
provide accessibility and language assistance services upon request so long as the volume and nature of
those requests mirror historical averages/anticipated requests.
The Board Office estimates the cost of providing CART services for all anticipated Board and standing
committee meetings in 2024 to be $29,100 ($177 per hour). Likewise, the Civil Rights Division has
estimated the costs of presumptively providing Spanish language interpretation to be $26,700 ($120 per
hour) in 2024.
Should the Board choose to proactively provide and/or increase accessibility services at its full Board and
committee meetings, additional funding sources would need to be identified.
In anticipation of a policy change, the Board Office has taken initial steps to start a procurement process
for CART services. The Civil Rights Division has already concluded a procurement process for language
access service providers based on anticipated needs across the agency.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Station Naming Policy Review

January 24, 2024

STAFF REPRESENTATIVES
Jack Kroll, Executive Manager, Board Office
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 Minutes
BACKGROUND
In 1994, as RTD prepared to open the Central Corridor of its light rail system, the Board of Directors
reviewed staff’s proposed light rail station names. Following a review, the Board adopted a
recommended action to retain staff’s recommended station names, which were selected based on the
cross-streets and geographic locations of the stations. The action to approve station names based on
geographic locations and cross-streets formed the core of RTD’s current naming policy.
In 2003, as RTD contemplated adding additional transfer centers and Park-n-Ride facilities across the
system, the Board passed the Station Spacing and Naming Policy. The policy reaffirmed the 1994 action
to name stations relative to their geographic surroundings and added that station names be
“recognizable to our customers as destinations.” Further, this action provided station names “should be
kept relative short” so as to fit on various signs, maps, and printed materials. Finally, this action also
affirmed the Board’s “prerogative to select alternate names through subsequent Board action.”
In 2011, as RTD continued to open new stations and plan for the expansion of its system via commuter
rail, the Board acted again to update the policies and procedures for naming stations. In this action the
Board stated station names should be set at-least two-years in advance of the opening of a new
line/station, and the cost of changing a station name after that point would be borne by the local
government or stakeholder requesting the name change. The 2011 action also opened the door for RTD
to sell naming rights to a station by way of a contractual agreement. And while no stations have been
sponsored since, the policy does stipulate that should a station be sponsored, “the core station/facility
name must remain as a ‘location identifier’ for the traveling public.”
Throughout the summer and fall of 2023, the Board, individual Directors, and RTD staff received myriad
communications from community leaders, disability rights organizations, and members of the Colorado
General Assembly encouraging the Board and RTD to rename Civic Center Sation in honor of Reverend
Wade Blake and19 wheelchair-bound protestors who came to be known as the Gang of 19.
Rev. Blank was a local pastor and disability rights activist. He and the Gang of 19 are widely credited
with helping to spark a national disability rights movement, which culminated in the passing of the

Packet Pg. 338

19.2

Americans with Disabilities Act in 1990. Wade Blank and the Gang of 19 garnered national attention
when on July 5 to July 6, 1978, the Gang of 19, supported by Rev. Wade Blank, surrounded two RTD
buses near Colfax Avenue and Broadway adjacent to the State Capitol. The protest was part of a
broader push for accessibility and equal treatment of individuals with disabilities. And it was sparked by
a federal court ruling in Denver the week prior favoring RTD’s decision to not equip 250 buses it had
recently ordered with wheelchair lifts. The form of peaceful protest displayed by the Gang of 19 during
their actions in July of 1978, as well as prior and subsequent displays of civil disobedience, provided a
blueprint for disability rights protests across the nation.
Following the protest, RTD began the process of making its buses more accessible and committed to
equipping one-third of its buses with wheelchair lifts. Additionally, on January 10, 1983, at the first ever
meeting of the newly formed, popularly elected RTD Board of Directors, the Board voted 13-1 (with one
Director absent) to overturn the previous position taken by the prior, appointed Board of Directors to
order 89 articulated buses without wheelchair lifts. The action reversed RTD’s prior stance and directed
the bus manufacturer to equip all 89 buses on order with wheelchair lifts. By 1985, RTD had become
the first metropolitan transit system in the country to have its entire local fleet equipped with wheelchair
lifts.
In Denver, there are a number of existing and planned public commemorations for Rev. Blank and the
Gang of 19 including:
This past July, RTD rededicated a plaque in honor of Rev. Blank and the Gang of 19 inside Civic
Center Station
In 2005, to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the ADA, a plaque in honor of Rev. Blank and
the Gang of 19 was installed at the Colorado State Capitol’s Lincoln Veteran Memorial Park,
which is adjacent to the location of the 1978 protest
An art installation outside of the Atlantis Apartments, which opened in 2020, in Denver’s Baker
neighborhood pays homage to the 1978 protest
Meow Wolf’s Convergence Station, which opened in Denver in 2021, contains an art installation
in an old transit bus that calls on visitors to learn more about the Gang of 19
The City and County of Denver is in the planning process to renovate Civic Center Park’s Greek
Amphitheater and surrounding grounds; and as part of that renovation, the City of Denver is
exploring ways to honor Rev. Blank and the Gang of 19 with an installation near the amphitheater
Nationally, the practice of naming stations is to do so as RTD has done previously—that is to name the
station with a primary focus on assisting riders in navigating the geographic area in which the transit
system operates.
There have been a few examples nationally of renaming intercity transit hubs in honor of individuals,
these include the Martin Luther King Jr. Plaza in Toledo, OH, the Wilmington/Joseph R. Biden Railroad
Station in Wilmington, DE, and the Moynihan Train Hall in New York, NY.

Instances of regional/local transit agencies renaming stations after individuals are similarly infrequent.
One instance is LA Metro, which operates the Willowbrook/Rosa Parks station in Los Angeles. Instances
of renaming stations after individuals are very uncommon and, one agency the Board Office surveyed,
Houston Metro, expressly prohibits the practice.
DISCUSSION
The current RTD policy does not prohibit the Board of Directors from renaming any of its stations.
However, the policy does not contemplate how or whether the Board should consider naming a station
in honor of an individual.
Directors are asked to weigh in on the idea of a potential policy change to outline the process by which
an RTD station could be renamed in honor of an individual. If this is a route Directors would like to
pursue, they are then asked to provide input on the specific elements of the policy they would like to see
included in any proposed changes.
Finally, should the Board wish to pursue a change to its station naming policy, it is recommended by
Board Office staff that the Chair ask up to two Board members to work with Board Office staff and key
staff from across the agency to bring back recommendations for consideration in March of 2024.
Directors should discuss the merits of the recommended approach for developing a policy change
proposal, if one is desired, as well as the feasibility of the proposed timeline for receiving
recommendations.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact to changing the Board’s policy on station naming. However, should a station
be renamed, a significant financial impact would likely be incurred. Estimates for such costs would be
included in any renaming proposal.

DISCUSSION
The issue of setting a Board policy for light rail station names was raised at a Rapid
Transit Oversight Co11111ittee. Staff explained that the most common method of naming
stations is after the cross streets where the station is located. This is done because
it gives the customers the exact location to either board or deboard the train, and
makes it easier for customers who are not familiar with the area.
The Committee requested staff to research station naming policies at a few other
transit properties. Portland, Sacramento and San Jose were surveyed. None of the
three cities have an actual Board policy. A summary of the survey follows:
Portland:

Their Consumer Programs Division determines the names of their light rail
stations after receiving input from the public. Their goal is to keep the
station names neutral. Many of their stations are named after cross
streets, but a few have names of historical sites at the station
locations. They do have a Convention Center Station and a Coliseum
Transit Center. They are willing to name stations after individuals if
local donations are given .

Attachment: 1994-05-24 LRT Station Names (4877 : Station Naming Policy Review)

The Rapid Transit Oversight Co11111ittee recommends that the Board of Directors affirm the
policy to name light rail stations according to their geographic location.

San Jose:

Staff made reconrnendations that were given to and passed by the Board of
Directors. The majority of stations are named after cross streets which
makes it easier for the passengers to find the stations. A few stations
are named after historic sites and a couple have joint names such as
Japantown/Ayer (Japantown is the area of the city where the station is,
and Ayer is the name of the street).

The Rapid Transit Oversight Committee agreed unanimously to approve the list of station
names which were chosen based on their proximity to street locations.
ALTERNATIVES
I.

Affirm the policy to name light rail stations according to their geographic
location. This is the recommended action.
Generate a modified or different policy for the naming of light rail stations.
This is not recommended because the geographic location concept is important for
customer ease of system use; and the station signs are already being
manufactured.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact if the reco1TUDended action is taken. If the station names
for the Central Corridor are changed there will be a financial impact because the
station signs are already being manufactured.

Sacramento: The light rail architects named their stations. The names were noticed to
the Board of Directors as an information item only. The majority of
stations are named after cross streets which makes it easier for the
riders, although a couple are named after historic rail station locations.
