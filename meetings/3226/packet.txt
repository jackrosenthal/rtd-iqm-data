BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Internal Audit Function Charter

Committee Meeting Date:
July 13, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
July 20, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the Internal Audit Function Charter.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Debra A. Johnson, General Manager and CEO
Ann Marie Isaac-Heslop, Manager of Internal and IT Audit
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Internal Audit Function is an independent and objective assurance and consulting function that is
guided by a philosophy of adding value to improve the operations of the Regional Transportation District
(RTD). The Internal Audit Function assists RTD in accomplishing its objectives by bringing a systematic
and disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of RTD's governance, risk
management, and internal control.
The Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA), the international professional association for the field of internal
audit, states that the internal audit charter is a critical document that records the agreed-upon purpose,
authority, and responsibility of an organization’s internal audit activity. The charter allows for the board
of directors of an agency, as well as the agency’s chief audit executive (CAE) and its executive
leadership, to have mutual understanding of:
•
•
•
•

Internal audit objectives and responsibilities
The expectations for internal audit activity
The CAE’s functional and administrative reporting lines
The level of authority, including access to records, physical property, and personnel, required for
the internal audit function to perform engagements and fulfill its agreed upon objectives and
responsibilities

DISCUSSION
The Internal Audit Function adheres to a charter promulgated pursuant to the IIA’s International
Professional Practices Framework (IPPF), also referred to as the “Red Book” of the internal auditing
profession. The Internal Audit Function’s charter was last approved by the Board in 2017.
The Office of the State Auditor (OSA), through its 2020-21 performance audit of the Regional
Transportation District’s (RTD) internal audit function, and the Peer Review Panel assembled by the

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

American Public Transportation Association (APTA), through the panel’s formal report in May 2021,
recommended that the internal audit function revise its charter and submit it for approval by the RTD
Board of Directors on an annual basis.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with the Board’s adoption of the Internal Audit Function Charter.

ROLE:
The Internal Audit Function is established by the Board of Directors’ Audit Committee. The Internal Audit
Function’s responsibilities are defined by the Board as part of its oversight role.
PROFESSIONALISM:
The Internal Audit Function adheres to the Institute of Internal Auditors' mandatory guidance including the
Definition of Internal Auditing, the Code of Ethics, and the International Standards for the Professional Practice
of Internal Auditing (Standards). This mandatory guidance constitutes principles of the fundamental
requirements for the professional practice of internal auditing and for evaluating the effectiveness of the Internal
Audit Function’s performance.
The Internal Audit Function adheres to the Institute of Internal Auditors' Practice Advisories, Practice Guides,

the Internal Audit Function’s conformance to the Code of Ethics and the Standards.
AUTHORITY:
The Internal Audit Function, with strict accountability for confidentiality and safeguarding records and
information, is authorized full, free, and unrestricted access to any and all RTD records, physical properties, and
personnel pertinent to carrying out any engagement. All employees must assist the Internal Audit Function in

the Board.
ORGANIZATION:
The CAE reports functionally to the Board and administratively (i.e. day-to-day operations) to the General
Manager and Chief Executive Officer (GM/CEO).
The Board:
• Approves this Internal Audit Function charter
• Approves the risk-based Internal Audit Plan

INTRODUCTION:
The Internal Audit Function is an independent and objective assurance and consulting function that is guided by
a philosophy of adding value to improve the operations of the Regional Transportation District (RTD). The
Internal Audit Function assists RTD in accomplishing its objectives by bringing a systematic and disciplined
approach to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of RTD's governance, risk management, and internal control.

Page 3

1.B.1.a

Internal auditors must not have direct operational responsibility or authority over any of the activities audited.
Accordingly, internal auditors must not implement internal controls, develop procedures, install systems, prepare
records, or engage in any other activity that may impair the internal auditors’ judgment.
Internal auditors must exhibit the highest level of professional objectivity in gathering, evaluating, and
communicating information about the activity or process being examined. Internal auditors must make a
balanced assessment of all the relevant circumstances and not be unduly influenced by their own interests or
by others in forming judgments.
The CAE must confirm to the Board, at least annually, the organizational independence of the Internal Audit
Function.
RESPONSIBILITY:
The scope of the Internal Auditing Function encompasses, but is not limited to, the examination and evaluation
of the adequacy and effectiveness of RTD's governance, risk management, and internal controls, as well as the
quality of performance in carrying out assigned responsibilities to achieve RTD’s stated goals and objectives.
This includes:
• Evaluating risk exposure relating to achievement of RTD’s strategic objectives
• Evaluating the reliability and integrity of information and the means used to identify, measure, classify,
and report such information
• Evaluating the systems established to ensure compliance with those policies, plans, procedures, laws,
and regulations that could have a significant impact on RTD
• Evaluating the means of safeguarding assets and, as appropriate, verifying the existence of such assets
• Evaluating the effectiveness and efficiency with which resources are employed
• Evaluating operations or programs to ascertain whether results are consistent with established objectives
and goals and whether the operations or programs are being carried out as planned
• Monitoring and evaluating governance processes
• Monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of RTD's risk management processes
• Evaluating the quality of performance of external auditors and the degree of coordination with internal
audit
• Performing consulting and advisory services related to governance, risk management, and control as
appropriate for RTD
• Reporting periodically on the Internal Audit Function’s purpose, authority, responsibility, and
performance relative to its plan
• Reporting significant risk exposures and control issues, including fraud risks, governance issues, and
other matters needed or requested by the Board
• Evaluating specific operations at the request of the Board or Executive Leadership, as appropriate
• Manage co-sourcing opportunities to supplement resources, including outside consultants as necessary
• Establishing and maintaining a tracking system for corrective action plans as well as close-out activity
INTERNAL AUDIT PLAN:
At least annually, the CAE must submit to Executive Leadership and the Board an internal audit plan for review
and approval. The internal audit plan consists of a work schedule as well as budget and resource requirements
for the next fiscal/calendar year. The CAE communicates the impact of resource limitations and significant interim
changes to Executive Leadership and the Board.

INDEPENDENCE AND OBJECTIVITY:
The Internal Audit Function must remain free from interference by any party in RTD regarding matters of audit
selection, scope, procedures, frequency, timing, or report content to permit maintenance of a necessary
independent and objective mental attitude.

Page 4

1.B.1.a

REPORTING AND MONITORING:
The CAE prepares and distributes written report upon the conclusion of each internal audit engagement. Internal
audit results must also be communicated to the Board.
The internal audit report may include responses from Executive Leadership and corrective action taken or to be
taken regarding the specific findings and recommendations. Responses from Executive Leadership, whether
included within the original audit report or provided thereafter (i.e. within thirty days) by management of the
audited area, should include a timetable for anticipated completion of action to be taken and an explanation for
any corrective action that will not be implemented.
The Internal Audit Function is responsible for appropriate follow-up on engagement findings and
recommendations. All significant findings remain in an open issues file until cleared.
The CAE periodically reports to Executive Leadership and the Board on the Internal Audit Function’s purpose,
authority, and responsibility, as well as performance relative to its plan. Reporting must also include significant
risk exposures and control issues, including fraud risks, governance issues, and other matters needed or
requested by Executive Leadership and the Board.
QUALITY ASSURANCE AND IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM:
The Internal Audit Function maintains a quality assurance and improvement program that covers all aspects of
the internal audit function. The program includes an evaluation of the Internal Audit Function’s conformance
with the Definition of Internal Auditing and the Standards and an evaluation of whether internal auditors apply
the Code of Ethics. The program also assesses the efficiency and effectiveness of the Internal Audit Function
and identifies opportunities for improvement.
The CAE communicates to Executive Leadership and the Board on the Internal Audit Function’s quality assurance
and improvement program, including results of ongoing internal assessments and external assessments
conducted at least every five years.

The internal audit plan is developed based on a prioritization of the audit universe using a risk-based
methodology, including input of Executive Leadership and the Board. The CAE reviews and adjusts the plan, as
necessary, in response to changes in RTD’s business, risks, operations, programs, systems, and controls. Any
significant deviation from the approved internal audit plan must be communicated to Executive Leadership and
the Board through periodic activity reports.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
2021 Amended Budget

Committee Meeting Date:
July 13, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
July 20, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt Resolution No. ___, Series of 2021 to amend and appropriate funds
to increase the 2021 Amended Budget by $194.6 million to $1,860.7 million.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
Todd Nikkel, Budget Analyst IV
BACKGROUND
RTD may amend its annual budget at any time during the fiscal year, with Board approval. Budget
amendments are requested primarily when new information or unplanned activities arise, since the
Approved Budget appropriation, that require additional funding, reductions to funding or reallocation of
funds to the appropriate projects, accounts and cost centers. RTD’s budgetary controls require Board
appropriation of funding in order to authorize staff to expend those funds for specified needs.
DISCUSSION
The 2021 Adopted Budget was appropriated by the RTD Board in November 2020 prior to knowing
about additional COVID relief grant funding, call-back of laid-off employees, planned June 2021 and
September 2021 service enhancements and several other budgetary impacts that have arisen during the
intervening period to date. This budget amendment will provide the necessary funding to address those
additional needs while also reallocating certain previously-appropriated budget items for correct
application within the budget control framework.
Fiscal Policy Adherence
The RTD Board approved the 2021 Fiscal Policy in October 2020. The following are key components of
the 2021 Fiscal Policy and explanations regarding the extent to which this 2021 Amended Budget
adheres to those requirements:
•

RTD will contract with a third party to provide sales and use tax forecasts: The 2021 Amended
Budget includes the March 2021 sales and use tax forecast from the University of Colorado
Leeds School of Business

•

RTD will develop service changes that are matched to funding capacity using the system-wide
and route-specific productivity measures that have been approved by the Board: The 2021
Amended Budget includes funding for the enhancements to the June 2021 and September 2021
runboards in addition to funding necessary to maintain front-line staffing levels based on direction
from the RTD Board to allow use of up to $30 million per runboard from the $203.4 million
Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act (CRRSAA) grant.

Packet Pg. 11

1.C.1

•

Priority will be given to replacement of existing, backlog and deferred assets before consideration
of new assets: The 2021 Amended Budget provides funding for a limited number of maintenance
and replacement needs that are critical to maintaining safety and compliance.

•

RTD will strive to maintain a fund balance equivalent to 3 months of operating expenses,
excluding depreciation, for unanticipated expenditures and increases in costs as well as to
mitigate service disruptions during economic downturns: The 2021 Amended Budget fund
balance is equivalent to 4.1 months of operating reserves primarily due to one-time COVID relief
grant funding

•

RTD will maintain a minimum net revenue coverage ratio (revenues available for debt service after
subtracting operating expenses) of 1.2 times: The 2021 Amended Budget results in a 1.9 times
revenue coverage ratio primarily due to one-time COVID relief grant funding.

The RTD Board also included the following guidance that is specific to the COVID Pandemic in the 2021
Fiscal Policy that applies to the restoration of funding that may occur and the 2021 Amended Budget
appropriation requests meets these criteria:
•
•
•
•
•

Restore reserves to three months if possible
Do not utilize existing FISA balances
Limit or eliminate use of future FISA rubber tire service contributions
Restore deferred projects related to compliance or safety
Restore service as ridership allows

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Northwest Rail Peak Service Study

Committee Meeting Date:
July 13, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
July 20, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the RTD Board of Directors to authorize the RTD General Manager, or her designee to implement the
transfer of $12,000,000 from the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) to fund the Northwest Rail
Peak Service Study and to enter into all required contracts to complete this Study within the Board
approved project budget.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Henry J. Stopplecamp, Assistant General Manager, Capital Programs
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
In November 2004, voters approved the Regional Transportation District (RTD) FasTracks Plan through a
sales tax increase. The FasTracks Plan is a comprehensive program to construct and operate new rail
lines and improve elements of bus rapid transit (BRT), bus service and park-n-rides throughout the
region. The Northwest Rail (NWR) is a 41-mile segment of the FasTracks Plan. Six miles of the NWR
are in operation as the B-line from Denver to Westminster, and the remaining 35 miles have not been
constructed due to financial constraints.
RTD completed an Environmental Evaluation Study of the NWR in 2010. In 2011 and again in 2013,
RTD and BNSF discussed and prepared plans for the full buildout scenario. This included a double track
scenario from Denver to Longmont. In 2014, RTD conducted the Northwest Area Mobility Study, which
was a joint venture between the jurisdictional stakeholders and RTD to evaluate alternate mobility
options in the northwest region. Funding constraints impeded implementation of the recommendations
from these past studies. In 2016, with the goal to minimize the overall cost, the Peak Service concept
emerged as a community recommendation.
At the RTD Board of Directors Study Session, held on February 9, 2021, the Board was briefed on the
current status of NWR as part of the overall FasTracks program. Since February, several engagement
sessions have been held with jurisdictional stakeholders of the northwest region and multiple
presentations have been made to the RTD Board. As an outcome of the presentations, the RTD Board
supported staff’s recommendation to work with the jurisdictions and develop an operating plan and
budget to provide Peak Service rail service to the corridor.

DISCUSSION
With the Board’s approval of this recommended action, RTD staff supported by jurisdictional
stakeholders will conduct a comprehensive Northwest Rail Peak Service Study that will address different
operational scenarios, viable vehicle technologies, fleet and infrastructure needs, lifecycle costing, risk
and mitigation strategies, operational rights within the BNSF corridor, and independent capital and
operating cost estimates to support Peak Service Operations. The Study will include extensive, robust
community outreach.
All of these critical components will be studied independently and will require separate contracts for
different areas of emphasis including the BNSF. As the immediate next step, RTD and the Northwest Rail
jurisdictional stakeholders are finalizing the Scope of Work (SOW) for the Northwest Rail Planning and
Environmental Linkages (PEL) Study, which is a subset of the overall Study and an agreed upon modeling
and engineering agreement with BNSF. The PEL study will provide an independent assessment of the
projected costs and impacts of implementing the feasibility of the Peak Service operations which will
operate weekday service, with three trips between Longmont and Denver during the morning and three
trips between Denver and Longmont in the evening peak periods.
The proposed Study will support the first phase of the commitment to deliver the Northwest Rail as
outlined in the 2004 FasTracks plan. The proposed Study will consider the potential future integration
of Northwest Rail and Front Range Passenger Rail from Boulder to Longmont. The key areas to be
addressed in the Study are:
•
•
•
•
•

Operating Plans
Preliminary Design
Environmental Impacts – Identification and Mitigation
Identifying Key Agreements
Risk Mitigation

RTD plans to use the Study deliverables as part of future contracts in connection with any property
acquisition, key agreements, and design and construction should funding become available to implement
the NWR Peak Service. The Scope of Work for the PEL Study has been reviewed by the following
stakeholders and they will also participate on the proposal review and evaluation later this year:
•
•

•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Boulder County
City of Arvada
City of Boulder
City and County of Broomfield
City of Longmont
City of Louisville

RTD may enter into separate contracts for, but not limited to:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Mitigating impacts to BNSF
Vehicle technical specifications
Ridership modeling
Operations planning
Staffing support
Other services

RTD has submitted an application for the U.S. Department of Transportation Rebuilding American
Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity (RAISE) grant. RTD is seeking federal funding to match with
local funding to complete the PEL Study. Both Governor Jared Polis and Congressman Joe Neguse as
well as other jurisdictional entities have submitted letters of support for this regional project. The RAISE
grant would reduce the impact on the FISA account drawdown.
It is also recommended that the General Manager, or her designee, be permitted to enter into all required
contracts to support this Study, within the Board approved project budget. RTD staff will follow its
Federal Transit Administration’s approved contract processes and budgeting protocols. The PEL Study
Request for Proposal is scheduled to be advertised Summer 2021 and awarded by the end of the year.
Project status and budget updates will be provided to the Board over the course of the project. The
overall Study is planned to be complete by end of 2023.
FINANCIAL AND OTHER IMPACTS
The NWRL Study is estimated to cost $12,000,000 to be funded by the FasTracks FISA account and
possible RAISE Grant. This budget will include staff and project management time.
