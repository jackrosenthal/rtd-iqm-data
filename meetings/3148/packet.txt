BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

Committee Meeting Date:
January 12, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
January 26, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or her designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into a
Funding Agreement with the City of Boulder to continue to provide RTD financial support for the
operation of the HOP circulator bus service in the commercial areas of the City of Boulder, the University
of Colorado at Boulder and adjacent business and residential areas. This agreement is for calendar year
2021 and is for an amount not to exceed $978,092.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Ford, Chief Operations Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
The City of Boulder has supplemented RTD’s bus service within the City of Boulder by providing
circulator bus service, known as the HOP, since October of 1994. This service provides mobility and
access to the commercial areas of the city, the University of Colorado at Boulder, and adjacent business
and residential developments.
RTD also provides extensive bus service to/from and within the City of Boulder. RTD and the City of
Boulder have worked together to assure that these services are complementary and provide attractive
and effective transit service for people living, visiting, and working in the area. The HOP connects to
many local and regional RTD bus routes as well as with the Downtown Boulder and Boulder Junction at
Depot Square Stations.
Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the HOP operated from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at 10-minute frequencies and
7 p.m. to 10 p.m. at 15-minute frequencies on weekdays; 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at 15-minute frequencies
and 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. at 20-minute frequencies on Saturdays; and 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. at 15-minute
frequencies and 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. at 20-minute frequency on Sundays and holidays. In response to the
COVID-19 pandemic and in alignment with RTD’s reduction in service levels, the HOP service was
changed to a Saturday schedule on weekdays and on actual Saturdays. Since June 2020, the HOP has
averaged approximately 524 boardings per weekday, which is down 80% from 2019 when average
boardings per weekday were 2,572.
In reviewing service hours operated and average ridership since 2011, the average hours operated per
month are trending upward while the average daily boardings are trending downward.

DISCUSSION
RTD shall contribute funding to the City of Boulder to support the operation of the HOP in an amount not
to exceed $978,092 in 2021. Funding for operation of the HOP is at 60% of the funding provided in
2020. The level of financial support for this agreement is determined based on what RTD would expect
to operate the service internally. This allows RTD to continue its partnership with the City of Boulder
while maintaining consistency with RTD’s service levels, accounting for the significant decrease in
ridership, as well as addressing the 2021 budget shortfall.
This Agreement will be for a period of one year. The performance of the HOP will be assessed at the
end of the year in cooperation with the City of Boulder. Performance will be evaluated in terms of RTD’s
service standards. If it appears that the service performance is not in line with similar RTD bus routes,
RTD and the City of Boulder will discuss modifications to the service.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for RTD support of the HOP was included in the approved 2021 budget for a period of one year.
Nothing herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this Agreement.
