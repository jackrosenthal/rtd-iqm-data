## II. May Board Meeting Agenda Review

Chair Hoy briefly reviewed the May 23, 2017 Board Meeting agenda. He asked about the retiree awards, and Barbara McManus, Executive Manager of the Board Office, said that only one retiree had committed to attend the meeting.

General Manager Genova mentioned that he had spoken to Director Lubow about her questions regarding agenda items dealing with service contracts, specifically the contract with Jacobs Engineering. He suggested that Director Lubow may want to pull the Jacobs contract agenda item from Unanimous Consent and place it on the list of Recommended Actions, which would allow her to question how much of the contracts went toward projects taking longer than originally scheduled.

Chair Hoy said he was fine with removing the item from Unanimous Consent and asked whether Director Lubow’s question could be better answered offline.

General Manager Genova stated that Director Lubow wanted the rest of the Board to hear the dollar amount estimate that Henry Stopplecamp, Assistant General Manager of Capital Programs, had put together.

Chair Hoy said he had concerns over the wording from staff on the recommended action regarding the non-profit program. He said the recommendation was worded such that a yes vote would result in a workable action but a no vote would terminate the nonprofit program.

General Manager Genova said that was not the intent.

Chair Hoy acknowledged the intent of the vote but asked how the vote would work if the Board intended to do one thing but the recommended action language stated something different. He read the recommended action language aloud.

General Manager Genova said that the funding for the program already existed in the budget for 2017.

Chair Hoy said that the Board could change the budget and does so frequently.

General Manager Genova clarified that a yes vote would continue the program as it currently existed, with the recently approved restrictions, and that a no vote would roll back those restrictions. He said the Board would have to approve an amendment to change the recommended action language.

Chair Hoy asked whether he was being overly cautions or if others interpreted the recommended action language in the same way.

General Manager Genova agreed with Chair Hoy’s interpretation of the possible outcome of a no vote.

Chair Hoy suggested moving forward with the agenda and having staff amend the language.

Director Deadwyler said she interpreted a no vote as meaning the program needed to be changed and that the Board would have an opportunity to do that.

Chair Hoy said that staff was asking to go forward with the program at the current funding level and to put the restrictions in place.

Director Deadwyler said she did not like the idea of being unable to change the program because the recommended action was merely a courtesy that staff had extended to the Board to tell them what they had already decided to do.

Chair Hoy reiterated that the effect of the recommended action is to keep program funding at $6.8 million and continue the restrictions previously agreed to.

General Manager Genova concurred with Chair Hoy’s interpretation.

Director Deadwyler suggested that the Board should revisit the entire non-profit program to be able to help constituents without bankrupting the agency.

Chair Hoy agreed that a probe would be needed but stated the vote before the Board is a stopgap for 2017, without which the program would run out of money.

Director Menten reiterated that the language of the recommended action would need to be changed to highlight the increases in 2016 and, due to budget constraints, the program would be maintained at the increased level of $6.8 million. She stated that alternative action #3 in the Board Report would be the effect of a no vote.

Director Deadwyler stated again that the entire program needs to be revisited but said that keeping the funding at $6.8 million while that review takes place would be fine.

General Manager Genova stated that the plan Director Deadwyler proposed was what the recommended action would accomplish. He said staff would look more closely at the issue and come back to the Board at a later date.

Director Menten said that the pass program working group is not looking at the nonprofit program.

Chair Hoy said that the two programs are separate items.

General Manager Genova said the two plans were separate but related and that there are stakeholders who are interested in both. He said that it is in the Board’s discretion to operate the programs however they want. He noted that recommendations from the pass program study may affect the non-profit program.

Chair Hoy said that he had a problem with program recipients receiving a 50% discount on top of another 50% discount.

General Manager Genova said that staff had considered removing the second discount as part of the recommended action but refrained from doing so because of the potential for pushback.

Chair Hoy reminded the Executive Committee that certain people are getting on the bus for $.65. He said there would be a spirited discussion on the issue on the following Tuesday. He asked whether the Directors in attendance agreed on the new language for the recommended action, and they concurred. He said the recommended action could not be tabled to a specific date because delaying would drain more money from the program.

General Manager Genova said that the restrictions to the program were in place and that the recommended action merely clarifies the Board’s policy.

Director Walker clarified that the motion language for the recommended action would be changed to incorporate the bulleted restrictions itemized in the Board Report.

General Manager said that staff would put together a replacement action in order to add clarity.

Chair Hoy said that procedurally the motion would be read as it appeared in the Financial Administration and Audit Committee, and then a substitute motion would be made.

Director Menten asked to make the main motion since the action came out of Financial Administration and Audit Committee. She inquired when the language for the substitute motion would be made available.

General Manager Genova said the language could be sent out the following day.

Director Menten said it would be good to send the substitute motion language to the Directors before the Board Meeting.

Ms. McManus said that distributing the motion language on the night of the Board Meeting would cause confusion and offered to send the language out via email.

Director Menten said that Heather McKillop, Chief Financial Officer and Assistant General Manager of Finance and Administration, had mentioned the timekeeping contract item from the previous FA&A meeting had been presented to the Board for the fourth time. She said that she only remembered seeing the recommended action twice.

General Manager said that in his recollection the agency had only looked at changing timekeeping vendors twice. He said the agency had originally planned to keep the original vendor but that plan did work out. He said the agency went out with another type of procurement in order to change to a different vendor.

Ms. McManus said that staff had presented an update to the Board and that perhaps what Ms. McKillop had meant was that information regarding timekeeping vendors had been discussed with the Board on four separate occasions.

Motion:              Director Menten made the motion to approve moving the May 23rd, 2017 Board agenda to the full Board.

Director Walker seconded the motion.

Vote on

Motion:              The motion passed with 4 in favor (Hoy, Deadwyler, Walker, Menten), 0 opposed, and 1 absent (Francone).

## III. Other Matters

General Manager Genova stated that he would be attending a technical meeting with the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) Regional Office via videoconference that day and another meeting at FRA headquarters in Washington the following Monday.

Director Menten indicated that General Manager Genova would be able to report to the Board on his discussions at the May 23rd Board Meeting. She asked the date of the next General Manager’s Quarterly Update.

General Manager Genova said the event had not yet been scheduled but would check with Nate Currey, Senior Manager of Public Relations and Public Information, on the timing.

Director Menten asked whether the video recording capability was functional in conference rooms R, T, & D.

General Manager Genova said that the video functionality is moving ahead and that much of the hardware has been installed.

Ms. McManus said that the components were attached to the network temporarily and that an additional component would still need to be installed.

Director Deadwyler asked when the Board could see the video recordings.

Ms. McManus said no one could see anything yet because the video recording was still in the testing phase. She indicated that additional testing would take place the following Monday and hoped to do a formal test during the upcoming Executive Committee meeting. She said that staff was working on the closed captioning and transcript components of the video project. She said that the video project hinged on the proper operation of a video encoder and how that encoder integrated with the Board’s agenda and minutes software, all of which would be tested on the following Monday.

Director Menten questioned whether the work would take another month.

Ms. McManus said the rollout would depend on how well the testing goes and on certain aspects such as sound and video integration and training of outside vendors. She said that she did not know when the system would be ready but hoped to have an end product before the next Executive Committee.

Director Deadwyler asked to know the total cost.

Ms. McManus said she would put that information together.

Director Walker announced that he had been asked to sit on the APTA nominating committee, which selects the organization’s governing board.

Chair Hoy asked whether the nominating committee would be meeting at its own conference.

Director Walker said that the committee would meet at the APTA Board Member and Board Support Conference. He said that he would not be able to attend the Board Meeting on July 25, 2017, because he would be attending Leadership APTA in Vancouver, British Columbia, starting on July 26, 2017.

General Manager Genova said that RTD would be submitting Lacy Bell as the agency’s applicant.
