Special Board Meeting 1 of 2
[SIDE CONVERSATIONS]
BARBARA MCMANUS: OK, I think we'll get started. We're only-- well, I know we have one
person here, and then.
JEFF WALKER: I was upstairs.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yeah
JEFF WALKER: I haven't seen Director Lewis yet, she's the one-BARBARA MCMANUS: OK. I do have the recorders running. I'm going to ask everybody to be
pretty articulate so that we can capture everything as needed, should we need to go back and
listen, if a Director chooses to go back to listen to everything.
There's two recorders, one on each end. They're running simultaneously. And I'm going to pass it
off to Roger now, first, and then to Chair Rivera-Malpiede. Thank you.
ROGER VESELY: Good morning.
ALL: Good morning.
Good morning.
ROGER VESELY: Oh, thanks for helping out with this, participating in this. This is really
exciting stuff, so.
CLAUDIA FOSKA: Roger, this is a really big room. Can you speak up?
ROGER VESELY: I will speak up. I'm sorry. Exciting things, so I appreciate all your
cooperation with this. Just some reminders before we get underway. The questions that have
been all approved by you.
We'll ask that you read those word for word, so that every candidate does receive the same
question. Follow up questions are absolutely fine, as long as they're related to the question that
was initially asked.
And the only warning I would issue with that is, remember that they are all limited to an hour
and 15 minutes. So I don't want to spend too much time on follow up questions, get to the end of
the interview, and not be able to ask the last question or something like that. So please be
cognizant of that. Yes?

LYNN GUISSINGER: Can we ask follow ups to their introduction? Or I mean, something we
know about their history, or their location?
ROGER VESELY: Absolutely. We want to, the candidate to leave, and we have a good
understanding of who they are.
LYNN GUISSINGER: So when do we ask those if they're not related to a particular question?
ROGER VESELY: So they'll be giving an introductory statement. And at that point, if you have
any questions about, again, they need to be related. Ask those questions.
If we start getting off track, I may jump in and say, we need to get back on track and make sure
that we get back to the interview. All right? All right.
Those of you that have been through interviews, and have conducted interviews in the past, bear
with me. But those of you that haven't, I just wanted to cover-- I'm going to read through a list of
areas that can get people in trouble.
And the one thing that, one of the reasons I'm here is to make sure we don't get into any trouble
as we work through this process.
So if, as you think about follow up questions, or questions after the introduction, please stay
away from any questions regarding to where they live, age, any arrests or convictions. Education,
such as, where did you graduate high school? That perhaps could have some bias and things like
that.
So although they sound pretty innocent, they can always get twisted around and used against us.
So we just want to be careful with that. Family status, we want to make sure-- you know, don't
want to ask questions.
Well, what does your husband think about this, or what does your wife think about this? We just
need to stay away from all of those types of things. Financial status, marital status, even
organizations can sometimes get us into trouble.
For example, to throw out one, let's say that someone is a member of the NRA. Some people
may think that's positive, some people may think it's negative, but it's something that is not
related to the job at all, and we need to stay away from those types of things.
Citizenship, national origin, credit. Disabilities is another one to stay away from. Pregnancy, I
don't know if that would pertain or not. Race, color, religion, sexual identity, orientation, and so
forth. So that's kind of a broad list of taboo subjects, if you will. Yes.
LYNN GUISSINGER: I think I should, might as well say this now. With our first interview,
when you Google Michael, there's some history of expense issues and an early termination, and
some things like that, and I think it's our job to ask those questions. Is that right after the
interview? I mean, right after the introduction?

ROGER VESELY: Yeah, no. I would not ask those questions. Rolf, if you want to jump in on
that, a history of Michael Ford's criminal, I guess, convictions.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
DOUG TISDALE: I didn't know about those.
CLAUDIA FOSKA: That's interesting, yeah.
LYNN GUISSINGER: I mean, we need to-- unless you know something we don't.
ROGER VESELY: Yeah. But quite honestly, there-- and I was in the interview with Michael for
when we first hired him. And we were aware of things that happened-DOUG TISDALE: Point of order. This is an open meeting at this point?
LYNN GUISSINGER: No. Is it an open meeting?
ROGER VESELY: It's technically-DOUG TISDALE: Nobody called for executive session.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Oh. I thought this was an executive session. I apologize.
DOUG TISDALE: That we're in an open meeting, and we're discussing an individual and history
about that individual in an open meeting on tape-LYNN GUISSINGER: I apologize.
DOUG TISDALE: Is horrible. Am I correct?
LYNN GUISSINGER: I thought this was executive session.
ROGER VESELY: That is correct.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: You're correct.
DOUG TISDALE: Thank you.
LYNN GUISSINGER: OK.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I would ask, because we're going to be on a time crunch, if you
could also be our time keeper. Because I know that if we look at an hour and a quarter for each
candidate, if we're getting past that, if you could just-ROGER VESELY: I'll be happy to give a 15 minute warning, if that's--

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: That would be great, just because that way, we could keep
moving forward.
ROGER VESELY: Absolutely.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK.
ROGER VESELY: Yes, sir?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Buzek?
VINCE BUZEK: There may be a candidate in here who had disclosed a prior salary during our
discussions. Can we ask about whether he's firmly committed to maintaining that, or negotiable
on salary? Is that something we can get into with a candidate?
ROGER VESELY: Yeah. My-- I'll look at Rolf for this one, but my thoughts are, we should wait
until the negotiation period following this before we do.
ROLF ASPHAUG: I would agree.
VINCE BUZEK: OK. And second question, follow up, if there's something we know about any
candidate that relates to their performance in a prior position, can we ask them for clarification
on their performance issues?
ROGER VESELY: Clarification, if they bring it up. I wouldn't go poking around information
that you may have on someone. Because again, that creates kind of a bias, if you will. People are
getting questioned on something that others will not be questioned on. It's best to stick to the
interview guide, and the questions that we've agreed to.
PEGGY CATLIN: Can we ask them-JUDY LUBOW: I don't get it, I don't get it.
PEGGY CATLIN: If there's anything you'd like to share with us, or anything you'd like to add?
ROGER VESELY: Absolutely.
PEGGY CATLIN: So that would open up the door for disclosing some of those things.
JUDY LUBOW: That was exactly my question.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Oh, I'm sorry. I was going to say, the other question I'd like to
ask is, would you be OK with us releasing your name if you are a-- as we move forward in the
process.
ROGER VESELY: As a finalist.

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: If you're a finalist.
ROGER VESELY: What I would like to do, if you would agree with this is, I'd like to open up
the session with each candidate, kind of give an overview of what we're going to be covering.
JUDY LUBOW: OK, great.
ROGER VESELY: The time limit, and then my concluding remarks would cover the fact that if
you are selected as a finalist, we are required to release your name.
JUDY LUBOW: So that they know, and we'll know ahead of time if they go, no, I can't do that.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
ROLF ASPHAUG: But they don't have the option to say, I don't want my name released.
VINCE BUZEK: Right, right.
JUDY LUBOW: I have a real issue. I came in a little late, but it seems like we're not supposed to
be bringing up if we know that there may be some unique things to them. We're not supposed to
talk to them about it?
ROGER VESELY: The best thing to do in an interview is to ask everyone the same question,
and ask questions follow up questions that are related to the question.
LYNN GUISSINGER: How can we do our job that way?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah.
SHELLEY COOK: We weren't able to see their backgrounds before we set those questions. So
unless they bring it up, and people are inclined to when it's something negative. You know, how
do we know to probe something, to do our real due diligence in interviewing?
ROLF ASPHAUG: You could ask something like, is there anything that could be perceived as
negative in your background that you'd like to talk about?
KATE WILLIAMS: That's a great question.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Yeah.
ROGER VESELY: OK? And we can-- but let's ask everyone that same question, OK?
LYNN GUISSINGER: And then we can follow up if they-KATE WILLIAMS: Right, then you're on that topic.

PEGGY CATLIN: Should we add that as question nine?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes, we could. I'm OK with that, as long as we can say, do you
have anything positive you'd like to share with us? And then, would you like to-- is there
anything negative you'd like to share?
PEGGY CATLIN: That's not included in your resume.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah, that's not included in your resume. So we could add that
as the ninth question. Yeah.
JUDY LUBOW: It's kind of like a joke if you can't talk about that.
LYNN GUISSINGER: We just need to make sure we get to the end every time.
ROGER VESELY: Yeah, be consistent. That's really the big-- Yes, sir.
NATALIE MENTEN: Would it be to the-- add it to the committee, to add number-- I'm the one
asking the first one.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Right.
NATALIE MENTEN: I can just write down-KATE WILLIAMS: That's what I'm writing right now.
NATALIE MENTEN: The wording.
PEGGY CATLIN: Yeah, let's get the wording down.
DOUG TISDALE: They have already assigned who's going to ask the questions?
ROGER VESELY: Yes, it's my understanding the questions are going to start here and work
their way around. We'll get through the nine questions, and then when we start the next
interview-PEGGY CATLIN: Nine would be me.
ROGER VESELY: The next person will continue on and we'll just circle around.
NATALIE MENTEN: OK, so number nine. Do we need to wordsmith?
PEGGY CATLIN: Yeah.
KATE WILLIAMS: Yeah, let's-- that's Peggy, so.

PEGGY CATLIN: Is there anything that is not included in your resume that you would like to
share with us, that is either positive or negative?
KATE WILLIAMS: Yes.
PEGGY CATLIN: That you would like to disclose.
KATE WILLIAMS: That's public record.
LYNN GUISSINGER: How about, that we should know.
PEGGY CATLIN: That we should know. Yeah, because we don't want to have anything that
could be, could surfaced later.
LYNN GUISSINGER: And what happens if they say no? We follow up?
ROGER VESELY: There we go, and again-KATE WILLIAMS: Or then, that's an evaluation of that statement.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: So that the wording again is, is there anything not in your
resume-PEGGY CATLIN: Not included in your resume.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Or in this discussion.
ROGER VESELY: Yeah.
PEGGY CATLIN: Is there any additional information?
LYNN GUISSINGER: There you go.
JUDY LUBOW: I'm a little confused, which is not unlike me.
ROGER VESELY: We all get there.
JUDY LUBOW: Yeah. But it's like, we need to ask-- are we-- go ahead.
NATALIE MENTEN: Well,
JUDY LUBOW: All right, go ahead.
NATALIE MENTEN: Do we want to keep continuing-TROY WHITMORE: To finish this, yeah.

KATE WILLIAMS: Yeah, let's finish the statement.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Let's do this piece. OK.
KATE WILLIAMS: Peggy, will you read it back to us?
NATALIE MENTEN: Is there anything not included in your resume-PEGGY CATLIN: Or in this discussion.
NATALIE MENTEN: Is there any additional information-LYNN GUISSINGER: I thought any additional information.
DOUG TISDALE: Not included in your resume, comma, either positive or negative, comma-PEGGY CATLIN: Right.
DOUG TISDALE: That you'd like to share with us.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Or just any additional information, positive or negative.
PEGGY CATLIN: Yes.
DOUG TISDALE: I think that's a question mark, actually.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Oh, yeah. OK.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Could you read that again?
DOUG TISDALE: Is there any-PEGGY CATLIN: Let me read it out loud.
DOUG TISDALE: Additional information not included in your resume, and perhaps we should
say, in your application, because some of them had letters-- in your application, comma, that
you'd like to share-- either positive or negative, comma, that you'd like to share with us.
JUDY LUBOW: Or that we should know.
DOUG TISDALE: Or that we should know, maybe that's even better. Yeah, or that we should
know.
PEGGY CATLIN: OK. Let me read this back. Is there any additional information not included in
your resume or application, either positive or negative, that we should know? OK.

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Let's just get to that before, while we still have some time.
JUDY LUBOW: I can't understand why we can't ask them specific questions that we need to
know about them.
KATE WILLIAMS: Because you have to ask that question of everybody.
JUDY LUBOW: Why?
LYNN GUISSINGER: Not if they have a history, I wouldn't think.
JUDY LUBOW: Why? It's crazy.
ROGER VESELY: It's a consistency issue. That's a-JUDY LUBOW: Well, so what?
ROLF ASPHAUG: Let me give you an example.
JUDY LUBOW: How do people hire?
ROLF ASPHAUG: Hypothetical example. There are a lot of situations nowadays where people
bring up arrest records. There are also issues with people of certain backgrounds who tend to be
arrested more than other people, and that's a fact.
And people start focusing on things like that, and it becomes an issue. So that's exactly why we
prefer especially, even just to the general questions, and I strongly recommend that. And
especially, keep in mind, we're talking about hiring for an interim position.
JUDY LUBOW: I get it, but there's something wrong about not pursuing the truth with someone
when we have them here.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: It's an interview-JUDY LUBOW: It's nuts to me.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: It's not a trial.
ROLF ASPHAUG: You've got 15 people.
JUDY LUBOW: It's not a trial-ROLF ASPHAUG: Or 14 people.
JUDY LUBOW: It's not a trial, but I want to know who these people are.

ROLF ASPHAUG: And we're worried the questions might get asked that we can't walk back.
KATE WILLIAMS: That are inappropriate.
ROLF ASPHAUG: You know, and that are just-- that people ask questions all the time in
interviews where there are only two or three interviewers, let alone 13 or 14, where somebody
asks some question which, as well-intended as it might be, comes across completely
inappropriately, and it exposes the district to-LYNN GUISSINGER: So how do we-- I mean, we're under super intense press scrutiny.
ROLF ASPHAUG: Right.
JUDY LUBOW: And if something is in somebody's history, How do we make sure we're doing
our job?
ROLF ASPHAUG: I think that, asking that question for starters, plus their resume, plus the
background checks, plus what do you know about a lot of these candidates, they have pretty
strong background.
JUDY LUBOW: Well, our hands are tied behind our back.
JEFF WALKER: So, my view is that everybody has something in their background that they
probably do not want disclosed to the media.
I think it's a kind of, maybe a redundant question, I'm not sure what the right word is, but I think
it's a question that anybody can say, yeah, there's shit I've done that I don't want known.
But to ask it in a public meeting with the tapes rolling, that's not right. We know people get
convicted all the time. So assuming the worst case scenario, people get convicted all the time of
murder that they did not commit.
So why press the question when we know the answer might-LYNN GUISSINGER: Because they need to explain it to us.
JUDY LUBOW: Yes.
JEFF WALKER: Some things can't be explained that easily. This forum, the people that are
going to be here, they have been vetted.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
JEFF WALKER: They've risen through the ranks, they're known.
PEGGY CATLIN: Like the question, have you stopped beating your wife yet?

JEFF WALKER: And if things come out, there are methods for us to deal with that situation, if
things come out that they did not disclose that are an embarrassment to the agency, that would
prevent them from performing the functions of this job.
I don't think you need to go down that road with anybody who stands in front of this committee
today.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK. Director Buzek.
VINCE BUZEK: Yeah. And Judy, it's not a legal prohibition. It's not a law that says you can't
ask that question. It's a best practice issue. If you want to ask that question, ask the question, but
it's the best practice not to, I think is what I'm hearing.
JUDY LUBOW: I hear you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: And Director Folska.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: This is the first round of interviews, then we have our finalists. You have
a second chance to go back after the background check.
So if we have a discussion this evening of things that are troubling about a particular candidate,
they either won't get to be a finalist, or if they are a finalist, perhaps then we can probe deeper. Is
that-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah. Director Williams.
KATE WILLIAMS: I'm firmly in Director Walker's camp, on top of which, I think there's some
value inherent in seeing what people offer. And if there is a public issue that we are mostly
aware of, and they don't offer that, you know-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: The decision is still ours.
PEGGY CATLIN: I have one idea here, may I?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes. And then this will be the last one, because we're now past
8:00.
PEGGY CATLIN: I'm going to preface question nine by saying, we are striving to be a much
more transparent agency. Is there any additional information not included in your resume?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Great.
KATE WILLIAMS: That's good, thank you. All right. One caveat-JUDY LUBOW: Are these meetings open, our discussion?

CLAUDIA FOLSKA: No, this is executive session.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
JUDY LUBOW: But we interview people, it's also executive session.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes, it is.
JUDY LUBOW: Right.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: But we'll have a public hearing tonight after we complete.
JUDY LUBOW: OK.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes, Director Tisdale.
DOUG TISDALE: Thank you very much, Madam Chair, that leads to my question. Has it been
determined by the board, as opposed to the executive committee, that there, A, will be a public
meeting tonight, and B, that that meeting will then go into executive session to discuss finalists?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: It was sent out, yes. Barbara McManus sent it out yesterday
afternoon after the executive session outlining that very-KATE WILLIAMS: I did get that notice.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: You should have received it.
DOUG TISDALE: Right, I understand that there was a board report. But that's a meeting that
was called by the executive committee for this evening at 6:00 PM. And the discussion being-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: John, we did post the executive committee, an executive session
this afternoon? We did, we did.
LYNN GUISSINGER: I think there was discussion though, about getting some assent about
going ahead with that meeting.
DOUG TISDALE: That was my recollection as well, and I just wanted to give the board the
opportunity to weigh in on that, because I know that the executive committee made that
determination, but the board heard that the first time yesterday afternoon.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: I think we talked about it in executive session last Tuesday night as well,
or before executive session.
NATALIE MENTEN: Are you asking if there's a guarantee that we're going to have that tonight?
Is that what your question is?

DOUG TISDALE: Yes, and that we-NATALIE MENTEN: No, there isn't.
DOUG TISDALE: Will have selection of finalists made tonight.
LYNN GUISSINGER: No, that we want to have the meeting, I think is what he's asking.
PEGGY CATLIN: That could be canceled if we don't-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah, it could be canceled if we don't want to. But we want, we
had to put it on the books so that if we did do it, we were noticed, it was noticed. So we were
really concerned about the notice.
DOUG TISDALE: Right, I understand that. So we took a precautionary step of noticing it, which
I think was very appropriate. The question is, when are we going to make the determination
whether we select finalists tonight?
KATE WILLIAMS: After we're done hearing everybody, I guess.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: So we will, at the conclusion of the interviews, meet as a board
to determine if there are finalists, if there's not finalists. So that will determine the next step. Do
we go into executive session, and then do we go to the open meeting with information?
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Well isn't it a continuation of the executive session that we're currently
going to be in now?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: OK.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK. I'm going to call this now, because we have people waiting.
JEFF WALKER: So when, I have to leave now. I would appreciate the opportunity to weigh in,
so Tuesday when I left the meeting, I thought that there would be an opportunity for me to listen
to the tapes and then weigh in on who I think should be a finalist, or finalists.
If that doesn't happen tonight, that's fine. But if there is an opportunity to delay that vote on who
finalists are tonight, that would be appreciated by me.
SHELLLEY COOK: How about if we contact you and discuss it briefly?
JEFF WALKER: It doesn't, I can't vote, so don't waste your time. But if I can review the tapes,
then that would be awesome.
KATE WILLIAMS: And your opinion matters.

VINCE BUZEK: You absolutely can vote.
JEFF WALKER: I wouldn't feel comfortable, because I wouldn't have heard everybody.
VINCE BUZEK: No, I understand, but you can vote.
LYNN GUISSINGER: What if we were to decide to move everybody forward as a finalist?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I need a motion to go into executive session. Second?
ROLF ASPHAUG: And Chair, for the record, if I could say, the motion is to go into executive
session, pursuant to CRS 246402. paren four to discuss sub paren F1, to discuss personnel
matters.
KATE WILLIAMS Yes, second.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Second. First, second. All in favor.
IN UNISON: Aye.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: All opposed. OK. We are now in executive session.
JOHN MCKAY: Can you give me one minute to stop the tape.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Just as a note.
