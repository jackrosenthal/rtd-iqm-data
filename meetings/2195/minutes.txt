need to be taken after the session.
II.

Nominations for Champion of Transit Awards
Chair Kemp shared that there were nine nominations for the Champion
of Transit award including 4 for current directors. The committee
discussed this and determined this award is not appropriate to be given
to an active Board member. These nominations were withdrawn. The

reserve the integrity of the award.
Directors Kemp and McMullen will comprise the sub-committee to
review the nominations and provide a recommendation for the award.

III.

Update from Metro Mayors Committee Meeting

Director Busck provided an update from the last Metro Mayor
Committee meeting. RTD provided historical information on
FasTracks to the committee. Metro Mayors understands the Board
needs their recommendation in January so this can be included in the
timeline leading to the Board decision.
The Executive committee reiterated the importance of this being a
regional decision and working effectively with the Metro Mayors to
make sure they are a vital link in this process.

IV.

Board Recognition Dinner
The Executive committee discussed options for recognizing Directors
who were leaving the Board at this dinner.

Other Matters
 Director McMullen expressed continued frustration over the
perception of lack of fare enforcement on trains. He shared a couple

Summary of the Executive Committee Meeting held on November 13, 2008, 12:00



of personal examples of watching security guards talking to each
other instead of checking for fare evasion. Director Martinez also
shared that a number of riders seem to know the schedule for the
inspectors and felt they should be varying their pattern. The
Executive Committee asked Cal Marsella to provide a copy of the
policy on what the Wackenhut guards are suppose to be doing and
changing some of their known patterns.
G.M. Evaluation Goals—The Executive Committee discussed the
recommended G.M. Evaluation goals as presented. It was noted that
goal 1: FasTracks Environmental goals omitted a goal for the
Northwest Corridor. Director Martinez also wanted to make sure that
the published schedule for these goals matched with the changes to
the G.M. goals. Director Ruchman requested some communications
in the quarterly newsletters to share with the public some of the
reasons that dates may have changed. Director Martinez wanted the
clarification in goal 2 that states these comprehensive sweeps are in
addition to the regular, weekly checks.
Director Martinez provided an explanation of what the intent was for
goal 5. His understanding was led by the need for more interaction
with ridership, the use of electronic media to pull up information
readily on route changes, etc in a more user friendly way. Similar to
the Obama campaign, users can subscribe to email blasts, etc that
would inform them of more current information as it relates to RTD
transit service. This is meant to complement the printed media but is
also meant to include communication media that helps educate our
public about public transportation. Director Tayer added he would
like to see a best practices forum engaging experts on how best to
utilize our media and marketing department over the internet or
different avenues but to think outside the box. How does RTD best
use the electronic age to communicate its services and expand its
customer services capabilities?
Cal Marsella understood the request and agreed to modify goal 5 as
“General Manager will optimize electronic two-way communications
utilizing RTD web page(s) call center, and other phone, electronic and
Internet capabilities to communicate with RTD customers and will
report to the Board on what has been done. The goal is to increase
such communication by 7 percent above customer contacts in
2008.”

Pending these changes discussed above, the Executive Committee
agreed to move forward with the General Manager’s goals for 2009.
Chair Kemp and the Executive Committee tasked Cal Marsella to
come up with a succession plan within 90 days from the date of the
Executive Committee meeting (11/13/08).
Eminent Domain—Chair Kemp indicated it is the desire of the Board
to be more sensitive to the people even as we follow the laws
pertaining to eminent domain. Director Martinez expressed the desire
to humanize RTD similar to how they are implementing eminent
domain in the East corridor.
Cal Marsella stated he had been thinking about this and has some
recommendations for a process that would help humanize RTD. He
will prepare an outline for the Board.
Executive committee agreed to cancel the November 25 th study
session.

VII.

Resolution on communications on PPP—This resolution had been
tabled at the FasTracks meeting pending an understanding from
Director Chacon on her intent. Executive Committee agreed to ask
Director Chacon to provide clarification to the full board on her intent
and allow them an opportunity to respond.
Director McMullen wanted to know when they would be power
washing the stations, especially Dayton Station which is filthy.
Director Tayer asked if we should have a commodity policy that
provides an intelligent way on when to lock in on copper, steel, fuel,
etc. Can we take advantage of the declining prices? Cal responded
there is no science to this and we are watching the signs daily to
make a determination of when to lock in.
