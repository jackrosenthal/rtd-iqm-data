BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Salaried Trustee Appointment

January 17, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
January 31, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve Resolution No. ______, Series of 2023, replacing Leah Riley, Chief
Administrative Officer, with Charlene Polege, Chief People Officer as Trustee with a term expiring
December 31, 2024, replacing Kent Enwright, Manager, Labor Relations with Adam Barnett, Manager,
Total Rewards as a Trustee with a term expiring December 31, 2023, removing Board member Trustee
positions with the expiration of terms on December 31, 2022 for Directors Catlin and Broom and
extending the December 31, 2022 expired term of Bill Weidenaar, Manager, Technical Services through
December 31, 2024 for the Salaried Employee Defined Benefit Pension Plan (DB plan) and Salaried
Employee Defined Contribution Retirement Plan (DC plan).
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD provides a defined benefit pension plan to non-represented (salaried) employees hired before
January 1, 2008, and a defined contribution retirement plan to salaried employees hired thereafter. Each
plan is currently overseen by a Board of Trustees comprised of four RTD employees, two RTD Board
members and the RTD Chief Financial Officer serving as a permanent Trustee. Employees serving as
Trustees are recommended to the Board by the General Manager and CEO for appointment. Directors
serving as Trustees are appointed by the Board Chair and approved by Board action.
On January 8, 2008, the Board of Directors adopted Resolution No. 001, Series of 2008 (Resolution No.
1), which established a committee composed of the Board Chair, the Chair of the Salaried Employee
Pension Trust Fund, and the Finance Chair (i.e., the Chair of the Finance Administration and Audit
Committee as it existed at that time) to screen applications from prospective pension and DC plan
Trustees from among “the middle management salaried employee class and the senior management
salaried employee class and…[to] bring recommendations back to the Board.”
As a revision to the process established in Resolution No. 001, the Board adopted Resolution No. 27,
Series of 2010, which stated that, “for reappointment of Trustees who have served satisfactorily and in
whose education the Trusts have made substantial investments, it is not necessary to seek applications
for renewal, and instead the application process established by the Board in 2008 would be used on

Packet Pg. 3

1.E.1

those occasions when the Board finds it necessary or appropriate to appoint new salaried Trustees to
the Trusts.”
On May 31, 2016, in Resolution No. 008, Series of 2016 (Resolution No. 008), the Board amended the
Defined Benefit Pension Trust and the Defined Contribution Retirement Trust (Trusts, collectively) to
remove the “senior” and “middle” management distinction established in Resolution No. 001. Instead,
Resolution No. 008 authorized the Board to appoint two employee Trustees who participate in the
pension plan and two who participate in the DC plan, as well as two Directors appointed to the Trusts
and the Chief Financial Officer who is a permanent member of the Trusts, to serve as the same Trustees
on both trusts.
DISCUSSION
In adopting this recommended action, the agency demonstrates its commitment to meet the Strategic
Priorities of Employee Ownership and Financial Success.
This action item seeks Board approval to modify the Trustee composition of these Trusts with the
following:
Replace Trustee Leah Riley, Chief Administrative Officer, with Charlene Polege, Chief People
Officer, as a Trustee with a term expiring December 31, 2024
Replace Trustee Kent Enwright, Manager, Labor Relations, with Adam Barnett, Manager, Total
Rewards, with a term expiring December 31, 2023
Remove Board member Trustee positions from the Trusts with the expiration of Director Catlin’s
and Director Broom’s terms on December 31, 2022
Extend through December 31, 2024, the term of current Trustee Bill Weidenaar, Manager,
Technical Services, that expired on December 31, 2022
No change to current Trustee Bill Sirois, Manager, Transit Oriented Communities, with a term
expiring December 31, 2023
No change to the Chief Financial Officer position as a permanent member
The above actions will result in a body of five RTD staff Trustees with two Trustees being participants in
the closed defined benefit pension plan.
It is recommended to remove, as Trustees, the Board positions established in 2016, in order to focus
Trust governance with employees who participate in and represent staff colleagues participating in these
retirement plans, have expertise in the areas of human resources, health and wellness benefits and
finance as well as separate the day-to-day activities of the Trust from the Board in its capacity as a
policy-making body.
Further, the Trust plan documents will continue to require Board approval for changes in plan design and
annual budget appropriation in addition to any material changes to the plans coming to the Board
through the Audit Committee.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
A Line Naming Rights Opportunity

January 17, 2023

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Stuart Summers, Chief Communications and Engagement Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
When the A Line opened in 2016, RTD entered into a naming rights agreement with the University of
Colorado. Advertising revenues associated with the agreement totaled $1M annually. The original
agreement ended in May 2022.
In fall 2022, the agency once again offered an opportunity to secure the A Line’s name-only assets. The
solicitation closed in November 2022 without RTD having received any proposals due in part to factors
outside of the agency’s control.
DISCUSSION
Exploring additional revenue sources by way of corporate partnerships, including naming rights
agreements, aligns with the agency’s Strategic Priority of Financial Success.
Staff intends to readvertise the opportunity to secure A Line naming rights in the second quarter of
2023. Given the high public visibility of the A Line, its value to the region, and its continued substantial
ridership even at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Communications and Engagement staff will
work with Contracts and Procurement staff to ensure the public solicitation reflects the significant
benefits the A Line naming rights agreement would represent to any interested external entity.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Following a review in 2022, the A Line naming rights opportunity was valued at $1M per year with
advertising included in the scope.
