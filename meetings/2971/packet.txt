Subject:

2020 - 2022 Granite Paver Maintenance
Contract for 16th Street Mall Transitway Lanes

General

Board Meeting Date: February 6, 2020

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his or her designee, to execute all documents necessary to execute
the three-year contract for 16th Street Mall Granite Paver Maintenance with Colorado Custom Rock
Corporation, in the dollar amount of $3,565,821. Funding for the first year of this action is $1,100,000
and is included in the 2020 Adopted Budget.
This recommendation supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #1 - Successful Delivery of Transit Services
Task Goal #3 – Enhance Current and Future Transportation Methods
BACKGROUND
The Free Mall Ride bus service connects Denver Union Station and Civic Center Plaza, and carried
approximately 32,000 passengers per weekday in 2019 on the 16th Street in Downtown Denver
(“Mall”). A portion of the Mall, from Civic Center Plaza to Market Street was built in 1982 with granite
pavers as the surfacing materials. The right-of-way is owned by the City and County of Denver (CCD),
but RTD took on the maintenance of the Transitway pavers in 1984. Under the terms of an existing
inter-governmental agreement (IGA), RTD is required to provide maintenance on the Transitway pavers
until December 31, 2022.
From 2017 through 2019, RTD spent $3,289,549 in direct costs for repairing the Transitway pavers.
Repairing the pavers also includes part time effort of several staff members in addition to the direct cost.
In 2013, CCD committed to participate in the cost of granite paver maintenance and pay RTD 30% of
the annual paver maintenance cost, up to an annual maximum of $300,000, for a period of ten years.
In 2015 and 2016, RTD staff led an environmental clearance effort to evaluate different paving material
alternatives for the Transitway. In 2017, a broader vision for the Mall came under consideration, to
make the Mall a place to go to, in addition to going though. The Downtown Denver Partnership and
CCD are working to make the Mall a destination and a welcoming place for everyone in the heart of a
vibrant downtown. As part of realizing the vision, the transit lanes will be moved towards the center,
and the Mall will be rebuilt with granite paving in a manner that addresses historic problems, such as the
slippery surface, and inadequate drainage, and enhances public life.
Release of the Environmental Assessment (EA) for the reconstruction project for public review, and the
framework for construction and maintenance agreements was approved by the RTD Board on June 26,
2018. A Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) was issued by the Federal Transit Administration
(FTA) on November 26, 2019, thus completing the EA process. RTD is committing the federal funds
from two FTA grants previously awarded to RTD for rehabilitation of the Transitway (provided that FTA

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

approves changes to the scope of those grants), as well as RTD’s 1/3 share of the Local Match to the
grants. The remaining funds for these two grants total $14,802,501, and require a 20% local match.
CCD is proceeding with developing plans, specifications, and a Request for Proposals. CCD intends to
obtain a five year warranty for the transit way from the contractor building the Project. RTD will make
payments of $100,000 each year during the warranty period in to a reserve account and 30% of
incurred maintenance costs thereafter, up to $100,000 per year.
The earliest ground disturbance expected is in the first half of 2021. Construction is expected to last at
least three years.
The construction and maintenance IGAs will need Denver City Council approval.
DISCUSSION
This contract provides granite paver repair, replacement and/or maintenance within the 16th Street Mall
Transitway between Broadway and Market Street. The contract was advertised as a Request for
Proposals (RFP), or best value contract. Proposals were evaluated on Experience of the Firm and Key
Individuals (25%), Understanding/Approach/Organization (25%), and Cost (50%). Colorado Custom
Rock Corporation was deemed responsive and responsible and found to be the best value proposal.
Granite pavers are purchased by RTD on a separate contract with Cold Spring Granite and furnished to
the mall paver maintenance contractor for installation.
The best value proposer is Colorado Custom Rock Corporation for the three-year contract amount of
$3,565,821. The only other firm to propose was PCL Construction with a three year cost of
$6,412,012.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The RTD 2020 Adopted Budget includes $1,100,000 to fund the first year of this contract. Funding for
the remaining two years of the contract will be included in the 2021-2026 Mid-Term Financial Plan.
This Project is funded from local dollars, including the $300,000 annual contribution from the City and
County of Denver.
This is a work order contract, so the actual expenditures will vary depending on the amount of repair
work needed over the term of the contract. These expenditures will decrease after the Mall
reconstruction project begins.
DBE/SBE GOAL
The Small Business Office reviewed the scope of work, and established a zero percent SBE goal, due to
the specialized work involved. Colorado Custom Rock is an SBE firm.
ALTERNATIVES
1 Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs &
FasTracks Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his or her
designee, to execute all documents necessary to execute the three-year contract for 16th Street
Mall Granite Paver Maintenance with Colorado Custom Rock Corporation, in the dollar amount of
$ $3,565,821. Funding for the first year of this action is $1,100,000 and is included in the 2020
Adopted Budget.
2

Do not accept the recommended action. Allow the Transitway pavers to fall into disrepair, which
may lead to trip hazards for pedestrians, and potentially cause damage to the buses. This will

Packet Pg. 4

1.B.1

lead RTD to reroute or discontinue the Free Mall Ride bus service and also violate terms of the
IGA with the CCD.
3

Resolicit the work. This is not recommended as historically we have only had a couple of firms
bid on this work.

Key Peer Findings

Attachment: Reiamgine RTD Update to Board (4094 : Reimagine RTD)

DEVELOPING THE MOBILITY OF THE FUTURE

• RTD is the largest service area and has the lowest population density
of any of the peers. Only half the population density of the next least
dense peer.
• The majority of transit ridership at RTD, like the peer group average,
is carried on bus service.
• RTD provides more service per resident (both bus service and rail
service) than our peers.
• Ridership per revenue hour on rail service is lower than the peer
average and is lower than all peers except San Jose.
• Otherwise RTD is essentially comparable on the other metrics.

The agency moves some 330,000 riders a day in the largest transit service area in
the country. RTD has 50 years under its belt serving the people of the Denver metro
region, but as transportation evolves, RTD is evolving with it. The agency’s Reimagine
RTD initiative aims to evaluate how RTD provides service and how to best position the
agency for the future to connect people to the places they want and need to go.
And not unlike other public agencies in the region, due to economic, demographic, and
lifestyle factors, RTD is also facing some challenges. Workforce shortages, reduced
ridership, challenges with contractors, and budget limitations have impacted public
perception of and trust in the agency. In order to move through this challenging period
and position the agency as “the mobility integrator, innovator, and instigator” for the
region, the Communications Department is focused on repositioning the RTD brand,
building partnerships within the community, engaging riders and non-riders, engaging
employees, being open and transparent with the public, and providing accurate and
timely information to constituents.
This objective can only be achieved when the Communications Department is
functioning optimally. Vacancies in key positions, a lack of focus and collaboration,
and shifting leadership created challenges within the Department. Now, the
Department has a keen focus on streamlining the organizational structure, defining
general department and individual division mission statements, clarifying roles and
responsibilities for each division within the Department, and embracing a team charter
outlining the values and behaviors by which the team will abide.
This document is a 3 - 5 year strategic roadmap for the Department to focus and
prioritize the team’s efforts, and ensure that the Department contributes to meeting the
overarching agency goals and priorities – all in the spirit of communications excellence.

COMMUNICATIONS DEPARTMENT INTENT
The Regional Transportation District (RTD)
Communications Department is one of nine
departments of the agency, each focused on
a specific functional area in implementing the
programs, projects and services of RTD. The
Communications Department directs and carries
out the internal and external communications
for the agency, through its four divisions:
Customer Care; Government Relations; Public
Relations and Engagement; and Marketing.
2019 served as a rebuilding period for the
Communications Department. Years of shifting
direction and changing leadership left the
Department without clear focus or priorities.
In addition, a misaligned organizational
structure created confusion around roles

and responsibilities, and resulted in an environment
lacking accountability.
Upon arrival, of a new Assistant General Manager
of Communications, a new organizational structure
realigned some functions to streamline and
optimize resources. Public Relations and
Engagement encompasses public relations,
community engagement, project outreach,
and internal communications. Marketing has
responsibility over all promotional, customer
information, and sales activities, including
market development, digital marketing, creative
services, event management, market research,
and marketing communications. Government
Relations and Customer Care remained the
same (see Appendix for detail).

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES
The RTD Board of Directors has set the strategic
direction for the agency focused on the pillars of
transparency, fiscal sustainability, safety, reliability,
collaboration, and communication.
Flowing from this framework is RTD’s objective to
also be known as “the mobility integrator, innovator,
and instigator” for the Denver metropolitan region.
To support this goal, the agency has designed and
completed several large-scale commuter and light
rail projects, integrated fixed route bus and bus
rapid transit (BRT) into the RTD system, established
partnerships for first/last mile solutions, and developed
strong relationships with digital integrators like the
Uber, Lyft, and Transit apps.
However, RTD has not received adequate exposure
for the advancements it has made primarily because
of the lack of focused, consistent, integrated
messaging, and an inconsistent approach to
communicating with our key audiences. In addition,
because of the strength of the local economy, low
unemployment, the rapid growth of the Denver
metropolitan area, and the sheer size of our service
area, RTD is experiencing a “paradism shift” that
includes an operator shortage, reduced ridership,
and budget challenges due to declining growth of

sales tax revenues that fund the agency. As a result,
our quality of service has been negatively affected
as well as our reliability and overall image.
To ensure that the RTD Board, riding public, non-riding
public, public officials, transportation agencies (local,
state, federal), and others recognize the strategic
efforts and progress RTD has made and continues
to make for the region, the Communications team
will develop a distinct voice and laser-focused key
messaging geared specifically for and delivered to key
audiences consistently at the right time, in the right
format, and through the right channels. The RTD story
must demonstrate a clear link between the transit
needs of the public and RTD’s current and future
service improvements and mobility plans. This will
require close coordination and collaboration between
all divisions within the Department and the agency,
and the collective focus on a few important objectives.

Attachment: Strategic Communications Plan 1.28.20 (4089 : Communications Update)

The Department determined three strategic priorities
that will accomplish our goal and ultimately support
and promote the overarching priorities of the agency:
1. Refine and enhance the RTD image
2. Foster community partnerships
3. Improve customer information.

that is easy, convenient and
comfortable for people.

STRATEGIC PRIORITIES
STRATEGIC PRIORITY #1:
REFINE AND ENHANCE THE RTD IMAGE
RTD has been in existence for more than 50
years and despite its clear mission “To meet our
constituents’ present and future public transit
needs by providing safe, clean, reliable, courteous,
accessible, and cost-effective service throughout
the District,” the agency has not consistently
communicated with a unique, authentic, and
compelling “brand voice” (the visual and verbal
expression of the brand). As a result, there is no
consensus opinion among our various audiences with
regard to who we are, what we do, how we do it, what
value we offer, and (most importantly) why we exist.
This fragmentation over time has created an identity
crisis of sorts for the agency. The lack of a clear brand
narrative has hampered RTD’s ability to “own” our
story and to tell it in a compelling, convincing, and

authentic way. Consequently, others (news media,
elected officials, government agencies, and the
general public) have told our story for us and many
times, that story is both negative and erroneous.
The Communications Department has an opportunity
to develop a brand framework for telling the RTD story
in a way that allows the agency to “take credit” for the
transformational effect the agency has had on people
and the region as a whole, to highlight the positive
impact that our employees have on our community,
and lay the foundation for garnering support for future
transportation transformation in the region with RTD
as the foundation.

Each division within the Department plays an
important role in this effort.
Packet Pg. 103

2.C.1.c

Develop RTD Brand Standards and Guidelines.
At its core, the RTD brand includes all of the typical
standardized brand elements (logos, imagery,
photography, icons, color palette, typography, etc.),
but also goes further to clearly identify our audiences
(customer demographics), brand values, incorporate
an agency personality, “tone of voice” and writing style
guide, as well as key messaging to communicate how
we deliver on and live our mission, vision, and values
every single day. These brand standards, complete
with executed examples of the brand across our
major materials and platforms, are compiled with
a brand toolkit, including templates of commonly
used materials, for adoption across the agency.
Publish brand standards, templates, assets,
and procedures documentation.
In order for people to embrace and activate the brand
in a consistent fashion, all guidelines, standards, and
assets must be made available and communicated
throughout the agency. Directions and guidelines
must be clear and easy to follow. Therefore, all
standards, resources, templates, and brand elements
will be published on The Hub with directions for
requesting brand support if necessary. Employees can
download brand elements for use; however, they will
need to adhere to the Communications Policy which
outlines the proper rules. Communications personnel,
as the creators, owners, and emissaries of the brand,
will be designated as resources to assist employees
with implementation of standard elements as well as
any special requests.
Establish a Communications Policy.
Developing and implementing a Communications
Policy will ensure proper usage of the brand and the
expertise of the Communications Team. In order for
the agency to ensure that the brand is properly used
and represented, people throughout the agency
must understand the guidelines.
A Communications Policy will help internal team
members understand how to properly use the

brand and help enforce the new standard. This
policy will also clearly outline the Communications
Team as the owner and subject matter expert of
the agency’s communications processes, channels
and materials.
Gain Endorsement of the Brand
Standards and Guidelines.
Once all standards, materials, and resources are
ready for publication, we will secure approval and
endorsement by the General Manager and Senior
Leadership Team, who will champion the standards
throughout the agency. They will disseminate
the policy to their respective teams, with specific
instructions to follow the standards to optimize the
RTD brand and voice.
Activate the Brand Consistently Throughout
All Communications Efforts.
At every touchpoint, the RTD brand will communicate
both visually and verbally, the RTD story. This will
be done through consistent imagery, iconography,
typography, and tone of voice. In other words, we
will represent a standardized look and feel as well as
messaging across all internal and external marketing
and communications materials. This will be readily
apparent in advertising, internal communications,
collateral, web and digital, signage, fare media,
outreach and other activities that carry the RTD
name or represent the agency.
Educate the Agency on the Importance of a
consistent, strong, and streamlined brand.
Our employees are the living embodiment of RTD
with each and every interaction. In order to gain
internal buy in and develop confidence at the staff
level, the RTD Marketing and Internal Communications
Team will, prior to internal roll out, educate staff
agency-wide on the importance of a brand and the
benefits of consistent application. Through roadshows,
articles in the Monday Morning Dispatch, and the
like, we will also educate our employees on our
brand personality, traits, and attributes, so that
they can fully embrace the agency’s unified brand
in all its aspects.

DIGITAL COMMUNICATIONS
The Digital Communications Team will utilize,
execute, and represent the cohesive RTD brand and
message across all digital channels, including the
website, social media channels, RTD and third-party
apps, emails, and other digital platforms. The Digital
Communications Team will continue to adjust the
agency’s social media strategy to reflect the
changing needs for digital content.
Implement Engaging Social Media Campaigns
The social media team will create and deploy
interesting digital campaigns that give perspective
to the projects, programs and issues of the agency
and encourage the public to engage. Providing
a visible vehicle for the public to share comments
aligns with the Board and the staff objective of
being open and transparent.
MARKET RESEARCH
The Market Research Team was critical to informing
the brand evolution, our personality, and attributes
through key customer insights gained through
qualitative and quantitative research. The group will
continue to monitor fluctuations that might impact our
brand narrative, customer demographics, or other
key aspects that will enable us to further solidify our
messaging and improve our impact.

SPECIAL EVENTS
Through planning and execution of internal and
external events that are on brand, message, and
consistent with our community commitment, the
RTD Special Events Team will help to reinforce
all attributes of the RTD image across the various
communities that we serve. The team will also play
a critical support role in any activities across the
agency that require event or outreach support via its
RTD Ambassadors program, wherein each individual
will be well versed in the evolved image, brand, and
message, and will easily be able to communicate it
effectively across
our communities.

PUBLIC RELATIONS AND ENGAGEMENT

Our public relations, engagement and project
outreach teams will proactively tell the RTD story
and rebuild the RTD image with the news media
and key stakeholders, speaking in one unified
voice with corresponding visuals. The outreach and
engagement teams will speak directly to members
of our communities and special interest groups,
working with and through them on an ongoing
basis to develop relationships based on RTD’s
authentic narrative. Each team will also benefit from
a standardized set of templates, images, and other
resources readily available to their specific audiences.

MARKET DEVELOPMENT
The Market Development Team will represent the
RTD image through frequent contact and long-term
relationships with specialized clients (businesses,
schools, communities, nonprofits etc.). These
interactions will offer opportunities to not only
convey the true RTD story, but also to reinforce
interactions and rebuild consumer confidence
across multiple channels.

GOVERNMENT RELATIONS

Explore New Ridership Programs
Staff will explore ridership programs that target
certain sectors of the community. Examples include
programs to benefit leisure riders, visitors staying
at downtown hotels and riders using RTD to meet
people for social outings.

Our Customer Care team will demonstrate our
brand image and customer focus on every interaction
with both internal and external customers through
the Telephone Information Center, Digital Customer
Relations, RTD Sales Outlets, and the Division
Customer Care Liaisons.

Our government relations team will serve as the
liaison between our elected officials and RTD. They
will help to communicate the authentic RTD story and
overarching goals of the agency on the local, state,
and federal agencies. In addition, the Government
Relations Officer will assist in educating elected
officials to enhance RTD’s image.

PRIORITY #1 METRICS
In order to measure the success and impact on RTD’s image and brand, the team will
first establish a benchmark against which we can measure. This will be determined
through evaluation of recent customer satisfaction surveys, internal employee surveys,
and a specific brand-focused survey that will be conducted in the first quarter of 2020.
Additionally, Meltwater (RTD’s media clips service) and News Stop analytics will help
determine if perception has changed. From this assessment, we will then determine our
focus and areas of opportunity as well as the activities that we feel will have a positive
effect on the agency.
Some metrics that will help us track our success and effectiveness include:

• Number of positive news stories
• Number of impressions for stories posted on the News Stop
• Rider perception via surveys
• Public’s perception via surveys and focus groups
• Employees’ perception via surveys and focus groups
• Social media
• Posts
		• Total net follower growth
umber of engagements (e.g., total reactions,
		• N
comments, shares, clicks, etc.)
		• Number of impressions
		• Views on YouTube
•@ Mentions
		• Number of @ Mentions
• Responses to Posts/Direct Messages
		• Response time

Be open and transparent.

STRATEGIC PRIORITY #2:
FOSTER COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS
RTD has a history of strong collaboration with its local,
regional, state and federal partners. As the agency
leads the way in exploring and implementing future
mobility, collaboration will have many layers. Among
the partnerships that will be crucial to success are
cities and counties across the region in determining
how to best serve local communities; local, state,
federal and private partners to optimize funding
opportunities; and all public and community partners
to engage with and educate the public about RTD’s
projects and programs.
Because RTD provides a public service, strong
community relationships and partnerships are
essential to RTD’s ability to understand opportunities

and challenges, and gain support for changes
and additions to the services that we provide.
This requires proactive participation and outreach.
The most effective way to do this is to leverage
our largest group of advocates – RTD staff.

Attachment: Strategic Communications Plan 1.28.20 (4089 : Communications Update)

11

RTD employees interact with customers and
communities throughout the District daily. As a result,
many of us are regularly conducting some form of
outreach or engagement whether we know it or
not. Cultivating a workplace culture which provides
the tools, methodology, and knowledge of cultural
considerations and community values will allow the
agency to immediately expand engagement in terms
of reach and depth using existing resources.
Packet Pg. 107

MARKETING
Create a centralized collateral or materials catalog.
This catalog will be available on The HUB as a
resource for the agency to access marketing materials,
key messages, list of subject matter experts and
outreach programs. The portal will provide guidance
for requesting materials or topics which are not
available in the catalog through the Communications
Department.
Communicate Through Multiple
Languages and Formats.
In collaboration with others within the group, we will
develop a formalized plan to make RTD outreach
materials, meetings, and communications more
inclusive of groups for which English is a second
language, have limited English proficiency, or have
visual/hearing impairments as well as other needs.
By utilizing industry best practices, data, the expertise
of the committee, and federal requirements as defined
by Title VI, the group will identify needs, processes,
and activation plan. This milestone will utilize existing
translation services or may require contracting
translation and related services as well as a quality
review process.
Provide Materials and Personnel
Support to Foster Outreach.
Whether through development of materials or active
participation with communities, stakeholder groups,
the Board, and TMOs/TMAs, Marketing will offer
essential support in creating and solidifying
community partnerships.
DIGITAL COMMUNICATIONS
Centralize Contact Lists.
Several contact lists exist which have been assembled
by various groups. Through consolidation, we will
develop an opportunity to reduce staff time spent

on re-creating and updating lists, while also creating
transparency. The goal of bringing together lists
for stakeholder groups will also reduce the risk of
inadvertently excluding groups or individuals. A
centralized file containing lists will be accessible by all
communications groups and all groups will be able to
update the list following a process which logs updates
and ensures the latest information is utilized.
MARKET RESEARCH
Listen to All Stakeholders.
In addition to RTD’s annual Customer Satisfaction
Surveys, staff will present opportunities for customers
to provide feedback. Depending on specific needs,
this may occur through focus groups, interviews,
phone surveys, onboard surveys, or online surveys.
MARKET DEVELOPMENT
Grow Pass Programs.
The Market Development staff will continue to promote
and work with businesses, communities, nonprofit,
schools and other organizations to determine the best
pass program and to promote the benefits associated
with each pass program. The Market Development
team will continue to look for opportunities to attend
business and community events to promote all
fare modes including pass programs. The team will
promote new opportunities to partner with hotels,
restaurants, businesses, schools and others utilizing
new technology through the RTD mobile app and
partner portal.

Through its oversights of TMOs and TMAs, Special
Events will continue to cultivate community

initiatives to these organizations and ensure that they
have targeted plans and materials to address our
challenges and opportunities across our service area.

PUBLIC RELATIONS AND ENGAGEMENT
PUBLIC RELATIONS
Communicate in a proactive and
transparent manner.
When RTD has progress or news to share – whether
information, good news or bad news – the agency
will develop a communications work plan to ensure
that audiences are notified in a timely and proactive
manner. The plan will also outline a hierarchy or
order of communications to ensure that information
is prioritized and shared with tiers of stakeholders
in strategic fashion. Stakeholders are categorized
in the following tiers:

• Tier 1
• RTD Board and Senior Leadership Team
• RTD staff
• Tier 2
• L ocal, state and federal elected officials and staff
• Area business and community stakeholders
• Tier 3
• Customers
• General public
• Media
• Special interest groups

developed for the RTD website and News Stop using
fact sheets and key messages.
Email blasts to specific stakeholders will be sent as
needed.
Establish a Proactive Media Strategy.
Another component of proactive and transparent
communications was the creation of the RTD
newsroom, the News Stop (launched Sept. 19, 2019).
This allowed the agency to develop its own narrative
and share relevant news and information with the
public instead of allowing the news and social media
to set the narrative for and about RTD. This also
allowed the agency the opportunity to anticipate and
respond to developments and evolving situations that
generate media interest in a rapid manner. The News
Stop has utilized blogs, videos, through leadership
articles and developing and informative news stories.
In addition, periodic media visits help foster and
maintain vital relationships with the media.
Another tactic will be the development and execution
of a Rapid Response Plan that will strategically guide
the agency through these situations.

Speaking in a unified voice is another way the
agency strengthens communications. Developing
key messages and fact sheets on topic areas or
issues helps guide RTD Board members, staff and
key stakeholders share consistent information. When
addressing challenging issues, speaking in one voice
and being upfront and accountable influences the
public’s perception of agency transparency.

Hold Regional Communicators briefings
twice annually or as needed.
A valued resource is the network of regional
communicators, including Public Information
Officers (PIOs), in the metro area to help share
RTD’s information and messages to their constituents.
Keeping regional communicators informed about
RTD’s projects and challenges is an invaluable
extension of the team.

To accomplish this, communications work plans will
be developed for events, developments and issues.
Additionally, topic-area or issue-specific key messages
and fact sheets will be developed. Content will be

Hold annual PIO coordination meetings with police
and fire PIOs to address how accidents, crimes and
threats are handled when they involve RTD property,

This committee will bring together representatives
from multiple RTD departments which regularly
conduct outreach and engagement. The group will
hold regular meetings to exchange information on
upcoming needs, outreach opportunities, strategy
and collaboration. They also will establish standards
to help reinforce outreach and engagement principals
throughout the agency on an ongoing basis. To
accomplish this, participants will be responsible for
assisting in the roll out of information, standards for
engagement and outreach, training, and related
activities for the successful expansion or community
engagement throughout the district.
Internal Reporting Process for Community
Engagement and Outreach.
With several departments receiving requests for
community outreach, a reporting system will track
where efforts are being conducted, the topic and
outcome. Reporting reduces duplicate efforts
and utilizes resources in a highly efficient manner.
Departments will be held accountable through
monthly reporting, followed by regular updates to
RTD Senior Leadership Team on milestones and
staff participation or challenges.
Target Outreach to Diverse Audiences.
Staff will continue to identify diverse sectors of
the community and develop enhanced outreach
activities to engage with people in a way that is
easy, comfortable, safe and convenient for them.
Regular outreach activities will be customized based
on the needs of community groups and the interest
in or impact from certain topics, issues or projects.
Participate in Monthly Regional Events.
Coordination with the Executive Office and Senior
Leadership is intended to ensure RTD representation
at stakeholder meetings and events. It is critical

that messaging is synchronized, timing is strategic
or appropriate and reach of key topics is spread to
multiple audiences. Below are examples of regular
meetings in which practitioners of Community
Outreach and Engagement will participate in:

• Metro Mayors Caucus (MMC) meetings
• DRCOG meetings
• TMA Monthly Outreach meetings
• Local Coordinating Councils (LCCs)
• Local Government Groups
PROJECT OUTREACH
Implement Proactive Project Public Information.
As RTD plans and implements State of Good
Repair maintenance to existing system, FasTracks
projects and new studies, staff will develop
Communication Work Plans to keep elected officials,
key stakeholders, residents and businesses informed
of project progress, benefits and impacts. Activities
such as Elected Officials Briefings, email updates,
community presentations, media briefings, pop-up
events, project tours, fact sheets, key messages
and business outreach meetings will be deployed
throughout the project process.

GOVERNMENT RELATIONS

Government Relations staff will work to expand
engagement with local, state and federal elected
officials, including working proactively to ensure that
the Board and staff are collaborating strategically
with key stakeholders on regional matters. Staff will
continue to coordinate meetings and communications
with elected officials. Additionally, staff will continue
to coordinate visits from other cities and countries
that want to view and hear about RTD’s successes
and emulate those that will work for them.

MARKETING
Expand Marketing, Customer, and
Employee Information Programs.
RTD launches numerous individual and coordinated
marketing campaigns each year to educate and
inform the public about the value and benefits of
RTD, ridership, projects, new or expanded services,
service changes, pass programs, safety, workforce
development and events. We also develop materials
and messaging around internal events and agency
communications. These opportunities provide
powerful methods to share customer information.
By further solidifying our brand and messaging
through these initiatives, as well as measuring
response for calls-to-action (digital, mail, etc.) we
can create better opportunities for education.
DIGITAL COMMUNICATIONS
Make It Easy For People to Engage Digitally.
The Digital Team will continue to evolve the RTD
website to enhance navigation and availability of the
most relevant customer information. Included are
ongoing metrics to measure and monitor usage rates
on a month-to-month basis. Other efforts include
promotion of the text messaging feature for Rider
Alerts and contributing to the implementation of
digital customer information displays.
MARKET RESEARCH
Listen to the People.
Internal and external research is a key component to
improving communication. We do that by conducting

employee surveys to determine awareness and usage
of RTD communication channels. This helps us to
understand the information employees want from
RTD and the manner in which they prefer to receive
it. And it’s important to share results of surveys
across the agency. We will also measure preferences
toward RTD’s information channels to determine the
topics/ information which are of greatest interest to
readership. Measuring customer attitudes toward
RTD is also a priority to understand how customers
view RTD with regard to brand, safety, reliability,
affordability, financial stewardship, etc.
MARKET DEVELOPMENT
The Market Development will continue to provide
on-going communications to coordinators in each
pass program with any updates or changes to pricing
or program policies. The team will provide detailed
information and continue to partner with TMOS/
TMAs to inform external customers of the benefits of
using transit and providing a transit pass. The team
will provide analysis and overall explanations of the
various pass programs to internal customers. The
team will also explore new opportunities with
advancing technology to increase participation
in the various pass programs.

Share timely information.
PUBLIC RELATIONS AND ENGAGEMENT
PUBLIC RELATIONS
Continue and Expand Internal Communications.
RTD’s employees are among the most important
ambassadors to share information and be storytellers
about the agency’s service, programs and
progress. Employees are also brand ambassadors,
showcasing the agency’s values and personality.
Plans are to streamline RTD road shows across the
divisions to share various news items and updates;
get the Senior Leadership Team out in the field
and have “face time” with different work groups;
and establish periodic managers’ messages so
that managers and supervisors can share the
latest news and information in a unified voice.
Internal communications specialist will further
develop and continue the focus group series as
well as maintain ongoing collaboration with the
internal communications committee to enhance
communication with employees.
Work with Community Partners to Enhance
Communications to Our Customer Base.
The team will utilize relationships with community
partners to enhance the flow of information to
their constituents who ride the system. Regional
communicators are key partners to share information
with their constituents by posting information on
their websites and social media platforms, sharing

videos on their cable channels and including
information in newsletters.
COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT
Enhance Safety Education.
Safety education is an ongoing part of RTD’s
community outreach. Staff makes annual visits to
schools around RTD’s rail lines to educate them
about being safe around trains. Near-miss campaigns
provide an eye-opening message to showcase the
need to stay alert and refrain from being distracted
when maneuvering around trains or buses. And
RTD’s Community Engagement team partners with
suicide prevention advocates with hopes of reaching
those who are facing tough times, and for those who
feel that life has gotten off track, that there’s hope.
PROJECT OUTREACH
Provide Information to our Stakeholders
in a Timely Fashion.
The agency is continually introducing new
projects/studies or providing State of Good Repair
maintenance to existing infrastructure. This ensures
the safety and reliability of the system. Staff will
proactively inform its internal and external audiences
of projects that may cause service disruptions or
somehow impact their daily transit experience. Staff
will distribute periodic information updates/email
blasts to elected officials and key stakeholders and
customers on specific projects.

GOVERNMENT RELATIONS

Keep elected officials and key stakeholders
informed and engaged.
Local, state and federal elected officials, their staff
members and key stakeholders are partners in RTD’s
mission to provide safe, reliable transit service and
transform transportation as it evolves. They help secure
funding, pass legislation to enhance RTD’s ability to
continue its role as the region’s transit operator and
continue the Denver metro region’s national model of
regional collaboration.
Communications will continue to evolve the annual Fact
Book/Annual Report to the Community to communicate
the facts about RTD, progress being made, successes
and challenges to educate elected officials and make
them aware of RTD’s accomplishments.

CUSTOMER CARE

Enhance the customer experience.
The agency has several tools to communicate
information to its riders, and is working to be more
proactive as it looks to enhance the customer
experience through timely notifications and improved
tools. Customer Care staff provides dynamic information
and customer-focused responses to questions and
complaints via multiple channels. Further enhancement
to our new Rider Alert system will allow riders to receive
alerts via text message as well as email, and the ability
to receive more targeted alerts for the services utilized.
Transitioning to Salesforce as our consolidated and
multi-functional customer relationship management
(CRM) system will provide staff the ability to track,
monitor and respond to customer questions and
concerns more efficiently, while better understanding
customers overall relationship with RTD.

relationships and public support for RTD.

members, staff, local elected officials and community members. The selection process
and pending Board decision are “top of mind” as you are well aware. We have worked
closely with the board office and executive committee and will continue to provide
information and updates to external stakeholders throughout the process and into the
national search for a new permanent general manager.
2. Reimagine RTD – Maria and I met with RTD planning staff and Reimagine RTD
consultants on January 6 to discuss the current political environment locally and
perceptions about the Reimagine project. We also provided insight regarding current
Metro Mayors Caucus member discussions and the impact 13 new mayors in the region
will likely have on the caucus itself. Several cities are concerned about the service
reductions and we expect pushback from a number of jurisdictions. We plan to meet with
staff and the consulting team again soon and will continue to support the effort.
3. Citizens Advisory Committee – The next CAC meeting is from 3-5 PM on February 19.
The Committee heard from new Board Chair Angie Rivera-Malpiede at their January
Meeting and also participated in a second workshop with the Reimagine RTD
consultants. Finally, Joanna Morsicato was elected co-chair for a two-year term.
4. Metro Mayors Caucus Annual Retreat – The Metro Mayors Caucus held its Annual
Retreat on January 11. RTD and transportation in general were major areas of discussion
at the retreat. Speaker KC Becker shared information on likely legislation and mayors
shared frustration about service cuts, incomplete rail lines, etc. No surprises, but an
opportunity to vent, Chair Rivera-Malpiede attending the retreat and had the opportunity
to speak one-on-one with a number of mayors as well as provide a short update.

Re:

February Board Report

BBMK continues to have discussions with Senators Tate and Rodriguez and Rep. Jackson about
their potential legislative proposal concerning the district. Rep. Larson has also added his name
as a co-sponsor of the legislation and BBMK is meeting with him this week to provide an update
on our discussions thus far with stakeholders.
Bills of Interest
HB20-1089 Employee Protection Lawful Off-Duty Activities sponsored by Rep. Melton. This
bill prohibits an employer from terminating an employee for the employee's off-duty activities
that are lawful under state law even if those activities are not lawful under federal law. BBMK
will be attending a stakeholder meeting on this bill convened by Rep. Melton this week.
HB19-1138 Public Real Property Index sponsored by Reps. Coleman and Larson and Senator
Bridges and Gardner. The bill requires all municipalities, in addition to all political subdivisions
of the state, to report “usable real property” owned or under their control to the State Architects
office annually. BBMK attended a stakeholder meeting on the bill and requested an
amendment to exempt RTD rights of way from the bill.
HB20-1151 Expand Authority for Regional Transportation Improvements sponsored by
Rep. Gray and Senator Winter. This bill allows a Transportation Planning Organization to act as
and retain the powers of a Regional Transportation Authority, allowing it to impose charges, fees
and, with voter approval, taxes to generate transportation funding. This bill has not been
scheduled for a hearing.
SB20-044 Sales and Use Tax Revenue for Transportation sponsored by Senator Lundeen and
Rep. Carver. This bill would require beginning in July 2020 that 10 percent of net revenues from
sales and use tax as a portion of sales and use taxes attributable to sales and use tax of vehicles
and related items be credited to the HUTF. The distribution of the funds would be 60% to the
state highway fund, 22% to counties and 18% to municipalities. The bill is scheduled for a
hearing in the Senate State Veterans and Military Affairs Committee on January 29 at
1:30pm.

SB20-065 Limit Mobile Electronic Devices by Driving sponsored by Rep. Roberts. The bill
would limit the use of a mobile electronic device while driving to adult drivers who use the
mobile electronic device through a hands-free accessory. The bill establishes penalties of $50
and 2 points for a first violation, $100 and 2 points for a second violation, $200 and 4 points for a

third or subsequent violation and $300 and 4 points if the violation involves text messaging. The
bill has not yet been assigned a new senate sponsor occasioned by the resignation of Senator
Court. BBMK is working on amendment to address the District’s concerns.
SB20-061 Yield to Bicycles in Bicycle Lanes sponsored by Senator Foote. The bill creates a
new traffic offense for failing to yield to a bicycle in a bicycle lane. The offense is a class A
traffic offense unless it is the proximate cause of a crash or if it causes bodily injury, then it is
careless driving and is punished under the careless driving offense. RTD is exploring this
legislation for possible impact to the District. The bill is scheduled for a hearing in the Senate
Judiciary Committee on February 3, at 1:30pm.

Delegation Efforts to Secure RRIF CRP Fix Continue
SPB continues to work with RTD’s Congressional delegation to secure a firm dollar figure from US
DOT’s Build America Bureau and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for the pay-for to
fund our CRP fix. Previously, US DOT and OMB gave our delegation staff a $70 million figure,
with many caveats as to the accuracy of the number. Staff for Rep. Perlmutter, Sen. Gardner, and
Sen. Bennet are now in discussions with US DOT to firm up the pay-for figure. As all new
spending must be paid for with either new revenues or offsetting cuts in spending, identifying an
accurate number for the cost of our CRP fix is an essential next step in crafting – and paying for –
our CRP fix in either the 2021 appropriations cycle or in the next surface transportation bill. SPB
will receive an update from Congressional staff on this subject during the week of January 27 and
will update the Board thereafter.
On January 28, the Senate Commerce Committee’s Transportation and Safety Subcommittee will
hold a hearing on US DOT’s Build America Bureau. The Bureau oversees the RRIF program, and
Bureau head Morteza Farajian will testify at the hearing. Senator Gardner serves on this
subcommittee, so SPB has asked Senator Gardner’s staff that Senator Gardner directly seek Morteza
Farajian’s support for the full refund of CRPs for all repaid RRIF loans, including cohort 3 loans like
RTD’s.
In addition, SPB continues our bicameral, bipartisan approach to securing the RRIF CRP fix by
submitting formal FY 2021 appropriations requests, with draft legislative language, to every member
of the RTD delegation. Congressional offices use these appropriations requests to help shape their
spending requests and priorities. By making these formal requests, we help ensure that RTD
pursues every viable avenue for the RRIF CRP fix and we unite the entire Congressional delegation
behind a single legislative proposal.

House Democrats to Unveil Sweeping Infrastructure Proposal

House Democrats begin this latest infrastructure push with a hearing on the most challenging issue
of all: how to pay for it. On January 28, the House Ways and Means Committee will hear from
witnesses on the topic of Paving the Way for Funding and Financing Infrastructure Investments.
US DOT Publishes Notice of Funding Opportunity for Low or No Emissions Grant
Program
On January 17, the Federal Transit Administration announced a Notice of Funding Opportunity for
$130 million in FY 2020 funding for the Low or No Emissions Program (Low-No Program).
Eligible projects include the purchase or lease of low or no emission buses, constructing or leasing
facilities and related equipment for low or no emission buses, rehabilitating or improving existing
facilities to accommodate low or no emission buses, and workforce development. The maximum
Federal cost share is 85 percent for low or no emission vehicles and 90 percent for related
equipment or facilities. Eligible sources of local match are listed in the Notice of Funding
Opportunity. US DOT estimates it will make 45 grant awards. Grant applications are due March
17.
RTD was awarded a $2.6 million Low-No grant in April 2019 (from FY 2019 funding), and SPB
secured letters from the Congressional delegation in support of RTD’s application. If RTD decides
to apply for FY 2020 funds, SPB will again pursue letters of support and will ensure RTD can take
advantage of meetings in Washington DC in March to directly advocate for the grant award.
White House Releases Proposed Rule Overhauling NEPA Regulations
On January 10, the White House released a proposal for revised regulations to implement the
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), which governs the evaluation of environmental
impacts of major Federal actions, including federally-funded transit projects. Comments on this
rulemaking are due March 10.
NEPA-required environmental reviews generally take between four and seven years to complete; a
major goal of this rulemaking is to expedite the process and shorten the time needed to complete
the review. Specifically, the new rule:
• States that the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) will no longer have
to consider cumulative effects of new projects;
• Revises the definition of effects;
• Requires Environmental Impact Statements (EISs) to be completed in two years; and
• Mandates a single agency lead for projects, as opposed to all agencies within a project’s
jurisdiction.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) announced that House Democrats will release an infrastructure
proposal the week of January 27. While little information has been released about the proposal, it is
widely understood that the package will be broad principles rather than legislative text and will cover
several modes of transportation and infrastructure, not only surface transportation. Separately,
Speaker Pelosi has given House Transportation and Infrastructure Chairman Peter DeFazio (D-OR)
one of her reserved bills (H.R. 2) for his still-developing surface transportation bill.

2.C.4.a

On January 8, Secretary Elaine Chao and the US Chief Technology Officer (head of the National
Science and Technology Council) released the fourth version of its Autonomous Vehicles policy
document, Ensuring American Leadership in Automated Vehicle Technologies (AV 4.0). As with previous
iterations, the document includes very broad policies and few specifics. Compliance with the
guidance is voluntary. Unlike prior versions, 4.0 takes a government-wide approach to fostering
automated technologies, including via programs of agencies other than US DOT. AV 4.0
emphasizes the Administration’s commitment to fostering surface transportation innovation and
outlines the Administration’s main principles for AV policy: (1) protect users and communities;
(2) promote efficient markets; and (3) facilitate coordinated efforts. US DOT intends to solicit
comments on AV 4.0, although no formal comment period has been announced yet.
