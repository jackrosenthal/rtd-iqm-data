BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Aurora CELO Annexation

Committee Meeting Date:
April 6, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
April 6, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the revised boundary map of the Regional Transportation District
and authorize the Board Secretary to certify the boundary map and description.
It is further recommended that the newly annexed area to RTD pursuant to the provisions of CRS 32-9106.6 (1)(b) be included in Director District F (Director Broom).
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Chris Quinn, Planning Project Manager
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
HB 1295-07 requires that the District revise its boundary map and legal description following any
changes to the District’s boundary. Further, pursuant to CRS 32-9-106.6 (1)(b), any area annexed by an
in-District municipality on or after May 25, 1994, is automatically included in the District. The revised
RTD boundary map and legal description must be approved by the RTD Board and the RTD Board
Secretary must certify the map and legal description to the State and appropriate county. Additionally,
the Board must assign the newly annexed areas to specific Director Districts.
DISCUSSION
The land involved in this annexation is known as the CELO property in the City of Aurora. The property
lies on the south side of East Jewell Avenue approximately half-way between South Harvest and South
Powhaton roads. It encompasses 870,853 square feet or approximately 20 acres and is currently used
for agricultural purposes. With the annexation, the City has zoned the property R-2 for medium-density
residential use, generally permitting single family and duplex housing. As the attached map indicates, the
property is discontiguous with the existing District boundary; however, Director District F (Director
Broom) is the closest Director District to the property.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
No financial impact is associated with this action. It should be noted, however, that the properties are
currently vacant and no RTD service is provided in the general vicinity.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Reimagine RTD Guiding Principles

Committee Meeting Date:
April 6, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
April 6, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt guiding principles to create a framework for decision making for the
Mobility Plan for the Future element of the Reimagine RTD project.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Debra Johnson, General Manager and CEO
William C. Van Meter, Assistant General Manager, Planning
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD began the Reimagine RTD process in 2019 to develop a plan for what is next for RTD. Two primary
deliverables are being developed as part of the plan:
1. System Optimization Plan – a short-term plan focused on redesigning RTD services to balance
mobility needs and RTD’s fiscal limitations
2. Mobility Plan for the Future – a long-term plan focused on strategies to address the region’s
future mobility needs
Staff initiated discussions with the Board about establishing guiding principles for Reimagine RTD at the
August 27, 2019 Board Study Session. Guiding principles can be defined as value statements that help
guide future RTD decision making. During initial discussions with the RTD Board, concerns were
expressed about competing principles and difficulty in prioritizing a finite set of principles. Additional
discussions were held in 2020 during the development of the System Optimization Plan about RTD’s
transit service approach. Those discussions focused on developing a set of service philosophies to guide
future decisions about RTD service. Some consensus was developed amongst the Board during those
discussions about supporting social equity populations, service reliability, and addressing
partnerships/geographic disparities.
During the pause for the Reimagine RTD process between August 2020 and February 2021, RTD’s
General Manager and CEO, Debra Johnson, expressed strong support for establishing a set of guiding
principles for the Mobility Plan for the Future. Based on this direction, staff developed a new set of
guiding principles. This new set of principles was developed based on feedback received earlier in the
Reimagine RTD process from the Board of Directors and stakeholders as well as input from the General
Manager. The new set of guiding principles was presented to the Board of Directors on February 23,
2021. The guiding principles were also presented to the Advisory Committee and the Technical Working
Group for Reimagine RTD on March 10 and 11. Favorable feedback was received at all meetings. The
Advisory Committee and Technical Working Group for Reimagine RTD did express the desire to have
more specificity in the guiding principles. More specificity will be accomplished in the future with the
development of specific outcomes and strategies for each guiding principle.

Packet Pg. 8

2.11.B

DISCUSSION
Guiding principles for the Reimagine RTD Mobility Plan for the Future will be used to establish a
framework for decision making and create an organizing structure for the Plan. The Guiding Principles
include:
-

Mobility – provide safe, reliable transportation service to improve the quality of life of residents,
customers, and visitors.

-

Equity – remove barriers to accessing transportation services that enable customers to have the
freedom to get where they want to go.

-

Financial – leverage resources and maximize cost efficiencies, serving as good stewards of
taxpayer dollars.

-

Partnerships – pursue partnerships with both public and private organizations that help identify
innovative opportunities to enhance mobility throughout the region.

-

Workforce – foster a dynamic, diverse workforce that promotes engagement and innovation,
recognizing team members as RTD’s greatest asset.

-

Sustainability – provide sustainable mobility options while continually seeking to reduce RTD’s
environmental impact.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no expected direct financial impact of this action. The guiding principles will indirectly impact
future financial decisions as they will provide value statements that help guide future RTD decision
making.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Approval of Contract to Purchase Validators for AccountBased Ticketing

Committee Meeting Date:
April 13, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
April 13, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager or her designee to enter into a contract with
Masabi to purchase new bus and rail platform fare validators for the Account-Based Ticketing (ABT)
system.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Ford, Chief Operations Officer
Doug MacLeod, Acting Chief Financial Officer
Tonya Anderson, Senior Project Manager
Paul Snyder, Senior Project Manager
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
In November 2020, the RTD Board of Directors approved the funding needed to advance the AccountBased Ticketing (ABT) system forward with the goal of replacing the cumbersome and obsolete existing
Smart Card fare technology and equipment used for the MyRide card and College and Eco Passes.
The existing Smart Card system is card-based, in which customer balances and transactions are stored
on individual cards. This causes several issues: delays of 24 to 72 hours for customers and RTD in
managing card balances; hampers the ability to perform stored value transactions; limits locations for
card management; limits the types of fares available; and requires more intensive ongoing system
maintenance, coding, and Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliance activities. In contrast, account-based
fare systems, such as ABT, store information by account, allowing for such benefits as real-time
information, the ability for more widespread and varied means of loading fare value, more fare offerings
and flexibility in changing fares, and less maintenance through utilization of hosted environment, all
while also ensuring PCI compliance.
In considering the replacement of the Smart Card system with ABT, RTD has contracted with Masabi to
provide the “back office” technology to be consistent and compatible with RTD’s existing mobile
ticketing platform that is also provided by Masabi. The current target date for completion of this portion
of the ABT implementation is December 31, 2021.
DISCUSSION
A second component of the ABT implementation is the replacement of existing fare validators that were
purchased in 2010 for RTD’s Smart Card fare system. The existing validators have obsolete and
proprietary technology specific to the existing Smart Card system which necessitates replacement with
validators that are ABT compatible.

Packet Pg. 10

2.11.C

These new ABT validators will bring RTD into the modern age of transit payment systems while
providing RTD customers with an improved and easier method for transit payments. Additionally, these
new ABT fare validators will be capable of processing open payments, thereby providing additional fare
payment options to RTD’s customers. Installation of the ABT fare validators is planned with a phased
approach as the legacy Smart Card fare validators are removed.
In order to acquire ABT fare validators, RTD issued a Request for Proposal (RFP) separate from the “back
office” ABT software procurement. This RFP was separate in order to ensure a competitive process and
because these fare validators will be acquired to be compatible with most ABT systems. In addition,
federal grant funding has been awarded to RTD for the ABT fare validator purchase.
After a thorough RFP evaluation and scoring procurement process, Masabi was selected as the preferred
validator vendor and negotiations were completed. The funds needed to complete this work are
$4,054,505, of which $1,813,084 comes from federal funding and, if approved, will allow RTD to work
towards achieving the planned ABT system go-live date December 31, 2021 with a phased-in fare
validator replacement. The period of performance for fare validator replacement is tentatively planned
for October 2021 through December 2021.
The validator vendor was evaluated and selected on a best value basis with the following scoring
criteria:
•
•
•
•
•

40% technical specifications and ability to meet stated requirements
20% overall cost
20% experience of the vendor and project team
10% timeline and ability to meet deadlines
10% DBE (Disadvantaged Business Enterprises) evaluation

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The estimated cost of contracting the replacement ABT fare validators is $4,054,505. Funding will be
provided by RTD in the amount of $2,241,421 plus federal grant funding in the amount of $1,813,084
both of which were included in the 2021 budget. This contract will have five one-year options for
extended hardware and firmware support in the amount of $29,946 annually. If all five options are
exercised, this will result in an additional cost of $149,730.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Budget Transfer for Railroad Liability Insurance Premiums

Committee Meeting Date:
April 13, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
April 13, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager or her designee to authorize a budget
transfer of $400,000 to fund increased commuter rail liability insurance coverage and premiums for
the N-line.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Melanie J. Snyder, General Counsel
Doug MacLeod, Acting Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
Section 24-10-115(7), C.R.S., requires a public entity that obtains insurance for claims arising from
passenger rail operations to insure against the federal liability cap set forth in 49 U.S.C. § 28103. RTD
maintains insurance for the N-line consistent with contractual requirements for easements from BNSF
and Suncor. Pursuant to the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act, on February 26, 2021,
the U.S. Department of Transportation issued a notice of adjustment to the Rail Passenger
Transportation Liability Cap from $294,278,983 to $322,864,228. In order to increase its insurance
limits to meet this increased cap, RTD has identified insurance providers to provide this increased
coverage which has resulted in higher insurance premiums that were not budgeted.
DISCUSSION
RTD is seeking Board approval to transfer funds from the General Manager’s Contingency Fund to fund
the increased insurance premiums since the amount of the transfer exceeds the General Manager’s
authority. The increased premiums total $362,597 for the insurance coverage period of March 26,
2021 – September 30, 2021. This request seeks a transfer of $400,000 to allow for foreign currency
translation adjustments since the insurance providers are domiciled in Bermuda and any unencumbered
funds will be used for the next renewal period beginning October 1, 2021 or returned to the General
Manager Contingency Fund.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The General Manager Contingency Fund was appropriated by the Board with the approval of the 2021
Budget. Therefore, there is no net financial impact to the 2021 Budget, however, the financial impact to
RTD annually will be increased premiums of approximately $800,000.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Request for Budget Transfer Paratransit Software
Replacement

Committee Meeting Date:
April 13, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
April 13, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager or her designee to authorize a budget
transfer of up to $4,000,000 to fund activities for the upcoming Paratransit Software Replacement
contract.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Ford, Chief Operations Officer
Paul Hamilton, Senior Manager, Paratransit Services
Eric Farrington, Senior Project Manager, Information Technology
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
In 2008, RTD began using Routematch software to schedule paratransit service. This software, still in
use, is costly and outdated. RTD needs a new software system. The software does not offer mobile or
web portal trip booking and management for customers. IT staff developed portals to address this
shortcoming. As it stands, the software lacks basic modern functionality needed to optimize and fully
support the Agency’s paratransit customer base. Additionally, Routematch has developed a new cloudbased product and will cease to support RTD’s current system. Thus, the system requires replacement
due to obsolescence.
DISCUSSION
RTD needs a new software system which would improve productivity over the current system, thereby
saving RTD approximately between $2,000,000 and $4,000,000 annually. These savings can be
leveraged to offset the costs for a vendor to implement new technology savings to pay the selected
contractor. RTD is asking proposers to work at risk, based on confidence that they will be able to
improve productivity and be paid from the productivity savings. Due to the budget forecasting in 2020
for 2021, whereby budget savings were identified, staff is now seeking authorization to provide funding
through a budget transfer of up to $4,000,000 to fund this work.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The estimated unfunded cost of contracting the replacement software and onboard hardware is less than
$4,000,000. Funding is available from existing operating funds currently designated for Access-a-Ride
fuel and transportation. This is in anticipation that those proceeds will not be needed for their original
intent due to reductions in fuel and operating costs due to increased Access-a-Ride productivity.
Therefore, there would be no budgetary impact, rather a transfer of funds would be completed from
Operating Funds into Capital Projects.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
June 2021 Proposed Service Change

Committee Meeting Date:
April 13, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
April 13, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the June 2021 Service Changes and to authorize the General
Manager or her designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose
services are impacted by these changes.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Ford, Chief Operations Officer
Pauletta Tonilas, Assistant General Manager, Communications
Jessie Carter, Acting Senior Manager of Service Development
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 minutes
BACKGROUND
At the February 2, 2021 Communications and Government Relations Committee meeting, staff shared
with the Board of Directors the plan to launch an overarching enhanced approach to stakeholder
engagement throughout the District, as a continuous effort to foster open dialogue. This is an
opportunity for the Board and staff to hear directly from key stakeholders on RTD matters that matter
most to them. One aspect is conducting a round of stakeholder engagement sessions at the beginning of
each service change process to hear feedback from stakeholders about transit services in their
communities. The stakeholder listening phase is in addition to the public listening phase, which will
begin this month as part of the June service change process. Both the stakeholder feedback and the
public input will help inform RTD’s future service plans.
DISCUSSION
Transit ridership remains significantly lower than pre-COVID levels which is affected by a lack of
commuter activity based on remote working and learning practices that have been effectuated due to
health orders. Moreover, public health orders remain in a protective posture and the agency’s COVID-19
service plan levels are reflective of the current challenges facing the District.
While ridership remains relatively unchanged, a review of ridership at the route/line level does support
increases and adjustments to some route services showing higher levels of ridership. Additionally, transit
system maintenance to improve on-time performance and service reliability is needed on both bus and
rail services. The proposals herein, contain a mix of service enhancements and adjustments that address
transit system connectivity and contract compliance, while maintaining the necessary resource capacity
to support social distancing throughout the transit network.
It is intended that the service adjustments proposed to the current COVID-19 service plan be adopted as
further modification to the initial COVID-19 service plan implemented April 19, 2020 and modified in
January 2021. Many of the routes proposed for service improvements serve vulnerable communities that
are transit dependent. These customers often perform essential jobs and have continued to utilize RTD
services during the pandemic.

Packet Pg. 17

2.11.F

The Board adopted guidance for proposed service changes continue to be:
• Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
• The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
• The availability of alternative services to affected customers;
• Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
• Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also, disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
• Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
Given the current economic conditions due to the COVID-19 induced economic slowdown, the
overarching guidance for the proposed June 2021 service changes come from the Board adopted
guidance for COVID-19 Budget Reductions, especially Principle number three (3):
“We will prioritize mobility for people who must depend on transit during the pandemic: we will strive to
maximize mobility during the pandemic for those customers who most depend upon our services to
access essential jobs and their necessities, while also keeping our community activity centers
appropriately connected.”
SUMMARY OF PUBLIC HEARINGS

Service Equity Analysis
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B Title VI Requirements and Guidelines
provides recipients receiving Federal financial assistance with directives for compliance with Title VI of
the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Executive Order 12898 regarding Environmental Justice. In this
Circular, the FTA requires RTD to evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that
exceed the established major service change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a
disproportionately adverse impact on minority or low-income populations.
Staff assessed the 35 proposed June 2021 service changes and the results indicate none of the changes
meet the major service change threshold. Therefore, a service equity analysis is not required per RTD’s
Title VI major service change policy.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The overall estimated financial impact contained in this proposal is designed to be cost neutral.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
COVID-19 Title VI Service Equity Analysis

Committee Meeting Date:
April 13, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
April 13, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt the Title VI Service Equity Analysis report to comply with federal
laws, regulations and guidelines related to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Zamy Silva, Civil Rights Senior Manager
Jessie Carter II, Service Development Senior Manager (Acting)
Carl Green Jr., Transit Equity Manager
PRESENTATION LENGTH
30 minutes
BACKGROUND
On March 24, 2020, the Board of Directors approved adjustments to RTD services as a result of the
COVID-19 pandemic. RTD’s reduced service delivery plan was effectuated on April 19, 2020 and is
summarized in Attachment A.
RTD employed a well-reasoned, balanced, and equitable approach to determine how best to reduce
services based on the demand, while also serving regional needs and maintaining optimal service for
essential purposes. Priority was placed on preserving access to key activity centers, such as hospitals
and major health care providers, as well as major employment centers. Retaining service in low-income
and minority-populated areas was also important as more ridership were seen on those routes and lines
in those geographic areas in comparison to other areas.
Subsequently, the Board of Directors approved adjustments to RTD services in July 2020 for the
September 2020 Service Change Proposal (see, Appendix A of Attachment B) and October 2020 for the
January 2021 Service Change Proposal (see, Appendix A of Attachment B). With steep declines in
ridership (70% reduction) and an uncertain return to higher demand, service reductions enacted with the
January 2020 runboard are currently in place. Taking a holistic approach, RTD took reasonable measures
to implement service changes equitably dating back to the April 2020 COVID-19 related reductions
through the March 2021 service changes in order to prevent unintentional discrimination.
DISCUSSION
The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) published guidance on April 7, 2020 to provide clarity
regarding how COVID-19 preparations impact certain FTA requirements. The guidance details when a
Title VI service equity analysis must be performed for emergency service reductions and changes during
the pandemic. Specifically, if a transit agency chooses to make any temporary changes permanent, then
the transit agency is required to complete a service equity analysis to ensure the changes do not unfairly
impact minority and low-income populations. Of note, a permanent change is any service change lasting
longer than 12 months. The 12-month threshold will lapse April 19, 2021. Thus, an analysis is required
to be brought before the RTD Board of Directors for approval. The complete Title VI Service Equity
Analysis report is shown in Attachment B.

Packet Pg. 45

2.11.G

RTD’s Title VI Service Equity Analysis Policies
Per FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Major Service Change Policy, a Disparate
Impact Policy, and a Disproportionate Burden Policy. Collectively, these policies provide the foundational
requirements for evaluating service change proposals for equity. These policies and their applicable
thresholds are listed below:
Major Service Change Policy: A major service change is defined as a 25 percent addition or reduction in
the service hours of any route that would remain in effect for twelve (12) or more months. All major
service changes will be subject to an equity analysis.
Major Service Change Results: Changes to 103 existing bus route/patterns and rail lines in RTD’s
network of 167 services from April 2020 to April 2021 met the established thresholds for a major
service change. The following routes had service reductions or were eliminated:

Title VI Policies:
Disparate Impact Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a minority population 10
percent more than non-minority populations; this level of impact is considered a disparate impact.
Disproportionate Burden Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a low-income
population 10 percent more than higher-income populations; this level of impact is considered a
disproportionate burden. A low-income population is a group of households who are at or below 150
percent of the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.

Packet Pg. 46

2.11.G

Methodology:
Disparate impact and disproportionate burden analyses were performed at the route level, route block
group, and network level, to identify any potential disparities in service changes based on race/ethnicity
or income.
Summary of Findings:
• Of the 103 routes with major service changes or reductions, none had adverse impacts when
comparing the service reductions of equity populations with those of non-equity populations.
Low-income routes had a 13% lower reduction than higher income routes and minority routes had
12% less of a reduction than non-minority routes.
•

Of routes that were major service changes, 14 had potential disparate impact findings, and 27
had potential disproportionate burdens findings.

•

Of routes that were eliminated, 12 had potential disparate impact findings, and 38 had potential
disproportionate burdens findings.

•

Of new services or restructures, 7 routes had potential disparate impact findings, and 6 had
potential disproportionate burdens findings.

•

30 of 40 routes had smaller reductions in service than the corridor’s primary route, and all
eliminated routes had net corridor service changes that reflected a smaller reduction in service,
indicating the availability of other RTD services within one-quarter of mile of the corridor, on
average.

Conclusions:
Title VI concerns are minimal compared to the COVID-19 service reductions and subsequent service
changes in September 2020 and January 2021. Overall, the system-wide service reductions have
impacted equity groups moderately less compared to non-equity groups. However, because some of the
major service changes resulted in a potential disparate impact or a disproportionate burden they have
been identified for further examination and will be prioritized for future service increases.
Keeping top of mind, the agency’s on-going response to the pandemic, the substantial ridership decline,
resource allocation, and the recovery timing uncertainty signifies the agency’s substantial legitimate
justification for maintaining the COVID-19 related service changes made in April 2020.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The adoption of the COVID-19 Title VI Service Equity Analysis does not result in any direct or
foreseeable financial impacts.

Executive Summary
The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) published guidance on April 7, 2020, to provide clarity how
COVID-19 preparations impact certain FTA requirements. The guidance details when a Title VI service
equity analysis must be performed for emergency service cuts and changes during the pandemic.
Specifically, if a transit agency chooses to make any temporary changes permanent, the agency is then
required to complete a service equity analysis to ensure the changes do not unfairly impact minority and
low-income populations. Of note, a permanent change is any service change lasting longer than 12
months.
With steep declines in ridership and an uncertain return to higher demand, service reductions enacted
within the January 2020 runboard have remained in place until the current March 2021 runboard.
Moreover, RTD reduced service on April 19, 2020, to reflect the reality of declining ridership resulting
from the COVID-19 pandemic. Because these changes are approaching the end of 12-month period, the
FTA considers these changes permanent and requires an equity analysis to be performed. This document
summarizes the detailed analysis of the service changes between April 2020 and April 2021 to ensure
changes have not inequitably impacted minority and low-income populations.

Methodology
RTD’s established Title VI program methodology defines the process to identify major service changes,
disparate impacts, and disproportionate burdens. Analyses were performed at the route level, route
block group, and network level, to identify any potential disparities in service changes based on
race/ethnicity or income.

Major Service Changes
Changes to 103 existing bus route/patterns and rail lines in RTD’s network of 167 services from April 2020
to April 2021 meet established thresholds for a major service change. The routes listed below had
proposed reductions to service or were eliminated.

Findings
When considering all routes in the RTD network, and compared to the average 31% reduction in service,
low-income routes had a 13% smaller reduction compared to higher-income routes, and minority routes
had a 29% smaller reduction than non-minority routes.
Of the 103 routes with major service changes or reductions, none had adverse impacts when comparing
the service reductions of equity populations with those of non-equity populations. Low-income routes
had a 13% lower reduction than higher-income routes and minority routes had 12% less of a reduction
than non-minority routes.
Bus routes had a larger cut in service than rail modes, and of these bus routes with reductions in service,
suburban local and regional route service classes had greater reductions or more eliminations than Central
Business District (CBD) local and local route service classes. Limited stop routes were more likely to be
eliminated than local routes.
Of routes that had major service changes, 14 had potential disparate impact findings and 27 had potential
disproportionate burdens findings. Twelve routes had both.
Of routes that were eliminated, 12 had potential disparate impact findings and 38 had potential
disproportionate burdens findings. Nine routes had both.
Of new services or restructures, 7 routes had potential disparate impact findings and 6 had potential
disproportionate burdens findings. Three routes had both.
Corridor service changes within one-quarter mile of routes were reviewed for net service area changes,
incorporating the network benefits of overlapping and/or intersecting services. This analysis found 30 of
40 routes had smaller reductions in service than the corridor’s primary route, and all eliminated routes
had net corridor service changes that reflected a smaller reduction in service, indicating the availability of
other RTD services within a ¼ mile of the corridor, on average. However, only the corridor surrounding
Route 37 was found to have a net service change under the major service change threshold of 25%.

Introduction
Title VI and Environmental Justice
Equity is a core principle of the Regional Transportation District’s (RTD) mission to provide mass transit
service in the Denver Metro Area. An equitable mass transit system fairly distributes the benefits and
adverse effects of transit service without regard for race, color, national origin, or low-income status. This
principle is detailed and reinforced by Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Executive Order 12898
pertaining to environmental justice.
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin
in programs receiving federal financial assistance. Specifically, Title VI states, “No person in the United
States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied
the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial
assistance.”
In 1994, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12898, which states that each federal agency “shall
make achieving environmental justice part of its mission by identifying and addressing disproportionately
high and adverse human health or environmental effects of its programs, policies, and activities on
minority populations and low-income populations.”
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI and Environmental Justice. In this
circular, the FTA requires RTD to evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that
exceed the established major service change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a
disproportionately negative impact on minority or low-income populations.
This equity analysis report has been prepared to document changes that occurred between the January
2020 and March 2021 runboards, representing the prior 12 months of service. Routes with major service
changes include 40 major reductions, 63 eliminations, and 10 added services. In September of 2020, with
the opening of the N Line, a highly anticipated commuter rail line to the north suburbs, supporting bus
services were restructured. As a result, several routes underwent changes that on the surface appear to
be major service changes (e.g., a single route split into two patterns, route name changes, replacement
with other named routes, etc.). These changes and all others have been reviewed individually and in
aggregate at the block group and system levels to identify actual major changes.

2.11.G.b

An equity analysis is triggered by proposed major service changes to the transit services provided by RTD.
These changes include the addition of new routes, the elimination of existing routes, and changes to the
alignment and trip frequency within existing routes. RTD has established principles to identify the service
changes needed to meet the diverse travel needs of the residents of the District and maintain a highperformance, sustainable transit system.
RTD Service Changes Guiding Principles
• Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
• The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
• The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
• Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
• Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color
or national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
•Response to changes in the communities where services are provided.

RTD services are divided into various service classes depending on service type, route alignment, and
frequency. Each service class has its own service standards derived from the performance of all routes
within each class. RTD continually and comprehensively adjusts services in response to changes in
ridership and operational performance of the transit system. It is also the District’s responsibility to
identify services that are underperforming and recommend modifications, curtailment, or cancellation of
service as warranted. In keeping with Colorado Revised Statutes, RTD utilizes official service standards to
establish performance metrics used to identify underperforming services on a class-of-service basis. The
District uses these metrics to identify a series of service changes. Equity analyses examine the impact of
the proposed major service changes on minority populations and low-income households at or below 150
percent of the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.

…The general assembly further finds that the district should be organized efficiently,
economically, and on a demand-responsive basis and that the district should consider leastcost alternatives in discharging its responsibilities. The general assembly further finds that the
farebox recovery ratio of the district must be improved so that resources once allocated for
mass transportation can be made available for other surface transportation needs.
--Colorado Revised Statutes 32-9-119.7 Farebox Recovery Ratios -- Plans

RTD’s Title VI Equity Analysis Policies
Per FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Major Service Change Policy, a Disparate
Impact Policy, and a Disproportionate Burden Policy. Collectively, these policies provide foundational
requirements for evaluating service change proposals for equity and compliance with Title VI. These
policies and their applicable thresholds are listed below:

Service Change Philosophy

1. Major Service Change: A major service change is defined as a 25 percent addition or reduction in
the service hours of any route that would remain in effect for twelve (12) or more months. All
major service changes will be subject to an equity analysis that includes an analysis of adverse
effects.
a. An Adverse Effect is defined as a geographical or temporal reduction in service that
includes, but is not limited to, eliminating a route, shortening a route by eliminating
segments, rerouting an existing route, and increasing headways. RTD shall consider the
degree of adverse effects and analyze those effects when planning major service changes.
2. Disparate Impact Analysis: A major service change should not adversely affect a minority
population 10 percent more than non-minority populations; this level of impact is considered a
disparate impact.
3. Disproportionate Burden Analysis: A major service change should not adversely affect a lowincome population 10 percent more than higher-income populations; this level of impact is
considered a disproportionate burden. A low-income population is a group of households who
are at or below 150 percent of the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.
If a proposed major service change results in a disparate impact or a disproportionate burden, RTD will
consider modifying the proposed service change. RTD will then analyze the modification and make sure it
removed the potential disparate impact or disproportionate burden. If a less discriminatory option cannot
be identified and RTD can demonstrate a substantial legitimate justification for the proposed service
change, the FTA may allow RTD to proceed with the proposed change.

Analysis
Data Sources & Methodology
Demographic data used for this analysis comes from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey
(ACS) 5-Year Estimates for years 2014 to 2018 and is reviewed at the census block group geographic level.
Analysis of RTD’s network footprint and route service levels utilized Remix, a transit-planning software
package combining data analysis with transit service planning tools. One key evaluation tool is the Title
VI analysis used for service equity analyses which compares existing service, converted into annualized
bus visits, or trips, to a set of proposed service changes. The annualized bus visits conversion is a helpful
proxy for route service changes since any change in service levels will be proportional to the resultant
annualized change in trips. Other data includes route alignments and block group geography. The linking
of these datasets into a service-geographic-demographic combination relates equity populations with
changes in service at a geographic level to aid in reviewing impacts.
The equity analysis is a three-tier process reviewing impacts first at an individual route level, then at an
aggregated route block group level, and finally at a District/block group level, being careful to realize that
analyses done at aggregate levels could hide major service change impacts occurring at a more granular
level, so detailed analysis is done at each tier to avoid overlooking potentially adverse impacts on equity
groups.
Low-income status for population within the District derives from the Census Bureau and is based on 150%
of the United States federal poverty level (Department of Health and Human Services guidelines), based

on local context, which is an annual income of $32,580 for a family of 3. Minority status was based on the
non-white and Hispanic or Latino count of total population. The service area was based on the collection
of block groups within the District boundaries set by RTD for Remix.
Route service area population was determined using a quarter mile “catchment area” centered around
bus stops and rail stations. This catchment area was then used to calculate the percentage overlap of
census block-based population underneath. For instance, if a catchment area contained 100% of the
underlying block group, 100% of the population would be associated with the services within a quarter
mile; if 50% of a block group was contained in the catchment area, only half of the underlying population
would count as being included (ratios of population demographics would be unchanged).
Remix provides a count of trips in the “before” and “after” networks at the block group level and
aggregated at the route pattern level but does not provide a change of trips by route by block group,
which was needed for more detailed analysis at the route level. For this third tier of analysis, route
alignments from RTD’s General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data were used to calculate the quartermile catchment area of every route to relate the route trip change data from Remix to individual block
groups associated with each route.

The public was also notified of the ability to submit comments to service.changes@rtd-denver.com. The
main comments were related to the opposition of the Route LD and Route LX service change. Other emails
were general inquiries about the Route 37 and 46.
Covid-19 Service Reductions (April 2020)
RTD’s traditional outreach and community engagement was not pursued due to the nature of the April
2020 service reductions. In short, the ability to devise and carry out a robust and inclusive outreach
strategy was limited due to a compressed timeline and resource constraints. This was a result of the sharp
decline in ridership attributed to the coronavirus pandemic. To summarize, the community engagement
efforts, all outreach was conducted electronically via media releases, updates on the main RTD webpage,
email blast to our customers and service alerts on the lines where service was reduced.
Customer Care staff received comments during the Covid-19 service reductions. These comments were
compiled daily and sent to a team of RTD staff. Most comments related to Covid-19 service reductions
were due to being passed up by a full bus, bus overcrowding, and operators or customers not wearing a
mask. Additionally, there were concerns of rear door boarding for customers with a disability as well as
specific route suspensions and eliminations.
Routes that received a high number of complaints for pass ups and overcrowding include routes 12,
15/15L, 16, and 0. Routes 43 and 121 did not receive the same volume of complaints regarding pass ups
and overcrowding but were notably higher than other routes. These local routes have a higher number of
minority and low-income customers compared to the system district average.

Comment Summary
There was a strong opposition to the RunRide suspension due to the BolderBoulder’s 3 use and
dependency on this service. Additional strong opposition was related to the Mallride, Route 99L, 32, 16L,
225, JUMP and 403 service cuts. Of these routes both the 99L and 16L had a noticeably larger number of
people make comments regarding their reliance on these routes to have access to work and other
essential trips. The Route LD trip cuts proved to be a concern for those in Lafayette as it was described
that the current service is already minimal.
Several members of the public voiced concern regarding the R Line, 153, and 157 as they are all routes
some local residents rely on. Residents in Aurora gave mention to already drastic changes in service that
have occurred by RTD in the recent years. Due to issues with connectivity, transfers, and access the D Line
was brought up. Some commenters wanted it to return to how it previously was and there was also a
desire not to end the weekend trips this service provides. Also, two people brought up the conditions of
the Lafayette Park-n-ride. RTD staff informed them it is currently in construction and is being worked on.
Additional comments were made regarding the operator shortage as commenters asked questions related
to what is causing it, and how to solve the issues so cuts do not have to be made. RTD staff fielded
questions to assure the public that resolutions are being identified.
Emails
The public was notified of the ability to submit comments to service.changes@rtd-denver.com. Emails
were received from all parts of RTD’s service area. Key routes of concern according to email volume
included the Runride, Route 157, Route 153, and the R Line.
Mail
Cards with the words “No to Cuts” were received from residents in Aurora. The cards detailed service
changes of concern that were reflective of emailed comments as well. The key routes of concern included
Route 153, Route 130, Route 169, Route 157, H Line, E Line, and the R Line.

On July 14, 2020 the Board approved the recommended action to approve the implementation of the N
line and subsequent changes related it. It was not considered a service change and modifications were
nuanced changes with the Covid-19 plan.
Public Meetings
Five public hearings were held during the public comment period, which extended from August through
September of 2019. The meetings were held in Thornton City Call, Northglenn Senior Center, Blake
Street Offices, and the City of Westminster. There were 60 participants in attendance at the public
meetings total. Detailed comments from each meeting can be found in the July 14, 2020 consolidated
agenda starting on packet page 17. 4
In summary the main questions and concerns during the public comment period were the actual date of
the 2020 N Line opening. Approximately seven people made remarks indicating doubts of predicted
2020 opening due to past delays. General questions regarding how the N Line will affect other routes
were the next frequently asked questions. Additionally three people had concerns of the frequency of
the 92/93L frequency. One person mentioned that the 88 on time performance was not accurate and
one other person mentioned a desire to extend the route further. The 104L and 39L going away were of
the most concern to those that spoke at the public meetings.
Email
The public was notified of the ability submit comments to service.changes@rtd-denver.com. One letter
was received from the Westminster Mayor’s office concerns and support for the proposal. Specifically
there were concerns noted regarding the Route 120 boarding location due to the proximity of a high
volume road and the AA projected to have a negative citizen reaction due to added travel time. A
positive note regarding the 114 changes to added connections was also noted.
January 2021 Service Change
Notification was given to customers about the January 2021 service changes via rider alert emails about
upcoming service changes and the opportunity to submit feedback by emailing service.changes@rtddenver.com, faxing comments to 303.299.2227, or calling 303.299.6000.
Virtual Meetings and Events
RTD hosted a series of 5 virtual public outreach sessions in the first half of October 2020 to provide an
overview of proposed service changes. Microsoft Teams meetings were limited to 250 participants per
meeting. Four Microsoft Teams meetings were held with the option to participate via telephone or
through the Microsoft Teams App. The table below shows the dates and number of attendees per

Major Service Change, Disparate Impact, and Disproportionate Burden Analysis
Service changes made between January 2020 and March 2021 that resulted in a 25% or greater reduction
or addition in service were categorized by equity grouping (minority or non-minority, low-income or
higher income) for comparison. Routes were categorized as either equity or non-equity based on their
identification within the January 2020 network using 2018 ACS 5-year demographic data. A comparative

equity analysis was completed to review the routes individually. This analysis identified the equity and
non-equity populations within a route service area and compared those against the equity and non-equity
populations of the District. If impacted equity populations within the route service area received 10% or
greater impacts compared to non-equity populations, the route had a potential finding of disparate
impact or disproportionate burden (depending on the impacted equity population) and was flagged for
more detailed review of block groups within the route’s service area. This was intended to identify
network-level impacts that would indicate whether 25% or more service was changed for the underlying
population groups due to overlapping or intersecting services.

Changes by Transit Mode
When annual service changes were reviewed by mode, light rail had a 23% reduction of service over an
annualized count. Commuter rail increased due to the introduction of N Line service and rail overall was
reduced by nearly 16%. Bus service was reduced by nearly 34%. The overall average for the system was
a reduction of roughly 31%.

Major service changes between January 2020 and March 2021 included a total of 103 routes/lines that
received major service reductions or were fully eliminated. Of these routes, 40 had major service
reductions and 63 were eliminated.

Changes by Route Service Class
Service changes were reviewed by service class, categories generally describing the geographic location
or service area (and unique performance thresholds) of each route. Service changes included all major
service reductions or additions. Service classes include 4 categories for bus services: Central Business
District (CBD) Local, Urban Local, Suburban Local, and Regional, a rail category, and 3 special services
(MallRide, MetroRide, and the Englewood Trolley). Generally, service cuts were more severe for
suburban local and regional services, than CBD or Urban Local routes. Rail received the fewest cuts,
likely due to mandated service levels on commuter rail services and new N Line commuter service. CBD
locals, and the related downtown services of MallRide and MetroRide as well as Regional services, had
more reductions in service compared to Urban Locals.

Major Service Change Review
A complete listing of all service changes can be found in Appendix A. Changes were first reviewed in
aggregate equity groupings of routes prior to individual review of routes, route block groups, and overall
network levels; equity grouping comparison occurred at every level. Major service changes are
categorized as the following:
•
•

Major Service Reductions or Eliminations (a service reduction of 25% or more)
Major Service Increases/Restructuring (service increases of 25% or more related to new or
restructured service)

Major Service Change Reductions/Eliminations
Routes with major service changes included 40 routes with service reductions of 25% or greater and 63
eliminated routes, totaling 103 routes with major service reductions or eliminations (see table below).

Ten routes were found to have major service change increases, due to their occurrence in the September
2020 runboard and their association with the introduction of the N-Line and related service restructuring.
These included the following routes: N Line, Route 49, Route 88L, Route 93L, Route 104L, Route 120E,
Route 120L, Route 520, Route NB1 and Route NB2.
Routes 49, 88L, 93L, 104L, and 120E/L are directly attributed to N-Line service. Route 520 was part of a
route restructure from the elimination of Route RC and other changes in Brighton. Finally, the NB route
to Nederland was split into two patterns, NB1 (primary route) and NB2 (seasonal).

Route-Level Analysis
Having identified the service changes which meet the definition of Major Service Change, the next step in
the analysis is to look at each line individually to determine potential Disparate Impacts (minority
populations) and/or Disproportionate Burdens (low-income populations). Both service reductions and

Major Service Change Increases

service increases are analyzed. For service increases, the analysis examines the extent to which the
benefits of the improvements are inclusive of minority and low-income populations. For service
decreases, the analysis examines the extent to which the adverse effects of the reductions are
disproportionately borne by minority and low-income populations.
DISPARATE IMPACT AND DISPROPORTIONATE BURDEN ANALYSIS
For each route with a major service change, determine the percent of the route’s impacted equity
and non-equity populations comprising the District’s equity and non-equity populations; if the
difference is greater than 10% for equity populations, additional review is required for potential
adverse impacts

In concert with RTD’s Title VI policies, the demographics of each of major service change routes were
reviewed for potential disparate impact (DI) or disproportionate burden (DB) findings. In summary, the
review of these adverse impacts determined the following:
•
•
•

33 routes met the threshold for a potential disparate impact
77 routes met the threshold for a potential disproportionate burden
24 met thresholds for both impacts

A complete listing of all potential DI and DB findings can be found in Appendix B.

Route-Block Group (Corridor) Analysis
This analysis reviews service changes reviewed at the route-block group level. This reviews the impacts of
overlapping and intersecting services to determine the “net” service change within a route corridor. For
instance, if an eliminated limited service operated in the same corridor as a local service, the net change
determined from the route-block group analysis would group all the trips together to determine the net
effect of the elimination. This provides an aggregate, high level indication of the average amount of service
provided to the average user randomly across the route’s corridor. It is an imperfect analysis, however,
since it does not provide a true sense of alternative connections to the average user within that corridor
based on how service levels changed for the primary route. However, because many of RTD’s routes
operate within a grid network, it can provide a sense of overall service levels.
ROUTE-BLOCK GROUP (CORRIDOR) ANALYSIS PROCESS
1. Identify routes with major service reductions or increases of 25% or greater and potential
disparate impact or disproportionate burden findings
2. Identify block groups within those route service areas and determine net (corridor) change
in service
3. Routes with alignment changes will compare old and new alignments for impacts
4. Route corridor major service changes of 25% or greater (+/-) should be reviewed for
potential DI or DB impacts as previously determined

Of the 40 routes with major service reductions, the corridor “net” service review found 30 routes that
had a lower net corridor change in service. Of the 63 eliminated routes, all routes had net corridor
service changes with less of a reduction. Table 8 provides a summary of routes with major service
changes, organized by service change type (reduction, elimination, addition), individual route service
change percent between January 2020 and March 2021, and the “net” percent corridor service change.
Routes with green shading are those where the net corridor service change is of a smaller magnitude than
the individual route service change.

A network analysis is not typical in RTD’s equity analyses but was used to understand the large number of
service changes occurring across the network. A network level analysis has potential to provide further
understanding of changes to service levels for Title VI protected populations at aggregate levels.
While RTD has not established a formal policy for a network level analysis, the major service change
threshold of 25% or greater used for individual route-level analyses was used as precedent to determine
potential adverse impacts overall and to identify structural issues in areas requiring further review. Once
average District thresholds for low-income and minority populations were established, subsequent equity
analyses focused on the subset of District block groups that experienced major service changes of 25% or
greater (additions or reductions in service), and whether equity block groups with major service changes
experienced service changes of 10% or more compared to non-equity block groups. Routes with major
service changes are later comparatively reviewed for potential adverse effects at route-block group levels
(block groups within route service areas).
The analysis of the combined service changes identified the following:
•

•

•

•

Systemwide, service was reduced by 31.8%, with almost one quarter of light rail service reduced
(existing commuter lines were contractually obligated to be maintained and overall service
improved due to new N Line service) and almost a third of overall bus service cut. Major service
changes were applicable to the entire network.
Due to cratering ridership and difficulty with staffing, 63 bus routes were eliminated, and 40 of
167 total routes had cuts of 25% or more, though the net effect is less when accounting for direct
replacements (such as local routes substituting for limited routes) or changes related to the N Line
opening.
Comparing changes Districtwide and only for areas with major service changes greater than 25%,
low-income block groups and minority block groups received fewer cuts than non-equity block
groups, staying under the 10% difference threshold.
At the route level, equity routes and non-equity routes 7 were compared both District-wide and
only for those with major service changes (in this case, nearly all changes were reductions when
excluding new or replacement routes related to the N Line opening). The comparison found that
while the system had drastic cuts, equity routes received far fewer reductions in service than nonequity routes: low-income routes saw 13% fewer cuts than higher-income, and minority routes
received 29% fewer cuts than non-minority routes.

In aggregate, a review of all routes found no adverse impacts between equity and non-equity routes.
Systemwide, although low-income routes had a greater number of annual trips reduced than higherincome routes, the reductions resulted in a 29% decrease in service compared with the 42% reduction in
higher-income routes. The reductions to minority-classified routes were lower, both in terms of annual
trips and percent change, than non-minority routes. As a result, minority routes were reduced 16%,
compared to 44% for non-minority routes.

Based on existence of the route within the January 2020 network and the population within a quarter mile of bus
stops or rail stations. 2018 5-Year estimates were used for population identification.

This pattern continued with routes that underwent major service reductions. Low-income routes
underwent a decrease of 55% in annual trips compared with higher-income routes that underwent a 68%
reduction. Minority routes underwent a 49% reduction in annual trips compared with 61% for nonminority routes.
In terms of major service increases, low-income routes will have 36% more trips than higher-income
routes. Similarly, minority routes will have roughly 5 times as many trips than non-minority routes (74,290
more annually).

For the January 2020 to March 2021 network change, an analysis of all District block groups and their
service levels was conducted to establish the baseline equity thresholds for low-income and minority
populations and to determine the systemwide magnitude of impacts of the January 2020 to March 2021
service change. Block groups with low-income and minority populations at or above the District average
are referred to in this analysis as “equity” block groups whereas higher-income and non-minority block
groups are referred to as “non-equity” block groups.

NETWORK ANALYSIS PROCESS
Determine block groups at/above District averages for low-income population (16.8%) and minority
population (35.4%)
Determine which block groups experienced service changes of 25% or more
Of block groups with a major service change, compare the difference in annual trips for equity versus nonequity block groups; if the difference is more than 10%, review for potential adverse impacts

There are 1,916 block groups defined as being wholly within or mostly within the District 8. Using the 2018
5-Year ACS Estimates, total population residing within these block groups was calculated as well as the
total minority population and total low-income population, calculated separately, to determine the
District-wide low-income and minority rates which set the thresholds for which block groups are classified
as above average. While the percent minority figure of 35.4% was derived by using the base population
of the service area (3.019 million) the low-Income population percentage of 16.8% is derived from a
slightly smaller population figure. This is due to the smaller population whose poverty status the Census
Bureau can determine 9. The thresholds summarized in Table 0 yielded 751 (39% of all) block groups above
the District average for low-income population, and 715 (37%) block groups above the District average for
minority population.

Table 11 summarizes the change in trips for equity and non-equity block groups District-wide, only block
groups with major service reductions, and only those with increases. Most block groups across the District
received substantial service reductions, however, systemwide service reductions appear to have
impacted equity groups modestly less than non-equity block groups, but service increases were mixed
with higher-income and minority groups receiving more service than low-income and non-minority
groups. For block groups with a major service reduction, those with above average low-income population
received around 3% fewer cuts, block groups with above average minority populations received around
5% smaller reduction in service compared to non-minority block groups. For block groups with major
service increases, primarily due to the introduction of N line service and restructuring, higher-income
block groups received more service. Minority block groups received nearly 12% more trips than nonminority block groups with major service increases.

Some block groups are not completely contained within the District boundaries due to differences in boundaries
between the District and Census-defined geographies.

The total population whose poverty status is determinable/assessed is lower than the estimate of total
population and results in a different base population used to determine low-income percent of population.

Figures 2 and 3 illustrate the location of above average low-income and minority block groups within the
District. Low-income populations and minority populations appear to overlap in similar areas outside of
central Denver, including most of Aurora, Commerce City, and Brighton, and areas east of Boulder, and
areas southeast of Longmont. Low-income populations appear to have greater spread, with additional
areas in the mountain communities and areas west of Downtown Denver.

The January 2020 to March 2021 changes in annual trips by route are symbolized in Figure 6. The purpose
of this map is to provide a generalized view of where service is changing at the route level. The March
2021 bus and rail network, as well as the eliminated routes from the January 2020 network are colorized
according to the percentage change in the annual trips. The March 2021 network resulted in several
routes being eliminated or truncated. These routes and the truncated segments are shown in red. In
instances where several routes serve one corridor, the colors are layered to give preference to green down
to red. Therefore, some truncated segments may not appear as they continue to be served by other
routes. However, routes that have been eliminated entirely but are still served by other routes will outline
the continuing service in red. An example of this scenario is the D-line, which is shown in green and
outlined in red. This is the result of the elimination of the C-line with slight increases in D-line service.
As detailed in the map, the majority of route eliminations are occuring in the periphery of the network
and regional in focus. This includes some of the connections between Longmont and Denver, for example.
Most of the urban core routes will face limited reductions in service, represented in yellow, although some
of the east to west bus connections in the urban core are eliminated. In terms of service increases or new
routes, represented in green, much of it is due to the introduction of N-Line commuter rail service and it’s
related bus services that serve the stations. Some of it is also due to the consolidation of overlapping
services, such as the Nederland routes west of Boulder.

Summary of Findings
The primary objective of this equity analysis was to examine proposed changes to RTD’s network at the
individual route, route block group, and network route and block group levels, to determine if low-income
and minority populations were more adversely impacted with changes than higher-income and nonminority populations. Future analyses may separate network analyses from traditional equity analyses
and network analyses may rely on different service change thresholds and may be subject to additional
refinements to identify potential adverse effects to equity populations. For instance, network changes
could be compared to see how equity areas receive service over time or routes could be grouped into
equity classes to also see how those routes are served longitudinally.
The network changes that occurred between January 2020 to March 2021 include the continuing service
changes originally proposed in April 2020 to address the continuing impacts of ridership and revenue loss
due to the current COVID-19 global pandemic. Ridership behavior has exhibited acute changes that are
without historical precedent. Routes primarily serving office-type jobs (some CBD locals and particularly
Regional services) have seen steep declines as have routes that primarily serve educational campuses
since telecommuting and virtual learning have supplanted in-person interactions. Routes that provide
service for predominantly equity populations, or those who may more likely be essential staff working in
health care, public safety, government, food systems and other service sectors lacking remote work
options, have had fewer reductions in ridership. As such, RTD has prioritized service changes that attempt
to account for ridership demands while maintaining social distancing as much as possible on other routes.
A summary of potential disparate impacts and disproportionate burden findings include the following.
Disparate Impacts
An analysis of routes with major service changes found 40 routes with major service reductions, 63
eliminations and 10 new services. Of the routes with reductions, potential disparate impacts were found
for 14 of the 40 routes, and of the 63 eliminated routes, 12 were found to have potential disparate
impacts. (Twelve routes had both DI and DB findings.) Of routes categorized as new or restructured
services, 7 were found to have potential disparate impacts.
When accounting for corridor service levels to determine a net service change across a route’s corridor,
some routes may have a smaller service change impact. This accounted for overlapping and intersecting
services that may provide a similar level of service. Accounting for this review, only Route 37 had a smaller
corridor service reduction comparing to the route level change. Of the eliminated routes, the AA route
was found to have a service change under -25%.
Disproportionate Burden
An analysis of routes with major service changes found 40 routes with major service reductions, 63
eliminations and 10 new services. Of the routes with reductions, potential disproportionate burdens were
found for 27 of the 40 routes, and of the 63 eliminated routes, 38 were found to have potential
disproportionate burdens. (Nine eliminated routes had both DI and DB findings.) Of routes categorized
as new or restructured services, 6 were found to have potential disproportionate burdens.
When accounting for corridor service levels to determine a net service change across a route’s corridor,
some routes may have a smaller service change impact. This accounted for overlapping and intersecting

services that may provide a similar level of service. Accounting for the corridor review, Route 37 had a
smaller corridor service reduction comparing to the route level change like the potential disparate impact
finding. No eliminated routes had a corridor service change under the major service change threshold.
Table 12 summarizes major service changes by change type, provides findings of potential disparate
impacts and disproportionate burdens based on a comparative difference analysis, provides the individual
route service change, and the net corridor service change. Routes with green highlighted net corridor
service change values indicate routes where the net corridor service change was found to be below the
25% threshold for major service changes. Note that this differs from green highlighting found in Table 8
which identified net corridor service changes that were simply lower in magnitude than the individual
route service change.

May 2020 Service Changes
Due to an ongoing operator shortage, the May Service Change Proposal included a mix of service
adjustments and reductions aimed to prevent missed trips and improve service reliability. The May 2020
Service Change proposals reflected the need to reduce the number of operators necessary to provide
RTD’s transit services, thereby better matching service offerings to the operator headcount at the time.
Changes were approved by the board on the March 10, 2020 during the Operations and Customer Service
Committee as a recommended action. However, the service changes were not implemented due to Covid19. Details of the service reductions can be found in the FA&A/Ops Consolidated Agenda 11 starting on
packet page 3. Table A-2 provides the change type, route, and description of the board approved change.

September 2020 Service Change
Under normal circumstances the board approves September 2020 Service Changes at the July Operations
and Customer Service Committee as a recommended action. Due to the nature of Covid-19, the Covid-19
service plan was still in place during the July meeting, however updates were made to the ongoing Covid19 service plan. The list of changes to the Covid-19 service plan were provided to the board on July 14,
2020 and can be found on the FA&A/Ops Consolidated Agenda 13 starting on packet page 71.
At the July 14, 2020 meeting, the Board approved the recommended action to implement the N line and
subsequent changes related it. It was not considered a service change and modifications were nuanced
changes with the Covid-19 plan.

•

Return of school tripper service operated via Special Service Order, to maximize flexibility, as
school districts complete their plans for the upcoming school year

January 2021 Service Change
The proposed January 2021 service adjustments were a mix of service enhancements, service reductions
and service suspensions in order to maximize ridership within the very limited resources available to the
District as a result of the financial shortfalls resulting from the COVID induced economic slowdown. The
proposals included a mix of service adjustments that represent the redeployment of resources available
during the COVID-19 service plan.
Weekday ridership on local bus service continued at levels approximately 45% of pre-COVID levels while
ridership on Regional services, Flatiron Flyer services and light rail services saw weekday ridership declines
of 75%-85%. These ridership numbers were largely affected by reduced commuter activity and reduced
employment center occupancy.
Overall, the proposals redirected resources from services that were underperforming to services that have
passenger capacity challenges due to limits set by social/physical distancing policies that limit capacity on
each RTD vehicle to approximately 30% of pre-COVID capacity. Additionally, the proposals modified
service patterns and levels of service on rail corridors to more effectively match service to ridership
demand.
The January 2021 service changes were approved by the board on the October 20, 2020 during the
Operations and Customer Service Committee as a recommended action. A list of the approved changes
with a brief summary are included in the Table A-4 below. A full detailed summary of changes can be
found in the FA&A/Ops Consolidated Agenda 14 starting on packet page 144.

Appendix C: Route Service Area Comparative Equity Population
Analysis by Service Change Category
An additional analysis was performed on demographics within subsets of routes within the RTD network.
This analysis extends beyond RTD’s Title VI Program requirements and represents a more granular
examination of potential impacts to equity and non-equity groups. This analysis aims to provide greater
detail on the overall impacted populations within equity groupings of routes by the related service change
impacts. Results from this analysis may be informative when considering future modifications to service
for equity populations.
The population within one-quarter mile of route/line stops/stations was totaled for different tiers of
routes. Total population, minority population, non-minority population, low-income population, and
higher-income populations were totaled within each subset of routes. Each equity population’s
comprising share of the District equity population was determined for comparison purposes, similar to
the route level comparative difference analysis. Routes were categorized by those with major service
reductions/eliminations and those with major service additions. Within those two categories, routes were
further divided into low-income/higher-income and minority/non-minority routes based on the service
area demographics of those routes within the January 2020 network. As with previous analyses presented
in this report, demographics are sourced from the 2018 ACS 5-Year Estimates.
Equity and non-equity populations were compared within each subset of routes. For instance, minority
and non-minority populations were compared within low-income routes that had major service
reductions/eliminations. Similarly, low-income and higher-income populations were compared within
minority routes that received major service increases.
The results from the analysis indicate potential adverse effects to subsets of population by route service
change category. Low-income routes that received major service reductions/eliminations appear to
potentially affect minority populations 14% greater than non-minority populations. When looking at
minority routes that had service reductions/eliminations, minority populations were potentially affected
up to 53% more than non-minority populations.
Low-income populations living with the service area of low-income routes that received a major service
reduction/elimination appear to be potentially affected 40% more than higher-income populations within
those route service areas. For low-income populations within minority route service areas that received
a service reduction/elimination, their potential impact was 42% greater than higher-income populations.
For routes with service increases, minority and low-income populations appear to be potentially
benefiting more than non-equity groups. Service increases for low-income and minority routes appear to
potentially benefit minority populations more than non-minority groups; minority route increases
potentially benefit both equity groups as well. Interestingly, lower-income populations within higherincome routes with service increases benefited nearly 750% more than higher-income populations.

exercising the first one-year option, extending the term of the contract through July 13, 2021.
As of March 3, 2021, RTD has contracted for a total of $33,476,278 in services to be delivered through
the current contract end date of July 13, 2021, with $923,722 remaining of the contract not-to-exceed
value. As of the January 2021 invoice, RTD has paid out a total of $27,891,344 on this contract.
The Triunity-Hill Joint Venture includes a certified DBE as 51% managing partner. RTD has set a DBE
goal of 27% for this contract. As of March 3, 2021, actual DBE participation has been 48.66% of the
contract value.
DISCUSSION
RTD is in the closing phase of several operational FasTracks corridors. It is crucial to retain the
institutional knowledge needed to close out all contracts, finalize Right-of-Way needs and meet final
reporting requirements for FTA grant projects. The proposed time extension to the Triunity-Hill Joint
Venture contract would make the resources available to RTD to complete the project closeout in a timely
and cost-effective manner.
As part of the contract closeout process, RTD faces potential claims and lawsuits related to its projects.
Support from the Triunity-Hill Joint Venture staff involved in the original issue could be critical to
resolving the issues in a manner that would be most favorable to RTD.

Moreover, Triunity-Hill Joint Venture will continue to provide specialized services and staff in support of
FasTracks and Base System operations.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The total contract value for the Triunity-Hill Joint Venture contract would increase by $3,000,000 to a
not-to-exceed amount of $37,400,000, with a time extension through July 13, 2024. Funding for this
contract is included in the 2021 Budget within the specific projects where CMSC support would be
utilized. Any future year funding would be identified and approved based on needs and funding
availability.

Committee Meeting Date:
April 13, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
April 13, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO, or her designee, to execute all
documents necessary to enter into a Funding Agreement with the City of Boulder for financial support
for HOP circulator operations within the commercial areas of the City of Boulder, the University of
Colorado at Boulder and adjacent business and residential areas for calendar year 2021 for an amount
not to exceed $978,092.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE

PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
The City of Boulder (Boulder) has supplemented RTD’s bus service within the City by providing circulator
bus service, known as the HOP, since October 1994. The HOP provides mobility and access to Boulder’s
commercial areas, the University of Colorado at Boulder, and adjacent business and residential
developments.
RTD provides extensive bus service to/from and within Boulder and has worked collectively with Boulder
staff to ensure that these services are attractive, effective and complementary for people living, visiting,
and working in the area. The HOP connects to many local and regional RTD bus routes, as well as with
the Downtown Boulder and Boulder Junction at Depot Square Stations.
In early 2020, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the HOP operated 10-minute frequencies during the day
and 15-minute frequencies at night and on weekdays; 15-minute frequencies during the day and 20minute frequencies on Saturday nights; and 15-minute frequencies during the day and 20-minute
frequencies Sunday nights and on holidays. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in
ridership declines, the HOP service was modified to a Saturday schedule on weekdays and on actual
Saturdays. This represents an approximate 20-25% reduction in service hours from pre-pandemic levels.
DISCUSSION
In January of 2021, RTD’s General Manager and CEO, members of her leadership team, as well as staff
met with Boulder and HOP staff to discuss the history and longstanding HOP partnership; the parties
continued commitment to supporting and enhancing the HOP service; and, the planning challenges faced
for the current year given the uncertainty of ridership and COVID-19 recovery. During the meeting
Boulder staff shared that the City’s Amended Budget Process begins in April and requested RTD’s
assistance with service planning and budget efforts for the remainder of 2021.
The agreement is for one year. The first portion of the agreement was executed under the General
Manager and CEO’s authority for the period of January 1 through March 31, 2021 for an amount not to

2.12.I

exceed $244,523.
The second portion of the agreement will be for April 1 through December 31, 2021, for an amount not
to exceed $733,569. RTD funding for HOP operations in 2021 is at 60% of the funding level agreed to
in 2020, which was $1,630,154.
From June 2020 through February 2021, HOP ridership has been approximately 468 daily boardings
which is a reduction of 78% from 2019 when daily ridership averaged 2,140 boardings. RTD and
Boulder staff are monitoring ridership regularly, especially as in-person learning resumes at the University
of Colorado Boulder Campus, and are working cooperatively to ensure that service levels can meet
demand. It is important to note, the City of Boulder reported that 65% of HOP ridership is directly linked
to the University of Colorado Boulder Campus.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
HOP operations funding was included in the approved 2021 Budget. Nothing herein obligates RTD to
renew or extend this Agreement.
