BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

From:

Heather McKillop,
Administration

Date:

October 2, 2018

Subject:

Amendment to 2018 Amended Budget

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: October 3, 2018
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: October 16, 2018

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended that the Board of Directors adopt Resolution No. ___, Series of 2018 to amend the
2018 Amended Budget for the Base System for 1) the inclusion of a new capital project, and 2)
increase to the appropriation.
General Manager’s Goals
Core Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management
Task Goal #1 – Fiscal Sustainability
Task Goal #3 – Asset Management/State of Good Repair
BACKGROUND
The revision to the appropriation in the 2018 Amended Budget for the Base System consists of a new
capital project for $21,733,160 for the continuing purchase of 27 Light Rail Vehicles (LRVs). Originally
approved in the 2018-2023 SBP, this project was inadvertently omitted from the new capital
appropriation in the 2018 Amended Budget. The purchase of the LRVs will be fully funded from
previously-issued COP (Certificate of Participation) funds.
The result of these revisions is an increase in the District-wide appropriation of $21.7 million to
$1,990.5 million as summarized below from the attached Exhibit I.
Only the change to the Base System appropriation and District-wide appropriation is shown below. The
FasTracks appropriation is excluded because there are no changes to FasTracks. No change is made to
the estimated operating and non-operating revenue and neither is summarized below.

DISCUSSION
The project for the purchase of 27 LRVs to be made by the Base System was carried as a line item in
the approved 2018-2023 SBP. When developing the 2018 Budget, which uses the SBP as a basis, the
project funds scheduled to be drawn in 2018 were inadvertently omitted from the new capital

Packet Pg. 4

1.B.1

appropriation. The total project funds were to be drawn over a period of 3 years from 2016-2018.
Funds for 2016-2017 were programmed and appropriated in their respective budgets but funds for 2018
were missed, and there was not a sufficient amount to carry forward to cover the expenditure in 2018.
The purchase of the LRVs will be fully funded from previously-issued COP funds, which is already
included in the 2018 Budget. No new funding will be needed to complete this purchase.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Capital expenditures in Exhibit I for the Base System will be increased by $21,733,160. No
additional funding beyond previously-issued COP funds is needed to cover this expenditure in 2018.
The debt service reserves in the Net Position section of Exhibit I will be decreased by equal amount
to show use of COP proceeds.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended that the Board of Directors adopt Resolution No. ___, Series of 2018 to amend the
2018 Amended Budget for the Base System for 1) the inclusion of a new capital project, and 2)
increase to the estimated unrestricted year-end fund balance.
2. Do not amend the 2018 Amended Budget. This is not recommended because the 2018 Budget
would not reflect adjustments necessary and the purchase of the LRVs would not be completed.

Reconciling items reflect cash activity in capital projects, inventory, accounts receivable and prepaids, accruals and capitalized interest.

2

Reserves include funds that are legally restricted by bond covenants, other contracts, Board designation and policy guidelines.

3

Reserves are an appropriated reserve which is available to fund unforseen projects expenses (such as a contingency reserve).

4

Reserves respresent revenues that are designated to be spent in future years for the construction of the FasTracks capital program.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
adopts the 2019-2024 Mid-term Financial Plan.
General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management
Task Goal #1 – Fiscal Sustainability
POLICY REFERENCE
Fiscal Policy Statement – Capital Improvement Policies 1 and 7, Budget Policies 13 and 14
BACKGROUND
Capital Improvement Policy 1 of RTD’s 2018 Fiscal Policy Statement states that “On an annual basis,
RTD will prepare and update annually a six-year Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) including projected capital
construction and improvements, service levels and operating costs, and revenues to fund the capital and
operating programs.” Capital Improvement Policy 7 states that “RTD will prepare an annual update of
the FasTracks Annual Program Evaluation (APE) which will be integrated with the SBP incorporating
actual costs incurred and the most recent available projections of capital improvement costs, service
levels, and operating costs and revenues to fund the FasTracks capital and operating programs.”
The Mid-term Financial Plan is a six-year financial plan and consists of the Base System SBP and
FasTracks APE. The SBP includes only service and projects funded from the Base System 0.6%
sales/use tax, and FasTracks operations activity. The APE includes FasTracks expense and projects
(non-operational) funded from the FasTracks 0.4% sales/use tax.
Updated annually, the Mid-term Financial Plan provides important cash flow planning information used to
determine the District’s operating, investing and financing activity as well as services that the District
can provide using projected financial resources. The first year of the Mid-term Financial Plan serves as
the basis for the preparation of the annual budget.
Each year during the planning process, operating costs are estimated and capital projects are developed
to support the goals and objectives of the District. Estimates of other expenditures, such as principal
and interest payments on long-term debt, are also developed as part of the overall costs to the District.
The other major component of the plans is the estimate of available revenues during the six-year time
period. These estimates of costs and revenues are brought together to insure that RTD will have
adequate resources to meet cash flow needs.
Per RTD’s Fiscal Policy Statement, RTD will contract with a qualified third party to provide sales and use
tax forecasting containing projections for the short term (annual budget), medium term (Mid-term

Packet Pg. 14

1.B.2

Financial Plan) and long term (Financial Plan). RTD has contracted with the University of Colorado-Leeds
School of Business for this service. See “sales and use tax” in Discussion below.
Capital and operating/maintenance projects are evaluated based on their relative costs and benefits,
relative need, and to what extent they meet the RTD mission statement and State of Good Repair
priorities. Projects are constrained to operate within the forecast of revenues and funding sources
available for their completion and operation.
The Mid-term Financial Plan also provides the basis for the District’s application for federal transit
funding through the Transportation Improvement Program (TIP), prepared by the Denver Regional Council
of Governments. The TIP is a list of all roadway and transit projects in the region that receive federal
funding. RTD cannot receive federal funds for projects unless the SBP/APE qualifying projects are
included in the TIP.
Projected Base and FasTracks future expense and projects for the period 2025-2040 are presented
separately in the Long-Range Financial Plan.
DISCUSSION
Base System
The attached Mid-term Financial Plan for the Base System incorporates the 2018 Amended Budget with
necessary adjustments and best estimates at this time. The Base System plan drafts were presented to
the Financial Administration and Audit Committee on May 15th and July 10th for discussion. The final
presentation follows in this document on October 9th with staff recommendation for Board adoption on
October 16th.
Exhibit I
Exhibit I (attached) summarizes the 2019-2024 projected cash flow through the extension of the
2018 Amended Budget. The column titled “Amended Budget 2018” in Exhibit I incorporates
revenue and expense adjustments approved in the Amended Budget and subsequent proposed
amendment.
The Base System plan is balanced through the six-year period after incorporating into the
projections:
1) March-2018 sales/use tax forecast from CU-Leeds School of Business
2) Minimum/must-have requested capital and expense projects approved in the previous year’s
plan with costs in outlying years, including fleet requirements
3) High priority new project requests within State of Good Repair parameters, including fleet
requirements
4) Reductions, eliminations or deferrals of non-critical requested projects
5) SOGR allowance in 2024
6) Use of previously-issued debt and internal funds to support planned fleet purchases
7) New COP (Certificates of Participation) financing issued in 2022 to support planned fleet
purchases
7) Contribution to reserve funds in total in 3 of the 6 years of the plan
8) No service reductions other than reprogrammed fixed route service through this period
Exhibit I summarizes the Base System 2019-2024 projected cash flow activity based on the staff
recommendation incorporating the following:

Packet Pg. 15

1.B.2

 Revenue estimates:
 Fare revenue of $125.3 million in 2019 is based on the recommended fare change
proposal presented by staff in September 2018 and adopted by the Board. Fare revenue
in 2019 is projected to be 8.8% above the 2018 budget per the recommendation. The
fare revenue through the six-year period is sourced from assumptions in the fare change
proposal. (Line 1)
 Sales and use tax incorporates the March-2018 semi-annual update from the CU-Leeds
School of Business for the years 2019-2024, plus an adjustment for reinstatement of
marijuana sales tax beginning in 2019. In all years of the Mid-term Financial plan, the
medium baseline forecast from CU is used. Of the total forecasted amounts, 0.6% is
apportioned to the Base System. (Line 2)
o The CU-Leeds forecast contains confidence bounds on total RTD revenues. The
mean forecast for 2018 is bracketed by 67% confidence bounds of $584.6 million
on the low side and $659.7 million for the upper bound (at 1% sales/use tax rate).
The upper bound estimate is 5.9% higher than the medium baseline forecast,
meaning that it is not impossible or unrealistic that revenue could grow somewhat
strongly over the next year. Likewise, economic threats pose downside risk to the
forecast, with a 6.1% lower bound. The values of the high and low forecast
bounds are computed as 67% confidence bounds, meaning that a 0.67 probability
exists that the interval between low and high forecast values will contain the actual
value of the variable being predicted.
 Grant revenue projected receipts are based upon past trends, formula allocations, known
proceeds, and recent congressional actions. Amounts are escalated at the area Consumer
Price Index (CPI) (obtained from Moody’s) or as identified. (Line 3)
 Other income consists of on-going advertising revenue, joint venture revenue, and IGA and
miscellaneous rental income, escalated at the CPI beginning in 2019. (Line 4)
 Operating expenses (excluding depreciation):
 Operating expenses are increased at area CPI rates and then adjusted for known items and
necessary reductions. The area CPI rates follow: (Line 6)
2019:
2.8%
2020:
2.7%
2021:
2.7%
2022:
2.6%
2023:
2.6%
2024:
2.6%
 Operating expenses include higher costs for purchased transportation contracts in all years
of the plan as various contracts are re-bid. The additional costs are estimated at
approximately $7.5 million each year beginning with 2019 and then escalated.
 Service increase consists of the cost of new CMAQ-funded service projects to be operated
by RTD in 2019 to include service enhancements on Routes L and 324, Route 73
extension, Superior and Broomfield call-n-Ride services, and Anschutz Medical Campus
Shuttle. These services are included in the DRCOG TIP. RTD costs will be reimbursed in
full by CMAQ grant funds and contributed funds from the applicable municipalities.
Determination will be made in future years whether to continue such service at RTD’s
cost. (Line 7)
 Costs of operating the West Line, R Line, DUS Bus Concourse, Free MetroRide, BRT, HLine extension, and SERE are allocated from Base to FasTracks based on resource drivers
on a full-allocation basis for all years of the plan. In addition, a portion of overhead costs

Packet Pg. 16

1.B.2








is also allocated for the Commuter Rail Lines. Thus, Base total expenses are reduced by
the amount of the allocation. Prior to 2017, the allocation was made on an incremental
basis; it was changed to full allocation including administrative and support costs
beginning in 2017. (Line 8)
 Expenses include the Collective Bargaining Agreement at a negotiated amount through
2020 and then escalated at the CPI rate for 2021-2024. (Line 9)
 Diesel fuel is forecast at an estimated lock price of $2.30/gallon in 2019 and then
escalated at the national CPI rates as follows: (Line 10)
2019:
2.5%
2020:
2.5%
2021:
2.3%
2022:
2.2%
2023:
2.3%
2024:
2.3%
 Gasoline is forecast at $2.65/gallon in 2019, which is same cost per gallon used in the
2018 budget, and then escalated at the national CPI rates above. (Line 10)
 The line item for expense projects (O&M) includes specifically identified minimum/musthave operating and maintenance projects approved in the previous year’s plan with costs
in outlying years, and high priority new project requests based on SOGR priorities. These
projects are detailed in Exhibit III. Other projects may be added based on available cash
flow if sales tax revenue improves or there are excess fund balances at year-end. Specific
projects will be determined from the deferred project list in Exhibit IV.
o It should be noted that included in the operating projects line item is an allocation to
FasTracks for certain projects that serve both the Base System and FasTracks. Also, a
SOGR allowance of $15.5 million is included in the year 2024. (Line 11)
 The FasTracks service increase, or “rubber tire” service based on the 2004 FasTracks
Financial Plan whereby FasTracks will fund enhanced bus service on the Base System,
increases by the CPI rate serially each year. (Line 12)
Interest income is based on current yields adjusted for expected changes in investable
balances and forecasted interest rates per forward rate curves. (Line 15)
Interest expense is calculated by individual debt instruments outstanding during each year by
1) using debt amortization schedules for current debt and 2) forecasting new interest expense
on anticipated new debt issued based on forward interest rate curves. (Line 16)
The line item for capital expenditures includes specifically identified minimum/must-have
capital projects approved in the previous year’s plan with costs in outlying years, plus the
minimum required new fleet, and high priority new project requests based on SOGR priorities,
detailed in Exhibit II. Dollar amounts of the new fleet are determined so as not to exceed cash
flow constraints determined in the plan model. Other projects may be added based on
available cash flow if sales tax revenue improves or there are excess fund balances at yearend. Specific projects will be determined from the deferred project list in Exhibit IV. (Line 19)
Regarding the Board-appropriated fund, capital replacement fund, and unrestricted operating
reserve:
 Staff recommends that the Board-appropriated fund be funded at a minimum of $3
million in 2019, partially drawn in 2020-2021 to help balance the Base System plan,
and funded again at $3 million each year 2022-2024. This fund is projected to reach a
balance of $22.8 million in 2024. (Lines 20 and 33)
 Staff recommends that the capital replacement fund not be funded until 2022 and then
at $3 million each year in 2022-2024. This fund is projected to reach a balance of
$9.0 million in 2024. Per the 2018 Amended Budget, the capital replacement fund

Packet Pg. 17

1.B.2










was drawn to zero in 2018 to support capital expenditures (fleet acquisition). (Lines
21 and 34)
 The Fiscal Policy Statement in Fund Balance Policy 4 allows for the designation of an
unrestricted operating fund used to respond to unanticipated events, including revenue
shortfalls. The unrestricted operating reserve was established in 2017 and funded
with available cash flow. Staff recommends that the unrestricted operating fund be
drawn in 2019, 2020 and minimally in 2023 to help balance the Base System plan,
and then funded with available cash flow in 2022 and 2024. The plan will apply
available dollars toward the operating fund such that it reaches $62.4 million in 2024.
(Lines 22 and 35)
 The total of these three funds is projected to be $94.2 million in 2024.
A transfer to FasTracks for Base System support of FasTracks operations is not anticipated to
be necessary over the course of this six-year plan. (Line 23)
Financing proceeds represent COPs issued for bus and light rail vehicle acquisition in
accordance with fleet schedules, net of grant funding and use of capital acquisition fund.
New debt issuance will become necessary in the plan. The combination of Base System fare
revenue revised downward and higher expenses from purchased transportation costs has
made the issuance of $23.1 million in new COPs likely in 2022. (Line 25)
Principal payments on debt are derived from individual debt instruments outstanding during
each year (for current debt and future debt) by using debt amortization schedules. Principal
payments are forecast on both existing and new debt balances. (Line 26)
Other line items consist of the roll-over of the unrestricted fund ending balance at 12/31/18,
estimated changes to restricted reserves, available project funds, and the use of previouslyissued COP-bond proceeds for future year capital expenditures. (Lines 29, 30, and 31)
The plan is balanced during the six-year period as shown by the positive unrestricted year-end
fund balance. The objective is to maintain a minimum unrestricted year-end fund balance of
$2 million each year through 2024 while supporting a minimum critical level of capital and
expense projects and building reserve fund balances. (Line 32)

As required by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), RTD must review its Mid-term Financial Plan for
any Title VI impacts (disproportionate impacts on minority and low income communities). Any service
changes specified in the plan will be reviewed for Title VI impacts during the service planning process
prior to final recommendations on service changes. For the capital component of the plan, Title VI
impacts are reviewed on improvements that are over and above the state-of-good-repair elements
(repairs, replacements and rehabilitations) of the capital program. The Title VI review will be provided
and a statement from the Planning Department to this effect is attached.
FasTracks
The underlying assumptions for the 2018 FasTracks plan are consistent with those used in the Base
System:
 Fare revenues are projected based on the fare structure changes approved by the Board in
September 2018, adding revenue for new lines at their projected opening dates.
 Sales and use tax projections for the 0.4% sales and use tax incorporate the March 2018
Leeds forecasts, adjusted for reinstatement of the sales tax on recreational marijuana.
 Grant revenues are based on existing grant agreements and past trends, adjusted at CPI as
appropriate.
 Additional fixed guideway grants are assumed beginning nine years after corridors enter
revenue service.
 Interest income on available balance is projected using the same methodology as for the Base
System.
 The cost allocations to FasTracks from the Base System and the FasTracks “rubber tire”
service increase feed directly from the Base System plan.
 Operating and maintenance costs for the Eagle Project are derived from the Concession
Agreement.
 Operating and maintenance costs for the North Metro project include startup costs to prepare
for revenue service under RTD operation.
 Annual allowance for major rehabilitation of corridors outside the Eagle Project are assumed at
0.3% of installed asset value, starting seven years after the corridors enter revenue service.
The total FasTracks project budget through 2020 included in the FasTracks plan is approximately $5.6
billion, and is unchanged from the 2017 plan. There was one minor change to the project-by-project
costs, to reflect a transfer of $250,000 from program-wide capital costs to the Southeast Rail Extension

Packet Pg. 19

1.B.2

to pay for artwork along the corridor that was not eligible for reimbursement under the federal grant.
Project-by-project costs are included as Exhibit VII.
Future implementation of projects not included in the current plan would require identification of funding
sources for construction and operations, and would require approval of the Board. Therefore, the
FasTracks plan is a dynamic tool, which is updated annually as projects move towards completion and
any changes approved by the Board are incorporated.
The projected FasTracks cash flow through 2024 shows revenues and accumulated fund balances
sufficient to cover expenditures. Therefore, the plan does not require funding from either the Base
System or the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) to support FasTracks corridor operations and
maintenance. The cash flow by year through 2024 is presented as Exhibit VIII.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The staff-recommended Mid-term Financial Plan provides RTD with a plan for maintaining a positive
unrestricted year-end fund balance in each year of the plan while growing reserve fund balances.
However, uncontrollable economic factors, such as sales tax revenue, cost of fuel, materials, and
supplies, as well as economic conditions will continue to have an impact on the plan, and may challenge
staff to present new options and solutions during the 2019 budget period.

ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors adopts the 2019-2024 Mid-term Financial Plan.
2. Defer the adoption of a 2019-2024 Mid-term Financial Plan to a later date. This is not
recommended because the Mid-term Financial Plan identifies the capital programs, expenditures,
and service guidelines for the 2019 budget process and adoption of the plan serves as a
confirmation of the Board of Directors' vision for the 2019 Budget.

Packet Pg. 20

1.B.2

Provide staff additional direction in the selection of assumptions for the projected 2019-2024 Mid-term
Financial Plan. This is not the desired action and will result in delay of the Mid-term Financial Plan
adoption and possible delay in the 2019 budget process.

Project Description
Real-Time Passenger Information (RTPI) provides RTD passengers with predictive
arrival times for their next bus. IT and Marketing are working toward providing
predictive arrival times for buses via three primary delivery systems: 1) General
Transit Feed Specification for Real Time or GTFS-RT (which feeds the information to
Google Maps and some third party application developers), 2) Passenger Information
Display (PID) signs, and 3) the RTD website. Additional funding will be required to
implement future phases of this project. This will include planning, design, and
development of a third party developer portal that will allow the open developer
community to access rich data based on APIs (application programming interface, as
opposed to the flat file/GTFS-RT protocol), and build interesting and contextually rich
applications for our ridership and trip planning components. Also integration with IVR
and RiderAlert data will require additional funding.

Project is the demolition of the existing 17 year old concrete highblocks and

Southwest Corridor. The existing highblocks are over 17 years old. Due to the high use
of magnesium chloride (MgCl) and age, the highblocks are rusting and the concrete is
cracking/breaking. They are very unsightly and are a blight on the neighborhood
which is going through a revitalization.
The proposed Cab Signaling project would enable RTD Light Rail Vehicles (LRVs) to
constantly display, on the dash of the cab, the maximum speed a train is permitted to
operate based on signal indications and track conditions ahead of the train. The
wayside signal logic transmits a 100 hertz pulsed signal into the rail using 7 unique
pulsed rates, each having a different speed limit associated with it. If an Operator fails
to comply to a reduced speed limit zone and begins braking within a predetermined
grace period, the LRV will automatically apply brakes and come to a complete stop.
The project costs are estimated to provide for new software and hardware for all of
our current LRV fleet. Additionally the project funds would provide for new signal
software for each of our existing corridors that currently have Automatic Train Stop
(ATS) functionality.

This hoist is an original hoist in the building. It has reached the end of its useful life

Project is to replace the bus wash at East Metro. Bus wash is 15 years old and will
have reached the end of its useful life. The bus wash is breaking down more
frequently and repair parts are getting more difficult to find.
The existing dry fire sprinkler piping is deteriorating. It is plumbed with a thin gauge
pipe that is subject to corrosion damage because of condensation in the piping
reacting with the air in the system. The piping, fittings, and other related material
required for system repairs are no longer available. RTD has a very limited stock of
these materials remaining. Deterioration will continue, so eventually spare material
will be unavailable. Renovating the existing dry fire sprinkler piping systems will
increase system reliability and safety for RTD now and in the future. Building
maintenance will be reduced as a result of a new dry fire sprinkler piping system
installation.

upgrading existing 100% outside air units to energy recovery units. The energy
recovery units will save energy but because they are larger equipment than the
existing MUAs, structural and ductwork modifications may be required to install them.
The energy code requirements will make it necessary to evaluate and remodel HVEC

Project is to replace four (4) makeup air units MAU-9, 10, 11, 12 serving the bus
storage area at the Platte facility. These makeup air units (MAUs) are beyond their
useful life. Maintenance is becoming increasingly more difficult due to the age of this
equipment. If the MAUs fail, ventilation and heating will be lost in that location. New
equipment will be more energy efficient technology. Current energy code
requirements may require upgrading existing 100% outside air units to energy
recovery units. The energy recovery units will save energy but because they are larger
equipment than the existing MAUs, structural and ductwork modifications may be
required to install them.

Particulate Sensors Replacement
with CO NO2 Sensors @ Platte

Location
Platte Division

Project Description
Project is to replace existing particulate sensors with CO NO2 sensors to monitor air
quality and activate ventilation systems at Platte facility. The existing building
automation system (BAS) monitors air quality in the bus parking garage using
particulate sensors. The particulate sensors send a signal to the BAS to activate
ventilation systems when a programmed level of particulates is reached. Particulate
sensor technology is outdated and no longer available for this application. The current
method of determining the concentration of tailpipe emissions is using a CO NO2
sensor. CO (carbon monoxide) and NO2 (nitrogen dioxide) are the main components
of bus exhaust. The existing particulate sensor technology is outdated, unreliable and
beyond its useful life.

Elati Light Rail Division

Project will replace/rebuild the existing inspection pits at East Metro. The existing
inspection pits are constructed of steel framing and grating. The steel is 40 years old
and is showing signs of metal fatigue. Eventually there will be failure in the steel
members. This steel is nearing the end of its useful life and the inspection pits need to
be replaced.
Project is to add a second floor mezzanine at the Elati Light Rail facility for training of
Rail Operations personnel. We are currently renting a double wide trailer used for
operator training purposes with no running water or adequate relief facilities. Utilizing
the unused space on the second floor of the Elati facility will eliminate the need for
construction of a separate building as was previously considered. It will also allow the
project to be completed in a more timely manner.

Security Command Center University Project

Location
Districtwide

Project Description
RTD owns a vacant 10,000 square foot facility which is located at the University
Station under the existing parking structure. This request is to relocate the existing
Security Command Center Operations to this location. This space is ideal for our needs
for many reasons, including its size, which is more than 4 times what is currently being
used. This space will also provide for the Map 21 recommendation of an (EOC)
Emergency Operations Center for the District. The facility will be designed primarily
as a Security Command Center, but also function as an EOC (Emergency Operating
Center). This design would greatly benefit the District's operating divisions by creating
a facility that could support and operate Light Rail Control, Bus Dispatch and the IT
Division during critical incidents. It would serve as a redundant common operating
facility in emergencies for all disciplines while under an EOC activation. The design will
allow for redundant face to face operations, should a large scale emergency occur.
The facility would also provide a large server room, designed to support both security
operations and corporate IT redundancies. The existing Security Command Center
would be re-purposed into the Transit Police Division as a “Field Operations” building
to consolidate services between the Transit Police Division, Allied Universal Security
and the Denver Police Department contracted police. The current view room would
be converted into a large conference and training room. The current server room
would be surrendered to the IT Division for continued use to support security and RTD
corporate networks.

Project Description
This project will include all of the downtown track and infrastructure from 7th Street
to 30th and Downing. This alignment is 24 years old and has been in service since
inception. For the most part this infrastructure has reached its potential lifespan.
There are several projects in place to make repairs and replace the worst of the
defects but an overall plan is needed to replace all track, turnout switches, street
crossings, concrete flat work, etc. Please see the attached report from MOW and SGR,
highlighting the condition of the infrastructure in the area. This is a six year plan. The
alignment will be divided into segments that can be completely refurbished within the
span of one construction season. Our estimates are at a cost of between $2,500,000$3,000,000 per year for 6 years.

of the total costs for this project would be grant-funded. The establishment of BRT in
the corridor would raise ridership from approximately 1,900 to approximately 5,000
daily weekday riders in 2035. Detailed cost estimates and design will be established
through environmental clearance and preliminary engineering ahead of construction.

Project Description
Over the last several years, the rail system has grown significantly. As the rail system
grows so does the need for additional staff to maintain safe operations and provide
timely and reliable service to our customer base. With the growth, we are requesting
7 new positions, to include 3 Signal Traction Power Maintainers, 1 Rail Laborer, and 3
LRT Field Supervisors. Rail Ops is responsible for 5 separate corridors including West,
Downtown, East, Southeast and Southwest. With the current staffing level, it is
difficult to support and provide a timely response for each corridor. The lack of
coverage has a direct impact on our response times to incidents such as mechanical
failures, passenger accidents, requested operator assitance, etc. As we move forward,
it is imperative to have the correct number of personnel in a position where they can
assist/respond when needed to avoid major delays and maintain the safety of our
alignment. Our headcount has not kept pace and does not account for the fact that
our infrastructure is aging and requires continuous maintenance/replacement.

Mariposa Light Rail Division The drainage issue is occurring at the loading dock where there has been a settling of
the slab and upheaval of the drainage pipe which has resulted in the storm water not
being able to have a negative slope back to the main storm drainage pipe. Water is
pooling in the vicinity (up to 3 feet at times) and in the winter it is causing ice buildup
at the loading dock which makes this issue also safety related.

Project Description
Request is for funding to join Utility Notification Center of Colorado. Contractors that
are going to excavate for any type project must call UNCC to request utility locates in
the area of their excavation. All members will get notified to locate their utilities. RTD
has many utilities across the district at bus parking areas, light rail lines and stations as
well as RTD owned facilities. It is required by law to be a member and in RTD's best
interest to prevent expensive repairs to possible damage to RTD utilities as well as the
down time it would cause.

RTD offers to its Riders a versatile online payment system called FlexPass. The
FlexPass program helps move people by providing a fiscally sustainable program for
RTD as well as to employees of participating employers, and it helps contribute to
overall customer satisfaction. The program’s flexible nature enables employees to
choose their service level, vary passes from month-to-month, and enter or leave the
program at any time. Plus, it offers incentives for employers and employees to
participate including a pre-tax option. The program accounts for approximately $4.5
million in annual revenue and it continues to experience growth each year. In March
2010, RTD contracted with 360Media in Englewood, CO to provide and administer an
eCommerce website to provide services to FlexPass business customers and their
employees. The term of the agreement was for two (2) contract years and three (3)
one (1) year options. In 2014, RTD exercised the final option to retain the services of
360Media. It was envisioned that this eCommerce website will be replaced by RTD’s
SmartMedia system and that this function will be brought in-house in the near future.
Unfortunately, this solution is not currently budgeted for or in the immediate Smart
Card plans for implementation. It will most likely be discussed in 2020. Historically this
program was funded through a Smart Card line item which is no longer available.

Request is for an increase for processing repairs to on-vehicle advertising direct
application advertisements. It is the intent of this project to create a single line item
for repairs to direct app advertisements in order to streamline the processing and
payment of invoices associated with these repairs. Currently, there is a multi-stream
process to request, track, process invoices, track repair and process payments for
these repairs. We are anticipating an increase to this O&M expense in the coming
years due to the anticipated increase in light rail vehicles to service the light rail
expansions.

After further analysis, it has been determined that the project will require $225,000 in
Operating and Maintenance Costs rather than the approved $75,000 in on-going
Operating and Maintenance. The additional funds are necessary because the cost of
the product is higher than we originally scoped. In addition, it has come to light that
there is a need for a new email service and text messaging provider in order to send
out the customized, targeted messages to riders. We are resubmitting this request to
ask for additional Operating and Maintenance funds to maintain and build upon the
product going forward. Communications is looking to implement a Rider Alert System
in order to communicate up-to-the-minute service alerts for our riders in timely
manner. The system will include a web-based interface that allows staff to create and
manage the thousands of service alerts that are sent out each year. The Alerts System
will be intuitive and fast to use, allowing simple alerts to be created in seconds. At the
same time, the system will offer fine grained control over selecting the specific route,
branch, trip, or stop an alert applies to, when an alert is in effect, and by what
channels (like emails, text messages, electronic signs, agency website, General Transit
Feed Specification real-time feeds and third party apps) the alerts should be
disseminated. The system will use templates to automatically generate appropriate
messages for all the dissemination channels.

This project will implement a District-wide comprehensive Enterprise Content
Management (ECM) solution to consolidate identified existing systems that create,
capture or store content at RTD to create a single point of access. The project scope
will include the development of policies, procedures, taxonomy and metadata for the
consistent identification, use, maintenance, retrieval, retention, and destruction of
data. The project also will include identification of personnel and tools required to
implement the policies and procedures, implementation of the system, and the
development of training and audit tools to support the ongoing utilization of the
system. The current project cost estimate beyond the approved scope for IQBG
assumes that RTD will own and maintain the hardware and software in-house. As part
of its scope, IQBG will recommend a path forward for procurement of ECM tools,
which could include externally hosted systems or software-as-a-service (SaaS) systems
instead of in-house tools. If a hosted or SaaS system is selected, the cost structure of
the project and future staffing levels will change.

The proposed project would allow the Legal Services division (“RTD Law”), which
functions as RTD’s in-house law firm, to come into compliance with its legal and
ethical obligations. There are three components: (1) secure management and sharing
of legal records along with case management of those legal matters; (2) docketing and
calendaring of court-mandated deadlines; and (3) collection, review and production of
electronically stored information (“ESI”) for purposes of executing and enforcing legal
holds and producing documents in litigation and in response to other requests.

TrapezeCOM has been the only customer complaint and commendation tracking tool
in use for the past 8 years at RTD and most departments find it difficult to use and
limited in its functionality. Various departments/projects like Communications,
FasTracks, and the SmartCard system use their own customer issue
tracking/management tools to collect customer data and feedback that is not
integrated. Reporting from TrapezeCOM is also not conducive to the needs of the
District. Customer Care and other departments, including Legal, are unable to pull
reports to view a customer's overall interaction/relationship with RTD. In addition, the
current system has no analytics capabilities, so we are unable to pull reports to
understand complaints about specific routes, lines, stops, etc. The recommendation
from some of the studies like the SmartCard Business Process Re-engineering (SMT
BPR) and Fare Systems visioning exercise was that RTD procure and implement an
Enterprise Level CRM system that would meet the needs of all departments and
projects. The first phase (2018) of this project is to implement a contact center
customer relationship management tool for servicing customer needs and to replace
the TrapezeCOM functionality as a customer service case management need. The
future phases (2019 and beyond) will be to integrate and implement the service
module to other needs of the RTD district towards marketing/sales.

Oracle E-business suite support will end in 2021. RTD would need to upgrade to the
next version starting 2019 or start looking at alternatives in 2018. Project is to
implement the future of business applications such as finance, HR, procurement,
recruitment, and so on. The project will assess the need to upgrade existing
technologies and/or investigate/implement new technologies for these business
functions. The project will analyze the need to move/segregate the business functions
as necessary in order to upgrade existing application or move to the cloud or SAAS

Real-Time Passenger Information (RTPI) provides RTD passengers with predictive
arrival times for their next bus. IT and Marketing are working toward providing
predictive arrival times for buses via three primary delivery systems: 1) General
Transit Feed Specification for Real Time or GTFS-RT (which feeds the information to
Google Maps and some third party application developers), 2) Passenger Information
Display (PID) signs, and 3) the RTD website. Additional funding will be required to
implement future phases of this project. This will include planning, design, and
development of a third party developer portal that will allow the open developer
community to access rich data based on APIs (application programming interface, as
opposed to the flat file/GTFS-RT protocol), and build interesting and contextually rich
applications for our ridership and trip planning components. Also integration with IVR
and RiderAlert data will require additional funding.

RTD’s Rider Alert system is being replaced in late 2018/early 2019 with a much more
intuitive and robust system that allows for much more detailed and refined alerts to
subscribers, including down to a route/block/stop level. With this new system, RTD
will be able to communicate information related to dropped trips, detours by
impacted stops, disruptions by rail station, etc. Customer Care’s Digital Customer
Relations Liaison team will assume responsibility for increased outbound
communication to passengers, and will also assume responsibility from Bus Ops
Dispatch on certain detours and planned disruptions. With the addition of two FTE,
the team will now be at six and will need a Lead/Supervisor rather than reporting
directly to the Senior Manager of Customer Care.

In an age where organizations across markets and industries depend heavily on
technology to operate successfully, the IT Auditor plays an increasingly important role
in helping to manage and respond to risks. Information Technology (IT) Audit was
introduced in 2015 to ensure that RTD was prepared for the current global scenario of
Information Technology. IT Audit was introduced with Board of Directors support, but
the resources that accommodate the successful introduction and ensure efficient and
effective work are still needed. This request will ensure that RTD Audit has the
resources needed to provide assurance on the protection of assets, data integrity,

Security Command Center University Project

Project Description
RTD currently owns a vacant 10,000 square foot facility which is located at the
University Station under the existing parking structure. This request is to relocate the
existing Security Command Center Operations to this location. We feel this space is
ideal for our needs for many reasons, including its size, which is more than 4 times
what is currently being used. This space will also provide for the Map 21
recommendation of an (EOC) Emergency Operations Center for the District. The
facility will be designed primarily as a Security Command Center, but also function as
an EOC (Emergency Operating Center). This design would greatly benefit the District's
operating divisions by creating a facility that could support and operate Light Rail
Control, Bus Dispatch and the IT Division during critical incidents. It would serve as a
redundant common operating facility in emergencies for all disciplines while under an
EOC activation. The design will allow for redundant face to face operations, should a
large scale emergency occur. The facility would also provide a large server room,
designed to support both security operations and corporate IT redundancies. The
existing Security Command Center would be re-purposed into the Transit Police
Division as a “Field Operations” building to consolidate services between the Transit
Police Division, Allied Universal Security and the Denver Police Department contracted
police. The current view room would be converted into a large conference and
training room. The current server room would be surrendered to the IT Division for
continued use to support security and RTD corporate networks.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
adopts the 2018 Long Range Financial Plan.
This Recommended Action supports the General Manager’s Goals for 2018:
Core Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management
Task Goal #1 – Fiscal Sustainability
BACKGROUND
The RTD Long Range Financial Plan serves as an extension of the six-year Mid-term Financial Plan
through the regional planning time horizon, which is currently 2040. This plan is submitted to the
Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) for inclusion in the Regional Transportation Plan
(RTP), and projects must be included in order to receive federal funding. RTD’s lenders also utilize the
plan to ensure that RTD has the financial capacity to repay its debt.
DISCUSSION
The Long Range Financial Plan focuses on ensuring that RTD can fund the ongoing operation and
maintenance of the Base System and the FasTracks corridors while repaying its debt obligations. Key
elements of the plan for the years 2025-2040 include the following:






Base System Operations and Capital Replacement
o Continued operating costs based on the final year of the SBP, escalated at the Consumer
Price Index (CPI)
o Annual allowance for major rehabilitation assumed based on 0.5% of installed cost of
existing asset inventory, escalated at CPI
o Additional service for the SH 119 project at its completion
o Replacement of revenue fleet and other assets based on current asset inventory and
replacement schedules, adjusted for major assets purchased in the SBP period
o Replacement of a maintenance facility in 2025 to meet projected capacity needs
FasTracks Operations and Capital Maintenance
o Cost allocations from the Base System based on the final year of the SBP, escalated at the
Consumer Price Index (CPI)
o FasTracks-funded rubber tire service increase based on the final year of the SBP, escalated
at the Consumer Price Index (CPI)
o Eagle operating and maintenance costs derived from the Concession Agreement
o North Metro operations and maintenance costs for RTD operations, escalated at CPI
o Annual allowance for major rehabilitation of corridors outside the Eagle Project assumed at
0.3%-0.5% of installed asset value based on age of corridor, escalated at CPI
Revenue Projections

Packet Pg. 50

1.B.3

Sales and use tax forecasts from the March 2018 Leeds forecasts, adjusted for
reinstatement of the sales tax on recreational marijuana
o Farebox revenues forecasts based on the 2019 fare change adopted by the Board in
September 2018
o Fare increases tied to the CPI assumed every third year
o Future formula grants forecast based on historic appropriations, escalated at CPI
o Additional fixed guideway grants assumed for FasTracks corridors beginning nine years
after corridors enter revenue service
FasTracks corridor construction
o Additional projects to meet commitments included in the environmental clearances for
federally-funded corridors
o



Exhibit I shows the projected cash flow for the Base System and FasTracks by 5-6 year increments
through the year 2040, including the current projections from the mid-term financial plan. The plan
shows positive fund balances on both the base system and FasTracks in every year through 2040.







No base system funding required to fund FasTracks expenditures; FasTracks is expected to be
fully funded from its own revenue streams
Need to issue COPs to finance selected Base System capital expenditures
o Bus maintenance facility in 2025
o Bus purchases in 2028
No additional COPs issued to finance FasTracks expenditures
Increase combined Board appropriated and operating reserves on Base System to reach three
months’ operating expenses by 2029
Maintain a balance of three months’ operating expenses in the combined Board appropriated
reserve, operating reserve, and the capital acquisition fund on FasTracks
Short-term use of FISA to fund FasTracks operations and maintenance in 2027
o Full balance restored to FISA in 2028

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The recommended Long Range Financial Plan provides RTD with the means to maintain its current
system in a state of good repair through 2040. Between 2025 and 2028, RTD would not have the
capacity for service expansion or new projects beyond those needed for state of good repair, and the
FISA would not be sufficient to fund the unfunded FasTracks corridors.
Beginning in 2029, positive unrestricted fund balances begin to accumulate on both the Base System
and FasTracks, in addition to the balance in the FISA. Funding from the FISA and the unrestricted fund
balances on FasTracks would be used to fund the remaining unfunded FasTracks corridors, which have
not been prioritized.

Pension

Plan

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
adopt a 2019 contribution of $5.1 million to RTD’s Salaried Employees’ Defined Benefit Pension Trust
(the “DB Plan”), which pays a specified monthly benefit at retirement. It is also recommended that the
RTD Board of Directors adopt a 2019 contribution of 9% of each participant’s eligible compensation to
the Salaried Employees’ Defined Contribution Plan (the “DC Plan”), which contributes a specified amount
to the plan for each year of employment.
General Manager’s Goals:
 Task Goal #2 – Workforce and Human Capital
BACKGROUND
In December, 2007, the RTD Board of Directors closed the DB Plan to new employees with new
employees hired on January 1, 2008 and later participating in the DC Plan. From January 1, 2008 to
December 31, 2012 both the DB and DC Plan had been funded on a 9% of salaries basis.
DISCUSSION
DB Plan
In 2012, the Board of Directors agreed that beginning in 2013, annual contributions to the DB Plan
would be made at a fixed annual amount of $3.1 million rather than as a percentage of salaries as a
result of the actuary’s recommendation at that time. The fixed annual contribution of $3.1 million to the
DB Plan was determined by the plan’s actuaries to be the annual contribution necessary to maintain a
“fully funded” status for the plan in the future.
The actuaries have updated the DB Plan projections to reflect the final 1/1/2018 valuation assumptions
for the DB Plan. The 2019 Actuary recommended contribution is $7.3 million. If RTD contributed $5.1
million in 2019, 100% funding could be reached in 2031 with recommended contributions dropping
below $5.1 million in 2022. This also assumes an annual rate of return of 7.5% per year.
The recommendation is to keep the annual fixed contribution at $5.1 million for 2019.
DC Plan
Section 4.1 of the RTD Salaried Employees’ DC Plan adopted by the RTD Board provides that the
Employer may, at its sole discretion, set a contribution rate between 7 to 9% per year for participants.
The contribution rate has been 9% each year to the DC Plan from 2008 through 2018.

ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors adopt a 2019 contribution of $5.1 million to RTD’s Salaried Employees’ Defined Benefit
Pension Trust (the “DB Plan”), which pays a specified monthly benefit at retirement. It is also
recommended that the RTD Board of Directors adopt a 2019 contribution of 9% of each
participant’s eligible compensation to the Salaried Employees’ Defined Contribution Plan (the “DC
Plan”), which contributes a specified amount to the plan for each year of employment.
2. The RTD Board of Directors could certify an amount to be contributed to the RTD Salaried
Employees’ Defined Benefit Pension Trust or the RTD Salaried Employees’ Defined Contribution
Plan at amounts other than $5.1 million and 9%, respectively.
3. Do not authorize a contribution to the RTD Salaried Employees’ Pension Plans. This is not
recommended because the DB Plan’s funding status would deteriorate and the liability would
increase.

2019

Benefit

Plan

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approves the 2019 Plan Year Salaried Benefits plan and authorizes the General Manager/CEO or his
designee to enter into agreements with the insurance carriers.
General Manager’s Goals:
 Task Goal #2 – Workforce and Human Capital
BACKGROUND
Annually the staff brings the proposed Salaried Employee Benefits plan for approval to the Board of
Directors. Approval of the plan by the Board establishes the rates for Open Enrollment and provides
costs for the 2019 Budget. The Open Enrollment period for salaried staff begins November 4 through
November 19, 2018.
DISCUSSION
The goals for the 2019 plan year are: 1) Achieve the 2019 budget goals, 2) Continued focus on
containing cost and emphasis on improving health and wellness consumerism, 3) Maintain market
competitiveness, and 4) Insure compliance with PPACA – Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
(Health Care Reform provisions as applicable to RTD). Following is a summary of the changes for the
2019 plan year.
Based on input from the Board in 2016, the Benefits Committee reviewed the medical premiums and
RTD/ employee share of the premium payment. The Benefits Committee is moving toward the less
expensive plans, Kaiser, as being the base plans to which employees would buy up for Cigna. In year
two, 2019, premiums for participants on the CIGNA HDHP and PPO plans, will be calculated as follows:


Cigna participants will pay 55% of the difference in premium between the Cigna plan and a like
Kaiser plan. This is an increase of 22% over the employee premium calculation for 2018.

Medical
 Kaiser HDHP
o No plan changes
 Kaiser DHMO
o Increased Deductibles
 Individual from $800 to $1000
 Family from $1,600 to $2,000
 Cigna HDHP
o Add Cigna 90 Now
 Participants on maintenance medication, previously only a 90 day mail order, may

now pick up their 90 day supply of medication at CVS, Walmart and King Soopers/
City Market.


Cigna PPO
o Add Cigna 90 Now
 Participants on maintenance medication, previously only a 90 day mail order, may
now pick up their 90 day supply of medication at CVS, Walmart and King Soopers/
City Market, for two co-pays

Dental


The plan benefits have been updated to mirror recent changes in ADA recommendations, the
addition of implants to the PPO plan and some minor co-pay changes to the EPO plan. Based on
anticipated claims, we expect about a 6% increase in premium over LY.

Life & Disability


Due to poor customer service to participants, these coverage were sent out to bid for 2019. The
benefits committee saw presentations from Unum and Lincoln, the two lowest cost providers
from a field of four and determined to engage Unum to provide Life and Disability coverages for
2019.

Vision/Business Travel Accident



No changes in rates or plan for the vision plan in 2019
Business/ Travel Accident insurance, no increase in premium.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The 2019 planned Salaried Employee Benefit budget is projected to be -1.15% below the 2018
projected benefit costs.
The reduction in the cost to RTD is directly related to the following:
 Minimal increase in premium on the Cigna plans
 Increased percent of employee premium for the Cigna plans.
 Rate guarantee for Vision plan
The 2019 estimate of the Salaried Employee Insured Benefits is $11,308,328.77.
decrease of 1.15% results in a projected decrease of $129,812.18 to the budget.

The projected

For 2019, the benefit costs meet the projected costs in the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP).

based on 2018 and 2019 estimated claims and current enrolled employees.
**2019 PCOR Fees have not been announced by the IRS, estimate a 5% Increase over 2018
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Director approves the 2019 Plan Year Salaried Benefits plan and authorizes the General
Manager/CEO or his designee to enter into agreements with the insurance carriers.
2. Further modify the salaried employee benefit plans to be offered in 2019. This is not
recommended since it would require additional negotiations with benefit providers and delay the
employee enrollment period.
3. Do not approve the recommended salaried employee benefit plans. This is not recommended, as
this will result in the organization being unable to provide competitive and cost effective benefit
plans to the salaried employees.

Adoption of the Fiscal Policy

CFO/AGM,

Date: October 3, 2018
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: October 16, 2018

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approves and adopts the revised Fiscal Policy Statement for 2019.
General Manager’s Goals
Core Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management
Task Goal #1 – Fiscal Sustainability
BACKGROUND
Proposed modifications to the Fiscal Policy Statement (the “Policy”) are brought to the Board of
Directors for approval during the year, as necessary. In addition, each year staff presents the proposed
Policy for development of the upcoming year’s budget.
The most recent modification to the Policy was approved by the Board of Directors in November 2017
for the 2018 fiscal year. Those changes were related to 1) wording clarification, consisting of reference
to the APE where necessary, 2) the substitution of the word “monetize” for “sell” in Revenue Policies
#6, and 3) Debt Policies #5 were updated with the most recent rating agency credit ratings in effect at
that date.
DISCUSSION
For 2019, the following changes are proposed:
1) Re-write of the Investment Policies section to read, “RTD financial assets are managed in accordance
with the RTD Investment Policy Statement which is reviewed and approved by the RTD Board on an
annual basis.”
2) Wording clarification consisting of substitution of the words “Mid-Term Financial Plan” for Strategic
Budget Plan (SBP and Annual Program Evaluation (APE) where necessary.
Please see the attachments for the full proposed document and document with changes indicated.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Adopting the Fiscal Policy Statement changes as requested will not have a financial impact on the 2019
Recommended Budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors approves and adopts the revised Fiscal Policy Statement for 2019.

Packet Pg. 61

1.B.6

2. Board of Directors further modifies the recommended changes.
3. Do not adopt the RTD 2019 Fiscal Policy Statement. This is not recommended because RTD’s
Fiscal Policy Statement would not contain all current language, would not adhere to best
practices, and would not best facilitate the needs of RTD’s financial operations.

2019 FISCAL POLICY STATEMENT

1. Staff will plan fare adjustments every three years in the mid and long-term budgets
to adjust for inflation. The Board of Directors may consider potential fare
adjustments annually at the time of the development of the Mid-Term Financial Plan.
As part of this process, staff will review potential fare adjustments to establish a
fare structure to ensure that it:
 is understandable
 is implementable
 is equitable
 achieves revenue levels established in the Mid-Term Financial Plan
2. Fare policies will take into account the special needs of all transit dependent patrons.
3. RTD will avoid dependence on temporary revenues to fund ongoing services. Onetime revenues will be used for one-time expenditures.
4. RTD will continuously explore additional sources of revenue to help balance the
budget.
5. When appropriate the Board will actively pursue legislation that would help ensure
the continued accomplishment of RTD’s goals and mission statement. The Board
will support efforts to ensure that legislative intent is realized in allocation of state
financial resources to public transit. The Board will actively oppose legislation that
would limit or diminish revenue.
6. On an annual basis, staff will identify under- or un-utilized property and equipment,
and will make an ongoing attempt to monetize such property and equipment to
enhance cash flow.
7. RTD will contract with a qualified third party to provide sales and use tax forecasting
containing projections for the short-term (one year by quarter), mid-term (six-year
SBP and APE period) and long-term (30-year Financial Plan period). The purpose is
to provide RTD with expert economic analysis and sales and use tax forecasts using
sophisticated financial modeling techniques not available internally.

effectiveness through ease of use and improved travel times.
2. RTD will continue to look for and implement the most cost-effective and reliable
methods of delivering transportation services.
3. RTD will endeavor to maintain its assets at a level that protects capital investment
and minimizes future maintenance and replacement costs.
4. RTD maintains a risk management program which will provide protection against loss
and mitigate exposure to liability.
5. A safety program will be maintained to minimize RTD's exposure to liability and
thereby reduce the number of claims against RTD. RTD will invest in safety outreach
programs and personnel to communicate safety messages.
6. RTD will develop service changes that are needed to respond to budget shortfalls
using the system-wide and route-specific productivity measures that have been
approved by the Board.

CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT POLICIES
1. On an annual basis, RTD will prepare and update a six-year Mid-Term Financial Plan
including projected capital construction and improvements, service levels, operating
costs, and revenues to fund the capital and operating programs. Capital projects to
be included in the Mid-Term Financial Plan will be evaluated using the following
criteria:
 total project cost (design and construction) and schedule for completion;
 source of funding;
 operating and maintenance costs for the remainder of the SBP period;

to the effect on future operating and maintenance costs, economy, service, and

consideration of alternatives (joint development, etc.); consequences of not
funding; and

criteria.

2. Priority will be given to replacement of existing assets before consideration of new
assets except as allowed for in the FasTracks APE and/or financial plan (see #7
below).
3. RTD will use the first year capital program from the adopted Mid-Term Financial Plan
as the basis for the capital program to be included in the annual budget.
4. After completion of design of a capital project, cost estimates will be revised. If the
cost estimates exceed Delegation of Authority limits, the project will be brought to
the Board for reconsideration.
5. Facilities will be designed using current technology and allow for future technological
changes in order to be efficient and cost-effective and to protect the public welfare.
6. RTD shall allow for multi-year capital projects to be carried forward in accordance
with the carry-forward resolution adopted by the Board.
7. RTD will prepare an annual update of the FasTracks APE which will be integrated
with the SBP into the Mid-Term Financial Plan incorporating the actual costs incurred
and the most recent available projections of capital improvement costs, service
levels, and operating costs and revenues to fund the FasTracks capital and operating
programs.

FUND BALANCE POLICIES
1. RTD will strive to maintain a fund balance in the Base System and FasTracks to
provide for unanticipated expenditures of a nonrecurring nature, to meet unexpected
increases in costs or to mitigate service disruptions as a result of economic
downturns affecting revenue. The Base System should strive to maintain a total
fund balance at an amount approximately equal to three months of Base System
operating expenses excluding depreciation among the following three reserve funds:
the Board-appropriated fund, the unrestricted operating reserve, and the remaining
unrestricted fund balance. For FasTracks, the total of the Board-appropriated fund
and unrestricted fund balance should be maintained at an amount approximately
3
Packet Pg. 65

Attachment: 2019 Fiscal Policy Statement (3596 : Adoption of the Fiscal Policy)



1.B.6.a

Fiscal Policy Statement - effective October 16, 2018

equal to three months of FasTracks operating expenses excluding depreciation. RTD
will consider and pursue resources that will be directed to fund balance
replenishment. For example, non-recurring revenues and budget surpluses are an
especially appropriate source for replenishing fund balance.

2. In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will designate a Board-appropriated
fund balance on an annual basis. Use of the fund balance will be minimized and
occur only in specific circumstances such as economic downturns. With Board
approval, these funds may be used to avoid cash flow interruptions, reduce the need
for short-term borrowing, and assist in maintaining an investment-grade bond rating.
The source of replenishment of this fund will be identified and replenishment will
take place in a prompt manner.
3. In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will designate a capital replacement
fund on an annual basis. With Board approval, these funds will be used for scheduled
major vehicle replacements and other capital purchases.
The source of
replenishment of this fund will be identified and replenishment will take place in a
prompt manner.
4. In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will designate an unrestricted operating
reserve on an annual basis. Use of the fund balance will be to mitigate service or
project disruptions due to revenue fluctuations, unanticipated expenditures of a
nonrecurring nature, or to avoid cash flow disruptions. The source of replenishment
of this fund will be identified and replenishment will take place in a prompt manner.
5. RTD will maintain an emergency (TABOR) reserve equal to three percent of nonFederal revenues, as specified by Article X, Section 20 of the Colorado Constitution.
6. The Board shall establish a reserve for future construction under the FasTracks plan:
 The FasTracks Management Reserve will be appropriated at a sufficient level each
year to fund adjustments to the FasTracks construction schedule, relating to
logistics or cost savings opportunities that might arise after the annual budget is
adopted, and will not be used to fund the (non-FasTracks) Base System capital
or operating activity.
7. The FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) will be used to provide funding to
complete and operate additional FasTracks projects. Expenditures from the FISA will
be subject to Board approval. Funding of the FISA will be provided from the sources
identified in the Board approved Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM) and other sources
approved by the Board.
4
Packet Pg. 66

Attachment: 2019 Fiscal Policy Statement (3596 : Adoption of the Fiscal Policy)

RTD will replenish fund balances as soon as economic conditions allow.

1.B.6.a

Fiscal Policy Statement - effective October 16, 2018

8. All other FasTracks funds which have not been appropriated, or otherwise
designated as reserved, in the current budget year will be maintained in a reserve for
future FasTracks capital and operating expenditures and will not be used to fund the
(non-FasTracks) Base System expenditures.

1. Debt financing will not be issued to support operating expenditures.
2. Capital projects funded through the issuance of bonds, Certificates of Participation
(COPs) or other financial obligations shall be financed for a period not to exceed the
lesser of the expected useful life of the asset or a maximum of 40 years.
3. Effective communication with credit rating agencies will be maintained, and a policy
of full disclosure on every financial report and official statement will be followed.
4. Before long-term debt is issued, the impact of debt service on total annual
expenditures and the net revenue coverage ratio will be analyzed.
5. It is the intent of RTD to maintain a high quality investment-grade credit rating. The
benefit of maintaining RTD's credit ratings at the highest reasonably attainable level
in light of current economic conditions and availability of capital funding is to receive
lower interest rates and lower debt insurance premiums than would be possible with
lower credit ratings. RTD’s current ratings are listed below:

FUND BALANCE POLICIES
1. RTD will strive to maintain a fund balance in the Base System and FasTracks to
provide for unanticipated expenditures of a nonrecurring nature, to meet unexpected
increases in costs or to mitigate service disruptions as a result of economic
downturns affecting revenue. The Base System should strive to maintain a total
fund balance at an amount approximately equal to three months of Base System
operating expenses excluding depreciation among the following three reserve funds:
the Board-appropriated fund, the unrestricted operating reserve, and the remaining
unrestricted fund balance. For FasTracks, the total of the Board-appropriated fund
and unrestricted fund balance should be maintained at an amount approximately
equal to three months of FasTracks operating expenses excluding depreciation. RTD
will consider and pursue resources that will be directed to fund balance
replenishment. For example, non-recurring revenues and budget surpluses are an
especially appropriate source for replenishing fund balance.
RTD will replenish fund balances as soon as economic conditions allow.
2. In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will designate a Board-appropriated
fund balance on an annual basis. Use of the fund balance will be minimized and
occur only in specific circumstances such as economic downturns. With Board
approval, these funds may be used to avoid cash flow interruptions, reduce the need
for short-term borrowing, and assist in maintaining an investment-grade bond rating.
The source of replenishment of this fund will be identified and replenishment will
take place in a prompt manner.
3. In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will designate a capital replacement
fund on an annual basis. With Board approval, these funds will be used for scheduled
major vehicle replacements and other capital purchases.
The source of
replenishment of this fund will be identified and replenishment will take place in a
prompt manner.
4. In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will designate an unrestricted operating
reserve on an annual basis. Use of the fund balance will be to mitigate service or
project disruptions due to revenue fluctuations, unanticipated expenditures of a
nonrecurring nature, or to avoid cash flow disruptions. The source of replenishment
of this fund will be identified and replenishment will take place in a prompt manner.
5. RTD will maintain an emergency (TABOR) reserve equal to three percent of nonFederal revenues, as specified by Article X, Section 20 of the Colorado Constitution.

6. The Board shall establish a reserve for future construction under the FasTracks plan:
 The FasTracks Management Reserve will be appropriated at a sufficient level each
year to fund adjustments to the FasTracks construction schedule, relating to
logistics or cost savings opportunities that might arise after the annual budget is
adopted, and will not be used to fund the (non-FasTracks) Base System capital
or operating activity.
7. The FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) will be used to provide funding to
complete and operate additional FasTracks projects. Expenditures from the FISA will
be subject to Board approval. Funding of the FISA will be provided from the sources
identified in the Board approved Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM) and other sources
approved by the Board.
8. All other FasTracks funds which have not been appropriated, or otherwise
designated as reserved, in the current budget year will be maintained in a reserve for
future FasTracks capital and operating expenditures and will not be used to fund the
(non-FasTracks) Base System expenditures.

DEBT POLICIES
1. Debt financing will not be issued to support operating expenditures.
2. Capital projects funded through the issuance of bonds, Certificates of Participation
(COPs) or other financial obligations shall be financed for a period not to exceed the
lesser of the expected useful life of the asset or a maximum of 40 years.
3. Effective communication with credit rating agencies will be maintained, and a policy
of full disclosure on every financial report and official statement will be followed.
4. Before long-term debt is issued, the impact of debt service on total annual
expenditures and the net revenue coverage ratio will be analyzed.
5. It is the intent of RTD to maintain a high quality investment-grade credit rating. The
benefit of maintaining RTD's credit ratings at the highest reasonably attainable level
in light of current economic conditions and availability of capital funding is to receive
lower interest rates and lower debt insurance premiums than would be possible with
lower credit ratings. RTD’s current ratings are listed below:

Contract

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to increase the
contract authority for the Enghouse contract by $499,055 making the total contract value $1,510,340.
General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services
BACKGROUND
RTD implemented the Interactive Voice Response (IVR) for both the Telephone Information Center and
Access-a-Ride to enhance the efficiency of the services being provided. The IVR technology enables
interaction between the caller and the RTD scheduling system. Callers interact by pressing numbers on
the telephone keypad or by speaking simple voice commands to answer computer voice prompts. The
IVR reduces the number of calls handled by agents by approximately 2,000 plus calls per day; thus,
achieving cost savings to the District. Without the IVR, the Telephone Information Center (TIC) would
require an additional headcount of 12-15 agents. IVR technology is commonly found in call centers to
improve customer service and reduce operational costs.
Benefits of the IVR system include:
 Improved customer service; callers avoiding hold times
 Approximately 2,000 plus calls per day processed through the IVR system
 Fewer headcount to answer inbound calls; cost savings
 Access-a-Ride has fewer “no shows” with the IVR sending reminder calls and the ability of riders
to cancel trips in advance – cost savings to RTD
Fixed Route IVR was implemented in July 2016 the Access-a-Ride IVR was implemented in October
2017.
DISCUSSION
On December 11, 2012 the Board approved the original Enghouse contract in the amount of $829,393.
The GM has exercised his authority of $200,000 (approximately $18,108 remains of GM’s authority).
The Board is requested to increase the contract authority by an additional $480,947.
The increase to contract authority will allow for enhancements and option years to extended warranty
for the IVR system to include:

The enhancement being requested are from the paratransit community to improve the usability of the
IVR system. The option years are for ongoing maintenance and support of the Enghouse IVR system.
Without the maintenance and support option years, RTD would be required to support the system which
would be costly and potentially required additional staffing to meet the support demands of the system.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The contract authority shall not exceed $1,510,880. Funding for the increase in contract authority exists
in the capital project budget. Additional funding is not required.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to increase
the contract authority for the Enghouse contract by $499,055 making the total contract value
$1,510,340.
2. Do not increase contract authority for Enghouse resulting in no enhancements requested by the
paratransit community, discontinued support and maintenance of both Fixed Route and
Paratranist IVR.

Board Meeting Date: October 16, 2018

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Finance Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager and his designees to negotiate and execute all documents necessary to
resolve Regional Rail Partners North Metro Project claims, as outlined in the settlement memorandum
prepared at the conclusion of the parties’ September 20, 2018 mediation; and to authorize use of the
FasTracks Management Reserve to fund the first disbursement of funds in the amount of $15 million.
General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #1: Successful Delivery of Transit Services
BACKGROUND
RTD’s North Metro Project is an approximately $390 million project involving the design and
construction of RTD’s North Metro commuter rail line to Thornton. In 2013, RTD received an unsolicited
proposal providing the opportunity to build most of the North Metro commuter rail line. RTD evaluated
the proposal and issued an RFP in the summer of 2013. Two teams bid on the RFP. In November 2013,
RTD awarded a contract to Regional Rail Partners (RRP) – a consortium currently led by Graham
Contracting Ltd. and Balfour Beatty, Inc. – to design and build the N Line from Union Station to Eastlake
& 124th. Since the award, RTD has granted RRP an additional $45,821,165 in contract directives and
change orders, resulting in a current contract value of $389,116,020. To date, RTD has paid RRP
$315,538,498 for completed work.
RTD and RRP were unable to reach agreement as to additional change orders requested by RRP, in
particular for delay, direct costs, acceleration and interest related to Burlington Northern & Santa Fe
Railroad (BNSF) and other third-party approvals of design, and disputes regarding acquisition of property.
Under the dispute resolution provisions of the contract, RTD and RRP agreed to arbitrate RRP’s claims as
of October 2017 to a three-arbitrator panel. The arbitration is scheduled for three weeks in late
November 2018, and would only resolve RRP’s claims up to October 2017. RRP’s claim totaled
$47,323,359 plus attorney fees and costs.
The parties engaged in extensive discovery to prepare for arbitration; in the meantime, the parties
continued to consult regarding potential settlement of claims. On September 20, 2018, the parties held
mediated settlement discussions and arrived at a settlement of claims as outlined below, subject to RTD
Board of Directors approval. If the settlement is not approved, the late November arbitration and pending
discovery remain scheduled.
DISCUSSION
RTD is recommending approval of an agreement which includes total payments of $32.5 million. The
payment schedule is as follows: $15 million within 15 days following Board approval, $8.75 million at

Packet Pg. 83

1.B.8

Substantial Completion, and $8.75 million on September 10, 2019 (current estimate for Final
Completion). In addition, subject to RRP submitting contract-required documentation showing proof of
payment to subcontractors, RTD will not withhold further retention on progress payments and will
release 50% of the current retention amount within 45 days after September 20 (i.e., November 4) with
the balance of retention released as provided by contract.
The settlement agreement further provides that the parties will release all claims and counterclaims in
the arbitration and dismiss the proceedings with prejudice. In addition, RRP agrees to cap any other
reserved claims, including all claims from October 1, 2017 to September 20, 2018 for delay, impact and
costs (excepting only issues and events arising after September 20, 2018) at $8 million. This does not
mean that RRP is guaranteed an additional $8 million; instead, RRP is to provide RTD with backup for
remaining claims, and if not resolved the parties will schedule mediation prior to further dispute
resolution as provided in the contract.
Finally, in an effort to get both sides back to a “clean slate” and promote successful completion of the
project, RRP has committed to cooperate in schedule updates and to provide a schedule with key
milestones in 2019. The settlement agreement expresses the goal for both parties to work together to
mitigate further delays to Final Completion and to strive to achieve revenue service in 2019. RRP and
RTD will work collaboratively to assure, if not improve, the milestone dates. Further schedule workshops
are planned. The settlement agreement also provides that the parties will work together to further
mitigate delays through good faith participation in monthly leadership meetings to begin no later than
October 31, 2018, and a partnering program to be developed by the parties as soon as practicable.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The Recommended Action grants staff authority to draw upon the FasTracks Management Reserve to
fund the settlement. It is anticipated that the first $15 million payment will be taken from the reserve.
Staff is doing a comprehensive analysis of the project funds and the cost to complete the project. Staff
is hopeful that the project will be able to absorb the remaining settlement amounts, but there may be the
need to utilize additional reserves in the future.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Finance Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager and his designees to negotiate and execute all
documents necessary to resolve Regional Rail Partners North Metro Project claims, as outlined in
the settlement memorandum prepared at the conclusion of the parties’ September 20, 2018
mediation; and to authorize use of the FasTracks Management Reserve to fund the first
disbursement of funds in the amount of $15 million.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. This alternative is not recommended because it may
result in substantial legal and operational risks. In particular, the arbitration scheduled for late
November will go forward, but it will resolve only RRP’s claims to October 2017, with RTD
continuing to be at risk for greater claims from October 2017 through the present.

Board Meeting Date: October 16, 2018

Subject:

2018 Budget Transfer for Contracted ServicesAccess-a-Ride

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize a budget transfer from the purchased transportation service line items of the Transdev-OnDemand budget to the service line item of the MV Transportation budget to cover the variation in costs
incurred as a result of the re-assignment of Access-a-Ride service to MV Transportation in 2018. The
total dollar amount of the budget transfer requested is $535,000.
General Manager’s 2018 goals:
 Core Goal #3 Strong Financial Management
 Task Goal #1 Fiscal Sustainability.
BACKGROUND:
RTD currently contracts with four (4) service providers, MV Transportation, Via Mobility Services,
Transdev, and Transdev-On-Demand to provide Access-a-Ride (AaR) paratransit services. Three of the
service providers (MV, Via Mobility Services and Transdev) use RTD-owned vehicles to provide the
service. The fourth provider (Transdev-On-Demand) uses Transdev-owned vehicles (taxi cabs) to provide
AaR service. The current Access-a-Ride contracts were implemented in October of 2017 following the
re-bid of the service in 2016.
DISCUSSION:
At the time the current Access-a-Ride service contracts were implemented, the non-dedicated-vehicle
service provider (Transdev-On-Demand) was scheduled to hire a sufficient number of operators in order
to accommodate 100% of their allotted revenue hours. Due to a variety of reason, including taxi
operators migrating to on-demand services providers such as Uber and Lyft, Transdev-On-Demand has
had a difficult time attracting and retaining enough operators in order to meet their targeted service
delivery for RTD. Despite their aggressive hiring campaigns, they continued to request route closures
due to insufficient personnel. The culmination of hiring challenges forced the Access-a-Ride Call Center
to assign more service to MV Transportation than budgeted. Note: The forces working against the nondedicated vehicle provider have not had a similar impact on our dedicated-vehicle service providers.
The reliance on MV Transportation to absorb the Access-a-Ride service that our non-dedicated vehicle
provider has been unable to deliver, has resulted in an increase in the 2018 costs for MV Transportation
and a decrease in 2018 costs for Transdev-On-Demand. Therefore, it is necessary to transfer budget
funds to ensure that MV Transportation invoices will be paid for service provided through the end of
2018.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
There is no financial impact. There are currently budgeted dollars available in the Transdev-On-Demand
service budget that can be transferred into the MV Transportation service budget.

Packet Pg. 86

1.B.9

ALTERNATIVES:
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize a budget transfer from the purchased transportation service line items of
the Transdev-On-Demand budget to the service line item of the MV Transportation budget to
cover the variation in costs incurred as a result of the re-assignment of Access-a-Ride service
to MV Transportation in 2018. The total dollar amount of the budget transfer requested is
$535,000.
2. Do not approve the budget transfer. This course of action is not recommended as it will require
staff to locate additional sources for budget funding to pay invoices for MV Transportation
service.

of NAFTA, other trade policies, etc.
— Frequent revisions of forecasts to reflect new information

• In March 2018, the BRD switched to the Moody’s Analytics baseline scenario

Access-A-Ride Fare Discussion

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: October 3, 2018
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: October 9, 2018
Discussion

DISCUSSION
In January 2016, there was a fare change including changes to Access-a-Ride fares. The calculation for
the 2016 Access-a-Ride fare was twice the cash fare less double the stored value discount. Twice the
cash fare would have been $5.20 less double the stored value discount ($0.25 x 2 =$0.50). The result
was $4.70 or ($5.20 - $0.50 = $4.70.)
In addition, the Board adopted an additional 10% discount when purchasing an Access-a-Ride 5-Ride
Ticket Book. This would bring the price down to $4.25 for Local and $7.65 for Regional.
For the current fare study, the Pass Program Working Group recommended the elimination of the stored
value discount. Applying the eliminated discount to all the fare structure changes would eliminate the
double stored value discount on the Access-a-Ride. Therefore the original staff recommendation of twice
the cash fare, i.e. $6.00 – Local, $10.50 – Regional, and $21.00 Airport.
Through the public outreach process, we received a large number of comments related to the
affordability of this service. After hearing the public input, staff held a special joint meeting with two
RTD advisory committees, the Access-a-Ride Paratransit Advisory Committee (APAC) and the Advisory
Committee for People with Disabilities (ACPD). At that meeting, we asked for input as to what fare
seemed equitable and reasonable. The representatives of the two committees recommended the
Access-a-Ride fares staff included in the 2019 fare change proposal. Since that time, staff has received
conflicting feedback from individual members of both advisory groups, supporting and opposing the
proposal.

At the Board of Directors meeting on September 18, 2018, the Board adopted the staff proposal, but
asked staff to come back with some options, such as keeping Access-a-Ride fares the same for one
year.
Below is a comparison of three alternatives. (1) Keep the 2018 cash fare rates the same (2) the
Currently Adopted Staff Proposal (3) Applying the existing 2018 methodology (twice the stored value
fare) to the new fare structure.

In addition, if the board elects to keep Access-a-Ride fares the same, the Board must approve a 5-Ride
Ticket Book price. 1) Keep the current price for buying a ticket book which is $4.25 for local and $7.65
for regional, 2) Apply the 2019 adopted ticket book $0.20 discount, which would make the fare $4.50
for Local and $8.30 for Regional, 3) not allow the $0.20 additional discount for purchase of a ticket
book.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
For 2017, the fully allocated cost per boarding for Access-a-Ride $62.92.
The financial impact of
keeping the fares the same: $4.70 – Local, $8.50 – Regional, and $17.50 – Airport, is estimated at
$300,000 for 2019. The additional discount for purchasing a ticket book was not considered in the lost
revenue figure of $300,000.

2019 Requested Budget

CFO/AGM,

GM
Board Meeting Date: October 9, 2018
Information

BACKGROUND
Staff is required to present the 2019 Requested Budget to the Board of Directors in conjunction with
posting it for public inspection. RTD must post its 2019 Requested Budget for public review and
comment by October 15, 2018 in order to meet Colorado legal requirements (CRS 29-1-101). The
preliminary 2019 Requested Budget is included in this document in order to comply with these
requirements. This preliminary Requested Budget is posted to the RTD website and hard copies are
made available in the Board Office for public review.
At this time, Staff is presenting the first draft 2019 Requested Budget. Preliminary 2019 Requested
Budget numbers are subject to further revision and a final budget will be presented in November. The
2019 Recommended Budget will be presented at the November 13th Financial Administration and Audit
Committee meeting with Staff requesting approval to move to the Board of Directors for ratification of
the 2019 Adopted Budget on November 27th.
DISCUSSION
The Board has requested that staff keep it informed on key budget issues that RTD is facing and provide
opportunities for Board members to offer early input during the development of the 2019 annual budget.
Our previous communication included the 2019-2024 Mid-term Financial Plan, which forms the basis for
the 2019 budget, and which is scheduled to be approved by the Board on October 16th.
The budget is driven by the top strategic goals established for the GM by the Board of Directors for
2019, which consist of enhance safety and security, service and human capital balance, fiscal
sustainability, future transportation needs, and asset management/state of good repair.
During development of the 2019-2024 Mid-Term Financial Plan, staff presented a balanced budget to
the Board for 2019. Staff has worked to develop a preliminary proposed budget for the Base System.
Staff also incorporates FasTracks budget numbers for both FasTracks Project and FasTracks Operations.
Both the Base System and FasTracks preliminary budgets make up the 2019 Requested Budget
presented here.
The 2019 Requested Budget is compared to the 2018 Amended Budget below with change from period
to period (in thousands). The summary data is from the attached Exhibit I.

Overview
The 2019 Requested Budget is a first draft budget and includes estimates for sources and uses. The
budget items will continue to be reviewed and the final version incorporating any necessary adjustments
will be the 2019 Recommended Budget scheduled for adoption in November. This Requested Budget
will be updated for items such as fare revenue estimates, sales taxes, grant revenue, and capital
expenditures for both new capital and capital carry forward amounts. Operating expenses will likely be
revised for specific changes.
As stated earlier, staff has developed the 2019 Requested Budget based on guidance from the Mid-Term
Financial Plan. On a combined basis, the 2019 Requested Budget consists of the following:

Packet Pg. 130

1.C.4

(1) Fare revenue:
a. Farebox revenue is forecasted based on the recommended fare change proposal
presented by staff in September 2018 and adopted by the Board. Fare revenue in
2019 is projected to be 11.5% above the 2018 budget per the adopted
recommendation.
b. Farebox revenue for the Base System is forecast to increase to $125.3 million in
2019, an increase of $10.1 million over the 2018 Amended Budget.
For
FasTracks, fare revenue is forecast to increase to $38.3 million, an increase of
$6.7 million over the 2018 budgeted amount. Overall farebox revenue is budgeted
at $163.3 million in 2019, an increase of $16.8 million over the 2018 budget.
c. Per the farebox revenue recommendation, ridership is forecast to show no growth
on the Base System and grow more significantly on FasTracks. Total combined
revenue ridership is projected to grow 4.9% in 2019 over that projected for 2018,
with most of that coming from new ridership on the G Line and SERE. Growth on
existing FasTracks rail lines will continue at a slower rate.
(2) Other operating revenue:
a. This amount includes advertising revenue, joint venture revenue, parking income,
rental income, and miscellaneous operating revenue.
b. Other operating revenue is increased at the CPI over the 2018 Amended Budget
and adjusted for known items. The amount will change if more information
becomes available for the 2019 Recommended Budget. The current run rate for
other operating revenue is generally on track with the 2018 budget.
(3) Sales/use tax:
a. Combined sales/use tax of $668.3 million is budgeted to increase 5.6% over the
2018 projection, per the CU-Leeds School of Business September forecast. The
2019 growth rate is the CU-Leeds Baseline forecast.
b. The 2018 projection shows an increase in sales/use tax of 5.7% over 2017
actuals, also per the CU-Leeds School of Business Baseline forecast.
(4) Grant revenue:
a. Total grant revenue is estimated at $415.3 million (including carryforward grant
funds), an increase of $1.5 million over the 2018 Amended Budget.
b. Operating grant revenue is projected to be $92.4 million on the Base System and
almost $2.0 million for FasTracks. Base System operating grant revenue is
budgeted to decrease $5.3 million from the 2018 Amended Budget due to
fluctuations in funding in fixed guideway, bus facilities funding, CMAQ, CDOT, and
FASTER grant funding for specific programs. FasTracks operating grant revenue is
budgeted to decline $2.9 million from the amended budget due to amounts
reclassified as capital grants.
c. Remaining grant funds consist of capital grant revenue of $320.9 million. Of this
amount, $51.8 million is budgeted in the Base System and $269.1 million is
budgeted in FasTracks. Capital grant revenue is forecast to increase $6.8M for the
Base System and $2.9 million for FasTracks (due to reclassification of operating to
capital) over the current amended budget.

Packet Pg. 131

1.C.4

d. Large grants for the Base System include on-going plus new FTA bus and bus
facilities funding (5339), capital maintenance (5307), fixed guideway (5337), and
state FASTER grants, plus carry-forward of FTA Ladders of Opportunity grant
funding and DRCOG funding for 16th Street Mall reconstruction. The largest grants
for FasTracks will come from final draws on the FFGA for the Eagle project and a
carryforward of Small Starts funding for SERE for FasTracks.
e. As more information becomes available and the capital project carry forward budget
is finalized, capital grant revenue estimates may change accordingly in the
Recommended Budget.
(5) Investment income:
a. Combined investment income of $15.7 million is projected to increase almost $4.0
million over the 2018 Amended Budget due to forecast of higher interest rates on
investable fund balances. Investable fund balances are projected to increase
organically and through contributions.
(6) Other (non-operating) income:
a. Other non-operating income will decline slightly from the 2018 Amended Budget.
b. Recurring non-operating revenue is increased at the CPI but is offset by the Build
America Bonds subsidy which declines as the bonds are paid off (and a portion of
which is currently subject to sequestration).
c. The amount will change if more information becomes available for the 2019
Recommended Budget. The current run rate for other income is generally on track
with the 2018 budget.
(7) Operating expenses:
a. District-wide operating expenses (excluding Mid-Term Financial Plan expense
projects and expense project carryforward) of $699.3 million are budgeted to
decrease $1.1 million from the 2018 Amended Budget. Base System operating
expenses are budgeted to decrease $23.7 million, FasTracks Project expenses are
budgeted to decrease $15.2 million, and FasTracks Operations expenses are
budgeted to increase $37.9 million. Both Base System and FasTracks operating
expenses at this time are target amounts derived from the Mid-Term Financial Plan
but may change in the final 2019 budget as deemed necessary.
b. Mid-Term Financial Plan expense projects are not included in the 2019 Requested
Budget; these projects will be included in the final 2019 budget post-Board
approval of the Mid-Term Financial Plan.
c. The expense projects carry forward (previously approved expense projects) is not
included in the 2019 Requested Budget; this will be identified and included in the
final 2019 budget.
d. FasTracks Capital Programs will account for $13.4 million of the decline in
FasTracks Project expenses due largely to completion of several FasTracks projects
and capitalization of certain costs to the uncompleted corridors.
e. The opening of SERE and start-up/operational costs for North Metro will contribute
to the increase in FasTracks Operations operating expenses. Regarding North
Metro, this Requested Budget includes preliminary amounts submitted by the

Packet Pg. 132

1.C.4

applicable departments; we expect to adjust these numbers in the final budget to
be closer to the Board-approved plan for North Metro.
f. Costs of operating the West Line, R Line, DUS Bus Concourse, Free MetroRide,
BRT, the H-Line extension and SERE are allocated from Base to FasTracks based on
resource drivers on a full-allocation basis, and thus, Base System total expenses are
reduced by the amount of the allocation. A portion of overhead costs is also
allocated for the Commuter Rail Lines. Prior to 2017, the allocation was made on
an incremental basis; in 2017, a change was made to full allocation including
administrative and support costs. The amount of the allocation in 2019 is $42.6
million in YOE (year of expenditure) dollars.
g. FasTracks Operations also includes a $63.8 million estimated service payment to
Denver Transit Operators for Eagle operations and maintenance which began in
2016 and North Metro maintenance to begin in 2019. The latter amount is $6.5
million of the total. The expense is included in the Rail Operations budget.
h. Diesel fuel is budgeted at $2.30/gallon, which is $0.10 higher per gallon than the
budgeted price in 2018, resulting in an incremental higher cost of approximately
$1.0 million over 2018.
i. Gasoline is currently budgeted at an average cost of $2.65/gallon, which is the
same price as in the 2018 budget for no change.
j. All District rent and the $5.0 million contingency fund controlled by the General
Manager are included in non-departmental expenses as well as various customary
miscellaneous expenses.
k. Certain items may materialize after the Mid-Term Financial Plan approval and after
this Requested Budget is presented. These items will be discussed and prioritized
with senior management and it will be determined if funds can be made available to
support these expenditures.
(8) Debt:
a. Budgeted principal payments of $76.8 million on a combined basis are $12.1
million higher than the 2018 Amended Budget due to payment of principal on the
2015A COPs beginning in 2019 and the inclusion of the TABOR principal payment
of $9.4 million in 2019. The TABOR payment is structured to start repaying
principal after the Eagle project is fully in service.
b. Base System principal payments of $62.6 million are $3.6 million higher than the
2018 Amended Budget due to scheduled principal amortization on current debt.
c. FasTracks principal payments of $14.2 million are $8.5 million higher than the
2018 Amended Budget due to scheduled principal amortization on current debt and
the TABOR principal payment noted above.
d. No debt issuance is anticipated for either the Base System or FasTracks in 2019.
Both Base System and FasTracks will draw from previously issued debt to fund
major capital purchases and construction in 2019.
(9) Interest expense:
a. Interest expense is budgeted at $152.1 million (net of capitalized interest), a
decrease of $1.1 million from the 2018 Amended Budget due to the effect of
refundings and scheduled amortization.

Packet Pg. 133

1.C.4

b. Of total interest expense, $19.4 million is budgeted for Base System and $132.8
million (net of capitalized interest) is budgeted on FasTracks. On FasTracks, the
TABOR interest portion is $35.9 million.
c. Capitalized interest is budgeted at $21.4 million, the same amount as in the 2018
Amended Budget. No capitalized interest is budgeted for the Base System, and the
full amount is budgeted for FasTracks solely for the North Metro debt. Capitalized
interest is the interest expense associated with construction projects that is
capitalized as part of the asset value on the balance sheet.
(10) Capital expenditures:
a. Base System new capital expenditures total $50.3 million. This is the amount to be
approved in the Mid-Term Financial Plan for minimum critical projects and is
escalated at the CPI of 2.8%.
b. FasTracks new capital expenditures are estimated at $29.8 million. This is a
preliminary amount subject to change in the Recommended Budget as estimates for
project expenditures in 2019 are reviewed and completed.
c. Capital projects carry forward (previously approved capital projects) is not
estimated at this time but will be included in the Recommended Budget because it
is based on the 9/30/18 close of RTD’s financial statements.
(11) Reserves:
a. The combined TABOR reserve is budgeted at $26.0 million.
b. The FasTracks management reserve is budgeted at $15.9 million at year-end. Set
at $30.0 million in 2016, this reserve is now net of Board-approved transfers to the
SERE and North Metro projects.
c. A $5.0 million contingency reserve is budgeted for the Base System. The purpose
of this reserve is to cover unanticipated needs that may arise through the fiscal
year. The funds will typically be used to fund unbudgeted inflationary increases,
respond to emergencies, new regulations, and to cover cost overruns. The use of
the contingency reserve will be at the General Manager’s discretion. It was
established for the first time in 2018 to minimize excess budgeting for contingency
in individual projects.
(12) Contributed capital:
a. Contributed capital totals $131.2 million for FasTracks, which consists of thirdparty betterments, in-kind, and local match contributions for the Eagle project, R
Line, SERE, and North Metro.
(13) Fund balances:
a. Base System:
i. Increase of $3.0 million to Board-appropriated fund for a total fund balance of
$23.4 million.
ii. No increase to the capital replacement fund for a total fund balance of $0.
iii. Increase of $0.7 million to the unrestricted operating reserve for a total fund
balance of $15.4 million. A larger contribution is not possible at this time in
order to balance the Base System budget.
iv. The unrestricted year-end fund balance is budgeted unchanged at $34.5
million at this time, the same amount estimated in the 2018 Amended Budget.

Packet Pg. 134

1.C.4

The amount for 2019 will be estimated with the 2019 Recommended Budget
once the expense project carry forward is brought into the calculation as well
as any further adjustments to revenue and expenditures.
v. Fund balances are increased in a manner as consistent with Board policy as
possible and the Mid-Term Financial Plan.
b. FasTracks:
i. The total of the same funds for FasTracks is $44.5 million and reflects 3
months of operating expenses for both FasTracks Project/Construction and
FasTracks Operations.
ii. The FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) is budgeted to grow to $84.9
million in 2019 from savings from construction under budget and planned
account growth.
c. District-wide:
i. The total combined fund balances excluding the FISA are projected at this
time to be 16.9% of projected District-wide operating expenses at the end of
2019.
The preliminary 2019 Requested Budget and Fund Balance report which shows the operating and
capital sources and expenditures of the District for Base System and FasTracks is included as Exhibit
I.
