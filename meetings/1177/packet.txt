BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: June 6, 2013

From:

Richard Clarke, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

June 5, 2013

Board Meeting Date: June 11, 2013

Subject:

Easement for Brainard Drive Relocation Project

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager and/or his designee to execute all documents necessary to convey a non-exclusive
drainage easement over 10,881 square feet (0.249 acres), more or less in Section 28, Township 1
South, Range 69 West, City and County of Broomfield, State of Colorado.
BACKGROUND
In 1997, RTD acquired property for future transit facilities in the vicinity of the interchange of US 36 and
96th Street in the city limits of Broomfield. The City of Broomfield held an option on approximately 56
acres of vacant land and lacked sufficient available funding to exercise the option prior to its expiration
in late 1997. RTD desired to secure a portion of the property, at that time below the current market
value and pursuant to an IGA between RTD and the City of Broomfield, RTD exercised the option on the
56 acres. The City of Broomfield had the right to purchase up to 46 acres of the land from RTD at the
original option price prior to the end of 2002. RTD retained 10 acres for future development of a transit
center/park-n-Ride facility. On the property retained by RTD, the Flatiron park-n-Ride was developed.
DISCUSSION
The City and County of Broomfield will acquire a permanent easement from RTD for drainage. The
Colorado Department of Transportation, BNSF and Broomfield desire to relocate the BNSF siding tracks
in Broomfield so that the siding tracks will no longer cross two roadway intersections. In order to do
this, Broomfield must relocate the location where Brainard Drive connects to Midway Boulevard. This is
generally shown on the attached graphic.
The value of the proposed easement has been determined by CDOT and the City and County to be 90%
of the fee value of $2.00 per square foot or $19,586 for the 10,881 square foot easement.
Valuation was based on appraisal work done by Douglas P. Agne, MAI of Pinnacle Evaluation. His
appraisal of adjacent property to the north of the RTD parcel conclude land valuation at $0.55 per
square foot as but also valued the property at $1.33 per square foot if sold for transit oriented
development. The Broomfield City council approved a Purchase and Sale Agreement of the adjacent
north five acres at their April 23, 2013 meeting at $1.00 per square foot.
The grant of this easement will not preclude future development and will in fact enhance future access
to the RTD parcel.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
RTD will receive $19,586 in compensation for the easement.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee
that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager and/or his designee to execute all

documents necessary to convey a non-exclusive drainage easement over 10,881 square feet (0.249
acres), more or less in Section 28, Township 1 South, Range 69 West, City and County of
Broomfield, State of Colorado.
2. Do not authorize the General Manager and/or his designee to execute all documents necessary to
convey a non-exclusive drainage easement over 10,881 square feet (0.249 acres), more or less in
Section 28, Township 1 South, Range 69 West, City and County of Broomfield, State of Colorado.

Factors Affecting Opening Day Light Rail Ridership

• Rule of thumb: minimum time to establish new
travel patterns is at least 6-12 months
• Seasonality
– West Rail Line opened at end of school year
(Auraria and Red Rocks campuses finishing spring
semester)
• High ridership when schools are in session

– Low ridership in “vacation” months such as
summer months and December

• Build out of FasTracks system and increased
transfer/access options
– Denver Union Station land use/TOD
