There were no recommended actions.

#### 1. Parking Activities

Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager of Planning, asked Brian Welch, Senior Manager of Planning Technical Services, and Bill Sirois, Senior Manager of Transit Oriented Development and Planning Coordination, to review the Power Point presentation that was included in the March 8, 2016 Planning and Development Committee Agenda Packet.

Brian Welch pointed out that RTD is one of the largest parking providers in the State of Colorado, with over 50K parking spaces at 100+ locations.  He explained that a technical assessment was underway to provide information the Board needs to understand and consider as it relates to charging for parking.  The goal of the assessment is to answer the following questions:

- What is the relationship between parking charges and ridership?

- How likely are spillover impacts into adjacent residential, commercial, and retail properties?

- How do we address in-and out-of district patrons?

- Would charges be implemented everywhere, or at a subset of park and rides?

- What are hypothetical net revenues based upon alternative pricing structures?

Bill Sirois shared that the parking at Iliff Station is an example of how parking management plans might look in the future.  He introduced Robert Ferrin, City of Aurora Parking Manager, who will be working closely with RTD.  In 2013 the City of Aurora approached RTD about building a parking structure as opposed to the surface lot we had budgeted.  He said RTD agreed to contribute our surface lot funds to a parking structure if Aurora agreed to pay the rest.  Aurora also agreed to take over operation and maintenance of the Park-n-Ride with an annual contribution from RTD.  In return, Aurora is developing a proposal to charge for parking, which will be refined based on Board comments through March and April, with request for Board approval in May.

Bill Sirois expressed another area where parking is being discussed is at the I-25 and Broadway Station.  RTD staff has been involved with the planning efforts of the City of Denver, who is looking to evolve the area with development.  He stated there will be parking impacts, especially as there are parking spaces RTD leases (about 200) that staff anticipates will go away; however, staff feels confident that our partnership with the City of Denver is the best course of action to come up with solutions, as RTD has done in other areas.

Director Folska wondered which company was hired to conduct the technical assessment and how much they were being paid.   Brian Welch said the Prime Contractor was Walker Parking Consultants with CH2M Hill and Fehr & Peers as Sub-Consultants.  The total cost of the assessment is $99,604.

Director Lubow wondered if there was a requirement that some free parking be offered at the Iliff Station.  Bill Sirois said the entire structure could be paid parking as long as it was administered by a third party.

Director Lubow asked how many spaces would be lost at I-25 and Broadway.  Bill Sirois explained the goal is to maintain what we currently control, which is about 1000 spaces; however, he does anticipate there will be periods of time when there are less spaces due to construction impacts.

Director Francone inquired what RTD’s annual contribution would be for the operations and maintenance of the Iliff Station.  Bill Sirois explained RTD agreed to pay Aurora the amount we estimated it would cost to maintain a surface lot in that space.  It would be about $95K initially and escalate over time.

Chait Tobiassen noted that Iliff Statin is in his District.  He shared he has been involved in this project since the beginning.  He stated Aurora has been very proactive in looking at how they can enhance what RTD was planning to provide in terms of parking.  He believes Aurora’s plan has been well thought out with a lot of planning.  Aurora has hired a full-time parking manager and had a great deal of public involvement in this process.  He shared one of the struggles is that not everyone that lives in Aurora is also part of the District so the idea of having one set parking fee makes a lot of sense.  Chair Tobiassen stated this is a new model for RTD and Aurora that may pave the way for how parking looks in the future.  He said he would be supporting the plan and hopes his fellow Directors will as well.

Director Sisk indicated he applauds Aurora’s efforts but he does have several concerns.  He is concerned about RTD’s annual contribution for operation and maintenance.  He finds it difficult to justify RTD making an annual contribution of $95K when there is not surface parking.  It also seems improper to him that RTD is contributing $2.7 million and Aurora is contributing $7.8 million but Aurora is keeping all the parking revenue.  He said in his mind RTD should get a portion of the revenue.  He stated he hopes there are mechanisms for any third party charging for parking to be accountable because our customers will view it as RTD.  He noted in its present state he would vote no on the parking management proposal.

Director Lasater expressed in his opinion, it would be easier to start a new pay-for-parking system with a new parking garage then go back and begin to charge for something that was always free.  He hopes that as parking is being studied we can also look at the benefit of structured versus surface parking.  He noted at the airport there are both kinds of parking but you do not pay the same rate at each lot.

Director Bagley shared that when you look at the Park-n-Ride inventory and analysis, if a Park-n-Ride existing at a location before it was added through construction of a rail corridor the utilization is much higher than for a Park-n-Ride at a brand new location.  He pointed out the Park-n-Ride utilization along the West Line is very low as there were no Park-n-Rides there previously; however, on the Southwest and Southeast, where there were Park-n-Rides before the Light Rail, utilization is very high.  He hopes RTD will embrace something new that relates to parking because he believes a lot of corridors will have problems with parking issues in the future.

Director Bagley asked if his assumption that RTD will own the land and parking garage at Iliff Station is correct.  He wondered if the funds Aurora was contributing came from their general fund.  He also wondered if Aurora was establishing a parking authority.  Bill Sirois explained that RTD would have a long-term lease with Aurora.  RTD would own the ground and Aurora would own the improvement, or parking garage.  Robert Ferrin, City of Aurora, shared that the garage was cash funded through a capital improvement program.  He indicated that currently the parking program would be set up through the general fund which will be turned into an enterprise program as parking management grows.  It would not necessarily be a parking authority but there would be the ability to issue debt as revenues grow.  Director Bagley asked for staff to provide the Board with a written summary of the answers to his questions before the Board Meeting.

Director Lubow shares some of the same concerns as Director Sisk.  She thought Aurora would be paying RTD because it is our land but instead we will be paying them $95K annually.  Aurora will be getting the profits from charging for parking so to her it is a no brainer that either Aurora should be paying us, or at a minimum we should not be paying anything.

Committee Chair James said he is pleased that staff is experimenting with the evolution of parking as a commodity with partners that are cooperative.  He recognizes it is a challenge.  He believes some of the reactions to the I-25 and Broadway plans come from a misunderstanding of what will be happening.  He thinks this will be very interesting to watch evolve and thanked staff for working to educate the Board.

Interim General Manager Genova indicated that staff would provide the Board with the answers to their questions prior to the Board Meeting.

#### 2. Transit Oriented Communities (TOC)

Bill Sirois, Senior Manager of Transit Oriented Development (TOD) and Planning Coordination, reviewed a Power Point presentation with the Board that was included in the March 8, 2016 Planning and Development Committee Agenda Packet.  It included the recommendations from the TOD Assessment along with tier progress as well as updates on the University of Denver Garage, Welton Corridor, Alameda Station, Olde Town and Federal Center projects.  He shared that station area master plans are in development for the following areas:

- Civic Center (RTD)

- Central Corridor – I-25/Broadway (Denver)

- Southwest Corridor – City Center/Oxford (Englewood)

- Southwest Corridor – Mineral/Downtown Littleton (Littleton)

- Southeast Corridor – Colorado/University

- East Corridor – 40th/Colorado (Denver)

Director Anderson commented that at Alameda Station it is important that RTD riders have a way in and out and can easily find parking near our transportation.  She wants to make sure that with any development around our stations we still have room for our riders.

Committee Chair James thinks it is great to see RTD partnering with the community to improve the areas around our transit.
