Access-a-Ride Travel Training Project

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager to enter into a contract with Via Mobility Services for the provision of
Travel Training services. Performance under the contract is for a three (3) year period and the total
contract amount shall not exceed $396,288.00.

BACKGROUND
Several years ago, RTD received an FTA New Freedom grant to, among other things, develop a Travel
Training Program. The program, designed to travel train individuals with disabilities, was to be a catalyst
for motivating individuals to use fixed route services in lieu of ADA paratransit (Access-a-Ride) service.
RTD collaborated with Via Mobility Services (formerly known as Special Transit), an established RTD
paratransit service provider and nationally recognized as a travel training pioneer, to provide travel
training services during an experimental phase in order to assess travel training as a feasible service
offered by the District. It was staff’s intention to work with Via for a short duration in order to build a
program worthy of releasing a Request for Proposals with viable and defined requirements. Having
never provided travel training as a service, staff was initially unable to craft an RFP with sufficient data
allowing companies to intelligently bid on such a proposal.
In April 2010, Via commenced travel training services to a select group of paratransit passengers.
Focusing their attention on individuals with cognitive challenges offered Via a controlled environment in
which they could accurately measure training outcomes. Unfortunately, this group failed to yield a high
number of participants partly due to safety concerns raised by family members. As a result, an
insufficient number of travel training candidates meant staff was unable to gauge whether the program
was a success or failure. Believing in the concept of travel training, Via was asked to continue their
efforts, but this time, using a larger passenger base. Starting in April 2011, Via focused their attention
on any Access-a-Ride eligible passenger and sought the assistance of our eligibility contractor, Easter
Seals of Colorado, to identify travel training candidates during the initial phase of the eligibility
assessment process. The combined efforts of Via and Easter Seals resulted in a more positive return
and Via was able to average 5-8 trainings per month. As a result, staff determined that it would be
appropriate to prepare an official Request for Proposal (RFP) so that established procurement protocols
could be followed and a comprehensive travel training program could be implemented.

DISCUSSION
On February 11, 2013, RTD issued RFP 13-DH-003 for travel training services. Two responses were
received in response to the RFP for travel training services. The Proposers were Via Mobility
Services and Medical Transportation Management (MTM).

Packet Pg. 4

2.12.A

The evaluation team formed to evaluate the RFP responses consisted of Larry Buter, Manager of
Paratransit Services; Carol Coe, Paratransit Services Coordinator; and Carolyn Conover, Sr. Manager
of Contracted Services. The evaluation team reviewed the RFP responses according to the
evaluative criteria as set forth in the RFP for this procurement, which were:
a)
understanding/approach and organization for implementation (35%), b) experience/qualifications and
safety record (35%), and c) price (30%).
The members of the evaluation team individually reviewed the technical proposals submitted by the
two proposers. Each team member evaluated the proposals on how well the proposal met the
evaluative criteria and assigned a score for “Understanding and Approach” and for “Experience and
Qualifications.” The score for the “Price” element of each proposal was calculated by the RTD
procurement staff and was then added to the technical score of each proposal to determine the
overall score or rating of each proposal. The total overall scores resulted in Via Mobility being the
highest rated proposal. It was the consensus of the evaluation team that Via Mobility presented the
best proposal in terms of understanding of the project, proposed management team, proposed
organization/business plan/approach to deliver the requested service, and proposed price.
Overall, both proposals were similar with regard to the understanding of the project and the proposed
operational plan, as detailed in the RFP scope of services. The Via Mobility proposal included a
unique approach for identifying prospective trainees which included placing one of their staff
members at the Access-a-Ride Eligibility Center in order to make contact with and promote travel
training to new paratransit passengers. The evaluation team identified a key weakness of the MTM
proposal was that MTM was not able to identify the local management and training staff that would
be responsible for the day-to-day operations.
Both cost proposals provided a similar hourly training rate; however, the fixed-cost component of the
MTM proposal was over two times higher than the Via Mobility proposal. The total cost for the
three-year contract period proposed by MTM was $589,896.00 compared to $396,288.00 proposed
by Via Mobility. Therefore, it is the recommendation of the evaluation team that RTD award the
travel training contract to Via Mobility Services.

Funds for subsequent years are

ALTERNATIVES
1)
Award the contract to Via Mobility Services, as recommended.
2)
Resolicit the travel training service package. This is not recommended as this would delay the
implementation of this program and have a negative impact on the momentum and positive
results Via was beginning to realize.
3)
Do not award the contract and do not resolicit. This is not recommended as RTD would
forfeit the New Freedom Funds set aside for this project. In addition, RTD would not have a
program in place to provide assistance for Access-a-Ride passengers that want to learn to use
fixed-route service.

US 36 Bus Rapid Transit – Use of Contingency
Funds from Phase I and II Commitments

General

GM
Board Meeting Date: April 11, 2013

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors modify the
formal actions taken on August 23, 2011 and July 24, 2012 concerning RTD funding provided to the
Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) and the Colorado High Performance Toll Enterprise
(HPTE) for Phase I and Phase II of the US 36 Managed Lanes Project. Specifically, it is recommended
that the RTD Board of Directors allow the following actions:



Any RTD funding left over after completion of Phase I may be used for the Phase II project; and
Any RTD funding left over after the completion of both Phase I and Phase II will be used for
acquisition of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) vehicles for the corridor.

BACKGROUND
On August 23, 2011 the RTD Board of Directors authorized funding in the amount of $120 million for
Phase I of CDOT’s Managed Lanes project, which extends from the current High Occupancy Vehicle
lanes ending at approximately US 36 and Pecos to approximately US 36 and Broomfield between
Flatirons and 88th Street in Louisville. On July 24, 2012, the RTD Board of Directors authorized an
additional $15 million for CDOT’s Phase II project, which will extend from 88th Street to Table Mesa.
The Board Report for Phase II funding included the following language, “Should less than $15 million be
required by HPTE to complete the second phase of the project, RTD staff has requested and remains
firm in the conviction that HPTE should reduce RTD’s commitment – prior to that of any of the other
funding partners. In this case, RTD would reprogram any remaining funds into additional BRT
improvements in the corridor.”
DISCUSSION
HPTE and CDOT have advised RTD that the completion of Phase II will require the use of contingency
funds remaining from Phase I, and CDOT and HPTE have requested that RTD authorize the use of
remaining Phase I funds for Phase II. In light of that request and assuming it is authorized by the RTD
Board of Directors, CDOT, RTD and HPTE have developed a proposed framework to allocate any funds
remaining after Phase II is complete. CDOT will use its funds for the I-25 and US 36 Managed Lanes,
which includes capital rehabilitation of I-25 High Occupancy Toll (HOT) lanes structures on the segment
between US 36 and Denver Union Station on which the majority of US 36 BRT services will operate.
The rehabilitation of these structures will be included in the total cost of the US 36 Managed Lanes
Project. The three entities propose that any funds remaining after cost of construction of the entire
Project (Phase I, Phase II, and I-25 HOT lanes structure rehabilitation) will be spent by all parties, for
additional elements to enhance/build out the I-25 and US 36 Managed Lanes and BRT.
CDOT would not use any of its remaining Project funds (other than Bridge Enterprise Funds that are
statutorily restricted) except on projects selected, with RTD concurrence, within the US 36 and I-25
corridors. RTD would use its share of remaining funds solely on BRT vehicle acquisition. DRCOG will be

Packet Pg. 7

2.13.B

asked to commit that any remaining grant funds it has provided to the project remain in the corridor and
be allocated to RTD for BRT vehicle acquisition. HPTE will use all funds (not including shared toll
revenues which may be received by HPTE in the future and which are in any event subject to
expenditure approval by RTD) in the corridor for maintenance and capital reserve or any remaining capital
infrastructure needed for BRT that can be implemented under CDOT/HPTE’s authority.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact resulting from the recommended action, because RTD has already authorized
the full $135 million to CDOT/HPTE for Phase I and Phase II of the US 36 Managed Lanes project.
ALTERNATIVES
1.
Approve the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee
that the RTD Board of Directors modify the formal actions taken on August 23, 2011 and July 24, 2012
concerning RTD funding provided to the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) and the
Colorado High Performance Toll Enterprise (HPTE) for Phase I and Phase II of the US 36 Managed Lanes
Project. Specifically, it is recommended that the RTD Board of Directors allow the following actions:



Any RTD funding left over after completion of Phase I may be used for the Phase II project; and
Any RTD funding left over after the completion of both Phase I and Phase II will be used for
acquisition of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) vehicles for the corridor.

2. Do not approve the modifications to how RTD funding may be applied to the US 36 Managed Lanes
Project. This action is not recommended. The requested use of Phase I remaining funds to complete
Phase II of the US 36 Managed Lanes project, when combined with available grant funds and funds from
other parties, will allow the completion of the managed lanes to Table Mesa, thereby completing the
primary capital improvements required to achieve BRT in the US 36 Corridor.

Donation of Vintage Rolling Stock

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is Recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the
General Manager and/or his designee to donate seven vintage trolleys and buses for restoration purposes to
the Pikes Peak Historical Street Railway Foundation, (dba) Colorado Springs & Interurban Railway.
BACKGROUND
Over the past few decades RTD has taken possession of seven vintage trolleys and buses. RTD has never
restored them or put them in service. They have been moved several times and are currently stored at the
Weston property adjacent to District Shops. With no long-term plan for restoration or use, a constrained
budget, and limited RTD property for storage, the opportunity for disposal was considered in the fall of 2012.
The inventory of vehicles consists of the following: Denver Tramway Streetcars 107 & 329, Denver Tramway
Electric Trolley 519 & 553, British Bristol Double-decker Bus, and two Mack buses numbers 132 and 140. Two
of the vehicles are being stored in a building scheduled to be demolished later this year.
In summer of 2012, RTD received a letter from the Pikes Peak Historical Street Railway Foundation stating
their desire to receive the vehicles, restore them and place them for display. The Pikes Peak Historical Street
Railway Foundation is a non-profit organization that was formed in 1982 and has a primary mission of
restoration and operation of electric trolleys in Colorado Springs and Manitou Springs. Over the years, several
organizations have expressed interest in acquisition of some of the vehicles. All previous offers have not been
pursued due to a lack of funding and resources. This is the first organization that has offered to accept all
vehicles and has adequate funding and resources to do so.
Pursuant to receiving this letter, RTD staff recommended to the Board of Directors that the vehicles be donated
to the Pikes Peak Historical Street Railway Foundation. The Board asked staff to review possible local and
regional opportunities to keep the vehicles in the Denver area, and to gather information on the historical use of
the vehicles. RTD staff developed an advertisement method, described below under Discussion, and compiled
a historical report which is attached.
DISCUSSION
The contracting method for transfer of these vehicles was a Request for Expression of Interest and Information
(REFII). REFII 12 JB-004 was issued on 09/24/12 and copies of the REFII were provided to 18 prospective
vendors in addition to being advertised with the Denver News Agency. The vendor list was:

Advertisement was closed on 10/12/12 with only one proposal received from the Pikes Peak Historical Street
Railway Foundation (dba) Colorado Springs & Interurban Railway.
On 11/01/12 the RTD project team met and discussed the following:
•
•
•
•

Pikes Peak Proposal more than qualifies them for the project of the removal, restoration and transit use
or display of these vintage vehicles.
Pikes Peak is willing to accept all the vehicles listed in the advertisement.
Pikes Peak funding will rely on donations and volunteers for all aspects of the REFII.
Pikes Peak will show credit to RTD by restoring one of the trolleys for display with reference to “RTDTramway”.

The contract for ownership transfer would be zero dollars with removal, restoration, and display of the vehicles
to be the responsibility of the Pikes Peak Historical Street Railway Foundation. The Pikes Peak Historical
Street Railway Foundation is a non-profit organization that was formed in 1982 and has a primary mission of
restoration and operation of electric trolleys in Colorado Springs and Manitou Springs.
DBE INVOLVEMENT
Not applicable for transfer of ownership.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
No impact to RTD’s current or future budgets.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee
the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager and/or his designee to donate seven vintage
trolleys and buses for restoration purposes to the Pikes Peak Historical Street Railway Foundation,
(dba) Colorado Springs & Interurban Railway.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager and/or his designee to
donate seven vintage trolleys and buses for restoration purposes to the Pikes Peak Historical Street
Railway Foundation, (dba) Colorado Springs & Interurban Railway. Instead, continue to store the
vehicles within the Weston property. This alternative is not recommended as RTD has no long-term
plan or budget for restoration or reuse. In addition, the Weston property is being reduced in size to
accommodate new track installation for FasTracks, and a building in which two of the vehicles are
stored needs to be demolished to comply with building codes.

Introduction ............................................................................................................................................................................... 3

2.13.C.a

The Regional Transportation District (RTD) was created in 1969 by the Colorado General Assembly
to provide eight counties in the greater Denver area with bus and light rail transit. The agency’s
history is integrally linked to Denver’s economic and physical development, and its vintage rolling
stock is an iconic representation of that history. Over the past few decades, RTD has acquired seven
vintage trolley cars and buses that are currently stored at the Weston District maintenance and
storage facility. The inventory consists of two Denver Tramway Streetcars (nos. 117 and 329), two
Denver Electric Trolley Buses (nos. 519 and 553), a British Bristol Double‐decker Bus, and two
Mack buses (nos. 132 and 140).
With no long‐term plan for use or restoration of the stored vehicles, a constrained budget, and
limited RTD storage space, the option of disposal became imminent. In view of these
circumstances, the Pikes Peak Historical Street Railway Foundation has initiated interest in
restoring and displaying the vehicles; the RTD Board of Directors is evaluating donating the stock to
the foundation for these purposes. This report serves as documentation of the history of the seven
vintage vehicles remaining in RTD’s inventory.

Documentation and Report Methodology
To understand and convey the significance of the vintage rolling stock, a historic context was
developed within which the RTD and its vintage vehicles could be understood. Historic contexts
provide a framework for identifying and evaluating historic resources through the focused
explanation of important aspects of geography, history, and culture which significantly shape the
development of a community’s or region’s land use patterns and built environment over time.
A literature review was conducted to begin establishing the historic context for the agency and its
vintage vehicles. Information was obtained from the RTD, Denver Tramway Heritage Society, the
Colorado Office of Archeology and Historic Preservation’s (OAHP) Compass database, archives at
History Colorado and the Western Historic and Genealogy Room at the Denver Public Library, and
historic newspaper databases.
After a context was developed, fieldwork was conducted including photographic and written
documentation of RTD’s vintage historic rolling stock resources. Historic photographs, schematics,
newspaper articles, and other relevant documentation were compiled. One major research gap was
identified during the research and documentation process: primary resources were not identified
for the British double‐decker bus. An interview with a former RTD employee lent some insight into
this particular vehicle, as documented below, and secondary resources helped complete the history;
however, further interviews with additional RTD employees/retirees could prove beneficial in
filling in identified gaps.

RTD Vintage Rolling Stock Historic Context
The story of RTD’s vintage rolling stock is the story of transportation in Denver beginning with
cable operation, converting to electricity, and finally transitioning to gasoline power. The entire
Denver streetcar railway system has been determined officially eligible for inclusion in the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP) (site number 5DV.9217 ‐ Denver Street Car/Tramway) under
Criterion A. The Denver streetcar railway system played an extremely important role in the early

Introduction

2.13.C.a

In 1871, the Denver City Railway Company began providing horse‐drawn streetcars for
transportation. Around 1890, after enough tracks had been laid, the company began operating
cable car (also called street car) service. Meanwhile, a competing group called the Denver Tramway
Company (DTC) formed to offer additional animal‐ and cable‐powered cars, and also began
studying electric‐powered transportation. Miles of tracks were laid by both companies during this
time. By 1900, the DTC began converting its cable lines to electric operation using the overhead
trolley system, and in 1901 the Tramway Power facility opened to begin operation. When
electrification was completed, cable cars became surplus. Some were converted for electric
operation and those that were not were burned to salvage metal parts.

Figure 1: Drivers in front of streetcars, circa 1920. Courtesy, History Colorado (Scan #10041590).

In 1893, General Electric introduced a control mechanism for street cars known as the type‐K
controller, which so greatly improved the electric car that most American cities with cable systems
converted to electricity within the first four years of availability. DTC was one of the first firms to
electrify (Hilton 1967, 48). Eventually, the DTC consolidated with its rival companies and formed
the Denver City Tramway Company, which now owned the entire 156 miles of city railway system.
The street cars inherited the cable car’s 3’6” gauge. The South Broadway line was the first
electrified trolley car line to operate in Denver. It continued in operation from December 1889 to
June 1950. In 1909, DTC purchased the Denver and Intermountain Railroad and converted it from
steam to electric power, providing another route to Golden, Colo. (one had already been

transportation history of Denver as it facilitated the development of the urban center and of
suburban neighborhoods by allowing residents an inexpensive way to travel.

2.13.C.a

In 1919 buses slowly began service. Streetcars were replaced with trolley coaches (buses operated
by overhead electric lines) and the cars were in operation by June 1, 1940. Thirty‐six trolley
coaches replaced street cars on four important lines and showed revenue gains of twenty per cent.
More were ordered through 1942
(http://www.trolleybuses.net/den/htm/usa_h_den_misc_ad_ob_trolleycoachesfit_194507_bt.htm).

After WWII, personal automobile sales increased dramatically, and in 1950 streetcar service—both
cable and electric—ended. Tracks were covered under asphalt to convert routes to automobile and
bus traffic use (Jacobs Engineering 2008). In June 1950 the DTC completed the conversion from rail
to rubber‐tire transit with the purchase of approximately 450 trolley coaches, diesel motor coaches
and gasoline buses. The reasons for moving to “rubber transit” were that trolley coaches provided
curbside stops; the system relieved traffic congestion because of the greater maneuverability of the
equipment; and the coaches were quieter in general. These electric buses, which did not require
tracks, operated until 1955, when the DTC announced that diesel buses would replace all electric
coaches (Jones, McKeever, Wagner, and Forrest 1965), reasons for which included lower costs
associated with diesel vehicles, and also the conversion of several major downtown streets to one‐
way.

In 1971 remnants of the DTC were sold to the City of Denver, and in 1974 the Regional
Transportation District (RTD) was created. In 1994 light rail began service. All that remains of the
Denver Tramway rail system is the standard gauge line of the one‐time Denver and Intermountain
Railroad to the Denver Federal Center near Lakewood. This line is currently under construction to
serve as the new light rail West line.

Denver Tramway Streetcars were built in the early twentieth century after the conversion from
cable to electricity and often called “big yellows”. These cars rode on tracks, like railroad and cable
cars, but were operated with electricity via a pole connected to electric overhead lines. Many were
furnished with rattan seating; a copy of As U‐Go, published by the DTC, was slipped into the black
containers of the streetcar interiors, providing transit information. Peak performance for the
electric streetcar was during the period between WWI and the end of WWII. Operation ended June
4, 1950 (Lusky 1968).
While the DTC built some of its streetcars, most were built by the Woeber Carriage Company of
Denver (“Woeber Brothers”) which was founded in Iowa in 1853. In 1867, a Woeber Bros. shop
was opened in Denver on 11th Street. Between 1898 and 1913, Woeber built all of Denver’s
streetcars (http://www.midcontinent.org/rollingstock/builders/woeberbros.htm).
Woeber was responsible for the invention of the unique center‐entrance electric trolley, whereby
two single‐truck bodies were merged on one double‐truck frame. The process involved mounting
the body of a single‐truck closed streetcar on one end of a 39‐foot frame and the body of a single‐
truck open streetcar on the other. A center entrance was constructed between the two. Using
single‐truck cars that were outdated, but not inoperable, solved the problem of financing newer,
larger, and expensive double‐truck cars. These center‐entrance cars rode on a pair of Brill 27‐
General Electric (GE) motor trucks. Some operated as late as 1920
(http://www.midcontinent.org/rollingstock/builders/woeberbros.htm). Later these cars were
fully enclosed (Jones, McKeever, Wagner and Forrest 1965).

Denver Tramway’s Big Yellows

Figure 4: Center entrance on car no. 117.

Two examples of Denver Tramway’s streetcars from the period after the conversion from cable to
electricity are located at an RTD storage facility ‐‐ streetcars No. 117 and 239. Car no. 117 was built
in 1911 by Woeber Bros. (Robertson and Forrest 2010) at West Colorado Ave. and South Bannock
Street (Figures 3 through 6). It was a Denver Tramway City (DTC) car with a 47‐passenger
capacity, weighing 38,300 lbs (Jones, McKeever, Wagner, and Forrest 1965). It is a narrow gauge,
double truck car with four K36G controller–K type engines. These were a direct drum type
controller with the voltage passing directly through copper and brass fingers pressing against a
rotating drum; K‐36 controllers were usually used with Interpole traction motors. The 117 has a
GE 58 motor with 37.5 horsepower, weighing 2,225 lbs and a Brill 27G truck with a 4’ 0” wheel
base. It was a two‐man car, with a motor man up front and a conductor in the middle. The car
could seat 47, but would allow for 90 with standing room. Seats were made of stationary rattan and
oak slat. The roof was a monitor roof, with windows on either side of the roofline. Car windows
featured drop sashes. Other specifics include a total horsepower of 150; a gear ratio of 1:3.94; track
gauge of 3’‐6”; and Type A1 Form 2 Tomlinson couplers (Robertson and Forrest 2010).
The car ran the Englewood route which travelled along South Broadway Avenue (two‐man cars
were limited to Broadway Avenue). It was sold in 1947 to a private owner who used it as a fishing
cabin, and then in 1975 was donated to James E. Kunkle, a former RTD employee and RTD historian.
Kunkle, in turn, donated the car back to RTD, and brought it to the Alameda Division for restoration
for the next two years. Kunkle restored the bus to mint condition, seeking out over one hundred
abandoned trolley cars around Colorado to gather seats and other materials for Car no. 117. It was
pulled for the next five years in downtown parades. According to Kunkle, earlier directors of RTD
promised him they would place the car inside the new RTD Headquarters building at 1600 Blake
Street and then place it in the new Civic Center building at Colfax and Broadway – neither of which
happened. The car is currently in poor condition.

Car #329 was built in 1910, also by Woeber Bros., with a capacity of 47 and weighing 35,350 lbs. It
has two K35B controller engines which operated the same as the K36G above. It has a GE218A
motor with 60 horsepower, weighing 3,000 lbs, and a Brill 27GE1 truck with a 4’ 6” wheelbase. It
was a single‐end, center‐entrance P.A.Y.E. (pay‐as‐you‐enter), Passenger Moter and travelled the
narrow‐gauge city route, which could be different every day. It was sold for scrap between 1949
and 1950 (Robertson and Forrest 2010). The car is in very poor condition.

Electric trolleys (also called “trolley coaches” and “trackless trolleys”) were a hybrid of rubber‐tire
operation and electric overhead operation. In 1930, the number of trolley cars in use in the United
States tripled from 58 to 174 (Brill 2001). Operation began by the DTC on June 1, 1940 when 36
trolley coaches replaced street cars on four important lines and showed revenue gains of 20 per
cent. More were ordered through 1942
(http://www.trolleybuses.net/den/htm/usa_h_den_misc_ad_ob_trolleycoachesfit_194507_bt.htm).
“Rubber transit” provided curbside stops; a system which relieved traffic congestion because of the
greater maneuverability of the equipment; and a quieter system in general. According to Jones,
McKeever, Wagner, and Forrest, the electric trolley coaches were the backbone of the routes after
the streetcars ended service and were busy day and night with standing room only on trips to and
from downtown.
The RDT has two of the rubber‐tire trolley coaches in storage. Trolley coach no. 519 was a Brill‐
Westinghouse (WH), model no. 44SMT (44‐seat capacity) built in 1940. Like streetcar no. 117, this
trolley car was restored by James Kunkle and is the only one left intact from the Denver fleet that
was in service from April 1940‐1955. It was placed on display at the Denver Union Station for
Transportation Week along with the DTC trolley car 117.
Trolley coach nos. 501 to 592 (including 510 and 553) operated out of the Central Division and
were used for the following routes: Route 5 – Berkeley to South Gaylord; Route 11 – E. 11th Ave. to
W. 29th Ave.; Route 13 – E. 13th Ave. to W. 39th Ave.; Route 28 – E. 28th Ave. to W. 44th Ave.; and
Route 40 – Park Hill. The electric buses were put out of circulation by diesel buses in 1950.

Trolley coach no. 553 was a Brill‐GE, model no. 44SMT, built in 1942. J. G. Brill Company was an
American manufacturer of streetcars and buses founded by John George Brill in 1868 as a horse car
manufacturing firm in Philadelphia, Penn. It merged with the American Car and Foundry Company
in 1944 to become ACF‐Brill and ceased production in 1954 (Brill 2001). The company produced
over 45,000 streetcars, motor buses, trolleybuses, and railroad cars.

In forty odd years of DTC bus operation, in excess of 1,000 different buses have been operated.
Mack is an American truck, bus, and trolley bus manufacturing company founded in 1900 in
Macungie, Penn., where all Mack products are made (the company has assembly plants in
Pennsylvania, Maryland, Australia, and Venezuela). Mack was one of the first manufacturers to
mount a cab directly over the engine, which increased driver visibility and maneuverability,
particularly on crowded city streets (“Mack History”). The first Mack bus was built in 1900,
ordered by a sightseeing company. In 1934, production of electric trolley coach buses began,
ending in 1943 with a total of only 290 built, Portland, Oregon being the biggest customer (“Mack
Trucks”).
Mack bus production began in the late 1920s and ended in 1960, producing over 22,000 units
(Eckhart 2000). Buses were typically run until their useful life was complete and then scrapped;
relatively few have been restored or preserved (Eckhart 2000); however, the RTD has two Mack
busses in storage. Mack buses 132 and 140 were C‐47‐DT models built in 1959 (Forrest 1969, 15)
with a seating capacity of 45, a length of 35 feet and a width of 102 inches. According to Kunkle,
Bus 140 served as an information and promotional bus when RTD took over Denver Metro Transit
in 1975. The bus was emptied of its seats and installed with racks for brochures, schedules, and
other RTD information. The driver would take it to park‐n‐ride stations and serve coffee and
doughnuts to customers. Only senior drivers were able to operate this route.

The Bristol Lodekka was a low‐height double‐decker bus built by Bristol Commercial Vehicles of
England. This bus was a revolutionary design because of its low floor. A low chassis design
removed the need for a step up from curb level to the entrance platform. This allowed for an
overall lower height at around 13 ft 6 in compared to a typical height of around 14 ft 6 in for a
conventional highbridge double‐decker. Bristol manufactured over 5,200 Lodekkas between 1949
and 1968. These busses were only available to nationalized bus companies.
The RDT stores a Bristol Lodekka LD (low decker) series with chassis number LD6G 100127, body
serial no. ECW 7067 Series 2, and a Gardner 6LW engine (http://bcv.robsly.com/lodsvocl.html). It
features the traditional rear entrance and half cab
(http://classicbristolbuses.thornet.co.uk/lodekka.htm.) It appears to have been built in 1954 and
was part of the Southern Vectis Omnibus Company fleet which served on the Isle of Wight in
England. In 1976 it was sold or donated to government in Williamsburg, VA, for use in bicentenary
celebrations. Around 1987, the bus was parked at Denver’s 16th Street Shopping Mall and used as
the “Ticket Bus” for theater and transport tickets and as a tourist information bureau. Finally, in
1998, the RTD procured the bus, having been abandoned by its previous owners, and parked it at
the current storage facility (http://bcv.robsly.com/lodsvocl.htm).
No primary or resources were identified for this vehicle, but James Kunkle (2012) confirmed that
the bus was not part of the RTD system and was owned by a private touring company that took
customers around Lamar Square.

The vintage rolling stock described and documented in this report comprises an important piece of
transportation history for the RTD and the city of Denver. It is an iconic representation of Denver’s
economic and physical development over five decades beginning in 1910, when Denver Tramway
Electric Streetcar No. 329 was built, and stretching to 1959, when Mack Buses 132 and 140 were
built. The RTD Board of Directors is currently evaluating options for the preservation and reuse of
the vehicles, including the option of donating them to the Pikes Peak Historical Street Railway
Foundation.
All seven of the vehicles stored at the RTD Weston District maintenance and storage facility have
suffered damage to their interiors and exteriors from weather and years of neglect. The restoration
of the vehicles would impede further deterioration and also allow for potential use in a
museum/educational setting. Regardless of the Board’s decision to move forward with restoration
of the vehicles via the Pikes Peak Foundation or some other entity, the vehicles should be stored
such that they are protected from weather damage and can receive regular maintenance. Further
research should be done on the British Double‐Decker bus which was privately‐owned.

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: April 3, 2013

From:

Terry Howerter, Chief Financial Officer

GM

Date:

April 3, 2013

Board Meeting Date: April 11, 2013

Subject:

Adoption of 2014 Performance Measures

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
adopt the attached 2014 Performance Measures for Goals 1-7. There are 22 performance measures
in total.
POLICY REFERENCE
Fiscal Policy Statements – Budget Policy 10
BACKGROUND
Each year the RTD Board of Directors adopts a vision and mission statement, goals, objectives, and
specific performance measures. These measures provide a framework in which RTD can determine
how well it provides service to its passengers and the citizens of the District. A report detailing yearto-date performance on each of these measures is presented to the Board of Directors following the
end of each quarter.

DISCUSSION
Recommended changes from 2013 to the 2014 adopted goals are listed below:


Goal 2.1 Prompt response to facility complaints
o The goal for average facilities maintenance complaints per month is increased to < 14.0
from < 12.0 per month to reflect full year revenue service on the West Line and actual
experience with West Line maintenance incidents to date. Pre-opening maintenance has
included graffiti and materials theft.



Goal 4.2 Improve level of customer complaints
o The goal for customer complaints per boardings is increased to .0004 from .0003 due
to a static higher level of complaints reached over the last 2-3 years from the
strollers/wheelchairs policy, fare enforcement campaign, TIC availability, the
introduction of SmartCards, and the new West Line which will bring with it additional
complaints.



Goal 6.2 Increase ridership
o This measure will be established by the financial plans inherent in the adoption of the
2014 Annual Budget in November 2013 and is noted as a placeholder until that point.
It is a forecast.



Goal 6.3 Increase in fare revenue, EcoPass revenue, and total operating revenue

Packet Pg. 33

2.13.D

o

Each of these measures will be established by the financial plans inherent in the
adoption of the 2014 Annual Budget in November 2013 and are noted as placeholders
until that point. These are forecasts.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The 2014 Performance Measures will be utilized in the development of the final 2014 Adopted
Budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Adopt the 2014 Goals and Objectives and the accompanying performance measures included
in the 2014 Performance Report.
2. Modify the recommended 2014 Goals and Objectives and the accompanying performance
measures to be included in the 2014 Performance Report and make required adjustments, if
necessary, to the 2014 Requested Budget.
3. Do not adopt the 2014 Goals and Objectives and the accompanying performance measures
included in the 2014 Performance Report.

An accident is considered preventable any time the operator was not driving in full compliance with all applicable laws and
regulations and in such a manner as to avoid involvement despite adverse conditions of road, weather or traffic or the errors
of pedestrians or other drivers.
3
The measure is increased in 2013 due to the addition of the West Line which will add 30% to the overall system and 25
more grade-crossings, coupled with no operating history on the new line.

On-time is arrival at a location no more than 1 minute early and no more than 5 minutes after the scheduled arrival time.

The measure is lowered in 2013 due to system complexity added by the West Line, which will bring with it more single-track
chokepoints on the west end of the line and more crossing points in the CPV. Delays are also coming from signal timing
changes in the downtown district which is affecting performance.

Complaints by type were being monitored by Bus Operations; however, they were unable to gather information from the Trapeze
monitoring system to report on this measure. Reporting began again in 2012 when the issue was resolved.
2
The goal is increased in 2014 to account for static higher level of complaints due to the stroller/wheelchair policy, fare
enforcement campaign, TIC availability, introduction of SmartCards, and the new West Line.
