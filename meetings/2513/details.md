## II. Overview of GM Goal Setting/Performance Evaluation - 40 Minutes

Committee Chair Francone mentioned the committee had received the initial performance appraisal from Dave Genova in the packet and asked GM Genova to speak to the Goals.  He indicated he only made 2 minor changes and will outline those changes as he moves through the goals.

- Core Goal #1 - Successful Delivery of Transit Services: Attain 80% performance measures

GM Genova outlined what adjustments he had made to the goal giving the example of taking Smart Card out as that project was scheduled to complete in 2016.  Director Anderson said this past week the University of Colorado A-Line was problematic and she has a deep concern in managing Denver Transit Partners and wonders if managing DTP should be reflected in this goal.  GM Genova proposed to add a point on managing DTP as he feels it appropriate and thanked Director Anderson for her observation.  Director Bagley asked if this was the appropriate place to put this addition.

Director Bagley asked for an interpretation of the comments in the “exceed expectations” section and asked for clarity of the stated goals.  Committee Chair Francone asked how he would define “outstanding and noteworthy service” and that it should be more clearly defined.  GM Genova gave an example of the 2015 Bronco’s parade which was a record day for ridership.  Director Walker said that example was objective as some constituents were happy and others did not have a good experience.  Director Bagley said when it comes down to the final review GM Genova would outline each of the services and how each goal was reached.  He also made the comment that these goals are agency wide goals under Dave Genova’s leadership and administration.

- Core Goal #2 - Strong & Ethical Leadership Articulates vision, forms cohesive team, regular team-building sessions, builds and maintains effective executive team, and handles conflict

GM Genova has made no changes to this goal from last year and gave examples of speaking engagements and 2 national webinars, internal and external communications that he has been engaged in on an on-going basis in leadership outreach.  Committee Chair Francone also added GM Genova would give additional examples of how he would outline the achievements to the Board and at that point the Board would make a determination based on the criteria stated in the goal.  Director Bagley said he would accept that as a parameter.

Director Menten said the goal also speaks to team building and an in-house employee survey would be a helpful indicator as to how the employees view the leadership.  She stated that when directors engaged in the employee outreach in the GM search process they received valuable insight that might be considered.  She also stated the results of an employee survey should tie into the achieved and exceed in this goal.  GM Genova stated that finding a baseline and what would be an acceptable percentage could be difficult and cautions that employee perception may not be within his control and said this could be addressed in task goal number 2.  Dave Genova spoke to employee appreciation and what activities had recently been proposed and asked if he could bring this back to the committee in the “exceeds expectation” category.  Director Menten would like it addressed in some manner either here or in the task goal and asked about the performance management program.  GM Genova said this would be a continuous improvement for employee evaluation.

Director Anderson thinks getting the temperature in a different way like showing an increase in promotions and is measureable but does not pit the employees against the General Manager.  Chair Tobiassen said there are processes and procedures to determine best practices in the appraisal practices for other executives realizing you would need a baseline.  GM Genova said this could be internal and external and one example would be a 360 review the supervisor utilizes this as an additional tool in the evaluation.  Director Walker said he is afraid we would on only get a snapshot and the idea of a survey and he is not comfortable for the GM to be evaluated through a survey.  It is important to know how the employees feel but not to evaluate against the GM.

GM Genova again said it would be in the “exceeded expectation” category and it is also hard to get full participation.  Committee Chair Francone says she understands the methodology behind the surveys and is not sure if it is appropriate in this instance and there are many different tools that could be utilized.  Director Bagley gave an overview of what GM Genova would bring back to the committee.  Director Anderson mentioned that sometime in 2017 there would be some discussion regarding the CBA and that during those times evaluations of GM would not be appropriate.

- Core Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management Oversees operating and FasTracks budgets, ensures compliance with local, state, and federal reporting, and development of financing plans for future projects.

GM Genova said he has made no changes from last year’s criteria.  Committee Chair Francone had questions about FasTracks and Operations budget and asked if GM Genova would clarity structure and separation of those budgets.  GM outlined that the structure of the budget would stay the same since we still have FasTracks corridors to finish and the capital and operations budgets still require separation.  Committee Chair Francone thanked GM Genova for the clarification.

- Core Goal #4 Ensures Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO)/Affirmative Action (AA)/Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE)/Small Business Enterprise (SBE).

Director Menten asked when the Triennial review was done through FTA.  GM Genova said he did not recall when the last review was completed but stated it was a full review of everything under the FTA umbrella.  He said he would check for the date of the last review and let the committee know.  He also stated the areas of emphasis depend on the FTA issues at the time and that he know the FTA utilizes and outside contract for its audits.  Director Bagley asked if RTD paid for the audit.  GM Genova said he was not sure who pays for the audit and would get back to the committee with that information.

Director Menten would like to see under “exceed expectations” the addition of some language that would reflect structure strongly encouraging graduation from the SBE/DBE program.  GM Genova said he has some thoughts surrounding an incentive program or awards ceremony in recognition of those companies that have utilized the program as it was intended in reaching graduation and would encourage graduation to all participants.  In speaking to some of the teams some are interested in graduating and other want to stay in the program for continued work.  GM Genova said he would make the requested changes for committee review.  Director Bagley requested GM Genova to use a redline format for the changes.

- Goal #5 – Effective Communications & Community Outreach: Keeps Board informed, periodically meets with Board members, delivers presentations in local and national venues, and continues Public Information/Public Relations planning and implementation.

GM Genova outlined the changes he made from last year’s goal from develop the 2016 FasTracks and Public Information plans to continuing and implementing on a greater scale including FasTracks and Operations district wide.  Director Anderson added this fits into the goals outlined in the March advance. Director Bagley commented that the “exceeds expectation” category would need to include some examples.  Director Walker confirmed that relevant articles and national recognition would be valuable as elements of this goal.

- Task Goal # 1 Fiscal Sustainability.

GM Genova said he has defined the goal to outline the specific bullet points listed in the advance.  Director Bagley confirmed the bullet points were generally defined correctly.  Committee Chair Francone asked for GM Genova to explain in the “exceed expectations” category what he meant by “advance mobility option” and what that might look like.  GM Genova outlined what his idea thought were for the last mile as in working with Lyft and Uber to offer another service that did not have a financial impact.  He expanded on the fact that it is important that we are inclusive to everyone in our mobility efforts and the Uber’s and Lyft’s of the world are not currently accessible.

Director Bagley mentioned that just because a large percent of our constituents did not have credit cards that we should not pursue all payment options available.  GM Genova said once we start mobile ticketing next year all options for payment will be available.

Director Bagley asked if in the “exceeds expectation” bullet point 2 under revenue, he feels that 5% is a large number and is not sure it is a goal can be met.  Director Anderson said if you take out all other defined criteria 5% is not a large number.  GM Genova commented station naming, driving up ridership and third party parking would all contribute to this goal.  Director Bagley asked if there have been discussions to determine our financial condition.  GM Genova said they have had these conversations and currently in terms of capacity we do not have much to work with.

- Task Goal # 2 – Workforce/Human Capital.

GM Genova said this was a goal he had to start from scratch.  He spoke to the “achieved goal” as outlined and GM Genova explained the different types of the training offered to employees and a mandatory training path within a particular time frame for all salaried employees.  He went on to outline what is done for employee recognition and the Employee Recognition Event and defined some of the continuous improvement model to encourage decision making and ownership for agency processes.  Peak Green Belt pilot is being offered agency wide.  GM Genova spoke to employee recognition and cited a few examples of what they are thinking and the challenges in planning an agency wide event.  The estimated budget could be as high as $250 thousand dollars.

Director Walker asked about sponsorships.  GM Genova said we do utilize our vendors but was not sure if that would be the best way to move forward.  Director Bagley asked what the Bus and Rail rodeo events cost.  GM Genova said he would get those figures for Director Bagley as he did not have them at his fingertips.  GM Genova said the plan is to recognize the employees in early 2017 for all the work done for the openings in 2016 and that they do have some small recognitions planned at all the divisions over the summer such as Ice cream socials and barbeques which can be executed at a small cost and high impact.  GM Genova spoke to the continuous improvement process working group that he implemented for the recruitment, hiring and retention process that is currently in motion.

GM Genova said in the “exceeds expectations”  he has added “meets bus driver headcount”  and that this would be a stretch target as he does not think we have ever been at headcount since he has been here.  Director Bagley asked if this included the outside contractors as well.  GM Genova said that vendor staffing is not within our control therefore not appropriate to include this in our goal.

- Task Goal # 3 State of Good Repair – Operations and Maintenance

This was another goal that was completely new.  GM Genova reviewed the elements of the “achieved goals” to be in full compliance to the RTA safety and asset management rulemakings.  Create and measure through reliability reporting and have a completed State of Good Repair evaluation.  GM Genova explained the “exceeds expectations” and the concept of backlog.  Director Anderson asked where and how can we be sure DTP and DTO are complying with the goal regarding state of good repair.  Dave Genova said we are the owner of the assets for DTP and they are defined the same way we are and will be tracked and reported on in our reporting structure.
