#### 1. Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) Update

Committee Chair Lubow indicated that there was a change in the Agenda and the Citizens Advisory Committee would not be providing the Board with an update this evening.  They will present at the next FasTracks Monitoring Committee Meeting in January, 2014.

#### 1. Renaming of I-225 Rail Line City Center Station

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors adopt the Aurora Metro Center Station name for the station on the I-225 Rail Line currently referred to as the Aurora City Center Station in the Environmental Evaluation document. This recommendation is consistent with the current Board policy on station naming. It is also recommended that the existing Centrepoint/Sable bus transfer facility located at the station area also be renamed to be consistent with the light rail station.

Motion:              Director Tobiassen made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the December 17, 2013 Board meeting.

Director Folska seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Tina Jaquez, Public Information Manager for I-225, stated that staff has collaborated extensively with the stakeholder, the City of Aurora, to understand the reasoning behind this change.  She said based on this collaboration, staff recommends moving forward.

Committee Chair Lubow declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

#### 2. Station Names for Eagle P3 Project

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors approve the following station name changes for the Eagle P3 Project. For comparison, the current station names in use are shown in parentheses.

Gold Line:

Pecos Junction (change from Pecos)

Wheat Ridge • Ward (change from Ward Road)

East Corridor:

Motion:              Chair Anderson made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the December 17, 2013 Board meeting.

Director Bagley seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Kevin Flynn, Public Information Manager for Eagle P3, explained that RTD has a deadline from Denver Transit Partners to confirm station names by the end of the year so DTP may begin systems work.  The Eagle Project staff has met with Marketing to determine recommended station names.  He said that his team also solicited input from the six local governments involved.  He stated that based on this input staff was coming forward with a recommendation for the six station name changes.

Committee Chair Lubow declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

#### 3. FasTracks Citizens Advisory Committee Appointments

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors appoint three (3) new members and reappoint two (2) members to the FasTracks Citizens Advisory Committee of the Regional Transportation District (RTD) for three-year terms.

Motion:              Director Sisk made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the December 17, 2013 Board meeting.

Director Solano seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager of Planning, shared that the nominating committee received and reviewed 40 applications.  He said staff did extensive outreach to solicit candidates and applications.  Bill Van Meter stated that the nominating committee unanimously recommends the slate presented to the Board.  He noted there are two members who would be serving their second term and three new members to fill the seats of the terms limited CAC members.

Director Folska asked if the candidates were present.  Bill Van Meter said that due to the anticipation of the long evening staff did not formally invite them.  Director Folska suggested making arrangements in the future so that they may address the Board.

Director Folska thanked the CAC members, Roger Sherman and RTD staff for listening to the Board’s request to see new people and broaden the diversity of the CAC.  She thinks the nominating committee did a great job.

Director Sisk seconded Director Folska’s comments about listening to the Board.  He shared that he has known Mayor Stuart for many years and thinks it is great to have her on the committee.

Chair Anderson thanked the two Board members, Directors Hoy and Rivera-Malpiede, who sat on the nominating committee.  She thinks they did a great job in reappointing the two previous members and likes the diversity of the three new members.

Director Bagley commented that the first listed new appointee, Tyler Kealy, previously worked in an intern position at RTD.  He said that in the previous year he was the second runner up but was an outstanding young fellow.  Director Bagley said he is excited he reapplied and is now a part of the CAC.

Committee Chair Lubow declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

### D. Other Matters

Rick Clarke said there was a pending organizational change that he wanted to discuss with the Board.  Jim Starling, Project Manager for the West Line and now on North Metro, will be leaving RTD for a job in the private sector.  Rick Clarke stated that this will be a loss to RTD.  He noted that Jim has come up through the ranks, starting as a Construction Inspector, moving to Head of Engineering on T-Rex, and then becoming Project Manager on the West and North Metro Lines.  Rick Clarke stated that this will be a loss to the organization but changes like this are not uncommon.  He said that Jim Starling will be with RTD until January and staff has already begun the recruitment process.

General Manager Washington provided the Board with a fact sheet on the DesignLine issue.  He noted that staff has discussed DesignLine with the Board several times.  General Manager Washington informed the Board that there was a recent newspaper article stating that DesignLine owes RTD about $31K and made it sound like we gave them $21 million; however, he stated that this is completely untrue and inaccurate.  RTD purchased two 16th Street Mall buses with a five year option to purchase an additional 57 buses.  He shared that RTD began testing the buses in 2012.  Staff came to the Board for approval of the purchase of 34 additional buses at a not to exceed cost of $24.1 million but RTD did not pay DesignLine.  General Manager Washington stated that our agreement with DesignLine was to only pay them when RTD received the buses.  He noted that in August Deisgnline filed for bankruptcy and RTD is still negotiating with the bankruptcy court.

Director Tobiassen asked when we might get released from our agreement with DesignLine so we can issue a new RFP.  Marla Lien shared that when staff met with the new owners they did not indicate they would voluntarily release us.  She informed the Board that RTD retained a bankruptcy attorney on the East Coast who will petition the bankruptcy court that the contract be released.  She said that staff expects that to be granted but we cannot safely go out with an RFP until that happens.

### F. Adjourn

Committee Chair Lubow adjourned the meeting at 7:35 p.m.
