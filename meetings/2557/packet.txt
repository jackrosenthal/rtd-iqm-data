Board Meeting Date: December 20, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Resolution”), authorizing the issuance of sales tax
revenue bonds (FasTracks Project) of the Regional Transportation District (Colorado) to retire certain
outstanding obligations; providing for other matters related to such bonds and the security therefor; and
approving the execution and delivery of certain documents in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby.
BACKGROUND:
The Denver Union Station Project Authority (DUSPA) was established in 2008 to implement and
direct construction and improvements for the Denver Union Station Project. DUSPA is governed by a
Board of Directors comprised of appointed members from the Regional Transportation District, the
City of Denver, DRCOG, and CDOT.
In 2010, RTD entered a funding agreement with DUSPA as part of the plan of finance related to the
design, construction and renovation of the Denver Union Station project area. The funding
agreement was in the form of a bond payment from RTD to DUSPA in the amount of approximately
$12 million per year at an interest rate of 5.85% (RTD/DUSPA Bond). As a result, DUSPA was able
to use the RTD revenue along with other available revenue sources to obtain a Railroad Rehabilitation
& Improvement Financing (RRIF) loan and Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act
(TIFIA) loan from the US Department of Transportation.
In October 2016, the DUSPA Board issued a Request for Proposals for refinancing the outstanding
DUSPA loans. DUSPA received seven responses which were reviewed by the DUSPA Board, its
financial advisor, PFM and staff from RTD and the City and County of Denver. The best proposal
was deemed to have come from a collaboration between Piper Jaffray and BBVA Compass Bank.
The proposal offers financial benefit to RTD, the City and County of Denver as well as DUSPA.
This action item discusses the refinancing of the RTD/DUSPA bond to achieve a reduction in interest
payments for RTD.
DISSCUSSION:
With the current low interest rate environment the opportunity to refinance for interest savings is
available in relation to the RTD/DUSPA bond. RTD has the opportunity to refinance the 2010
RTD/DUSPA bond with RTD FasTracks bonds and realize a substantial savings in interest payments.

Packet Pg. 6

2.11.A

The Bond Resolution requires a minimum of 3% savings which allows some flexibility in regards to
changes in interest rates between now and the date the bonds are sold. The potential savings from
a refunding of the RTD/DUSPA Bond exceeds the typical threshold for a refunding by RTD.
Consequently, staff has assembled a financing team and prepared documentation to be in a position
to take advantage of the opportunity for RTD to reduce its interest expense.
Due to the unique nature of the RTD/DUSPA Bond and the fact that there are multiple stakeholders
including DUSPA and the City and County of Denver, the exact timing of this transaction will be
dependent on the ability of all involved parties to coordinate a simultaneous closing, as required by
the RRIF and TIFIA loans. It is expected that this will be achievable during the first half of 2017.
The Chief Financial Officer has taken preliminary actions to arrange for the issuance and sale of the
bonds, including assembling financial information related to the District and drafting a preliminary
official statement, bond indenture, continuing disclosure agreement, bond purchase agreement and
the Resolution for issuance of the Bonds. The Board is being requested, through the Resolution to
authorize the issuance, to establish the terms and to approve agreements required in connection with
the issuance of the Bonds.
Drafts of documents referenced in the Bond Resolution including the Bond Indenture, the Continuing
Disclosure Agreement, the Preliminary Official Statement and the Bond Purchase Agreement are
available for review in the Board Office.
RTD is receiving the advice of First Southwest Company, as independent financial advisors and
Butler Snow LLP as Bond Counsel in regard to the Bonds. The Bonds will be underwritten by a team
including Piper Jaffray, Stifel Nicholaus, Harvestons Securities and DA Davidson.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Costs associated with the refunding bonds are considered “costs of issuance” and will be funded out
of Bond proceeds. These costs include underwriter, rating agency, financial advisory, attorney and
printing fees.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the execution of documents, including the attached Resolution No.__, Series of
2017, authorizing the issuance of sales tax revenue bonds (FasTracks Project) of the Regional
Transportation District (Colorado) to retire certain outstanding obligations; providing for other
matters related to such bonds and the security therefor; and approving the execution and
delivery of certain documents in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.
2. Do not authorize the execution of documents, including the attached Resolution No.__, Series
of 2017, authorizing the issuance of sales tax revenue bonds (FasTracks Project) of the
Regional Transportation District (Colorado) to retire certain outstanding obligations; providing
for other matters related to such bonds and the security therefor; and approving the execution
and delivery of certain documents in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

Subject:

Refunding 2007A FT Bonds

CFO/AGM,

Date: December 8, 2016

GM
Board Meeting Date: December 20, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Resolution”), authorizing the issuance of sales tax
revenue bonds (FasTracks Project) of the Regional Transportation District (Colorado) to refund certain
outstanding FasTrack Bonds; providing for other matters related to such Bonds and the security
therefor; and approving the execution and delivery of certain documents in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby.
BACKGROUND:
In 2007, RTD issued its Series 2007A FasTracks bonds to refinance a portion of the Series 2006A
FasTracks bonds. The original proceeds from this financing were used to partially fund construction
of various FasTracks projects including, US36, West Line and EAGLE.
This action item discusses the refinancing of a portion of the currently outstanding Series 2007A
FasTracks bonds to achieve a reduction in interest payments.
DISSCUSSION:
RTD issued its $363.725 million Sales Tax Revenue Bonds (FasTracks Project) Series 2007A (the
“2007 Bonds”) in 2007 for the purpose of refinancing a portion of the Series 2006A FasTracks
bonds for interest savings. In 2007, interest rates were such that the District refunded $363.725
million of the $600 million 2006A Bonds to capture $11.373 million in present value savings
(3.122% of principal of refunded bonds).
With the current low interest rate environment and the approaching November 1, 2017 call date on
the series 2007A bonds, the opportunity to refinance for interest savings is available. RTD has the
opportunity to advance refund a portion of the outstanding 2007A Bonds to realize, subject to
market movement, a savings of approximately $5.8 million (4.2% of principal of refunded bonds) on
a tax-exempt basis. The Bond Resolution requires a minimum of 3% savings which allows some
flexibility in regards to changes in interest rates between now and the date the bonds are sold. The
2007A Bonds are callable November 1, 2017 at par.
While the potential refunding savings are significant, it is important to note that, such savings are net
of a cost resulting from (a) the inability to invest proceeds of the refunding bonds at a return equal to
the interest rate on the new bonds, and (b) the length of time between the sale of the refunding
bonds and optional redemption date of the 2007 Bonds (“Negative Arbitrage”). Absent a change in
interest rates, the savings to RTD improves with the passage of time, due to a reduction in time

Packet Pg. 22

2.11.B

proceeds of the refunding bonds must be invested prior to redeeming the 2007 Bonds. Despite the
cost associated with the Negative Arbitrage, the potential savings from a refunding of the 2007
Bonds exceeds the typical threshold for a refunding by RTD. Consequently, staff has assembled a
financing team and commenced documentation to be in a position to take advantage of the
opportunity for RTD to reduce its interest expense.
The Chief Financial Officer has taken preliminary actions to arrange for the issuance and sale of the
bonds, including assembling financial information related to the District and drafting a preliminary
official statement, bond indenture, continuing disclosure agreement, bond purchase agreement and
the Resolution for issuance of the Bonds. The Board is being requested, through the Resolution to
authorize the issuance, to establish the terms and to approve agreements required in connection with
the issuance of the Bonds.
Drafts of documents referenced in the Bond Resolution including the Bond Indenture, the Continuing
Disclosure Agreement, the Preliminary Official Statement and the Bond Purchase Agreement are
available for review in the Board Office.
RTD is receiving the advice of First Southwest Company, as independent financial advisors and
Butler Snow LLP as Bond Counsel in regard to the Bonds. The Bonds will be underwritten by a team
including Morgan Stanley, US Bancorp, Loop Capital, Harvestons Securities and George K Baum.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Costs associated with the refunding bonds are considered “costs of issuance” and will be funded out
of Bond proceeds. These costs include underwriter, rating agency, financial advisory, attorney and
printing fees.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the execution of documents, including the attached Resolution No.__, Series of
2017, authorizing the issuance of sales tax revenue bonds (FasTracks Project) of the Regional
Transportation District (Colorado) to refund certain outstanding FasTrack Bonds; providing for
other matters related to such Bonds and the security therefor; and approving the execution
and delivery of certain documents in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.
This is the recommended action.
2. Do not authorize the execution of documents, including the attached Resolution No.__, Series of
2017, authorizing the issuance of sales tax revenue bonds (FasTracks Project) of the Regional
Transportation District (Colorado) to refund certain outstanding FasTrack Bonds; providing for
other matters related to such Bonds and the security therefor; and approving the execution and
delivery of certain documents in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. This is
not the recommended action as it would not take advantage of the interest expense savings
currently available to the District.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Resolution”), authorizing the execution and delivery
by the RTD of a lease purchase agreement and related documents in connection with the refinancing
of the 2002A transit vehicle project.
BACKGROUND:
In 2002, RTD issued its Series 2002A certificates of participation (COPs) to finance 34 new Siemens
light rail vehicles and partially fund the Elati light rail maintenance facility. The amount financed in
2002 was $132,000,000. The COPs are callable at par on November 1, 2017 and final payment is
scheduled to occur in 2022.
The remaining outstanding balance of the COPs is currently $71,400,000 and the interest rate being
paid ranges from 4.5%-5.0%.
The approaching call date and current low interest rate environment have created an opportunity to
refinance the 2002A COPs to realize a reduction in interest payments.
DISSCUSSION:
RTD has the potential to advance-refund a portion of the remaining outstanding Series 2002A COPs
to realize, subject to market movement, a savings of approximately $4.86 million (6.81% of principal
of refunded COPs). RTD Board Policy and the Resolution require a minimum of 3% savings which
allows some flexibility in regards to changes in interest rates between now and the date the new
interest rate is locked.
While the potential refunding savings are significant, it is important to note that such savings are net
of a cost resulting from (a) the inability to invest proceeds of the new financing at a return equal to
the interest expense of the new financing, and (b) the length of time between the execution of the
new financing and the November 1, 2017 call date of the 2002A COPs (negative arbitrage). Absent
a change in interest rates, the savings to RTD improves with the passage of time, due to a reduction
in time proceeds of the new financing must be invested prior to redeeming the 2002A COPs.
Despite the cost associated with the negative arbitrage, the potential savings from a refunding of the
2002A COPs exceeds the typical threshold for a refunding by RTD. Consequently, staff has
assembled a financing team and commenced documentation to be in a position to take advantage of
the opportunity for RTD to reduce its interest expense.

2.11.C

RTD typically uses COPs to finance vehicles when the budget cannot accommodate the use of cash
to acquire the necessary vehicles, as was the case in 2002. In this case, staff received an attractive
proposal from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. for the use of lease financing to refinance the Series
2002A Certificates of Participation. As a response to this proposal, staff solicited similar proposals
from the banks in RTD’s underwriter pool. Five responses were received and reviewed by staff and
RTD’s financial advisor. It was determined that the JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. proposal offered the
most value to RTD.
Benefits of the JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. proposal include interest rates competitive with a
refinancing of the 2002A COPs with new COPs, a call option for RTD after just 12 months and the
ability to avoid the cost of obtaining credit ratings.
The Board is being requested through the Resolution to authorize the refinancing of the Series 2002A
COPs through an annually appropriated capital lease through JP Morgan Chase Bank N.A.
Drafts of documents including the Lease Purchase Agreement, Escrow Agreement, Purchase and
Assignment Agreement are available for review in the Board Office.
RTD is receiving the advice of First Southwest Company as independent financial advisors and Butler
Snow LLP as Bond Counsel, in regard to the transaction. The lender in this transaction will be
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Costs associated with the refunding are considered “costs of issuance” and will be funded out of
proceeds. These costs include financial advisory, attorney and miscellaneous costs. The final
payment year of the new financing will not exceed the final payment year of the existing Series
2002A COPs.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the execution of documents, including the attached Resolution No.__, Series of
2016, authorizing the execution and delivery by the RTD of a lease purchase agreement and
related documents in connection with the refinancing of the 2002A transit vehicle project.
This is the recommended action.
2. Do not authorize the execution of documents; including the attached Resolution No.__, Series of
2016 authorizing the execution and delivery by the RTD of a lease purchase agreement and
related documents in connection with the refinancing of the 2002A transit vehicle project. This
is not the recommended action as it would not take advantage of the interest expense savings
currently available to the District.

Section 7.
No General Obligation Debt. No provision of this Resolution, the
Lease or the Assignment Agreement shall be construed as creating or constituting a general
obligation or other indebtedness or multiple fiscal year financial obligation of the District within
the meaning of any constitutional or statutory provision, nor a mandatory charge or requirement
against the District in any ensuing fiscal year beyond the then current fiscal year. The District
shall have no obligation to make any payment with respect to the Assignment Agreement except

renew the Lease or to exercise its option to purchase the 2016A Leased Property pursuant to the
Lease. The Board hereby determines and declares that the period during which the District has
an option to purchase the 2016A Leased Property (i.e., the entire maximum term of the Lease)

the District its option to purchase all of the 2002A Leased Property in accordance with the terms
and provisions of the 2002A Master Lease and to redeem all of the 2002A Certificates (the
“Refunded Certificates”), on December 1, 2017 at a redemption price equal to the principal
amount thereof plus accrued interest thereon to the redemption date or maturity date, without
premium, or as otherwise set forth in the Sale Certificate related to the Refunding Project. Upon
the execution of the Sale Certificate related to the Refunding Project, the District hereby

Section 10.

acts in good faith, no civil recourse shall be available against such member, officer, or agent for
payment of any amounts due under the Lease or the Assignment Agreement. Such recourse shall
not be available either directly or indirectly through the Board or the District, or otherwise,
whether by virtue of any constitution, statute, rule of law, enforcement of penalty, or otherwise.
By the acceptance of the Assignment Agreement and as a part of the consideration of its sale or
purchase, any person purchasing or selling the Assignment Agreement specifically waives any
such recourse.

for the quiet enjoyment of the 2016A Leased Property by the District during the Lease Term and

or unenforceability of such section, subsection, paragraph, clause or provision shall not affect
any of the remaining provisions of this Resolution or such documents, the intent being that the
same are severable.

From:

Subject:

Update to the 2017 Quarterly Performance
Report

CFO/AGM,

Date: December 8, 2016
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: December 20, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors adopt updated 2017 Quarterly Performance Measures to include measures for ridership,
fare revenue, total operating revenue, and commuter rail.
POLICY REFERENCE
Fiscal Policy Statements – Budget Policy 10
DISCUSSION
The year-to-date performance measures provide a framework in which RTD determines how well it
provides service to its passengers and the citizens of the District within its mission statement
objectives. In 2017, 41 performance measures will be tracked for the GM.
When the 2017 performance measures were adopted by the Board in April 2016, it was stated
the following measures would be established by the financial plans inherent in the 2017 Adopted
Budget. These measures are as follows:
Goal 6.2 – Increase Ridership
It is recommended that the overall ridership increase for 2017 be established at 6.8%. This
assumes all ridership growth will come from FasTracks as the Base System ridership estimate for
2017 is flat over 2016. This is an annual measure.
Goal 6.3 – Increase in Fare Revenue and Total Operating Revenue
It is recommended that the fare revenue increase for 2017 be established at 15.5%. This is the
percentage increase in total fare revenue in the 2017 Adopted Budget over the 2016 projection.
The increase is driven by increased ridership in FasTracks as Base System ridership and fare
revenue are kept flat in 2017. This is an annual measure.
It is recommended that the total operating revenue increase for 2017 be established at 15.9%.
This is the percentage increase in total operating revenue in the 2017 Adopted Budget over the
2016 projection, which takes into account minor items of operating revenue such as advertising,
joint venture, parking, and other miscellaneous revenue. This is an annual measure.
Goal 6.4 – Monitor Selected Internal Functions for Efficiency
The goal for annual audits is changed for 2017 from the number of audits to the percentage
completion of the Annual Audit Plan per Board approval on 11/29/16. The goal for percentage
completion is 100%.
Commuter Rail
It was noted when the 2017 Performance Measures were adopted by the Board in April 2016 that
a performance protocol was being developed for commuter rail linked to the concessionaire
agreement with DTP and that measures to be tracked in 2017 would be brought to the Board at a
later date for review. The following measurement criteria have been developed:

Packet Pg. 50

2.11.D

Goal 1.5 – Reduce the Number of Commuter Rail Accidents
It is recommended that a new goal be added to measure the number of reportable preventable
commuter rail accidents per 100,000 train miles. The measure is the same as for light rail in
preceding Goal 1.4.
Goal 3.1 – Maintain System-Wide On Time Performance
It is recommended that a goal for commuter rail be added of 90.0% which is the same as light rail
on-time service. The on-time definition for commuter rail is departure from a location no more
than 0 minutes early or 5 minutes after the scheduled departure time.
Goal 3.2 – Maintain System-Wide Service Availability
It is recommended that a goal for commuter rail be added of 97.0% which is lower than light rail
service available because of additional FRA requirements that must be followed to bring commuter rail
cars into service. The measure is calculated as actual car miles operated divided by total scheduled
car miles.

Board Meeting Date: December 20, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager to execute all documents necessary to award a contract to First
Southwest, a division of Hill Top Securities to act as financial advisor (and Municipal Advisor as
defined by the Securities Exchange Commission) not to exceed $600,000 over a maximum of 5
years.
BACKGROUND:
Financial advisor services are necessary to complete the issuance and refinancing of bonds and
certificates of participation. Their services help RTD achieve the lowest cost of capital available in
the market by providing guidance on appropriate pricing of bonds and certificates of participation and
assisting in the management of credit rating agency relations. Additionally, investment banks are no
longer allowed to discuss financing or refinancing ideas with local governments unless the local
government has retained a Municipal Advisor as defined by the Securities Exchange Commission.
DISSCUSSION:
In October 2016, RTD issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) for financial advisory services. Proposals
were received from three firms and the proposals were reviewed by a review committee of 5 RTD
employees. The three firms that responded to RTD’s RFP included First Southwest, PFM and George
K. Baum.
Proposals were reviewed by the review committee and judged based on a best value to RTD basis.
It was determined that the First Southwest proposal offered the most value to RTD.
Benefits of the First Southwest proposal include an in depth understanding the existing RTD capital
structure, existing RTD debt and other financial obligations, constraints and priorities of RTD. The
Fees of all three proposals were judged to be competitive with each other.
The Board is being requested through the Resolution to authorize the General Manager to execute all
documents necessary to award a contract to First Southwest, a division of Hill Top Securities to act
as financial advisor (and Municipal Advisor as defined by the Securities Exchange Commission) to
RTD.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Costs associated with the contract will be paid for with local funds. The contract will be for three
years with two optional one-year extensions. The cost of the contract for a full five years would be

Packet Pg. 62

2.11.E

$600,000 ($120,000 per year). The funding for the contract was included in the 2017 adopted
budget, SBP and APE.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the General Manager to execute all documents necessary to award a contract to
First Southwest, a division of Hill Top Securities to act as financial advisor (and Municipal
Advisor as defined by the Securities Exchange Commission) to RTD.
This is the
recommended action.
2. Do not authorize the General Manager to execute all documents necessary to award a
contract to First Southwest, a division of Hill Top Securities to act as financial advisor (and
Municipal Advisor as defined by the Securities Exchange Commission) to RTD. This is not the
recommended action as it would not allow RTD to continue to manage it take advantage of
the interest expense savings currently available to the District.

Naming Rights Implementation

CFO/AGM,

Date: December 8, 2016
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: December 20, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
approve transferring $144,000 from the Board Appropriated Reserve to the Naming Rights
Implementation Project for signage and the 2016 commission to WME/ IMG.
BACKGROUND
On August 18, 2015, see attached, the Board of Director’s approved the sponsorship naming right
agreement with the University of Colorado for the sponsorship naming rights on the A line and an
exterior advertising position on the Flatiron Flyer for a five-year period with a mutually agreed upon right
to extend this agreement for an additional five years.
Over the initial five-year period, RTD would receive a gross amount of $5,000,696.
It was
recommended that the revenue from this contract be placed in the Board Appropriated Reserve. In the
first year of the agreement, a portion of the funds would be utilized for the implementation and
activation of the naming rights partner benefits including signage and updating of collateral materials. In
addition, the agent WME/IMG is entitled per contract to an annual payment of 12% of gross revenues.
DISCUSSION
The request will fund signs and the 2016 WME/ IMG commission. Attached as an addendum to this
report is the engineering diagram for the proposed signs. This design has been arrived at following
discussions with project engineers and facilities management staff about other options such as: signs on
railing, signs on windscreens and/or banners on light poles at each station platform; all of which resulted
in uncovering the fact that these other options did not meet engineering specifications for max wind
load [creating safety concerns] and being in conflict with RTD’s Art in Transit program.
These standalone signs are intended to be placed near the leading end of the platform in the direction of
travel. [e.g. western end of the west bound side and eastern end of the eastbound side]. There are to be
(2) signs per station [one per platform]. Content for these signs will be created by Univ. of Colorado.
RTD is responsible for the initial installation and maintenance. CU will responsible for subsequent
content changes; up to 4 changes per year per the rights and benefits associated with the naming rights
agreement.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact as those funds were placed in the Board Appropriated Fund to pay for
implementation and activation of the naming right partner benefits including signage and updating of
collateral materials. The agent WME/IMG is entitled to an annual payment of 12% of gross revenue.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the staff’s recommendation and complete the installation of signage and pay the annual
commission.

Packet Pg. 64

2. Do not accept the staff’s recommendation. If we don’t complete our requirements under
the contract it will jeopardize the ability to receive the remaining funds estimated at
approximately $4.5 million.

Audit Charter

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approves the attached Amended Audit Charter.
BACKGROUND
The Audit Charter is a formal document that defines the audit division’s activity, purpose, authority and
responsibility. It establishes Audit’s position within the organization, including reporting relationship
with the Board, authorizes access to records, personnel and physical properties relevant to performance
of engagements and defines the scope of audit activities. Final approval of the Audit Charter resides
with the Board.
DISCUSSION
The Audit function is engaged in Internal Audits and IT Audits, using either one of the function names
excludes the other so Audit will henceforth be referred to as RTD Audit, to be all inclusive.
The Scope of work has been expanded to include IT Audits and Investigations both of which Audit has
engaged in, but were not included in the previous Audit Charter.
The Independence and Accountability changes include adding the governing body for IT Auditing Information Systems Audit and Control Association, ISACA and eliminating the administrative reporting
requirement in line with the change of reporting responsibility to the General Manager and CEO, effective
January 2017.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
None.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit
Committee that the Board of Directors approves the attached amended Audit Charter.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not approve the amended Audit Charter. This action
is not recommended. RTD Audit is an independent, objective assurance and consulting activity
designed to add value and improve RTD's operations. The Audit Charter provides the foundation
upon which the Audit Activity is based; without which Audit could be deprived of independence
and objectivity.

Annual Audit Plan 2017

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approves the attached Annual Audit Plan for 2017.
BACKGROUND
The Annual Audit Plan has historically been approved by the General Manager and CEO and the Board of
Directors.
DISCUSSION
The Annual Audit Plan for 2017 includes several IT Audits and Internal Audits. The plan also includes
Follow-up Audits and a section containing Audit Requests that have not been prioritized for 2017.
The Annual Audit Plan is based on estimates of the time to complete the audits. As in past years it
utilizes every available business day. If time becomes available during the year Audit will refer to the
Board for approval of audits to be included as replacements.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
None.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Approve the Annual Audit Plan as presented. This is the recommended action. This will allow

2. Do not approve the Annual Audit Plan. This is not recommended. This Audit Plan was developed
after carefully selecting audits according to their potential to improve RTD’s policies and
procedures and contribute to the Goals and Objectives of the District. Delaying approval could
limit the days available for auditing and thereby reduce overall audit presence in the District.

DRCOG Vanpool Cost Share Agreement

RECOMMENDED ACTION
RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into an
Agreement with the Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) to provide RTD support for the
DRCOG Way to Go vanpool program in the Denver metropolitan area. This agreement is for calendar year
2017 and shall be in an amount not to exceed $1,058,600.

BACKGROUND
Vanpooling is a transportation option in which commuters/employees whose residences are
geographically clustered ride together to and from their work sites in a van that is driven and maintained
by one of the vanpool participants. Typically, the vans carry from six (6) to twelve (12) riders and are
provided by the vanpool program. Vanpools are organized to be sustainable and to render regular, ongoing service to vanpool members on a break-even, cost sharing, fare basis. Vanpools eliminate the costs
associated with dedicated drivers and expensive equipment.
As a transportation mode, vanpools provide personalized transportation at low cost and offer greater
opportunities for increased capacity as compared to carpooling. Vanpools also offer a cost-effective
alternative to conventional transit service in areas of low population density and longer commute
distances.

DISCUSSION
RTD has supported the DRCOG Way to Go vanpool program since 2001. The vanpool program had
previously experienced limited participation due to perceived high fares, insufficient funding for van
acquisition, difficulties in recruiting drivers, and the lack of funding to support necessary marketing
activities. In order to help overcome these barriers, the RTD and the DRCOG entered into a partnership in
April of 2001 to expand vanpool service in the Denver metropolitan area. In doing so, RTD and DRCOG
believed that the organizations could make meaningful advances toward meeting shared goals of offering
desirable mobility options, reducing traffic congestion, and improving air quality in the Denver
metropolitan area. Benefits for RTD include substantial cost savings from avoidance and/or replacement
of marginal bus routes with vanpools. Benefits to both RTD and DRCOG include complementary
marketing programs and increased commuter transportation alternatives.

Packet Pg. 87

2.11.I

RTD financial support is used to help underwrite the vanpool pricing structure in order to make vanpool
fares more competitive in the transportation marketplace. By subsidizing vanpool fares, vanpools are able
to compete with other transit alternatives and are perceived as a more attractive alternative for area
commuters. In addition, RTD support is used to provide incentives to attract and retain vanpool drivers
and to provide capital funding to acquire necessary rolling stock to provide vanpool services. Since the
advent of RTD support for the vanpool program in late 2001, the number of vans has grown from 11 to
122 active vans.
In 2009 the vanpool program became difficult to manage due to a shortage of DRCOG personnel.
DRCOG looked outside their agency at private companies operating vanpool services in other metropolitan
areas. After a competitive bid process, DRCOG choose VPSI to operate the vanpool program. VPSI took
over all operating aspects of the vanpool program. Currently the vanpools carry an average of 5.4 riders
per van and the fleet is at 76% capacity.
DRCOG vanpool performance through October in 2016 (thru the 3rd Qtr) resulted in an RTD subsidy per
passenger seat used of approximately $4.52 and $2.94 for each seat sold. For comparison, the subsidy
per passenger for RTD fixed route service in 2015 ranged from an average of $3.66 subsidy per
passenger for CBD local routes to an average of $7.18 subsidy per passenger for suburban local service
and an average of $5.17 subsidy per passenger for regional service.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for RTD support of the DRCOG Van pool program are budgeted in the approved 2017 budget.
Nothing herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this Agreement.

ALTERNATIVES
1.
Approve the financial support of the DRCOG Way to Go vanpool service in order to continue to
provide and expand this transportation option for residents of the Denver metropolitan area who
work/commute in the Denver metropolitan area.
2.
Do not approve the cost sharing agreement. This course of action is not recommended as it may
result in a reduction to or elimination of the DRCOG Way to Go vanpool program which would
result in an increase in single occupant commuting.

5311 Agreements

RECOMMENDED ACTION
RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into
funding agreements with Via Mobility Services and the Seniors’ Resource Center to provide RTD
financial support for the provision of FTA Section 5311 (non-urbanized) services for Boulder County,
Adams County and Jefferson County. These Agreements are for calendar year 2017 and for amounts
not to exceed $372,232.00 for Boulder County, $366.026.00 for Adams County and $113,411.00 for
Jefferson County.

BACKGROUND
The Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEALU), along with previous transit legislation, provides for the funding of transit services in non-urbanized,
or rural, areas. The section of the Act that addresses the provision of services in non-urbanized areas is
Section 5311 and thus these services are often referred to as “5311 service.” In 2013, SAFETEA-LU
provisions moved under the new Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21).
Since 1991, RTD has provided funding to various private, non-profit agencies to assist with the
provision of transit services in non-urbanized areas of the District and to provide local match money for
federal grant funds to support the provision of 5311 services in the District. RTD has provided
financial assistance for the provision of non-urbanized service in Jefferson County since 1991 and has
provided financial assistance for the provision of non-urbanized service in Adams and Boulder Counties
since 1993.

DISCUSSION
RTD will contribute funding to Via Mobility Services to support the provision of non-urbanized services
in Boulder County in an amount not to exceed $372,232.00 in 2017. RTD shall also contribute
funding to Via Mobility Services to support the provision of non-urbanized services in Adams County in
amount not to exceed $366,026.00 in 2017.
RTD shall contribute funding to Seniors’ Resource Center to support the provision of non-urbanized
services in Jefferson County in an amount not to exceed $113,411.00.00 in 2017.
These Agreements will be for a period of one year. 5311 performance will be assessed at the end of
the year to determine if performance expectations have been met and to determine if continuation of
the funding agreements is warranted. Performance will be evaluated in terms of RTD’s service
standards. If it appears that service performance will not warrant continuation, RTD and the affected
party(s) will confer on modifications needed to bring it into conformance. The provision of 5311
service in 2015 resulted in monthly performance that ranged from 1.6 to 2.2 passengers per hour

and an RTD subsidy per passenger boarding ranging from approximately $1.29 to approximately
$5.59 (subsidy reflects only the RTD contribution). As a comparison, RTD Call-n-Ride monthly
performance averaged 4.0 passengers per hour in 2015 while RTD Access-a-Ride service performs at
approximately 1.2 passengers per hour. Call-n-Ride performed at an average subsidy per passenger
boarding of $19.26 and Access-a-Ride performed at an average subsidy per passenger trip of
approximately $42.92 in 2015.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for RTD support of the 5311 services were included in the approved 2017 RTD budget. This
Agreement will be for a period of one year. Nothing herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this
Agreement.

ALTERNATIVES
1.
Approve the 5311 cost sharing agreements with Via Mobility Services and Seniors’ Resource
Center so that these organizations can continue to provide transit services to individuals in the
non-urbanized, rural areas of Boulder, Adams, and Jefferson counties.
2.
Do not approve the cost sharing agreement. This course of action is not recommended as it may
result in a reduction to or elimination of transit services in the non-urbanized, rural areas of
Boulder, Adams, and Jefferson counties.

Hop Cost Share Agreement

RECOMMENDED ACTION
RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into a
Cost Sharing Agreement with the City of Boulder to provide RTD financial support for the operation of
the HOP circulator bus service in the commercial areas of the City of Boulder, the University of
Colorado at Boulder and adjacent business and residential areas. This agreement is for calendar year
2017 and is for an amount not to exceed $1,454,514.00.

BACKGROUND
The City of Boulder has funded and provided circulator bus service, known as the HOP, within the City
of Boulder since October of 1994. This service provides mobility and access to the commercial areas of
the city, the University of Colorado at Boulder, and adjacent business and residential developments.
RTD also provides extensive bus service to/from and within the City of Boulder. RTD and the City of
Boulder have worked together to assure that these services are complementary and work together to
provide attractive and effective transit service for people living, studying and working in the area.
The HOP currently operates from 7:00 AM to 10:00 PM on weekdays, from 9:00 AM to 10:00 PM on
Saturdays, and from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM on Sundays and holidays. In addition, Night HOP service is
provided and funded entirely by the University of Colorado. Currently, the HOP provides approximately
2,800 passenger trips per weekday.

DISCUSSION
RTD will contribute funding to the City of Boulder to support the operation of the HOP in an amount
not to exceed $1,454,514.00 in 2017. This Agreement will be for a period of one year. HOP
performance will be assessed at the end of the year to determine if performance expectations have
been met and to determine if continuation of the cost sharing agreement is warranted. Performance will
be evaluated in terms of RTD’s service standards. If it appears that service performance does not
warrant continuation, RTD and the City of Boulder will confer on modifications to the service in order
to bring it into conformance. The provision of HOP service through 3rd Quarter in 2016 resulted in 24.3
passengers per hour and an RTD subsidy per HOP passenger trip of $1.77. For comparison, the
boardings for RTD local fixed route service in 2015 ranged from an average of 32.6 boardings per hour
for CBD local routes to an average of 17.7 boardings per hour for suburban local service.

Art Shuttle Cost Share Agreement

RECOMMENDED ACTION
RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into a Cost
Sharing Agreement with the City of Englewood to provide RTD financial support for the operation of the
art circulator bus service in the City of Englewood. This agreement is for calendar year 2017 and is for
an amount not to exceed $311,356.00.

BACKGROUND
In 2003 the City of Englewood applied for and received a Congestion Mitigation Air Quality (CMAQ)
Grant for a circulator bus service. This grant was approved with funding available 2004-2007. CMAQ
funds were approved for 80% of the cost of the service. RTD contributed 10% of the expense and the
City of Englewood contributed 10%. The art shuttle was implemented in 2004 as a free service. In
September 2007, with the expiration of the CMAQ grant, the RTD took over funding of the art shuttle
because the ridership exceeded RTD’s expectations. The City of Englewood continues the management
and marketing of the art shuttle. The City of Englewood covers all marketing and related expenses.
The art shuttle continues to be a free service that is sponsored by the City of Englewood. The City of
Englewood reimburses RTD for the fares that would have been paid if the art shuttle charged a RTD
fare.
The art shuttle currently operates from 6:30 AM to 6:30 PM on weekdays. There is no service on
Saturdays, Sundays or holidays. The shuttle operates between the Englewood light rail station and
Swedish Medical Center/Craig Hospital. The art shuttle operates as a free shuttle on a fifteen (15)
minute frequency. Ridership has averaged 636.0 boardings per day or 25.5 passengers per hour.

DISCUSSION
RTD will contribute funding to the City of Englewood to support the operation of the art shuttle in an
amount not to exceed $311,356 in 2017
This Agreement will be for a period of one year. The performance of the art shuttle will be assessed at
the end of the year to determine if performance expectations have been met and to determine if
continuation of the cost sharing agreement is warranted. Performance will be evaluated in terms of
RTD’s service standards. If it appears that service performance will not warrant continuation, RTD and
the City of Englewood will confer on modifications to the service in order to bring it into conformance.
The provision of art shuttle service through the 3rd Quarter in 2015 resulted in 25.5 passengers per hour
and an RTD subsidy per art shuttle passenger trip of $1.29. For comparison, the boardings for RTD local
fixed route suburban service in 2015 was 17.7 boardings per hour with a subsidy of $7.18 per boarding.
The City of Englewood will continue to pay for all fares for the art shuttle.

herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this Agreement.

service so that the City of Englewood can continue to provide this service to the residents,
visitors and businesses in the City of Englewood.

Authorization to enter into contract with
Nordco Mobile Railcar Movers (16DR004)

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorizes the General Manager or his designee to enter into a contract with Nordco Mobile Railcar
Movers for the purchase of a LRV Recovery Vehicle in the amount of $550,360.00.
BACKGROUND:
When RTD prepared to open the first Light Rail line in 1994, we purchased a 1984 Mercedes-Benz
Unimog to move single LRVs in rail yards and on rail lines that did not yet have overhead power. This
type of vehicle was the Industry standard for moving LRVs in rail yards across the country. RTD also
used this vehicle to tow LRVs on new lines for clearance and overhead wire position testing. RTD
learned that the Unimog was not large enough to efficiently and safely tow our 88,000 lb. LRV’s on 6%
percent grades and the tight curves that exist on our rail lines. Having a Brakeman on board the LRV is
the only way to tow safely and still doesn’t solve the lack of towing effort needed to go up steep
grades.
RTD initially issued a Request for Proposals on August 26, 2016. Evaluative criteria were cost- 50%,
conformance with specifications- 30%, supplier’s history and proven track record with this equipment10%, and quality of references- 10%. RTD’s evaluation committee consisted of Robbie Hunter, Senior
Equipment Engineer; Phil Eberl, General Superintendent, LRV Maintenance; Tim Walker, Manager, LRV
Maintenance; and Leo Fautsch, Senior Buyer.
RTD received two proposals; one from Nordco and one from Colmar. The evaluation committee
recommends Nordco, the proposer that met our specification and was the only one that met our
evaluation criteria.
DISCUSSION:
A larger rail car mover is the only feasible way to recover trains from the mainline and to tow LRVs. This
mover will also be used by our Maintenance of Way group to tow their ballast car as needed. The
proposed mover could retrieve two to four LRVs at a time.
It will have a 30,000lb winch installed to aid in derailment retrievals and couplers for LRV retrieval. Most
Light Rail properties in the U.S. have a larger LRV mover capable of towing multiple LRVs in the event of
a major accident or power failure on the line in order to recover their trains and return them to the rail
yard.
The existing Unimog is obsolete, undersized and almost impossible to purchase parts for due to its age.
A newer model of the same vehicle is not available in the U.S. due to EPA regulations. The proposed
vehicle exceeds the tractive effort (pulling power) of common Track Mobiles.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The cost of the Recovery Vehicle is in the Rail Operations capital budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorizes the General Manager or his designee to enter into a contract with Nordco Mobile Railcar

Packet Pg. 95

2.11.M

Movers for the purchase of a LRV Recovery Vehicle in the amount of $550,360.00. This is the
recommended alternative.
2. Do not authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute a contract with Nordco for
purchase of a Railcar Mover. This action would result in RTD’s inability to efficiently and safely
retrieve LRVs on rail lines absent of overhead power and could not be shared by MOW for the
movement of their ballast car. This is not the recommended action as it would not allow us to
improve our ability to efficiently move or recover LRVs on dead track sections.

Code of Conduct for Persons on RTD Vehicles
and Property

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the attached Code of Conduct for persons on RTD vehicles and property.
BACKGROUND:
Since its founding, RTD has not had a written code of conduct that describes acceptable behavior for
individuals on RTD vehicles and property. Many other transit agencies including Los Angeles, Atlanta,
Dallas, and New York City have such codes to promote public safety, health, and peace. Codes help
passengers and visitors understand acceptable behavior, and help transit agencies communicate and, if
necessary, enforce such behavior.
A 2016 RTD Leadership Academy group has been working on a campaign to educate RTD users on
courtesy to fellow passengers, to help make everyone’s ride more enjoyable. While working on this
project the Leadership Academy group identified the need for RTD to have a formal Code of Conduct.
RTD currently has a Facilities Use Policy posted on RTD’s website. However, that policy applies solely to
RTD real property, and focuses mainly on commercial activity and First Amendment issues concerning
non-commercial activity. RTD’s Trailblazer contains requirements for passenger conduct, but the
Trailblazer is an operator’s guide, not instructions to the public. Historically, verbal guidance and
directions from RTD security and staff have sufficed to maintain acceptable behavior, but recently RTD
Transit Police officers have been challenged to “show me the rule” when they ask patrons to refrain
from disruptive activities. The attached Code of Conduct will provide clear and consistent answers and
guidance to RTD Transit Police, other RTD staff, and RTD patrons.
The Code has been written to avoid infringing on the public’s First Amendment rights, and to respect the
rights of disabled persons under the Americans with Disabilities Act. For example, the Code restricts
disruptively loud noises or unsanitary practices, but does not try to regulate what people say or wear.
The Code also emphasizes that it is subject to reasonable modification if otherwise prohibited conduct is
due to a disability, and directs RTD staff to consult with RTD Dispatch or Security for advice in such
cases.
The Code reflects that RTD does not intend to use it to punish violations. Instead, RTD will continue to
enforce its standards of behavior in a compassionate and sensible manner, with an emphasis on
education and warnings whenever it is practicable to do so. If a patron violates the Code and refuses to
stop even after a warning, or in extreme cases where immediate action must be taken without a prior
warning, the Code will aid RTD Transit Police and other staff to direct the patron to leave the premises
or face trespassing charges.

Packet Pg. 97

2.11.N

The Code does not alter or replace existing applicable laws, such as criminal violations for “Endangering
Public Transportation,” “Hindering Public Transportation,” and assault.
RTD has developed the Code after review of similar codes by peer transit agencies including those
mentioned above, and with input from the Senior Leadership Team, RTD’s Civil Rights Division, and
other RTD staff. An initial draft of the Code was provided to the Operations Committee on November 1,
2016 for review and comment. The Code has also undergone substantial outreach with stakeholder
groups, including input sought from the Colorado Coalition for the Homeless, the Colorado CrossDisability Coalition, the American Civil Liberties Union, the Downtown Denver Business Improvement
District, and other local entities. Numerous suggestions by these groups have been included in the final
draft.
Rollout, education and publicity on the Code is anticipated to be done in conjunction with the Leadership
Academy education program.
The Code will be posted on RTD’s website and made available in pamphlet form, and RTD security and
operations staff will be trained in its provisions and enforcement. RTD staff will also educate individuals
on the Code while performing ongoing security, operations and maintenance functions.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
The cost to implement the Code of Conduct will be very minimal, and a Code will help protect RTD
against legal claims based on arbitrary RTD conduct.
ALTERNATIVES:
1. Accept the Recommended Action and approve the attached Code of Conduct. This is
recommended, because RTD staff needs a comprehensive code of conduct to educate the public
and, if necessary, enforce appropriate behavior.
2. Reject the Recommended Action and do not approve the attached Code of Conduct. This is not
recommended, since RTD will continue to have no written, easy to find, and easy to apply rules
governing behavior of RTD passengers and others; and legal challenges may be filed against RTD
staff issuing directives not based on written policies.

Local Government Liaison Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Government Relations Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the
General Manager to enter into Contract No. 16-DO-025 for Local Government Liaison services with CRL
Associates, Inc. (CRL) for three years (January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2019), at a cost of
$102,000 per year, and for two (2) additional one-year options to renew at prices specified in the
Contract, each option period contingent upon approval by the Board of Directors pursuant to the
Contract Award agreement.
BACKGROUND
In September 2016, RTD issued a Request for Proposals for Local Government Liaison Services. Eight
potential bidders looked at the RFP, but only one responded to this request. The procurement panel is
recommending to the Government Relations Committee the selection of CRL Associates, Inc. as RTD’s
Local Government Liaison with the elected officials and staff of the cities and counties of the Denver
metropolitan area, as well as the business community and economic development organizations. This
team has broad knowledge of RTD’s needs and concerns, as well as an extensive network of
relationships with local governments, elected officials, and stakeholders along the Front Range. The
proposal was submitted for the period of January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2019, with the
potential for two (2) one-year option periods. The Government Relations Committee will make future
annual recommendations to the Board of Directors at the end of each contract period regarding the
exercise of future option periods.
DISCUSSION
CRL Associates, Inc. as RTD’s Local Government Liaison maintains contact with the elected officials and
staff of the cities and counties of the Denver metropolitan area, as well as the business community and
economic development organizations. This team has a broad knowledge of RTD’s needs and concerns,
as well as an extensive network of relationships with local governments, elected officials, and
stakeholders along the Front Range.
As part of the Local Government Liaison services, frequent contact will be made with RTD staff and the
Chairman of the Board to ascertain a coordinated plan to monitor and report on activities at the city and
county levels of government. In addition, as part of the coordinated plan, CRL will provide regular
outreach to the business community and economic development organizations in the Metro area to
develop partnerships and garner feedback on RTD issues of concern.
CRL will represent RTD at meetings at the local level of government and provide professional advice,
counsel, and analysis of issues regarding local government activities as they relate to RTD. CRL will also
provide Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) liaison services.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for 2017 is included in the annual budget and future years will be included in the respective
annual budgets.

at a cost of $102,000 per year, and for two (2) additional one-year options to renew at prices
specified in the Contract, each option period contingent upon approval by the Board of Directors
pursuant to the Contract Award agreement.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. A new Request for Proposals could be sent to
interested parties, and a new Local Government Liaison firm could be retained. This action is not
recommended because CRL Associates, Inc. has been very effective in assisting RTD with local
government matters in the past, and this group is very familiar with RTD’s issues and policies.
This option is also not recommended because a valid RFP process was utilized for this
procurement.

Federal Liaison Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the RTD Government Relations Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager to enter into an agreement for federal liaison services with Squire Patton
Boggs LLP to exercise a one-year option (January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017) to extend
Contract No. 14-DX-001, at a cost of $264,000. Funding for this contract is included in the 2017
budget.
BACKGROUND
A solicitation for proposals for Federal Liaison Services was issued on August 12, 2014. This
solicitation was a Best Value Procurement where technical factors and cost were all considered. Ten
responsive proposals were received, and they were evaluated by a five-member evaluation committee
that recommended Squire Patton Boggs LLP. The recommendation of the evaluation committee was
subsequently referred to the Government Relations Committee on November 11, 2014.
The
Government Relations Committee recommended that Squire Patton Boggs LLP be offered a new contract
for a five-year period. Squire Patton Boggs has been RTD’s federal lobbyist since 2000 and has assisted
in RTD’s receiving over $2.5 billion in federal grants and loans. In addition to constant monitoring of
Congressional and Executive Branch activities, status reports are issued and special reports are prepared
when significant events occur in the federal government.
DISCUSSION
Constant monitoring of federal legislative activities that relate to RTD is required, and RTD’s interests
must be conveyed to appropriate members of Congress, including the Colorado delegation and other key
Congressional committee members. The Squire Patton Boggs team has excellent rapport and respect
from the Colorado delegation and serves as a resource for the delegation staff. When RTD has a Full
Funding Grant Agreement (FFGA) in place as it now does (Eagle P3 Project), the annual appropriations
process requires intense attention to committee hearings and to the status of the Congressional budget
process. In addition, in 2016 RTD received a $92 million Full Funding Grant Agreement for the
Southeast Rail Extension (SERE), which entailed extensive contacts with the Colorado Congressional
delegation. Significant lobbying efforts were required to follow the steps to ensure being awarded the
annual appropriations in the current Eagle P3 FFGA, as well as procuring the SERE FFGA.
The MAP-21 Continuing Resolution expired on May 31, 2015, and the federal lobbyists played a key role
in representing RTD’s needs in the new authorization bill—Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act
(FAST Act). With the build out of FasTracks, the lobbyists will need to be especially attentive to the
federal financing needs for the unfunded corridors, and they will monitor the possibility of new funding
sources in the FAST Act and advocate for RTD’s best interests.
In addition to helping with Congressional activities, assistance is also necessary with the Executive
Branch of the federal government, including the Department of Transportation (the Federal Transit
Administration and the Federal Railroad Administration). Squire Patton Boggs provides guidance and
assistance in applying for and receiving federal funds from the Department of Transportation.

Packet Pg. 108

2.12.P

For the American Public Transportation Association (APTA) Legislative Conference in March each year,
Squire Patton Boggs staff advises which offices are critical to visit or are of relevant interest for
board/staff visits. Then, the Squire Patton Boggs team sets the meeting times on behalf of RTD.
The Denver office of Squire Patton Boggs serves as important advisory role in RTD’s connection to
relevant national personnel and issues. In addition, annually, or as required, meetings with the Board of
Directors are also held.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Government Relations Committee’s Recommended Action to exercise a one-year
option (January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017) at a cost of $264,000 ($22,000 per
month) with Squire Patton Boggs LLP.
2. Continue the contract on a month-to-month basis, if amenable to the current Contractor
(Squire Patton Boggs LLP). This option is not recommended because continuity and stability
in liaison services is an important consideration.
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action and issue a new Request for Proposals (RFP) for
Federal Liaison Services. This option is not recommended because RTD’s RFP process was
properly utilized for this procurement.

Option to Purchase Real Property at 29072915 Welton Street

Assistant

General

Board Meeting Date: December 20, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorizes the General Manager and/or his designee to negotiate and execute all documents necessary
for the grant of an option, and for the sale of the real property located at 2907-2915 Welton Street,
Denver Colorado (the “Property”), including execution of any deeds and other property conveyance
documents.
BACKGROUND
This action addresses the 2016 goal of fiscal sustainability in leveraging RTD assets by selling property
no longer needed by the District for fair market value, and addresses the policy goals of Resolution 17 in
2010, the TOD Strategic Plan by supporting creation of mixed-income housing near transit stations.
RTD originally acquired the property at 29th and Welton in 1993 to replace the on-street parking for local
businesses that was lost during the construction of the Central Corridor LRT. The property is currently a
vacant parking lot used for neighborhood retail parking and is not managed as part of RTD’s parking
management system.
In 2010, the RTD Board adopted the TOD Strategic Plan to create a more focused policy that guides
RTD’s role in encouraging the creation of mixed-income communities near transit. The Board also
approved the TOD Pilot Program to test implementing the new TOD Strategic Plan. Pursuant to that
policy direction, RTD selected the Welton corridor as a Pilot Program site because of a combination of
favorable market conditions for redevelopment and the City and County of Denver’s (the “City’s”)
commitment to revitalization of the Welton Corridor.
In 2013, the Five Points Business District published its Vision Plan Implementation & Revitalization
Strategy, which called for removal of vacant parking lots along the corridor including activation of RTD’s
29th and Welton property. The plan emphasizes the need to retain housing affordability in the Welton
corridor.
Beginning in 2014, RTD staff and the Denver Office of Economic Development (OED) began discussions
around how to partner to implement the community vision established in the Five Points Business
District plan as part of the RTD Pilot Program implementation. In addition, Mayor Hancock has signaled
his eagerness to continue to collaborate with RTD on a new model for mixed-income condominium
construction that helps to achieve the City’s 3x5 Initiative to create or preserve 3,000 affordable homes
in five years by 2018. A letter from Mayor Hancock expressing the City’s commitment to this project is
included in the Board packet, including the City’s willingness to contribute substantial gap financing to
support an appropriate development on the 29th and Welton site.

RTD and the City have outlined a potential competitive process to solicit developers to build a mixedincome condominium project on the Property. OED would lead the RFQ process, but RTD would
participate in the selection panel. To aid in the successful completion of the developer selection, RTD
and the City need to establish certainty for potential bidders that the property will be available at
previously agreed upon terms. Accordingly, RTD staff request authority to grant an option to purchase
the Property now so that when the City issues the RFQ, it can represent that it holds a right to purchase
the property under the terms of an option agreement.
DISCUSSION
This action would give authority to grant the City and County of Denver an option to purchase the
Property1. In order to exercise the option and complete the purchase, the following conditions must be
met first:
i) successful procurement of a development partner to build a mixed-income condominium
project according to the terms agreed upon by RTD and the City;
ii) the selected developer reaching an agreement on business terms with the City; and
iii) the selected developer securing the financing necessary to complete the project.
The City would also have the right to assign the option to the selected developer, meaning the selected
developer could purchase the property directly from RTD on the same terms as the City and subject to
the same conditions. The term of the option would be two years from the date of its execution, with
the ability to grant two ninety-day extensions if necessary to complete the transaction. The final
purchase price for the Property will be based on a fair market value appraisal of the Property.
If the City fails to exercise the option during the option period, RTD would remain the property owner
and any subsequent decisions about the Property would come back to the Board for approval.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
RTD currently spends approximately $10,000 per year maintaining the property. If the property is sold,
RTD will no longer have this maintenance obligation. If the Option is exercised, RTD will receive the
amount determined by a fair market value appraisal of the Property.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning and Development
Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorizes the General Manager and/or his designee
to negotiate and execute all documents necessary for the grant of an option, and for the sale of
the real property located at 2907-2915 Welton Street, Denver Colorado (the “Property”),
including execution of any deeds and other property conveyance documents.
2. Do not authorize the General Manager and/or his designee to negotiate and execute all documents
necessary for the conveyance of an Option to Purchase the Real Property located at 2907-2915
Welton Street, Denver CO. This is not recommended because RTD does not have any current or
future transit need for the property, and because this would be inconsistent with the goals of the
TOD pilot program previously approved by the Board in December of 2010.

An option to purchase property is the right, but not the obligation, to purchase the property at any time
during the term of the option according to the terms of the option.

Board of Directors
Regional Transportation District
1600 Blake Street
Denver, CO 80202
To the RTD Board of Directors:
This letter is to express the City and County of Denver’s strong and enthusiastic support for the
proposal before you to approve an option agreement between RTD and the city to acquire the
RTD-owned property at 2907-2915 Welton Street for the development of mixed-income
housing.
Since the fall of 2014, Denver’s Office of Economic Development (OED) has been working
closely with the RTD Transit-Oriented Development team to plan for the development of
mixed-income for-sale housing on this site. We look forward to continuing to collaborate on
this joint effort to provide critical affordable homeownership opportunities in the Five Points
neighborhood.
OED’s mission is to advance economic prosperity for the city and its businesses, neighborhoods
and residents. As part of this mission, OED invests federal and local funds in the development
and preservation of a variety of income-qualified housing throughout the city. Each year, OED
invests millions of dollars of gap financing in non-profit and private-sector-led development
projects that add to the city’s stock of affordable housing.
Housing costs in the Denver region are rising out of reach for even moderate-income residents,
with an estimated 100,000 households in Denver County alone paying more than 30% of their
income for housing costs. We recognize the need to invest in affordable housing options not
only to provide shelter for our region’s most vulnerable residents, but also to support the
economic mobility of Denver’s low- and moderate-income families as they become ready to
move into homeownership. To achieve this goal, OED invests in affordable housing units
ranging from supportive housing for the lowest-income residents to for-sale units for
households earning up to the median income.

2.12.Q.b

Due partly to construction defects restrictions, very few for-sale units have been built in Denver
over the last several years, limiting the entry-level housing options available to lower- and
moderate-income homebuyers. The city is eager to continue to collaborate with RTD and a
mutually selected developer to pilot on this site a new model for mixed-income condominium
construction at this location. We are prepared to contribute substantial gap financing to an
appropriate development on this site to support this effort.
Attachment: 2016-11-28 Letter - RTD Board - 29th Welton (2976 : 2907-2915 Welton Street)

We look forward to the opportunity to continue to deepen and strengthen our relationship
with RTD as a key partner in innovative development throughout Denver.

Michael B. Hancock

2.12.Q.c

Economic & Planning Systems, Inc.

Economic & Planning Systems (EPS) evaluated two land disposition options for the RTD owned
parcels at 29th and Welton. The site is currently used as a RTD parking lot. The first option is a
land sale, where RTD transfers ownership to a buyer in exchange for a lump sum payment. The
second is a ground lease, where a land lessee pays RTD a fee to use the land for a set term. At
the end of the term, RTD takes control of the land and any buildings on it. EPS evaluated the
disposition options on two criteria: (1) the potential limitations on land uses and corresponding
policy goals and (2) the potential monetary value to RTD. In the first criterion, the evaluation
found that the ground lease option limits the potential for residential product in general and
likely precludes residential homeownership. In the second, the evaluation found that the land
sale and ground lease generate similar values.

Land Use Limitations
The ground lease option poses distinct challenges as it relates to housing affordability goals.
Ground leases generally preclude residential ownership products like condominiums. As a result,
this disposition option would limit RTD’s ability to create affordable homeownership on the site.
Moreover, ground leases often increase the interest rate on mortgages for potential buyers,
further complicating affordability. Finally, the market for residential ground leases limits the pool
of prospective developers, creating an additional layer of complexity for lenders and investors. A
weak ground lease market may also reduce the potential value of this option.

Value
In addition to policy considerations, EPS estimated the potential value to RTD for both options.
Based on conservative assumptions, EPS found the option yield almost identical values for RTD
of approximately $1.4 million. The valuation methodology is described briefly:
•

•

Land Sale: EPS evaluated 26 comparable land sales within a one-mile radius of the site
completed since 2010. Based on these comparable transactions, a low, moderate, and
high range of price was established. Based on these prices, EPS estimates a price range
between $1 million and $1.7, with $1.4 million representing the mid-range estimate.
Ground Lease: EPS calculated a present value of the potential stream of cash flows. In
contrast to a land sale, a ground lease tenant pays RTD an annual fee to use the land.
The fee is typically based on a percentage of the land value (around 6.0 percent), and
ground leases typically last 50 or 99 years, with the latter being more common. The long
term nature of the lease allows the tenant to earn a return on any investment or land
improvement. Present value allows for apples-to-apples comparison, translating the
stream of cash values into 2016 dollars. Based on these terms, EPS estimates a range of
values between $1 million and 1.7 million, with a midrange of $1.4 million.

While the two options generate comparable values in most scenarios, EPS found more upside to
ground leases in optimistic scenarios. However, RTD must balance this potential premium with
the policy limitations and market constraints posed by the ground lease. In other words, the
objective of developing affordable ownership condominiums can be accomplished most
effectively with a land sale.

Parking Guiding Principles

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors pass the
attached parking guiding principles resolution to provide policy direction to RTD staff on parking related
issues moving forward.
BACKGROUND
RTD has over 29,000 parking spaces serving its transit system. About 20 percent of RTD riders park at
one of RTD’s park and ride facilities to access the transit system so it represents a significant contingent
of RTD’s ridership. RTD’s ability to manage our parking resources is governed by RTD’s enabling
legislation (C.R.S. Section 32-9-119.9) and there is limited internal policy guidance available for staff to
utilize in analyzing and making decisions on parking related projects.
DISCUSSION
RTD’s recent experience with third party parking agreements has resulted in inconsistencies in the
management and operation of shared facilities. This inconsistency creates challenges for RTD staff to
implement RTD’s current parking management program and complicates issues when considering third
party approaches to potentially charging for parking.
For joint development projects, there is limited guidance in RTD’s Strategic Plan for TOD (2010) about
how to deal with replacement parking. It would benefit staff to have clearly identified criteria to
consider when working on projects involving parking replacement. In addition, RTD’s approach to station
access, which includes the provision of parking, is done with limited policy guidance. Having clear
policy guidance on station access would help with in developing a holistic, balanced approach to the
planning and implementation of station improvements.
It would therefore be beneficial to have guiding principles to provide a base level of direction to staff in
day to day dealings with parking issues. Draft parking guiding principles were presented at the
November 1st P&D Committee meeting. Board feedback on the draft principles was provided at the
meeting.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no expected direct financial impact of this resolution. This resolution requires that financial
implications be considered as part of any decision related to RTD parking.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors pass
the attached parking guiding principles resolution to provide policy direction to RTD staff on
parking related issues moving forward.
2. Do not adopt resolution. Continue to operate with limited policy guidance and allow for
continued inconsistency with parking decisions.

Performance Evaluation

Manager's

2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee that the
Board of Directors approve the General Manager’s performance appraisal for 2016 as defined in the
attached completed General Manager’s Performance Evaluation Form. Although the Board feels you
have achieved or exceeded your overall goals for the 2016 Performance Appraisal, with current public
perception and extenuating circumstances with launch of the Commuter rail along with the challenges
with Smart Card implementation the recommendation is not to award a discretionary payout for 2016.
BACKGROUND
The General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee works with the General
Manager to enhance its oversight responsibilities for the General Manager’s performance and to develop
processes that are approved by the full Board and are transparent to the public.
On July 20, 2010, the Board approved the goal setting process for the General Manager. That process
defines the steps the Board will follow in establishing the annual goals for the General Manager.
Beginning in 2011, these goals include core and task goals. Core goals are based on the General
Manager’s job description and are generally considered part of the ongoing responsibilities of the General
Manager. The task goals are a compilation of the priorities from the annual joint Board and staff
Advance Planning Session that occurs at the beginning of each year for the following year.
One of the steps in the process is to formalize the General Manager’s annual goals using the same
salaried employee performance evaluation form that is used by the rest of the RTD employees. That
process was used in the 2016 GM performance appraisal process.
The General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee Chair and the full committee
have moved through the process of the 2016 performance evaluation utilizing the policies set on July
10, 2010 through a recommendation by the State Audit Committee.
DISCUSSION
Listed below are the 2016 Core and Task goals the General Manager was evaluated against along with
the Self and Committee Assessment results.
