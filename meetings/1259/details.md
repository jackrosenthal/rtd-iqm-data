Discussion:              General Manager Washington introduced Julio Rivera, ATU President, who expressed his thanks to the negotiating team and to General Manager Washington.  The agreement passed with a union vote of 95% to 5%.  Julio expressed that they had focused on some tough issues like preservation of the pension and strengthening the health benefits.  They were also able to afford a modest pay increase to their employees.

General Manager Washington thanked Julio for his words and thanked Julio and his negotiating team as well.  They shared a common goal to negotiate a fair contract with emphasis in areas that were important to the employees.  The 95% acceptance rate by the union employees for this unprecedented 5-year agreement speaks to the integrity of their process and the willingness to work together.  He is especially appreciative of the fact this did not get negotiated in the media but at the table where it fully belonged.  This contract is for the good of the employees and the good of the district.

Chair Anderson thanked both teams for a job well done.  She related a story of meeting an employee on Sunday morning who had just voted and was overjoyed about this contract.  RTD is about our employees and doing the right thing.
