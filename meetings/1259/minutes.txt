Discussion:

General Manager Washington introduced Julio Rivera, ATU President,
who expressed his thanks to the negotiating team and to General
Manager Washington. The agreement passed with a union vote of
95% to 5%. Julio expressed that they had focused on some tough
issues like preservation of the pension and strengthening the health
benefits. They were also able to afford a modest pay increase to
their employees.
General Manager Washington thanked Julio for his words and
thanked Julio and his negotiating team as well. They shared a
common goal to negotiate a fair contract with emphasis in areas that
were important to the employees. The 95% acceptance rate by the
union employees for this unprecedented 5-year agreement speaks to
the integrity of their process and the willingness to work together.
He is especially appreciative of the fact this did not get negotiated in
the media but at the table where it fully belonged. This contract is
for the good of the employees and the good of the district.
Chair Anderson thanked both teams for a job well done. She related
a story of meeting an employee on Sunday morning who had just

voted and was overjoyed about this contract. RTD is about our
employees and doing the right thing.

Other Matters
Director Daly thanked the 6 Board members who attended the tour of the District
shops that he hosted last week. He hoped it was beneficial and they learned
