BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Allied Universal Security Services Second Contract Option
Year

May 10, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
May 23, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO), or her designee, to
execute the second option year of the existing security services contract with Allied Universal Security
(AUS) for a total cost not to exceed $20,455,408.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Dr. Joel Fitzgerald, Chief of Police and Emergency Management
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
The current RTD security model consists of internal police officers, secondary employment officers from
local jurisdictions, and contracted security officers to provide security for RTD customers, facilities, and
property.
On July 11, 2019, following a comprehensive procurement process, AUS was awarded a three-year
contract with three one-year options to provide system-wide security services. The initial contract term
expired June 30, 2022, and RTD executed the first option year term from July 1, 2022, to June 30,
2023. A second option year term would further extend the contract from July 1, 2023, to June 30,
2024.
Currently, the range of services provided under the contract terms include but are not limited to:
• Critical infrastructure security at RTD facilities including bus and rail stations
• Fare enforcement
• Patrol services
• Enhanced security presence during large-scale events
• Integrated security technology services
• Security command and dispatch center staffing and monitoring
DISCUSSION
Staff recommends that the Board authorize the GM/CEO to execute the second option year of the three
one-year options for AUS to continue providing system-wide security services.
In adopting this recommended action, the agency seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan priorities
of Community Value and Customer Excellence. Specifically:

Packet Pg. 3

1.D.1

• The perceived value of RTD in terms of Community Value would be enhanced through:
o The hiring of additional unarmed security officers to serve in ambassador and customer
service roles, and
o Continued deployment of contracted security personnel in higher visibility uniforms,
yielding a greater sense of employee, customer, and overall community security in areas
RTD serves.
• Increased Customer Excellence would be achieved through the continued ability to deploy
unarmed security guards on commuter rail services, thereby improving system reliability and
decreasing delays
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The financial impact associated with the adoption of the recommended action is $20,455,408, of which
$10,227,704 will be accounted for within the FY2023 Amended Budget. The remaining funds require
incorporation into the FY2024 Budget. Moreover, due to the reduction in the scope of services over the
life of the contract, the cost of the second option year is $4,256,448 less than the original projected
cost for this option year.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
September 2023 Service Change Proposals

May 10, 2023

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Ford, Chief Operations Officer
Jessie Carter, Senior Manager, Service Development
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 minutes
BACKGROUND
Commensurate with the service change and voting process detailed in the Collective Bargaining
Agreement between RTD and the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1001 (ATU), the September 2023
Service Change Proposal facilitates both an opportunity for RTD bus and rail operators to vote new work
assignments and the opportunity for Service Development staff to adjust the operations plan for RTD’s
transit network.
Current weekday ridership averages slightly more than 175,000 daily boardings on the transit network.
With the coming fall/winter school year, ridership demand is anticipated to increase. Efforts to increase
staffing levels have continued, resulting in positive increases in both recruitment and retention.
However, rail and bus operations staffing levels remain lower than budgeted headcount, which limits the
capacity to increase service, as proposed in the Board-approved System Optimization Plan (SOP).
DISCUSSION
The proposals herein include a mix of service improvements and adjustments aimed at further
implementation of the SOP and adapting service to ridership demands. Notable plans herein include
adopted SOP proposals: restructuring the Route 16/16G – West Colfax/Golden service, reintroduction of
select trips on the Route GS – Boulder/Golden service and service level improvements consistent with
the SOP on Routes 65, 73 and 105. Along with routine schedule adjustments to improve service
reliability, the service plan will reinstate school-related services that were paused for summer 2023.
In alignment with Strategic Plan Priorities, relating most directly to Customer Excellence, and recognizing
the RTD’s workforce challenges, the proposals herein are directed at improving on-time performance,
maintaining compliance with the agency’s Collective Bargaining Agreement with ATU, and adjusting
service levels to match fall/winter ridership demand.
The Board-adopted guidance for proposed service changes continue to be:
• Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
• The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;

Packet Pg. 5

1.E.1

•
•
•
•

The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
Response to changes in the communities where services are provided

A summary of the list of service proposals is provided herein and further detailed in Attachment A.
Supplemental information related to the SOP is included in Attachments B, C, D, E and F.

16 and Route 16G.

Route 16 – West Colfax/16G – Golden
Current on-time performance: 84.7% on time, 11.4% late
Current ridership is 28 boardings per hour weekdays, 26.5 boardings per hour Saturdays,
23.6 boardings per hour Sundays
As described in the Systems Operations Plan (SOP), Route 16 will be split into two distinct
service patterns, identified as Routes 16 and 16G. The new Route 16 pattern operates
between 16th•Lincoln and Oak Station. The 16G pattern will provide service between Oak
Station, Federal Center Station and 10th•Washington in Golden.
The results of the introduction of the new patterns will reduce service midday between
Oak Station and Downtown Golden on weekends. Conversely, this proposal improves ontime performance on the West Colfax alignment, by reducing distance between
terminals/recovery areas. The proposal also aims to improve network connectivity with
increased transfer opportunities at Oak and Federal Center stations. (See attachment B)
