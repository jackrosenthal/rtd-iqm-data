GENERAL MANAGER’S REPORT

VIII.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT
A.

Recommendation for Contract Award to Parsons Transportation Group for the
Southeast Corridor Extension Environmental Evaluation/Basic Engineering (EE/BE)
Contract
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager to award a contract to Parsons Transportation
Group to perform an Environmental Evaluation study and Basic Engineering for the
Southeast Corridor Extension project. The contract award will be in the amount of
$2,073,699. Funding for this contract is included in the 2008 Adopted Budget for the
Southeast Corridor Extension project and in the FasTracks financial plan for 2009 and
2010.

B.

Recommendation for Contract Award to Parsons Transportation Group for the
Southwest Corridor Extension Environmental Evaluation/Basic Engineering (EE/BE)
Contract
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager to award a contract to Parsons Transportation
Group (PTG) to perform an Environmental Evaluation (EE) study and Basic Engineering
(BE) for the Southwest Corridor Extension project. The contract award will be in the
amount of $2,193,669.
It is also recommended by the Planning & Development Committee that the RTD Board
of Directors authorize the General Manager to transfer $600,000 from the FasTracks
Contingency Reserve to provide the full funding for the 2008 portion of the contract.
This action is required because the funds appropriated in the 2008 RTD Budget were
not sufficient to cover both the costs of the EE/BE and the cost of the Lucent property
acquisition. However, the total funding for this contract and the property acquisition is
included in the overall Southwest Corridor Extension Project budget as part of the
FasTracks Financial Plan for 2008 – 2010. The 2008 Budget Amendment process will
address the budget allocation issue and restore the FasTracks Contingency Reserve.

IX.

C.

IT Consultant – Universe/Legacy Programmers (Exercise Second Year Option)
It is recommended by the Finance/Administration Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager to execute all documents necessary to exercise the
second one year option in the amount of $300,000 to extend the current contract for
non-personal services for an IT Consultant-UniVerse/Legacy Programmer (16DK001).
This contract was originally awarded May 1st, 2006 to 5280 Solutions, LLC (a WSCA
company) through the competitive bid process. The contract allowed for an initial year
plus three one year options to renew based on positive performance by the vendor. The
total contract amount with this option year requires Board approval. The second one
year option is to begin on May 1, 2008 and remain in effect for one year until April 30,
2009.

D.

Exercise the Option to Purchase 99 Replacement and 44 Expansion access-a-Ride
Cutaway Buses
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that the RTD Board
of Directors authorize the General Manager to exercise the option to purchase 99
replacement and 44 expansion cutaway buses to be used by access-a-Ride. The option
price is not to exceed $52,000 each for a total award not to exceed $7,436,000.

E.

Fares Adjustments for Special Services
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that RTD’s fare
structure for special services (RockiesRide, BroncosRide, BuffRide, RunRide, CU/CSU
Football games at Invesco Field and Race for the Cure) be adjusted as indicated in
Attachment A in order to comply with the new Federal Transit Administration
regulations regarding the provision of charter services.
