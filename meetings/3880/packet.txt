May 5, 2025
Board Meeting Date:

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to review its position on Senate Bill 25-161 (SB161).
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Davies, Government Relations Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD developed its Board-adopted 2024 Legislative Program to serve as a guiding document for staff to
pursue goals related to legislative and policy matters. A Legislative Program serves as a living document
that can be adjusted throughout a legislative session to provide an avenue for Board-adopted policy
positions to be communicated and pursued by agency staff.
SB161 was introduced on Tuesday, February 11, 2025, and assigned to the Senate Transportation and
Energy Committee. The full text of the bill, as amended, is appended as Attachment A. During the
monthly Board meeting on February 25, 2025, the Board of Directors voted to take an amend position
on SB161 that sought to make four amendments to the bill. The Board reaffirmed its amend position on
SB161 at the monthly Board meeting on April 29, 2025. Since that time, however, Amendment L.029
substantively amended Sections 3, 4, 5, and 9 of the bill. Amendment L.029 is included as an
attachment to this report. A summary of the Board’s previously requested amendments and the
responsive changes offered by the bill sponsors that were adopted into SB161 are listed below.
Additionally, the changes to the bill which were made on the House floor on May 1st are included in the
updated section-by-section summary contained in the Discussion portion of this report.

•

Section 6 – Requires the transportation commission to develop and publish best practices and
technical assistance materials concerning the creation of regional transportation authorities to
increase funding for transit and to provide additional transit services within the state

•

Sections 7 – Adds language to the powers, duties, functions, rights, and privileges of the Board

•

Section 8 – Prohibits write-in candidates for the Board of Directors

•

Section 9 – Within the Colorado Energy Office, creates an accountability committee, comprised
of appointed members external to the agency along with one ex officio member of the Board of
Directors, one voting member from the Board of Directors, and one voting member who was a
former member of the Board of Directors to evaluate and make recommendations with regards to
RTD governance, compensation, representation of local jurisdictions and state agencies, and
employee retention. The focus of the accountability committee includes the following: Board
Governance, director compensation, paratransit services, expansion of transit service and
employment structure, local government and state agency representation, and workforce
retention. Requires a report on findings and recommendations be submitted to the General
Assembly and Governor by January 30, 2026

•

Section 10 - Makes changes to the reporting requirements that RTD must adhere to with regards
to receiving Clean Transit Enterprise grant funding and exempting RTD from those requirements
for state fiscal year 2026

•

Section 11 – Appropriation of $146,720 for use by the Colorado Energy Office to conduct the
accountability committee

Given that the legislative session is coming to a close, there will be limited opportunity for the Board to
adjust its position on SB161. The Board is asked to consider whether it wishes to adjust its current
position of amend.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
As introduced, SB161 requires RTD to produce a 10-year strategic plan, a comprehensive operational
analysis beyond the scope of current staff planning, update service standards, and create new public
information dashboards beyond current requirements in state law. Staff has not determined which, if
any, of these tasks can be completed utilizing existing staff resources and funding authorization. Funding
sources to complete these requirements have not been identified and will need to be addressed on a
case-by-case scenario; the 2025 Budget and external grant opportunities are potential funding sources
for one or more of these requirements.
