#### 1. Award of Access-a-Ride Call Center Services

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into a contract for the provision of Access-a-Ride Call Center services with First Transit, Inc. This contract is for three years, with two one-year options for a total 5-year amount not to exceed $11,074,125. This proposal represents the most responsive and responsible proposal received in response to Request for Proposals (RFP) 13-DH-026, to provide “Access-a-Ride Call Center” Services. The contract to provide this service is scheduled to be effective October 1, 2013.

Motion:              Director Rivera-Malpiede made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the August 20, 2013 Board meeting.

Director James seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Bruce Abel stated that as was mentioned in the packet, the Access-a-Ride program currently involves several contracted entities.  He said that this action is to re-procure the services of the call center.  Bruce Abel explained that we issued a Request for Proposal in the spring outlining the services the call center provides.  He said that we received 4 proposals that were evaluated by the evaluation committee.  The recommendation is to award the contract to First Transit, the incumbent contractor.

Director Folska asked who was responsible for doing the customer service training for First Transit.  Larry Buter explained that the process is for First Transit to hire a training manager that is responsible for all training activities.  Each employee undergoes core training that is one week in the classroom and one week behind the computer.  He said that RTD monitors the classroom activities and listens to calls to ensure they are adhering to policy and providing excellent customer service.

Director Solano asked what prompted us to look for a new call center.  He wondered if the current call center was not performing as well as we would like.  Bruce Abel said that the expiration of our existing contract is the reason we are looking for a new contractor; it did not have anything to do with performance.  He explained that we do monitor hold times, transaction times and a variety of other call center functions on an ongoing basis.

Committee Chair Tobiassen noted that since Access-a-Ride serves the disabled community it would be in everyone’s interest to encourage First Transit to hire people with disabilities.  He believes this is a great opportunity to help the disabled community and get them involved in RTD and Access-a-Ride.  Bruce Abel stated that First Transit has historically employed people with disabilities and that is something RTD encourages on an ongoing basis.

Larry Buter introduced Marcellinus Andrew, call center manager.

Committee Char Tobiassen declared the motion PASSED to the Unanimous Consent Agenda.

#### 2. Award Contract to Supply 52 – 60’ Low-Floor Articulated Buses

It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to award a contract to New Flyer of America Inc. for the purchase of 52 – 60’ low-floor articulated buses and associated spare components in the amount not to exceed $34,636,614, with an option to purchase up to 140 additional articulated buses over a five year period.

Motion:               Director Folska made the motion to move this item to the Full board at the August 20, 2013 Board meeting.

Director Rivera-Malpiede seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Dean Shaklee stated that this recommendation is to go out to purchase 52 articulated buses from New Flyer of America.  These will replace the 9100 Series NABI articulated buses that are 13 years old.  He explained that they have exceeded the FTA useful life of 12 years and have on average 380K miles.  Dean Shaklee said that we are also experiencing an excessive amount of rust and coercion on the structure of the buses.

Bruce Abel said that we did issue a Request for Proposal in multiple configurations to get pricing varying technologies including clean diesel, compressed natural gas (CNG), hybrid and electric.  He said that staff wanted factual information to engage in lifecycle costing for the various propulsion systems that are in the market today.  He stated that based on the evaluation committee’s scoring, staff is recommending an award to New Flyer for clean diesel.

Director Hoy commented that we have the NABI buses now and New Flyer is the recommended choice this time.  He noted that the pricing for these two companies was very similar so he wondered if there was some other factors that made New Flyer the recommendation.  Dean Shaklee explained that the evaluation committee reviews 4 areas; New Flyer had a score of 88 out of 100 while NAVI had a 77.  He said an important factor in consideration was delivery schedule since this purchase includes the buses for the Downtown Denver Circulator.

Director Daly thanked staff for a very good technical explanation on the fuel system we will be using.  He said many people are recommending CNG or electric but the explanation of why we are going with clean diesel is excellent.  He asked who the parent company of New Flyer is.  Dean Shaklee stated that New Flyer is actually the largest bus manufacturer in the United States.  They started in Canada and moved into Minnesota.

Director Lubow thanked staff for the comparison with the different technology options; however, she said it seems like the cleaner technologies cost more.  She wonders when clean air trumps economics.  Dean Shaklee said that the clean diesel and CNG emissions are almost equal; however the infrastructure needed for CNG would be very expensive.  Bruce Abel explained that staff is always engaged in balancing between cost and benefits.  He said that we do have a fleet of 9 hybrid buses so we could evaluate the technology.  He explained that despite the improvement in the miles per gallon the cost delta was a 20 to 30 year break even for no meaningful improvement in the air pollution.  Bruce Abel stated that staff does see the industry moving toward electric and that will probably be the technology that replaces these buses when the time comes.

Director Solano asked if these buses would be able to burn bio-diesel.  Dean Shaklee stated that the engines are certified for bio-diesels.

Director Daly asked for an explanation of the effect of the altitude on CNG engines.  Dean Shaklee explained that the engines run hotter so they will not last as long and they also have less power.  Additionally, the quality of gas in Denver is not the same as it is at sea level.

Committee Chair Tobiassen asked for the advantages and disadvantages of going with low floor buses.  Bruce Abel explained that the advantage is ease of boarding while the disadvantage is that we do lose 4 seats.  Dead Shaklee stated that the buses also have a wheelchair ramp instead of a lift.  He believes these are superior buses for the passengers.  Director Tobiassen asked if there were any stop modification that needed to be done because of the ramp.  Dean Shaklee stated that there are no necessary changes.

Committee Chair Tobiassen asked if these buses will have the new CAD/AVL system.  Dean Shaklee stated that they will have all the bells and whistles; the buses come pre-wired for CAD/AVL.  He said that we will install the fare box, Smart Card, etc.

Committee Chair Tobiassen declared the motion PASSED.

#### 3. Award Contract to Supply 103 Cutaway Buses for access-a-Ride Service

It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to award a contract to Supreme Bus for the purchase of up to 103 new cutaway buses for the access-a-Ride service in the amount not to exceed $5,228,589, with an option to purchase up to 350 additional cutaway buses over a five year period.

Motion:               Director Rivera-Malpiede made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the August 20, 2013 Board meeting.

Director Daly seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Bruce Abel explained that this action is to move forward with the replacement of our access-a-Ride vehicles due to the fact that they have reached or exceeded the end of their useful life.  He said that we extended an Invitation for Bid (IFB) on June 4, 2013 and four companies submitted bids.  Bruce Abel explained that in an IFB if the companies meet our specifications we go with the low bid.  He stated that initially we purchased 12 smaller vehicles in an attempt to improve our gas mileage and determine if the fleet measured up to all the sales promises.  Bruce Abel said that we did not have a positive experience so we are not moving forward with the option to purchase those additional vehicles.  This re-procurement is an effort to better match our service needs.

Director Lubow asked why these buses have a useful life of 5 years but our larger buses are 12-13 years.  Dean Shaklee explained that these vehicles are built on Fort E-350 chassis and are not designed to last as long.

Director Hoy asked if what we are buying is what he currently sees on the road.  Dean Shaklee said that is correct.

Director Folska asked why we are not purchasing electric or hybrid vehicles in this case.  She believes there is a company in Colorado that manufactures them.  Dean Shaklee stated he is not aware of Ford making a hybrid E-350.  Bruce Abel explained that there is a manufacturer making vehicles with alternative power sources but they have been in and out of business for the last several years; staff does not have confidence that they will be a long term viable option.

Director Rivera-Malpiede said that she really appreciates the information about DBE participation and that it did require an FTA certificate.

Director Deadwyler expressed concern over the securement system in the vehicles.  She noted that many people are moving to scooters rather than wheelchairs and she has heard there is a problem securing the scooters in our current vehicles.  Bruce Abel said the IFB was specified with the most current securement system on the market.  Lou Ha confirmed that these new vehicles will have the capability to secure scooters as well.

Director Solano asked if we have considered if it is more cost effective to lease these types of fleets given that the service life is shorter.  Bruce Abel said that staff has done some cost analysis to determine if it made sense to buy vehicles with longer life but there was not a benefit; he said he is not aware of any analysis done of the benefits of buying versus leasing.  Director Solano believes this is something we should consider.

Director Folska asked whether we were purchasing the vehicles, who will actually be driving them.  She wonders if we lease the vehicles to our access-a-Ride providers.  Director Folska also requested figures for what we pay each provider to operate the vehicles.  Bruce Abel stated that we supply the vehicles to our access-a-Ride service providers as part of our management contract with them.  General Manager Washington said the cost varies by provider but staff would get the numbers.

Director Menten wonders if we have ever considered purchasing F-350s.  She asked if we run into issues with snow or burning up transmissions because the E-350 is two-wheel drive.  Dean Shaklee stated that we do not have issues with the E-350s.

Committee Chair Tobiassen asked if the vehicles are wired for CAD/AVL.  He also stated that he is very impressed with the $50K price tag.  Bruce Abel explained that we have a different system on the Paratransit side but they will have that system.

#### 1. Access-a-Ride Driver Training Review

Larry Buter said that he will be covering two items, the audit of our Paratransit operator training and Access-a-Cab service.

Larry Buter stated that information regarding the audit was included in the August 13, 2013 Operation and Customer Service Committee Agenda Packet.  He explained that training consists of core training and PASS (Passenger Assistance Training) training.  He informed the Board that during the audit it was confirmed that each contractor is training the operators to proficiency.  He shared that is was recommended that RTD evaluate the pros and cons of 1) contracting out the PASS portion of the training to one entity or 2) bringing the PASS portion of training in house to RTD.  Larry Buter said that as soon as the results were shared with the contractors they did take immediate steps to improve any areas identified.

Director Folska stressed that the work staff is doing is outstanding.  She believes that while there is always room for improvement she has been really impressed with the dedication of the RTD staff.  She noted that there are really two parts to training; there is the training for our operators, call center representatives, etc. and then there is the training for our customers.  She thinks if our goal is to move people from Paratransit to fixed routes we need to get the customers more involved in transit travel training.  Director Folska recognizes that we have hired Via Mobility to do that but we need to do a better job of disseminating the information.  Larry Buter stated that Via now employs someone that spends 20 hours per week at Easter Seals to invite Access-a-Ride applicants to sit with them and learn about the travel training program.  He said that you would be amazed at how many people refuse the offer.  He stated that we are trying to reach out to the public by phone and mail; additionally, Via is working on a video of success stories that organizations can use.  Director Folska believes our efforts thus far are completely inadequate.  Bruce Abel said that any suggestions to improve our outreach efforts would be appreciated.

Director Lubow expressed concern because there seemed to be one provider that had fairly serious weaknesses identified in the audit, such as two students falling asleep during training and the trainer being not a good communicator.  Bruce Abel said that what staff was trying to communicate to the Board was that all programs were successful but to varying degrees.  He said it was identified that much of the success of the training was based on the success of the teacher.  That is why there was a recommendation to have a central location so there are not varying degrees of teacher competency.  He said the course of action that was deemed most appropriate is that RTD will increase our monitoring efforts.

Director Menten asked for the cost of the audit and if it was complete.  Larry Buter said that the cost was $13,000; KFH had two individuals that sat through each carriers training.

Director Deadwyler asked what type of training is required for drivers on RTD’s policies and procedures, specifically when it comes to free ride passes.  She said she has had a number of complaints when the drivers have refused the passes even when it is clearly written on the ticket that they are valid for Access-a-Ride service.  Larry Buter stated that operators are trained in all passes that are accepted.  He said that this does come up periodically and when that happens he works with the contractors to notify all operators.  Larry Buter also stated that every operator has on their person a driver alert book that has a section on the passes that are accepted; each driver can also contact dispatch if they are unsure.

Committee Chair Tobiassen said that he would like to commend the Access-a-Ride staff.  He shared that when he first got on the Board, the Access-a-Ride complaints were very high.  He believes that staff has really turned it around; he hardly ever gets complaints and the few he receives are responded to very quickly.

Access-a-Cab Update

Larry Buter said that several Directors expressed concerns about the phone calls they were receiving from constituents that indicated the cab simply just did not show up.  He stated that staff is trying to mitigate these issues; whenever they are made aware of a cab not showing up they take immediate steps to contact the cab company to find out what went wrong.  Larry Buter informed the Board that the cab companies are not mandated to provide accessible transportation; there are some accessible vehicles but when a sufficient number of people call it becomes difficult to schedule.  Larry Buter explained that starting September 1st, people with electronic wheelchairs will be able to schedule their trip up to 24 hours in advance.  He said this does require manual intervention so they want to start with a small group.  Once the process is smooth and effortless it will be opened up to everyone.  Larry Buter stated that this will not completely eliminate the problem but it will definitely improve the service.

Director Deadwyler thanked Larry Buter for the update.  She is one of those individuals that experiences the no shows or lateness of a cab after you have called the company 10 times.  She has been told that the private contractors that operate the accessible vehicles have a choice of whether or not to pick up a passenger with a wheelchair.

Director Folska believes that Access-a-Cab is a way to help people use fixed routes and addresses the last mile program.  If people have something they can count on then it encourages them to have a reliable job.  She thinks staff is being innovative and cutting edge and really appreciates that.

##### a. Assessment of RTD Paratransit Safety Training -KFH - Final

#### 2. Radio and Computer Aided Dispatch and Automatic Vehicle Location (CAD/AVL) Project Status Update

Eric Farrington stated that he included more detail in the report that is available in the August 13, 2013 Operations and Customer Service Committee Agenda Packet based on questions from last month.  He said that installations will be complete on all fixed route in service buses this week and next week installation will be complete on buses that are out-of-service for repairs.

Director Deadwyler noted that there was a yellow dot in the report.  She wants to make sure it is working properly since Eric Farrington informed the Board at the last meeting that we needed to bring someone in to work on the system.  Eric Farrington stated that the yellow dot is in the report because staff is not where they expected to be as it relates to testing; however, the system itself is working quite well.

#### 3. Smart Card Project Status Update

Judy McMurphy introduced Raja Viswanathan.  He is the new project manager from Xerox.  Judy McMurphy stated that he has been a huge asset to the team and RTD is very lucky to have him.

Judy McMurphy stated that staff continues to work with the colleges to get the appropriate cards activated, deactivated, suspended, etc. based on the status of the student.  She said that staff is also making sure the colleges understand their responsibility in managing the cards.  She recognizes that this will be an ongoing training.

Judy McMurphy said that staff has just completed training with the handheld smart media readers.  She explained that her team is working with the marketing department and fare inspectors to begin a campaign in educating our general public about tapping procedures, etc. so they understand the expectations.

Judy McMurphy informed the Board that Xerox is working with us to replace the stanchions on the buses.  This is what holds the card readers.

Judy McMurphy explained that there was a glitch in the Retail Point of Sales (RPOS) testing due to a delay in delivery of the software.  She stated that the time originally planned for testing was used to do a demonstration of the device.  Judy McMurphy said she got some great feedback and questions that will be incorporated into future training.

Director Daly asked why the stanchions needed to be replaced.  Judy McMurphy said that the way the weld was completed originally had single welds at three different points on the base; it was determined that if the weld was completed all the way around it will stand up to vibrations and use better.

Director Menten noted that the report mentioned an SMT meeting with the Denver Mayor’s Office and the City and County of Denver.  She expressed concern in working with these organizations to use one card for rec centers, libraries, etc. while we have our own bugs to work out.  General Manager Washington explained that this is an initiative coming out of the Mayor’s Office to provide transportation to children at the City’s expense.  He stated that staff see this as part of the grow ridership objective that came out of the Board Retreat.  General Manager Washington stated that this has been placed on hold but staff will come back to the Board with more information as things develop.

Director Hoy stated that he has been on a handful of buses where the readers were not working.  He is wondering if that is a multitude of issues or just one issue.  Beverly Scott said that there has been a slight uptick in readers not working over the last week.  She stated that the issue is the same whether the reader is on a bus or platform.  She explained that this is a single issue that staff is well aware of and is working to fix.

Bruce Abel stated that as his team has informed the Board since standing up Phase I in January there have been challenges.  He explained that the outcome of the tests that are part of Phase I will determine the timeline going forward and some of those test have not yet taken place.  Bruce Abel stated that staff wants to get all Phase I issues addressed before moving to Phase II; additionally, the renewal of the EcoPass programs with begin in the Q4.  He explained that because of these factors they have re-timelined Phase II to Q3/Q4 of 2014.

Director Deadwyler asked how far behind schedule we are for Phase I.  Bruce Abel stated that Phase I was stood up on schedule with the implementation of the EcoPasses, CollegePasses, etc. in January.

#### 4. Update on 6 Hour Special Events Pass - No Back Up

Bruce Abel said that as the Board may recall in June 2012 staff brought some policy changes to the Board relative to the Smart Card Program, one of which was changing the day pass to a 6 hour pass.  This change was implemented with the opening of the West corridor.  He shared that in speaking with customers, the Broncos, Rockies, etc. we have learned that this is not an adequate timeline.  He stated that staff is going to move forward with changing it from a 6 hour pass to a 12 hour pass.

Director Folska asked if the Fare Task Force was up and running.  Bruce Abel said that the members have been identified and are getting ready for the first meeting.  He shared that staff did hold a meeting with the people from Boulder and Boulder County.

Director Lasater thanked staff for listening to the customers.  He shared that he has received quite a few comments that the 6 hour timeframe just does not work.  He feels they should have no problem with 12 hours.

### D. Other Matters

Chief Tarbert explained that the CERT program has training that occurs every month and this month covers the advanced classes.  This allows CERT graduates to come back and get further training.  He shared that there is a FEMA course to train a citizen how they can respond to an active shooter situation on August 31st and 8:00 a.m.  He said the Board was welcome to attend.  Committee Chair Tobiassen thanked Chief Tarbert for his work.

Director Hoy shared that he has spent the last several days at Park-n-Rides with 36 Commuting Solutions.  He stated that it seems there are a much greater number of happy customers.  He believes this is due to getting the schedules fixed.  He thinks that we need to consider how we can get people onto the buses that do not use them now.  Director Hoy said there was a woman who had to give her car to her mother when she came into town to watch her children over the summer; she told him that she felt like she was being forced to take the bus but after riding it she will never go back to driving.  Director Hoy believes if we can just get people to try the bus they will like it.

Austin Jenkins reminded the Board that the Light Rail Rodeo will be at the Elati facility this weekend.

Director Deadwyler thanked the Board staff for the new system.  She thinks it is fantastic.

General Manager Washington informed the Board that late last week we were contacted by the U.S. Department of State and asked to host a very high level Ethiopian delegation.  They would like to visit RTD to look at our light rail facilities and best practices as they build out the first sub-Saharan light rail.  General Manager Washington stated that this is a very technical group of engineers and trainers that will be meeting with Capital Program and Light Rail Operations.  The visit will be on August 20th and he will brief the Board on the outcome.

### F. Adjourn

Committee Chair Tobiassen adjourned the meeting at 7:34 p.m. to the Financial Administration and Audit Committee.
