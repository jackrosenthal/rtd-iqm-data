BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Salaried Trustee Appointments

November 14, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
November 28, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve Resolution No. ______, Series of 2023, reappointing Charlene
Polege, Chief People Officer, and Bill Sirois, Senior Manager, Transit Oriented Communities, as Trustees
with terms expiring December 31, 2025, and appointing Jennie Waski, Senior Specialist, Benefits with a
term expiring December 31, 2024, to the Salaried Employee Defined Benefit Pension Plan (DB plan) and
Salaried Employee Defined Contribution Retirement Plan (DC plan) Trusts.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
On January 8, 2008, the Board of Directors adopted Resolution No. 001, Series of 2008 (Resolution No.
1), which established a committee composed of the Board Chair, the Chair of the Salaried Employee
Pension Trust Fund, and the Finance Chair (i.e., the Chair of the Finance Administration and Audit
Committee as it existed at that time) to screen applications from prospective pension and DC plan
Trustees from among “the middle management salaried employee class and the senior management
salaried employee class and…[to] bring recommendations back to the Board.”
As a revision to the process established in Resolution No. 001, the Board adopted Resolution No. 27,
Series of 2010, which stated that, “for reappointment of Trustees who have served satisfactorily and in
whose education the Trusts have made substantial investments, it is not necessary to seek applications
for renewal, and instead the application process established by the Board in 2008 would be used on
those occasions when the Board finds it necessary or appropriate to appoint new salaried Trustees to
the Trusts.”
On May 31, 2016, in Resolution No. 008, Series of 2016 (Resolution No. 008), the Board of Directors
amended the Defined Benefit Pension Trust and the Defined Contribution Retirement Trust (Trusts,
collectively) to remove the “senior” and “middle” management distinction established in Resolution No.
001. Instead, Resolution No. 008 authorized the Board to appoint two employee trustees who
participate in the DB pension plan and two who participate in the DC plan, as well as two Directors
appointed to the Trusts and the Chief Financial Officer, who is a permanent member of the Trusts, to
serve as the same trustees on both trusts.

1.E.1

DISCUSSION
In adopting this recommended action, the agency demonstrates its commitment to meet the Strategic
Priorities of Employee Ownership and Financial Success.
RTD provides a DB pension plan to non-represented (salaried) employees hired before January 1, 2008,
and a DC retirement plan to salaried employees hired thereafter. Each plan is overseen by a Board of
Trustees comprised of four RTD staff, two Board members and the RTD Chief Financial Officer serving
as a permanent trustee. RTD staff trustees are recommended to the Board by the General Manager and
CEO for appointment, and the Board Chair, with full Board approval, appoints two Board members as
trustees.
Trustees serve staggered terms of two years.
The Board’s approval of this recommended action would accomplish the following:
Extend through December 31, 2025, the term of current trustee Charlene Polege, Chief People
Officer, whose term expires on December 31, 2023
Extend through December 31, 2025, the term of current trustee Bill Sirois, whose term expires
December 31, 2023
Appoint Jennie Waski, Senior Specialist, Benefits, to the vacant trustee position with a term
expiring December 31, 2024
The above actions would result in a body of seven trustees, with two active trustees being participants
in the closed DB pension plan.
The term extensions and appointment of these trustees will focus Trust governance with employees
who participate in and represent staff colleagues participating in these retirement plans, have expertise
in the areas of human resources, health and wellness benefits and finance, as well as maintain Board
participation in the salaried employee retirement Trusts in its capacity as a policy-making body.
Further, the Trust plan documents will continue to require Board approval for changes in plan design and
annual budget appropriation in addition to any material changes to the plans coming to the Board
through the Audit Committee.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with the adoption of this recommended action.

MESSAGE FROM THE GENERAL MANAGER AND CEO
November 2023

The FY 2024 Budget represents the agency’s financial
plan for the forthcoming year. In adopting this budget
framework in alignment with the 2021-2026 Strategic
Plan, the agency demonstrates its ongoing
commitment to the Strategic Priorities of Community
Value, Customer Excellence, Employee Ownership, and
Financial Success. With this commitment also comes a
renewed collective focus on three primary initiatives:
Back to Basics, People Power, and Welcoming Transit
Environment.
•

Back to Basics: RTD strives to enhance the
reach and impact of internal
communications and to redouble agency
efforts to maintain assets in a state of good
repair leveraging sound asset management
principles

•

People Power: Recognizing the critical
importance of its people, the agency’s most
important resource, in achieving the
agency’s mission, RTD seeks to vigorously
address impediments to recruitment and
retention efforts and to foster a culture of
learning and development

•

Welcoming Transit Environment: RTD seeks
to reduce the impacts of criminal behaviors
and Code of Conduct violations on agency
services and workplaces and, in doing so, to
improve community and employee
perception of personal and public security
on RTD property and vehicles

Through the efforts of the Finance Team, agency
executives, senior managers, and subject matter
experts, these three initiatives are reflected throughout
the 2024 Proposed Budget and have been interwoven
into work plans created by employees throughout the
agency. By focusing on these important factors, RTD
Regional Transportation District
2024 PROPOSED BUDGET

can continue to strive to achieve
meaningful progress toward
established success outcomes.
In keeping with these success
outcomes, RTD continues to
adapt to accommodate the
ever-evolving transit needs of
customers and communities
throughout the agency’s 2,342
square mile footprint.

Debra A. Johnson

In Q1 2024, RTD will implement large-scale changes to
the agency’s fare structure as contemplated by
recommendations culminating from the Systemwide
Fare Study and Equity Analysis (Study) conducted in
2022 and 2023. When RTD launched the Study in April
2022, it embarked on the most comprehensive and
holistic review of fares the agency had taken in its 50plus year history. In response to customer feedback
regarding the cost and complexity of fares, the Study
was predicated upon the overarching goals of creating
a fare structure that is simpler, more equitable,
more affordable. The fare structure for 2024 and
beyond mirrors those laudable goals.
Under the new, simpler fare structure, not only will full
fare paying customers be asked to pay less for fares
across the board, existing discounts for eligible
individuals will be increased, truly enhancing the
overall affordability and accessibility of public transit
throughout the Denver metro area.
Moreover, the agency is offering all of its transit
services at no cost to those 19 years of age or younger
commencing in September 2023 and continuing
through August 31, 2024; further, the agency is
seeking additional legislative support to continue
offering this program for years to come.
As contemplated in the System Optimization Plan
approved by the Board in 2022, RTD continues to
deploy transit service commensurate with the agency’s

All those within RTD’s established boundaries,
including visitors traveling to the region, have a vested
interest in RTD’s ongoing success. Even those who
have never stepped foot on one of the agency’s
revenue vehicles reap the rewards of a robust, reliable,
accessible transit system by way of benefits that
include cleaner air, lower congestion, and dependable
mobility options should the need arise. In fulfilling the
myriad of needs of customers and communities
throughout the region, RTD is truly fulfilling its mission
of making lives better through connections.
Of course, none of this would be possible without the
efforts of those steadfast employees who work
tirelessly to make transit service delivery possible. I
acknowledge and appreciate the collaborative efforts of
all RTD employees, as well as the efforts of the Board
of Directors and the agency’s union and contractor
partners.

I once again extend my sincere thanks and
appreciation for the contributions in the timely
preparation of the FY 2024 Budget to Doug MacLeod,
Chief Financial Officer; Todd Nikkel, Senior Manager,
Budget; Heidi Wagner, Senior Manager, Finance; the
Budget Analysts, and the members of the Leadership
Team.
And lastly, I would be remiss not to thank the
customers, communities, stakeholders, and partners
who engage with RTD every day.
On behalf of RTD, I truly appreciate the opportunity to
lead this team of dedicated individuals as the agency
strives to be the trusted leader in mobility,

delivering excellence and value to our
customers and community.
Sincerely,

INTRODUCTION
The Regional Transportation District’s 2024 Proposed Budget (Budget) represents the expected revenues,
expenditures and financial position anticipated for the fiscal year January 1 through December 31, 2024. The RTD
Board of Directors appropriates funding by fiscal year that allows the agency to continue its mission to make lives
better through connections. The expenditures set forth herein align the Budget with RTD’s Strategic Plan Priorities
and prioritized objectives within the projected financial constraints.

For FY2024, the operating expense budget is $1,040.8M, new capital is $185.5M, debt service is $223.3M, capital
carryforward of $232.8M for a total expenditure budget of $1,682.4M. Fund balances are budgeted at $898.6M.

This Budget demonstrates RTD’s financial capacity to address, based on current information, the agency’s strategic
priorities in the near term. The development of the Budget is a cross-departmental collaborative effort; hence the
proposed budget for the Board’s consideration is a collective staff recommendation.

1.E.2.c

The 2024 Proposed Budget focuses on the Strategic
Priorities of the Board-approved 2021-2026 Strategic
Plan. As a result, funding appropriations are aligned in
a manner to direct efforts towards achieving the
desired success outcomes as measured by specific
metrics.
The 2024 Proposed Budget operating expenses have
been developed in accordance with the System
Optimization Plan (SOP) approved by the Board. Other
significant expenditures for debt service and capital
expenditures are also included in this proposed budget
which have been developed utilizing RTD’s debt
service schedules, capital needs identified through the
Transit Asset Management (TAM) Plan as well as
capital projects previously approved by the Board for
appropriation that have not been fully completed
(capital carryforward). The TAM Plan continues to be
evaluated, adjusted, and prioritized to address the
agency’s needs to maintain assets in a state of good
repair.
While RTD’s current financial position is strong and
funding capacity is available to fund initiatives and
programs within the Strategic Priorities and Initiatives,
it is expected that the agency will continue to be
challenged with accessing adequate non-financial
resources as a result of the difficult labor market
environment, supply chain issues and high inflation.
Economic conditions indicate that retail spending is
slowing and decreasing due to higher personal debt
levels, inflation and discontinuance of federal
government transfer payments that occurred for
Regional Transportation District
2024 PROPOSED BUDGET

economic incentives during the COVID-19 emergency.
Furthermore, the RTD 0.6% sales tax will be subject to
Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TABOR) revenue growth
limitations beginning in 2025. While economic
conditions in the Denver metro area remain better than
national averages as a result of low unemployment,
strong personal income growth and a diverse business
base, the agency is heavily reliant on sales and use
taxes, which can be adversely affected by changes in
personal spending behaviors.
Although challenging circumstances exist in the
economy, the agency expects to continue to benefit
from favorable short-term investment rates and low
long-term interest rates for borrowing. Historical
experience during economic slowdowns have also
contributed to more favorable labor market conditions
to improve hiring and retention. Finally, the agency is
well positioned with strong reserves to weather
negative impacts to sales and use taxes.
This Budget proposal sets a financial course that is
prudent and strategic while providing the foundation
for financial sustainability.
The agency will continue to uphold its responsibility of
good stewardship of taxpayer dollars while striving to
provide Community Value, Customer Excellence,
Employee Ownership, and Financial Success. The 2024
Proposed Budget seeks to align expenditures with the
Strategic Priorities and Initiatives while maintaining a
conservative approach to revenue assumptions.

STRATEGIC PLAN ALIGNMENT
The Budget has been developed to direct resources to RTD’s Strategic Plan Priorities.

RTD strives to be a strong community
partner, providing value to customers as well
as to the broader Denver metro region while
sustaining planet Earth

Employee Ownership

Customer Excellence

Financial Success

RTD strives to consistently deliver highquality customer service

RTD takes very seriously the management of all
financial resources

RTD seeks to attract and retain a highly skilled
and engaged workforce

The Budget has been further refined to focus on the agency’s three Strategic Initiatives. The three initiatives
outlined below drive RTD’s operational decision-making and will support resource utilization in 2024.

Back to Basics
RTD is redoubling its efforts to maintain assets in a state of good repair,
leveraging sound asset management principles. Additionally, this strategic
initiative focuses on enhancing the reach and impact of the agency’s
internal communications efforts. Ensuring all employees have the
information needed to be successful in their role is critically important to
maintaining an engaged workforce.
In support of Back to Basics in 2024, RTD will focus on replacing large sections of the downtown rail in Denver. This 30year-old section of the track opened for service in 1994 and needs a full-depth replacement. Replacing the downtown rail
will ensure that RTD is able to maintain its assets for the next 30 years and beyond. Additional plans are being developed
for replacement of other sections of RTD’s light rail track.
Additionally, RTD staff is implementing a more robust strategic approach in implementing and maintaining an effective
Transit Asset Management (TAM) plan in which prioritization of asset replacements and renewals are prioritized according
to the Strategic Initiatives. Staff completed a review and prioritization of capital carryforward projects resulting in a
significant decrease to those efforts to align with available resources.

People Power
RTD’s employees are the agency’s most important resource. In order to
achieve RTD’s mission of making lives better through connections, the
agency is vigorously addressing impediments to employee recruitment and
retention. Additionally, the agency is focused on creating a culture of
learning and development.

Community Value

1.E.2.c
In support of People Power in 2024, RTD has prioritized resources to focus on recruitment and retention of frontline
workers in addition to hiring of police officers.
Several efforts are underway for employee training and recognition programs as well.

Welcoming Transit Environment

In support of Welcoming Transit Environment in 2024, RTD will focus on
continuing to build the RTD Police Department and place less reliance on
contracted security services. Additional efforts will also be undertaken for crime prevention through environmental design.

FISCAL AND BUDGETARY POLICIES
Annually, the Board considers the RTD Fiscal Policy for the following fiscal year. Development of the Budget adheres
to this Fiscal Policy. The Board approved the 2024 Fiscal Policy the October 24, 2023, Board meeting. The 2024
Budget Policy, which is derived from the 2024 Fiscal Policy, is summarized as follows:

RTD seeks to reduce the impacts of criminal behaviors and Customer Code of
Conduct violations on its services and in workplaces. This strategic initiative
prioritizes the safety and security of customers and employees on RTD’s
vehicles and property.

1.E.2.c

FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
The financial aspects of a budget consist of three primary categories: revenues, expenditures, and reserves (also
referred to as fund balances). Revenues and expenditures provide the cash inflows and outflows while reserves
provide the financial balance to smooth cash flow volatility and supply the financial relief necessary for unforeseen
circumstances that inevitably arise.

Revenue sources are generally either recurring or finite. RTD’s Fiscal Policy establishes that one-time revenues be
used for one-time expenditures while recurring revenues provide a sustainable source to fund ongoing needs.
Because one-time revenues have a finite term, commitments for recurring expenditures require an alternative
source once the one-time revenues are exhausted.
RTD’s sources of recurring revenue, in descending order of size, are sales and use taxes, fares, federal operating
grants and miscellaneous revenue from advertising, investment income and rent. Historically, RTD has also been
the recipient of one-time revenues from federal capital grants, federal COVID-19 relief funding, local contributions,
and land sales. RTD does not budget or forecast one-time revenues unless certainty exists.
Revenue assumptions for the Budget include the following:
•

Fare revenue has been adjusted downward to $63.9M in anticipation of impacts from implementing
initiatives culminating from the Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis. These impacts are expected to
result in the fare recovery ratio (fare revenue vs. operating expenses) to only be approximately 5%. The
decrease in fare rates, simplification of fares, zero fares for youth and increase of the LiVE Program
discounts are the primary factors related to decreased fares. However, the overall financial impact to the
agency is relatively small, with fares having previously decreased as a percentage of total revenues during
the COVID-19 pandemic.

•

Sales and use tax projections were provided by the University of Colorado Leeds School of Business (CU
Leeds) in August 2023. The CU Leeds forecast model predicts that tax collections will be lower in 2024 by a
modest amount compared to the March 2023 forecast. The lower forecast for 2024 resulted from a
slowdown in year-over-year growth in actual tax collections during 2023. Significant tax growth in the
preceding three years combined with federal COVID-19 grant relief funding has resulted in strong growth in
reserves and significantly higher investment returns. The RTD forecast aligns with the statewide
expectations from the Colorado Legislative Council (CLC) and Office of State Budgeting and Planning
(OSPB).

•

Operating grants of $154.2M are anticipated in 2024. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) increased the
annual FTA preventive maintenance formula grants to RTD by approximately 30%. Additionally, the federal
COVID-19 relief grants, which were fully drawn in May 2023, resulted in a delay in drawing preventive
maintenance grant funding due to additional expenditures needed. Therefore, the agency intends to
accelerate drawing of these apportionments in the coming fiscal year. The grant apportionments are based
upon financial and statistical data that RTD submits to the National Transit Database (NTD).

•

Capital grants of $156.4M are expected in 2024. The majority of these funds are pass-through grants
related to Colfax BRT.

Revenues

1.E.2.c

COVID-19 relief grants were fully drawn in 2023. This additional grant funding combined with strong sales
and use taxes has contributed to an unprecedented balance of over $1 billion in cash and investments as
well as substantial reserves, which, along with higher interest rates, will generate additional investment
income in 2024. These significant cash and investment balances are earmarked for state of good repair
needs and maintaining fund balances in accordance with the RTD Fiscal Policy.

•

Other revenue includes recurring revenue of $38.4M which consists primarily of a federal Build America
Bonds (BAB) interest rate subsidy and advertising revenues.

Expenditures
Expenditures consist of both recurring expenses, such as operating expenses, as well as occasional outlays such as
projects, debt service and capital expenditures.
RTD’s largest expenditures are providing transit-related operations. These costs include compensation, materials
and supplies, contracted services, insurance, utilities, and other such expenses.

RTD has ongoing asset management needs that are informed by the TAM Plan and requests for new
initiatives. Asset management needs can fluctuate significantly by year when, for example, a single year
includes a large purchase such as fleet replacements. There are no significant fleet replacements contemplated
in 2024, however, design and pricing are being developed for certain rail component renewals and
replacements as some portions of track are reaching the 30-year mark. Appropriation for repair and
replacement activities for light rail track is requested at $150.0M. These activities are contemplated for 2024
including shutdowns of certain significant portions of rail lines in the downtown Denver area. Staff intends to
continue to fund capital needs with cash on hand in the Capital Replacement Reserve. However, analyses will
continue to be performed to ensure that the most financially advantageous asset management funding
mechanisms are pursued, given that investment return rates currently exceed borrowing rates.
Operating expenses include an average of 5.1% increases due to inflationary pressures and supply chain
constraints remain a concern, particularly with certain materials. RTD has taken steps to accelerate certain
large purchases and also to allow for additional lead times in order to lock-in prices.
Expenditure assumptions for the Budget include:
•

Salaries and wages assume full staffing to provide service levels in accordance with the System
Optimization Plan (SOP). While it is anticipated that continued high employment and a competitive job
market will prolong RTD’s ability to attract and maintain full staffing levels, funding has been made
available in these appropriations. In addition, the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) includes wage
increases that have been included with provisions for incentive pay for represented employees until
such time that adequate staffing levels are achieved. The compensation increases in 2024 shown below
are primarily driven by annual increases and the addition of sworn RTD police officers, which the latter
increase is partially offset by the decrease in contracted security services included in Outside Services

•

Benefits include the following:
o

A 2% increase for represented employee health and welfare benefit premiums. Larger prior
year premium increases resulting from many large claims, particularly those from claimants with
COVID-19 related complications, have subsided

Regional Transportation District
2024 PROPOSED BUDGET

13

Packet Pg. 40

Attachment: Proposed Budget (2024)[11-08-23] (4856 : 2024 Proposed Budget)

RTD also has a significant debt burden primarily from capital expansion projects as well as obligations issued to
finance the purchase of rolling stock. RTD completed two refinancings in 2023 to realize interest savings and reduce
the debt burden. As interest rates have risen recently, RTD does not anticipate performing additional refinancings in
2024.

•

o

A 10% increase for non-represented employee health benefits in 2024. In 2023, RTD improved
the pricing of the CIGNA plan to provide an affordable alternative to the Kaiser Permanente
plan as an enhancement to employee satisfaction. Shifts in participation between these two
plans occurred, which necessitated the 2024 increases

o

Dental and vision plans for employees remain largely unchanged for 2024, with certain
guaranteed pricing having been completed in 2023

o

Retirement plans for represented employees in 2024 include the same 2023 RTD contribution,
of 15% of wages to the defined benefit pension plan employee contributions remaining at 5%
per the CBA. This plan was closed to new entrants on January 1, 2023. In addition, provisions
have been included to fund the new defined contribution plan at 9% with up to a 5% match for
new employees having commenced January 1, 2023. The defined benefit pension plan is 76%
funded. As the number of active employees in the defined benefit pension plan continues to
decline due to retirements, future years may require a shift from a percentage of active wages
to a fixed annual amount based on actuarial recommended contributions in order to maintain an
adequate funding level

o

The non-represented employee defined benefit pension plan is funded with a $15.0M
contribution in 2024, which is the same amount contributed in 2023. The actuarially
recommended contribution in 2024 is $11.0M, and the additional $4.0M is recommended by the
Trustees due to the availability of cash and the notion that funds contributed to this plan earn a
higher rate of return that RTD can achieve under the restrictions of the Investment Policy. The
additional contributions in 2024 reduce the long-term financial risk to RTD of future inadequate
funding. This plan is 79% funded and currently has 140 active participants. This plan has been
closed to new employees since January 1, 2008, and funding requirements will tail off over the
next several years

o

The non-represented employee defined contribution plan assumes RTD funding of 9% of
wages, which is the same amount contributed in 2022. Board policy is to contribute 7-9% of
wages each year. Only non-represented employees hired January 1, 2008, and thereafter
participate in this retirement plan. In October 2023, a recommendation to the Board was made
to change the five-year cliff vesting to 20% vesting for each full year of employment up to
100% at the end of the fifth year to bring the vesting in this plan into parity with the
represented defined contribution plan

o

RTD will continue to offer the 457(b) retirement plan to all employees. This is a voluntary plan
for which only employee contributions, and no RTD contributions, may be made, up to Internal
Revenue Service annual limits. RTD will continue to fund the administrative costs

Materials and supplies consist of consumable items such as fuel, fluids, and parts. Diesel fuel purchases
are typically contracted at a locked price for a certain number of gallons. RTD is currently assessing a
diesel fuel contract for 2024 but has not yet locked pricing. Contracting fuel purchases provides budget
certainty, particularly in the volatile fuel pricing environment. Diesel and gasoline expenses typically
account for 2% of operating expenses and the increases

•

Services consist of contracted specialty IT and legal needs as well as security. Additionally, these
expenses contain inflationary increases which are offset by reductions resulting in a $32.7M decrease in
2024. The majority of the decrease is due efforts to budget more accurately for execution based on
personnel constraints as well as a reduction in contracted security needs which will be replaced with
RTD police officers. An additional appropriation of $137.9M is included which results from a passthrough grant Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with Denver to provide funding for Cofax bus rapid
transit (BRT) corridor enhancements. There is no net financial impact to RTD due to future receipts of
offsetting grant funding.

•

Insurance costs are expected to increase modestly due to premium increases and certain
enhancements to coverages to manage financial risks to the agency. Insurance costs have been
relatively flat over an extended period due to effective claims management

•

Other expenses primarily contain expenditures for utilities and purchased transportation and, to a
lesser degree, various minor business expenses

•

o

Utilities include projected amounts for traction power commensurate with planned rail service
levels and in alignment with 2023 usage with a slight increase due to current rates

o

Purchased transportation includes contractual increases and are aligned with expected revenue
service hours. The contractual increases in 2024 reflect fixed route bus and ADA contract
amendments as well as a larger service availability payment to the Eagle P3 concessionaire for
single year asset maintenance need contemplated in the Concessionaire Agreement

o

Travel and training and budgets have been maintained at the same levels as 2023 with the
intent to contribute to employee development and industry participation.

o

Funding for an on-call contract is included to address specialty consulting engagements, if
necessary

o

A budget of $250,000 is available for employee engagement to be used for outreach and
recognition programs. All other discretionary spending will continue to be limited

Debt service represents a significant portion of RTD’s annual expenditures. Debt service consists of
principal and interest payments on bonds, certificates of participation (COPs) and lease-purchase
agreements. Debt service payments for 2024 will total $223.3M, down from $225.8M in 2023 as a
result of refinancings for interest savings. The Base System bond payments will expire in 2024, at
which point, the Base System will be subject to TABOR restrictions.

Memorandum
To:

Board of Directors

From:

Debra A. Johnson, General Manager and CEO

Date:

November 14, 2023

Re:

Staff Response to 2024 Proposed Budget Board Inquiries

The 2024 Proposed Budget will be presented as a recommended action item during the Finance and Planning
Committee on Tuesday, November 14, 2023, and, if approved in committee, during the Board Meeting scheduled
to be held on Tuesday, November 28, 2023.
On Friday, November 10, 2023, Board Office Executive Manager Jack Kroll provided to me a compiled list of
questions posed by Directors regarding the 2024 Proposed Budget
This memorandum serves as staff’s response to those questions.
Question1: What is an "MTFP project"?
Response 1: The 2024-2029 Mid-term Financial Plan (MTFP) includes projects in the forecasted
expenditures. Projects may be capital assets that have a life of more than one year and/or may be expense
projects for which there is not a capital asset owned by RTD. Projects are efforts that may contain multiple
components and refer to single or aggregations of multiple capital and expense items. Projects are
captured under a single project number in RTD’s financial systems. An example of an MTFP project is the
downtown Denver loop light rail track replacement, which requires repair and replacement of multiple
assets, such as track, concrete, ballast, etc., as well as expenses for items not owned by RTD, such as
streets and sidewalks, in addition to external engineering and consulting work.
Question 2: Is there a policy on carrying forward expenses? If so, what is it? Or what has been our practice?
Response 2: Yes. Both the Board-approved 2023 Fiscal Policy and the 2024 proposed Fiscal Policy contain
the following provision, in both instances on page 2:

RTD will limit capital expenditure and expense fiscal year carry-forwards to the lesser of the life of the
project or three years.
Question 3: Is there a more detailed budget breakdown by department? Are any of these department expenses
actually capex?

Question 4: Why would we have the New Flyer electric buses in FY23 capital carry-forward? Why did we approve
an electric bus study for FY23, and how does that relate to the conversations on New Flyer?
Response 4: There are no electric buses included in the capital carryforward. RTD is currently replacing
40-foot diesel buses, and deliveries will continue into 2024, thereby necessitating a carry-forward of
appropriated funding. Moreover, the “study” underway is for development of a facilities and fleet transition
plan with a focus on low-no emission vehicles, not solely electric revenue transit vehicles.
Question 5: For accounting methods, do we consider funds awarded when the check comes or when the letter
comes that a check is pending?
Response 5: Staff considers funding to be awarded upon receipt of the notification letter of said award.
Further, staff budgets for apportioned funds as part of the established accounting process. Actual revenue
is recognized when eligible expenses are incurred and submitted to the Federal Transit Administration for
reimbursement.
Question 6: What is the projected cost of any salary increases for non-represented salaried employees?
Response 6: Recognizing the critical importance of the agency’s people power, efforts were made through
the negotiation of the most recent collective bargaining agreement with the Amalgamated Transit Union
Local 1001 and the Compensation for Study for non-represented staff to ensure RTD’s base compensation
is market competitive. This has resulted in hourly wage increases for represented employees of 4%
annually in both 2023 and 2024.
In alignment with these efforts, salary increases for non-represented employees, approximately
commensurate with the increase in the Consumer Price Index for the Denver-Aurora-Lakewood area and
including a corresponding aging of the employees’ pay bands/compensation structure, are currently being
considered by the General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) and Chief People Officer. While a funding provision
has been included in the 2024 Proposed Budget for salary increases, this amount is a placeholder and
does not necessarily represent the final determination. For that reason, specific salary increases will not
be shared publicly at this time.
Question 7: What is the plan for the $45M net cash flow in 2023 as shown on P.21?
Response 7: Net cash flows are retained in fund balances to be used in future periods with Board
appropriation approval. RTD will experience negative cash flows in certain years, such as when large

Response 3: Yes. RTD budgets by department, cost center and object account and records those budgets
within agency financial records. The 2024 Proposed Budget materials provided for the Tuesday, November
14, 2023, Finance and Planning Committee meeting includes a chart depicting the operating expense
breakdown by department. Staff can provide detail income statements by department as necessary.
Capital expenditures are not recorded by department.

1.E.2.g

Subject: Staff Response to 2024 Proposed Budget Board Inquiries
Page: 3
purchases are made, and positive cash flows in other years. The variance in net cash is managed through
reserves to ensure fiscal sustainability.

Response 8: The decrease in Outside Services noted in the draft 2024 Proposed Budget, as presented
during the Finance and Planning Committee meeting on Tuesday, October 3, 2023, is attributable to the
reduction in contracted security services. This reduction is commensurate with an increase in the Transit
Police and Emergency Management Department personnel and equipment, which increase is accounted
for in salaries and benefits and other expenses. The 2024 Proposed Budget allocation for Outside Services
reflects an overall significant increase given the inclusion of an expense for a pass-through grant, which
is offset by grant funding and has no net financial impact to RTD.
Question 9: What is the current state of reserves? Is there a reason this isn't shown in the budget?
Response 9: The 2024 Proposed Budget includes a listing of budgeted reserve or fund balances, as shown
on page 9 of the agenda packet for the Tuesday, November 14, 2023, Finance and Planning Committee
meeting. The total estimated reserves are $898.6 million.
Question 10: Leases and rentals seem to be increasing materially, what is contributing to this change?
Response 10: Leases and rentals are budgeted to increase from $3.3 million in 2023 to $5.2 million in
2024. This category represents less than 1% of the total operating budget; however, the increase is due
to higher lease payments for the Civic Center administrative building in which many staff offices are
located.
Question 11: Have we been able to reduce costs through partnerships and similarly increase services? This is a
core tenet of the strategic plan and it'd be good to see how we're doing from a dollars stand point on these
initiatives.
Response 11: The 2023 Budget included $2 million for the Call for Projects Partnerships Program, whereas
the 2024 Proposed Budget allocates $4 million to the program, both to continue funding commitments for
projects selected in 2023 and for new partnership efforts in 2024. This funding was made available due
to higher-than-anticipated sales and use tax revenue. It is important to note that the 2023 projects were
announced in September 2023, thus full implementation has yet to come to fruition.
Question 12: Are we carrying any reserve dollars for larger capital improvement projects? For example, we are
regularly told at meetings the challenges that having older facilities and facilities outside of our control can create.
In order to make these improvements and avoid debt in an environment like this, it would seem to make sense
that we should be carrying funds to replace things like bus depots at some point.

Question 8: We seem to be creating a strong decrease in outside services and other expenses, what is this
attributed to?

Page: 4

Question 13: On the revenue side, there have been a number of conversations on finding ways to diversify our
revenue. However, it does not appear that we are engaging in this when we evaluate both revenues and
expenditures, recognizing it takes money to make money. Is there a plan to act on revenue diversification? Or is
this something that would require further board action?
Response 13: During the September 12, 2023, Finance and Planning Committee meeting (meeting), staff
presented an update regarding the creation of a Revenue Diversification Working Group (Working Group),
the concept of which originated during the Board’s 2023 retreat. The Working Group, which has held two
meetings to date, was created to investigate revenue diversification and other opportunities to mitigate
financial risk associated with reliance on a limited number of funding sources. A position paper regarding
the purpose, activities, and reporting structure of the Working Group was included in the meeting’s agenda
packet. Finance Committee Vice Chair Erik Davidson serves as the Board liaison to the Working Group.
Moreover, Chair Guissinger has participated in both Working Group meetings. Currently, the Working
Group is in the research phase.
Question 14: What is RTD contributing to the defined benefit pension plan for non-represented salaried
employees? And is this something the Board will vote on separately as used to be the case?
Response 14: The 2024 Proposed Budget includes a $15 million contribution to the non-represented
employee pension plan. This contribution is recommended by the non-represented employee pension trust
in consultation with the trust actuary and is the same amount contributed in 2023. Trustees include
Directors Broom and Dishell. This pension plan was closed to new employees on January 1, 2008.
Approximately 140 active employees and 469 inactive employees and beneficiaries are included in the
plan, and the pension is 79% funded. No separate vote will occur on this item as it is included in the 2024
Proposed Budget that that will be considered by the Board.
Question 15: In general, how is RTD doing with respect to it’s pension plans and the associated obligations: are
we caught up? How solvent are we? Are we doing anything this year to catch up?
Response 15: Both the represented and non-represented employee pension plans are closed to new
employees, which significantly reduces the financial risk to both pension beneficiaries and RTD. The nonrepresented employee pension is 79% funded, and the represented employee pension is 76% funded.
The trustees and staff are comfortable with this level of funding, since the plans are closed and future
contributions will rise in the short-term then trail off over time. The $15 million recommended contribution
includes $4 million intended to mitigate the underfunded portion of pension assets in the non-represented

Response 12: In the 2024 Proposed Budget, $185 million has been allocated to the Capital Replacement
Fund for asset renewals and replacements in accordance with the Transit Asset Management (TAM) plan.
Staff projects that the necessary funding will be available through 2029 to fund the TAM with the Capital
Replacement Fund. The Board may also consider authorizing the use of the Unrestricted Fund should
unforeseen needs arise. The agency also has other options to finance large capital purchases as necessary.

Question 16: What is included in the following expense/cash flow categories on page 21 of the Proposed Budget
a. Insurance
b. Outside services
c. Grant Revenues
d. Purchased services
Response 16: Those expenses are detailed as follows:
Insurance includes the projected expenses for self-insured claims and insurance premiums for excess
coverages for Worker’s Compensation, physical damage, and liability claims.
Outside service includes expenses incurred for utilizing third parties, including building and facility
maintenance, external IT services, contracted security services, software maintenance, Partnership
Program funding, and specialty consulting services such as engineering.
Grant revenues include formula grant funds, which are primarily derived from Federal Transit
Administration preventive maintenance grants, annually apportioned to the agency under 49 U.S.C. 5307
based on information the submitted to the National Transit Database (NTD). RTD only budgets for grants
where certainty exists that funding will be received.
Purchased transportation includes operational services provided by third parties utilizing RTD’s assets,
such as contracted fixed-route bus, paratransit and FlexRide services, in addition to commuter rail
operating service for the A, B and G lines
Question 17: What is the plan for the R Line safety improvements and where is that money coming from?
Response 17: These improvements were funded in the 2023 Budget, and this project is in the design
phase after having completed the conceptual phase. Upon completion of the 30% design, this work will
be competitively bid following a solicitation for proposals. The work is anticipated to be completed in Q1
2026.
Question 18: P. 13 "Because these repair and replacement activities are still being planned for 2024, only relatively
small amounts have been requested for appropriation with the intent of staff to return to the Board with additional
appropriation requests at a later time, once the project scope is completed. Staff intends to continue to fund
capital needs with cash on hand in the Capital Replacement Reserve. I understand that RTD will be budgeting
$150 million to these repair and replacement activities. Have we changed this narrative as well?
Response 18: Staff has included in the 2024 Proposed Budget $150 million to complete the downtown
Denver loop light rail track replacements. This funding will be provided with cash on hand utilizing the

employee pension plan. The CBA guides the contributions to the represented employee pension plan for
which RTD will contribute 15% and the employee will contribute 5% in 2024.

Question 19: Where is the funding for the Partnership Program in the Budget?
Response 19: The 2024 Proposed Budget includes $4 million for the Partnership Program in the Bus
Operations Department in the Outside Services line item.
Question 20: Why hasn't the Board rec'd a status report of capex projects that are in progress/deferred/etc. in
three years? Previously, that would have been part of the MTFP. Did we change board policy?
Response 20: As RTD transitions from a program of large-scale capital expansion with respect to the
FasTracks buildout to a long-term operations and maintenance program as envisioned in the 2021-2026
Strategic Plan, a holistic review of capital projects and resource allocation is occurring as part of the Backto-Basics Strategic Initiative. This effort includes the close-out of older projects and the evaluation and
prioritization of future projects according to project criteria focused on safety, compliance, statutory
requirements and the TAM. This transition represents a significant effort, given that RTD currently has
$9.2 billion in assets. As information regarding this shift in focus is developed and finalized, staff will begin
providing updates to the Board as well as providing publicly available information on the RTD website
regarding current and future planned projects.
Question 21: Will the Board be updated as to what previously appropriated capital expenditures are/will be
abandoned - and the justification?
Response 21: Staff has included in the 2024 Proposed Budget the 2023 capital carryforward and 2024
new capital requests. A listing of closed and completed capital expenditures is not included in the 2024
Proposed Budget, since future capital expenditures will be focused on ongoing and future needs in
alignment with the Strategic Plan and TAM.
Question 22: Will there be a comprehensive update on capital carry-forward?
Response 22: Staff has included in the 2024 Proposed Budget documents the 2023 capital carryforward
list, which catalogues several individual projects that were previously approved for funding appropriation
by the Board. Staff is available to meet separately and discuss in more detail.
Question 23: Would RTD please send the list of all previously approved unexpended or unencumbered capital
project appropriations by EOB? I believe RTD maintains list that contains the description, a full summary/rationale,
a cost center/dept, the FY awarded, a tracking code, and the amount spent against the appropriation. Which
previously approved projects have been abandoned and why?

Capital Replacement reserve. The narrative has not changed. In 1994, RTD commissioned its first light
rail line for revenue service, the central corridor, which extends 5.3 miles from Broadway and I-25 Station
to 30th and Downing Street in Denver. Recognizing the rail was installed prior to the opening, it is now
more than 30 years old, and due to its age and de-icing agents used on the downtown street segment,
the paved section needs replacement.

Response 23: The 2023 capital carryforward included in the 2024 Proposed Budget includes each project
that was previously approved for appropriation by the Board. The dollar amounts listed are the remaining
funding available after any encumbrances and actual expenditures have occurred. The purpose of capital
carryforward is to request approval to carry unspent and unencumbered balances that were previously
appropriated by the Board into the new year because the projects overlap fiscal years.
Thank you.
