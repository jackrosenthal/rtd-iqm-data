BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

Subject:

Approval of ERP Licenses

CFO/AGM,

GM
Board Meeting Date: December 18, 2018

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to award a contract
to Workday for licenses for the ERP Replacement Program – Phase2 (Human Capital Management and
Payroll) for an amount not to exceed $2,700,000 over 5 years. RTD will be utilizing the City and
County of Denver’s contract with Workday. Subscriptions for the ERP Replacement Program – Phase 2
will be paid annually.
General Manager Goals:
 Core Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management
 Task Goal #1 – Fiscal Sustainability
 Task Goal #2 – Workforce and Human Capital
BACKGROUND
The current Oracle e-business suite (EBS) enterprise resource planning (ERP) implementation at RTD is
approaching end of life. Oracle will end support for the EBS system in 2021.
Starting in 2017, the Information Technology team began researching various approaches for the ERP
replacement. Modern ERP solutions are moving toward a cloud-based, specialized solution. Three options
for replacement were presented to the AGM’s for consideration:
Upgrade the existing ERP Oracle system to Oracle Cloud.
1. Implement another vendor’s single cloud ERP solution (such as SAP or Workday)
2. Use a best-of-breed hybrid approach by implementing ERP cloud-based solutions for specific lines
of business (such as finance and human resources)
The options were presented to the AGM’s and they determined to use a best-of-breed, hybrid approach.
This enables RTD to take advantage of the strengths of various cloud-based solutions to improve
business operations and more closely align the cloud/software solution to business process. Cloud tools
make it easier to implement a best-of-breed approach and they also allow for integration between the
differing systems.
During the research phase, demonstrations of several vendor’s solutions were held with RTD business
units to determine the functionality needs and best fit for RTD business processes. Through this series
of demos and requirements gathering sessions, the determination was made that the human resources
and payroll modules will utilize Workday. The human resources and payroll related modules in the second
phase of the ERP replacement project include:

The current Oracle HCM and payroll modules are outdated and do not provide the functionality needed
by RTD. Oracle will end support for the current EBS system in 2021. Over the past eighteen months,
multiple vendors were invited to demo their solutions for these modules with RTD business units. The
Workday solution best fit the needs of the business units as well as the specific public-sector business
needs of RTD. Workday was also chosen because of the dependence and integration needed between
these modules and the finance backbone.
The Board previously approved a total of $15,000,000 for the complete ERP Replacement Program in
the 2018 - 2023 Strategic Budget Plan. The contract authority recommended in this board action will
use a portion of this approved funding for this second phase of ERP program licenses.
DISCUSSION
RTD conducted an RFI to obtain pricing for these modules with the National Association of State Budget
Officers (NASBO). NASBO has pre-negotiated contracts with the State of Colorado. The State bid and
awarded these contracts through their standard procurement processes and these contracts allow other
governmental agencies to utilize them. RTD also investigated using the City and County of Denver (CCD)
Workday contract to take advantage of the discounts provided to the City. CCDs contract is a
cooperative agreement and was competitively bid. Based on review of the two options, CCD’s contract
was more advantageous to RTD.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The contract authority shall not exceed $2,700,000. Funding for these licenses is included in the
approved ERP Replacement Program budget.
The yearly breakdown for the licenses is as follows:
2019
2020
2021
2022
2023

$684,640
$491,295
$491,295

$491,295

ALTERNATIVES

contract to Workday for licenses for the ERP Replacement Program – Phase2 (Human Capital
Management and Payroll) for an amount not to exceed $2,700,000 over 5 years. RTD will be
utilizing the City and County of Denver’s contract with Workday. Subscriptions for the ERP
Replacement Program – Phase 2 will be paid annually.

Approval of Plan Changes to the Salaried
Employee's Pension Plan

CFO/AGM,

Date: December 4, 2018
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: December 18, 2018

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approves the attached Amendment No. 3 regarding plan changes recommended by the Salaried
Employee Pension Trustees.
Core Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management, Task Goal #1 – Fiscal Sustainability, and Task Goal #2 –
Workforce and Human Capital
BACKGROUND
It is the fiduciary responsibility of the Pension Trustees to continually review the plan provisions and
ensuring that they continue to meet the goals of the Pension plan. In August, Rael & Letson the pension
plan actuarial made several recommendations to the plan assumptions.
These recommendations include the following:


For benefits payable as a periodic annuity with an Annuity Start after January 1, 2019, the
adjustment factors for lump sum payments will be actuarially determined based on an interest
rate of 7% instead of the current rate of 7.5%.



Utilize the appropriate RP-2014 Mortality Table for healthy employees and annuitant without the
blue-collar adjustment to achieve the same actuarial impact on the Plan as the table with bluecollar adjustments effective January 1, 2019.
The mortality table was last updated in 2014 and the actuarial made recommendations regarding
some changes based on this pension plans specific experience. The Trustees reviewed the
various tables and determined that the table should be changed to the RP-2014 Mortality Table
for healthy employees and annuitants without blue-collar adjustment, to properly reflect the job
characteristics of the salaried employees in the Plan.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The actuarial recommended contribution prior to these changes would have been $7.95 million/year after
these recommendations the actuarial recommended contribution will be $8.68 million/ year. This is an
increase of $730,000/ year. For 2019, RTD is contributing $5.6 million.

1.B.3

ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors approves the attached Amendment No. 3 regarding plan changes recommended by the
Salaried Employee Pension Trustees.

2. Reject the Recommended Action and the attached resolution, this is not the preferred alternative
as this may have a negative impact on the funding of the pension plan.

DISCUSSION
Attached is the Performance Report for the Third Quarter of 2018. These year-to-date measures provide
a framework in which RTD determines how well it provides service to its passengers and the citizens of
the District within its mission statement objectives. Of the 41 performance measures tracked for the
GM, RTD met 33 of the goals in the first quarter. The following is a discussion of the exceptions.
Goal 3.1 – Maintain System-Wide On-Time Performance
Regional on-time service at 87.0% did not meet goal of 92.0% but was improved over 2017 and only
slightly down from the second quarter.
Goal 4.2 – Reduce Level of Customer Complaints
Complaints per boardings on a system-wide basis were slightly above goal in the third quarter.
carriers except RTD and First Transit-Longmont exceeded goal.

All

Goal 5.1 – Improve ADA On-Time Performance
ADA OTP of 95.9% in quarter three was only slightly below goal of 96.0%. For 2019, the measure will
reflect passenger OTP at 86%, which is consistent with fixed route.
Goal 6.2 – Increase in Ridership
Ridership for the third quarter of 2018 was down 2.0%. In 2017, ridership was down 1.9% for the
year. This mirrors the national trend. The goal for 2018 is an annual measure and the target is positive
ridership growth for the year. We will continue to monitor ridership.
Goal 6.3 – Increase in Fare Revenue and Total Operating Revenue
Third quarter fare revenue and total operating revenue were up 2.3% and 2.1%, respectively, but are
currently short of the budgeted annual goals of 3.0% and 2.6%. The goal for 2018 is an annual
measure and we will continue to monitor this revenue.
Goal 6.5 – Bus Operator/Mechanic Headcount within Authorization
Both bus operator vacancies and mechanic vacancies exceeded their goals at in the second quarter due
to attrition, retirements, system growth, and full employment in the strong local economy.

Report on Status of Fare Implementation

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: December 4, 2018
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: December 11, 2018
Information

BACKGROUND
RTD commits to reviewing its Fare Structure and Fare Programs every three years to determine if any
additions or changes are required to provide the best options for RTD ridership and meet RTD’s revenue
targets. Over the past 20 months, the Pass Working Group and RTD staff reviewed all fares and fare
programs to define potential fare changes and improvements, RTD staff presented a recommendation to
the RTD Board of Directors and received approval mid-September. The goal of this project is to
implement the changes to the RTD Fares, Fare Structure, changes and additions to the Fare Programs as
approved by the RTD Board of Directors.
2019 Approved Changes Summary:
 Cash Fare: $3 Local / $5.25 Regional / $10.50 Airport.
 3-Hour Pass: These fares allow riders to travel for three hours in any direction. This change replaces
the three-hour one-way transfer or ticket.
 Retain ticket book and MyRide discount with modifications (Riders purchasing a 10-ride ticket book
or paying with a MyRide smart card will receive a discount)
 The youth discount will increase from 50 percent to 70 percent and will be solely age-based (ages 619).
 Utilization pricing for pass programs: Pricing for EcoPass, Neighborhood EcoPass, and CollegePass
will now be priced based upon trips taken.
 EcoPass: Other updates to pricing based on changes in service levels and employer categories.
 FlexPass: Discontinue program discount. Employers and employees pay regular monthly pass price.
 New Low-Income Program (Targeting July 2019)
DISCUSSION
The overall program is on target for delivery of scope due January 1. Below is a list of system and
business impacts that RTD IT is coordinating and the remaining activities to complete before January 1.
The project is currently in green status.

Low-Income Program Status
RTD has engaged the State OIT (Office of Information Technology) team to discuss scope of the
Low-Income program and potential options of how the State can support the Low-Income
program through the use of the State PEAK (Program Eligibility and Application Kit) System.
The overall goal is to have this PEAK system, which is already in production, handle as much of
the application process, support and maintenance as possible.
Activities in Progress:
 Conducted business and system requirements workshops
 Kicked off the Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) process for defining the terms and
extent of the collaboration and the associated costs
 Drafted and reviewed the initial business requirements with the State OIT and targeting
to finalize by the end of December
 Initiated the State Order of Magnitude process which will give RTD an idea of the cost of
implementation, support and ongoing maintenance.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

Date: December 4, 2018

From:

Fred Worthen, Assistant General Manager of
Bus Operations

GM

Date:

December 3, 2018

Board Meeting Date: December 18, 2018

Subject:

Purchase 14 45 foot Ultra-Low-Sulfur Diesel
Intercity Flatiron Flyer Buses

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to authorize the purchase of fourteen (14) new forty-five
foot (45’) intercity buses for Flatiron Flyer services from Motor Coach Industries for a price not to
exceed $634,715.17 each and one (1) spare engine and after-treatment for $47,987. The total cost for
the contract is $8,933,999.38.
General Manager’s Goals:
Core Task Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services.
BACKGROUND
In 2012, RTD provided the US 36 Mayors and Commissioners Coalition with an approach to reaching
defined Flatiron Flyer (FF) service levels by 2021. Those service increases – subject to RTD’s service
standards and the District’s financial capacity – were to be funded by two sources:
1. Travel time savings that resulted from the establishment of the managed lanes in the US 36
Corridor; and
2. Operations and Maintenance funds from the Fast-Track’s plan, which provide an increasing
commitment over time.
The fourteen (14) new coaches will support service along the US 36 corridor in compliance with service
standards and commitments made to the Coalition. These are the same coaches selected through
collaborative processes with US 36 stakeholders.
DISCUSSION
Since opening BRT services on the US 36 corridor, RTD has seen ridership increases on the FF routes.
In order to achieve the planned service levels for 2021 and beyond, RTD needs to purchase additional
vehicles for the corridor. The Fast-Track’s plan has allocated funds for the purchase of these vehicles.
Past MCI intercity coaches were purchased under competitive contract. However, contracts and options
for MCI intercity coach purchases expired in 2017. There are no more planned forty-five foot (45’)
intercity coach purchases for six (6) years. Due to the small number of coaches being ordered and the
length of time between upcoming intercity coach purchases, it is advantageous to piggyback on an
existing contract.
In April, 2013, CDOT issued a competitively sourced contract to MCI for Bustang services. The Bustang
MCI coaches are essentially the same as our other FF buses except where parts have been superseded
or designs have been improved. The initial contract has since been extended through March 30, 2019.

Packet Pg. 52

2.B.1

Other entities are allowed to purchase buses on this contract. CDOT has graciously offered to allow the
District to exercise options on their existing contract for this recommended purchase.
Staff is also recommending the purchase of one (1) new spare engine. Current production MCI coaches
have a different engine than the existing fleet to meet air quality specifications. Having an additional
engine on-hand compatible with the new fleet will assist with keeping rolling stock on the road and in
revenue service.
Production of these coaches is expected to begin in late Q3 of 2019 with delivery to be completed in
the last quarter of 2019.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for the purchase of these buses is available in the 2019 Fast-Tracks budget, project 70064.
DBE PARTICIPATION
There is no DBE requirement for transit vehicle purchases. Each vehicle manufacturer is required by the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to submit a DBE plan for FTA approval. As part of the required bid
submittal documents, notice of this approval is provided to vehicle purchasers in the form of a certificate
attesting to this submittal and FTA approval.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to authorize the purchase of fourteen
(14) new forty-five foot (45’) intercity buses for Flatiron Flyer services from Motor Coach
Industries for a price not to exceed $634,715.17 each and one (1) spare engine and aftertreatment for $47,987. The total cost for the contract is $8,933,999.38. This is the
recommended alternative.
2. Do not proceed with the purchase of these intercity buses. This will cause a delay in the
procurement of these vehicles without any expected benefit in cost.

Vanpooling Agreement with DRCOG for 2019

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into an
Agreement with the Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) to provide RTD financial support
and expansion of the DRCOG Way to Go vanpool program in the Denver metropolitan area. This
agreement is for calendar year 2019 and shall be in an amount not to exceed $780,000.
General Manager’s Goal:
Task Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services.

BACKGROUND
Vanpooling is a transportation option in which commuters/employees whose residences are
geographically clustered ride together to and from their work sites in a van that is driven and maintained
by one of the vanpool participants. Typically, the vans carry between six (6) to twelve (12) riders, and
the vehicles are provided by the vanpool program. Vanpools are organized to be sustainable and to render
regular, on-going service to vanpool members on a break-even, cost sharing, fare basis. Vanpools
eliminate the costs associated with dedicated drivers and expensive equipment.
As a transportation mode, vanpools provide personalized transportation at low cost and offer greater
opportunities for increased capacity as compared to carpooling. Vanpools also offer a cost-effective
alternative to conventional transit service in areas of low population density and longer commute
distances.
DISCUSSION
RTD has supported the DRCOG Way to Go vanpool program since 2001. The vanpool program had
previously experienced limited participation due to perceived high fares, insufficient funding for van
acquisition, difficulties in recruiting drivers, and the lack of funding to support necessary marketing
activities. In order to help overcome these barriers, RTD and DRCOG entered into a partnership in April of
2001 to expand vanpool service in the Denver metropolitan area. In doing so, RTD and DRCOG believed
that the organizations could make meaningful advances toward meeting shared goals of offering desirable
mobility options, reducing traffic congestion, and improving air quality in the Denver metropolitan area.
Benefits for RTD include substantial cost savings from avoidance and/or replacement of marginal bus
routes with vanpools. Benefits to both RTD and DRCOG include complementary marketing programs and
increased commuter transportation alternatives.

Packet Pg. 54

2.B.2

RTD financial support is used to help underwrite the vanpool pricing structure in order to make vanpool
fares more competitive in the transportation marketplace. By subsidizing vanpool fares, vanpools are able
to compete with other transit alternatives and are perceived as a more attractive alternative for area
commuters. In addition, RTD support is used to provide incentives to attract and retain vanpool drivers
and to provide capital funding to acquire necessary rolling stock to provide vanpool services. Since the
advent of RTD support for the vanpool program in late 2001, the number of vans has grown from 11 to
93 active vans.
In 2009 the vanpool program became difficult to manage due to a shortage of DRCOG personnel.
DRCOG looked outside their agency at private companies currently operating vanpool services in other
metropolitan areas. After a competitive bid process, DRCOG choose VPSI to operate the vanpool
program. VPSI (Enterprise) took over all operating aspects of the vanpool program. Currently there are
95 active vanpools that carry an average of 5.5 riders per van and the fleet is at 77% capacity.
Vanpool performance will be assessed at the end of the year to determine if performance expectations
have been met and to determine if continuation of the funding agreement is warranted. DRCOG vanpool
performance through September 2018 (thru the 3rd Qtr) resulted in an RTD subsidy per passenger seat of
approximately $3.09.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for RTD support of the DRCOG Van pool program were budgeted in the 2019 RTD budget. This
Agreement will be for a period of one year. Nothing herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this
Agreement.
ALTERNATIVES
1.
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to
enter into an Agreement with the Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) to provide
RTD financial support and expansion of the DRCOG Way to Go vanpool program in the Denver
metropolitan area. This agreement is for calendar year 2019 and shall be in an amount not to
exceed $780,000.
2.
Do not approve the financial support and expansion of the DRCOG Way to Go vanpool program.
This course of action is not recommended as it may result in a reduction to or elimination of the
DRCOG Way to Go vanpool program which would eliminate this transportation option for
residents of the Denver metropolitan area who work/commute in the Denver metropolitan area
and could result in an increase in single occupant commuting.

Contracted Fixed-Route Quarterly Report – 3rd
Quarter 2018

Information

The following is a discussion of the performance measures for the third quarter of 2018 for the fixedroute services provided by private contractors:


PREVENTABLE VEHICLE ACCIDENTS PER 100,000 MILES
The contractors, individually and as a group, met the target of ≤ 2.0 Preventable Vehicle
Accidents per 100,000 miles through the 3rd quarter. First Transit and Transdev continue to
utilize bus operator monitoring technology and post-accident investigations for retraining of
operators. The contractors continue to emphasize safety with all employees at monthly safety
meetings, through periodic campaigns, and with daily reminders at their facilities and on the
street.



PASSENGER ACCIDENT RATIO PER 100,000 MILES
The contractors, as a group, met the target of ≤ 0.18 Passenger Accidents per 100,000 miles
through the 3rd quarter. Transdev did not meet the goal but improved to 0.28 Passenger
Accidents per 100,000 miles compared to 0.31 during the 1st quarter. Just five of the nineteen
passenger accidents that occurred through the 3rd quarter were classified preventable. All of the
bus operators involved in passenger accidents were provided retraining on the proper procedures
for addressing passenger safety. First Transit and Transdev continue to raise awareness of
passenger safety through campaigns and safety meetings to reduce the number of passenger
accidents per 100,000 miles.



ON-TIME PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE INSPECTIONS
The contractors, as a group, met the target of 98% of Preventive Maintenance Inspections
completed as scheduled through the 3rd quarter. Transdev did not meet the goal but improved to
96.5% of Preventive Maintenance Inspections compared to 94.6% completed through the 2nd
quarter 2018. Transdev’s PMI compliance during July, August and September 2018 was 100%.
Competitive Services staff will continue to monitor the contractor operations to ensure PMIs are
completed on time.



ON-TIME PERFORMANCE
The contractors, as a group, met the target of 86% Local On-Time Service through the 3rd
quarter. First Transit Commerce City (83.5%) did not meet the goal due in part to the high
number of new operators, unexpected detours, and traffic. RTD and the private contractors
continue to campaign routes and operators with low on time performance with a strong focus on
first time point departures. On a monthly basis contractors review the OTP report and meet with
operators of low performing routes to discuss factors that are impacting their ability to reach
86% on time performance. Running time issues are forwarded to RTD Service Planning and
Scheduling for review.

Packet Pg. 57

2.C.1

The contractors will continue to address on-time performance issues with operators, but always
tie safety to the discussion. It’s better to be a few minutes late than to have an accident.


MILES BETWEEN LOST SERVICE ROAD CALLS
The contractors, as a group, exceeded the target of 30,000 Miles Between Lost Service
Maintenance Road Calls through the 3rd quarter. Transdev did not meet the goal but improved to
21,972 Miles Between Lost Service Maintenance Road Calls compared to 20,825 though the 2nd
quarter 2018. Deficiencies were originally identified in Transdev’s Preventive Maintenance
Inspection (PMI) and Quality Control (QC) practices. Revised procedures have since been
implemented to address these issues. Competitive Services staff will continue to monitor the
contractor operations to ensure Transdev is addressing this area by completing preventive
maintenance inspections on time, working off defects in a timely manner, monitoring repeat
issues, providing additional training for mechanics, and taking a pro-active approach to
maintaining the buses in their fleet.



OPERATOR COMPLAINTS PER BOARDING
First Transit Longmont met the target of .0004 Complaints per Boarding with .0003 complaints
per boarding in the 3rd quarter. First Transit Denver (.0005), First Transit Commerce City
(.0006) and Transdev (.0007) did not meet the goal. Complaints per boarding continue to reflect
the difficulties experienced due to operator shortages which resulted in a high number of bus late
and bus no show complaints. The contractors continue to investigate and address customer
complaints with operators. The contractors utilize onboard video surveillance as a coaching tool
to assist operators in improving customer interactions. In addition, the steps noted above
regarding on-time performance should help address some customer complaints. The contractors
also continue to address complaint trends with all operators at monthly safety meetings.
The contractors have implemented bus operator wage increase and continue to take a variety of
additional actions over and above contract requirements to address their operator hiring/retention
challenges which include hiring bonuses, incentives to take on additional work, employing a fulltime recruiter, and mentoring programs.

Special Services 3rd Quarter 2018 Report

RTD currently provides Call-n-Ride service in 21 Call-n-Ride service areas throughout the District. The
following is a discussion of Call-n-Ride performance through the 3rd Quarter of 2018.
Boardings
Call-n-Ride services has experienced a 1.5% decrease in ridership year-to-date overall.
ridership for Call-n-Ride Services is as follows:

Year-to-date

Through the 3rd Quarter 2018 – 356,236
Through the 3rd Quarter 2017 – 361,640
Some Call-n-Rides experienced decreases in ridership, which reflects the national/RTD trend. However,
several Call-n-Rides continue to show strong ridership and high productivity. These include those serving
three business parks (Meridian, North Inverness and South Inverness) and the Golden and Superior Calln-Rides (ridership averages 4.4 – 7.7 boardings per hour).
Customer Contacts
Overall, there were 435 calls handled through the Customer Care Center with regard to Call-n-Ride
services through the third quarter of 2018. Of these, 314 were related to requests for new or changes in
services, web site issues, no return call, or other miscellaneous issues. The remaining 121 were related
to operator concerns as follows:

3rd Quarter 2017

In 2018, the reporting of customer contacts was changed to include more information.
Preventable Accidents
Call-n-ride services have seen an increase in preventable accidents as follows:
3rd Quarter 2018 – 11 Accidents (Increase due to new drivers)
3rd Quarter 2017 – 1 Accident
Every operator that has an accident automatically goes to a retraining and counseling process (the
retraining is determined based on the type of accident). Contractors are keeping very detailed records on
safety points (these are points that operators receive for unsafe driving). Operators that exceed a certain

Packet Pg. 61

2.C.2

number are retrained and/or terminated. Safety is number one and discussed constantly with the
operators. A newer safety policy is that a manager talks to each operator as they are pulling out
reminding them to be safe.
Additional Information
It is anticipated that the January re-naming of the Call-n-Ride to FlexRide will help invigorate this general
public on-demand service as customers identify FlexRide as an integrated member of the RTD family of
services that will help them fully utilize RTD for their transit needs.
As previously shared with the Board, Call-n-Ride has evolved over the years to a service where over
60% of the trips are not booked in advance (passengers simply board buses waiting at light rail stations
or along “flex routes”), and a majority of passengers book online rather than “calling” for services.
Consequently, the name “Call-n-Ride” does not fit the way service is provided today. In January, Call-nRide will become FlexRide, and 32 new white Flex-Ride buses will go into service. The remaining green
vehicles will get new FlexRide signage.
In addition, technology changes will be implemented with the January 2019 runboard as follows:



Advanced reservation time reduced from 60 minutes to 10 minutes. The customer can book a trip
10 minutes prior to the desired pickup time, if space is available.
Trip booking can be done on a smartphone app.

These changes will help make FlexRide more attractive to our passengers.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

Date: December 4, 2018

From:

Fred Worthen, Assistant General Manager of
Bus Operations

GM

Date:

December 4, 2018

Board Meeting Date: December 11, 2018

Subject:

Customer Complaint Analysis - 3rd Quarter
2018

Recapped below is an analysis of the customer complaint trends for the 3rd Quarter of 2018.
included is a comparison of customer complaint data for the same period in 2017.

Also

As noted in previous reports, over the past few years the implementation and enforcement of a variety
of policies and operating requirements have impacted the number of customer complaints received.
Examples of the policies and operating requirements that have impacted customer complaints include
securement area/priority seating issues, fare enforcement campaigns, improved Customer Care
availability, introduction of SmartCards and day passes, and changes to bus service associated with the
implementation of the University of Colorado A Line and B Line commuter rail service and the W Line
and R Line light rail service.
Accordingly, based upon recommendations from RTD staff, the Board of Directors has made
modifications to the performance goal for customer complaints to account for these factors. In 2014,
the performance goal was set at .0004 complaints per passenger boarding and has remained at that
level since then.
The “Complaints per Passenger Boarding” for the District as a whole (local bus operations) for the 3rd
Quarter of 2018 was .0004. The “Complaints per Passenger Boarding” for the same period in 2017
was .0004. The RTD operating divisions (Boulder, East Metro and Platte) combined and First Transit
Longmont met the goal for the 3rd Quarter of 2018. First Transit Commerce City, First Transit Denver,
and Transdev did not. The primary generators for increases in customer complaints during this time
period was the lack of operators which led to dropped service and buses running late and a high number
of new operators which led to an increase in “Passed Up Passenger at Stop” complaints.
RTD staff, as well as the private contractors, monitor and address customer complaints on a daily basis.
RTD and the private contractors investigate all customer complaints using a variety of tools, including
CAD/AVL “flashbacks” and video review and address/discipline operators as needed. Many times the
results of the investigation reveal that the complaint is not valid. Some of the reasons for the “Not
Valid” classification include the following:
 Bus was on time (between 1 min early to 5 min late) per “flashback”
 Operator followed proper procedure
 Passenger presented insufficient fare
 Passenger had no proof of eligibility for a discounted fare
 Passenger presented an expired transfer
 Passenger presented a counterfeit pass
 Buses were running late District-wide due to weather
 There was no video evidence to support the complaint

Packet Pg. 66

2.C.3

RTD and the private contractors continue to work collectively in a variety of different areas to address
customer complaints.
 Bus routes with poor on-time performance are monitored by both RTD and private contractor
personnel to determine if the problem is related to the operator or the running time of the route.
 Meetings are held on a monthly basis with contractor and RTD personnel to discuss challenges,
solutions and best practices in the areas of bus maintenance, operations, safety and training.
 RTD conducts refresher training for all operators on an annual basis, and a component of the
training is customer service. The private contractors conduct mandatory monthly safety meetings
wherein they discuss customer service issues and provide suggestions for improving passenger
interactions.
 RTD and private contractor trainers spend time at Civic Center Station and Denver Union Station
the first week of each runboard to provide assistance to operators who may need some
refreshers on station procedures or have questions on their routes.
 RTD has also reached out to the disability community (Colorado Cross Disability Coalition,
Colorado School of the Blind, Atlantis, DRMAC Transit Accessibility Task Force, RTD Advisory
Committee for People with Disabilities-ACPD) to get feedback on ways to improve RTD service
for passengers with disabilities.
 Operators are recognized for the good customer service they provide.
Divisions post
commendations on a bulletin board in the drivers’ room and some provide additional means of
recognition.
 RTD increased operator wages effective March 1, 2018, and the Contractors increased operator
wages effective April 1, 2018. Both RTD and the Contractors have seen an increase in
applicants and employee retention. With the increases in headcount, additional strategies are
being implemented to help reduce the amount of dropped service and the associated complaints.
Historically, and in 2018, the following complaint categories generated the highest number of customer
complaints:
 Bus Did Not Show
 Bus Early
 Bus Late
 Careless Driving/Operator
 Discourtesy/Operator
 Improper Procedure by Operator
 Passed Up Passenger at Stop
All of these complaint categories are what RTD considers “operator related” and are included in the
complaint numbers that are tracked and reported to the Board of Directors on the Quarterly Performance
Report.
The high complaint categories are routinely reviewed to determine the factors, both internal and
external, that are impacting the number of complaints. The input received from both RTD and private
contractor operations is noted below:

Packet Pg. 67

2.C.3

Bus Did Not Show – 3rd Quarter 2018: The complaints in this category increased 10.9% compared to
the same period in 2017. RTD and the private contractors are showing strong improvement regarding
operator headcount.
Although year-to-date, the complaints are higher than 2017, there was
improvement in recent months. Complaints in this category for the period of July-September were
reduced by almost half over the preceding 3 month period. Continuing efforts to reduce operator
vacancies will help ensure that service is provided per published schedules. The YTD average in this
category for 2018 is 8.21 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2017 was 7.40 complaints
per day.
Bus Early – 3rd Quarter 2018: Complaints in this category decreased 3.3% compared to the same period
in 2017. “Flashbacks” for “bus early” complaints often show buses running late. It is possible
passengers see the prior bus running late and will assume it is their bus running early. Operators are
addressed whenever the CAD/AVL playback confirms that the bus was running ahead of schedule. The
YTD average in this category for 2018 is 4.44 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2017
was 4.59 complaints per day.
Bus Late – 3rd Quarter 2018: Complaints in this category increased 1.3% compared to the same period
in 2017. The year-to-date numbers in this category have also been impacted by the operator shortages.
However, improvements to staffing levels have resulted in periodic improvements in this category.
Improving on-time performance continues to be a challenge for a variety of reasons including
construction, traffic and heavy ridership delays; service reductions, which result in the same number of
passengers on fewer trips; and the inability to fund service improvements to address running-time
issues. The YTD average in this category for 2018 is 8.15 complaints per day. The comparable number
for 2017 was 8.05 complaints per day.
Careless Driving/Operator – 3rd Quarter 2018: Complaints in this category decreased 5.0% compared to
the same period in 2017. On a regular basis, video recordings are reviewed and undercover ride checks
are performed to determine if operators are driving in an unsafe or inappropriate manner. In addition,
RTD and the private contractors have “G-Force Activated” event-recording systems (Drive Cam, Smart
Drive) installed on the buses. These incidents are also reviewed on a daily basis. Operators continue to
be counseled and retrained, as needed, to improve driving performance. Also, periodic safety campaigns
are conducted to reinforce safe driving habits. The YTD average in this category for 2018 is 3.59
complaints per day. The comparable number for 2017 was 3.78 complaints per day.
Discourtesy/Operator – 3rd Quarter 2018: Complaints in this category increased 0.2% compared to the
same period in 2017. In the majority of cases, video evidence confirms that the operator followed
proper procedures and treated the customer with respect. In many cases, operators are shown
enforcing or explaining policies (requesting proper fare payment, requesting space in the priority seating
area, addressing inappropriate behavior) in a polite and respectful manner and the passengers react in a
negative manner. Operators are counseled and disciplined if video evidence confirms that they treated
passengers in a discourteous or inappropriate manner. Operators are also given suggestions for handling
similar situations in the future. The YTD average in this category for 2018 is 7.75 complaints per day.
The comparable number for 2017 was 7.74 complaints per day.
Discrimination – 3rd Quarter 2018: Complaints in this category increased 10.8% compared to the same
period in 2017 (from 74 complaints to 82 complaints). Investigation into discrimination-related
complaints usually shows the operator not at fault. The YTD average in this category for 2018 is 0.30
complaints per day. The comparable number for 2017 was 0.27 complaints per day.

Packet Pg. 68

2.C.3

Fare Dispute – 3rd Quarter 2018: Complaints in this category decreased 5.7% compared to the same
period in 2017. The implementation of the new fares and fare equipment presented challenges for some
customers. Investigations into “fare dispute” complaints often show that passengers presented an
improper/incomplete fare and are not happy with the operators’ enforcement of the fare policies. The
YTD average in this category for 2018 is 1.09 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2017
was 1.15 complaints per day.
Improper Procedure/Operator – 3rd Quarter 2018: Complaints in this category increased 7.1% compared
to the same period in 2017. RTD and private contractor training and operations personnel meet on a
regular basis to ensure all operators are receiving consistent and up-to-date information. In addition, the
on-going refresher training provided to RTD operators and the monthly safety meetings held at the
private contractor divisions provide operators with information about accommodating the needs of RTD
passengers to the best of their abilities. In cases where video evidence shows operators are not
following proper procedures, appropriate coaching activities are taken. The YTD average in this category
for 2018 is 6.96 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2017 was 6.49 complaints per day.
Incorrect Info/Operator – 3rd Quarter 2018: Complaints in this category increased 5.2% compared to
the same period in 2017 (from 96 complaints to 101 complaints). The combined efforts of the General
Superintendent of Transportation, Operations Managers, the Bus Operator Training teams, Street
Supervisors and Dispatchers continue to provide operators with up-to-date information to answer
customer questions and address customer concerns. The influx of new operators has also had an
impact on the complaints in this category. The YTD average in the category for 2018 is 0.37
complaints per day. The comparable number for 2017 was 0.35 complaints per day.
Passed Up Passenger At Stop – 3rd Quarter 2018: Complaints in this category increased 13.7%
compared to the same period in 2017. In many cases, “flashbacks” for these complaints will confirm
buses are on route and either on time or running late. It is possible the passenger was not directly at the
stop when the bus arrived. Many complaint comments indicate the passenger was running to the stop
as the bus passed. Operators are reminded to stay vigilant and watch for passengers that may not be
waiting directly at the bus stop. In addition, operators are directed to contact RTD Dispatch whenever a
passenger is passed up due to the bus being full. The number of “Pass Up” complaints from passengers
with disabilities and/or those using mobility aids represents a small number of the total “Pass Up”
complaints (169 of the total 3,280 = 5.46%). Information regarding overcrowded routes is forwarded
to the Service Planning & Scheduling Department for review and adjusted, as needed, and as resources
will allow. The YTD average in this category for 2018 is 12.01 complaints per day. The comparable
number for 2017 was 10.57 complaints per day.
Customer Satisfaction Survey
Customer complaints help identify those areas in which RTD and the private contractors can continue to

2018 Quarter 3 Monitoring Report – Private Contractor Drug and Alcohol
Compliance

In compliance with the Recommendation included in the Performance Audit of the RTD
conducted in 2015 on behalf of the State of Colorado, the following is a summary of the
monitoring activities completed by RTD Drug & Alcohol compliance personnel through
the 3rd Quarter of 2018. These statistics represent the verification of records reviewed
for the private contractor operations.
Number of files reviewed:

1618

Percentage of records in compliance with requirements:

99.5%

All documents pertaining to testing are reviewed every quarter. Once exceptions are
noted, RTD staff returns to the contractor location to ensure that missing documentation
has been obtained. Any exceptions not addressed are noted and reviewed during the
next visit to ensure exceptions have been corrected.
Scheduled visits for the contractors are no less than quarterly and on-going on an asneeded basis. This audit schedule was implemented in March of 2016.

The following is an overview of the performance measures of RTD operations for the Third
Quarter of 2018. Specific information regarding RTD fixed route contracted bus service,
special service, and Access-A-Ride is contained in a separate report also included in this month’s
board packet.


PREVENTABLE ACCIDENTS

through the third quarter. This reflects an improvement over both first and second
quarter service availability numbers. While meeting the goal RTD Bus Operations
continues to strive to improve service availability and reliability throughout the
District.

BUS
OPERATOR/MECHANIC
HEADCOUNT
WITHIN
AUTHORIZATION
o Bus Operations - RTD Bus Operations did not meet goal of ≤ 5.0% vacancy rate
in bus operator positions or the ≤ 7.5% vacancy rate for bus mechanic positions.
The competitive employment market and low unemployment has created a
challenge in both recruiting/retaining. The RTD continues to make improvements
in this area and has increased our various initiatives directed toward enhancing
both recruiting and our work environment. The Board approved the new
Collective Bargaining Agreement and RTD began seeing an increase in the
number of recruits and in improved retention that has continued through the
third quarter of 2018. RTD hired 218 new bus operators through the third quarter
of 2018. There were 171 separations. Twenty-two of those operators retired
after over 20 years of service to the District. This number also includes the
promotion of 10 operators to other positions in the District and 17 operators
went to other Union positions in the District, to include becoming rail operators.



ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:
o Bus Operations:
- The impact from the new CBA Agreement
 Work condition improvements in the area of increased number of straight
runs to 60% on weekdays and 75% on weekends, 13-hour maximum
spread time and improvements in recovery time for operators creates a
demand for more operators. While total service hours for May and August
are lower than 2017 – we have 19 additional runs to fill.
 Salary and work environment improvements have improved both
recruitment and retention.
- Mandates
 RTD continues to request volunteer or mandate operators for a sixth day
of work on a consistent basis. The numbers through the third quarter of
2018 are trending down from last year – both in the month-to-month and
year comparison.
 Special events and bus bridge support do affect our need to mandate.

Recruiting and Retention
 RTD has experienced an increase in class sizes (new class size range from
10-20 students per class)
 Since the new pay increase, graduation rates have improved to 90% in
bus operations. HR has improved the screening and application process
and that has resulted an increased number of qualified applicants, which
has expanded/improved our employee options.
 The number of operators hired to operators separating is the best midyear number in recent history.
Efforts underway to improve workforce stability and continue to reduce service
loss
 Bus/Rail Operations continues to work with our partners throughout RTD
to recruit and retain employees. RTD staff (bus/rail operations,
communications, HR) have attended numerous job fairs and RTD
employment promotion events. This included special events such as:
Taste of Colorado, Blue Shoe Run, Hot Chocolate Run, and various county
workforce seminars and programs.
 RTD maintenance continues to serve as expert advisors to various
technical school boards and conducts recruiting seminars throughout the
region. The DTEC programs continue to prosper as an industry leading
innovation.
 Retention: Improved pay, work schedules and reduction of mandating
have improved both morale and retention. Continuing commitment to
better internal communication – through the following initiatives:
represented employee email; improved mentor programs, buddy system
programs, “Welcome to the Division” initiative for new or transferring
staff members, “Behind the Radio” radio dispatcher visits to the divisions
to meet with employees, improved employee recognition programs and
celebrating individual and staff success have also improved both morale
and retention.

Re:

Service Availability - November 2018

RTD fixed-route bus operations provided slightly over 99.48% of all scheduled hours of bus service
in November 2018. Lost service hours for personnel related reasons reflect a decrease during the
month of November over the same month last year. Although lost service year to date is higher, a
large portion of lost services occurred during the first half of 2018. Service delivery has improved
significantly since June 2018. Lost service for personnel related reasons follows:





November 2018 – 227.90 hours
November 2017 – 449.74 hours
Year to date hours for 2017 - 5,635.10 hours
Year to date hours 2018 – 9,975.76 hours

While RTD did provide in excess of 99.48% of all scheduled hours of service in the month, it was
necessary to cover 2,891 shifts by operators working a 6th day (one of their scheduled days off).
This represents approximately 23,128 hours of service being provided by a “6th day” RTD operator
and does not include the mandated service hours provided by our contractor partners, First Transit
and TransDev. This number is also trending downward with this November numbers lower than
November of last year.

service disruption for the Central Park Bridge Project that required a bus bridge. There were
numerous large special events (two Broncos Games, Veterans Day Parade, Parade of Lights, and
route AB Thanksgiving holiday additional service for capacity). Staff continues to collaborate with

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

Date: December 5, 2018

From:

Michael Ford, Chief Operations Officer

GM

Date:

December 5, 2018

Board Meeting Date: December 11, 2018

Subject:

Access-a-Ride/Cab 3rd Quarter Update

Performance Metrics:
Ridership
Paratransit ridership increased by .6% through the 3nd Quarter of 2018 compared to the same period of
2017, with Access-a-Ride ridership up 2.6%. Productivity remains flat at 1.18 passengers per hour,
(unchanged from the 2nd Quarter of this year). During the same period, Access-a-Cab ridership
decreased by 10%.



Access-a-Ride’s On-Demand, (non-dedicated), service provider is 12.4% below budgeted revenue
hours which has led to both lost productivity and increase to our dedicated service provider hours
to cover all Access-a-Ride run demand.
Due to decreased availability of in-house manpower, we’re currently working with our OnDemand provider to subcontract additional taxi providers to raise available service hours; and
expect those more productive hours to be restored by mid-January 2019. Impact until resolved:
Decreased customer OTP and productivity.

Revenue Hours
Revenue hours of service provided on Access-a-Ride increased by 6.3% during the 3rd
as compared to the same period of 2017.

Quarter of 2018

On-Time Performance
Carrier on-time performance through the 3rd Quarter of 2018 was 96.29%; a slight decrease when
compared to the same period of 2017 (96.36). Note: This metric was in place to track an obsolete
provider standard, and is being retired at the end of 2018
Passenger on-time performance through the 3rd Quarter of 2018 was 87.45%; an increase when
compared to the same period in 2017 (86.22).
Customer Complaints
The number of complaints remains unchanged from the second quarter of 2018, but still remains slightly
up from 2017 with an average of 1.3 complaints per 1,000 passenger boardings in 2018 vs 1.2
complaints in 2017. Staff continues to work with our service providers, APAC, and our passengers to
improve overall customer satisfaction.
Operations Summary:
Mobile Data Computers (Tablets)
Tablets were installed into each Access-a-Ride vehicle between July 9th and the 20th. Devices now offer
operators enhanced functionality with respect to communicating with dispatch as well as real-time
traffic and navigational tools.

The next step is to begin going “paperless” (the removal of paper manifests, and full digital data
used to reconcile daily runs); that testing begins on December 4, 2018 with full paperless to
follow in the next few months.
Final phase is to install tablets on our on-demand vehicles to allow the same accurate and prompt
digital data exchange between our call center and on-demand taxi providers. We are working to
implement this process by early 2019.

Mobile/Web Solution
Scheduled to deploy a passenger information system for AaR customers for web and app. Currently
working to test JAWS screen reader compatibility for the blind and low vision customers with
Routematch development team and members of our APAC committee. Goal for deployment is early
2019.
Routematch Software Enhancements
We are currently testing the delivery of the latest dispatch and scheduling software release which should
allow us the ability to:
 Negotiate pick-up times, thereby improving service delivery and improved efficiencies.
 Optimize same-day trip data and push real-time updates to new vehicle Tablets increasing run
productivity; (better use of slack and idle run time); and improved customer experience,
(increased OTP).
New Call Center Contract
The Call Center service contract was awarded to the incumbent provider First Transit. New contract
service began on October 1st, and includes a comprehensive review of SOPs as it relates to run
productivity; customer service; and best practices in use of our current run scheduling software,
Routematch. We are 30-days through a 90 to 120 review process; and will continue to work with First
Transit’s regional team during this process to make adjustments to maximize service effectiveness and
efficiency.

Quarterly Board of Directors Report
Security Statistics & Fare Inspection Summary
Third Quarter ~ July 1 through September 30, 2018

Fare inspectors, security officers, street supervisors, and police officers, conduct fare inspection on-board buses
and light rail vehicles. RTD’s policy is to provide a warning to first time offenders and then to issue a citation if
that person is contacted a second time without fare. The chart below shows the actual number of patrons
without fare that resulted in warnings or citations. The variation in numbers from month to month may be due
to several factors, including special events or other security security-related incidents.

Plain Clothes Police Officer Fare Inspection

Light Rail Operations
The below chart shows the plain clothes police fare enforcement observations for light rail. There is a slightly
higher fare evasion rate observed by the plain clothes program than for the rail station sweeps and bus
enforcement because of the following factors:
Fare station sweeps are conducted by uniformed security officers; these officers require all patrons to
have fare before boarding vehicles
Rail operators do not have any interface with patrons, while bus operators do ask for fare
Plain clothes police officers do not have a deterrence factor as uniformed officers, thus they inherently
find more violations of fare evasion.
