Retiree Awards
Chair Tobiassen stated that there were no retirees present tonight, but there was a special
recognition award.
Larry Hines – Bus Operator – 24 years
Rubin G. Salas – Service and Cleaning Supervisor – 20 years
Special Recognition
Jerry Torres – Life Saving Award
John Tarbert, Transit Police Chief, recognized Officer Jerry Torres for his assistance in a
pursuit to apprehend a man who fatally shot a man on the 16th Street Mall. The suspect
boarded an RTD bus, and Officer Torres along with a Denver police officer and an officer
from the Department of Homeland Security surrounded the bus with their weapons drawn
in an attempt to take the suspect into custody. At the same time, Officer Torres noticed a
woman in a car trying to get her child out of a car seat near the scene, and he went over
to help her, got them out of their car, and shielded them both from harm.

V.

Public Participation
Chair Tobiassen stated that public participation was open to anyone who wanted to
address the Board. He reminded the audience that each speaker is allowed three minutes.
 Bob Fifer, Arvada Mayor Pro Tem, indicated he was present on behalf of the
Arvada City Council and his constituency regarding the service impact between
Arvada and Denver International Airport (DIA). He stated that since the Arvada A
Line was discontinued over a month ago, and with the delay of the G Line, his
community has been negatively impacted. He added that providing an express bus
that simulated the frequency of the commuter rail to Union Station it would secure
ridership and help people become familiar with the timing and travel through Union





Station to DIA. He formerly requested the Board’s support to provide alternative
service between Olde Town Arvada and Union Station so that travelers could use
this temporary and alternative travel to DIA before the holiday season. He thanked
the Board for their time and service to the community.
Joe Triplett, Aurora, expressed his gratefulness for the new Access-A-Ride buses.
He stated that the lift is wider and the tracks go all the way from the front to the
back. He commented that while the seats fold up, the suspension and shocks have
not improved. He added that this is the first time that RTD has worked with its
customers to improve service and he looks forward to working with RTD in the
future.
General Bernie Rogoff, Greenwood Village, spoke on behalf of the of the United
Veteran’s Committee of Colorado (UVC) to offer their gratitude for offering all
active military personnel free bus service. He noted that currently there are no
transportation options from the new R Line to the new VA Hospital and asked the
Board to review the area to see what could be done.
Bob Wilson, Arvada, echoed Mayor Pro Tem Fifer’s comments. He said the
proposal to establish service from Olde Town Arvada to Union Station is a welcome
one to get people familiar with transferring at Union Station. He added that the
residents miss the Arvada A Line and this proposed new service, would help RTD
with outreach efforts in the community.
Doug Gragg, Denver, said Scott Reed has done a good job of explaining things to
news outlets but noted a lot of people do not watch the news. He proposed
charging the contractors for the lack of good will that has been propagated
throughout the city. He stated that RTD needs compensation and estimated that
RTD needs $11 million dollars which would balance the budget.

Chair Tobiassen asked if there were any other speakers that wished to address the Board.
Seeing none, he thanked everyone who spoke for their comments.

BACKGROUND
In accordance with State law, the District submitted its proposed budget to the
governing body by October 15, 2016. By legal notice, the governing body
presented the proposed 2017 Requested Budget for public review on October 8,

2016. A public hearing to solicit formal public comment is scheduled for the
November 29, 2016 regular meeting of the Board of Directors.
DISCUSSION
The total proposed current year appropriation for the 2017 Recommended Budget
(combined Base and FasTracks) is $2,169.2 million. This includes an operating
expense budget of $626.1 million, interest expense of $160.9 million, capitalized
interest of $33.0 million, new capital expenditures of $301.0 million, debt
payments of $58.9 million, FasTracks management reserve of $15.9 million,
FasTracks Internal Savings Account of $40.6 million, Board appropriated fund of
$29.7 million, capital replacement fund of $15.0 million, unrestricted operating
reserve of $9.7 million, and estimated unrestricted fund balance of $14.3 million.
The previously approved capital (capital carry forward) is $864.1 million. The sum
of the budget appropriation and capital carry forward is $2,169.2 million.
Overview of the 2017 RTD Recommended Budget
Revenues of $1,258.2 million on a combined basis are expected to increase
$174.0 million (16.1%) in 2017 from the 2016 Re-Amended Budget. The increase
is due to 1) an increase in farebox revenue of $20.2 million, 2) an increase in
sales/use tax revenue of $38.5 million, and 3) an increase in grant revenue of
$122.1 million, and 4) an increase in investment income of $0.4 million, offset by
a decrease in other income of $7.2 million.




Combined (Base System and FasTracks) farebox revenues of $150.4 million
are budgeted to increase 15.5% over the 2016 Re-Amended Budget. On
the Base System, fare revenue is budgeted to remain flat in 2017 and
ridership as well is expected to be flat to minimal. For FasTracks, farebox
revenue is budgeted to increase $20.2 million over the 2016 Re-Amended
Budget to $32.9 million due to the full-year operation of the FasTracks
service corridors brought on-line in 2016. The FasTracks estimate is per
the Annual Program Evaluation. Any ridership increases are attributed to
FasTracks.
Sales and use tax revenue of $608.3 million in 2017 is expected to increase
6.7% over the 2016 projected level according to the most recent
September quarterly forecast by the CU-Leeds School of Business.
Compared to the growth rate used in the SBP of 5.2% based on the CULeeds March forecast, the gain is $3.9 million. This differential between
the forecasts used in the SBP and the 2017 Budget is contributed to the
unrestricted operating reserve in the 2017 Budget.







Total Base System grants are projected to increase $30.5 million over the
2016 Re-Amended Budget, including new and carry forward amounts. Base
System grants are estimated to total $148.0 million in 2017; of that
amount, $94.1 million is new grants while projected carryforward grant
funding is $53.9 million. FasTracks grants are budgeted at $328.9 million,
an increase of $91.7 million from the 2016 Re-Amended Budget largely due
to significant projected carryforward grant funding of $119.7 million.
Investment income is budgeted to increase slightly by $0.4 million due to
the impact of continued low short term interest rates coupled with
deployment of invested funds. An expected small increase in interest rates
will stabilize investment income.
Other operating income and other income together will decline by $7.2
million from the 2016 Re-Amended Budget due to the non-recurrence of
$9.0 million released from TABOR reserves in 2016, offset by full-year
payment by the University of Colorado for naming rights on the A Line and
an increase in DUS rental income.

Operating expenditures are budgeted at $626.1 million on a combined basis in
2017 (excluding depreciation), which is $12.2 million lower compared to the 2016
Re-Amended Budget. Base System operating expenses are budgeted to increase
$8.8 million, FasTracks Project operating expenses are budgeted to decrease
$24.8 million, and FasTracks Operations operating expenses are budgeted to
increase $3.8 million. On the Base System, departmental operating expenses are
targeted amounts derived from the SBP and amounts allocated for health insurance
increases for salaried personnel, costs for material salvage, an increase in LRV
spare parts, wages and salary adjustments, and other miscellaneous increases
unknown at the time of the SBP. For FasTracks Operations, the increase is
generally due to full allocation from Base to FasTracks of costs of operating the
new service corridors offset by reclassification of TABOR interest expense to
FasTracks Project. The expense project carryforward to 2017 is $15.0 million for
Base System, $19.9 million for FasTracks Project, and $1.5 million for FasTracks
Operations. It should be noted that substantial reductions were made to
departmental operating budgets to align them with the SBP target, which offset
unanticipated expense increases over 2016.
Diesel fuel is budgeted at the lock price of $1.69 per gallon, compared to a price
of $2.23 per gallon in the 2016 Re-Amended Budget, for year-over-year savings of
approximately $5.3 million. Compared to the budgeted price of $1.80 used in the
SBP, the savings is $1.2 million. This differential between the SBP and actual lock
price is contributed to the unrestricted operating reserve in the 2017 Budget.

Gasoline is budgeted at $2.65/gallon, down from the 2016 per gallon budget price
of $3.00, for year-over-year savings of $0.6 million.
The major changes in operating expenses comparing the Recommended Budget to
the posted Requested Budget are shown in Attachment A. The majority of the
changes from the Requested Budget consist of the expense projects carry-forward.
Interest expense in 2017 is budgeted at $160.9 million on a combined basis, an
increase of $43.6 million over the 2016 Re-Amended Budget. The increase is due
to the inclusion of the TABOR interest expense of $41.0 million as part of the DTO
service payment for the first time in 2017 and new interest expense for the full
year from the 2016 FasTracks bond issuance. This increase is offset by a
reduction to total interest expense from the favorable benefit of bond refinancing.
Of total interest expense, $25.5 million is budgeted for Base System and $135.4
million is budgeted for FasTracks. Capitalized interest (combined) is budgeted at
$33.0 million, the majority of which will occur in FasTracks Project. Capitalized
interest will be part of the actual cash outlay for interest payments in 2017.
Principal payments on debt are estimated at $58.9 million on a combined basis,
which is $2.8 million lower than the 2016 Re-Amended Budget. Base System
principal payments of $48.6 million are $3.3 million lower due to scheduled
amortization of COPs issued for fleet purchases (bus and rail). FasTracks principal
payments of $10.3 million are $0.5 million higher due to refundings and scheduled
principal amortization on current debt. No new debt issuances are planned in
2017 for either the Base System or FasTracks. Both will draw from previously
issued debt to fund major capital purchases and construction in 2017.
Capital expenditures are comprised of both the capital carry-forward from 2016
(previously approved capital) arising from timing of project completion, and new
capital for 2017. The capital carry-forward will be $864.1 million made up of
$166.1 million on the Base System and $698.0 million on FasTracks.
New capital spending of $301.0 million on a combined basis will decrease $219.0
million from the 2016 Re-Amended Budget due mainly to project completion in
FasTracks. New capital spending for FasTracks will decrease $175.8 million to
$234.4 million in 2017 due to on-going project completion on the Commuter Rail
Maintenance Facility, Eagle project, US36 BRT, Northwest Rail and I-225, offset
by increases to North Metro. For the Base System, new capital spending will
decrease $43.2 million to $66.6 million. Of this amount, the Base system will
spend $6.0 million more on facilities construction and maintenance (primarily
Customer Care Center relocation), $1.4 million on Park-n-Rides, and $4.1 million

on systems planning (mostly Colfax Avenue Transit Priority Project). These
increases will be offset by $1.0 million less on bus infrastructure, $49.4 million
less on fleet modernization/expansion (bus and rail), $5.3 million less in capital
support projects (primarily IT support for the District). The Base System new
capital was approved as part of the Strategic Budget Plan in September 2016 and
is the amount identified for minimum “must have” projects.
New capital expenditures for 2017 and the change in new capital in the 2017
Recommended Budget over the previous 2017 Requested Budget/Strategic Budget
Plan are shown in Attachment B. The capital carry-forward expenditures for 2017
and the change in the capital carry-forward in the 2017 Recommended Budget
over the 2016 Re-Amended Budget are shown in Attachment C.
Notable designated fund balance changes include a minimal decrease in the Base
System year-end unrestricted fund balance from the 2016 Re-Amended Budget to
$2.0 million. This projected fund balance is in agreement with the SBP target of
$2.0 million after incorporating all revenue and expense adjustments. The actual
amount realized, however, may be lower (or higher) than that projected due to
lower (or higher) fare revenue and sales tax revenue in 2016 (this will become
evident in the 2017 amended budget). Also on the Base System, the Boardappropriated fund is projected to increase by $7.0 million to $17.4 million, the
capital replacement fund is projected to increase by $2.7 million to $2.7 million,
and an unrestricted operating reserve is established for the first time in 2017 at
$9.7 million.
The FasTracks management reserve (formerly contingency reserve) is budgeted at
$15.9 million. The FasTracks construction reserve is budgeted at $56.3 million.
In FasTracks Project and FasTracks Operations, the Board-appropriated fund,
capital replacement fund, and unrestricted fund are established at 3 months of
operating expenses up from 2 months previously.
On a District-wide basis, the unrestricted fund balance is projected to increase
$2.9 million from the 2016 Re-Amended Budget to $14.3 million. The Boardappropriated fund, the capital replacement fund, and the unrestricted operating
reserve are projected to increase by $25.3 million in total. These increases are in
minimum accordance with fiscal policies for each of the District entities (Base
System, FasTracks Project and FasTracks Operations) per Fund Balance Policy
below.

Cost Recovery Ratio
The 2017 Recommended Budget meets the cost recovery ratio mandated by the
Colorado General Assembly. The estimated SB 154 recovery ratio (all non-tax
revenue except ADA farebox revenues divided by all expenditures, including
depreciation, except ADA expenditures and expenditures incurred for long-term
planning and development of rapid transit infrastructure) exceeds the annual target
of 30% mandated by the General Assembly.
Fund Balance Policy
The Fund Balance Policy for 2017 requires fund balances to consist of a Boardappropriated fund, a capital replacement fund, the remaining unrestricted year-end
fund balance for both the Base System and FasTracks, and an additional
unrestricted operating reserve currently for the Base System. The objective is for
the total of these funds excluding the capital acquisition fund to equal
approximately three months of operating expenses excluding depreciation for both
Base System and FasTracks. The 2017 budget reflects maintenance of a
FasTracks management reserve and construction reserve at levels deemed
sufficient to fund adjustments to the FasTracks construction schedule.
The total of these unrestricted fund balances for 2017 on a District-wide basis is
projected at $68.7 million, comprised of 1) the Board-appropriated fund of $29.7
million, 2) the capital replacement fund of $15.0 million, 3) the unrestricted
operating reserve of $9.7 million, and 4) the remaining unrestricted year-end fund
balance of $14.3 million. The Base System portion of these fund balances listed
for 2017 is projected to total $31.8 million.
Basis of Accounting Used in Budgeting
The accounts of the District are reported using the GAAP accrual basis of
accounting with two exceptions:





Capital outlays and payments of bond principal are treated as expenditures.
Gains and losses on disposal of property and equipment are excluded.
The non-cash portion of the long-term unfunded pension accrual is excluded.
Asset sale proceeds and debt issuance proceeds are included.

Approval to Transfer funds and to Operate Replacement Bus Service between Olde
Town Arvada and Denver Union Station.
It is recommended that the Board of Directors approve the provision of bus service to
operate between the Olde Town Arvada Park-n-Ride and Denver Union Station and further
to transfer up to $500,000 from the FasTracks G-Line operating expense budget to fund
such service through the opening of the G-Line or such time as ridership may warrant
earlier termination.
Motion:

Director Lubow made the Motion to approve
Approval to Transfer funds and to Operate
Replacement Bus Service between Olde Town
Arvada and Denver Union Station.
Director Anderson seconded the motion.

Vote on
the Motion:

Discussion:

The motion passed with 14 in favor (Anderson,

Hoy, James, Lasater, Lubow, Menten, Sisk,
Solano, Tobiassen) and 0 opposed. Director
Walker was absent.

Director Bagley indicated that he fully supports the approval to
transfer funds to create a temporary route from Olde Town
Arvada to Union Station until the G Line opens. He noted that
this is an important litmus test to show how well RTD can
work with its partners.

Director Menten asked for a more detailed explanation of the
dollar amount proposed for this transportation supplement.
Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations,
explained that staff is estimating $2000 a day to provide the
transit services until the G Line is opened. He noted that
pricing is based on running hourly, bi-directional services until
9:00 p.m. He added that the funds should carry RTD shuttle
services until the end of July 2017, if needed.
Director Deadwyler stated that cost shouldn’t be an issue
when suspended services is an issue. She added that she was
disappointed District L had to wait so long for a Board vote to
get the service back.
Director Solano asked if the same 501c3 organization will be
running the shuttle service.
Bruce Abel stated that services will be operated by RTD, but
staff is determining if we will run the route ourselves, or if we
will use one of our contractors. He noted that RTD will no
longer use Ride Provide.
Director Anderson stated that she appreciates the support of
the Board. She noted that while her community looks forward
to the G-Line, it’s imperative to have some form of service in
the meantime. She added that Shelly Cook is grateful for the
support the Board of Directors has given her with her Arvada
A Line bus shuttle services.
Director Hoy asked when the new services would begin.
Bruce Abel stated that staff is still working on the details, but
Staff anticipates a December start time. He noted that staff
still has to determine whether the line can be operated
internally, or if we will need to use a charter company. He
noted that staff’s expectation is to have this service up and
running in the next couple of weeks.
Director Menten asked if staff had considered using vouchers,
similar to the Go Centennial pilot program.

Bruce Abel said yes but remarked that part of the challenge is
getting a program like that organized in a short amount of
time. He noted that staff is better organized to get service up
and running.
Director Solano asked how staff will make up the $500,000
taken from the G Line for this service.
Bruce Abel stated that staff will not have to find new money,
as the funds are currently available. He noted that instead of
being used for the G Line, the funds will go towards this
temporary service instead.

Old Business
Director Bagley read a letter from the Douglas County Commissioners regarding Highlands
Ranch Call-n-Ride Service. He noted that the Board needs to be aware of this letter and
that the service will terminate in January.
Director Folska asked if Director Bagley had an opportunity to explore the Go Centennial
program to see if it could be duplicated for Highlands Ranch.
Director Bagley commented that it is his understanding that LYFT does not operate in
Douglas County. He stated that Douglas County will need to work with RTD on a
different model.
General Manager Genova stated that for the Go Centennial program in addition to LYFT,
there is also a full time mobility van. He stated that staff is exploring various opportunities
and providers to the extent that they are available and economically feasible.
