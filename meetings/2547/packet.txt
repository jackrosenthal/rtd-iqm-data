BACKGROUND
In accordance with State law, the District submitted its proposed budget to the
governing body by October 15, 2016. By legal notice, the governing body
presented the proposed 2017 Requested Budget for public review on October 8,

2016. A public hearing to solicit formal public comment is scheduled for the
November 29, 2016 regular meeting of the Board of Directors.
DISCUSSION
The total proposed current year appropriation for the 2017 Recommended Budget
(combined Base and FasTracks) is $2,169.2 million. This includes an operating
expense budget of $626.1 million, interest expense of $160.9 million, capitalized
interest of $33.0 million, new capital expenditures of $301.0 million, debt
payments of $58.9 million, FasTracks management reserve of $15.9 million,
FasTracks Internal Savings Account of $40.6 million, Board appropriated fund of
$29.7 million, capital replacement fund of $15.0 million, unrestricted operating
reserve of $9.7 million, and estimated unrestricted fund balance of $14.3 million.
The previously approved capital (capital carry forward) is $864.1 million. The sum
of the budget appropriation and capital carry forward is $2,169.2 million.
Overview of the 2017 RTD Recommended Budget
Revenues of $1,258.2 million on a combined basis are expected to increase
$174.0 million (16.1%) in 2017 from the 2016 Re-Amended Budget. The increase
is due to 1) an increase in farebox revenue of $20.2 million, 2) an increase in
sales/use tax revenue of $38.5 million, and 3) an increase in grant revenue of
$122.1 million, and 4) an increase in investment income of $0.4 million, offset by
a decrease in other income of $7.2 million.




Combined (Base System and FasTracks) farebox revenues of $150.4 million
are budgeted to increase 15.5% over the 2016 Re-Amended Budget. On
the Base System, fare revenue is budgeted to remain flat in 2017 and
ridership as well is expected to be flat to minimal. For FasTracks, farebox
revenue is budgeted to increase $20.2 million over the 2016 Re-Amended
Budget to $32.9 million due to the full-year operation of the FasTracks
service corridors brought on-line in 2016. The FasTracks estimate is per
the Annual Program Evaluation. Any ridership increases are attributed to
FasTracks.
Sales and use tax revenue of $608.3 million in 2017 is expected to increase
6.7% over the 2016 projected level according to the most recent
September quarterly forecast by the CU-Leeds School of Business.
Compared to the growth rate used in the SBP of 5.2% based on the CULeeds March forecast, the gain is $3.9 million. This differential between
the forecasts used in the SBP and the 2017 Budget is contributed to the
unrestricted operating reserve in the 2017 Budget.







Total Base System grants are projected to increase $30.5 million over the
2016 Re-Amended Budget, including new and carry forward amounts. Base
System grants are estimated to total $148.0 million in 2017; of that
amount, $94.1 million is new grants while projected carryforward grant
funding is $53.9 million. FasTracks grants are budgeted at $328.9 million,
an increase of $91.7 million from the 2016 Re-Amended Budget largely due
to significant projected carryforward grant funding of $119.7 million.
Investment income is budgeted to increase slightly by $0.4 million due to
the impact of continued low short term interest rates coupled with
deployment of invested funds. An expected small increase in interest rates
will stabilize investment income.
Other operating income and other income together will decline by $7.2
million from the 2016 Re-Amended Budget due to the non-recurrence of
$9.0 million released from TABOR reserves in 2016, offset by full-year
payment by the University of Colorado for naming rights on the A Line and
an increase in DUS rental income.

Operating expenditures are budgeted at $626.1 million on a combined basis in
2017 (excluding depreciation), which is $12.2 million lower compared to the 2016
Re-Amended Budget. Base System operating expenses are budgeted to increase
$8.8 million, FasTracks Project operating expenses are budgeted to decrease
$24.8 million, and FasTracks Operations operating expenses are budgeted to
increase $3.8 million. On the Base System, departmental operating expenses are
targeted amounts derived from the SBP and amounts allocated for health insurance
increases for salaried personnel, costs for material salvage, an increase in LRV
spare parts, wages and salary adjustments, and other miscellaneous increases
unknown at the time of the SBP. For FasTracks Operations, the increase is
generally due to full allocation from Base to FasTracks of costs of operating the
new service corridors offset by reclassification of TABOR interest expense to
FasTracks Project. The expense project carryforward to 2017 is $15.0 million for
Base System, $19.9 million for FasTracks Project, and $1.5 million for FasTracks
Operations. It should be noted that substantial reductions were made to
departmental operating budgets to align them with the SBP target, which offset
unanticipated expense increases over 2016.
Diesel fuel is budgeted at the lock price of $1.69 per gallon, compared to a price
of $2.23 per gallon in the 2016 Re-Amended Budget, for year-over-year savings of
approximately $5.3 million. Compared to the budgeted price of $1.80 used in the
SBP, the savings is $1.2 million. This differential between the SBP and actual lock
price is contributed to the unrestricted operating reserve in the 2017 Budget.

Gasoline is budgeted at $2.65/gallon, down from the 2016 per gallon budget price
of $3.00, for year-over-year savings of $0.6 million.
The major changes in operating expenses comparing the Recommended Budget to
the posted Requested Budget are shown in Attachment A. The majority of the
changes from the Requested Budget consist of the expense projects carry-forward.
Interest expense in 2017 is budgeted at $160.9 million on a combined basis, an
increase of $43.6 million over the 2016 Re-Amended Budget. The increase is due
to the inclusion of the TABOR interest expense of $41.0 million as part of the DTO
service payment for the first time in 2017 and new interest expense for the full
year from the 2016 FasTracks bond issuance. This increase is offset by a
reduction to total interest expense from the favorable benefit of bond refinancing.
Of total interest expense, $25.5 million is budgeted for Base System and $135.4
million is budgeted for FasTracks. Capitalized interest (combined) is budgeted at
$33.0 million, the majority of which will occur in FasTracks Project. Capitalized
interest will be part of the actual cash outlay for interest payments in 2017.
Principal payments on debt are estimated at $58.9 million on a combined basis,
which is $2.8 million lower than the 2016 Re-Amended Budget. Base System
principal payments of $48.6 million are $3.3 million lower due to scheduled
amortization of COPs issued for fleet purchases (bus and rail). FasTracks principal
payments of $10.3 million are $0.5 million higher due to refundings and scheduled
principal amortization on current debt. No new debt issuances are planned in
2017 for either the Base System or FasTracks. Both will draw from previously
issued debt to fund major capital purchases and construction in 2017.
Capital expenditures are comprised of both the capital carry-forward from 2016
(previously approved capital) arising from timing of project completion, and new
capital for 2017. The capital carry-forward will be $864.1 million made up of
$166.1 million on the Base System and $698.0 million on FasTracks.
New capital spending of $301.0 million on a combined basis will decrease $219.0
million from the 2016 Re-Amended Budget due mainly to project completion in
FasTracks. New capital spending for FasTracks will decrease $175.8 million to
$234.4 million in 2017 due to on-going project completion on the Commuter Rail
Maintenance Facility, Eagle project, US36 BRT, Northwest Rail and I-225, offset
by increases to North Metro. For the Base System, new capital spending will
decrease $43.2 million to $66.6 million. Of this amount, the Base system will
spend $6.0 million more on facilities construction and maintenance (primarily
Customer Care Center relocation), $1.4 million on Park-n-Rides, and $4.1 million

on systems planning (mostly Colfax Avenue Transit Priority Project). These
increases will be offset by $1.0 million less on bus infrastructure, $49.4 million
less on fleet modernization/expansion (bus and rail), $5.3 million less in capital
support projects (primarily IT support for the District). The Base System new
capital was approved as part of the Strategic Budget Plan in September 2016 and
is the amount identified for minimum “must have” projects.
New capital expenditures for 2017 and the change in new capital in the 2017
Recommended Budget over the previous 2017 Requested Budget/Strategic Budget
Plan are shown in Attachment B. The capital carry-forward expenditures for 2017
and the change in the capital carry-forward in the 2017 Recommended Budget
over the 2016 Re-Amended Budget are shown in Attachment C.
Notable designated fund balance changes include a minimal decrease in the Base
System year-end unrestricted fund balance from the 2016 Re-Amended Budget to
$2.0 million. This projected fund balance is in agreement with the SBP target of
$2.0 million after incorporating all revenue and expense adjustments. The actual
amount realized, however, may be lower (or higher) than that projected due to
lower (or higher) fare revenue and sales tax revenue in 2016 (this will become
evident in the 2017 amended budget). Also on the Base System, the Boardappropriated fund is projected to increase by $7.0 million to $17.4 million, the
capital replacement fund is projected to increase by $2.7 million to $2.7 million,
and an unrestricted operating reserve is established for the first time in 2017 at
$9.7 million.
The FasTracks management reserve (formerly contingency reserve) is budgeted at
$15.9 million. The FasTracks construction reserve is budgeted at $56.3 million.
In FasTracks Project and FasTracks Operations, the Board-appropriated fund,
capital replacement fund, and unrestricted fund are established at 3 months of
operating expenses up from 2 months previously.
On a District-wide basis, the unrestricted fund balance is projected to increase
$2.9 million from the 2016 Re-Amended Budget to $14.3 million. The Boardappropriated fund, the capital replacement fund, and the unrestricted operating
reserve are projected to increase by $25.3 million in total. These increases are in
minimum accordance with fiscal policies for each of the District entities (Base
System, FasTracks Project and FasTracks Operations) per Fund Balance Policy
below.

Cost Recovery Ratio
The 2017 Recommended Budget meets the cost recovery ratio mandated by the
Colorado General Assembly. The estimated SB 154 recovery ratio (all non-tax
revenue except ADA farebox revenues divided by all expenditures, including
depreciation, except ADA expenditures and expenditures incurred for long-term
planning and development of rapid transit infrastructure) exceeds the annual target
of 30% mandated by the General Assembly.
Fund Balance Policy
The Fund Balance Policy for 2017 requires fund balances to consist of a Boardappropriated fund, a capital replacement fund, the remaining unrestricted year-end
fund balance for both the Base System and FasTracks, and an additional
unrestricted operating reserve currently for the Base System. The objective is for
the total of these funds excluding the capital acquisition fund to equal
approximately three months of operating expenses excluding depreciation for both
Base System and FasTracks. The 2017 budget reflects maintenance of a
FasTracks management reserve and construction reserve at levels deemed
sufficient to fund adjustments to the FasTracks construction schedule.
The total of these unrestricted fund balances for 2017 on a District-wide basis is
projected at $68.7 million, comprised of 1) the Board-appropriated fund of $29.7
million, 2) the capital replacement fund of $15.0 million, 3) the unrestricted
operating reserve of $9.7 million, and 4) the remaining unrestricted year-end fund
balance of $14.3 million. The Base System portion of these fund balances listed
for 2017 is projected to total $31.8 million.
Basis of Accounting Used in Budgeting
The accounts of the District are reported using the GAAP accrual basis of
accounting with two exceptions:





Capital outlays and payments of bond principal are treated as expenditures.
Gains and losses on disposal of property and equipment are excluded.
The non-cash portion of the long-term unfunded pension accrual is excluded.
Asset sale proceeds and debt issuance proceeds are included.

Attachments
As noted above, please refer to the attached Fiscal Year 2017 Recommended
Budget and Fiscal Year 2017 Recommended Budget-Fund Balance (Exhibit I) which
shows the operating/non-operating sources, debt and reserves, and capital sources
as well as operating uses, capital expenditures, and fund balances of the District,
and a reconciliation of net assets. Also attached is the Program Capital Summary
including previously approved capital, an Operating Budget Changes Since Posted

Budget summary (Attachment A), a New Capital Projects summary (Attachment

ALTERNATIVES
1. Adopt the 2017 Recommended Budget. This is the recommended action.
2. Revise the 2017 Recommended Budget and adopt with Board-directed revisions.
3. Do not adopt the 2017 Recommended Budget. This is not recommended since
the District will not be in compliance with State regulations that require the
District to adopt a budget by December 31, 2016. If the District does not adopt
a budget before December 31, 2016, State statute (29-1-108 (3) C.R.S.)
specifies the following penalty:
"Only ninety percent (90%) of the prior year's appropriation for
operations and maintenance purposes and objects is deemed
reappropriated."

Approval to Transfer funds and to Operate Replacement Bus Service between Olde
Town Arvada and Denver Union Station.
It is recommended that the Board of Directors approve the provision of bus service to
operate between the Olde Town Arvada Park-n-Ride and Denver Union Station and further
to transfer up to $500,000 from the FasTracks G-Line operating expense budget to fund
such service through the opening of the G-Line or such time as ridership may warrant
earlier termination.

Director Bagley asked how many of the Directors had participated in the survey.
Barbara McManus, Executive Manager to the Board, said there were 11 full
respondents. She added that there was one partially completed survey, but it was
not counted.
Committee Chair Francone said she could only say so many times, and only so
many emails can be sent to impress upon the importance of completing the
surveys. She said if there were questions, resources are and were available. She
has discussed this with Barbara and Chair Tobiassen and while these responses are

anonymous, she would like to see some way of tracking who has completed and
participated in the various surveys. She said that she does not need to know the
Directors specific answers, but the Directors participations should be tracked.

Director Bagley said the Board is responsible for the management of the General
Manager and that’s why the committee has suggested some type of methodology.
He added that if someone is on this committee, they are obliged to serve their
district and fill out the survey.
Chair Tobiassen said staff would research and find out the best way to move
forward.

Review of GM Self Assessment
General Manger Genova passed out an overview of his self-assessment that was
not included in the Board Packet. He stated that the details were similar to the
previous memo’s the Board received.
Core Goal 1 – Performance Measures
General Manager Genova stated that the third quarter performance measures have
not been put together yet, but they will be available by the final vote in December.
He added that this was a big year regarding service changes, and new services that
were offered. He reminded the Board about the shortage of operators and said that
while numbers had improved, RTD is now in a lull again.
Director Bagley asked if the shortage was for Bus or Rail operators.
General Manager Genova remarked that the shortage affects both departments. He
noted that RTD previously had a policy which stated that light rail operators had to
be hired in house, but that has since changed and RTD can hire externally for those
positions. He added that RTD still requires rail operators to have a Commercial
Driver’s License (CDL), even though that is not a National Transportation Safety
Board (NTSB) requirement.
Chair Tobiassen stated that one of the issues he has seen is that if someone moves
from Bus to Rail, they cannot take their seniority with them.
Director Bagley commented that he went to the Elati Rail Facility to participate in
the simulator and it was very difficult. He recommended that the Board do so as
well.
General Manager Genova said that another goal was to further advance smart card
technology. He said that staff did not get far, but there was advancement. He
Packet Pg. 15

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Oct 25, 2016 3:00 PM (Committee Reports)

Chair Tobiassen asked about the audit results. He said we need to notate the
process and make it very clear to everyone that it is their responsibility as part of
the state audit.

6.A

stated that after the cyber security assessment, RTD has chosen to do additional
work to protect our patrons.
Director Bagley said this is a big issue for the Board as the Xerox contract is six
years old. He added that it is significant for the Board to understand and he is glad
that it is being addressed by both the Board and staff.

General Manager Genova added that RTD has been using a continuous
improvement model to engage employees. He stated that it was been well received
and because of the improvement programs and better communication throughout
the agency, workflow has improved within the agency.
General Manager Genova further added that he has been asked to participate in a
variety of national and regional groups. He stated that RTD has been called upon to
participate in national conferences and webinars. He commented that RTD
continues to influence and lead the industry. He noted that he has added quarterly
press conferences, to be as transparent as possible.
Director Bagley asked that the General Manager’s press conferences be archived on
youtube so that in the future, people can easily access the information.
Core Goal 3 – Strong Financial Management
General Manager Genova said this was the first time RTD has had a Strategic
Budget Plan (SBP) cycle that no new debt was issued. He added that RTD was
also the recipient of a $92-million-dollar grant.
Core Goal 4 – Ensure Equal Employment Opportunity/Affirmative
Action/Disadvantaged Business Enterprise/Small Business Enterprise
General Manger Genova commented that RTD is meeting all of its EEO requests.
He added that RTD hosted a four day national ADA Symposium, and has
established a reasonable modification process for ADA. The ADA office has
established the first ADA review panel, and the Workforce Initiative Now (WIN)
program continues to be reviewed as a national model.
Director Bagley remarked that his understanding is that since RTD established the
WIN program, there are not a lot of other organizations such as CDOT and the City
and County of Denver that must establish the same.
General Manager Genova stated that in order to be successful on a national level,
organizations must provide a ladder of opportunity.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Oct 25, 2016 3:00 PM (Committee Reports)

Core Goal 2 – Strong & Ethical Leadership
General Manager Genova said his appointment to General Manager has been a big
transition for the agency. He added that there has been a lot of shared vision and
collaboration and he has provided testimony at the state capitol five times.

6.A

Director Menten asked where RTD was on modifying the light rail vehicles for ADA
use.
General Manager Genova stated that the modifications will occur over a number of
years, and the retrofit will remove eight seats per vehicle.

General Manager Genova remarked that the priority users of the highblocks and
ramps are for patrons with ADA needs.
Core Goal 5 – Effective Communications and Community Outreach
General Manager Genova stated that a lot of community outreach this year was
done in correlation with the new openings. He added that another issue is the 16th
Street Mall discussion. He has been happy with RTD and how the agency has been
able to work with its stakeholders. He referenced that RTD is doing work on a
national level and noted the various national conferences and committees that RTD
attends and the various awards that RTD has received.
Task Goal Number 1 – Fiscal Sustainability
General Manager Genova said staff will be presenting guiding principles for the
Board to consider on Parking. He added that there was a significant mishap with a
light rail vehicle and the car was significantly damaged, but our team was able to
do all of those repairs in house.
General Manager Genova commented that under exceeds was improvement from
non-profit agency distribution channels and in 2016, RTD executed the first naming
rights contract.
Committee Chair Francone asked if the results of those improvements have seen an
improvement in non-profit agency participation.
General Manager Genova said he would have to come back to the Board with that
information.
Director Bagley said he thought the affordable fare task force was completed, but
now he senses that we are doing it again.
General Manager Genova said staff continues to have dialogue. He commented
that staff didn’t have an endpoint with that group, but we continue to look at
options. One viable alternative is that a third party can come to the table with
funds to fund those passes. What RTD has done with the pass program working
group is that it has approved Board Objectives, and we are identifying the

Director Bagley asked if there was anything in writing that specifies that the light
rail highblocks can only be used for ADA access. He commented that the
highblock usage needs to be reviewed in depth.

members. One of the components will be low income or affordable fare
representation.
Bagley said one of the major issues was working with Mile High Connect that
would come up with the money for an affordable fare program. He thinks having
conversations to keep the lines of communication open is great, but this issue was
already decided.

Director Anderson feels that the transit agency should be at the table, but it is not
responsible for the welfare system
Director Solano was not happy that the check he just signed and was not sure
why.
Director Bagley said we should stick to the agenda at hand and not add additional
questions and information.
Director Francone said she thought General Counsel Marla Lien used to bring the
Board an over view of where we were with legal actions.
Task Goal # 2 Openings of Five FasTracks Rail and BRT corridors in 2016 –
Achieved Goal
General Manager Genova gave an overview of the three lines that are currently
open and an overview of the additional openings of the last two corridors. He
outlined the plan he will bring to Washington for the meeting with the Federal
Railroad Administration (FRA) regarding the University of Colorado A line and the
extension of the current waiver. He stated that he would be traveling with Greg
Straight and Henry Stopplecamp. He commented that staff was on track with the
R Line, but they are targeting mid-December for the opening.
Director Menten asked if General Manager Genova could update the entire Board at
the meeting this evening. He agreed to include this information on his General
Manager’s report this evening.
Director Solano asked if the problems on the University of Colorado A Line had
anything to do with the system Terry Emmons is asking for with regard to safety.
General Manager Genova said this is a separate piece of software and does not
affect the University of Colorado’s A line issues that we are currently experiencing.
He added that the North Metro and SERE are moving along on schedule for 2108
and 2019 respectively.
Packet Pg. 18

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Oct 25, 2016 3:00 PM (Committee Reports)

General Manager Genova outlined how the program worked today and the working
group will examine all of the existing pass programs and evaluate how they were
being used within the working group.

6.A

Task Goal # 3 Technology
General Manager Genova gave an overview of all of the elements of this goal and
where the agency is technology wise. He spoke about Cyber Security and the
Executive session given to the Board. He mentioned that he, along with staff, is
working on real-time information with the concessionaire as it was not spelled out
clearly in the agreement and this is valuable information for service planning and
performance.

Review of GM Fall Performance Survey

General Manager Genova indicated he had not analyzed the results to date and he
would review and respond to any specific comment directed to his current goals
and incorporate as needed.
Chair Francone suggested General Manager Genova take a look at the survey as he
is always interested in what the Board is thinking.

Overview-Evaluation Cycle
Committee Chair Francone said that the General Manager would make any
adjustments to the performance appraisal self-assessment and resubmit to the
committee for the November packet
General Manager Genova said he would provide a highlighted copy of the selfassessment by November 10th.
Committee Chair Francone asked that the committee be fully prepared to make the
appropriate evaluation on November 15th. The committee agreed.

Questions and Next Steps
There were no additional questions or next steps.

• Districtwide Passenger Origin & Destination (O&D) Survey 2015
Lee Cryer, Planning Project Manager, and Ravi Palakurthy, Transportation
Planner, presented the findings of the 2015 District Passenger Origin and
Destination (O& D) Survey.
Lee Cryer stated there were two separate surveys used in the study. The
On-Off GPS survey captured boarding and alighting pairs that provided
accurate recordings of all trips made through transit. The On-Board survey
captured information such as origin, boarding, alighting, destination, mode of
access/egress, transfers and fare media. Both surveys were conducted
Monday – Friday during the Spring and Fall of 2015, however the MallRide
and MetroRide were not surveyed.
Lee Cryer commented that passengers who participated in the On-Off
Survey received bar code cards upon boarding rail and then returned them to
staff when they reached their final destination. Approximately 20% of
passengers were randomly selected; and a total of 62,000 cards were
collected. The On-Board Survey was administered by staff through personal
interviews on rail and bus via tablets and some interviews were coordinated
over the phone. The On-Board survey focused on trip details and personal
and household demographics. A total of 34,800 interviews were conducted
(23,045 for bus and 11,802 for light rail). Both the On-Off and On-Board
surveys were provided in English and Spanish.

Director Bagley asked the FasTracks Committee to highlight two things they
have learned from this data and how RTD will utilize this data in the future.

Director Folska requested the top three findings and the long term
implications of the survey. She asked who conducted the survey, the final
cost of the survey, and why the committee did not get the results for over a
year.
Lee Cryer said the study was conducted by the ETC Institute, of Kansas City
and the final cost of the project was $1.4 million. He noted that the survey
information was collected in 2015 with the analysis completed in 2016.
Director Folska stated that the survey seems similar to studies conducted by
Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) and suggested that RTD
utilize local universities and business instead of going out of state as it
would be more cost effective.
General Manager Genova stated that this presentation is a mere snapshot of
the information that was collected and he was particularly interested in the
increase of people that use pre-paid media. He added that the data collected
will be utilized by staff in many different ways.
Director Lubow asked how the survey was set up. She said it was her
understanding that the federal government conducts similar surveys before
and after projects.
Lee Cryer stated that by understanding the exact route origins, destinations
and trip patterns, RTD will be able to isolate the impacts of the West
corridor. He added that this survey will allow RTD to gain the same
information for all passengers throughout the district.
Lee Cryer added that RTD now has a robust subset of data that gives staff
information on how people are making their trips. This information was
gathered for the entire district because it will allow RTD to improve the
pattern model when forecasting.
Director Walker thanked the survey team and said there was a lot of
information captured. He suggested that this information be shared with
developers, city partners, and stakeholders; as this type of information is
viable to cities when planning their Capital Improvements. He asked if other
Packet Pg. 22

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 1, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Lee Cryer indicated that staff was cleaning up the data and they have not
had the opportunity to delve into the study results or share it broadly
throughout the district yet. Two years after the Eagle project is open, staff
will complete a similar survey to see how passengers travel patterns have
changed as a result of that major investment.

6.B

jurisdictions were contacted regarding this survey and how it can be used to
improve their transit situation.
Lee Cryer said DRCOG will use this data to supplement the household travel
surveys and commercial vehicle survey. Also, the City and County of Denver
is completing a citywide transit plan and they are asking for this data to
assist with their study. In addition, staff will make sure to inform other
municipalities that this data is available for their use.

Lee Cryer remarked that DRCOG’s survey is only done every 10 to 12 years
and it is on a broader spectrum in that it does not have the level of detail
regarding bus ridership as our study does.
Director Francone asked to schedule a time to review the report in more
detail with staff and requested that staff add a map overlay outlining the
different RTD districts.
Director Menten requested a detailed copy of the RTD survey results and a
copy of the last DRCOG household survey.
Director Sisk thanked staff for the survey presentation. He agreed with
Director Folska about the poor timing of the survey, but he stated that this
survey is a great tool to use in our marketing efforts to increase ridership.
Director James stated that if the SmartCard had the tap-off component, RTD
could collect GPS data similar to the information collected in the study, at a
fraction of the cost.
Chair Tobiassien thanked staff for the great information.
Committee Chair Hoy explained that DRCOG conducts studies that enable us
to forecast our future rail lines. The DRCOG survey is region wide but it
does not have all of the detail that we need. DRCOG’s survey results are
dated, but the information that we have collected through this survey is data
that we can use today to work collectively with our partners and
stakeholders.
Lee Cryer remarked that DRCOG does transit surveys but they are region
wide and over 90% of their surveys are based around how people travel by
auto; so they have relatively small subsets.
Director Lubow stated that the survey is a treasure of information and it
would be great to present the results to our stakeholders, but she would like
more information on travel patterns.

Director Anderson asked if DRCOG collects similar information.

6.B

Director Folska asked if survey facilitators received permission to interview
minors for the study. Ravi Palakurthy noted that minors were interviewed if
they had a parent or guardian with them.
Director Folska suggested that the FasTracks Monitoring Committee reach
out to Professor Andrew Goetz at the University of Denver to assess the
survey results.

Director Anderson apologized on the behalf of Shelley Cook regarding the 9 News
story about the discontinuance of the A-line Shuttle from Arvada to Denver
International Airport. Shelley asked Director Anderson to relay her thanks to the
RTD Board for their supportive efforts throughout the years.
Director Bagley stated that his dentist attended the American Dental Association
conference in Denver last month and noted that there were no complaints about the
rail service to and from the airport from anyone attending the conference.
Director James reiterated Director Anderson’s admiration for Shelley Cook, stating
that he had worked with her before. He said the Arvada A-Line Shuttle is a great
example of how the private sector, non-profits and governments can work
collectively with RTD.
Director Francone asked to recognize Doug Monroe for a very nice letter he wrote
to a constituent about the cancellation of the 116. She stated that the customer
was still not happy, but they were satisfied that Doug reached out to them with
sincerity.
Committee Chair Hoy reminded the Board that there will not be any meetings on
Tuesday, November 6th or Tuesday, November 22nd.

C. Updates

• 16th Street Mall Transitway Rehabilitation Project Update
Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager of Planning, stated that Susan
Wood would be updating the Board on the 16th Street Mall Transitway
Rehabilitation Project.
Susan Wood, Planning Project Manager II, commented that RTD allocates
over $1 million annually for the maintenance of the 16th Street Mall transit
way pavers which includes cleaning and replacement. She stated that the
original design was by I.M. Pei and Associates, and was designed to
represent a diamondback rattlesnake. She noted that the original design
lifespan was only for 30 years, and it is now at the 34-year mark.
Susan Wood remarked that federal funding was used to build the mall and it
is also an established historical area. Therefore, RTD has to provide
environmental documentation and will also conduct a Section 4(f) Analysis
to determine alternatives that are prudent and feasible.
Susan Wood stated the purpose of the project is to identify and evaluate
alternative options for the 16th Street Mall, but there is also a need to
Packet Pg. 26

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 1, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Directors Lasater and Solano were absent. Directors Archuleta and Deadwyler left the
meeting early

increase safety for both transit vehicles and pedestrians so as well. She
noted that a technical working group was established this year to evaluate
feasible alternatives in a three step screening process. The alternatives
under consideration are:
 No Action
o This would continue the maintenance program in its current
form and the 30-year lifecycle costs are $42-$43 million.
 Rehabilitation (Reconstruction)
o The Pilot Paver Repair best practices would be extended and
the 30-year lifecycle costs would be $30-31 million.
 Full Concrete: One Color
o The granite pavers would be removed from the transit way
and replaced with concrete while the sidewalks and center
median retain the granite pavers. The 30-year lifecycle costs
would be $8.2-$8.3 million.
 Full Concrete: Two Colors
o The granite pavers would be removed from the transit way
and replaced with colored concrete and stamped in a new
design while the sidewalks and center median retain the
granite pavers. The 30-year lifecycle costs would be $8.5$8.6 million.
 Hybrid: Single Color Concrete
o The granite pavers would be removed from the transit way
and Red center pavers will be reset in the existing diamond
pattern and surrounded with single color concrete. The
Sidewalks and center median will retain the granite pavers.
The 30-year lifecycle costs would be $9-$9.1 million.
Susan Wood remarked that a number of outreach opportunities were held
over the summer. She added that the Denver Post also conducted a poll,
and the comments ranged from those who favored keeping the current
design, to those who would prefer a more cost effective option. She
commented that there is an additional study underway by the City and
County of Denver concerning the use of the mall, including the Mall Shuttle
routing and configuration.
Susan Wood stated that staff will continue to work with our stakeholders to
determine a path forward. In December, staff should present the Board with
a recommendation, and in mid-2017 to mid-2018, the alternative analysis
and environmental documentation will be completed.
Director Folska commented that the Board should wait to get further
feedback from our stakeholders before money is spent to improve the quality
of the mall.

Director Bagley asked if the mall reconfiguration plan included removing the
median.
Susan Wood stated that the Capital Programs group working with RTD’s
constituents will determine the safest and most usable configuration.

Susan Wood stated that the technical working group does not have the
ability to tell RTD what to do, but staff is asking for them to provide input
for the best option.
General Manager Genova said this is a difficult task, and it will be
challenging if the RTD decision is not popular. He added that this is a topic
that has a lot of emotion and passion and there are a lot questions,
particularly regarding funding, that will arise. While the process is
technically in the Board’s hands, it could be challenged by the public.
Susan Wood added that the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) will also
have to approve of the plan.
Director Hoy asked about the technical working group and asked for a
breakdown of its members.
Susan Wood stated that members of the technical working group come
from: The City and County of Denver, Industry Representatives, the State
Historic Preservation Office, and the FTA.
Director Menten remarked that her district is pro-change, and they would like
the mall updated to a more cost effective and safer design.

• 29th & Welton TOD Pilot Project Update
Kate Iverson, Manager of Transit Oriented Development, indicated that RTD
had acquired property from the City of Denver in 1993 for a total of
$97,000. The property, located in the Five Points neighborhood, was
originally purchased to provide parking for local retail businesses after the
loss of the Welton St. parallel parking lane.
Bill Sirois, Senior Manager of Transit Oriented Development, stated that
originally, the community was concerned about parking being lost. RTD
worked with the City of Denver to purchase the property, but there have not
been any parking studies done on this site, and currently, it is mainly used
for light rail parking.

Packet Pg. 28

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 1, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Lubow asked if the technical working group could challenge and or
overturn RTD’s final decision.

6.C

Kate Iverson commented that this was set up as a pilot site to test new
roles for TOD, as this property is located within a residential neighborhood.
Recently, the community has asked for the removal of the parking lot in
order to activate the site for affordable housing. She added that staff has
already met with industry professionals to discuss the best way to develop
the property. She noted that staff’s intent tonight is to get feedback from
the Board, and staff will return at a later date with a recommended action.

Bill Sirois stated it is 19,000 square feet. Kate Iverson added that based on
comparable sales, it is in the $800-$900K range.
Director Francone asked what staff defines as affordable housing.
Kate Iverson indicated that it is more about housing affordability, and a price
point that is becoming more and more scarce.
Director Francone asked how many people park in the lot on a daily basis.
Bill Sirois remarked that there are 50 spaces, but utilization can vary based
on the day.
Director Deadwyler said the parking lot is used often, since parking in that
area has been reduced over the years. She added that the City of Denver is
building a 280-unit complex two blocks away and she would rather use this
lot for something else.
Bill Sirois commented that staff has reviewed various options, but the City is
the land use authority, and their objective is to use this space for residential
purposes.
Committee Chair James said if there is to be a lengthy discussion of
strategy, he recommended the Board discussing that one on one with staff.
Director Walker stated what staff has presented is in line with what he has
heard from other people in the Five Points community, and from the City.
Director Folska inquired about the light rail station at 29th and Welton, and
its future use.
Bill Van Meter indicated that as of now, there are no plans to re-activate that
station.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 1, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Bagley asked about the size of the parcel and what the potential
revenue might be from the sale of the property.

6.C

Director Sisk remarked that he shares some of Director Deadwyler’s
concerns, but the Board should not sell the property until after the
construction defect laws have been changed. He stated we would leave a
lot of money on the table if we were to sell it today.
Director Menten commented that she does not want to see RTD in the Real
Estate business.

Bill Sirois remarked that there has been a fair amount of conversations about
parking for the past year and a lot of concerns were expressed. As a result,
staff has formed a multidisciplinary parking working group to assess issues
and develop a policy and guidance for Board consideration.
Committee Chair James stated this is an opportune time to discuss this
topic.
Director Folska recommended that staff read, The High Cost of Free Parking,
by Donald Shoup.
Director Lubow asked if money from parking goes towards constructing the
unfunded corridors. She said staff should re-evaluate parking fees and
naming rights.
General Manager Genova stated that parking revenues would bring in about
$10 million each year. He added that staff does not have a recommendation
at the moment, but the funds that would be generated would be applied to
smaller projects.
Director Menten asked if RTD’s parking structures could be used for cell
phone towers.
Rolf Asphaug, General Counsel, stated that it would depend on the area and
the structure.
Chair Tobiassen commented that one guiding principal should be to
discourage single occupancy vehicles. He stated that only 17% of the
ridership park at the Park-n-Rides and we need to focus on the majority that
do not. He added that we do not discuss what it would take to replace all
of the parking structures that we have. Nine Mile, for example, will cost
millions of dollars to replace.
Director Anderson remarked that safely has been on her mind lately and the
Board needs to enhance the safety for patrons and their belongings at the
Park-n-Rides.

6.C

Director Bagley stated the revenues that are gained from the various Park-nRides should be returned to the corridors from where it came. He
commented that the revenues should be used for maintenance costs.

• Bylaws and Expense Policy Update

Director Anderson asked if there was a Code of Conduct that applied to the
Board.
Rolf Asphaug stated there is a regular Code of Conduct, and a statutory
Code of Ethics that applies to all government officials.
Director Lubow said she does not like increasing the requirement to a full
majority. She stated that even though Robert’s Rules say to use ten, it also
has language to modify the majority if needed. She also stated that the
proposed changes to the FasTracks committee seems like a demotion, and
she suggested that it always be at the front of the combined meeting.
Director Francone commented that the Board Office Staff should be treated
like the rest of staff, but she asked who will manage that department. She
stated that it should not be the General Manager, otherwise the Board Office
staff will not be able to maintain confidentiality.
Director Bagley stated that the Financial Administration and Audit
Committee is the number one priority for the district, and they should
always go first. He added that the committee structures should be changed,
as the rotations make no sense.
Director Sisk highlighted that staff needs to be careful with the word shall.
He added that he would like to see some reference to the taping of meetings
and making them available to the public.
Chair Tobiassen explained that the Executive Committee has been working
on this for the past few months. He said that for the supervisor of the
Board Office Staff, he would propose that the Board Chair in conjunction
with the General Manager and the Executive Committee choose the
appropriate manager. He added that the Bylaws should not define the
manager by title or name, as the person chosen today might not be the right
person three or five years from now.

Packet Pg. 31

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 1, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Rolf Asphaug, General Counsel, indicated that the goal tonight is for the
Board to provide feedback to staff regarding the Bylaws and Board Expense
Policy before they are approved in November. He said the five general areas
are: Housekeeping, Committee Meetings, Legal Compliance, Bylaw
Amendments and Board Staff Management.

6.C

Barbara McManus, Executive Manager to the Board of Directors, indicated
that the Board Expense policy was being updated to clarify all of the policy
elements, including updating technology standards, updating in and out of
state travel, and professional affiliations/membership subscriptions.
Director Sisk stated that RTD should not pay for any spousal expenses at
local events.

Barbara McManus remarked that Director Menten had asked what the Board
spent for local and travel expenses for 2015 and to date for 2016. That
amount was $90,339.35 to date.
Director Menten stated the Board expenses are a matter of public record and
they deserve to know what is being spent, and what exceptions are being
made.
Director Walker said he is happy this is being done. He stated that when he
used to sign checks, he noticed a few Directors spent a lot of money and
there were times that he did not agree with their spending.
Barbara McManus explained that the Executive Committee would have to
make the decision to reduce the Board’s travel and local expense accounts.
She added that the account limits can change over time for various reasons.
Chair Tobiassen commented that this was eye opening, and he did not
realize the Board Expense Policy was so vague and flexible. He stated that
tightening the policy to be consistent is a good thing, and if staff pushes
back on a particular expense, they can notate a specific section in the
policy.
Committee Chair James remarked that the Board Expense Policy, along with
the Bylaws are clearly areas that need some work.

D. Other Matters
Director Bagley remarked that the Passenger Code of Conduct should come back
before the Board next month. He stated that he would like staff to discuss the
agreed upon language for the utilization of the high blocks at the light rail and
commuter rail stations, specifically for those traveling with luggage.
Rolf Asphaug indicated that he could not recall the specific language, but he would
get back to the Board with that information.

Director Francone added that the Board has asked other departments to cut

General Manager Genova commented that individuals with disabilities have the
priority to use the high blocks.
Director Menten added that she recently went on a tour of the W line in a
wheelchair, and maneuvering around inside the train is another issue.

Directors Menten and Walker noted that they had their prepared recommendations
with them.

Barbara McManus remarked that the 48 voting points were broken down to the
following:
 Exceeds: 23.5
 Achieved: 20.5
 Needs Improvement: 4
Barbara McManus asked if she should include Director Archuleta’s comments into
the final results. Committee Chair Francone remarked that he did not submit them
prior to the meeting, and since he is not here his comments will be excluded.
Committee Chair Francone asked if anyone wanted to share their comments for
Core Goal 1.
Director Bagley commented that to him, it was an achieved goal, but he had
significant issues with the University of Colorado A line, the B line and the smart
card testing.
Chair Tobiassen stated that his recommendation was exceeds. He noted that there
was successful implementation of real time bus tracking, the new fare structure
was incorporated, and noted the consistent on time performance. He added that
the General Manager and staff are quick to respond to unexpected events and do
everything possible to move as many people as possible. Also, the Flatiron Flyer
(FF) was delivered in response to increased service demands.
Director Menten explained that the smart card is still and issue and she is also
disappointed in the time it will take to retrofit the light rail cars for ADA
compliance.
Director Walker shared the same sentiments as Chair Tobiassen and added that the
light rail held a million people for the super bowl parade and it was not built for
that. He noted that the 16th Street Mall Meet in the Streets summer activities were
successful, and coordinating bus routes with new service was also challenging.
Committee Chair Francone remarked that her recommendation was achieved, but
the smart card implementation resulted in a notice to cure to the contractor. She
commented that it took forever to get to that spot and it should have been done
sooner. She added that the super bowl parade should have had better preparation
as it was expected and staff could have coordinated that better.
Packet Pg. 35

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 15, 2016 3:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Committee Chair Francone explained that the goal was to evaluate the General
Manager’s performance and discuss a discretionary payment as well. She asked
Barbara McManus to give the committee an overview of the recommendations.

6.D

Committee Chair Francone asked if anyone would like to share their comments for
Core Goal 2.

Director Bagley stated that his recommendation was exceeds. He stated that the
he agrees with the General Manager’s self-evaluation, and noted that this category
is more about how the agency is performing, not just the General Manager.
Chair Tobiassen remarked that his recommendation was exceeds. He explained
that one thing he looks for is how honestly is the agency communicating with its
stakeholders. He added that staff has done a good job explaining issues, and noted
that the City of Aurora has nothing but the highest praise for RTD. He commented
that the leadership and professional development programs within RTD are paying
off, and employee morale is high. He stated that in regards to the hiring
challenges, it has been approached honestly and the Board and stakeholders were
informed.
Director Walker noted that he chose exceeds for this category because the General
Manager was able to get the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) waiver for the
University of Colorado A line, which was a huge feat.
Director Francone indicated that she chose achieved, primarily because the General
Manager has not had a good opportunity to show the Board what he can do. She
remarked that he has done a good job so far, but she has not seen much of his
individual leadership style. She said that she would like to see more, as the short
time that he has been the General Manager has not allowed him to showcase his
talents.
Committee Chair Francone asked for comments for Core Goal 3.
Director Anderson commented that she chose exceeds and noted that there were
some challenges for the General Manager to meet this year. She noted that he has
done an excellent job working with various communities and even though she is not
sold on doing special accounts to appease elected officials, she gives the General
Manager credit for trying to quell growing criticism. She added that in addition to
the great fuel lock price, she is pleased that service has not been cut.
Director Bagley remarked that the General Manager and Heather Copp have done a
fantastic job, but he has extremely high expectations and he is somewhere
between achieved and exceeds for this goal. He added that the $92 million grant
Packet Pg. 36

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 15, 2016 3:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Anderson commented that after attending several American Public
Transportation Association (APTA) conferences and seeing how RTD is always
treating with respect, she feels that is a clear indication that RTD has exceeded in
strong ethical leadership. She added that some of the recent awards RTD has
received are indicative of those achievements as well.

6.D

that RTD received this year was started four years ago, but the General Manager
reaped the benefits of it this year.

Committee Chair Francone remarked that she chose achieved for this goal. She
stated that she has been impressed with the agency’s ability to examine how we
finance items, all the way to the fuel lock. She added that there has been a shift in
philosophy where RTD is looking to fill up accounts and paying for items as we go,
in order to reducing the borrowing of funds.
Director Walker commented that he chose exceeds. He noted that there were no
service cuts, RTD built and opened new lines, and continues to build out the
district.
Committee Chair Francone moved to Core Goal 4 and asked for any comments.
Director Anderson stated that her assessment was exceeds. She remarked that
while many of these programs were started in the past, the General Manager has
increased their efficiency. She commented that the Colorado Black Chamber of
Commerce gave RTD the Corporation of the Year award and the Rocky Mountain
Indian Chamber gave RTD the First Nations Development Institute award. She
stated that RTD continues to be viewed as a model for workforce development.
Director Bagley remarked that he chose exceeds, and he agrees with the General
Manager’s self-assessment. He said the continuation of the Workforce Initiative
Now (WIN) program, and how it has been adopted by other entities and utilized by
the Federal Transit Administration is significant.
Director Menten stated she chose achieved and she would like to see the
graduation rates.
Chair Tobiassen said that he chose exceeds. He explained that the General
Manager is at the top of the organization and we have an exceptional EEO Manager
as well. They are both extremely knowledgeable, outward reaching and community
focused. He added that RTD has a strong ADA Manager on board now, and
overall, he is impressed with staff. He noted that RTD sponsored the ADA
symposium this summer and he has heard nothing but good things about that
conference.

Packet Pg. 37

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 15, 2016 3:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Tobiassen stated that he chose exceeds for this goal and he concurs that Heather
Copp is a shining star in this organization. He noted that Heather has brought new
vision to the long term outcome and responsibilities of the Pension Trust Board and
both she and the General Manager are brutally honest about RTD’s current financial
position.

6.D

Committee Chair Francone remarked that she struggled with this category. She
stated that the Board rarely receives updates from this department and doesn’t
know what they are doing. She added that the Board never sees Ed Neuberg, and
the outreach efforts are primarily focused on central Denver. She commented that
she had asked the department for outreach in District N and she was not notified
about the function until the day after the event. She stated that the Board receives
the complaints, but they are not notified of the resolution. She said these
measures seem nebulous and vague.
Director Walker added that he has been working with the ADA Office on
recognizing service animals and training staff appropriately, and the training should
occur in January.
Committee Chair Francone moved to Core Goal 5 and asked for any comments.
Director Anderson stated that she agrees with the General Manager’s selfassessment, but she has issues with the postponement of the G Line and how little
the Board knows about what is going on. She remarked that the public is holding
the Board responsible and currently, FasTracks and P3 does not seem to be very
successful.
Director Bagley remarked that he was between exceeds and achieved expectations.
He said there are two issues that are problematic. First, the failure of the mobility
choice action item, and second was getting the 2017 APE passed. He stated that
the General Manager should work with the Board, either one on one, or in small
groups to reiterate the importance of certain items. He explained that if the APE
vote had failed, it would have put RTD in a precarious position.
Director Menten added that there has not been enough communication from the
General Manger to the public or the Board. She said that she was still waiting to
get the results of the forensic evaluation on the University of Colorado A line, and
the Board did not receive any notice about the press conference until the day of.
She stated that the press conference wasn’t taped or put on YouTube and any
meeting like that should be taped.
Director Bagley said the issue of filming Board and Committee meetings is critical
for transparency and accountability. He stated that this organization should
implement video recordings, no matter what the cost is.
Director Menten noted that the City of Littleton does not have written minutes
anymore as all of their meetings are recorded.
Packet Pg. 38

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 15, 2016 3:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Walker stated his recommendation was exceeds. He based that on the
implementation of the EEO Software, the new ADA Manager, the EEO Officer and
the reconfiguration of the light rail cars for ADA.

6.D

Chair Tobiassen reminded the committee that the Board voted against video
recordings and we cannot hold the General Manager accountable for that. He
remarked that it is unfortunate that staff has so many challenges at the moment,
but the General Manager has done a good job.

Committee Chair Francone commented that in this area, the General Manager needs
improvement; primarily for the University of A line communications and failure to
get DTP to quickly move into action. She stated that with respect to community
outreach, she has never seen a staff member at any of the Jefferson County
meetings or events. She noted that Director Folska had been asking for a year for
the results of the On-Board surveys and staff could have explained the process
better to the Board but they did not. She added that there are remaining issues and
questions that have not been addressed.

Evaluate GM Fall Performance Survey
Committee Chair Francone asked if there were any comments for Task Goal 1.
Director Anderson said the committee needs to get together to set the priorities for
next year as she is unhappy about certain things, but now is not the time to bring
them up.
Director Bagley commented that the naming rights, and the $92 million grant were
both in play well before the General Manager took over.
Chair Tobiassen stated that this is one of the most challenging items RTD faces.
With insufficient funds to complete all of the corridors, if the Board is split, it will
not help the agency remain sustainable.
Director Walker added that participation in the reduced fare program has grown.
He stated that RTD needs to provide assistance to those that provide assistance.
Committee Chair Francone noted that she sees improvement in non-profit
distribution channels, making transportation available to more people.
Committee Chair Francone asked if there were any comments for Task Goal 2.
Director Anderson indicated it was great that RTD received the waiver extension
from the FRA, but she needs further assurances that the University of Colorado A
line will be fixed.
Packet Pg. 39

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 15, 2016 3:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Walker said the weekly Monday Morning Q’s, (MMQ’s) give a general
overview of what is happening within the agency, and the weekly General
Manager’s Report has a lot of information. He noted that the 16th Street Mall
discussions have been contentious, but the General Manager has done a good job
of managing those conversations.

6.D

Director Bagley admitted the agency should have been more proactive with
communications regarding the University of Colorado A line.
Director Menten said there are too many questions out there right now. Signage is
still an issue, and we are in a tough spot with the University of Colorado A line and
the Arvada A line shuttle going away. She added that she still receives complaints
about wayfinding through the airport.

Chair Tobiassen commented that opening five corridors in one year is extremely
difficult. We said three of the five are open and two are pending, and hopefully,
they will open soon. He added that North Metro and the Southeast extension are
making progress.
Director Walker remarked that he has worked in construction for 20 years and it is
amazing that anything is built on time, or on schedule.
Committee Chair Francone asked if there were any comments for Task Goal 3.
Director Anderson stated that she would have liked to have seen this finished a
year ago, but she understands there are issues with cyber technology and we do
not want to put our constituent’s information at risk.
Director Bagley said the whole issue with smart cards has been going on for over
six years and it is a major flaw that we used Xerox.
Chair Tobiassen commented that the General Manager has embraced cyber security
and staff brought in Homeland Security who performed an audit of the light rail
system for free. He added that the addition of real time tracking is huge, and an
update to the electronic records system is upcoming. He stated that the
organization is doing work behind the scenes that the Board is unaware of.
Committee Chair Francone stated that while the smart card portal wasn’t
implemented, there have been huge strides by the agency to protect customer
information.
Barbara McManus remarked that the 48 voting points were broken down to the
following:
 Exceeds: 23.5
 Achieved: 20.5
 Needs Improvement: 4

Director Anderson remarked that the Arvada A line Shuttle went away because that
entity’s Board of Directors made the decision, not the RTD Board.

6.D

Director Bagley said he has problems with the University of Colorado A line, the
smart cards, and the mobility choice failure. He noted that he cannot off a
discretionary bonus payment above $10,000 for 2016.
Director Anderson remarked that the automatic salary increase is enough without
the discretionary bonus.
Director Menten stated that she would not offer a discretionary bonus.

Committee Chair Francone stated it is up to 10% of the $275,000 base salary.
Chair Tobiassen commented that he would propose a 4-5% bonus.
Director Walker said this is a difficult decision for him, but he would give 5%.
Committee Chair Francone said she is in favor of no discretionary payment. She
stated that the discretionary is designed to reward exceptional behavior and while
he has done a great job, the General Manager has not been exceptional, nor has he
exceeded her expectations.
Director Anderson indicated that her community is looking at this very closely, and
she will be held responsible if the G line does not open in time. She added that
even though the Board has no control over the delay, they will all be held
accountable for it.
Chair Tobiassen said he is concerned about making a business decision versus
making a political decision. He commented that while the Board is a political entity,
RTD is a business entity and the two should be separate.
Director Francone said the two cannot be separated. The committee is discussing
performance criteria so that the Board can determine if a performance payout is
warranted.
Director Francone remarked that if the entire package is examined, the General
Manager’s base salary is $275,000 with an automatic $10,000 increase next year.
She stated that the automatic increase was in recognition of his excellence, which
does not exclude the possibility of a discretionary bonus for exceptional
achievement. She said if he would have hit all of his marks for this year, of course
the Board would pay him more. She stated that while there were things outside of
his control, he is still responsible for them based on this evaluation.
Director Anderson stated that she does not want to be the only Board member held
accountable by their community. She added that the General Manager has given
his best shot, but he is in this along with the Board, and all of us must show the
Packet Pg. 41

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 15, 2016 3:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Chair Tobiassen asked what was the range for the discretionary bonus.

6.D

Director Walker commented that the measure of a CEO should not be by what they
do, but by what they do not do. He noted that delaying the smart card was the
right decision and the General Manager and his staff have done what they can with
what they have to work with.
Director Anderson reiterated that the University of Colorado A line could go away
until all of the problems are fixed, and that is a very real possibility. She said the
timing for this bonus is wrong, and the Board needs to get through this tough time
first.

Questions and Next Steps
Committee Chair Francone said the next step would be to discuss the discretionary
bonus recommendations with the full Board at the November 29th committee
meeting.

Next Meeting Date: November 29, 2016 - 3:00 - 5:00 p.m.

C. Updates

• Civil Rights Committee Updates
Zamy Silva, Senior Manager of Civil Rights and Acting EEO Manager,
indicated that the Civil Rights Division is currently updating their DBE
Program Plan with the Federal Transit Administration (FTA). The DBE Policy
Statement was revised to reflect current staffing of David Genova – General
Manager, Rolf Asphaug - General Counsel, and Zamy Silva – Acting EEO
Manager. The program plan updates also included changes to the UDDOT
DBE Regulations, new RTD Triennial DBE Goal Methodology, and DBE
contract procedures and provisions.
Zamy Silva added that RTD has received awards of recognition for small and
disadvantaged business efforts in the community from:
 The Colorado Black Chamber of Commerce, who awarded RTD
the Corporation of the Year Award;
 The Colorado Black Roundtable, who awarded RTD as a
Champion of Black Economic Opportunities, and;
 The Rocky Mountain Indian Chamber of Commerce, who awarded
RTD the Corporation of the Year Award
James Cook, Manager of Labor Relations, provided an update of the Equal
Employment Opportunity (EEO) training that the Civil Rights Department is
currently presenting. He noted that EEO is responsible for compliance with
Federal, State and Local laws prohibiting unlawful workplace discrimination
and harassment.

6.E

Director Folska questioned if it was necessary for RTD to have an EEO
department. She asked how Civil Rights differentiates from EEO, and if
some of their functions could be handled through Human Resources.
James Cook noted that the FTA recommends that companies have their own
EEO department. He added that the FTA has also regulated that EEO
departments be separate from Human Resources.
Chair Tobiassen asked what is the minimum age for discrimination.

Director Francone commented that she would like to attend one of the EEO
Discrimination and Harassment presentations.
Director Sisk requested the number of violations that have been reported to
the EEO office within the last year, and asked how many of those resulted in
disciplinary actions or terminations.
James Cook remarked that he did not have the exact numbers with him, but
in most cases, staff does not find evidence of discrimination. He stated that
the number of complaints compared to the number of findings is very
disproportionate, and less than 10% result in a finding.
Committee Chair Deadwyler thanked staff for the presentation and providing
the Board with an update. She added that this will be the final Civil Rights
Committee meeting for 2016, and stated that the Board will determine when
the committee will meet again.

D. Other Matters

B. Recommended Actions

• Approval To Transfer Funds And To Enter Into Contracts With Multiple
Charter Bus Providers For Auxiliary Bus Services
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that
the Board of Directors approves RTD entering into master contracts with
MCITP/MCTS, Ramblin Express, Denver Public Schools, Western
Transportation Services, Colorado Tour Lines (dba.Gray Line) and Ace
Express to provide auxiliary bus service and further to transfer $1,000,000
from the FasTracks Board appropriated reserve to fund such services.
Motion:

Director Bagley made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the November 29, 2016
Board Meeting.
Director Sisk seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations
requested a blanket purchase order to utilize various bus
charter companies to provide necessary bus service as
needed. He stated that in order to process a purchase order, a
funding source needs to be identified, so he is requesting a
transfer of funds from the FasTracks appropriate reserve to be
held into a special account. He added that the primary purpose
of this action item is to provide contingency service planning,
and as the Board may be aware, staff secures the services of
charter companies for Monday and Thursday night football
games. He noted that the funds will not be utilized unless
absolutely necessary. He added that staff anticipates
reimbursement by Denver Transit Partners (DTP) should RTD

need to provide any bus bridge service for the FasTracks
corridors.

Director Deadwyler said she likes this idea, but asked if RTD
would be reimbursed by DTP if we have to call in auxiliary
service for the University of Colorado A line.
Bruce Abel indicated that staff anticipates being reimbursed by
DTP.
Director Francone asked if staff was confident that DTP would
reimburse RTD.
Bruce Abel commented that it would depend on the
circumstances, but there are areas outlined in our contract
that would clearly define reimbursement scenarios.
Director Anderson said she had no comments, but noted that
she would be voting in favor of this item.

• Free Rides for Members of the Military
It is recommended by the Operations & Customer Services Committee that
free rides on RTD for active duty members of the United States Military
should be extended from the presently approved date of December 31, 2016
to December 31, 2017. Utilization has been minimal to date and this
extension will have minimal impact on RTD.
Motion:

Director Folska made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the November 29, 2016
Board Meeting.
Packet Pg. 48

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 15, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Bagley emphasized the importance of this item and
commented that the Board needs to be proactive so staff can
be prepared. He noted that this is will constitute a Plan B,
should there be any issues with the University of Colorado A
line, B line and in the future, the G line.

6.F

Director Deadwyler seconded the motion.
Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager of Communications,
noted that RTD has offered free rides for members of the
Military for the past 10 years. He noted that there is a minimal
financial impact to offering this service, and it is a good
program to offer the military community. He explained that
anyone with an active military ID, or anyone in uniform can
ride RTD’s services for free.
Director Deadwyler asked if RTD kept a tally of how many
people utilize this service.
Bruce Abel explained that staff tallies free rides but there is a
wide variety of groups that utilize the free ride service; so it
would be difficult to pin-point an exact number.
Director Deadwyler added that she has received several calls
where Military constituents were denied their free ride due to
lack of ID. She asked how staff is ensuring that they are
getting a free ride?
Scott Reed stated that military personnel must be in uniform,
or have an active military ID card with them.
Bruce Abel added that the manner in which operators have
been trained require that they be shown an active military ID
card, or military members must be in uniform.
Director Hoy stated that he did not see any language within
the action item that covered Police, EMT or Firefighters.
Scott Reed indicated the policy regarding first responders is a
standing policy without an expiration date, which is separate
from this item.
Bruce Abel explained that this item is usually brought to the
Board around Veteran’s Day, to affirm RTD’s appreciation of
our veterans.
Chair Tobiassen stated that the military personnel he has
worked with greatly appreciate this service offered to them.
He remarked that this provides an opportunity for RTD to let
the military know that we support them.

• RTD Bylaws Amendments
It is recommended by the Executive Committee and General Counsel that the
Board of Directors approve the amended Bylaws as outlined and attached
through the November 15th Operations and Customer Service Committee
meeting.
Motion:

Director Bagley made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the November 29, 2016
Board Meeting.
Director Deadwyler seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Rolf Asphaug, General Counsel, indicated there were a few
changes based on comments from the Board. He noted that
staff added Completion to the FasTracks Committee name
since we are in the completion phase of FasTracks. He
remarked that the order of committee meetings was
suggested, but the calendar changes so often that it will
remain the decision of the Chair and staff as to the order that
best makes sense and to enshrine that in the Bylaws would be
too rigid. He added that most changes were for housekeeping
purposes.
Director Lubow said she will vote against this item due to her
concern of the super majority.
Director Anderson indicated that she would be voting in favor
of this item.

Director Archuleta seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Barbara McManus, Executive Manager to the Board Office
indicated that there were very few changes since the last
meeting, and most were grammatical in nature.
Director Anderson said she would vote in the affirmative for
this item.
Director Menten asked if the annual IT expenses were being
reduced from $2340 to $1680.
Barbara McManus said yes, that was correct. She added that
if the Board wanted to reduce their local or travel expenses,
that would require a separate action item.

C. Updates

Bruce Abel stated that some time ago, Volkswagen (VW) was found guilty
of lying about mileage results to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
and other government agencies. He said there was a settlement, and a
substantial amount of those funds, $61 million to be exact, will be given to
the State of Colorado. He stated that the Colorado Department of Public
Health and Environment (CDPHE) has been charged to determine how the
funds will be used. Included in the Operations & Customer Service packet is
a letter that the General Manager sent to CDPHE requested that a portion of
those funds be set aside for the acquisition of electric transit vehicles and
the related infrastructure and support facilities. He noted that staff will keep
the Board apprised of any updates in regards to RTD’s request.

 A Line, B Line (no back-up)
General Manager Genova said staff had not had an opportunity to brief the
Board on the latest waiver extension from the Federal Railroad
Administration (FRA) for the University of Colorado A line and the B line. He
stated that staff is operating under a new waiver, largely due to the need for
attendants at the rail crossings. He explained that crossing attendants are
only supposed to be used in the short term for emergencies or repair work,
and are not meant to be a long term solution. He noted that the FRA gave
RTD a three-week extension on October 14th, which included a requirement
that an independent assessment of the crossings be completed. Denver
Transit Partners (DTP) brought in HNTB and they worked quickly to
complete the assessment and provide the final report to the FRA.
General Manager Genova said the assessment by HNTB identified five action
items to address. Of those five items, the first two relate to positive train
controls and relating software and the other three were for conventional
train controls. He said the first four are short in duration and they should be
addressed in 8 to 12 weeks. The fifth item relates to more conventional
work and that item has a much longer timeframe; close to 5 to 6 months.
He explained that the new FRA extension is good until February 4, 2017,
and they understand that action item 5 will take longer to implement due to
design, installation and testing. He added that RTD has begun to provide

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 15, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

• VW Settlement - RTD Comments Regarding The Use Of The VW Settlement

6.F

Director Folska thanked staff and said it is clear that they are all working
towards fixing the issues. She added that anytime new software comes
out, it takes time to patch and fix any bugs.
Director Menten inquired about the costs to address items 1-5, and asked if
DTP will be paying for those updates.
General Manager Genova said staff anticipates, and RTD’s stance, is that
DTP will pay for the updates as it is outlined in the concessionaire
agreement. He noted that RTD will pay for RTD travel costs to attend the
FRA meetings, but staff is evaluating opportunities to have our travel costs
reimbursed.
Director Menten asked if any of these changes will address the Quiet Zones.
General Manager Genova said once RTD and DTP work through and
successfully address items 1-5, staff can submit the application for the
Quiet Zones.
Henry Stopplecamp, Assistant General Manager of Capital Programs, said
the applications are ready to go. After issues 1-5 are resolved the
applications can be submitted and they should take three weeks to be
approved.
Director Deadwyler asked how the current extension will work, considering
item 5 will take longer than 90 days.
General Manager Genova indicated that the 90-day extension is to keep
RTD’s feet to the fire to ensure we are working to make progress. He
remarked that he is confident RTD will get another extension as the FRA
fully understood the timing of the five items, and RTD is providing objective
evidence to show improvements.
Director Deadwyler added that she has not had any complaints from her
district lately. She said there have been improvements, and her constituents
are happy.

the FRA with weekly and monthly reports, and staff also committed to
traveling to the FRA headquarters for monthly interface meetings. He
remarked that staff hopes to have made significant progress with the action
plan by December 12th, and we continue to test on the University of
Colorado A line and B line. He commented that staff is unable to perform
tests on the G line until the FRA approves us to do so. He noted that staff
hopes to have more information after the December 12th meeting with the
FRA.

6.F

Director Francone commented that the Board would like to know the
contents of the weekly updates to the FRA and that information should be
shared with the public. She added that there is a lot of misinformation out
there and the more RTD can provide to the public, it would only help them
understand what is going on.

Director Anderson said for the past 14 years, Arvada has had excellent
service to the airport. She stated that right now, people have to go to
Boulder County or drive themselves, and she asked that RTD provide hourly
airport service until the G line is open. She added that RTD should
communicate with Arvada residents to let them know when the G line will
open as she has received several ugly emails. She remarked that RTD staff
should communicate service updates to the public to help her inform the
community.

D. Other Matters
General Manager Genova stated the R line is in its final stages before the
project is completed. He commented that staff is currently working on phase
B2, the most complex area, being tested overnight. He said that staff
anticipates that we will have a firm opening date by the end of the week.
He remarked that the City of Aurora has been a great partner by providing
traffic control and police officers on site during testing.
Director Folska questioned the efficiency of the testing if it is being
conducted during low traffic times. She also asked what the possibility is
for the R line to open by end of the year.
General Manager Genova stated that integrated testing along with a safety
and certification process will take place first. After that initial phase, it will
be turned over to the operations team who will begin training operators and
running the simulated schedule. He stated that this process usually takes 68 weeks. He explained that there are a lot of challenges at the end of the
year, and our stakeholders would prefer not to open during the holiday
season. He indicated that once testing is completed, staff will have a better
timeline of when the line can open.
Director Francone said Accelerate Colorado is very interested in doing
something on the V.I.P. level.

Packet Pg. 54

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 15, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

General Manager Genova said staff discussed that today, and they will see
what information can be pulled from the weekly report to be distributed to
the public. He added that DTP is learning how to escalate issues from an
operations standpoint to make necessary service improvements if there are
issues.

6.F

Bruce Abel added that the Go Centennial pilot project has mirrored the Dry
Creek Call-n-Ride and it has been working with Lyft to provide rides to
constituents. He stated that the City of Centennial is funding the cost of
the trip for people, which originally was from Dry Creek to the rail station.
The month of August averaged 7 trips per day, and September averaged 10
trips per day. Due to low ridership numbers, the pilot program has since
adjusted the service parameters and will now take someone anywhere they
want to go in Centennial.
Director Lubow stated that it is disappointing to hear that the lost service
hours have increased. She said that she was under the impression that the
bonus incentives were assisting in the hiring practices.
Bruce Abel said the applicant flow has slowed down and staff is currently
working with Human Resources and Marketing to find solutions.

Bruce Abel stated that there have been challenges around bus service due to

was a very challenging month and the trend is no longer going in the proper
direction. While lost service hours were significantly down during the
summer months, they have increased and will be an issue until after the
beginning of the year.

B. Recommended Actions

• Amended Annual Audit Plan 2016
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors approves the attached Amended Annual Audit Plan
for 2016.
Motion:

Director Walker made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the November 29, 2016
Board Meeting.
Director Bagley seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Ann Marie Issac-Heslop, Manager of Internal and IT Audit, said
staff is requesting that consideration be given to amend the
2016 Annual Audit Plan. She commented that due of the
complexity of many of the audits included in the plan, staff
would like to move several audits to the 2017 Annual Audit
Plan, as many require an increase of time and resources. She
stated that in order to continue to contribute to the
improvement of RTD’s operations, staff must dedicate the
time and resources to an Audit that will facilitate the best

completed has little relevance compared to the impact that the
recommendations have on the operations of RTD. She noted
that while RTD has expanded over the years, the Audit
department has not.
Director Folska indicated that she would be in full support of
amending the audit plan. She asked what the agency’s plan

was for expanding the human capital needed to keep the audit
department staffed appropriately.

General Manager Genova remarked that every year during the
Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) process, departments have to
address their needs for six years. He noted that as staff
prioritizes everything in the SBP, the reality is that only the
high priority areas are considered. He stated that as staff
examines the 2017 Audit Plan, this would be a good
opportunity to address the number of audits with the Board,
as well as the scope, and possibly, determine if staff should
reduce the amount of audits performed.
Chair Tobiassen commented that auditing is important,
complex and not easy to do. He suggested that the auditor’s
report to the General Manager and the Board as an
independent audit team. He added that he is happy RTD is
stepping up its auditing for IT.
Director Lubow stated that the savings made by these audits
may defray some of the costs of a new employee for this
department. She added that the Board should examine the
annual audits to determine if they still apply.

Committee Chair Menten declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors adopt a 2017 contribution of $4.6 million to
RTD’s Salaried Employees’ Defined Benefit Pension Trust (the “DB Plan”),
which pays a specified monthly benefit at retirement.
It is also
recommended that the RTD Board of Directors adopt a 2017 contribution of
9% of each participant’s eligible compensation to the Salaried Employees’
Defined Contribution Plan (the “DC Plan”), which contributes a specified
amount to the plan for each year of employment.
Motion:

Director Bagley made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the November 29, 2016
Board Meeting.
Director Deadwyler seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Heather Copp, Chief Financial Officer and Assistant General
Manager of Finance and Administration, explained that the
Defined Benefit Pension Trust (DB) Plan is for employees hired
prior to January 2008, and employees hired after that date are
on the Defined Contribution (DC) Plan. With the DB plan,
there is an annual assessment of the plan and it was
recommended that RTD contribute $7.63 million dollars per
year to meet the original payoff date in 2026. She explained
that staff has not been making the recommended contributions
outlined but staff has increased the contributions from $4.1
million to $4.6. She noted that it is a small incremental step,
but RTD will need to make larger contributions in the future in
order to meet the contribution goal. She noted that the
recommendation for the DC plan is 9%, or $3.5 million dollars
to contribute to the plan.
Director Lubow asked if the incremental increases to the DB
plan, with hopes of reaching 100%, is actually obtainable.
Heather Copp said the ability to do that in 2018 is slim. She
added that as staff has discussed previously, we will need to

do something with both plans in the future. She noted that
the salaried plan is a much more robust and stable plan than
the represented plan is at this time. She remarked that at this
time, this is the contribution RTD can make.

• 2017 Salaried Benefit Plan
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors approves the 2017 Plan Year Salaried Benefits plan
and authorizes the General Manager/CEO or his designee to enter into
agreements with the insurance carriers.
Motion:

Director Sisk made the motion to move this item
to the full Board at the November 29, 2016
Board Meeting.
Director Folska seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Heather Copp said this is something that is brought to the
Board annually. She noted that for medical, there are two
providers: Cigna and Kaiser, and the overall net increase is
$634,000.
Director Sisk stated that ¼ of RTD’s employees chose to use
Kaiser. He remarked that Kaiser is less expensive, and he
prefers a single provider option. He recommended that RTD
pay a set dollar amount and if the employee wanted to
participate in the higher cost plan, they would pay the
difference.
Heather Copp stated that a single provider option usually
works for three years, and then the rates begin to increase
significantly.
Director Hoy said he agrees with Director Sisk. He noted that
Adams District 12 opted to use a single provider and it saved
the district a substantial amount of money. He commented
Packet Pg. 61

that eventually RTD needs consider a single source option, or
request that the employee pay the difference for the better
program.
Chair Tobiassen said that he concurs with Directors Sisk and
Hoy, and asked if there are things we can do to incentivize
employees to be healthy.

Director Deadwyler asked why RTD offers Cigna, when there
are other companies that are more comparable to Kaiser’s
rates. She recommended that staff examine all healthcare
providers for competitive rates.
Heather Copp indicated that staff reviews medical providers
almost every year. She stated that most providers do not give
us the same benefits that our current employees have for the
price that we pay.
General Manager Genova added that before Cigna, RTD used
United Healthcare.
Director Francone said fundamentally, healthcare is an
emotional and passionate issue. She stated that while there
are other options, RTD needs to keep in mind our current state
of healthcare and keep in mind what changes future legislation
may bring.
Director Folska suggested that it might be beneficial if a policy
was put in place that if a current health care provider exceeds
a certain benchmark amount, it will then require RTD to look
for another provider.
Director Lubow said some employers may opt to choose a plan
where they pay more because it might offer employees more
options. She stated that perhaps by offering more options,
RTD is a more competitive employer.
Heather Copp stated that RTD strives to offer multiple options
to our employees so they can make the best choices for
themselves.

BACKGROUND
In accordance with State law, the District submitted its proposed budget to the
governing body by October 15, 2016. By legal notice, the governing body presented
the proposed 2017 Requested Budget for public review on October 8, 2016. A public
hearing to solicit formal public comment is scheduled for the November 29, 2016
regular meeting of the Board of Directors.

Overview of the 2017 RTD Recommended Budget
Revenues of $1,258.2 million on a combined basis are expected to increase $174.0
million (16.1%) in 2017 from the 2016 Re-Amended Budget. The increase is due to 1)
an increase in farebox revenue of $20.2 million, 2) an increase in sales/use tax revenue
of $38.5 million, and 3) an increase in grant revenue of $122.1 million, and 4) an
increase in investment income of $0.4 million, offset by a decrease in other income of
$7.2 million.








Combined (Base System and FasTracks) farebox revenues of $150.4
million are budgeted to increase 15.5% over the 2016 Re-Amended
Budget. On the Base System, fare revenue is budgeted to remain flat in
2017 and ridership as well is expected to be flat to minimal. For
FasTracks, farebox revenue is budgeted to increase $20.2 million over
the 2016 Re-Amended Budget to $32.9 million due to the full-year
operation of the FasTracks service corridors brought on-line in 2016.
The FasTracks estimate is per the Annual Program Evaluation. Any
ridership increases are attributed to FasTracks.
Sales and use tax revenue of $608.3 million in 2017 is expected to
increase 6.7% over the 2016 projected level according to the most
recent September quarterly forecast by the CU-Leeds School of Business.
Compared to the growth rate used in the SBP of 5.2% based on the CULeeds March forecast, the gain is $3.9 million. This differential between
the forecasts used in the SBP and the 2017 Budget is contributed to the
unrestricted operating reserve in the 2017 Budget.
Total Base System grants are projected to increase $30.5 million over
the 2016 Re-Amended Budget, including new and carry forward
amounts. Base System grants are estimated to total $148.0 million in
2017; of that amount, $94.1 million is new grants while projected
carryforward grant funding is $53.9 million. FasTracks grants are
budgeted at $328.9 million, an increase of $91.7 million from the 2016
Re-Amended Budget largely due to significant projected carryforward
grant funding of $119.7 million.
Investment income is budgeted to increase slightly by $0.4 million due to
the impact of continued low short term interest rates coupled with

DISCUSSION
The total proposed current year appropriation for the 2017 Recommended Budget
(combined Base and FasTracks) is $2,169.2 million. This includes an operating
expense budget of $626.1 million, interest expense of $160.9 million, capitalized
interest of $33.0 million, new capital expenditures of $301.0 million, debt payments of
$58.9 million, FasTracks management reserve of $15.9 million, FasTracks Internal
Savings Account of $40.6 million, Board appropriated fund of $29.7 million, capital
replacement fund of $15.0 million, unrestricted operating reserve of $9.7 million, and
estimated unrestricted fund balance of $14.3 million. The previously approved capital
(capital carry forward) is $864.1 million. The sum of the budget appropriation and
capital carry forward is $2,169.2 million.

6.G

Operating expenditures are budgeted at $626.1 million on a combined basis in 2017
(excluding depreciation), which is $12.2 million lower compared to the 2016 ReAmended Budget. Base System operating expenses are budgeted to increase $8.8
million, FasTracks Project operating expenses are budgeted to decrease $24.8 million,
and FasTracks Operations operating expenses are budgeted to increase $3.8 million.
On the Base System, departmental operating expenses are targeted amounts derived
from the SBP and amounts allocated for health insurance increases for salaried
personnel, costs for material salvage, an increase in LRV spare parts, wages and salary
adjustments, and other miscellaneous increases unknown at the time of the SBP. For
FasTracks Operations, the increase is generally due to full allocation from Base to
FasTracks of costs of operating the new service corridors offset by reclassification of
TABOR interest expense to FasTracks Project. The expense project carryforward to
2017 is $15.0 million for Base System, $19.9 million for FasTracks Project, and $1.5
million for FasTracks Operations. It should be noted that substantial reductions were
made to departmental operating budgets to align them with the SBP target, which
offset unanticipated expense increases over 2016.
Diesel fuel is budgeted at the lock price of $1.69 per gallon, compared to a price of
$2.23 per gallon in the 2016 Re-Amended Budget, for year-over-year savings of
approximately $5.3 million. Compared to the budgeted price of $1.80 used in the SBP,
the savings is $1.2 million. This differential between the SBP and actual lock price is
contributed to the unrestricted operating reserve in the 2017 Budget. Gasoline is
budgeted at $2.65/gallon, down from the 2016 per gallon budget price of $3.00, for
year-over-year savings of $0.6 million.
The major changes in operating expenses comparing the Recommended Budget to the
posted Requested Budget are shown in Attachment A. The majority of the changes
from the Requested Budget consist of the expense projects carry-forward.
Interest expense in 2017 is budgeted at $160.9 million on a combined basis, an
increase of $43.6 million over the 2016 Re-Amended Budget. The increase is due to
the inclusion of the TABOR interest expense of $41.0 million as part of the DTO
service payment for the first time in 2017 and new interest expense for the full year
from the 2016 FasTracks bond issuance. This increase is offset by a reduction to
total interest expense from the favorable benefit of bond refinancing. Of total interest
expense, $25.5 million is budgeted for Base System and $135.4 million is budgeted for
FasTracks. Capitalized interest (combined) is budgeted at $33.0 million, the majority

deployment of invested funds. An expected small increase in interest
rates will stabilize investment income.
Other operating income and other income together will decline by $7.2
million from the 2016 Re-Amended Budget due to the non-recurrence of
$9.0 million released from TABOR reserves in 2016, offset by full-year
payment by the University of Colorado for naming rights on the A Line
and an increase in DUS rental income.

of which will occur in FasTracks Project. Capitalized interest will be part of the actual
cash outlay for interest payments in 2017.

Capital expenditures are comprised of both the capital carry-forward from 2016
(previously approved capital) arising from timing of project completion, and new capital
for 2017. The capital carry-forward will be $864.1 million made up of $166.1 million
on the Base System and $698.0 million on FasTracks.
New capital spending of $301.0 million on a combined basis will decrease $219.0
million from the 2016 Re-Amended Budget due mainly to project completion in
FasTracks. New capital spending for FasTracks will decrease $175.8 million to $234.4
million in 2017 due to on-going project completion on the Commuter Rail Maintenance
Facility, Eagle project, US36 BRT, Northwest Rail and I-225, offset by increases to
North Metro. For the Base System, new capital spending will decrease $43.2 million
to $66.6 million. Of this amount, the Base system will spend $6.0 million more on
facilities construction and maintenance (primarily Customer Care Center relocation),
$1.4 million on Park-n-Rides, and $4.1 million on systems planning (mostly Colfax
Avenue Transit Priority Project). These increases will be offset by $1.0 million less on
bus infrastructure, $49.4 million less on fleet modernization/expansion (bus and rail),
$5.3 million less in capital support projects (primarily IT support for the District). The
Base System new capital was approved as part of the Strategic Budget Plan in
September 2016 and is the amount identified for minimum “must have” projects.
New capital expenditures for 2017 and the change in new capital in the 2017
Recommended Budget over the previous 2017 Requested Budget/Strategic Budget Plan
are shown in Attachment B. The capital carry-forward expenditures for 2017 and the
change in the capital carry-forward in the 2017 Recommended Budget over the 2016
Re-Amended Budget are shown in Attachment C.
Notable designated fund balance changes include a minimal decrease in the Base
System year-end unrestricted fund balance from the 2016 Re-Amended Budget to $2.0
million. This projected fund balance is in agreement with the SBP target of $2.0
million after incorporating all revenue and expense adjustments. The actual amount
realized, however, may be lower (or higher) than that projected due to lower (or higher)
fare revenue and sales tax revenue in 2016 (this will become evident in the 2017
amended budget). Also on the Base System, the Board-appropriated fund is projected
to increase by $7.0 million to $17.4 million, the capital replacement fund is projected

Principal payments on debt are estimated at $58.9 million on a combined basis, which
is $2.8 million lower than the 2016 Re-Amended Budget. Base System principal
payments of $48.6 million are $3.3 million lower due to scheduled amortization of
COPs issued for fleet purchases (bus and rail). FasTracks principal payments of $10.3
million are $0.5 million higher due to refundings and scheduled principal amortization
on current debt. No new debt issuances are planned in 2017 for either the Base
System or FasTracks. Both will draw from previously issued debt to fund major capital
purchases and construction in 2017.

to increase by $2.7 million to $2.7 million, and an unrestricted operating reserve is
established for the first time in 2017 at $9.7 million.

On a District-wide basis, the unrestricted fund balance is projected to increase $2.9
million from the 2016 Re-Amended Budget to $14.3 million. The Board-appropriated
fund, the capital replacement fund, and the unrestricted operating reserve are projected
to increase by $25.3 million in total. These increases are in minimum accordance with
fiscal policies for each of the District entities (Base System, FasTracks Project and
FasTracks Operations) per Fund Balance Policy below.
Cost Recovery Ratio
The 2017 Recommended Budget meets the cost recovery ratio mandated by the
Colorado General Assembly. The estimated SB 154 recovery ratio (all non-tax revenue
except ADA farebox revenues divided by all expenditures, including depreciation,
except ADA expenditures and expenditures incurred for long-term planning and
development of rapid transit infrastructure) exceeds the annual target of 30%
mandated by the General Assembly.
Fund Balance Policy
The Fund Balance Policy for 2017 requires fund balances to consist of a Boardappropriated fund, a capital replacement fund, the remaining unrestricted year-end fund
balance for both the Base System and FasTracks, and an additional unrestricted
operating reserve currently for the Base System. The objective is for the total of these
funds excluding the capital acquisition fund to equal approximately three months of
operating expenses excluding depreciation for both Base System and FasTracks. The
2017 budget reflects maintenance of a FasTracks management reserve and
construction reserve at levels deemed sufficient to fund adjustments to the FasTracks
construction schedule.
The total of these unrestricted fund balances for 2017 on a District-wide basis is
projected at $68.7 million, comprised of 1) the Board-appropriated fund of $29.7
million, 2) the capital replacement fund of $15.0 million, 3) the unrestricted operating
reserve of $9.7 million, and 4) the remaining unrestricted year-end fund balance of
$14.3 million. The Base System portion of these fund balances listed for 2017 is
projected to total $31.8 million.
Basis of Accounting Used in Budgeting
The accounts of the District are reported using the GAAP accrual basis of accounting
with two exceptions:
Packet Pg. 70

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 15, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

The FasTracks management reserve (formerly contingency reserve) is budgeted at
$15.9 million. The FasTracks construction reserve is budgeted at $56.3 million. In
FasTracks Project and FasTracks Operations, the Board-appropriated fund, capital
replacement fund, and unrestricted fund are established at 3 months of operating
expenses up from 2 months previously.

ALTERNATIVES
1. Adopt the 2017 Recommended Budget. This is the recommended
action.
2. Revise the 2017 Recommended Budget and adopt with Board-directed
revisions.
3. Do not adopt the 2017 Recommended Budget. This is not recommended
since the District will not be in compliance with State regulations that
require the District to adopt a budget by December 31, 2016. If the
District does not adopt a budget before December 31, 2016, State
statute (29-1-108 (3) C.R.S.) specifies the following penalty:
"Only ninety percent (90%) of the prior year's appropriation for operations and
maintenance purposes and objects is deemed reappropriated."
Motion:

Director Folska made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the November 29, 2016
Board Meeting.
Chair Tobiassen seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Jannette Scarpino reminded the Board that the Strategic
Budget Plan (SBP) discussions began in April, and it was
approved in September along with the 2016 Annual Program
Evaluation (APE). She said the Highlights to the 2017
Recommended Budget are as follows:

• FasTracks Bond Sale Update
Brenden Morgan updated the Board on the sale of the FasTracks bonds. The
bonds were sold on October 27th, prior to the school bonds showing up on
the election ballots. He stated that RTD sold $195 million worth of bonds,
and the sale is scheduled to close this week.

Tonya Anderson, Manager of Electronic Fare Operations, said the EcoPass
and CollegePasses have been consistent over the past couple months. She
noted that the total monthly taps for October were approximately 1.57
million. She added that staff has completed installation and training in all
King Soopers locations but there is a bit of a challenge with the upcoming
holidays as Albertsons/Safeway and King Soopers will not start using new
software during their busy season.
Heather Copp stated that Xerox is still working through the PCI compliance
document. She said that they will deliver their final document to RTD in
mid-December and if they meet their dates, staff will be able to determine
when we can go live with the web portal.
Director Folska stressed that RTD is paying Xerox over $28 million dollars
for this project and we should be setting the expectations and timeline. She
added that RTD should not pay for services not rendered.
Heather Copp clarified that they have not been paid in full; they have only
been paid for services that they have completed.

D. Other Matters
Director Francone congratulated the returning directors. In addition, she recognized
the City of Denver’s partnership in making sure there will be temporary shelters at
Civic Center. She gave a big thank you to Anthony Graves for mediating and
assisting in getting the approval.

Public Participation
Chair Tobiassen stated public participation was open to anyone that wanted to address the
Board. He reminded the audience that each speaker is allowed three minutes.
 Roger Partridge, Douglas County Commissioner – District II, said he was here to
speak on behalf of the Highlands Ranch Call-n-Ride. He stated that the county
understands the issue and appreciates the opportunity to work with RTD to find a
solution to continue this service. He remarked that Douglas County has yet to
receive a formal proposal from RTD, but he looks forward to the opportunities and
possibilities that will be presented. He asked the Board to move this item to staff
so they might consider all of the options and present them to both the RTD and
Douglas County Boards.
 Joan Peck, City of Longmont City Council, remarked that she was here to discuss
the State Highway 119 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) funding and the FasTracks Internal
Savings Account (FISA). She stated it was important that the 119 BRT work with
the Northwest Area Mobility (NAMS) Study and more importantly, that it does not
compete with FasTracks. She commented that passing the 119 BRT item will
allow for the examination of various funding options, and it is also needed for the
leverage of Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) funds. She further
requested that the Board consider transferring FasTracks revenues in excess to the
FISA, for future FasTracks construction.
 Dennis Coombs, City of Longmont – Mayor, commented that the City of Longmont
felt so strongly about the 119 BRT Study that the City sent two representatives to
speak to the Board about this item. He requested that the funding item be passed,
as it was the City’s understanding that the funding was already in the approved
budget. He asked that the Board pass this item so that it can move to the next
phase of the process.
 Tina McDonald, Northglenn, commented that she attended the ADA Paratransit
Advisory (APAC) Committee last week, and while there, she had asked who was
paying for the decorative concrete and art at the commuter rail stations, while the
ADA Community is asking for improvements to stations. She added that trying to
get reservations to the APAC Committee was impossible. She noted that while the
two presidential candidates were in town, the Text Telephone (TTY) lines did not
work. She added that RTD does not have a dedicated phone line, email or text
number for people to make Call-n-Ride reservations. She noted that she had asked
an employee to make the reservations for her, but that was denied because the

Director Walker stated he has been riding the light rail for 17 years. He commented that
every morning the trains are spotless, but every evening they are exceedingly untidy. He
said the cleaning crews do a tremendous job in getting the trains nice and clean every
morning.

calls must be recorded. She asked the Board when they were going to sit down
with the ADA community to discuss these issues.
Karlan Huffman, Denver, noted that she lives at the Yale Station Apartments, but
the 27 and 46 Buses only run on the weekdays. She said that because of this, the
residents do not have any way to get around on the weekends. She added that the
ramp at Yale Station is too steep and the residents cannot get up the ramp to the
light rail platform without assistance from others.
Suzanne McFarland, Highlands Ranch, indicated that she was the HR Manager at Vi
Highlands Ranch, an assisted living facility. She said that she is consistently trying
to inform her residents about the Call-n-Ride Service and she hopes that the Board
will extend, or expand the program. She remarked that the residents at Vi are
losing their independence, and being able to use transportation is important. She
added that the residents would like to be able to call and set up their rides on their
own, and she hopes to increase the awareness among her residents that the Call-nRide service will be utilized in the area.
Regan Bryd, Denver, stated that she is one of the RTD Board Candidates for District
A. She noted that she attended the Board meeting because she saw the proposal
to cut the Highlands Ranch Call-n-Ride on the meeting agenda. She remarked that
Highlands Ranch already suffers from lack of public transportation in general and
her alma matter, Mountain Vista HS, wrote letters to the Board that were included
in the packet. She encouraged the Board to reexamine how and when a service is
going to be cut. She said that there needs to be a way to integrate conversations
before service changes are submitted. She also asked the Board to use this
opportunity to examine how it conducts business and communicates with the
community. She added that change is needed, regardless of who wins the RTD
elections.
Doug Tisdale, Cherry Hills Village, indicated that he too is a candidate for the RTD
Board, representing District H. He wanted to express his concurrence of
Commissioner Partridge’s comments and noted his confidence that there would be
a positive dialogue between the RTD Board and Douglas County. He added that he
hopes there is creativity and collaboration in keeping the Highlands Ranch Call-nRide.
Robert Dennis, Aurora, remarked that behind the Chili’s at the Southmoor Park-nRide, there needs to be a ramp from the station to the shopping center. He said at
the moment, there is a divider and a 5-foot elevation and he was hoping that the
Board would consider ramp access to rectify the inaccessibility.

Recommended Action
A.
Budget Transfer for SH 119 Bus Rapid Transit Environmental Clearance and Basic
Engineering
It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the RTD
Board of Directors approve a transfer of $3.5 million from the Planning expense grant
project budget to a new capital project for the SH 119 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT)
Corridor, which will permit staff to seek consultant services for assistance in the
preparation of National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review and Advanced Basic
Engineering services. A total of $1.5 million in funding for this project was approved in
the 2016 Amended Budget in the Planning expense grant budget, and the remaining
funds are planned for 2017 and 2018 in the 2017-2022 Strategic Budget Plan (SBP).
Motion:

Director Sisk made the motion to approve the
Budget Transfer for SH 119 Bus Rapid Transit
Environmental Clearance and Basic Engineering.
Director Anderson seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Director Bagley indicated that he wanted everyone on the
Board to know that he read the letter from the 36 Mayors
Coalition and he had read the Northwest Mobility Study, and
he is in full support of this item. He added that it is imperative
that the Board move this forward.
Director Francone stated it was her understanding that this is
not a FasTracks project, nor does the funding come from the
FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA). She asked
Heather Copp to explain the funding amounts.
Heather Copp, Chief Financial Officer and Assistant General
Manager of Finance and Administration remarked that the
original funding was for $3.5 million over three years. She
stated that staff is asked for that total amount to be advanced
this year so that staff can issue the Request for Proposal
(RFP).
Director Lubow commented that she is in support of this item.
She added that while she is an advocate for Rail, her
stakeholders want the BRT because they do not know when
the Northwest Rail will arrive. She highlighted that this action

Director Hoy said his previous committee vote was no, but he
has reconsidered the issue and after recent conversations with
his stakeholders, he will be voting yes tonight.
Director Anderson asked if this was a planning grant from
Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG).
Heather Copp remarked that a portion of it is from DRCOG,
and the rest is made up of RTD funds.
Director Anderson stated that she would be supporting this
item since it will not be paid by FasTracks.
Director Solano asked for the name of the firm that will be
completing the study.
Heather Copp stated that a firm had not been selected, and
one of the main reasons staff wants to issue the RFP is to
award the project to a firm.
Chair Tobiassen commented that the completion of this study
is important, and by doing so, it would allow RTD to apply for
future grants.

Proposed Winter 2016/2017 Service Changes

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of
Directors approve the Winter 2016/2017 Service Change package as revised and
summarized in Attachment A resulting in an annualized cost savings of approximately
$1,337,000 and, further, to authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute
contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is impacted by
these changes.
Motion:

Director Bagley made the motion to approve the
Proposed Winter 2016/2017 Service Changes.
Director Anderson seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Director Lasater said he would like to give some insight to the
possible incoming Director from District H. He stated that
about this time last year, the Parker Call-n-Ride was on the
chopping block. Eugene Howard came up with the funds and
Parker established a taskforce to increase ridership, but
Highlands Ranch has not been as fortunate. He highly
encouraged the new Director for District H to find solutions in
Highlands Ranch because this is not the first time the
Highlands Ranch Call-n-Ride has been up for service cuts. He
added that he appreciates Douglas County and their
willingness to fund a portion of the service.
Director Bagley remarked that he has been on the Board for
seven years and ten months and the Highlands Ranch Call-nRide has always had issues meeting the service standards
requirements. He stated that he has met with Commissioner
Partridge, and there is time over the next month to have
further conversations with Douglas County. He commented

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, said
the initial staff recommendation was for the cancellation of the
Highlands Ranch Call-n-Ride. After several conversations,
staff revised the recommendation, which is included in the
Board Packet this evening. He added that the Highlands
Ranch Call-n-Ride Service is contingent upon the receipt of
50% of the operating costs from Douglas County, or another
source outside of RTD.
Director Francone asked if there was a timeline for Douglas
County to provide the funds.
Bruce Abel stated that the service changes are for winter, so
staff would need to be informed of Douglas County’s decision
by the end of November.
Director Lubow asked what happens if Douglas County is not
able to raise half of the cost need to keep the Highlands Ranch
Call-n-Ride, and inquired if there were any creative ways to
address the funding issue.
Bruce Abel said in order to keep the service, RTD needs to
receive half of the cost of the service from Douglas County, or
another entity.
Director Menten stated this has been a problematic route and
inquired if this was the first time RTD has asked for joint
funding to keep a route on the schedule.
Bruce Abel remarked that RTD has participated in cost sharing
with Douglas County, but those agreements were for at time
certain and are no longer in place.
Director Menten commented that if Douglas County and their
partners do not come to agreeable terms, and are
subsequently unable to provide half of the funding to keep the
Call-n-Ride, we can remove this service.

Packet Pg. 86

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Oct 25, 2016 5:30 PM (Approval of Board Meeting Minutes of October 25, 2016)

that this is the highest cost Call-n-Ride and asked Bruce Abel
to discuss the current state of the Call-n-Ride service.

Authorization to enter into contract with Protran Technology for purchase of
Railway Worker Protection Early Warning System (16DR0003)
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to enter into a contract not to
exceed $1,500,000 with Protran Technology for the purchase of a Railway Worker
Protection Early Warning System and associated equipment (Contract Number 16DR003).
Motion:

Director Anderson made the motion to approve
the Authorization to enter into contract with
Protran Technology for purchase of Railway
Worker Protection Early Warning System
(16DR0003).
Director Sisk seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Director Bagley stated that after his experience on the rail
simulator, it is imperative that the Board vote for this. He
remarked that the maintenance of way workers need to be
protected.

Transfer FasTracks Sales and Use Tax Revenues in Excess of Forecasted Sales and
Use Tax Revenues to FasTracks Internal Savings Account
It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the RTD
Board of Directors approve transferring FasTracks sales and use tax revenues (.4%)
from unrestricted fund balance to the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) on an
annual basis when actual sales and use tax revenues (.4%) collected for the calendar
year exceed the forecasted sales and use tax revenues (.4%) projected in the adopted
budget each year. The actual sales and use tax revenues will be determined based on
the audited financial statements.
Motion:

Director Folska made the motion to approve the
Transfer of FasTracks Sales and Use Tax
Revenues in Excess of Forecasted Sales and Use
Tax Revenues to FasTracks Internal Savings
Account.
Director Solano seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Director Anderson asked if the FasTracks Internal Savings
Account (FISA) can be used for all of the items on the original
FasTracks Ballot, such as construction, service and operations.

Packet Pg. 88

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Oct 25, 2016 5:30 PM (Approval of Board Meeting Minutes of October 25, 2016)

Director Solano commented that initially, he voted no on this
item, but he will support it tonight. He added that it is critical
for RTD’s rail workers to have the protections they need.

General Manager Genova said yes. He added that originally,
the FISA resolution was for the unfunded corridors and it
requires that all FasTracks money is to be used on FasTracks
projects.
Director Anderson stated that she is concerned that there will
be another deep recession similar to 2008. She commented
that she never wants to cut service unless something drastic
happens, and she will support this if in the future, the funds
will be applied to operations.
Director Menten commented that she will be voting no on this
item. She said this is tying our hands and she would prefer
more flexibility in the future.

General Manager Genova indicated that staff continues to work very closely with the City
of Denver and RTD has shelters in stock and are ready to go as soon as we get the City’s
approval.
Director Folska directed the Board and staff to her website, and to her book, Making ¢ of
Pedestrian Oriented Developments, which explicitly outlines how the Yale and Southmoor
Stations were failures. She said it is an interesting issue and read.
Director Solano commented that the Board and staff continue to address problems with
Access-a-Ride and other ADA issues, but we need to get something done. He stated that
the Chair has requested this be addressed after the first of the year.
Director Folska inquired about the status of the customer satisfaction survey.
Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager of Planning, said the West Corridor After Eagle
Project for On Board survey, which was completed in conjunction with federal
requirements, will be presented to the Board next week.

New Business
Director Francone reiterated Director Bagley’s comments about the rail simulator at the
Elati facility. She said it is fun, and asked Barbara McManus, Executive Manager to the
Board, to set up a field trip for the Board to see it first-hand. She added that she
remembers a lot of people argued about the price of the simulator, but it was well worth
the cost.
Director Walker stated he was appointed to the APTA Leadership Committee, which
selects the APTA Leadership Participants. He commented that it is a two-year
appointment and the first meeting will be held at the beginning of December.
Director Bagley noted he, along with Directors Hoy and James, attended the Rail~Volution
Conference that was held in San Francisco, CA. He remarked that this is the best
conference to attend as it relates to housing, land use and other important transportation
issues. He suggested that the Board attend this conference as it is valuable from a Board
education standpoint.
Director James commented that he attended the Mobility Summit in Chicago last week,
and this week he would be attending the 8th North American Infrastructure Leadership
Forum in Denver. He stated both conferences had an emphasis on technology, and he

DISCUSSION
The total proposed current year appropriation for the 2017 Recommended Budget (combined
Base and FasTracks) is $2,169.2 million. This includes an operating expense budget of $626.1
million, interest expense of $160.9 million, capitalized interest of $33.0 million, new capital
expenditures of $301.0 million, debt payments of $58.9 million, FasTracks management reserve
of $15.9 million, FasTracks Internal Savings Account of $40.6 million, Board appropriated fund
of $29.7 million, capital replacement fund of $15.0 million, unrestricted operating reserve of
$9.7 million, and estimated unrestricted fund balance of $14.3 million. The previously approved
capital (capital carry forward) is $864.1 million. The sum of the budget appropriation and capital
carry forward is $2,169.2 million.
Overview of the 2017 RTD Recommended Budget
Revenues of $1,258.2 million on a combined basis are expected to increase $174.0 million
(16.1%) in 2017 from the 2016 Re-Amended Budget. The increase is due to 1) an increase in
farebox revenue of $20.2 million, 2) an increase in sales/use tax revenue of $38.5 million, and 3)
an increase in grant revenue of $122.1 million, and 4) an increase in investment income of $0.4
million, offset by a decrease in other income of $7.2 million.

Combined (Base System and FasTracks) farebox revenues of $150.4 million are budgeted
to increase 15.5% over the 2016 Re-Amended Budget. On the Base System, fare
revenue is budgeted to remain flat in 2017 and ridership as well is expected to be flat to
minimal. For FasTracks, farebox revenue is budgeted to increase $20.2 million over the
2016 Re-Amended Budget to $32.9 million due to the full-year operation of the FasTracks
service corridors brought on-line in 2016. The FasTracks estimate is per the Annual
Program Evaluation. Any ridership increases are attributed to FasTracks.
Sales and use tax revenue of $608.3 million in 2017 is expected to increase 6.7% over
the 2016 projected level according to the most recent September quarterly forecast by
the CU-Leeds School of Business. Compared to the growth rate used in the SBP of 5.2%
based on the CU-Leeds March forecast, the gain is $3.9 million. This differential between
the forecasts used in the SBP and the 2017 Budget is contributed to the unrestricted
operating reserve in the 2017 Budget.
Total Base System grants are projected to increase $30.5 million over the 2016 ReAmended Budget, including new and carry forward amounts. Base System grants are
estimated to total $148.0 million in 2017; of that amount, $94.1 million is new grants
while projected carryforward grant funding is $53.9 million. FasTracks grants are
budgeted at $328.9 million, an increase of $91.7 million from the 2016 Re-Amended
Budget largely due to significant projected carryforward grant funding of $119.7 million.
Investment income is budgeted to increase slightly by $0.4 million due to the impact of
continued low short term interest rates coupled with deployment of invested funds. An
expected small increase in interest rates will stabilize investment income.
Other operating income and other income together will decline by $7.2 million from the
2016 Re-Amended Budget due to the non-recurrence of $9.0 million released from
TABOR reserves in 2016, offset by full-year payment by the University of Colorado for
naming rights on the A Line and an increase in DUS rental income.

Operating expenditures are budgeted at $626.1 million on a combined basis in 2017 (excluding
depreciation), which is $12.2 million lower compared to the 2016 Re-Amended Budget. Base

System operating expenses are budgeted to increase $8.8 million, FasTracks Project operating
expenses are budgeted to decrease $24.8 million, and FasTracks Operations operating expenses
are budgeted to increase $3.8 million. On the Base System, departmental operating expenses
are targeted amounts derived from the SBP and amounts allocated for health insurance increases
for salaried personnel, costs for material salvage, an increase in LRV spare parts, wages and
salary adjustments, and other miscellaneous increases unknown at the time of the SBP. For
FasTracks Operations, the increase is generally due to full allocation from Base to FasTracks of
costs of operating the new service corridors offset by reclassification of TABOR interest expense
to FasTracks Project. The expense project carryforward to 2017 is $15.0 million for Base
System, $19.9 million for FasTracks Project, and $1.5 million for FasTracks Operations. It
should be noted that substantial reductions were made to departmental operating budgets to
align them with the SBP target, which offset unanticipated expense increases over 2016.
Diesel fuel is budgeted at the lock price of $1.69 per gallon, compared to a price of $2.23 per
gallon in the 2016 Re-Amended Budget, for year-over-year savings of approximately $5.3 million.
Compared to the budgeted price of $1.80 used in the SBP, the savings is $1.2 million. This
differential between the SBP and actual lock price is contributed to the unrestricted operating
reserve in the 2017 Budget. Gasoline is budgeted at $2.65/gallon, down from the 2016 per
gallon budget price of $3.00, for year-over-year savings of $0.6 million.
The major changes in operating expenses comparing the Recommended Budget to the posted
Requested Budget are shown in Attachment A. The majority of the changes from the Requested
Budget consist of the expense projects carry-forward.
Interest expense in 2017 is budgeted at $160.9 million on a combined basis, an increase of
$43.6 million over the 2016 Re-Amended Budget. The increase is due to the inclusion of the
TABOR interest expense of $41.0 million as part of the DTO service payment for the first time in
2017 and new interest expense for the full year from the 2016 FasTracks bond issuance. This
increase is offset by a reduction to total interest expense from the favorable benefit of bond
refinancing. Of total interest expense, $25.5 million is budgeted for Base System and $135.4
million is budgeted for FasTracks. Capitalized interest (combined) is budgeted at $33.0 million,
the majority of which will occur in FasTracks Project. Capitalized interest will be part of the
actual cash outlay for interest payments in 2017.
Principal payments on debt are estimated at $58.9 million on a combined basis, which is $2.8
million lower than the 2016 Re-Amended Budget. Base System principal payments of $48.6
million are $3.3 million lower due to scheduled amortization of COPs issued for fleet purchases
(bus and rail). FasTracks principal payments of $10.3 million are $0.5 million higher due to
refundings and scheduled principal amortization on current debt. No new debt issuances are
planned in 2017 for either the Base System or FasTracks. Both will draw from previously issued
debt to fund major capital purchases and construction in 2017.
Capital expenditures are comprised of both the capital carry-forward from 2016 (previously
approved capital) arising from timing of project completion, and new capital for 2017. The
capital carry-forward will be $864.1 million made up of $166.1 million on the Base System and
$698.0 million on FasTracks.
New capital spending of $301.0 million on a combined basis will decrease $219.0 million from
the 2016 Re-Amended Budget due mainly to project completion in FasTracks. New capital
spending for FasTracks will decrease $175.8 million to $234.4 million in 2017 due to on-going

Packet Pg. 97

11.A

project completion on the Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility, Eagle project, US36 BRT,
Northwest Rail and I-225, offset by increases to North Metro. For the Base System, new capital
spending will decrease $43.2 million to $66.6 million. Of this amount, the Base system will
spend $6.0 million more on facilities construction and maintenance (primarily Customer Care
Center relocation), $1.4 million on Park-n-Rides, and $4.1 million on systems planning (mostly
Colfax Avenue Transit Priority Project). These increases will be offset by $1.0 million less on
bus infrastructure, $49.4 million less on fleet modernization/expansion (bus and rail), $5.3 million
less in capital support projects (primarily IT support for the District). The Base System new
capital was approved as part of the Strategic Budget Plan in September 2016 and is the amount
identified for minimum “must have” projects.
New capital expenditures for 2017 and the change in new capital in the 2017 Recommended
Budget over the previous 2017 Requested Budget/Strategic Budget Plan are shown in
Attachment B. The capital carry-forward expenditures for 2017 and the change in the capital
carry-forward in the 2017 Recommended Budget over the 2016 Re-Amended Budget are shown
in Attachment C.
Notable designated fund balance changes include a minimal decrease in the Base System yearend unrestricted fund balance from the 2016 Re-Amended Budget to $2.0 million. This
projected fund balance is in agreement with the SBP target of $2.0 million after incorporating all
revenue and expense adjustments. The actual amount realized, however, may be lower (or
higher) than that projected due to lower (or higher) fare revenue and sales tax revenue in 2016
(this will become evident in the 2017 amended budget). Also on the Base System, the Boardappropriated fund is projected to increase by $7.0 million to $17.4 million, the capital
replacement fund is projected to increase by $2.7 million to $2.7 million, and an unrestricted
operating reserve is established for the first time in 2017 at $9.7 million.
The FasTracks management reserve (formerly contingency reserve) is budgeted at $15.9 million.
The FasTracks construction reserve is budgeted at $56.3 million. In FasTracks Project and
FasTracks Operations, the Board-appropriated fund, capital replacement fund, and unrestricted
fund are established at 3 months of operating expenses up from 2 months previously.
On a District-wide basis, the unrestricted fund balance is projected to increase $2.9 million from
the 2016 Re-Amended Budget to $14.3 million. The Board-appropriated fund, the capital
replacement fund, and the unrestricted operating reserve are projected to increase by $25.3
million in total. These increases are in minimum accordance with fiscal policies for each of the
District entities (Base System, FasTracks Project and FasTracks Operations) per Fund Balance
Policy below.
Cost Recovery Ratio
The 2017 Recommended Budget meets the cost recovery ratio mandated by the Colorado
General Assembly. The estimated SB 154 recovery ratio (all non-tax revenue except ADA
farebox revenues divided by all expenditures, including depreciation, except ADA expenditures
and expenditures incurred for long-term planning and development of rapid transit infrastructure)
exceeds the annual target of 30% mandated by the General Assembly.

Packet Pg. 98

11.A

Fund Balance Policy
The Fund Balance Policy for 2017 requires fund balances to consist of a Board-appropriated
fund, a capital replacement fund, the remaining unrestricted year-end fund balance for both the
Base System and FasTracks, and an additional unrestricted operating reserve currently for the
Base System. The objective is for the total of these funds excluding the capital acquisition fund
to equal approximately three months of operating expenses excluding depreciation for both Base
System and FasTracks. The 2017 budget reflects maintenance of a FasTracks management
reserve and construction reserve at levels deemed sufficient to fund adjustments to the
FasTracks construction schedule.
The total of these unrestricted fund balances for 2017 on a District-wide basis is projected at
$68.7 million, comprised of 1) the Board-appropriated fund of $29.7 million, 2) the capital
replacement fund of $15.0 million, 3) the unrestricted operating reserve of $9.7 million, and 4)
the remaining unrestricted year-end fund balance of $14.3 million. The Base System portion of
these fund balances listed for 2017 is projected to total $31.8 million.
Basis of Accounting Used in Budgeting
The accounts of the District are reported using the GAAP accrual basis of accounting with two
exceptions:





Capital outlays and payments of bond principal are treated as expenditures.
Gains and losses on disposal of property and equipment are excluded.
The non-cash portion of the long-term unfunded pension accrual is excluded.
Asset sale proceeds and debt issuance proceeds are included.

Approval To Transfer Funds And To Enter Into
Contracts With Multiple Charter Bus Providers
For Auxiliary Bus Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
approves RTD entering into master contracts with MCITP/MCTS, Ramblin Express, Denver Public
Schools, Western Transportation Services, Colorado Tour Lines (dba.Gray Line) and Ace Express to
provide auxiliary bus service and further to transfer $1,000,000 from the FasTracks Board appropriated
reserve to fund such services.
BACKGROUND
As part of RTD’s on-going contingency planning efforts, RTD recently issued a Request for Quotations
(RFQ16DH043) for charter bus services to be provided in response to RTD request for “bus bridges” as
may be required for Eagle project services (University of Colorado A-Line, B-Line or G-Line after its
opening). This solicitation was for on-call services in order to obtain vehicles and drivers to provide the
services requested by RTD. In addition, these service providers could be engaged to provide
supplemental “BroncosRide” service for weeknight games when RTD does not have adequate capacity
to meet the demand. Currently supplemental BroncosRide service is procured on a game by game basis
through the issuance of individual RFQ’s for each game.
This procurement will result in “blanket-style” or “work order” type contracts that will fund multiple
purchase orders to multiple service providers/vendors. Funds will not be “encumbered” or used until
such time as a purchase order is issued for a particular piece of work.
Six vendors responded to the RFQ and all were selected to participate. The vendors are:
 MCITP/MCTS
 Ramblin Express
 Denver Public Schools
 Western Transportation Service
 Colorado Tour Line (d.b.a . Gray Line)
 Ace Express Coaches
Because of the potential need for this service on a 24/7 basis, each contractor that provided a quote will
be awarded a Blanket Purchase Order (BPO) with a Not to Exceed amount based on the number of buses
that they have available to provide requested services.
DISCUSSION
These service providers will be used to provide auxiliary bus service (“bus bridges” etc.) for planned
delays or shutdowns on Eagle project services related to maintenance, engineering and inspection work
periods. Due to mobilization time requirements, it is not likely that these service providers will be used
to provide emergency response service for auxiliary bus services necessitated by unplanned events or
“spur of the moment” needs. Potential use for supplemental BroncosRide service would also be on a pre-

Packet Pg. 121

12.B

planned basis as is currently done. Due to mobilization time requirements, immediate response service
will continue to be provided by RTD.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The financial impact will not exceed $1,000,000 and is estimated to be less than that as we anticipate
that RTD will be reimbursed from DTP depending on the use of the auxiliary bus services. These funds
are available from the FasTracks Board appropriated reserve. Funding for supplemental BroncosRide
service is available in the approved 2016 RTD budget and is included in the 2017 Requested budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Approve the staff recommended action.
2. Don’t approve the staff recommended action. This is not recommended action as there will not
be contracts or funding in place if DTP needs to have planned or extended shutdowns related to
maintenance, engineering, and inspection work periods.

Free Rides for Members of the Military

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations & Customer Services Committee that free rides on RTD for active
duty members of the United States Military should be extended from the presently approved date of
December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017. Utilization has been minimal to date and this extension will
have minimal impact on RTD.
BACKGROUND
At the October 30, 2006 Special Board Meeting, the RTD Board of Directors approved a resolution
allowing active duty U.S. Military personnel to ride free on all RTD services through the end of 2006.
This offer has been extended annually by the Board since that time and is now valid through December
31, 2016. As a result of these actions, all active duty members of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines,
Coast Guard, National Guard, and Reserves are entitled to ride free on any RTD service including special
services such as SkyRide and BroncosRide. To be eligible to ride for free, active duty military personnel
must either be in uniform or present an active duty military ID card.
DISCUSSION
Staff recommends that the RTD Board of Directors extend this offer beyond the current expiration date
of December 31, 2016 and that the expiration date be extended by one year at this time and revisited
again next year.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The exact financial impact of this action is not known, but is expected to be minimal.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Extend free rides on RTD for active duty members of the United States Military should from the
presently approved date of December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017. This is the staff
recommendation.
2. Do not extend RTD’s program offering free rides for active duty members of the United States
Military.

c. In-state travel guidelines
5. Professional affiliations/Membership subscriptions

of policy guidelines, and provides definitive language for ease of understanding.
2. Adopt some but not all of the proposed recommendations to the BOD Expense Policy.
Amendments to the policy would be made in committee. Note** Any portion of this policy that
is stated from an approved board Action would need to be brought forward through a new board
action for approval prior to changing in this document.
3. Reject the Recommended Action and do not approve the BOD Expense Policy. This is not
recommended because we will not be compliant to IRS regulations and all errors and lack of
clarity will remain.

travel requests by these Board members to complete special projects or who have
been approved to speak on behalf of the agency can be reviewed for approval

RTD will pay for normal, customary entertainment expenses for Board members and
one guest per Board member and other approved attendees, when the event is local
and transit related. The expenses of the Board member and one guest (or other
approved attendees) will be paid from the Board member’s local expense fund and
the other approved attendees will come from the general Board office budget.
(Resolution 6 Series of 2009).
Articles 29 of the State Constitution (formerly Amendment 41) pertaining to ethics in
government has still not been resolved in Colorado. The recommendation from our
legal counsel is for Board Directors to refrain from accepting anything of value from
other than personal friends and family from the time of certification of the election until
such time as an opinion is rendered or refused. If you are invited to a dinner or meal
where the expected value exceeds $50.00, please offer to pay for your own meal.
Please bring us the receipt and we will be happy to reimburse you for these expenses.

2.0.

Reimbursable Expenses

To protect the interest of the District and to provide guidelines for the Directors to
follow, the following provisions govern expense allowances for out of town and
local business related expenses within established budget limits. Only business
expenses may be claimed. The purchase of alcohol is not reimbursable and should
not be reflected on submitted receipts.
Ordinary and necessary RTD business related expenses may be reimbursed with
proper receipts provided they itemized receipt will shows time, date, and business
purpose and includes the name(s) and title(s) of any qualifying attendee. An
ordinary expense is one that is common and accepted in one’s field of trade,
business or profession. Board members are asked to exercise sound judgment in
the incurring and submittal of such expenses, keeping within the standards and
proprieties of an agency supported by public tax money. Examples of ordinary and
necessary local expenses include mileage reimbursement, conference or seminar
registration fees, parking, business meeting expenses, and attendance at transit
related or community events that are considered a necessary part of conducting
District business.
Political meetings partisan conferences or political group
activities will not be covered as an RTD Expense.
Meals and entertainment expenses need to be supported by a list of attendees and
the business purpose of the events along with an itemized receipt. If meetings
between Directors, employees and/or business contacts take place outside of the
District office, the meal costs will be equally divided among the Board members

approved by the Board Chair. Reimbursement for travel expenses in a host city is
allowed one day before the start of a conference or one day following a conference
where travel scheduling provisions or same day flight times are not available or
convenient. An example, a Director would need to leave Denver on Saturday to
arrive in time for a conference with a start day of Sunday in Washington D.C., and
no flights are available to get them there in time for the Sunday meeting start time.
Directors are responsible for any portion of ticket costs resulting from personal side
trips (including hotel, food, ground transportation and parking). Airfare is calculated
on a pro- rated basis, but under no circumstance is RTD’s expense to exceed the
(economy class) direct route pricing.
If the RTD air travel is a portion of another planned flight that has been arranged
directly by the Board Member, a copy of the itinerary and ticket claiming
reimbursement must be provided to the Board Office at the time of booking and
with the expense report form.

available flight cost to and from the destination. If use of a personal vehicle is
requested, the Director will be allowed mileage reimbursement up to the maximum
allowable under the Internal Revenue Service guidelines, but not to exceed the cost
of air travel to the destination. The cost of the air travel is to be determined by the
Board office staff prior to the date of travel to determine the amount that may be
reimbursed for mileage. The determination is established by example of other
Director’s airfare for the same trip or by research of the lowest fares. All
supporting documentation will be submitted by the Board office staff along with
your expense form.
In the rare instance where a personal vehicle is used on a trip, mileage
reimbursement and parking/storage costs will not exceed the equivalent discount
airfare between the points involved. Discount fares and “could have” departure

by the Board Office using a P-Card. In the event these fees are not pre-paid, a
copy of the official hotel bill must be provided with the expense report when

Hotels require a personal credit card for the person staying at the hotel for
incidentals. The RTDcompany P-Ccard only covers room and tax, so upon check
in, the Bboard member will need to provide the front desk with their own personal
credit card for miscellaneous expenses. When checking out, please make sure your
personal credit card was not charged for room and tax.
Note* If you utilize a debit or bank card to cover miscellaneous expenses, a hold
may be put on your card in a set amount for the duration of the stay.
The District will reimburse Directors the actual cost of lodging which include room
charges and taxes. All charges other than room charges or taxes appearing on the
hotel bill will be reimbursable subject to the limits established and the submittal of
the itemized receipt. Directors are expected to use sound judgment in the selection
of lodging in keeping with the purpose of the travel so as to minimize the cost to
the District. Lodging or hotel accommodations which were billed to a P-Ccard will
require itemized receipts to match to the actual incurred amount.
When a Director is accompanied by another individual, the District is to be billed
only for the single rate for lodging. The Director must pay for the difference
between single and double rate for the room, if applicable.

4.3. Meals
Directors will be reimbursed for daily personal meals and gratuities with the
submittal of an itemized receipt and documentation that identifies the time, place
and business purpose.
Reimbursement for travel expenses, including meals and gratuities, is allowed on
the first day preceding one day before the start of a conference or one day the last
day following a conference where travel scheduling provisions or same day flight
times are not available or convenient. An example, of this is where a Director
would need to leave Denver on a Saturdayunday to arrive in time for a conference
with a start day of Sunday in Washington D.C., and no flights are available to get
themhim there in time for the Sunday meeting start. Directors will not be
reimbursed for any day that they may choose to go early or stay late for personal
reasons. Directors must provide itemized receipts that provide the time, place and
purpose for the reimbursement request for incurred travel related expenses.
When attending an RTD paid event or conference where meals are provided,
Directors are expected to reduce the number of reimbursed requests for meals by
the number of meals that are provided at the conference. However, if the Director
elects not to eat at the conference or to have a business meetingconference with
meals outside of the paid event, the Director will be reimbursed assuming he can
provide itemized receipts and documentation of the RTD Transit related purpose,

their transportation or technologyprofession, cultivating networks with other
professionals, and developing skills and ideas to become more effective in
theirhis/her position policy making at RTD. Any memberships that are of an
extraordinary cost or require approval will go before the Executive Committee for
approval.
Membership subscriptions in local chambers or approved organizations are
processed through the RTD Public Relations Office. per Management Directive A20. Directors should submit their membership requests through the Board office
who will track and coordinate with the RTD staff responsible for payment.
Organizations must meet the criteria of being transit-related and/or necessary to the
conduct of business and local community involvement. Membership requests that
do not fit this criterion must be approved through the General Manager’s budget.
The Board policy on Organizational Memberships was passed in August of 2011.

For budgeted events only, such as the Board Member/Board Support conference
hosted by the RTD BOD in 2015, the budget document listing allocations for
specific events will serve as the official authorization for the Chair to approve. For
out of state budgeted events only, the “RTD Travel Request and Authorization”
form and the expense report will need to be signed by the Chair of the Board.may
be signed by the Executive Manager to the Board of Directors.

budget, approval must be obtained from the Board. The approval of the Chair is
also required for substitutions for authorized events. A memo explaining reasons
for the request must accompany the travel request form.

government has still not been resolved in Colorado. The recommendation from our
legal counsel is for Board Directors to refrain from accepting anything of value from
other than personal friends and family from the time of certification of the election until
such time as an opinion is rendered or refused. If you are invited to a dinner or meal
where the expected value exceeds $50.00, please offer to pay for your own meal.
Please bring us the receipt and we will be happy to reimburse you for these expenses.

allowable under the Internal Revenue Service guidelines, but not to exceed the cost
of air travel to the destination. The cost of the air travel is to be determined by the
Board office staff prior to the date of travel to determine the amount that may be
reimbursed for mileage. The determination is established by example of other
Director’s airfare for the same trip or by research of the lowest fares. All
supporting documentation will be submitted by the Board office staff along with
your expense form.
In the rare instance where a personal vehicle is used on a trip, mileage

Hotels require a personal credit card for the person staying at the hotel for
incidentals. The RTDcompany P-Ccard only covers room and tax, so upon check
in, the Bboard member will need to provide the front desk with their own personal
credit card for miscellaneous expenses. When checking out, please make sure your
personal credit card was not charged for room and tax.
Note* If you utilize a debit or bank card to cover miscellaneous expenses, a hold
may be put on your card in a set amount for the duration of the stay.
The District will reimburse Directors the actual cost of lodging which include room
charges and taxes. All charges other than room charges or taxes appearing on the
hotel bill will be reimbursable subject to the limits established and the submittal of
the itemized receipt. Directors are expected to use sound judgment in the selection
of lodging in keeping with the purpose of the travel so as to minimize the cost to
the District. Lodging or hotel accommodations which were billed to a P-Ccard will
require itemized receipts to match to the actual incurred amount.
When a Director is accompanied by another individual, the District is to be billed
only for the single rate for lodging. The Director must pay for the difference
between single and double rate for the room, if applicable.

4.3. Meals
Directors will be reimbursed for daily personal meals and gratuities with the
submittal of an itemized receipt and documentation that identifies the time, place
and business purpose.
Reimbursement for travel expenses, including meals and gratuities, is allowed on
the first day preceding one day before the start of a conference or one day the last
day following a conference where travel scheduling provisions or same day flight
times are not available or convenient. An example, of this is where a Director
would need to leave Denver on a Saturdayunday to arrive in time for a conference
with a start day of Sunday in Washington D.C., and no flights are available to get
themhim there in time for the Sunday meeting start. Directors will not be
reimbursed for any day that they may choose to go early or stay late for personal
reasons. Directors must provide itemized receipts that provide the time, place and
purpose for the reimbursement request for incurred travel related expenses.
When attending an RTD paid event or conference where meals are provided,
Directors are expected to reduce the number of reimbursed requests for meals by
the number of meals that are provided at the conference. However, if the Director
elects not to eat at the conference or to have a business meetingconference with
meals outside of the paid event, the Director will be reimbursed assuming he can
provide itemized receipts and documentation of the RTD Transit related purpose,

Professional Affiliations/Membership Subscriptions

The Regional Transportation District encourages development of Directors through
active membership in professional organizations.
Although membership in
professional affiliations can be an indirect benefit to RTD as an organization, the
main benefit is the development of the Director, by keeping abreast of trends in
their transportation or technologyprofession, cultivating networks with other
professionals, and developing skills and ideas to become more effective in
theirhis/her position policy making at RTD. Any memberships that are of an
extraordinary cost or require approval will go before the Executive Committee for
approval.
Membership subscriptions in local chambers or approved organizations are
processed through the RTD Public Relations Office. per Management Directive A20. Directors should submit their membership requests through the Board office
who will track and coordinate with the RTD staff responsible for payment.
Organizations must meet the criteria of being transit-related and/or necessary to the
conduct of business and local community involvement. Membership requests that
do not fit this criterion must be approved through the General Manager’s budget.
The Board policy on Organizational Memberships was passed in August of 2011.

For budgeted events only, such as the Board Member/Board Support conference
hosted by the RTD BOD in 2015, the budget document listing allocations for
specific events will serve as the official authorization for the Chair to approve. For
out of state budgeted events only, the “RTD Travel Request and Authorization”
form and the expense report will need to be signed by the Chair of the Board.may
be signed by the Executive Manager to the Board of Directors.
.
Unless there is clearly an apparent benefit to the District, unbudgeted events will
not be approved. If funds for any events have not been approved in the annual
budget, approval must be obtained from the Board. The approval of the Chair is
also required for substitutions for authorized events. A memo explaining reasons
for the request must accompany the travel request form.

RTD with approval of the benefit to the agency. Such events are essential in
getting the community involved in the mission and vision of RTD. At times the
General Manager or RTD outreach departments will purchase a table at community

other approved events are paid for out of the Director’s local expense budget.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

Date: November 10, 2016

From:

Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

November 9, 2016

Board Meeting Date: November 29, 2016

Subject:

Amended Annual Audit Plan 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approves the attached Amended Annual Audit Plan for 2016.
BACKGROUND
The General Manager’s Goals have historically included the completion of 20 Audits which have been
included in the Annual Audit Plan and reflected in the Performance Measures. Audit has been staffed by
two employees for many years – a manager and a Senior Auditor. The level of staffing has not kept
pace with the work load or complexity of the audits. Information Technology (IT) Audits were
introduced to RTD in 2015 and are an integral part of the Audit function. IT Auditing is not a
temporary part of the Annual Audit Plan; it is a necessary part of the Audit function for all
organizations including RTD. IT Audits are larger, more complex and very detailed requiring more
time and knowledge of worldwide technical standards.
The Approved Annual Audit Plan for 2016 includes 20 audits. The plan was produced based on the
expectation that the Audit staff would be increased to accommodate the work load and capacity
associated with IT Audits. RTD has grown significantly in the past few years but the size of the Audit
team has not grown proportionately. No additional staffing was approved in the 2016 amended budget
or the 2017 budget.
DISCUSSION
Audit is very concerned about the large number of audits (20) and the quality of those audits if that
number continues to stay the same in future years. Twenty audits put
pressure on Audit to
compromise the comprehensiveness of the audit process.
We feel the quality of Audit work has improved drastically since the middle of 2013. Audits have been
selected for the Annual Audit Plan according to their potential to improve RTD’s policies and procedures
and contribute to the achievement of RTD’s Goals and Objectives. This has resulted in Audit taking on
more complex and detailed audit work, ensuring the complete Audit process has been utilized in every
case, which means that several of the audits required a much longer time resource investment than
originally planned.
In the past, in order to complete 20 audits, the following has been done:
Limiting the Audit scope
Using very small sample sizes
Limited substantive testing
Incomplete Audit Files and
Selecting less complex audits to include in the Annual Audit Plan.
In addition, the current Annual Audit Plan reduces flexibility. There is very limited time for the review
of audits completed by the Senior Auditor and no time for projects that may arise during the year

Packet Pg. 163

12.E

which require immediate attention. Follow-up Audit work, which would ensure that the agreed upon
recommendations are being complied with and the policies and procedures are being applied as
prescribed, has not been completed due to time constraints. There is also insufficient time for
continuing professional development training which is imperative to keep up with the latest in
Governmental Auditing Standards and industry best practices.
The complexity, types of audit, and additional issues that arise during the course of the audit
process have required more attention and time than originally anticipated. In addition, as was
mentioned previously, additional resources were not forthcoming.
The quality of the audit work and the improvements brought about by the recommendations, made
by Audit to improve the systems, policies and procedures, should be the focus as opposed to the
number of Audits. It is not beneficial to continue to include 20 audits in the Annual Audit Plan when
it is impossible to complete 20 audits of good quality and of sufficient value to the organization in
any one year, with the current limited staff resources.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no current financial impact; however, going forward consideration woul d have to be given
to additional staff to address the future workload of RTD Audit.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit
Committee that the Board of Directors approves the attached Amended Annual Audit Plan for
2016.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not Adopt the Amended Annual Audit Plan for
2016. This action is not recommended. Internal Auditing is an independent, objective assurance
and consulting activity designed to add value and improve an organization's operations. It is
impossible to complete the original Audit plan without additional staff or outside services.

Proposed 2017 Fiscal Policy Statement

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: November 10, 2016
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: November 29, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approves and adopts the 2017 Fiscal Policy Statement.
BACKGROUND
Proposed modifications to the Fiscal Policy Statement (the “Policy”) are brought to the Board of
Directors for approval during the year, as necessary. In addition, each year staff presents the
proposed Policy for the upcoming fiscal year for approval to the Board of Directors as an initial step
in development of the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) and Recommended Budget.
The most recent modification to the Policy was approved by the Board of Directors in November
2015 for the 2016 fiscal year. Those changes primarily related to: 1) review of potential fare
adjustments to establish a fare structure to ensure that it is understandable, implementable,
equitable, and achieves revenue levels in the SBP; 2) contracting with a qualified third party to
provide sales and use tax forecasting; 3) an investment in safety outreach programs and personnel;
and 4) other miscellaneous clarifications. The Policy Statement was also updated with the most
recent rating agency credit ratings at the time.

DISCUSSION
For 2017, the following major changes are proposed.
Fund Balance Policies #1 is revised as follows: The Base System should strive to maintain a total
fund balance at an amount approximately equal to three months of Base System operating expenses
excluding depreciation among the following three reserve funds: the Board-appropriated fund, the
unrestricted operating reserve, and the remaining unrestricted fund balance. For FasTracks, the total
of the Board-appropriated fund and unrestricted fund balance should be maintained at an amount
approximately equal to three months of FasTracks operating expenses excluding depreciation.
Fund Balance Policies #4 is revised as follows: In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will
designate an unrestricted operating reserve on an annual basis. Use of the fund balance will be to
mitigate service or project disruptions due to revenue fluctuations, unanticipated expenditures of a
nonrecurring nature, or to avoid cash flow disruptions. The source of replenishment of this fund will
be identified and replenishment will take place in a prompt manner.
Fund Balance Policies #6 is updated to reflect only one FasTracks reserve for future construction
remaining under the FasTracks plan and that is the FasTracks Management Reserve.

Packet Pg. 185

12.F

Fund Balance Policies #7 is revised as follows: The FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) will
be used to provide funding to complete and operate additional FasTracks projects. Expenditures from
the FISA will be subject to Board approval.
Debt Policies #5 is updated with the most recent rating agency credit ratings in effect at this date.
All other proposed changes to the Policy Statement are primarily wording clarification and are
reflected in the attachment.
Please see the attachments for the full proposed document and document with changes indicated.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Adopting the Fiscal Policy Statement as requested will not have a financial impact on the 2017
Recommended Budget.

ALTERNATIVES
1. Approve the recommended changes to RTD’s 2017 Fiscal Policy Statement. Staff supports
this alternative because the Policy Statement documents the policies to be adhered to in 2017
and provides clarification of certain practices.
2. Board further modifies the recommended changes. Staff reviewed the fiscal policies and
welcomes any suggestions for modifications requested by the Board of Directors.
3. Do not adopt the RTD 2017 Fiscal Policy Statement. This is not recommended because
RTD’s Fiscal Policy Statement would not contain all current language, would not adhere to
best practices, and would not best facilitate the needs of RTD’s financial operations.

REVENUE POLICIES
1. Staff will plan fare adjustments every 3three years in the mid and long-term
budgets to adjust for inflation. The Board of Directors may consider potential fare
adjustments annually at the time of the development of the Strategic Budget Plan
(SBP). As part of this process, staff will review potential fare adjustments to
establish a fare structure to ensure that it:
 is understandable
 is implementable
 is equitable
 achieves revenue levels established in the Strategic Budget PlanSBP, and
 facilitates the integration of the 2016 rail and BRT projects.
2. Fare policies will take into account the special needs of all transit dependent
patrons.
3. RTD will avoid dependence on temporary revenues to fund ongoing services. Onetime revenues will be used for one-time expenditures.
4. RTD will continuously explore additional sources of revenue to help balance the
budget.
5. When appropriate the Board will actively pursue legislation that would help ensure
the continued accomplishment of RTD’s goals and mission statement. The Board
will support efforts to ensure that legislative intent is realized in allocation of state
financial resources to public transit. The Board will actively oppose legislation that
would limit or diminish revenue.
6. On an annual basis, staff will identify under- or un-utilized property and equipment,
and will make an ongoing attempt to sell such property and equipment to enhance
cash flow.

1. On an annual basis, RTD will prepare and update a six-year Strategic Budget Plan
(SBP) including projected capital construction and improvements, service levels,
operating costs, and revenues to fund the capital and operating programs. Capital
projects to be included in the SBP will be evaluated using the following criteria:

funding; and
 RTD mission statement elements, Board strategic goals, and other relevant
criteria.
2. Priority will be given to replacement of existing assets before consideration of new
assets except as allowed for in the FasTracks financial plan (see #7 below).
3. RTD will use the first year capital program from the adopted SBP as the basis for
the capital program to be included in the annual budget.
4. After completion of design of a capital project, cost estimates will be revised. If
the cost estimates exceed Delegation of Authority limits, the project will be
brought to the Board for reconsideration.
5. Facilities will be designed using current technology and allow for future
technological changes in order to be efficient and cost-effective and to protect the
public welfare.
6. RTD shall allow for multi-year capital projects to be carried forward in accordance
with the carry-forward resolution adopted by the Board.
7. RTD will prepare an annual update of the FasTracks Annual Program Evaluation

Fiscal Policy Statement - effective November 29, 20165

1. RTD will strive to maintain a fund balance in the Base System and in the FasTracks
operating budget, to provide for unanticipated expenditures of a nonrecurring
nature, to meet unexpected increases in costs or to mitigate service disruptions as
a result of economic downturns affecting revenue. The Base System should strive
to maintain a total fund balance at an amount approximately equal to three months
of Base System operating expenses excluding depreciation among the following
three reserve funds: the Board-appropriated fund, the unrestricted operating
reserve, and the remaining unrestricted fund balance. This unrestricted fund
balance will be comprised of a Board appropriated fund, a capital replacement fund
and an undesignated working capital fund as described below. For the Base
System, the total of these three funds should be maintained at an amount
approximately equal to three months of Base System operating expenses excluding
depreciation.
For FasTracks, the total of the Board-appropriated fund and
unrestricted fund balance total of these three funds should be maintained at an
amount approximately equal to twothree months of FasTracks operating expenses
excluding depreciation. RTD will consider and pursue resources that will be
directed to fund balance replenishment. For example, non-recurring revenues and
budget surpluses are an especially appropriate source for replenishing fund balance.
RTD will replenish fund balances as soon as economic conditions allow.
2. In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will designate a Board- appropriated
fund balance on an annual basis. Use of the fund balance will be minimized and
occur only in specific circumstances such as economic downturns. With Board
approval, these funds may be used to avoid cash flow interruptions, reduce the
need for short-term borrowing, and assist in maintaining an investment-grade bond
rating.
The source of replenishment of this fund will be identified and
replenishment will take place in a prompt manner.
3. In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will designate a capital replacement
fund on an annual basis. With Board approval, these funds will be used for
scheduled major vehicle replacements and other capital purchases. The source of
replenishment of this fund will be identified and replenishment will take place in a
prompt manner.
4. In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will designate an unrestricted
operating reserve on an annual basis. Use of the fund balance will be to mitigate
service or project disruptions due to revenue fluctuations, unanticipated
expenditures of a nonrecurring nature, or to avoid cash flow disruptions. The
source of replenishment of this fund will be identified and replenishment will take
place in a prompt manner. RTD will designate excess and undesignated working

FasTracks plan:
 The FasTracks Contingency Management Reserve will be appropriated at a
sufficient level each year to fund adjustments to the FasTracks construction

the annual budget is adopted, and will not be used to fund the (non-FasTracks)
Base System capital or operating activity.
7. The FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) will be used to provide funding for
future FasTracks projects that are currently unfunded to complete and operate
additional FasTracks projects. Expenditures from the FISA will be subject to Board

Matrix (RAM). Funding of the FISA will be provided from the sources identified in
the Board approved Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM) and other sources approved by
the Board.
8. All other FasTracks funds which have not been appropriated, or otherwise
designated as reserved, in the current budget year will be maintained in a reserve
for future FasTracks capital and operating expenditures and will not be used to

Fiscal Policy Statement - effective November 29, 2016

1. On an annual basis, RTD will prepare and update a six-year Strategic Budget Plan
(SBP) including projected capital construction and improvements, service levels,
operating costs, and revenues to fund the capital and operating programs. Capital
projects to be included in the SBP will be evaluated using the following criteria:
 total project cost (design and construction) and schedule for completion;
 source of funding;
 operating and maintenance costs for the remainder of the SBP period;
 benefits and contributions to RTD and the community, including but not limited
to the effect on future operating and maintenance costs, economy, service, and
ridership;
 consideration of alternatives (joint development, etc.); consequences of not
funding; and
 RTD mission statement elements, Board strategic goals, and other relevant
criteria.
2. Priority will be given to replacement of existing assets before consideration of new
assets except as allowed for in the FasTracks financial plan (see #7 below).
3. RTD will use the first year capital program from the adopted SBP as the basis for
the capital program to be included in the annual budget.
4. After completion of design of a capital project, cost estimates will be revised. If
the cost estimates exceed Delegation of Authority limits, the project will be
brought to the Board for reconsideration.
5. Facilities will be designed using current technology and allow for future
technological changes in order to be efficient and cost-effective and to protect the
public welfare.
6. RTD shall allow for multi-year capital projects to be carried forward in accordance
with the carry-forward resolution adopted by the Board.
7. RTD will prepare an annual update of the FasTracks Annual Program Evaluation
(APE) which will be integrated with the SBP incorporating the actual costs incurred
and the most recent available projections of capital improvement costs, service
levels, and operating costs and revenues to fund the FasTracks capital and
operating programs.

Fiscal Policy Statement - effective November 29, 2016

1. RTD will strive to maintain a fund balance in the Base System and FasTracks to
provide for unanticipated expenditures of a nonrecurring nature, to meet
unexpected increases in costs or to mitigate service disruptions as a result of
economic downturns affecting revenue.
The Base System should strive to
maintain a total fund balance at an amount approximately equal to three months of
Base System operating expenses excluding depreciation among the following three
reserve funds: the Board-appropriated fund, the unrestricted operating reserve,
and the remaining unrestricted fund balance. For FasTracks, the total of the Boardappropriated fund and unrestricted fund balance should be maintained at an
amount approximately equal to three months of FasTracks operating expenses
excluding depreciation. RTD will consider and pursue resources that will be
directed to fund balance replenishment. For example, non-recurring revenues and
budget surpluses are an especially appropriate source for replenishing fund balance.
RTD will replenish fund balances as soon as economic conditions allow.
2. In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will designate a Board-appropriated
fund balance on an annual basis. Use of the fund balance will be minimized and
occur only in specific circumstances such as economic downturns. With Board
approval, these funds may be used to avoid cash flow interruptions, reduce the
need for short-term borrowing, and assist in maintaining an investment-grade bond
rating.
The source of replenishment of this fund will be identified and
replenishment will take place in a prompt manner.
3. In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will designate a capital replacement
fund on an annual basis. With Board approval, these funds will be used for
scheduled major vehicle replacements and other capital purchases. The source of
replenishment of this fund will be identified and replenishment will take place in a
prompt manner.
4. In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will designate an unrestricted
operating reserve on an annual basis. Use of the fund balance will be to mitigate
service or project disruptions due to revenue fluctuations, unanticipated
expenditures of a nonrecurring nature, or to avoid cash flow disruptions. The
source of replenishment of this fund will be identified and replenishment will take
place in a prompt manner.

5. RTD will maintain an emergency (TABOR) reserve equal to three percent of nonFederal revenues, as specified by Article X, Section 20 of the Colorado
Constitution.

6. The Board shall establish a reserve for future construction under the FasTracks
plan:
 The FasTracks Management Reserve will be appropriated at a sufficient level
each year to fund adjustments to the FasTracks construction schedule, relating
to logistics or cost savings opportunities that might arise after the annual
budget is adopted, and will not be used to fund the (non-FasTracks) Base
System capital or operating activity.
7. The FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) will be used to provide funding to
complete and operate additional FasTracks projects. Expenditures from the FISA
will be subject to Board approval. Funding of the FISA will be provided from the
sources identified in the Board approved Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM) and other
sources approved by the Board.
8. All other FasTracks funds which have not been appropriated, or otherwise
designated as reserved, in the current budget year will be maintained in a reserve
for future FasTracks capital and operating expenditures and will not be used to
fund the (non-FasTracks) Base System expenditures.

DEBT POLICIES
1. Debt financing will not be issued to support operating expenditures.
2. Capital projects funded through the issuance of bonds, Certificates of Participation
(COPs) or other financial obligations shall be financed for a period not to exceed
the lesser of the expected useful life of the asset or a maximum of 40 years.
3. Effective communication with credit rating agencies will be maintained, and a
policy of full disclosure on every financial report and official statement will be
followed.
4. Before long-term debt is issued, the impact of debt service on total annual
expenditures and the net revenue coverage ratio will be analyzed.
5. It is the intent of RTD to maintain a high quality investment-grade credit rating. The
benefit of maintaining RTD's credit ratings at the highest reasonably attainable
level in light of current economic conditions and availability of capital funding is to
receive lower interest rates and lower debt insurance premiums than would be
possible with lower credit ratings. RTD’s current ratings are listed below:

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

From:

Heather McKillop,
Administration

Date:

November 9, 2016

Subject:

Authorization of RTD Investment Policy

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: November 10, 2016
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: November 29, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
adopt the Investment Policy Statement (the “Policy”), attached.
BACKGROUND:
The Policy specifies the practices and procedures that pertain to the investment of RTD’s operating and
reserve funds. The Board last approved modifications to the Policy in September 2015. Section 10 of
the Policy states “The CFO shall conduct a review of the Policy on an annual basis and present the
policy, denoting any changes, to the Board of Directors for approval.”
DISCUSSION:
Staff solicited the expertise, knowledge and recommendations of its investment advisor, Public Trust
Advisors, in reviewing the current Policy. Minor changes are recommended this year for clarification
sake and in response to the recent SEC Money Market Reform.
The purpose of the Investment Policy (the “Policy”) of the Regional Transportation District ("RTD") is to
specify the policies and procedures that support a prudent and systematic program for investments in
RTD’s operating and reserve funds. The Policy also provides for the investment of bond proceeds that
are authorized through bond resolutions or indentures of trust.
By following best practices with respect to the management of public funds, the primary objectives of
RTD’s Investment Policy in order of priority are: 1) safety of principal, 2) sufficient liquidity to meet
known cash flow requirements, and 3) yield (achieving a market rate of return). Although RTD must
legally follow the investment parameters dictated by Colorado Revised Statutes (C.R.S. 24-75-601.1) it
has previously made a policy decision to implement its investment program in a more conservative
manner than is dictated by state statute through imposing stricter diversification limits.
On October 14th, 2016 the Securities and Exchange Commission enacted amendments to the rules that
govern money market mutual funds. The amendments make structural and operational reforms to
address risks of investor runs in money market funds, while preserving the benefits of the funds.
The new rules require a floating net asset value (NAV) for institutional prime money market funds, which
allows the daily share prices of these funds to fluctuate along with changes in the market-based value of
fund assets and provide non-government money market fund boards new tools – liquidity fees and
redemption gates – to address runs.
Colorado State Statute does not allow State or local governments to invest in money market funds with
a floating net asset value. RTD is and has been compliant with this requirement and has not been
investing in institutional prime money market funds since the reform was enacted.

FINANCIAL IMPACT:
The Policy presents no negative financial impacts to RTD.

1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this document is to specify the policies and procedures that support a prudent and
systematic program for investment transactions involving operating and reserve funds of the
Regional Transportation District ("RTD").
2. SCOPE
This investment policy ("Policy") applies to investment of all operating and reserve funds of the
RTD (collectively, the “Portfolio").
This Policy shall not restrict the ability of RTD to invest proceeds from the issuance of RTD
securities in financial obligations permitted through board-approved bond resolutions or
indentures of trust pursuant to which the securities were issued. The standards of care dictated
for investments of other RTD funds shall also pertain to the investment of such proceeds.
3. OBJECTIVES
The objectives, in priority order, of the RTD's investment activities shall be:
3.1 Safety
Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the investment program. Investments of RTD
will be made in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the Portfolio. To
attain this objective, RTD will endeavor to mitigate credit and interest rate risks.
Credit Risk: RTD will minimize credit risk, which is the risk of loss due to the failure of the
security issuer or backer, by:



Limiting investments to the types of securities listed in the Authorized Investments
section of this Policy.
Diversifying the Portfolio in accordance with Policy limits in order to minimize the
potential for losses from any one type of security or any one individual issuer.

Interest Rate Risk: RTD will minimize interest rate risk, which is the risk that the market
value of securities in the Portfolio will fall due to changes in market interest rates, by:


Maintaining Portfolio duration appropriate to the cash flow requirements of RTD,
thereby reducing the likelihood that securities would need to be sold on the open
market prior to maturity.

Packet Pg. 209

12.G.a

The Portfolio will remain sufficiently liquid to enable RTD to meet all cash flow requirements
which might be reasonably anticipated. This will be achieved through maturity diversification
and purchases of securities that have an established secondary market.
3.3 Yield
The Portfolio shall be designed with the objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout
budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account the investment risk constraints, liquidity
needs, and cash flow characteristics of the Portfolio.
4. STANDARDS OF CARE
4.1 Prudence
All RTD officers and employees involved in the investment of RTD funds, along with any
external investment advisors, shall adhere to the guidance provided by the “prudent investor”
standard to insure that:
“When investing, reinvesting, purchasing, acquiring, exchanging, selling, or managing
public funds, a trustee shall act with care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the
circumstances then prevailing, including, but not limited to, the general economic
conditions and the anticipated needs of the agency, that a prudent person acting in a like
capacity and familiar with those matters would use in the conduct of funds of a like
character and with like aims, to safeguard the principal and maintain the liquidity needs
of the agency. Within the limitations of this section and considering individual
investments as part of an overall strategy, investments may be acquired as authorized by
law."
RTD shall recognize that no investment is totally riskless and that the investment activities of
RTD are a matter of public record. Accordingly, it recognizes that occasional measured losses
are inevitable in a diversified portfolio and shall be considered within the context of the overall
Portfolio’s return, provided that adequate diversification has been implemented, and that the sale
of a security is in the best long-term interest of RTD.
Authorized investment personnel acting in accordance with this Policy and exercising due
diligence shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security’s credit risk or
market price changes, provided that deviations from expectation are reported in a timely fashion
and appropriate action is taken to control adverse developments.
4.2 Delegation of Authority
RTD is granted legislative authority to invest its funds pursuant to Colorado Revised Statutes,
Section 32-9-119. Management responsibility for the investment program is hereby delegated to

Attachment: Recommended Investment Policy Red Line 9-21-16 (2016-019 : Authorization of RTD Investment Policy)

3.2 Liquidity

Packet Pg. 210

12.G.a

RTD may, in its discretion, contract with one or more investment advisers, registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, to manage a
portion of its Portfolio assets. Any such advisor shall comply with this Policy and such other
written instructions as provided by RTD.
While it is understood that the procedures and trading counterparties of a contracted investment
adviser may differ from those of RTD, contracted investment advisers must maintain internal
controls and compliance systems at least as extensive as those of the RTD in order to assure
adequate protection of RTD assets in keeping with the standards of prudence outlined below.
4.3 Investment Procedures
The CFO shall establish written procedures for the operation of the investment program,
consistent with this Policy, which shall include explicit delegation of authority to persons
responsible for investment transactions. No person may engage in an investment transaction
except as provided under the terms of this Policy and the internal procedures established by the
CFO. Persons who are authorized to transact investment business and wire funds on behalf of
RTD are listed in Appendix 1 to this policy.
4.4 Internal Controls
The CFO shall establish a system of internal controls, which shall be reviewed annually. The
controls shall be designed to prevent loss of funds due to fraud, employee error,
misrepresentation by third parties, or imprudent actions by employees of RTD.
4.5 Ethics and Conflicts of Interest
Investment activities shall be performed in accordance with RTD’s Code of Ethics and other
policies of RTD. Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from
personal business activity that could conflict with the proper execution of the investment
program, or which could impair their ability to make impartial investment decisions. Employees
and investment officials shall disclose to the General Manager any material financial interests in
financial institutions that conduct business with RTD, and they shall further disclose any large
personal/financial/investment positions that could be related to the performance of the Portfolio.
Employees and officers shall subordinate their personal investment transactions to those of RTD
particularly with regard to the timing of purchases or sales.
5. AUTHORIZED INVESTMENTS
Authorized investments for RTD funds are specifically listed below. RTD recognizes that
investment risk can result from issuer defaults, market price changes or various technical
impediments leading to diminished liquidity or loss of capital. Portfolio risk management and
diversification are employed as a way to minimize the risks inherent in investing.

and Fitch, and Aa1, Aa2 and Aa3 for Moody's Investors Service. In the event that an issuer or
security is downgraded below the minimum rating level for any specific security that is held in
the Portfolio, the CFO will review the exposure of that security holding and will determine if it is
advisable to sell such holding.

6. INVESTMENT PARAMETERS

RTD does not make investments for the purpose of trading or speculation, but, rather, with the
prevalent intent to hold securities to maturity. The prohibition of speculative investment
precludes pursuit of profit through unusual risk or conjectural fluctuations in market prices.
However, fluctuations in market rates or changes in credit quality may produce situations where
securities may be sold at a nominal loss in order to mitigate further erosion of principal or to
reinvest proceeds of sale in securities that will out-perform the original investment.
6.2 Competitive Bidding
A record shall be maintained of all bids and offers for securities transactions to support RTD’s
competitive pricing process. Relative offerings shall not be required in the purchase of
obligations at their initial auction or offering. Typically, awards will be made to the bidder
offering the highest effective yield consistent with the Policy: however, transaction costs,
diversification requirements, extraordinary events and other factors may be considered when
awarding investments.
6.3 Portfolio Duration
The maturity of the securities in the Portfolio shall be managed with respect to the cash flow
needs of RTD and the Portfolio shall be managed to maintain a duration of three years or less.
6.4 Authorized Financial Dealers and Institutions
RTD or an investment advisor hired by RTD will maintain a list of financial institutions
authorized to provide investment services and it shall be the policy of RTD to purchase securities
only from those authorized institutions and firms. Trading counterparties shall be limited to (i)
primary dealers reporting to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, or (ii) broker/dealers that
qualify under Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15c3-1 (uniform net capital rule).
6.5 Authorized Investment Advisors
RTD may engage the services of one or more professional investment advisory firms to assist in
the management of the Portfolio. Such investment advisors may be granted discretion to
purchase and sell investment securities in accordance with this Policy and may utilize their own
approved list of broker/dealers. Such firms must be authorized to conduct business in the State
of Colorado and shall be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

7. SAFEKEEPING AND CUSTODY

With the exception of collateral under repurchase agreements (discussed below), all investment
securities purchased shall be held in a safekeeping account or trust custody account at a
designated third party custodian. For safekeeping accounts, the institution shall issue a
safekeeping receipt for each security, listing the specific instrument, par value, rate, CUSIP and
any other pertinent information. In addition, the safekeeping or trust custody institutions shall
provide a statement on at least a monthly basis listing all securities held in account, including
book value and market value of holdings at month-end.
For collateral (purchased securities) under repurchase agreements, RTD may utilize tri-party
repurchase agreements with an acceptable third-party custodian provided that RTD is satisfied
that it has perfected interest in the securities used as collateral, and that RTD has a properly
executed tri-party agreement.
7.2 Delivery vs. Payment
All investment transactions will be executed on a delivery versus payment basis.
8. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
Investment reports shall be prepared on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis. Transaction
summaries shall be maintained and available in the office of the CFO or other authorized
investment personnel. Quarterly investment reports shall be submitted to the Board of Directors
and shall outline RTD’s total investment return and compare the Portfolio’s performance to a
publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics.
Within 120 days of the end of RTD’s fiscal year, a comprehensive report on RTD’s investment
program and investment activity shall be prepared for the Board of Directors. The annual report
shall include quarterly comparisons of investment return and may suggest improvements that
might be made in the investment program. Such annual report shall include any other item of
significance which may enhance the understanding of the investment program. Each investment
advisor shall submit like reports in a timely manner based on the respective terms of each
contract and agreement
All securities holdings reports for RTD shall disclose the maximum maturity liability to RTD
(the stated maturity) as well as the first call date of each callable security held.
9. PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
RTD's Portfolio is managed with the objective of obtaining a market rate of return,
commensurate with identified risk constraints and cash flow characteristics. Because the
composition of the Portfolio fluctuates, depending on market and credit conditions, various
indices may be used to monitor investment performance.

The current board-approved index for the liquidity tier of the Portfolio (cash and cash
equivalents) is the 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index as published by Bank of America Merrill
Lynch. For the enhanced cash portion of the Portfolio (securities maturing between 90 days and
5 years and with a target duration of 1 year), the designated performance benchmark is the
Merrill Lynch 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.
RTD recognizes that bond proceeds must be invested in accordance with Section 1.148 of the
U.S. Internal Revenue Code, related to arbitrage rebate, which limits the investment returns
which may be achieved or retained by RTD on such proceeds investments. For purposes of this
Policy “bond proceeds” shall mean proceeds from the issuance of bonds, certificates of
participation or other financial securities issued by RTD.
10. INVESTMENT POLICY REVIEW AND APPROVAL
The CFO shall conduct a review of the Policy on an annual basis and present the Policy,
denoting any changes, to the Board of Directors for approval.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

RTD Board of Directors

Date:

From:

Tom Tobiassen, Chair of the Board

GM

Date:

November 11, 2016

Board Meeting Date: November 29, 2016

Subject:

RTD Bylaws Amendments

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Executive Committee and General Counsel that the Board of Directors approve
the amended Bylaws as outlined and attached through the November 15th Operations and Customer
Service Committee meeting.
BACKGROUND
The proposed amendments to the Bylaws have been reviewed by the Executive Committee and were
presented as an informational item to the last meeting of the Operations and Customer Service
Committee. The amendments address five general areas:
1. “Housekeeping” amendments to correct grammatical errors and obsolete usage, and to provide
direction on typical issues such as how much of the Recommended Action needs to be read out
loud at meetings.
2. Committee meeting and study session guidance. Currently the Bylaws lack written guidance on
how to conduct committee meetings and study sessions. The proposed amendments provide
guidance consistent with current informal practice.
3. Legal compliance. The proposed amendments fix incorrect statutory references and make RTD’s
practice on executive sessions consistent with state law (i.e., requiring a 2/3 vote to go into
executive session).
4. Bylaw amendment threshold. Currently RTD’s Bylaws require only 8 votes for amendments. This
low threshold is inconsistent with Robert’s Rules and general practice in other organizations,
which require a supermajority for Bylaw amendments. The proposed amendments would require a
2/3 supermajority (i.e., 10 votes).
5. Board office staff management. The current Bylaws involve the Board too deeply in determining
merit increases for all Board office staff – and, by implication, performance evaluation and other
supervisory duties. The proposed amendments specify that performance evaluation will be done
according to RTD standard practices, with evaluation of the Executive Manager to the Board to
be assigned to an AGM or higher level employee as determined by the Chair following
consultation with the GM and Executive Committee; and that performance evaluation shall
include soliciting input from all Directors.

Packet Pg. 235

13.H

ALTERNATIVES
1. Adopt the proposed amendments to the Bylaws. New Bylaws will be issued with a revised Table
of Contents and in single-spaced format. This is recommended to address the above issues.
2. Adopt some but not all of the proposed amendments to the Bylaws. Amendments to the
recommended action would need to be made at the Committee or Board meeting if such is
desired.
3. Reject the Recommended Action and do not approve the attached Bylaws. This is not
recommended because the Bylaws will continue to contain the errors and issues discussed above.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

From:

Heather McKillop,

Date:

Subject:

Approval of 2017 Contribution for the Salaried
Employee's Retirement Plans

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: November 9, 2016
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: November 29, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
adopt a 2017 contribution of $4.6 million to RTD’s Salaried Employees’ Defined Benefit Pension Trust
(the “DB Plan”), which pays a specified monthly benefit at retirement. It is also recommended that the
RTD Board of Directors adopt a 2017 contribution of 9% of each participant’s eligible compensation to
the Salaried Employees’ Defined Contribution Plan (the “DC Plan”), which contributes a specified amount
to the plan for each year of employment.
BACKGROUND
In December, 2007, the RTD Board of Directors closed the DB Plan to new employees with new
employees hired on January 1, 2008 and later participating in the DC Plan. From January 1, 2008 to
December 31, 2012 both the DB and DC Plan had been funded on a 9% of salaries basis.
DISCUSSION
DB Plan
In 2012, the Board of Directors agreed that beginning in 2013, annual contributions to the DB Plan
would be made at a fixed annual amount of $3.1 million rather than as a percentage of salaries as a
result of the actuary’s recommendation at that time. The fixed annual contribution of $3.1 million to the
DB Plan was determined by the plan’s actuaries to be the annual contribution necessary to maintain a
“fully funded” status for the plan in the future.
The actuaries have updated the DB Plan projections to reflect the final 1/1/2016 valuation assumptions
for the DB Plan. The 2017 Actuary recommended contribution is $7.63 million. If RTD contributes $4.6
million in 2017, $7.4 million in 2018, and a slightly declining amount each year, i.e. $7.2 million in
2019, 100% funding could be reached in 2031. This also assumes an annual rate of return of 7 1/2%
per year. This option has been deemed too costly to fund at this time.
The recommendation is to increase the annual fixed contribution by $500,000 to $4.6 million
DC Plan
Section 4.1 of the RTD Salaried Employees’ DC Plan adopted by the RTD Board provides that the
Employer may, at its sole discretion, set a contribution rate between 7 to 9% per year for participants.
The contribution rate has been 9% each year to the DC Plan from 2008 through 2016.

ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors adopts a 2017 contribution of $4.6 million to RTD’s Salaried Employees’ Defined
Benefit Pension Trust (the “DB Plan”), which pays a specified monthly benefit at retirement. It is
also recommended that the RTD Board of Directors adopt a 2017 contribution of 9% of each
participant’s eligible compensation to the Salaried Employees’ Defined Contribution Plan (the “DC
Plan”), which contributes a specified amount to the plan for each year of employment. These
amounts have been included in the 2017 Recommended Budget.
2. The RTD Board of Directors could certify an amount to be contributed to the RTD Salaried
Employees’ Defined Benefit Pension Trust or the RTD Salaried Employees’ Defined Contribution
Plan at amounts other than $4.6 million and 9%, respectively.
3. Do not authorize a contribution to the RTD Salaried Employees’ Pension Plans. This is not
recommended because the DB Plan’s funding status would deteriorate and the liability would
increase.

Subject:

2017 Salaried Benefit Plan

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: November 9, 2016
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: November 29, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approves the 2017 Plan Year Salaried Benefits plan and authorizes the General Manager/CEO or his
designee to enter into agreements with the insurance carriers.
BACKGROUND
Annually the staff brings the proposed Salaried Employee Benefits plan for approval to the Board of
Directors. Approval of the plan by the Board establishes the rates for Open Enrollment and provides
costs for the 2017 Budget. The Open Enrollment period for salaried staff begins November 6 through
November 20, 2016.
DISCUSSION
The goals for the 2017 plan year are: 1) Achieve the 2017 budget goals, 2) Continued focus on
containing cost and emphasis on improving health and wellness consumerism, 3) Maintain market
competitiveness, and 4) Insure compliance with PPACA – Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
(Health Care Reform provisions as applicable to RTD).
Following is a summary of the changes for the 2017 plan year.
Medical
- Cigna administers two self-funded plans on behalf of RTD. Both the PPO Plan and the HDHP (High
Deductible Health Plan) Plan have a specific individual $150,000 stop-loss ceiling in 2017. The
administrative cost will increase by 9.8% in 2017. The Cigna Plans are estimated to have
approximately 518 employees enrolled. 2016 claims are running slightly lower than expected claims
YTD and 2017 claims are currently projected to be marginally lower than 2016 levels. The overall
increase in total premium is expected to be 7.3%
-

Kaiser provides two plan options: a DHMO (HMO Plan with deductibles), and a HDHP. The Kaiser
plans are estimated to have approximately 223 employees enrolled. This plan has proposed a 3.7%
blended increase over 2016.

-

The employee cost share for 2017 will be 10% for the Cigna PPO and Kaiser DHMO plans and 5%
for the Cigna HDHP and Kaiser HDHP plans.

Cigna has agreed to provide $15,000 to our wellness program in 2017.
Dental
- No carrier/plan changes and a -2.8% renewal rate decrease based on reduced major claims and
increased preventative care.
- The employee cost share for 2017 will be 25% on the Preferred Provider plan and 20% on the
Exclusive Provider plan, which offers a much smaller dental network. RTD will pay slightly more of
the premium this year in order to smooth out the percentages.
-

Packet Pg. 325

13.J

Life & Disability
- Basic Life Insurance/AD&D, Voluntary Life/AD&D, Long and Short Term Disability are under a multiyear rate guarantee; however, we have anticipated a 3% increase in the non-voluntary plans based
on increase in salary dollars for 2017. Life Insurance and LTD premiums are salary based.
Vision/Business Travel Accident
- Vision Plan is currently a fully insured plan with Anthem Blue Cross–Blue Shield. A rate guarantee is
in effect through 2017 so there will be no increase in premium.
-

We recently renewed the organization’s Business Travel Accident insurance for three years; there
was no increase in premium.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The 2017 planned Salaried Employee Benefit budget is projected to be a 5.37 % increase over 2016
projected benefit costs. RTD’s current utilization and projections are below the national medical trend of
6.0%-with no plan changesi.
The major cost impacts in 2017 are due to Cigna plan increases of 7.3%. The net additional benefit
costs anticipated in 2017 are essentially flat. Reduction in the Transitional Reinsurance fees and rate
guarantees are responsible for results of an approximate overall 5.37% increase over last year. This is
the seventh year we have achieved strong cost containment as a result of our shift in carriers, plan
offerings, plan design and funding models.
The 2017 estimate of the Salaried Employee Insured Benefits is $11,816.598. The projected increase
of 5.37% results in an increase of $634,706 in 2017. The increase meets the projected costs in the
Strategic Budget Plan (SBP).

ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors approve the 2017 Plan Year Salaried Benefits plan and authorize the General Manager
or his designee to enter into agreements with the Insurance Carriers.
2. Further modify the salaried employee benefit plans to be offered in 2017. This is not
recommended since it would require additional negotiations with benefit providers and delay
the employee enrollment period.
3. Do not approve the recommended salaried employee benefit plans. This is not recommended, as
this will result in the Agency being unable to provide competitive and cost effective benefit
plans to the salaried employees.

NOTE: All projected costs are based on the current employees enrolled in 2016. Overall costs should
decrease as project employees complete their assigned projects and exit RTD throughout 2016.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

Date: November 28, 2016

From:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

November 28, 2016

Board Meeting Date: November 29, 2016

Subject:

Approval to Transfer funds and to Operate
Replacement Bus Service between Olde Town
Arvada and Denver Union Station.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended that the Board of Directors approve the provision of bus service to operate between
the Olde Town Arvada Park-n-Ride and Denver Union Station and further to transfer up to $500,000
from the FasTracks G-Line operating expense budget to fund such service through the opening of the GLine or such time as ridership may warrant earlier termination.
BACKGROUND
In February of 2003, the RTD Board of Directors approved the discontinuation of service on the SkyRide
Route AS west of the Stapleton transfer station due to low ridership at the Olde Town Arvada and Ward
Road Park-n-Rides. As a result of this action, interested parties in the City of Arvada developed a
business plan to implement scheduled shuttle van service to be operated directly between the Olde
Town Arvada Park-n-Ride and Denver International Airport (DIA). This service, called the “A-Line”, was
implemented May 11, 2003 to coincide with the elimination of RTD’s Route AS service to Arvada.
In order to secure the necessary financial support for the provision of A-Ride service between Arvada
and DIA, Ride Provide, Inc. filed for incorporation as a non-profit entity in the State of Colorado under
Section 7-122-102. The filing was made with the Secretary of State’s Office on February 18, 2003,
requesting incorporation as a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt non-profit corporation.
A-Line service was provided between the hours of 5:00 AM and 9:00 PM seven days per week. Fares
were $13 per passenger with a senior/student discount fare of $10. Monthly passes cost $120 and 10ride ticket books cost $90. A-Line ridership in 2015 was 78,626 boardings and averaged about 170
passengers per day. The service averaged about 4.6 boardings per hour, roughly the same as the
average productivity of a RTD Call-n-Ride. The customer profile/characteristics were about 80%
travelers, and 20% commuters/workers, very different than the old SkyRide ridership profile which was
more oriented to workers/commuters.
RTD provided financial support to help underwrite the provision of A-Line service since the inception of
the service in 2003. RTD initially provided $150,000 per year in support of the A-Line service. RTD’s
most recent contribution to support A-Line service was approximately $189,000 in 2016. We have
monitored the provision of service and have also provided technical assistance as requested. Over the
years, financial support has also been provided by The Arvada Urban Renewal Authority (AURA) and the
City of Arvada has also provided in-kind support, hard dollar contributions, or a combination of both. It
was anticipated that this A-Line service would be provided until the opening of the Eagle project
commuter rail service at which time the new commuter rail service would provide access between
Arvada and DIA. Given the anticipated opening of the G-Line commuter rail service in the fall of 2016,
Ride Provided, the 501(c)(3) non-profit organization providing the A-Line service, ceased operation of the

13.K

A-Line effective the end of October 2016. A-Line vehicles have exceeded their planned useful lives and
A-Line employees either have, or are seeking, alternative employment.
DISCUSSION
It is proposed that RTD provide replacement bus service commencing in early December to provide
access between Olde Town Arvada Park-n-Ride and DIA. This bus service would be operated between
Olde Town Arvada Park-n-Ride and Denver Union Station at which point customers would transfer to the
University of Colorado A-Line to DIA. On weekdays, service would be provided every 15-30 minutes via
RTD’s existing Route 55L service that operates from approximately 6:00 AM through 8:30 AM from
Olde Town Arvada to DUS. Starting at 9:00 AM, the recommended new replacement bus service would
operate hourly between Olde Town Arvada and DUS until 9:00 PM. Route 55L also provides 15-30
minute service on weekdays from DUS to Olde Town Arvada between the approximate hours of 3:45
PM through 5:45 PM. Weekend replacement service would be provided hourly between the hours of
6:00 AM and 6:00PM. The Route 55L does not operate on weekends. Fares for the service would
conform to the standard RTD fare policy, an RTD local fare between Arvada and DUS or a $9.00 airport
fare if travelling to DIA.
FINANICAL IMPACT
Service as outlined above would cost approximately $2,000.00 per day dependent on the development
of the final schedule and run-cut. The financial impact should not exceed $500,000 which will carry us
through July of 2017. Service cost could also be less if RTD determines that ridership levels of the new
replacement bus service do not merit continuation of the service. These funds are available from the
approved FasTracks Operating Expense budget established for the anticipated operation of the G-Line.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Approve the staff recommended action.
2. Don’t approve the staff recommended action. This is not the recommended action as the
community would lose convenient access between Olde Town Arvada and DIA until the opening
of the G-Line service in the future.
