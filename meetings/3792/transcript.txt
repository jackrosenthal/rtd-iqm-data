Operations, Safety and Security Committee
JOYANN RUSCHA: Present. Ready to go? OK. The Wednesday, May 14 Operations, Safety, and
Security Committee will now come to order.
We are convened as of 5:34 PM. I would respectfully ask that everyone attending this meeting to mute
yourself unless you are recognized to speak. Please note that committee meetings of the RTD Board of
Directors will be held remotely via Zoom and will be audio and video recorded.
The meeting recordings, along with the unofficial minutes of the meetings, will be posted as soon as
practicable on the board's website. During today's meeting, we are providing Communication Access
Realtime Translation, also known as CART. Anyone who would like access to this service should send an
email to the RTD Board Office at rtd.boardoffice@rtd-denver.com, and a link will be provided.
Additionally, the CART transcripts can be automatically translated to Spanish and a live stream of this
meeting is also available via RTD's YouTube page. I would now like to call the roll for our committee
members. Of note, Directors Buzek and Whitmore do have excused absences this evening. And with that,
Director Chandler.
KATHLEEN CHANDLER: Present.
JOYANN RUSCHA: Welcome, nice to see you. Director Harwick.
IAN HARWICK: Here.
JOYANN RUSCHA: Nice to see you too. Director Paglieri.
BRETT PAGLIERI: Present.
JOYANN RUSCHA: Wonderful. Director Nicholson.
CHRIS NICHOLSON: I have arrived.
JOYANN RUSCHA: All right. And I am Chair Ruscha. I am here. And we are now officially convened. I do
know that we have some additional directors present.
Director Harwick or Mr. Kroll, would either one of you mind advising me who is present, as I'm looking at a
different screen, so I can make note of that?
JACK KROLL: Yes, Chair Ruscha. Present in addition to the committee members are Chairman Bouquet,
Director Catlin, First Vice Chair Patrick O'Keefe, and I believe that was everyone that I had seen.
IAN HARWICK: Director Guzman is here.
JACK KROLL: Oh, and Director Guzman. Yes, he was the first-- he gets credit for being the first director
on tonight. So, Director Guzman, my apologies. He is also present.
JOYANN RUSCHA: Hi, well, welcome fellow colleagues. I'm glad to have you tonight. And I do believe
that Director Guzman trekked home really fast in the rain to make this meeting, so extra extra credit. But
we appreciate you joining us tonight.

So we will go on with public comment and then a couple of housekeeping orders and then proceed into
business. Mr. Kroll is-- oh, I'm sorry. Did I-CHRIS NICHOLSON: My apologies.
JOYANN RUSCHA: Oh, OK. Mr. Kroll is going to help us manage the public comment queue for us. So,
Mr. Kroll you may go ahead and call on folks as a chair would ordinarily do and recognize them in kind.
If we do have any members of the public that we know to be elected officials, just remember, we tend to
give them priority in the speaking order so that they can get back to their regular duties. I also just want to
advise that folks can dial in. And I apologize because I might-- either I missed that part of the script, or I
was going to hand it over to Mr. Kroll. I almost called you director. Our silent director, Mr. Kroll.
But with that, Mr. Kroll, if you could kindly take over for the public comment portion, I would appreciate it.
And I will go ahead and yield the floor to you, sir.
JACK KROLL: Thank you, Chair Ruscha. At this time, members of the public who are present on Zoom or
who have dialed in, please raise your hand to indicate that you would like to provide public comment. At
this juncture, I'm seeing quite a few folks here, so we will work through in the order in which hands were
raised.
When your name is called, we will unmute you. Please state your name for the record, and then you will
have three minutes to provide your remarks. As a reminder, your remarks are being recorded. If you do
not wish to have your remarks recorded, you are always welcome to submit your comments in writing.
If by chance you would like a response from the committee, the committee does not typically respond to
public comment as it is being provided. You may submit written public comment to the board office at
rtd.boardoffice@rtd-denver.com. And we will provide a response.
With that, we're going to now move to our first speaker in the queue, and that is Mr. Earl Lee. Mr. Lee,
you are now recognized, and you have three minutes to provide your comments.
EARL LEE: Thank you, Mr. Kroll. The RTD Board is asked to make decisions that affect riders that they
themselves may not have real-world experience to support their decisions. This may not be more true
than those decisions regarding people with disabilities paratransit.
Access-on-Demand, the supplemental service to Access-a-Ride has demonstrated the ability to fill the
need where Access-a-Ride is falling short. Rather than trying to restrict Access-on-Demand to just
another failing service or eliminating it, RTD should analyze what areas Access-on-Demand is meeting
the expectations and needs of people with disabilities and incorporate those changes as much as
possible into Access-a-Ride to improve the service. One of the differences between the two services
being considered for a change is the pickup location restriction.
For Access-a-Ride, it must be within 3/4 of a mile of an RTD bus stop or station while currently, there is
no limit for Access-on-Demand. This can mean, by using an address only, someone can be ineligible for
Access-a-Ride while a neighbor across the street or three doors down are eligible for Access-a-Ride. The
limitation for Access-a-Ride is federally mandated by Federal Transportation Administration, so RTD
cannot modify the rule.
The public, and perhaps many on the board, are not aware of this. The public perception, and especially
in the disability community, is that the board-- is that RTD is simply inflexible. Access-on-Demand is not
subject to the same FTA rules.
RTD can set limits on Access-on-Demand, but they can be expanded, for example, within two miles of a
stop or station, with flexibility when a local bus route or stop is modified. This prevents the odd long-

distance request while servicing the needs of the disability community. Access-on-Demand is not a
luxury. It is truly a lifeline for many people with disabilities who are very capable and who contribute to
society. They pay taxes, and they support economy as long as they can get to their jobs and enjoy the
freedom of travel. Thank you.
JACK KROLL: Thank you, Mr. Lee. The next person we have in the queue is Rachel Lehman. You are
now recognized. Please state your name, and begin your remarks. You will have three minutes.
RACHAEL LEHMAN: Hi, my name is-- oh, my camera's not on. I don't know why-- oh, here we go. Sorry,
I don't know how to turn on my camera. Yeah, anyway. My name is-JACK KROLL: It's OK. Typically, the camera feature is turned off for folks providing public comment.
RACHAEL LEHMAN: OK, just making sure. OK, good afternoon, Directors. My name is Rachel Lehman,
and I am the legislative affairs liaison for the Brown and Black Parents United Foundation. Our service
area covers North Denver, Commerce City, and Aurora.
The communities in which my organization serves would be particularly impacted by the 2025-2028 Title
VI update. I'd like to begin by sharing some personal context. I've lived abroad and seen what truly
effective public transportation looks like.
Here in Denver, Montbello included, there have been long stretches, up to two years at a time, when I
didn't own a car. So I relied entirely on public transportation. I know firsthand what it means to depend on
these services and how your life can be shaped by late or early buses or by routes that only one runs an
hour. While some lines, like the 15, are impressively frequent, the gaps elsewhere are hard to ignore.
There's a reason people talk about world-class public transportation because it's possible. But it takes
honest commitment and real engagement. I want to acknowledge the efforts of the team that has created
one-page explainers of RTD's draft to the civil rights report.
However, I am frustrated by what currently passes for community involvement. Just look at the RTD's
draft civil rights report. It's more than 1,000 pages long. How many people have the time and the stamina
to read and understand it in full?
Making decisions that will directly impact people's lives without real engagement or understanding is
simply irresponsible. I want to focus on the Census data and the equity analysis. For context, I'm a
sociologist with deep experience in data validity and reliability. I've even done door-to-door canvassing
myself of the Census.
The Census Bureau's work is in many ways, one of the most sophisticated and ambitious survey efforts in
the world. In 2020, the national completion rate was 99.98% with a self-response rate of 66.5%. The
Census tries to count every household, apartment, single-family homes, and colleges, and more.
While using US Census data is a best practice, there are still persistent gaps. And I urge RTD to
supplement it with additional data sources. What this means is that there's a real risk of undercounting the
very communities that are most likely to be disproportionately impacted by transit or policy decisions. In
times like this, data-driven decisions are important, but we also need to recognize the limits of the data
and stay grounded in the realities of oppression and inequality that shape our society.
Over the past few years, I've seen how quickly rights can be stripped from the most vulnerable among us.
It's not enough to assume that hard-won rights will simply endure. We have to actively protect them and
ensure that our policies and processes genuinely serve everyone, not just ones that already have a seat
at the table. Thank you.

JACK KROLL: you, Ms. Lehman. The next individual who will be recognized to provide public comment is
Megan Kemp. Please state your name. You have three minutes to provide your remarks.
MEGAN KEMP: Great, thank you. Thanks for the opportunity to provide comments today. My name is
Megan Kemp. I'm sorry for my voice. I'm getting over an illness.
I serve as the Colorado policy advocate with Earthjustice. We frequently partner with community groups
to advance and protect environmental and climate justice and have represented groups in matters
defending civil rights impacts and transportation planning. To better promote equitable public
transportation for all living in the Greater Denver Metro area, I urge the board to adopt the Title VI
program updates put forth by the Transit Equity Office.
Given transportation's role in accelerating the climate crisis and degrading air quality, especially here in
Colorado's Front Range, it is imperative that transit solutions are targeted at increasing reliable,
affordable, and accessible transit to the communities that need them the most. The recommended
updates to the policies are a step toward closing gaps and eliminating barriers for underserved
communities that rely on public transit every day. Denver metro communities that lack access to reliable
public transit are also those that experience the worst air quality and the associated health and
cumulative impacts that come with breathing dirtier air.
Tailpipe emissions are a major source of ground-level ozone, which makes it difficult for residents to
breathe, can cause childhood asthma, and can even lead to premature death. Without equity-centered
policies and programs, RTD risks perpetuating long-standing patterns of exclusion, particularly in areas
that have not received their fair share of transit investment. The Title VI program update should rely on
US Census data to evaluate service equity in absence of robust ridership data.
This data source also captures communities and residents that are historically and currently underserved
by public transit, ensuring that communities that need RTD services are given consideration in transit
decisions. Earthjustice also supports the proposed program updates to the major service change policy.
These changes should only occur after ample public review or equity analysis is complete by capturing
cumulative changes over 36-month period and broadening the definition of what qualifies as a major
service change, including shifts in frequency, route miles, and service hours.
RTD is taking a more responsive and transparent approach to measuring impact. Additionally, adjusting
the low-income threshold to 200% of the federal poverty level also ensures that public transit planning
captures residents that experience the burdens of inflation and the Denver Metro's high cost of living,
factors that are more likely to make one dependent on public transit. In the interest of safeguarding public
health for underserved and overburdened communities in the Denver Metro area and complying with
antidiscrimination requirements in Title VI, I and Earthjustice urge you to better address racial and
economic disparities in transit access by approving the RTD Title VI program update. Thank you.
JACK KROLL: Thank you, Megan. Next, we will have Nam Henderson. Nam, you are recognized. You
have three minutes to provide your remarks. Looks like-- oh, Nam's back. OK, Nam.
NAM HENDERSON: Thanks so much, I appreciate it. And hopefully, y'all can hear me. I just want to join
a number of the voices that have spoken in support of the 25-2028 Title VI program updates that would
help RTD service changes be more considerate of marginalized people who rely on transit.
I understand some have proposed prioritizing ridership demographics and alternative modeling methods
instead of US Census data. However, RTD's passenger counters track boarding and exits, but not
demographics. My ride data is limited by privacy rules, and the live income-based discount program
reaches only a fraction of low-income customers. Importantly, Census-based geographic data also helps
address long-standing inequities caused by discriminatory planning practices. And finally, RTD cannot
base decisions solely on who is riding today. Its obligation is to the service area as a whole and our future
citizens.

Also, while some may object to raising the low-income definition from 150% to 200% of the federal
poverty level, since it's not required, raising the threshold as others have spoken to better reflects the cost
of living in the Denver region, more closely aligns with RTD's live program, and ensures more inclusive
representation of low-income households when determining whether a fare or major service change will
disproportionately impact these communities in its equity analysis. So again, I just urge you to pass and
support those 2025-28 Title VI program updates. Thank you so much.
JACK KROLL: Thank you, Nam. Next, we will recognize Adrienne Razavi.
ADRIENNE RAZAVI: Hello.
JACK KROLL: Adrienne, we can hear you. And you now have three minutes to provide your remarks.
Please state your name, and begin your remarks.
ADRIENNE RAZAVI: Awesome, thank you. Good evening, board members. My name is Adrienne Razavi.
And I'm speaking on behalf of the Denver Streets Partnership.
Our mission is to advocate for the cultural and systemic changes necessary to reduce our city's
unsustainable dependence on cars and to design communities that put people first. I'm here tonight to
voice our support for the proposed Title VI program update. We are particularly encouraged to see a
focus on analyzing cumulative impacts in the major service change policy.
In a city like Denver, where historic disinvestment and discriminatory planning have shaped access to
transportation, evaluating changes in isolation fails to capture how service cuts or adjustments over time
compound and worsen conditions for communities already facing mobility barriers. Including cumulative
changes over a 36-month period is critical for ensuring that inequities don't slip through the cracks. We
also strongly support raising the low-income threshold from 150% to 200% of the federal poverty level.
Transportation is one of the greatest financial burdens on households in Denver, especially for people
ineligible for current low-income discounts but still struggling to afford basic needs. This change better
reflects our region's high cost of living and ensures that fare and service equity analyses more accurately
represent the economic reality faced by many families. We urge the board to adopt the Title VI program
update as proposed by the Transit Equity Office and to stay true to the spirit of Title VI by protecting not
only current riders, but also those who rely on improved and equitable transit to access opportunity. Sorry
about that. Thank you.
JACK KROLL: Thank you, Adrienne. Next, we will recognize Sarah Oliver. Sarah, please state your
name, and you may begin your remarks. You have three minutes.
SARAH OLIVER: Hi, there. Can everybody hear me?
JACK KROLL: Yes.
SARAH OLIVER: OK, perfect. Hello to the board. My name is Sarah Oliver, and I'm one of the many
working people who utilize bus and train transit exclusively without a car.
I'm sharing with you tonight my take on some of the board concerns surrounding the proposed Title VI
updates. RTD regularly updates its services to best serve the communities it connects. In order to do that,
it requires the best data available. RTD must be sure the service changes reflect the needs of those who
depend on it the most. To make those changes ethically and effectively, we need the most accurate data
available.
This is why leveraging annually updated Census data can help ensure a transit system serves those of us
who could not get around without it. Freedom of mobility is a social justice concern, a climate concern, as
well as a concern of autonomy, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Using Census and other specific

demographic data helps RTD anticipate the needs of the communities it serves, which are always
growing and changing, rather than relying on less specific, limited data that does not involve
demographics, such as number of boardings.
This data is blind to important factors, such as how often this rider might rely on RTD for the majority of
their travel, their income and disability statuses, and demographics. Census data does a better job of
projecting into the future and identifying populations of customers who will use transit regularly and what
their needs will be in the future when decisions are made now. When service availability is better, more
people utilize transit.
While Title VI doesn't explicitly require raising the low income definition, doing so can grant RTD deeper
insight into the needs of these customers and ensure greater equity and compliance with FTA. RTD has a
responsibility to the entire area it serves with respect to freedom of movement for those with no other way
to get around. And the city functions only as well as its least connected parts. The equity analyses are
worth it to RTD to ensure as many customers as possible are reached. Thank you very much.
JACK KROLL: Thank you, Sarah. Next, we will recognize Rebeca Medrano. Rebeca, please introduce
yourself. You have three minutes to provide your remarks.
REBECA MEDRANO: Thank you. Good evening, Directors. My name is Rebeca Medrano, and I am with
Conservation Colorado. Our organization is dedicated to advancing environmental justice and ensuring
that all communities, especially those historically underserved, have access to clean air, safe
neighborhoods, and reliable public transit among many other environmental advancements and
protections for all Coloradans.
I'm here today to express our support for the Title VI program update. This year, we proudly supported
the passage of Senate Bill 25-030 and Senate Bill 25-161, laws aimed to expand transit options, address
gaps in service, and align transportation planning with Colorado's climate goals. They reflect our
commitment to building a transit system that serves everyone, not just those with the loudest voices or
the most resources. And that often takes supporting, bold, more creative moves beyond what is required
of us.
The communities we work for, Black, Indigenous, and other people of color, as well as low-income
neighborhoods have long faced the brunt of environmental injustices. They endure higher levels of
pollution, limited access to quality transit, and are often excluded from decision-making processes. Their
transit priorities are clear, affordable, reliable, and frequent services that connect them to jobs, education,
health care, and other essential services.
These priorities align with the goals of the Title VI program update, which seeks to eliminate
discrimination and ensure equitable access to transit services. Regarding the proposed changes to the
Title VI program update, Conservation Colorado believes they are both necessary and overdue.
Considering cumulative impacts, for example, over a longer period of time is vital in understanding the
historical disenfranchisement of disproportionately impacted communities.
And by expanding the criteria for equity analysis, RTD can better identify and mitigate potential adverse
effects on underserved communities. These proposed changes are about understanding the true
reflection of what being an underserved person trying to survive in Colorado, one of the 10 most
expensive states to live in, is actually like. In conclusion, we urge the Board to approve the 2025-2028
Title VI program update. Doing so will affirm RTD's commitment to equity, environmental justice, and the
well-being of all of its riders. Thank you.
JACK KROLL: Thank you, Rebeca. Next, we will recognize Camila Restrepo. Camila, you have three
minutes to provide your remarks. Please introduce yourself, and begin your remarks.

CAMILA RESTREPO: Thank you. My name is Camila Restrepo. Good evening, RTD Board. I live in RTD
district 3-- or District C and work in RTD District D, and I'm the community leadership program manager at
a local nonprofit organization called Commune.
Commune is named after the verb of community-- to commune, to come together. We serve the
multicultural, multilingual, and intergenerational communities of Southwest Denver, Sheridan, and
Lakewood by providing resources such as fresh food, connections to financial support, and a sense of
belonging. An important component of being able to bring people together is their access to
transportation. The '25 to '28 Title VI program update would make public transportation more accessible
to many in our community, especially through the language access and major service change policy
components of the plan.
Some of our participants who live in Lakewood are asylum seekers and refugees from Arabic-speaking
countries, such as Syria and Jordan. They are grandmothers, mothers, and children who don't speak any
English and who are trying to navigate a new and foreign country. These are people who have come here
because it is their only option.
They carry stories of having to leave their home countries against their will, not knowing if they will ever
see home again due to their home country being too unsafe and unstable to live or raise their families
there. One of our community leaders told me a story about experiencing an explosion in a grocery store
as she was out running for her errands for the day to cook dinner for her family while she was six months
pregnant. The US and Colorado are often their third or fourth place where they've tried to find peace and
stability, often having made their way through refugee camps, European countries where they live in
poverty because they can't work before finding their way to the states.
Another woman younger than myself recounted her experience of trying to make money to support her
family in Turkey at 18 years old, knocking storefront doors to find work that make ends meet. This
community has found a sense of belonging at commune because we provide language access through
translated materials, interpretation, and staff members who are bilingual in Arabic and English. This is
something that is more difficult to find close to where they live, so they travel to get here.
The majority of these community members don't have cars and can't drive, and at times they get rides
from other community members, but that availability is limited. Many have expressed fear of taking the
bus and taking Public Transportation because they don't speak English and because materials aren't
available in their language and they fear getting lost. We at Commune are grateful for the TAG program
and the LIVE program that have made taking the RTD more affordable for our community.
So today, I urge you, Board of RTD, to continue this important work of making our Regional
Transportation Services more accessible to all Coloradans by supporting all components of the '25-'28
Title VI RTD update. Thank you.
JACK KROLL: Thank you, Camila. Next, we will recognize Miah Netepp-- or, excuse me, Miah Ntepp.
Miah, you have the floor. You have three minutes to provide your remarks. Please provide your name and
commence.
MIAH NTEPP: Hi, there. My name is Miah Ntepp. I represent the Denver NAACP. I'm our legislative
liaison. We've been fighting for Civil Rights since 1909.
Members of the board, again, I'm here on behalf of the NAACP Denver branch to speak in support of
RTD's Title VI program update. We have a saying, and it's freedom moves when we all can go, equity in
every mile. Members, the reality of the situation is Black communities across Denver, including Montbello
and Aurora, continue to feel the deep and lasting effects of displacement.
Longtime residents have been pushed farther from the urban core, often into areas with fewer resources
and less transit access. As a result and an outcome, families now face longer, more complicated

commutes just to reach our jobs, our schools, and meet basic needs. In too many cases, they have to rely
on multiple transfers just to get to where they need to go.
Furthermore, we see inequities in the lack of shelters, benches, and basic maintenance at bus stops in
our neighborhoods, along with limited frequency of services in some areas. Now, these aren't just
inconveniences, they're the result of public investment decisions that have, over time, prioritized some
neighborhoods over others. Now, this program update strengthens the foundation for equity by, excuse
me, sharpening RTD's tools for preventing harm. And to my understanding, it requires the agency to
evaluate services or fare changes based on where people live, a very, very critical lens in a region still
shaped by the geography of redlining. It also calls for more intentional public engagement and improved
language assistance, which is important in communities like Aurora, where African immigrants and
refugees are vital members of our civic fabric.
Now, members, the Denver NAACP urges the Board to adopt this update. As Civil Rights protections
come under threat nationwide, it's essential that the RTD continue the legacy of equity, Black transit
justice, leaders who understood that access to transit is access to opportunity and access to community,
as was previously just stated. This program is a step in the right direction. Members, we hope that you
support this update.
JACK KROLL: Thank you, Miah. Next, we will recognize Ashley Kidder. Ashley have three minutes. The
floor is yours. Please introduce yourself, and begin your remarks.
ASHLEY KIDDER: Hi, my name is Ashley Kidder. I am here also in support of the Transit Equity Office's
Title VI program update. For reference, I am a daily rider of RTD. In 2020, I sold my car right before the
pandemic hit. And since then I have been a daily rider on mostly the 31 bus route, the 15, 15L, 16, 28, 32,
and W line.
I feel like my fellow commenters have done an amazing job talking about data-driven analysis and how
RTD can be more equitable, especially Rachel, Megan, and Adrienne. So I don't want to hammer those
notes again. Instead, I would like to talk about anecdotal information that I receive from friends, from
fellow community members who are invested in RTD and also, on online forums, such as Reddit, where I
have to give a shout out to Director Nicholson, who I do see commenting frequently on posts and threads
about RTD.
So thank you for your engagement in that avenue. What I hear a lot about why people don't ride RTD,
one is the infrequency, and that's a topic for another discussion, but two, it's because people feel unsafe.
And I've spent a lot of time in other cities that have more robust transit, such as New York.
And if you've ever ridden in the subway in New York, there is an unspoken agreement that if you get into
a train and it's empty, you need to find another train because something weird or something fishy or
something unsafe is going on. The idea is that the more you are surrounded by your community in transit,
the safer you are. And from what I hear from friends or just from acquaintances who I tell them, yeah, I
don't have a car, and I just ride the bus primarily, and they make that face at me like, oh, my gosh, are
you crazy? Don't you feel unsafe?
And that is a common thread, especially on the online forums on Reddit, is that people do not feel safe
riding RTD in this city, unfortunately. In my opinion, the way to get more ridership, RTD needs to expand
its analysis in how it collects its data in terms of Census data and annual data that is updated every year
and also by getting more riders by expanding the low income definition of the federal poverty level to
200%. I don't think I need to talk about how expensive eggs are, but we are all feeling that pinch,
especially those who need these services the most. So again, I urge the board to adopt the new Title VI
program update. And thank you so much for your time.

JACK KROLL: Thank you, Ashley. Just as a heads-up for folks, we have three individuals left who have
raised their hands. Next, we will recognize Ruby Lopez. Ruby, you are recognized. You have three
minutes to provide your remarks. Please state your name, and commence.
RUBY LOPEZ: Hello, everyone present. My name is Ruby Lopez. I work with Fortaleza Familiar, a
Denver-based organization that works with young queer and trans people of color and their families. We
strongly support the approval of RTD's Title VI program updates because I've seen time and time again
just how dependent the communities we work with are on having consistent and low-cost or free access
to public transit.
Having an equitable public transit in Denver is not just about getting from point A to B or taking a joyride
on an RTD bus. No, for many people in this city, it's about survival, freedom, and dignity. Right now,
Denver is going through a period of rapid development, and that is a great thing.
But as often happens with developing cities, hard-working Americans are being displaced and priced out
of their own neighborhoods at an alarming rate. With housing becoming increasingly unaffordable in
Denver, our communities are being pushed farther and farther from their jobs and communities in Denver.
In order to support our growing economy, we need a robust, extensive, and equitable transit system that
can rival the transit systems of any other major global city.
This will ensure that all people in the Greater Denver Metro area, especially those that lack financial
resources, can make it to work, school, see their doctors, and more. RTD has a lot of potential to grow
and become an exemplary model of a modern transit system. That is why I am here, urging the board and
decision-makers here today to please prioritize the areas within our transit system that have been
historically underinvested in. For those of you more compelled by economic rhetoric than civil rights
rhetoric, please note that this Title VI program update is not just helping the marginalized. It is also a
great investment into our city that, over time, will strengthen our economy and yield return on investment,
measurable in both economic metrics as well as quality of life metrics.
To be sure, the proposed Title VI program update is not a fix all, but it is a step in the right direction. It
straightens how equity is assessed by using data that reflects where people live, not just where they
currently reside. It expands definitions of major service changes and takes important steps towards
language justice for those whose first language isn't English because, after all, they also participate in our
economy, and they deserve to get around too. This program lays the groundwork for future action, and
we hope to see it truly reflect the needs of the communities that are most affected. Thank you.
JACK KROLL: Thank you, Ruby. At this point, we will recognize Hildana Liben. Hildana, the floor is yours.
Please state your name, and begin your remarks. You will have three minutes.
HILDANA LIBEN: Thank you. Good evening, my name's Hildana Liben, and I'm speaking today in support
of the Title VI recommendation updates. Specifically, I want to highlight raising the low income threshold
from 150% to 200% of the federal poverty level. As some argue, it's not required by Title VI.
As the cost of living in Denver continues to rise and uncertainty continues to grow in our communities, I
think it's essential for RTD to continue to expand the support it offers. I'm a recent college graduate where
I've relied on RTD transit to get me to and from campus and other academic obligations. Every day, I
shared my commute with my peers from Aurora to Denver since we all relied on RTD as the most
affordable way to navigate our community as commuter students.
Today, the situation is different from even a year ago, I would say. Conversations with friends, family,
coworkers, even strangers now revolve around ways that we can make a dollar stretch. I urge the board
to continue being a pillar in the Denver community by prioritizing raising the income threshold for transit
discounts, and I would say, based on my personal experiences and observations, these decisions are
crucial for many as students, families, workers are carefully balancing essential expenses at the moment.

Affordable transit can make a huge impact to ensure people can continue to rely on RTD during these
trying times. Thank you.
JACK KROLL: Thank you, Hildana. We actually have two additional public speakers left. Next, we will
recognize Nate Trela.
Nate, you are recognized. You may commence your remarks. Please state your name. You will have
three minutes.
NATE TRELA: Thank you. This is Nate Trela from Englewood. I would like to thank the Board again for
the opportunity to once again, address Access-on-Demand. For more than a year, we've been discussing
the value of Access-on-Demand, as you've been discussing changes to control the cost of the program
and make it sustainable.
I see in your packets two proposals tonight from staff, both of which I think are based on a flawed premise
that Access-on-Demand is a-- it seems like it's being treated as a failure of a program because of the cost
and popularity of the program. When you see 500,000 rides for about $56 million in the core paratransit
program versus about 680,000 rides for $13.6 million in access on demand. That sure seems to me like
access on demand is a success from a financial standpoint.
I don't understand why, perhaps, the creativity isn't there to see it. Maybe what we should be doing is
trying to encourage more use of Access-on-Demand in the place of core Access-a-Ride, freeing up the
accessible vehicles for people that need that equipment, thus improving service to them as well. Accesson-Demand has been a flexible, cheaper, more robust solution for people with disabilities in the Denver
area since its founding. And there are ways to make the program sustainable that don't make it less
effective or a less valuable program.
Fares make sense. Although, the convoluted tiered fare system in one of those proposals tonight that
you'll be looking at tonight is mind boggling how that could require another $40,000 to $50,000 in HR
costs to administer. It certainly seems like you issue three vouchers instead of one for the different tiers of
fares if that's really the way you want to go. And I don't know if that's a lack of creativity or if there's
something that I'm not aware of that somebody outside of the system.
And I can almost guarantee that, as you're looking at these changes, the nearly $900,000 in savings that
supposedly will be there from cutting back the service area to match the core Access-a-Ride hours and
boundaries will be offset by more than $900,000 of salaries lost by people who can no longer get to their
jobs. There are a lot of fantastic jobs people with disabilities are doing around Metro Denver that are not
in the core of the city because they're in warehouses. They're opportunities like that, Amazon in particular,
where people will not be able to access those jobs. People will lose jobs because of those cuts.
I just want to wrap up by saying, for a lot of people tonight, talking about how freedom moves and how
social justice and access are priorities. I'd encourage our friends who have been talking tonight to help
and help us maintain a robust and valuable program for people with disabilities. RTD says you want to
make lives better through connections, and I truly believe that. Don't make those connections harder or
even impossible with some of these changes that are being suggested for Access-on-Demand.
JACK KROLL: Thank you, Nate. Our final speaker in the queue is Paolo Solorzano. Paolo, the floor is
yours. You may introduce yourself. You have three minutes to provide your remarks.
PAOLO SOLORZANO: Hi, Paulo Solorzano with the RTD Riders Alliance. The RTD Riders Alliance
wholeheartedly supports the board's draft of the RTD Title VI updates. We represent transit-dependent
RTD riders.
We support raising the income threshold for defining low-income populations because this acknowledges
the very real cost of living here in Denver and the surrounding areas. Our cost of living and housing costs

are already punishing enough for anyone making less than $60,000-- of the median income of $60,000
per capita in Denver. The proposed 200% of the federal poverty level is still $30,000 per year for one
person, only half of the median income.
Two years ago, Charles Schwab released a report that 53% of Denverites reported living paycheck to
paycheck, struggling to cover their monthly expenses with their income. Sorry, with their income, leaving
little money for savings or unexpected costs. In the Denver Metro area, renters experience monthly rent
increases of $150 to $200 per month as a matter of course.
Providing more frequent, reliable, and accessible service in communities with the highest levels of
housing instability could be the real difference between falling behind on rent or bills for hundreds, if not
thousands, of local riders. Cancellations and delays, of course, have been a facet of life for many RTD
riders, with recent severe service disruptions and having to simply call a Lyft or Uber four times a month,
can easily equal $200 or more of unforeseen costs. Thereby, this creates housing insecurity. These
updates could really help with that.
And now, as far as the updates that emphasize proactive equity analysis and identifying and mitigating
harms before implementing fare or service changes, I want to give an example. The route 16L was
eliminated, and that was a limited stop service along West Colfax Avenue. It has impacted transit riders
and particularly those relying on efficient connections between Denver, Lakewood, and West Colfax.
This corridor does have a significant amount of affordable housing and community services, and
consolidating the 16L riders into the 16 has led to overcrowding, especially during peak hours and
especially since many riders who live on the route are elderly or use mobility or wheelchairs. The updates
to Title VI could help monitor impacts to communities such as the West Colfax corridor. And then lastly,
as far as the strong language and access Plan, let's not forget that Aurora, Colorado is one of the most
ethnically diverse cities in the nation.
And I just want to provide a comment that, while I was doing surveys with RTD on board, the Spanish
speakers I spoke to, almost half of them did not know about the incredible LIVE program and that that
was available to them. So for all these reasons, yeah, we definitely support this. Thank you.
JACK KROLL: Thank you, Paolo. Madam Chair, that concludes the speaker queue. If you would like, I
may now read into the record the names and topics of those who provided written comment. I believe you
indicated in the affirmative. Despite you being on mute, I will go ahead and read those in.
Michael Brown wrote in regarding Colfax BRT project. GDT, by way of Richard Bamber, wrote a letter that
touched on Title VI and customer-facing communications. The city and county of Broomfield, represented
by staff member Sarah Grant, sent you all a letter related to the Title VI policy.
Craig Tyler, director of Public Policy and Advocacy for the Center for People with Disabilities, wrote in
regarding Title VI. Alex Kalkhofer submitted a request for increase RTD service and progress on the
Northwest Rail line to Longmont. Claire Eggleston submitted a letter in support of Title VI. And Stephen
Angelo submitted a commendation letter recognizing the work of staff on the FlexRide program that he
utilizes. And with that, Chair, Ruscha. I have no further public comment to impart to the committee.
JOYANN RUSCHA: Thank you, sir. So just some quick housekeeping before we get on to business. I'd
also like to say thank you to everyone who took the time to weigh in with public comment, attend
meetings with staff, and participate in this really important process.
So housekeeping, we are going to keep the timer just like we did last time. We do have a lot to go through
tonight. And it's also pretty policy heavy and dense and items that the committee has been waiting for and
preparing for and working on for months. So we're going to extend that timer to two minutes.

When it dings, that's just your cue to wrap it up. And we'll move on to the next person. So we're going to
pass the baton before you do a follow up. That's a recommended practice in Robert's Rules. And it's just
a way for us to share space.
I am going to call on committee members to take the first pass at any comments or questions. And then,
again, hold the follow-up. We're going to pass the baton, and then we're going to go to our non-OSS
members because, again, we have big policy items that could impact-- that do impact, excuse me, the
whole region, all of our constituents. And we want to share space. So we'll go to our colleagues who are
not members on OSS, circle back to OSS, and then wrap it up again with our colleagues.
Finally, please refrain from asking leading questions of staff. It's OK to have an opinion, and I know it's a
bit of a gray area, but we don't want to ask gotcha questions or disparage anybody. Not that it's anyone's
intent, but sometimes it's what folks hear and not what we meant to say.
So just be careful. It's all right to ask tough questions. It's OK to ask big questions, but we want to keep it
on the merits and respect staff's jobs so that we can do our jobs.
And so with that, we're going to move into recommended actions. There are two recommended amended
actions on the agenda this evening. The first is for the 2025 to 2028 Title VI program update for the board
of directors to adopt the Title VI program update to comply with federal laws, regulations, and guidelines
related to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Do we have a motion?
IAN HARWICK: Yes, me.
JOYANN RUSCHA: I think that was Director Harwick. Thank you. And a second?
BRETT PAGLIERI: Second.
JOYANN RUSCHA: It was Director Paglieri. Thank you. OK, so with Hildana as a mover and Paglieri as a
second, we now have a valid motion on the table.
So I would like to ask. I believe it is Mr. Romero, Transit Equity Manager, as well as Mr. Carl Green, Jr.,
director of Civil Rights Office, to present this item to the committee. Sir or sirs, when you are ready, you
may proceed.
CARL GREEN JR.: Is the screen good to go?
JOYANN RUSCHA: Yes, it is. Thank you.
CARL GREEN JR.: Thank you so much, Chair Ruscha. Good evening, fellow board of directors and RTD
staff. I just want to take a moment. I've been just hearing all the public comment and just wanting to
present and deliver this presentation and to copresent.
It is my esteemed pleasure to copresent the 2025 Title VI program this evening with Transit Equity
Manager Martin Romero. I just want to highlight, even just thinking about all the public comment received
tonight, I'm extremely proud of the Transit Equity Office, along with the rest of the agency of building out
this Title VI program. This is the fifth program update that I've presented to the board of directors, whether
that be at my previous agency at TriMet or here at the Regional Transportation District.
And what I can say is the Transit Equity Office, Martin Romero, Dani McClain, Lorena Gonzalez, they
definitely showed up and showed out to ensure that we are developing and building out a program that
will do it justice in terms of ensuring that we're providing equitable transit services throughout our 2,345square mile service area. This program, it stands for many things. It's more than just the 1,000 pages-- or
1,000 pages in a document. It's a testament to RTD's commitment to ensuring fair and accessible transit
services over the past three years.

As you will note, there's over 1,000 pages. But 70% of that document is what the agency, collectively, as
a team, has been able to carry out over these past three years, showcasing many different milestones
such as our system-wide fare study and equity analysis. And what this program represents is what we are
slated to do over the next three years as a foundation. The implementation of RTD's Title VI program, it
truly takes a team to really implement and to live out the principles rooted in Title VI of the Civil Rights Act
of 1964. This program serves as a cornerstone that is truly making lives through connections.
So with that being said, I will give you an overview or an outline of what to expect during tonight's
presentation. We'll go over Title VI requirements, as well as agency alignment. We'll touch base on the
onboard survey demographics highlights. We'll get into the proposed Title VI policy changes, the results
of the service performance monitoring from 2022.
We'll cover down on the language access plan, the updated public participation plan, and then we'll end
with the outreach and public comment, as well as next steps. So as far as requirements overview, as set
forth by Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, it states that no person in the United States on the grounds
of race, color, or national origin be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subject
to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance. As a recipient of
federal assistance, RTD is required to comply with the Federal Transit Administration Circular 4702.1B.
And essentially, this provides the framework for adhering to the requirements as set forth and the
requirement to develop a Title VI program on a three-year cycle.
So I really want to ground us and take a moment on the governing board requirements. So first and
foremost, it's understanding the Title VI requirements as applied to public transit and service provision. As
we know, it's more than about providing basic service. The goal is to serve all of our populations as
efficiently and effectively as possible.
As we are in the people-moving business, there is great importance of not only focusing on service
delivery, but also ensuring these services meet the needs of all customer segments. Knowing that Black,
Indigenous, and People Of Color, i.e. BIPOC, and low-income populations, are generally more transitdependent or -reliant, and presumably most affected by decisions made by transit agencies, it is our
collective responsibility to ensure that we're leaning into the moment to make equitable and federally
compliant decisions.
Second bullet point that I want to highlight as the governing board is to review and approve program
elements. So the way this table is presented before you this evening is there's three columns. The first
column is review and approving policies and standards, first of which is our major service change policy,
which we'll cover down in just a moment.
The next is our disparate impact policy, which is centrally focused on race, ethnicity, or specifically Black,
Indigenous, people of color. The third is service standards and policies, which is also part of the board
packet. And the last item that we'll touch on as it relates to service and fare change is also
disproportionate burden policy.
I want to highlight the reason why it's an asterisk and italicized text is because low-income populations is
not a protected class under Title VI-- race, color, national origin. However, comma, as we know that more
folks are more likely to be transit-dependent and to ensure that we are more inclusive in the way that we
make decisions and we don't disproportionately burden, per the FTA circular guidance, low-income
populations is a customer segment that we need to ensure that we are not disproportionately or adversely
affecting. The second column under assessments is reviewing a demographic analysis, which we'll
present later today or this evening. And then results of service performance monitoring, which Martin
Romero will touch down later a little bit later in the presentation.
And then lastly is our outreach plans. We have our language access plan, which I'm very proud of. I was
very proud of the program plan-- or the language Access Plan that we produced back in 2022. This is
two, three, four steps in the right direction in ensuring that we are creating language access for our
linguistically diverse customers. And then we'll touch briefly on our public participation plan, which was a

collaborative effort led by our Communication and Engagement department, Stuart Summers and his
team, and specifically calling out Brandon Figliolino-- Legaliono-- whoops, Brandon F, I'll just say that,
and Gabriel Martinez.
So just to give an overview of the timeline of where we are this evening is there is a red box of the current
state of where we are at. So May 2025, it's centered on finalization of the Title VI program and adoption of
the RTD Board of Directors, which is being presented as a recommended action tonight. And moving
from right to left in the darker blue box is submitting the Title VI program to the FTA by June 1, ultimately
by June or May 30 since June 1 is a weekend.
But another item that I wanted to highlight here as we look at this graph in its entirety, it states that RTD
staff drafted changes to the Title VI program between July and December of 2024. That was just a
starting point. What I can say over these past three years, it was a path of progression, a lot of
assessment, a lot of meeting with community members along the way to right-size and refine this program
and elevate it in a way that honors that public feedback but also our expertise in conducting various types
of analyses, whether with respect to service changes and fare changes.
So I just want to highlight that then it's more than just about over this past six, seven months. It's been the
past three years. Or even before that when I initially came here in February 2021, and I had a meeting
with our general manager and CEO of the status of our Title VI program.
We are leaps and bounds of where we were in February 2021. And again, it's about building the
foundation because it's more than about notes on a page. It's really about the staff across the agencies,
across different business units, working hand in glove together and with community members. This is a
community-driven program to ensure that we're providing equitable transit services.
Now, I'll get into the onboard survey demographics as spelled out in the Board packet. RTD proceeded
with conducting a onboard or system-wide onboard transit customer survey dating back from August 19
to December 10, 2024. This was led by our planning department, specifically Lee Cryer as well as
consultants.
So we were able to garner data, ridership data over that time period to ensure that we are able to
supplement our American Community Survey data to round out the way that we conduct our service
equity analysis, truly emphasizing not just where people live, but also folks utilizing our transit services.
So it just strengthens-- it's another step in the right direction of strengthening the way that we conduct our
analysis and perform our data analysis. So looking at the demographics by race and ethnicity, and I want
to couch this as boardings.
During that time period when customers were surveyed, this is how more likely they were more likely to
board during that particular time period. So as the graphic or the pie chart shows before you here, it
shows that 56% of BIPOC, or Black, Indigenous, People Of Color, customers are more likely-- 56% more
likely than non-BIPOC customers at 44%. So if we rack and stack the difference between the 2019 to
2023 American Community Survey data, we can see that folks who boarded during that time period and
this data was weighted to get a better depiction of our customer base, it's well above that 38.2% data
point for BIPOC customers using Census data.
Next, I want to cover down on demographics by low-income populations at or below 150% of the federal
poverty level. Again, this is boardings where it shows that non-low-income customers, 67%, compared to
low-income customers at 33%. Although, we can see also, in addition to that, with the ACS, or American
Community Census, data or survey data that our service district average for low income is 14.1%. So this
is at or below 150% of the federal poverty level.
So now I want to get into demographics at or below 200% of the federal poverty level. We can see the
percentage increase of low income customers by increasing the threshold to 200% which we have heard

tonight through public comment. It's more representative of the cost of living in the Denver Metropolitan
area.
It looks at cost of living, affordable housing, so on and so forth. But we can see that 52% of low-income
customers at or below 200% compared to 48% of non-low-income customers. And in addition to the
Census data, that also had a percentage point increase from 14.1% to 20.3% for low income using the
Census data. So the reason why this is important to note-- and Martin will cover down on this a little bit
later as well-- as far as the justification of increasing and adopting the proposal to increase our threshold
to 200% of the federal poverty level.
Now I'll get into the proposed policies, specifically looking at the major service change policy, disparate
impact, disproportionate burden, and the fare equity policies. To ground us in a moment before I get into
actually explaining the current and the proposed policies, I want to also ground us in the requirements of
setting policy as far as our responsibility to comply with the FTA guidance. First and foremost is that we
must engage the public, our community members, our customers in the decision-making process. That is
part and parcel to ensure that we collect that feedback and honor what community members are saying.
From there, we are leveraging community feedback. We have conducted a desk audit research of
different-- or 22 different transit agencies. And knowing our expertise within the Transit Equity Office and
our relationships with various different agencies, it's about setting or establishing that major service
change policy and threshold, which is-- another key important part to that is defining the degree of
adverse effects.
So the second, in addition to setting a major service change policy, you're also measuring Disparate
Impact, or DI, and effects on BIPOC populations, which is innately or explicitly tied to Title VI. And then
the other is the disproportionate burden where we're assessing Disproportionate Burden, or DB, or the
effects on low-income populations where I noted earlier, it's not tied to Title VI. But we have this common
understanding that given our customer base and being more equitable and inclusive in the way in which
we assess impacts on our customer base, this is an important population to conduct this level of analysis.
Part of that is establishing the low income definition. That will ground truth, the way in which we measure,
and assess these potential impacts on these populations.
Now, I'll be getting into the major service change policy, which is truly about expanding and clarifying the
criteria in the way in which we are looking at service change recommendations. So just to give a
refresher, I know this was presented on a couple of different board presentations during service equity
analyses, but I just want to ground us in the moment of and really set the tone of what the major service
change policy is and what it is not. So as we look at this flow chart of the overview of the RTD analysis,
really focusing on major service change.
If you see at the bottom of the screen-- or I want to call out to the bottom of the screen, there is a note.
The equity analyses are completed following the receipt of service change recommendations or other
Comprehensive operations analysis, such as the system optimization plan. I want to highlight that
because whether it's our service development or other business units building out the service change
proposal or working in concert with our planning division, that proposal or that COA, or Comprehensive
Operations Analysis, is performed first. That's the starting gate. So there's actually a step zero, so to
speak.
Once that is completed, the Transit Equity Office works in concert with the service development and other
staff in planning to assess whether any of those proposed changes qualify. It's the gate. It's the
qualification of whether or not we are proceeding with step two, which is the evaluation of the possible
impacts. I won't continue on, but I just want to illustrate the point. The point that I want to make here is the
analysis is done after the proposal is put and presented to the board of directors.
Now let's look at the current major service change policy. So as we know, it is currently defined as a 25%
change plus or minus or an increase or a decrease in service hours on a route or line lasting greater than
12 or more months-- or 12-plus months. The adverse effect equates to a geographical or temporal

reduction in service that includes, but not limited to a route elimination or reductions, rerouting of an
existing route, increasing headways. And just to spell that a little bit more, it's the frequency in which our
buses are moving. So I just wanted to highlight that here.
So now let's take a look at the proposed major service change policy. We are recommending that it is any
25% change plus or minus in service hours in route miles, service span, which is the hours of operation
and frequency of a route or line. This also includes changes that are made one time or cumulatively over
that 36-month period. It also applies to the implementation, the elimination, retirement, discontinuing of a
route or line. And these are the proposed policy changes for the major service change policy.
What this screen here, it is a rack and stack of 16 and 17 and a side-by-side comparison of the current,
i.e. 2022 to 2025 Title VI program compared to the proposed major service change policies with respect
to major service change that we're proposing for 2025 to 2028. And the big call out here is specifically
delineating between BIPOC and low-income populations and the degree or the way in which what
dictates action or what does not dictate action if there is a finding of an adverse effect. So I just wanted to
call out there that low-income populations will be considered whereas there are other requirements which
we'll speak to a little bit later regarding disparate impact for BIPOC populations.
So now let's take a look at the policy goals for the major service change. So if we look at this table here
that is presented, we can look at the first column, which is policy elements. And I really want to focus on
the goal of each of the policy elements.
As we look at the "any 25% plus or minus service hours, route miles, service span, frequency," this is
really about providing a level of specificity and transparency to the type of change and the nature of
impact that it may have. We can see that or just from the current, where if you're just looking at service
hours, it doesn't necessarily give a depiction of the potential degree of impact whereas if we're comparing
route miles where you're removing stops compared to frequency or hours of operation, all of which can
have an impact on all of our customers, but we want to make sure that we are not creating an adverse
impact on BIPOC populations and as well as low-income populations.
The new route or line elimination of an existing route line. This is really about providing clarity and
alignment with the FTA circular of what is a major service change. This is explicitly spelled out in the
circular, but we just want to call it out into our particular program, so we provide that level of clarity. The
next is changes made over a 36-month period. Again, as we heard in the public comment, but just to
cover down on this particular goal that's spelled out here on the slide, it's really about providing a more
informed understanding of the degree of impact over time with knowing that we make three service
change recommendations a year where we want to be able to discern that level or the degree of impact
over that 36-month period if it reaches that 25% threshold, which, essentially, it allows for Better
balancing and achievement of equitable service distribution.
And then lastly, the adverse effect, we can see that it's any impact on transit services resulting from major
service changes that disproportionately impacts BIPOC populations, and low-income populations will be
considered. Again, here, the goal is to provide clarity to the degree of impact between the comparator
groups, whether we're looking at BIPOC compared to non-BIPOC populations or low-income compared to
non-BIPOC populations. But this establishes that baseline for the equity analysis to discern, what is the
degree of impact?
It's already tied to our previous adverse effect. But this is more so to clarify and to level set in the way in
which we conduct our analysis. So I want to get into a couple of different questions.
So what do these major service change policies mean in practice? So one question that I would pose is,
would this new policy qualify more route lines changes as major service changes? Before I answer this
question directly, as we rewind back and think about the intent and purpose of the Title VI program, and
what we have a collective responsibility to do is at least take the opportunity to examine, to assess
whether or not this is a major service change, and to understand the degree of impacts on the types of
changes.

So specifically, I want to call out here is it's contingent upon circumstances. It doesn't necessarily mean
that it will or it will not. But as an example, if we look at the implementation or the changes that are going
to be implemented on May 15, 2025, we know that the route 19, which serves the North Pecos, Civic
Center, Station 206 and Melody.
It will extend the connection from the N lines North Glenn and 112th Avenue Station. And then we also
have the Route 228, Lafayette, Louisville, Broomfield, where it serves the US 36, and Flatirons Station to
Forest Park and Arapahoe. And it's adjusting the Route 228 to serve the new Superior Downtown
Development. And it's a reroute of the northern segment via Dagny Way from 95th street.
I wanted to showcase the example and what the changes will be once it's implemented, but also call out
the population. We can see for the route 19 that the demographics around that particular route is 68%
BIPOC and 66% low income for the route 19. We also see with the Route 228, 228A. It's 97% nonBIPOC, 97% non-low-income.
As I noted earlier in the presentation, this is truly about-- the goal's about serving all of our populations as
effectively and efficiently. And it's assessing not only-- it's not providing preference one over the other. It's
assessing it for all of our customers to ensure that we are, again, distributing our services as equitably as
possible. So I just wanted to call that to the board of directors' attention and clarify that particular
question.
Now I'll get into the next question that we'd like to pose is, would this proposed policy prevent RTD from
making major service changes? The quick answer to that is not necessarily. And I wanted to give a
couple of different examples, but first, I will bring everyone's attention to the table on the far right of the
screen. And I'll also highlight that visually-- or verbally.
We can see, on the left side of this table, there's major changes. And then on the right side-- or the
second column is minor changes. From January 2023 to the May 2025 service change implementations,
we had about 247 changes. Only 26% were considered major service changes, which necessitated an
analysis for-- moving forward with an equity analysis to assess impacts on BIPOC populations and lowincome populations.
I do also want to call out the couple of different examples that we have here on the screen. The first one
is the 12 potential Disparate Impact findings, or DI findings. I will call out that, although it resulted in a
potential DI finding, all of the changes were implemented.
It did require that we provided a substantial legitimate justification, as well as take the opportunity to
mitigate or avoid any potential impacts. However, comma, staff recommended that we still proceed
because as we look at our service as a whole in its entirety, holistically, and what it represents for the
communities that we serve, we still recommended with approving the analysis even though there was
potential disparate impact finding, but we did meet the substantial legitimate justification. I also want to
call out the second example is the three potential disproportionate burdens. These were considerations.
But as we think about what the Title VI program stands for, it's about ensuring that we don't get too far
over our skis, and we're not creating adverse effects on populations that are more likely to be transitreliant or transit-dependent, but it's also a nod or looking collectively at all of our customers. Other factors
I mentioned in the previous slide with the flowchart of the decision flowchart of when we conducted equity
analysis, it's not just Title VI is one component out of many different factors that we look into as far as
putting forth our service change recommendations. We all are well aware of the guiding principles,
service development guiding principles, which looks at service change considerations, and evaluations,
whether looking at resource availability, whether that is our monetary or thinking about operators or our
bus operators.
And then the Title VI component goes into the regulatory. But we also have contractual requirements. So
I just wanted to call that to attention.

So lastly, before I pass this on, I did want to close with the Title VI application centered around service
equity. We are well-aware of the data analysis, the data sources that we utilize. It was primarily focused
on the American Community Survey, which is population data, which is one that is strongly recommended
by the Federal Transit Administration.
And it's the best available data. But in addition to that, the secondary data source that we utilize is
customer surveys. Previously as I mentioned that we just recently conducted an onboard customer
survey.
We now have the capability to be able to conduct our service equity analysis with utilizing ridership data.
Again, this is a step in the right direction. It's a path to progression as we look at the various tools or data
sources that we can utilize that is accurate, that's reliable, that has a level of validity to ensure that we are
conducting this analysis with a level of statistical significance.
I will also share that, when we think about BIPOC populations, the Title VI program is really about
ensuring that they receive a fair share of benefits from service increases, and that BIPOC populations are
not unfairly burdened by service reductions, and knowing-- which is another step in the right direction that
the board adopted in 2022 as part of the 2022-2025 Title VI program, where we heard the community
loud and clear-- is that we are also continuing on with our assessment to access to key activity centers.
And that is looking at grocery stores, academic institutions, social services, senior housing, and places of
employment. So it's not just where people live, it's also assessing where people are going.
And then now, since we have the latest and greatest onboard survey, we are now-- be able to utilize
ridership data as part of our service equity analysis. So with that being said, I will now pass it over to
Martin Romero, Trans Equity manager.
MARTIN ROMERO: Thank you, Carl. Good evening, Board Chair and Board of Directors. So following the
proposed major service change policy, we have an update to the disproportionate burden policy with a
change in the definition of low-income households by raising the threshold from 150% to 200% of the
federal poverty level. Next slide, please.
So currently, a household is classified as low income if its total combined income, meaning the income of
all individuals living in that household, is at or below 150% of the federal poverty level. We are proposing
to raise the threshold to 200% to better align with the cost of living in the Denver region. This change is
important because it comports with the results of the 2024 onboard survey results, which indicates that a
high proportion of RTD customers are more likely to be at this poverty level.
The board's consideration and approval to increase to 200% will allow a more comprehensive and
inclusive evaluation of equity impacts on low-income individuals and families. In turn, this will ensure our
services meets the needs of all populations and individuals by being adept, responsive, and sensitive to
our customer needs. To the right here, you see a chart from the US Department of Health and Human
Services that outlines the income threshold used to define low-income households based on household-excuse me, on household size.
So, for example, under the current policy, a single-person household earning up to 23,475 qualifies as
low income. Sorry, Carl, you're covering the slides with the other one. You can stay on this slide.
And with the proposed increase to 200% of the federal poverty level, that threshold would rise to 31,300.
And likewise, a household of four currently qualifies as low income if their income is 48,225 or less. Under
the proposed change, that threshold would increase to 64,300. Next slide, please.
So fare equity policy the proposed change here is to provide clarification of what constitutes a fare
change and when an equity analysis would be required. Next slide.

Our current policy is designed to ensure that fare changes do not disproportionately burden BIPOC or
low-income customers compared to the overall ridership. So specifically, any fare price change or
averages of multiple fare changes must not negatively impact BIPOC by more than 5%. In addition to fare
pricing, the policy also addresses fare payment methods. For example, if a payment method such as
passive electronic payments, vending machines or online options are changed or discontinued, RTD
conducts an inequity analysis to assess how these changes may affect customers access to fare options.
Next slide, please.
So the proposed policy builds on the current foundation and adds clarity to the types of fare changes, as
well as improved clarity on what constitutes a fare change. So as mentioned, we are replacing minority
with BIPOC. The proposed definition expands the scope to include any changes in fare prices, types of
fare medium, for example, cash or electronic payments, fare products, like the day of the monthly pass.
Different fare levels, like standard versus airport pricing. Customer categories, like senior and youth. And
then access to ticket vending machines, so specifically payment options or fees. And the goal here is to
clearly define when an equity analysis is required for fare changes and to assess how those changes
might impact BIPOC and low-income customers. Next slide, please.
So moving on to the 2022 service performance monitoring report. This section here focuses on how we
compare service performance metrics across RTD system. Specifically, we look at how service levels and
quality differ between BIPOC and non-BIPOC populations, as well as between low-income and non-lowincome populations. And this helps us ensure that our service delivery is equitable and identify any
potential disparities that may need to be addressed. Next slide, please.
So to measure and compare the six performance metrics, we first identify and classify each route and
line, stop, and station as BIPOC or non-BIPOC and also low-income or non-low-income. And this
classification is done using ACS Census demographic data. And once the routes and stops are
categorized, we can analyze the six metrics.
So stop amenities measures the availability of features such as shelters, seating, lighting, elevators, and
trash receptacles at every stop and station. Vehicle loads, tracks overcrowding during peak hours, and it
focuses on improving passenger comfort and operational efficiency. On-time performance evaluates the
percentage of trips arriving within the defined time window to ensure trust and reliability in our transit
system.
And then vehicle assignment assesses the average age of the fleet and ensures that newer, safer, and
more reliable vehicles are distributed equally or equitably across demographic groups. And then revenue
hours examines the distribution of service hours across different areas to promote equity and address
underserved communities. And then, finally, service availability measures how accessible transit options
are to the population and enhancing inclusivity for diverse groups. Next slide, please.
OK, so the 2021 through 2026 strategic plan rating scale aims to ensure equity by evaluating the
performance metrics of BIPOC and low-income routes and lines compared to their non-BIPOC and nonlow-income income counterparts. So the goal is for BIPOC and low income metrics to be within 10% of
their comparator group. And then metrics exceeding 10% but within 20% receive a caution score. And
this highlights areas for improvement.
Those over 20% indicate adverse impacts, and that triggers a finding of disparate impact per FTA
guidelines. And as Carl noted earlier, low-income populations are not a protected class under Title VI.
However, RTD includes low-income as a consideration as part of the assessment.
And the assessment can be referenced in the board packet pages, 1,072 to 1,090. So for the purpose of
tonight's presentation, we'll focus on the results comparing BIPOC versus non-BIPOC lines and routes in
alignment with the FTA guidance. Next slide, please.

So the results for stop amenities shows promising outcomes. There are no potential disparities observed
between BIPOC and non-BIPOC stops and stations as all locations achieve the performance difference
within that 10% threshold or better. As we can see in the chart, key amenities such as seating, lighting,
shelters, and waste receptacles are consistently on par across both comparator groups, reflecting an
equitable distribution.
Next slide, please. So examining the other five performance metrics between BIPOC and non-BIPOC
routes and lines reveal that four out of the five metrics are on target with no potential disparities observed.
However, the revenue hours metric indicates a caution finding as BIPOC bus routes receive 14.2% fewer
revenue hours compared to the non-BIPOC counterparts, 43.9% versus 57.1%.
And so this marginal score flags revenue hours as an area for improvement. And it highlights the need for
adjustments to ensure equitable service distribution for local and regional routes. One thing I do want to
clarify is the N/A you see on the chart for vehicle assignment. This is because all 66 RTD commuter rail
vehicles were purchased in 2014, and therefore there is no difference in the average age of commuter rail
vehicles between BIPOC and non-BIPOC lines. Next slide, please.
OK, so to recap, the service performance metrics for BIPOC and BIPOC transit modes reveal several key
findings across all six performance metrics. No adverse impacts were identified which demonstrates
overall equity in service distribution. Most metrics perform as well or better on BIPOC routes compared to
non-BIPOC counterparts, aligning with established equity thresholds.
However, the revenue hours metric highlighted a caution finding for BIPOC bus routes. BIPOC routes
receive 14.2% fewer revenue hours, 43.8 compared to nine non-BIPOC routes at 57.1, and this resulted
in a caution area score. So this discrepancy underscores the need for further improvement to ensure
equitable service allocation across all routes.
Additionally, system-wide observations showed that BIPOC transit modes receive 45.2% of total revenue
hours, compared to 54.7% for non-BIPOC modes. And although this 9.5% difference is within the
acceptable range, it approaches that close 10% threshold. And this is an area that warrants ongoing
monitoring and attention to maintain equity in service hours. Next slide, please.
So let's go ahead and move on to our language access plan, which ensures compliance with Title VI by
providing translated materials, interpretation services, and accessible signage to enable equitable access
for non-English speakers. And so these efforts support individuals with limited English proficiency and
foster inclusivity and breaks down communication barriers across RTD services and programs. Next slide.
OK, so RTD's 2025 to 2028 language access plan complies with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act and the
FTA circular 4702.1B. It incorporates a four-factor analysis to evaluate language needs and resources.
And this analysis evaluates four key factors.
So factor 1 is the number of linguistically diverse individuals eligible to be served or likely to encounter
RTD services. Factor 2 is the frequency of interactions between these individuals and RTD programs,
activities, and services. And then factor 3 is the importance of RTD services to this population.
And then factor 4 is the resources available and the cost associated with providing language assistance.
And so insights from this evaluation inform the language access measures or the implementation
calendar, which ensures timely and effective execution of initiatives. Next slide, please.
So let's cover key results from our four-factor analysis. So RTD service area includes a Limited English
Proficiency, LEP, populations of over 200,000 individuals, accounting for 6.8% of the total population who
speak English less than very well.
And among these, Spanish is the most commonly spoken language at 65.4% followed by Vietnamese at
4.7% and Chinese at 3.9%. And so to ensure compliance with federal language access requirements, we

have identified 19 safe harbor languages, including Spanish, Vietnamese, Chinese, Swahili, Arabic, and
Russian, among others. Next slide, please.
OK, so the survey results highlight significant insights into language access and barriers within RTD
service area. For example, from the frontline staff survey, 662 surveys were completed. 66% Of staff
reported near-daily interactions with linguistically diverse customers, with 86% of these encounters
occurring in person at buses or stations.
However, 70% of staff expressed challenges in communication, marking an increase of 57% from 2021.
So from the Community Survey, 578 survey responses were completed and were conducted in 14
languages from December 30, 2024 through February 2, 2025. 70% of participants stated frequent use of
buses and 61% reported not having access to a household vehicle.
Notably, 29% indicated that language barriers limit their transit use, and additionally, the majority of
respondents are unfamiliar with applying for discounts or reporting concerns, using next ride, or
accessing customer care, which suggests gaps in outreach or awareness. And you can find the full
results of the four-factor analysis in attachment F of the Title VI program. Next slide, please.
Getting into the public participation plan, which was, as Carl mentioned, primarily developed by the
Communications and Engagement Team in partnership with an inter-division work group. And it serves as
a framework for how RTD engages with the community, with a special focus on fostering meaningful
interactions with historically underserved populations. The plan underscores RTD's commitment to
inclusivity and equitable participation in its programs and initiatives. Next slide, please.
So RTD's updated public participation plan strengthens community centered outreach to historically
underserved populations while ensuring compliance with Title VI and the FTA Circular 4702.1B. The plan
incorporates intentional strategies to engage with BIPOC and linguistically diverse communities, as well
as communities of persons with disabilities and in the decision-making process. And this aligns with
federal mandates and equity commitments. It also emphasizes collaboration with community-based
organizations to amplify underserved voices. It prioritizes transparent communication to foster trust in the
community, and it integrates public feedback into transit policies to demonstrate its impact.
Lessons learned from the 2022 public participation plan, as well as taking some pieces from agencies like
WMATA and LA Metro inform these updates, advancing RTD's mission for inclusive and equitable
engagement. Next slide, please.
OK, so in accordance with FTA guidelines, RTD is required to promote inclusive public participation,
ensure meaningful access for individuals with limited English proficiency, and use appropriate methods to
gather public input when developing or updating our Title VI program before Board approval. And so to
meet these requirements, we implemented a comprehensive outreach strategy to collect feedback on the
proposed policy updates and the full Title VI program as well in our public engagement efforts. So this
ensures alignment with federal standards. Next slide, please.
So as mentioned, we implemented a robust outreach strategy to promote public participation in the
proposed Title VI program updates. A news release was issued on April 7, 2025, and that provided
comprehensive details on the changes and explained how the public could get involved. Engagement
was encouraged through RTD's Read-n-Ride publication distributed on April 21, 2025 to spotlight
participation opportunities.
A centralized web page was also created to outline the proposed updates and allowing individuals to
submit comments on specific sections of the entire program. And then between April 28 and May 14, RTD
promoted engagement opportunities through organic posts, social posts on the agency social media
channels, as well as through paid advertisements. Our partners, such as the Asian Roundtable of
Colorado and the Mexican Cultural Center, also shared information on their social media platforms.

Additionally, we sent a blast email to over 1,000 community-based organizations and direct service
providers within the service area to ensure widespread awareness for all. Next slide, please.
OK, so we also prioritized direct community engagement through in-person participation at key events in
April and May, including Día del Niño, Future Fest, as well as Globeville Springfest, and planned
attendance at the AAPI Culture Fest as well. And these events offered the public an opportunity to
interact with RTD staff, ask questions, and provide feedback. Additionally, RTD collaborated with
community-based organization contractors who conducted direct outreach, engaging with over 500
BIPOC and low-income individuals at four events and who are still continuing to promote the program
update through their socials, newsletters, and in-person events and other means.
And to expand its reach, we leveraged existing programs such as the LIVE income-based fare program
and the Transit Assistance Grant program to reach our organizations serving individuals with immediate
needs and directly connect with BIPOC and low-income communities. We shared the program update
with 150 organizations who are recipients of the TAG program.
We also attempted to gather feedback through the LIVE income-based fare program and send
information via email to over 12,000 active customers, which was opened by over 8,500 customers. That
was an open rate of 43.3%. Our public relations department, who also assisted by sending the
information on the stakeholders update newsletter to over 28,000 subscribers, and that had an open rate
of 40%. Next slide, please.
OK, so to cover outreach results comprehensively, as of May 1, 2025, we completed 10 events with a
total of 1,600 attendees. We completed five presentations with 150-plus attendees, direct emails to over
12,000 active LIVE customers, and 150 TAG program recipients received the information. We
disseminated a news release on January 2 in relation to the proposed policy updates to 672 subscribers,
achieving a 35% open rate. One more Read-n-Ride article was also released on May 9, and that reached
979 subscribers with a 43% open rate.
The board can reference board packet pages 105 to 110 to read the more detailed community
engagement efforts. Additionally, the board can refer to attachment Y of the program update or board
packet pages 1,092 through 1,095 for comments integrated thus far. So can we go one slide back, Carl?
Thank you.
So continuing on public overall outreach and public comment results, Read-n-Ride was also sent out on
January 9 to nearly 1,000 subscribers. Opened by 547 subscribers, a rate of 59%. Another news release
encompassing the full Title VI program was released on April 7, which reached the inboxes of 712
subscribers with an open rate of 36%.
A Spanish news release was also sent out to multicultural contracts, reaching 102 inboxes, with an open
rate of 47%. To date, we've done over 100 public survey responses counting the Title VI policy update
responses, and the full Title VI program responses as well. We've also received 2,700 total website
views, but actually, the updated number for this that I received today was over 7,200 website views. And
that's as of today.
So we are generating traffic and feedback. And we will continue to do so for the next week. The organic
RTD post received 9,700 impressions, with an engagement rate of 3.3%. And also to speak a little bit
more on the paid ads, so between April 28 and May 14, RTD's paid ad campaign delivered 240,000
impressions, making it one of the most visible engagement efforts during that period.
The overall click through rate, which includes all forms of interaction with that, with the ad, not just link
clicks, was 2.9% which is notably high, indicating strong engagement for the ad. The click-through rate for
link clicks to the website alone was 1.2%, reflecting continued interest in learning more about the program
update. And then engagement on the Meta platforms was particularly strong. The ads generated over
3,000 clicks and had 119 comments.

The 119 comments reflected a mix of feedback. However, the staff are still currently reviewing the
comments as many of the comments made were not in relation to the Title VI program update. Rather,
they focused on the artwork or other unrelated matters. Next slide, please.
OK, so the FTA requires RTD's board of directors to review, consider, and approve the full Title VI
program update, including all policies and the service monitoring results. This approval must be secured
by May 28, 2025 in order to meet federal compliance requirements. And once approved, RTD will submit
the finalized version to the FTA by June 1 or a little before June 30 since that is a weekend. And so timely
approval ensures RTD remains in compliance with federal regulations and reaffirms the agency's
commitment to advancing equity and inclusion for all customers.
I think that concludes our presentation. Next slide, please. Yeah, that concludes our presentation. And
now we'll open it up for any questions now.
JOYANN RUSCHA: Thank you so much. That was wonderful. I would us to take a brief pause here, and I
have a special guest to introduce.
There are a lot of folks on my screen, but I do believe that-- ah, there she is. My councilwoman, Shontel
Lewis, has joined us this evening. Now, Councilwoman Lewis was previously engaged in another matter
and couldn't make it for public comment.
So we're going to give some space for her to speak tonight. And for those of you who are not aware,
Councilwoman Lewis is also my predecessor. A handful of years ago, I ran for this seat and rightfully got
my butt kicked and happily voted for her. As she moved on to city council, and she does an excellent job.
And I am so proud to introduce my predecessor and my friend, Councilwoman Shontel Lewis.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Thank you so much.
JOYANN RUSCHA: You are recognized. Please take it away.
SHONTEL M. LEWIS: I really appreciate it. And my dearest apologies for being late. I did have another
engagement. As you all know, the work never stops. And I appreciate the opportunity to provide some
public comment.
And so thank you, Chair Ruscha and the members of the Operations Committee. Thank you for the
opportunity to speak and thank you to the directors and the RTD staff for such thoughtful legislation. My
name is Shontel M. Lewis, and I proudly represent Denver's District 8, which includes East Colfax,
Montbello, Northeast, Park Hill, Northfield, and Central Park.
Prior to my time on the RTD Board, I actually served as the transit equity specialist in the RTD planning
department. So I'm quite familiar with Title VI, and I'm grateful to see the agency moving in this direction
to expand major service change, low income definition, and fare equity, which will result in better
outcomes for those that rely on our services. During my time in Title VI-- this was back in 2016-- Michael
Washington and I were working to change the federal poverty level from 152% to 200% of the federal
poverty level.
So it's very exciting that almost 10 years ago we were having this discussion, and here we are in 2025,
where you all are actually doing the work, committing to the work and getting it done. And so I could not
be more proud. And while better late than never-- but never late is better. Don't forget that-- I do hope we
continue to move in this direction to hold this agency to a different standard that really benefits our riders.
A standard that not only considers the process but centers the people, their experiences, their lives, and
their struggles. Today is deeply personal for me, not just as a policymaker, but as someone who has lived
the realities we often talk about in these rooms, those that are dependent on public transportation, those

that scrape up change daily to afford the rides for our services, those that rely on daily tips to ensure they
have food on their tables. And they rely on you all for your services to ensure that.
And so this policy brings those from the bus stops to the board rooms-- and you all know who I got that
from-- that are often impacted by our decisions and rarely decision-makers on the decisions that impact
their lives. This policy changes that. It gives communities that are often burdened by policies, especially
communities of color and low-income communities a seat at the table.
And you all are asking the right question, who stands to benefit? And who stands to be burdened from
policy service, from fare change decisions? And I thank you for prioritizing people over politics, over
procedures, over policies. That's what it's about.
And I would be remiss to not come on behalf of 13 members of Denver City Council who wanted to also
thank you all for moving in this direction. And we were able to move a proclamation forward that is
cosponsored by all 13 council members, which is no easy feat because we don't agree on a lot of things.
And so with that, thank you so much for the opportunity to speak and for being flexible in your time to
allow me to do so. Thank you.
JOYANN RUSCHA: Thank you, Councilwoman. I don't have a finer follow up. And so with that, I think this
would be a good time to go for a break.
We generally break around 7:30, and I see that Director Nicholson has his hand up. So, Director
Nicholson, I will recognize you first when we return. But again, we do offer a 10-minute break to give our
transcriptionist, staff, and our community time to rest and recharge.
And so with that, we are recessed for 10 minutes at 7:22. And we will return at 7:32 PM. I will see you
shortly.
OK, friends. Thank you and welcome back. It is 7:33 PM, and we have returned from recess.
Before we recessed, I did note that Director Nicholson had his hand up. And so we will go ahead and
recognize him first. Thank you, sir, for being patient.
You have the floor. Director Harwick will start the clock. And again, if you hear that ding, just a cue to
wrap it up.
We're not going to yank you back with a cane or anything. Ready when you are, sir. Go ahead.
CHRIS NICHOLSON: Thank you. So I really appreciated both the process that staff went through in
educating us on this. It was a big, meaty topic that took me a while to wrap my head around. I think a lot
of us got a lot more comfortable with what was in this very, very long document as a result of that.
I also want to acknowledge the really impressive work in the language access policy that's in there. I was
particularly impressed by how thoughtful that was. I come from a place with a lot of Spanish speakers and
seeing us making significant progress on not just with Spanish, but all of the other languages spoken in
the metro area. I think it's super important.
I really just have a simple question that come up as I've really thought through a lot of this over the last
couple of weeks. The policy that's being proposed today would raise the FPL definition for
disproportionate burden to 200%. But for our LIVE program, we set that number at 250%.
And I guess I wanted you guys to explain, why are we not setting the same definition for disproportionate
burden that we are for LIVE? Why are we setting two different levels of low income, basically? So that's
my one question,

CARL GREEN JR.: Director Ruscha, if I may.
JOYANN RUSCHA: I was on mute. Yes, Mr. Green, go ahead. Thank you.
CARL GREEN JR.: Yes, thank you so much. Director Nicholson, thank you so much for the question. So
a couple different items that I wanted to highlight with respect to the reason why we are proceeding or
why we propose with 200% compared to the 250% at or below the federal poverty level.
First and foremost, it specifically has to do with the availability of data from the American Community
Survey or the Census data where the threshold goes to-- the highest that we can go is 200% and then the
next one after that, given their markers, is 300%. So it's centered on the availability of data whereas we
think about with the LIVE program, our income-based program, it's at the 250% level, which we raised as
part of the system-wide fare study from 185% to 250% because it's really about means-based testing,
where we have programs such as SNAP and other means-based testing to be able to allow us to
increase it to that 250%. So they're separate because of the availability of data. But the way in which folks
qualify for the LIVE program is a different repository of data or information to say it succinctly.
JOYANN RUSCHA: Thank you, Mr. Green. So I just want to make sure-- I'm trying to check for
understanding. I think that Director Nicholson raised a really good question, and I think I mentioned
something a couple years ago when we were voting on our new fare structure to this effect. So I just
learned a lot in the last 30 seconds.
So if I understand what you said, it's that we can go from 200 or 300, but there's not a way for us to pick
the 250%. We have to go one-- is that what I understood?
CARL GREEN JR.: Yes, Chair Ruscha, it only goes at or below 200% or above 200% So the threshold, it
goes from under 50% to at or below-- and there's 50 to 0.99, 150%, 1.5 or 185%. It goes to at or below
200%, and then it drops off after that where you can go to 300, but there's no 250% is essentially what I'm
saying.
JOYANN RUSCHA: OK, thank you. And again, I think this was a great question. And we all just learned a
lot.
So if there's any other member of staff who would like to address this, I will definitely-- I'm looking around.
I don't see hands raised. But Director Nicholson, did you have a follow-up? Or can we pass the baton.
And then we'll circle back and let you chew on what we just learned.
CHRIS NICHOLSON: I do have a very quick follow-up on a technical level, just because I was a little
confused. Is that OK?
JOYANN RUSCHA: Yeah, absolutely.
CHRIS NICHOLSON: I was just wondering because I did look into this over the last couple of days in
terms of how these are getting set. And it's my understanding that transit agencies have a number of
different measures by which they set their disproportionate burden level. A lot of them do use FPL.
Some of them have just a straight dollar amount. Boston uses 60% of AMI. So I guess my question would
be, are we really prohibited from setting that number to something other than just 150, 200, or 300?
Could we set a dollar amount? Could we set it to AMI? Could we set it to something else and be in
compliance?
CARL GREEN JR.: Chair Ruscha, if I may?
JOYANN RUSCHA: Yeah, absolutely, Mr. Green.

CARL GREEN JR.: Yes, Director Nicholson, that is a great question. One, to your point with respect to
different transit agencies, and one item that I wanted to highlight is in our desk audit of 22 different transit
agencies. There were four that had at or below 200%.
There was one that had at or below 185%. And the remaining 17 was at 150% or 100%. The specific data
which allows us-- and it's the best available data that we have knowing that it's a path to progression and
ensuring that we have the best available data to inform the level of analysis that we need to conduct, we
specifically use table C17002, which is the ratio of income to poverty level. And those are the thresholds
that we utilize.
To your question or your comment, with respect-- it doesn't preclude an agency from using AMI. But what
I will say is, similar to other questions with respect to automatic passenger counters or other available
data, we just need to ensure that we are moving in the direction where we have the available data that
provides that level of consistency, accuracy, validity, and reliability to the way in which we conduct the
analysis. So because we have this data, the table that I mentioned, that is why we are using it for now.
But as I think about future or other opportunities as we build out the other different data sources that we
can supplement, this time period provides the opportunity, over this next three years, to be able to collect
that data and look at other means to assess. And I just wanted to call it out just with respect to the Title VI
program overall is it's really centered on race, color, national origin, Title VI protected class, Where, even
per the Title VI Circular where low-income populations is a consideration and just knowing the amount of
resources or people power, we would like to move in that direction. But we want to make sure that we
have the available data to be able to conduct that level of analysis using other different data sources,
such as AMI and so forth.
JOYANN RUSCHA: Thank you, Mr. Green. I also want to recognize our General Manager and CEO, Ms.
Debra Johnson. Ms. Johnson, you have the floor.
DEBRA JOHNSON: Yes, thank you very much to Ruscha and Secretary Nicholson. Thanks for your
questions. And, Mr. Green, thanks for your thorough response.
At this juncture, what I would offer up to the committee, what I believe would be more prudent,
recognizing Secretary Nicholson has asked some very thoughtful questions. Relative to this and what we
could do going forward, i believe it's incumbent upon us to do our due diligence. So I'd be more than
happy to work in conjunction with my team to provide a written communication in the form of a
memorandum, as I generally do, to ask-- excuse me, to answer these questions in greater specificity, as
opposed to doing it in the form in which we're doing because something could get lost in translation.
Please recognize that I support the notion on the face of it, but recognizing our responsibility, I want to
ensure, as we go forward, that we have provided you with accurate information where we can cite
different aspects of the FTA circular or any other pertinent information for committee members. So thank
you. I had my hand up before. You just didn't see me, and I let Carl go. All right.
JOYANN RUSCHA: I apologize, Ms. Johnson. Thank you for your grace. So with that, I'm going to go
ahead and recognize Director Chandler, who's been waiting patiently.
And then I feel like there might be some additional comment on this topic, and we'll definitely circle back
and figure out a path forward to ensure that we're all sufficiently informed. So, Director Chandler, thank
you for your patience. You are recognized.
KATHLEEN CHANDLER: Thank you, Chair Ruscha. Thank you very much. I appreciate this as well. This
has been a very thoughtful presentation. That actually was my question, where is low income also defined
within RTD and how is that across the Board?

Because I do think that having a consistent definition would help the agency over the long term. And so if
there is a disparity, how can we, over time, maybe not tonight, obviously, but over time, fix that?
Therefore, my question has really been asked and answered.
My other question, since I have the floor, is on page-- I think it was page 19 of the presentation. You were
talking specifically about that 36 months and going over that time frame instead of just 12-month period.
Do you suspect that those compliance numbers or the disproportionate impact would go up or down
based on that time frame?
Or is it just because we want something to compare it to? I just was wondering. I mean, I get why you're
doing it, but I just want to know if you think that it would either go up or down based on that extensive time
frame addition from 12 months to 36 months?
CARL GREEN JR.: Chair Ruscha, if I may?
JOYANN RUSCHA: Absolutely, proceed.
CARL GREEN JR.: So great question, Director Chandler. So the intent purpose of the 36 month is to, as
noted, with three service change recommendations on an annual basis and looking at even over a threeyear time period. Let's say, for example, there was a change made to a particular route or line this coming
August of 2025, and it was 15% where it could be a change of-[LAUGHING]

Dramatic effect.
CHRIS NICHOLSON: My bad, sorry about that.
JOYANN RUSCHA: I love that music. It's like Disney or Star Wars.
CHRIS NICHOLSON: My bad.
JOYANN RUSCHA: Please proceed, Mr. Green.
CARL GREEN JR.: Yeah, so let's say, for example, in the August service change recommendation, there
was a change to a particular route, and it was 15%. With the existing, it wouldn't meet the major service
change threshold, but knowing that it could have potential impacts, but we're not necessarily looking at it
right now because it would be a minor change. But knowing that it's impacting our customers good, bad,
or indifferent, whether it's an increase or decrease-- but let's say, for example, in January of 2026, the
service change recommendations, it's another 15%. So that's a 30% change in revenue-- or not revenue,
route miles or span or frequency.
So what this particular 36-month cumulative addition or proposed addition is to say, we know we've made
a couple of different changes. We're doing our best with all the different considerations of the service
development guidelines, resources, et cetera. It's us as an agency to be able to take a step back to better
understand the nature of impacts over time, knowing that it impact it could have an impact on our writers.
I couldn't necessarily tell you that it would increase or decrease the number, but again, it's just they-- the
step zero, so to speak, is the service change recommendation. And then the step one is, did it meet a
major service change? So it provides that collective responsibility to say, OK, we're making changes
periodically. Is there a potential impact where we're the going in a direction where we need to ensure that
we're providing that mitigation or substantial legitimate justification?

But as I noted, over the past-- since January 2023, we've had a number of different potential disparate
impacts and disproportionate burdens. There were still staff in consult with community members, still were
able to mitigate those impacts for various reasons. And we had the substantial legitimate justification. So
it's just more so a check in the bag to say, are we assessing the true intent of what we're responsible
under the Title VI program.
JOYANN RUSCHA: Thank you, Mr. Green. Director Chandler, does that satisfy your question for now?
KATHLEEN CHANDLER: To a certain extent. I guess, I mean, you can't, obviously, predict whether it's
going to go up or down, but I guess if you didn't find a disparate impact in the first 12 months, or if you did
and it didn't happen again in this second set, what would determine-- is it a ratio of over the whole 36
months?
I guess, I'm just trying to figure out-- I get why you're doing it. I'm just trying to figure out if you can predict
whether or not that's going to make a big difference in how it's-- because over time things fluctuate so
much. I was just trying to mull that over what we could glean from that additional time frame.
JOYANN RUSCHA: Thank you, Director Chandler. So, Mr. Green, if you have any additional comments
to that, I'll let you go ahead and address.
If not, I will go ahead and recognize Director Paglieri and then Director Chandler. We will make sure that
if that question which is a really good one-- and it's a meaty one-- isn't addressed by the end of our
discussion tonight, that staff, we'll definitely follow up with you in the interim before our "end of the month"
board meeting. Mr. Green, do you have any additional comments?
CARL GREEN JR.: I see that our GM CEO Johnson has her hand raised.
JOYANN RUSCHA: I apologize. Gosh, I'm 0 for 2. Ms. Johnson, thank you for your grace. Please.
DEBRA JOHNSON: Thank you, Committee Chair Ruscha. And thank you very much, Director Chandler,
for the question. To the point that Mr. Green raises, it's more or less difficult to ascertain what would
happen over the course of three years, recognizing when you look at land use and other travel patterns
and travel sheds and things of the like, there could be a shift just naturally with different elements that
happen. Hence, that's why a comprehensive operational analysis is so critically important, and there is a
clear-cut nexus going forward.
As it relates to the 36-month period, the reason why we are doing it in this fashion is so we can, for lack of
a better term, look at it in a holistic fashion where we are mitigating any unexpected adverse impacts. But
it is very difficult to, more or less, provide an answer in the manner in which you're seeking relative to
what that may look like. So I just wanted to provide that context.
As I've looked and been a part of a myriad of service changes over the course of my career and quite
naturally, leveraging the aspects of disparate impact and things of the like. I just wanted to offer that up to
say, we're not trying to skirt response to you, but it would be very difficult to be able to foresee what that
can be. But we are optimistic that this would yield a greater benefit to all and minimize the potential of
adverse impacts that would come in a segmented fashion. So I just wanted to offer that up. Thank you.
JOYANN RUSCHA: Thank you, ma'am. And with that, I see Director Paglieri. Thank you for being patient.
You are hereby recognized. Take it away.
BRETT PAGLIERI: Thank you, Chair. This is Director Paglieri. I just want to start off with some thank
yous. Thank you, Mr. Green.

Thank you, Mr. Green. Thank you, Mr. Romero. And thank you, CEO and General Manager Johnson. For
the hard work you've put into this, but also for answering questions and providing opportunities for
feedback and learning.
I have learned a lot since our previous meeting on this, and that's thanks to you guys and the time that
you spent with me. And so I think to quickly summarize my concerns with this were fundamentally making
sure that we're seeing this-- we don't see transit as a zero-sum game. I was concerned with language
around disproportionately benefiting nonminority and/or low-income populations as compared to minority
and/or low-income populations, specifically, because sometimes benefiting transit is a finite resource, and
you have to make benefits to one community, and you can't make benefits to every single community.
But after meeting with the staff, I've been proven that that's mostly relating to adverse effects and not
necessarily additions to transit. And I think it's a difficult topic to talk about. But basically, my concerns
were we shouldn't be limiting or tying our hands to making transit better when it would make transit better
for everyone.
And those concerns were pretty much nullified by the team. And we are not going-- this document and
these service changes does not-- Title VI standards does not do that. So just wanted to be clear, and I do
support this. So thank you all for your hard work, and thank you for working with us, working with me to
get to a point where I can better understand the impacts that this would have. Thank you.
JOYANN RUSCHA: Thank you, Director Paglieri. That was very gracious. And I recognize that Director
Nicholson has his hand up. I haven't heard anything from Director Harwick. Director Harwick, I just
wanted to check to see if you had any-- OK, that's a thumbs up.
And if you don't mind, Director Nicholson, I'm going to go ahead and just check in with our colleagues
who are not members of this committee to see if they have anything that they would like to comment on
or have addressed. So for Board Chair Bouquet, Director Catlin, Director Guzman, and if there's anyone
else who's joined us since, please raise your hand so that I can call on you and give you some space as
well if you would like. And I believe Director O'Keefe was here at least earlier.
Oh, I see, Director Guzman. Sir, you are recognized. Please go ahead.
MICHAEL GUZMAN: Thank you, Chair Ruscha. So first of all, staff, thank you so much. 1,100-plus pages
of reading and detailed information to get to this point is a lot to take in. It's taken all the time we've had
availability on this to get through it.
And you make it sound so simple. So I'm always in awe of your presentations when it comes to these
matters. I do want to say thank you for the language access. For me that is truly important as a member
of the Spanish-speaking community.
And utilizing the services, it does get complicated, and I find myself more and more, as I'm writing our
public transit system, becoming a resource for folks that don't know how to navigate, using the other
methods that seem facile to people who speak the lingua franca of our fair state and city. I would also
really encourage everybody-- I'm going to be a yes vote on this when it gets to the Board. I'm just letting
you know now.
I'm really pleased with this. I know there is more work to do and more that can be done. And I appreciate
Director Nicholson's questions about why we're using numbers we are.
One observation I had and a question that came up as I was speaking with you, Mr. Green, at the city
council in Denver, and then following up with our General Manager CEO was just a general reminder-and to ensure that this is understood-- that 36-month look back that you are requesting and the Title VI
analysis in general is not a roadblock. It's not the end of the line, and it's not going to derail service
provision or planning in any way.

But this is a speed bump to make sure that we slow down enough to double-check on our analyses, and
we are ensuring that we are providing public transportation for the keyword, as our General Manager likes
to say, is public, and that means everybody. And so I just want to make sure that that is certainly
understood with clarity that this is a speed bump, to say, hey, we've made this plan. We think it looks
good on paper.
Let's double check and make sure so we can proceed forward. It does not, however, prevent us from
making service changes in any aspect, as long as we are doing what our ultimate purview is to provide
public transit. Is that a correct understanding?
CARL GREEN JR.: Chair, Ruscha, if I may?
JOYANN RUSCHA: Yes, please go ahead.
CARL GREEN JR.: Great question, Director Guzman. I just wanted to give a quick answer to that. The
answer to that question is yes. Your synopsis of what you outlined is exactly true.
And as we know, one of the board of directors-- or the board of directors' responsibility is to approve of
the service equity analysis. So essentially, even if there are additions of major service changes, we do the
analysis. You all have the ultimate responsibility to approve of the equity analysis.
So I just wanted to say it's not a roadblock. It's a holistic approval process and weighing process and way
in which we do our service equity analysis. And I did want to take a moment and just highlight and
publicly acknowledge-- because you mentioned the language access plan, and I know our trans equity
specialist, Dani McClain-- she's our first language access coordinator, leaps and bounds over these past
couple years. And it wasn't just one. It was the entire RTD. This is a one RTD line of effort and just
wanted to highlight and express my gratitude and appreciation for the agency and specifically Dani
McClain, our trans equity specialist.
MICHAEL GUZMAN: Thank you.
JOYANN RUSCHA: Thank you. Thank you, both. I don't see other hands raised. Director Harwick, my
copilot, do you see anyone else with their hands raised?
IAN HARWICK: No, but I just want to opine really quickly. I'm going to take Vice Chair's privilege just for
one second. I was in a meeting the other day up in Globeville with Dani. And She was outstanding from a
perspective of language access, but also just really listening to the community's concerns.
And it was a meeting where she unexpectedly was called on to speak up. And she just really was so
great and gracious. And actually, if you're watching, Dani, just, really, you were a rock star that day. And
you are regularly both in what you do from language access, but just also as a voice for the community.
So just wanted to chime in real quickly on that one.
JOYANN RUSCHA: Thank you, Cochair Harwick. And also, I echo those sentiments. Thank you to the
team. And I'm sure Mr. Green will also pass that along.
So with that, I don't see any other hands raised. Director Nicholson, we'll go ahead and circle back to you,
as promised. You are recognized, sir. Go ahead.
CHRIS NICHOLSON: Thank you very much. Two quick things. The first is, I agree that Dani is awesome
and have been extremely impressed with both the quality of her work and the way that she has interacted
with the board. So testament to RTD. And hopefully, this is not the last language access thing that we
have that comes before us so that we can see more of her.

With regard to the disproportionate burden in the FPL, I think what I would really like to see in-- I agree
that a memorandum's the right way to go with this. And thank you for offering that, GM/CEO Johnson. I
think getting an understanding of how we define low income at RTD, what are-- because it's probably not
just in these two places.
There are probably other things that we do that have a definition of low income. In some cases, it may be
very different than what we-- I mean, 60% of AMI when we're talking about housing is another definition of
low income. So I think a memo that explained what our definitions are of low income and where they are
and how they're different and why they're different and then what we can do to align them because, I
mean, sure, there are different levels of poverty, and there are different levels of low income and
understanding what they are and being able to articulate, OK, this program is dealing with really lowincome people, and this program is dealing with "middle to low income" people are two different things.
But broadly speaking, at least from where I sit, if we're saying the LIVE program applies to these people,
we should probably be doing our analysis around the same population that we're defining there. So trying
to get to a place where we're aligning those definitions and what would be required to align them is really
what I'd like to understand so that we, as a Board, can then come back to you and say, hey, we'd like to
do this. We'd like to align these. Tell us how hard this would be and what would be involved in that. So
that's what I would request of you, humbly.
JOYANN RUSCHA: All right. Thank you, Director Nicholson. Ms. Johnson, would you like to respond?
DEBRA JOHNSON: Yes, thank you very much, Chair Ruscha. Thank you once again, Secretary
Nicholson. As I indicated previously, we are more than amenable to providing a communiqué that will be
disseminated to the full Board, providing information that's pertinent so you all can garner an
understanding of where we're going.
And as I indicated previously as well, we're committed to ensuring that there is consistency. As Mr. Green
indicated in his remarks, we have advanced our program. There's still more work to do.
We're not going to rest on our laurels. But recognizing where we stand, we will provide information to the
best of our ability, addressing the question and the board's more-- I mean, it's within your purview to
further engage on the topic, but we're partners in this and just wanted to state that for the record. Thank
you.
JOYANN RUSCHA: Thank you, Ms. Johnson. I also just wanted to add that I would also be interested in
understanding just, I guess, legally, what the board's options would be, just recognizing that we are close
to the filing deadline.
If the Board collectively decided as a policy-making body to take a slightly different pathway with regard to
defining low income. And so for me, something that I would just like to understand is the items that
Director Nicholson mentioned. But then, hypothetically, what options we might have if we wanted to
proceed, recognizing, of course, we'd be doing it collaboratively with staff.
So I think there's definitely time to follow up on that and become more informed in the next couple of
weeks. And I really appreciate the conversation that's ensued around this, not just tonight, but over the
last month as well. Director Nicholson, I see your hand is still raised. Is that residual? OK, thank you, sir.
So I do not see any other hands in the queue. Cochair Harwick, do you see any hands up? OK, all right.
So I do believe we still have Councilwoman Lewis with us. Is that correct? Councilwoman, are you still
here?
SHONTEL M. LEWIS: I am here. I was just off camera.

JOYANN RUSCHA: OK, well, I was wondering if you could do me a favor and recognizing-- for those of
you who don't know, Councilwoman Lewis also chaired our Civil Rights Committee before it was
disbanded when we went to the small committee structure. And so would you do me the honor of doing a
roll call vote for this motion on the table? And then I will go ahead and concur with the results. I know I put
you on the spot.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
SHONTEL M. LEWIS: I'm happy to.
JOYANN RUSCHA: All right, OK, so just as a reminder, our committee members that are present are
Directors Chandler, Harwick, Paglieri, Nicholson, and myself. So take it away.
SHONTEL M. LEWIS: Thank you. Director Chandler.
KATHLEEN CHANDLER: Yes.
SHONTEL M. LEWIS: Director Harwick.
IAN HARWICK: Yes,
SHONTEL M. LEWIS: Director Nicholson.
CHRIS NICHOLSON: I'm in.
SHONTEL M. LEWIS: Director Paglieri.
BRETT PAGLIERI: Yes.
SHONTEL M. LEWIS: Chair Ruscha.
JOYANN RUSCHA: Yes.
SHONTEL M. LEWIS: Thank you.
JOYANN RUSCHA: All right, we'll end with 5 yeses and no votes. That is a unanimous yes, which means
it will go on the consent committee for the end of the month. I'd like to just take my chair's privilege and
ask for a little round of applause for our whole team, the staff, community, directors who've worked really
hard on this. So thank you and however y'all want to share your thanks, great job. Wonderful.
Oh, and with that, we are. And again, thank you, Councilwoman Lewis, for your presence tonight and
doing us the honor. I think it was well earned. And I was happy to deputize you for a moment and share
that joy. So thank you.
SHONTEL M. LEWIS: Thank you.
JOYANN RUSCHA: Moving on-- absolutely. Moving on to our next item. I want to make sure I have this in
order. I believe we have the Allied Universal security services contract extension for one year. And that
will be presented by-- hold on one second. I think it is Chief Martingano. Is that correct?
DEBRA JOHNSON: Yes, Director.
JOYANN RUSCHA: OK, all right. Thank you. And so the motion is-- or the action of requesting a motion is
Allied Universal security services contract extension for one year for the board of directors to authorize
general manager and CEO or her designee to execute a one-year extension of the existing security

services contract with Allied Universal security services, including the amendments discussed below, for a
total cost not to exceed $22,062,228. Do we have a motion?
KATHLEEN CHANDLER: I motion that we go ahead and accept the extension of that contract service,
not to exceed the amount that Chair Ruscha explained.
JOYANN RUSCHA: Thank you, Director Chandler. And I think I saw a wave from Cochair Harwick. Was
that a second, sir?
IAN HARWICK: That was a second.
JOYANN RUSCHA: OK, so we have a motion and a second. The proper motion's on the floor. And with
that, I will turn it over to Chief Martingano. You may proceed, sir, when you are ready to present this item
to committee.
STEVE MARTINGANO: Yeah, thank you for the opportunity. I'm just going to give a background. A lot of
the directors were not here when this initial contract went through, so the current RTD security model
consists of internal post certified police officers, secondary employment officers from local jurisdictions,
and contracted security officers to provide security for RTD customers, facilities, and property.
On June 11, 2019, following a comprehensive procurement process, Allied Universal was awarded a
three-year contract with three one-year options to provide system-wide security services. The initial
contract went from June 30 2022, and we exercised all three option years and that's set to expire on June
30 of 2025.
For those that don't know, Allied Universal and the contracted security provides critical infrastructure at
RTD facilities, including bus and rail stations, fare enforcement. They assist us with patrol services,
enhanced security presence during large-scale events, integrated security technology services, and
federally required commuter rail second crew member positions, duties, and responsibilities. Staff
recommends that the board authorize the GM/CEO to execute a one-year extension with Allied Universal
services to continue providing system-wide security services.
This extension will allow RTD to perform a competitive procurement for ongoing security services,
consistent with the summary scope of work, unanimously approved by the board on February 25, 2025.
RTD anticipates having a new contract in place by June 30 of 2026, subject to a successful procurement
and board approval. During the term of the existing contract, Allied Universal has fulfilled the contract
requirements to a satisfactory level and assisted RTD of a continuity of services.
In addition to extending contract for additional one year, the below modifications are recommended for
the staff. I recommended to the contract terms. We're going to leave-- we're going to do our current
quarter three levels of 9,481 hours per week.
And it's going to be a 3% increase to hourly wage rate for the armed and unarmed security services
personnel. The above proposed amendments are anticipated to enhance overall contract performance
and ensure adequate coverage of RTD continues to shift its resources allocation to increase its internal
police force and decrease reliance upon contract security while also responding to increased demand for
security. The hourly wages increased are intended to improve recruitment and retention and are also
supported by market data and are consistent with increase in prior years of the contract.
In adopting this recommended action, the agency seeks to meet the 2021 to 2026 strategic plan priorities
of community value and customer excellence. Especially with the perceived value of RTD in terms of
community value would enhance, through the hiring of additional unarmed security officers, to serve in
ambassador and customer service roles, continued deployment of contract security personnel and higher
visibility uniforms, yielding a greater sense of employee, customer, and overall community security in
areas RTD serves. And also increased customer excellence will be achieved through the continued

viability of RTD police department to employ unarmed security officers on commuter rail services, thereby
improving system reliability and decreasing delays.
Also improving system-- that's actually written here twice. I apologize for that, and meeting requirements
mandated by federal guidelines for commuter rail services so that RTD can continue services for
commuter rail functions.
JOYANN RUSCHA: Thank you, Chief. Do we have any questions or discussion on this item? Oh, first, I
want to recognize General Manager and CEO Ms. Johnson. MS Johnson, please go ahead.
CARL GREEN JR.: Yes, thank you very much, Chair Ruscha. Just for everyone's edification that may
have not been in attendance last night, the Finance and Planning Committee, there was a action item
relative to a budgetary transfer, wanted to ensure that, relative to this extension and the monies that are
contained, they are contained within the budget. It was merely a line-item transfer. Chief Martingano
referenced the second crew member, so there are monies that are being leveraged from the rail
operations, budget being transferred.
So I just wanted to ensure everybody was aware that this is not an additional cost that we're incurring as
we go forward with a successor contract through the midst of a procurement. Wanted to ensure that you
all knew that we have maintained our fiduciary responsibility, ensuring that we have adequate funds.
Thank you.
JOYANN RUSCHA: Thank you, General Manager Johnson, for explaining that. So, yes, this was
authorized as a budget transfer by FNP committee last night. It was budgeted.
But per our fiscal policy and rules, we did have to go through that motion before we could send it back to
this committee. I see that, Director Guzman, your hand is raised. I'm going to go ahead and call on you.
And Director Harwick will start the clock, and then we'll move to Director Nicholson.
MICHAEL GUZMAN: Mine's real quick. I just want to confirm exactly what was said. So, yes, Finance and
Planning approved this for you to be able to do your part. Thank you for the cooperation and allowing us
to do our part in this.
JOYANN RUSCHA: All right, thank you, sir. You just set a record. Sometimes our committees are a Venn
diagram, and this one's a 1-2-- ooh, I would say punch, but that sounds like a bad joke. Director
Nicholson, you're recognized.
CHRIS NICHOLSON: So I hate to ask a quick point of information first. But isn't it our policy on the
committee to recognize committee members first and then non-committee members afterward? Not that I
didn't appreciate Director Guzman's comment, but just to put you on the record here, isn't that supposed
to be how we do things?
JOYANN RUSCHA: Um, it's not-- well, so it's not a formal rule. It's more of a tradition. And it's possible
that I have misfiring neurons when it gets to be 8:17 PM and thought you had already spoken, so we had
already cycled through. But no punishment intended, Director Nicholson. But if you do have anything else
that you wanted to add meaningfully to the conversation, you may.
CHRIS NICHOLSON: I do, actually, and this is going to take a second, so I apologize. So I received an
email from a constituent about allied a couple of days ago that I shared with leadership. And I think that
it's important to share with everybody because I think it gets to one of the questions that I have and a lot
of people have about this contract and our use of third-party security as opposed to police officers. So I'm
just going to read it.

Hi, Chris, who handles security on the A line? I was just on the 9:00 PM leaving Union Station for the
airport. Only a few cars were open, crammed with families.
A few minutes after we departed, a female security guard started screaming from the front of the car, we
need TSS. Get out of the way for TSS. Kids were crying.
One little boy said, Daddy, is something wrong with the train? If there had been a bomb on the train, she'd
have still been overreacting. Eventually, TSS strolled with her to a forward car.
When we got to DIA, I asked TSS what the excitement was. He said not your business and ended with,
have a good night, Karen. He was also wearing one of those fascist little thin blue line patches. Is this
RTD?
I guarantee a lot of those families won't be on again. And I don't use RTD every day to be treated like this.
Naturally, the RTD line is closed now. I guess I only have one question to follow that is when someone
says TSS, that refers to a Transit Security Specialist from RTD, not one of our PD members. Is that
correct?
STEVE MARTINGANO: Chair, if I may?
JOYANN RUSCHA: Yes, Chief. Please go ahead.
STEVE MARTINGANO: Yeah, so TSS does mean the Transit Security Specialist under the allied
definitions in their roles. So neither party that was mentioned in that was a transit police officer. They
were both the contracted security personnel that was on the train utilizing-- we were utilizing them as
secondary employment. I'm sorry, secondary crew members.
So that email was sent over. It's being investigated by Allied Universal management in regards to their
personnel issues. And once we get a finding, we then work with them in regards to if that individual
violated any policies or procedures could be removed from the account or be placed somewhere else.
JOYANN RUSCHA: Thank you, sir. Director Nicholson, I trust that satisfies your question. And if it's all
right, any follow-ups, I will entrust you to take care of that via email with the chief and staff as appropriate.
I'd like to just remind everyone it's 8:20 PM.
Not here to cut off discussion, but we do have a few more items on our agenda. And we all have
diminishing returns after a certain time. So with that, we have a proper motion on the table. And seeing no
further hands raised, I'm going to go ahead and call for a vote. Director Chandler, how do you vote?
KATHLEEN CHANDLER: Yes.
JOYANN RUSCHA: OK, well, yes. And Director Harwick, Cochair Harwick?
IAN HARWICK: Yes.
JOYANN RUSCHA: All right, Director Paglieri?
BRETT PAGLIERI: Yes.
JOYANN RUSCHA: Thank you. Director Nicholson?
CHRIS NICHOLSON: Yes for today.

JOYANN RUSCHA: Thank you. And I will also be a yes vote. And so with that, we have five yeses. And
that will be placed on a consent committee for our regularly scheduled board meeting unless it is later
pulled off at that time.
And so with that, we will move on to our discussion items for the evening. And we have four? Yeah, four,
yes, for tonight's agenda. So first item is for transit vision 0. And I'd like to ask our General Manager and
CEO Debra Johnson, as well as-- I want to make sure I pronounce this correctly. So-DEBRA JOHNSON: Chair, I'll do that if you don't mind.
JOYANN RUSCHA: Oh.
DEBRA JOHNSON: Yes.
JOYANN RUSCHA: Yeah, sure. I also think that someone might not have their mute on. So there's a bit
of interference.
But if you would like to go ahead and take it away, Ms. Johnson, and introduce your staff, I'm happy to
turn it over.
DEBRA JOHNSON: Thank you so much, Chair Ruscha. Greatly appreciate it. And just for the full
committee's edification.
It was last year. Last year, in the fall, the board adopted a Vision Zero resolution. And more to the point,
just in January, this board adopted some SMART goals, SMART short-term goals, Specific Measurable
Attainable Realistic Time-bound Goals as it relates to the position which I hold as the General
Manager/CEO regarding Vision Zero.
Recognizing this evening, the intent of this presentation is to ensure that we ground all committee
members in our efforts going forward, we got to this point earlier last year working in conjunction with then
not Chair of the committee, but Director Ruscha and Director Harwick. They were the ones championing
Vision Zero along with Director Guzman relative to what might RTD do relative to ensuring a transit
environment that minimizes conflict in reference to vehicular traffic.
With that as a backdrop, quite naturally, when we talk about Vision Zero, holistically, here in the Denver
metro region, we do have our Metropolitan Planning Organization, which is the Denver Regional Council
of Government. Some of you sit on the Regional Transportation Committee in conjunction with myself,
recognizing that they are the true planning entity for our metro region and our designated MPO pursuant
to statute. With that as a backdrop, we have Alicia Leitgeb, who works in planning.
And she actually is working in conjunction with DRCOG and other entities on Vision Zero related items.
And she's leaned into the moment, and she's a member of Bill Sirois' staff in transit-oriented communities.
What we intend to do this evening is present an overview of Vision Zero and provide context for RTD's
role in Vision Zero.
And this discussion tonight will allow me to better develop the strategic initiatives identified in my goals,
as I indicated, and more or less, garner guidance from all of you relative to where we stand in reference
to the resolution. And I'm more than willing to take feedback because this is a collective effort. And Ms.
Leitgeb has done some work and will provide some context, and I will close out the presentation and add
a little more detail on our thoughts relative to the path forward. So with that, Alicia, I will yield the floor to
you.
ALICIA LEITGEB: Thank you very much, and good evening, everyone. As already said, my name is Alicia
Leitgeb. I'm a member of the planning department at RTD. And we're here to talk to you tonight about
Vision Zero, specifically within the context of transit agencies and even more specifically about RTD.

So we want to first set a baseline around Vision Zero itself. And what exactly we're talking about when
we're referring to a Vision Zero. Vision Zero is a traffic safety effort which sets the goal of zero fatalities
and zero serious injuries on roadways.
The goal, no matter what your community is or where your starting point is, the goal is to bring those
numbers down to zero. And in working towards this goal, many different stakeholders have to be
involved. It takes planners, engineers, policymakers, the decision-making of individual road users across
various modes and also enforcement and continued evaluation of our existing conditions.
How does that apply in Colorado? Well, in our own region, we have the Denver Regional Council of
Governments, DRCOG, as well as several local jurisdictions who have set their own Vision Zero goals or
adopted plans. DRCOG convenes professionals around Vision Zero to share ideas and coordinate on
projects, and locals are constantly analyzing and reconfiguring their infrastructure in order to meet those
goals. It's important to note here that the roadways on which RTD is operating are managed by other
entities, so we cannot make unilateral decisions about road right of way. But we can and we do have a
voice in infrastructure conversations.
I also want to highlight that RTD has these two different safety perspectives internally. It's key to highlight
how these perspectives can work together where they overlap. And just to be clear, one is not a subset of
another. One cannot fully replace another perspective as they each take a deeper dive into different focus
areas.
One example of this would be within RTD's safety perspective. We look at incidents that occur at RTD
facilities, on RTD properties, employee on-the-job injuries, operator assaults. And these things specifically
would not be reviewed as part of a Vision Zero perspective. Instead, Vision Zero really looks externally at
how the transit system interacts with the larger transportation network. So Vision Zero is very focused, of
course, on the location of different incidents, the mode that was involved because these types of
characteristics can then influence what interventions are appropriate at a given location, whether that be
an intersection or a specific corridor.
So delving deeper into the context of transit agencies generally, first, it's important to acknowledge that
transit itself is a preferred mode of travel when we're talking about increasing safety in our transportation
network, shifting users from automobiles and onto transit can help support those community Vision Zero
goals. And one of the most important things that RTD can do to promote Vision Zero is to provide highquality transit service.
Now, even though that is the backdrop of the conversation, there certainly are other factors to consider
that could move the conversation on Vision Zero forward further. Some of these opportunities could
involve providing funding, policy and planning efforts related to agency-owned properties, overall safety
and awareness campaigns. I'm going to highlight some examples from other transit agencies related to
those three topics, but I want to make clear that the three transit agencies that are noted on the slide
here, they themselves do not brand their initiatives as Vision Zero per se.
But the goals and the initiatives themselves are very much in line with the goals of Vision Zero. And none
of these agencies are a one-to-one match with RTD. We all operate different services. We have different
service areas, climates, et cetera. And overall, if we're applying a Vision Zero perspective to a transit
agency, there's no one size fits all approach.
So looking first at transit agency-funded infrastructure improvements. So much like RTD, BART cannot
simply go out and reconfigure any street surrounding their stations that they would like. But they did
determine that it was worthwhile to financially support right-of-way improvements.
Specifically, they established a grant program called Safe Routes to BART, which was funded through a
larger ballot measure aimed at rebuilding critical BART infrastructure. A small portion of that overall
budget was reserved for active of transportation projects, so walking and biking, that connected transit

customers to BART stations. And here highlighted is an example of one of the projects that was funded
through the Safe Routes to BART program.
Specifically, it was to create a protected intersection along a corridor that was nearby to the Fremont
BART station where there were other substantial bike infrastructure improvements already completed or
underway. The total budget that BART put forward for the Safe Routes to BART program was $25 million.
That has now all been awarded.
Moving on to policy and planning, this is another opportunity to support Vision Zero. One example of a
policy that would apply is a station access policy. So the focus there would be to establish goals for how
transit customers can access service and particularly to establish a hierarchy for station access, which is
what you see on the right here.
You'll notice that this places pedestrians and cyclists at the top of that hierarchy. And these are the folks
that we would refer to as vulnerable road users from the Vision Zero perspective. This policy can help
guide future decision-making about transit agency-owned assets such as their land holdings.
And finally, transit agencies can promote safety directly to the public through things such as signage at
stations or wraps on vehicles. These campaigns could be broad in nature, focused specifically on Vision
Zero or transit safety or could address more specific issues such as suicide prevention.
So now I'd like to share a little bit about RTD's data and how this could be used for Vision Zero purposes.
So an important element of Vision Zero is being able to track progress towards that goal over time, that
goal being reaching zero fatalities and zero serious injuries. The source of truth here for us would be
RTD's own internal data.
However, this information is used differently across different teams at the agency. Vision Zero would look,
again, at mode of the other entity involved in a crash, so pedestrians, cyclists, other motorists. Right now
data related to cyclist is being recorded as a part of other travel modes, which makes it difficult to filter out
the data we would need to give a clear picture and track those figures over time.
Vision Zero also, again, focuses on those injuries and fatalities. Where this is tricky is specifically with that
fatality figure. It's difficult to consistently acquire that information.
And just to give you an example, unfortunately, if a fatality did occur and that happened at the scene or
there was video evidence that RTD staff could review, that could be clearly recorded as a fatality data
point. However, there are cases where someone could be transported to a hospital and then later pass
away from their injuries. And in those scenarios, RTD typically doesn't have insight into outcomes further
down the road in order to reflect those in our own data.
And finally, we're often using the word accident, which is very different from the conversation amongst
Vision Zero professionals which has specifically tried to move away from the term accident, with the
reasoning being that accidents are typically thought of as something that is out of our hands or somewhat
inevitable or somewhat acceptable. But the perspective of Vision Zero is very clearly that no number of
fatalities or serious injuries is acceptable and given the design and construction of our transportation
system, an accident would be a misnomer.
So looking at an example, that should be relatively familiar. This is from last month's OSS committee
meeting, the safety performance report that was delivered by RTD safety team staff. You can start to see
some of the differences in how RTD's internal data would be used and reported. So again, we would just
be looking at those fatalities and injuries.
We would also not have a need from the Vision Zero perspective to break out services by directly
operated or purchased transportation. And then, of course, we would not be comparing the performance

to goals set in the PTASP. Our goal consistently across the board would be to help those numbers reach
zero.
So I mentioned earlier that there are some examples from other transit agencies that are seemingly
engaging in Vision Zero-esque actions, even if they don't have a formal Vision Zero declaration. And I
want to note that RTD is part of that as well. These are activities that we would not typically call a Vision
Zero initiative, but again, are in alignment with the goals of Vision Zero.
So of course, we want to locate bus stops in safe locations for our customers, which often means placing
stops so that a bus first will cross through an intersection before stopping at the far side and allowing
customers to exit and enter the vehicle at that point. RTD staff are also regularly coordinating with
developers and local jurisdictions on infrastructure changes, right of way improvements, and things of the
like. Related to suicide prevention, there are resources that are carried by RTD-PD and available on
vehicles or online. And right now, RTD staff are also working on the BSIAA, the Bus Stop Infrastructure
and Accessibility Assessment, which is an effort focused on collecting data related to bus stops
throughout the district so that we have a better understanding of what's on the ground. And with that, I
would like to hand things off to our general manager and CEO to conclude the presentation.
DEBRA JOHNSON: Thank you so much, Ms. Leitgeb. So if you can progress to the next slide, thank you
very kindly. So really, where we stand here relative to next steps, we want to ensure that we are working
in tandem with committee leadership for operation safety and security so we can ground ourselves in our
path forward.
So recognizing the work that has been done by staff, looking at different examples, it's important to note,
when the resolution came forward from the Board of Directors, RTD would be the first transit agency, i.e.,
that would have a Vision Zero resolution in the vein of what was just outlined, recognizing BART and VTA
and MARTA. While there are certain elements there recognizing that transit agencies generally don't have
auspices over the arterioles and things the like of which they are traversing with their vehicles, there's the
partnership aspect. So as we look at next steps, one thing that's critically important is we want to at least
get some guidance relative to a couple of elements that we want to explore, for instance, USDOT.
There is a grant available, Safe Streets and Roads for All. Applications are due in June. Staff will explore
opportunities to apply for this grant to address Vision Zero planning and potential pilot projects. This will
give us an opportunity to have a funding base going forward. And with these projects, they're from a
planning nature, so it'll give us an opportunity to really do our due diligence relative to what could be as
we go forward.
As we talk about adopting a station access policy, recognizing the example that was provided relative to
the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District, i.e. BART, this might be an opportunity for us as well
as we talk about establishing goals for how transit customers can get to stations and access service. It
really would create a hierarchy with vulnerable road users at the top and pedestrians and cyclists and
scooter users as well.
As we all see relative to the arterioles in and around downtown, you have individuals that are utilizing
scooters, oftentimes impeding, I would say, movement of vehicular traffic because folks aren't adhering to
the rules, and I know Cochair Ian Harwick will be familiar with this quite naturally, when you're not
supposed to be riding a scooter on the streets-- or excuse me, on the sidewalks of the City and County of
Denver, for instance. So this would give us an opportunity to ensure that we could work in tandem and
leverage a clear-cut policy relative to that.
Quite naturally, as we shift to the external focus, collaboration with local jurisdictions is paramount.
Through the DRCOG regional Vision Zero working group, which, Ms. Leitgeb is a member and through
development proposals and right of way, reconfiguration reviews.

And then, quite naturally, what's critically important, we know, is public engagement. And a safety
awareness campaign, possibility to be led by RTD's communications and engagement team basically
would garner input, opinions, and perceptions from the community. Also, from our vantage point,
including promotional materials, such as station signage and bus apps and web materials, those are just
examples, to really further the conversation about how incredibly important it is because we're all players
in ensuring that we could get to some level of zero.
I would be remiss not to state that as we engage with our partners at DRCOG, the community as a whole,
the region as a whole has been working on this, and we all collectively have work to do to get to the zero.
But with that, I wanted to yield the floor to Committee Chair to offer some insights relative to the entire
committee as it relates to potential paths forward. So I wanted to thank you all for the opportunity. And
quite naturally, this will, in turn, help us discern, as we go forward, what initiatives we can leverage
relative to short-term goals that will benefit not only internally but our customers as a whole and the
traveling population. So with that, I'll yield the floor, Madam Chair-- excuse me, I yield the floor, Chair
Ruscha.
JOYANN RUSCHA: Thank you. Thank you very much for this wonderful presentation and the
thoughtfulness behind it. And so I'm going to go ahead and speak to some of the items and just give a
quick review of what we had done last year and the year prior. So I believe-- and correct me if I'm wrong,
Vice Chair Harwick, June marks the two-year mark of when we first started this conversation.
So for my new colleagues on the Board, we, we being myself, Director Harwick, and Director Guzman,
met with Vision Zero advocates and said, hey, could Vision Zero apply to transit. And I'll be honest, the
response we got initially was modal shift is part of Vision Zero, get people out of cars. But then we said,
you know what, why not have some town halls and discussions and do some research and think about it.
What's the worst that can happen. And as it turned out, as we progressed, and we worked, I think, four
and a half-- five months, actually, over multiple meetings, collectively, we clocked well over 120 hours.
And we found that, yes, Vision Zero does apply to transit when a transit agency embraces it.
But what we don't have in North American culture is that culture of embracing Vision Zero. As someone
on our working group said, zero means zero, not less. And so when we say that RTD embarking on this
endeavor really is groundbreaking, we're not just tooting our own horns.
We are not being disingenuous. There is no blueprint, at least in the US-- or I would say even Canada.
Although, they're starting to move towards it-- that we could say, OK, this is what this transit agency does
and we are going to apply.
That being said, Vision Zero principles apply. And the models that we could look at, particularly in certain
countries in Europe, are operating under very different systems. And so it might feel like, two years on,
we're behind.
But recognizing that this is a really major endeavor, and this is government, and we have a lot of moving
parts, we're also moving at the speed of lightning. So this is a lot of progress. I will make sure that all of
members of the committee, if I haven't done it already, I will share with you all of the documents, the
original resolution.
There's a shared drive, and you're free to poke through and see our meeting minutes and reach out with
any questions at any time as we move forward in this endeavor. I want to just finally note, as our CEO
noted that what we have tonight is just a starting point, a jump-off point. It's a discussion point and an
opportunity for committee members to weigh in on what they would like to see in terms of next steps and
outcomes.
This doesn't get done overnight. It doesn't get done in a month. But we have to start somewhere.

And the board and staff were very clear last year that zero means zero, and we're going to do the work.
And so with that, I will also note that I conferred with my colleague, Director Harwick who was an
extraordinary champion for this policy and did so much work with me and Director Guzman to bring this
forward. And he has generously offered his time to be our committee's point of reference and contact to
work with staff as they move forward collectively and collaboratively.
And then they can report back to this committee as needed. And we will discuss next steps in the months
ahead. I fully trust him. He is a subject matter expert, and I sometimes think I get a disproportionate
amount of credit for Vision Zero, but Director Harwick was a silent hero in the background, and it really is
shared between the three of us who worked on this and the groups and staff who also came in and gave
their feedback and advice.
So with that, Director Nicholson, I see your hand up. I'll recognize you. Please go ahead and ask any
questions or give feedback.
CHRIS NICHOLSON: Thank you very much, Chair Ruscha. So one thing that I've learned from having
two of my friends kill themselves when I was growing up is that if someone really wants to commit suicide,
it can often be very, very difficult to stop them. And I think that, for me, as my mother liked to say when I
was growing up, you can't control the actions of other people. You can just control your own response.
One thing that I didn't see in the presentation was any mention of response times because the difference
between having a suicide attempt and being found a minute after it happens versus being found 20
minutes after it happens is often the difference between hospital and morgue. And so I wanted to get a
sense of, do we think about measuring how quickly we are able to respond and whether we have assets
in the right locations in order to be able to respond in under five minutes, under 10 minutes, under 20
minutes, whatever the benchmark is? And do we think that that is a metric by which we should be
measuring our ability to effectively address these incidents? Thank you.
JOYANN RUSCHA: Thank you, Director Nicholson. If you don't mind, I wanted to ask just a clarifying
question so that I understand. I was listening and tracking with CART. So when you talk about a response
time, are you referencing a response time in which staff or there's some indication that somebody might
commit harm or after harm has been committed or both? I just I wanted to understand, and then I will
yield the floor to Ms. Johnson to answer.
CHRIS NICHOLSON: Yeah, no, really great question. I think more in the instance of something actually
happening, someone being hit by a train or a bus and us having a resource to provide first aid to get
someone. But I think addressing both of those because we don't generally see reports when someone is
saved before something happens.
All the successes don't get-- we don't get any numbers on those, and maybe we should. But, yeah, just
the general ability of our staff, of our police, of our security staff to effectively provide assistance when
these incidents happen. So I think the answer is really both but more the former.
JOYANN RUSCHA: Thank you, sir. Ms. Johnson, please go ahead.
DEBRA JOHNSON: Thank you very much, Chair Ruscha. Thank you, Secretary Nicholson, for the
question. So while I appreciate it, the purpose of our presentation tonight was, more or less, to give
guidance and direction.
But to address your question specifically when you were talking about individuals that may want to cause
harm to themselves or things of the like, recognizing what was presented, oftentimes, we may not relative
to the causal factors relative to circumstances that may occur in and around our right of way because
we're not privy to that information, for instance. If in fact, somebody basically was traversing our right of
way, for instance, and just, say, something occurred or somebody went around a warning systems and

things of the like, there's no way if we know it's intentional or not. But there are protocols and processes in
place that we have quite naturally, and individuals are trained within our organization.
But relative to the specific question that you ask, that's very difficult for us relative to the data in which
was mentioned and last month too when we had our system safety personnel, Nathan Marx presenting
that, that Information is very hard to deduce relative to us going forward. So we can conjecture and
speculate.
One thing that's critically important as we look at what we're doing collectively and pursuing a planning
grant such as this, perhaps-- and I qualify that perhaps because I haven't looked at the criteria for that
notice of funding opportunity, what the various aspects of that would entail. But that is a possibility as we
move forward. So I just wanted to ensure that you understood that the purpose here was to talk about the
different possibilities, and where might we go relative to leveraging aspects that could decrease the
conflict with bicyclists, pedestrians, scooter users in and around RTD's right of way in conjunction with
partnerships through local jurisdictions?
JOYANN RUSCHA: Thank you. Thank you, Ms. Johnson. Director Nicholson, I'll let you go ahead for a
follow-up.
CHRIS NICHOLSON: Yeah, just to clarify, I was referring to suicide as a personal example. This,
obviously, applies regardless of whether someone is hit because they were in-- we've had incidents since
I've been on the board that were due to someone getting hit when they were trying to run across the
thing, and it was pretty clearly not an incident of self-harm. And we've had incidents where maybe it was
maybe, it wasn't.
I'm just wondering, does it make sense for us to try and clock our ability to get to those scenes, to get to
those incidents and understand, are we doing it quickly? Or are we taking a long time? Are we doing it
well in certain locations than others? And how are we doing relative to other transit agencies that try to
have certain-- and obviously the DPD and others probably respond to a lot of our incidents as the first
people. But because we were talking about data, and we had a bunch of things on the data slide, and one
of them was not response times, and that's what flagged this for me.
DEBRA JOHNSON: Director Ruscha-- Chair Ruscha, excuse me, if-JOYANN RUSCHA: Absolutely, go ahead.
DEBRA JOHNSON: So, yes, thank you for the clarity, Secretary Nicholson. And I know you are using
suicide as an example. And I'm talking about just holistically in reference to trespassers and interactions
with rolling stock. From the transit perspective, what we're tracking is how quickly we can restore service
because our primary responsibility is service delivery.
So if, in fact, there is an incident, what are we doing to ensure the connectivity or the seamlessness-- or
not seamlessness. I shouldn't have used that term. But how quickly are we restoring service when there
is a disruption or interruption? And that's what we're tracking because, quite naturally, if there is a
circumstance, and there is another responding jurisdiction, this gets to the factors that I have raised in
previous conversations when we talk about on-time performance or service reliability, there could be
extenuating circumstances of which we have no auspices over.
And so recognizing what we do have auspices over to the best of our ability is the restoration of service to
continue on with what our core business is, which is transit service delivery. And so that's what we're
looking at because how quickly can we put a bus bridge in place if there is a disabled vehicle because
we've been told to hold the vehicle due to the fact that it's going to be part of an investigation. We are
limited in what we can do. So we're looking at it from service restoration perspective and not in reference
to a response time of the impact relative to a circumstance that has happened in and around the agency's
right of way.

JOYANN RUSCHA: Thank you, Ms. Johnson. I'd also like to just add to that. Director Nicholson and I, I
know that you joined some of our Vision Zero meetings, and one of the things that we also spoke about
was mitigation strategies and our grade crossings and technology that would be available that may not
stop every incident but certainly would reduce the risk of that unfortunate outcome.
And so that could be a pathway that RTD could explore. And I don't want to speak for staff, so I hope I
don't get this wrong, but if I recall, it might've been two or three years ago, we did apply for a lidar grant.
And I think it was Smith and Havana that would detect bicyclists-- for the PTC to detect bicyclists, excuse
me.
And unfortunately, we didn't receive those funds. But that would be an example of a preventative
measure that helps everybody and increases just safety for all. So I won't speak from my ivory tower and
get too deep into it. But I think that the point you brought up was good and salient. And there are
opportunities, multiple opportunities that we could explore to reduce these incidences.
As the person who lives in the neighborhood with the most passenger strikes that result in death, literally
up the street. I can say it hurts. And it hurts my neighbors as well.
So with that, are there any other folks who would like to offer comment? I have a couple of things that I
personally would like to see come out of a plan moving forward that I'd like to address quickly. And then,
as noted, we will let Director Harwick confer with staff, and they can report back on some more concrete
next steps in the next couple of months in how we will move forward in planning.
So seeing no other hands, I just want to note a couple of things. So first is I really loved the discussion
about station access. So I live next to Peoria Station, and we call it playing Frogger because the
pedestrian environment has cars in a parking lot.
The station itself isn't very accessible for the pedestrian to get there. And then you cross along the R line
and A line FasTracks and one falls under the FTA and the other, FRA. And they have different
regulations.
And we even have a passive crossing if you're exiting-- I think we call it the north side. I call it the east
side-- which essentially means it's line of sight. And so that really spoke to me. There are other stations,
of course, that I think could use a second look.
But even something like doing a study on a station that we have data on that we know incidents are
occurring would enable us to potentially move forward with some strategies relative to that, what we call a
hotspot. So I really appreciated that being called out. And is that the-- oh, I'm sorry.
That's my Alexa. And I thought it was the-- or is it-- no, it's my Alexa. So I'm going to pause and tell Alexa
to pause.
Well, now I know it's 9 o'clock. Thank you. Thank you, friends. For me, I'd like to see more inclusion of rail
and at-grade highway intersections, a plan, framework and ensuring public participation.
And think about, what can we do now in planning for next year's budget? Whether it is grant potential, but
also our internal funds. Really just radically embracing the safety culture. Challenging ourselves.
Continuing that community outreach. I call it smarter engineering. Sometimes small infrastructure
upgrades can make a huge difference. Ensuring that we are continuing to engage with our labor partners,
the ATU and our Joint Labor Management Safety Committee.
And looking at things like language access barriers, ADA accessibility, and just remembering that all of
our customers are pedestrians at some point. Even when you drive to a park and ride, you're going to get
out of your vehicle and make your way to one of our vehicles.

And so I think that we've gotten off to a great start. There's a lot of work to be done. I'm very proud of
where we are.
And Director Harwick has my full faith and confidence in moving forward. So I wanted to close on that,
that positive point and say thank you for staff time and engagement. We, as a Board and as a community,
asked a lot.
We asked RTD to be the first. And that's not a small request. And so I think it's also our responsibility to
give and support as well.
And we are here, I think, individually and collectively to provide that when needed. So with that, seeing no
other hands, and it is 9 o'clock, and I was hoping to get out by 9:30. We've got a few more items.
We will go ahead and close out this discussion and move on to our customer-facing communications,
real-time information, and service alerts. This was brought to you by Director Nicholson earlier in the year
and successfully added to our work plan. So I would like to ask Stuart Summers, our chief
communications and engagement officer; Will Adams, senior manager, excuse me, Customer Care; and
Patrick McMahon, manager of Software, Architecture, and Development to present this item. Whomever
is on tap first, you may proceed when you're ready.
STUART SUMMERS: Thank you and good evening, Chair Ruscha and members of the Operations,
Safety, and Security Committee. As introduced, my name is Stuart Summers. I'm the Chief
Communications and Engagement Officer here at RTD. This evening, I'm joined by Will Adams, our
senior manager of Customer Care, and Mr. Patrick McMahon, our manager of Software, Architecture, and
Development.
This evening, we're going to take you through customer communications and specifically focus on realtime information and our service alerts and provide an update about our mobile application project that is
underway. So as far as an outline, we'll start and navigate you with some of our system overview, the
architecture, some of the challenges we're facing today. We'll take you through service alerts, how they
are disseminated and how we engage with customers via that process. We'll take you through our mobile
applications and some changes that are on the horizon, some near-term plans we have to enhance our
mobile applications and then just take you through some next steps and timeline as well.
So as far as an overview, I think it's important to start with what are the goals of customer
communications? And first and foremost, we want to ensure that we're supporting that customer
experience, providing clear, timely, accurate information, the information that customers need to be able
to use our services to navigate the system and do it in a way that's comfortable, convenient, and efficient.
Also promoting transit access and utilization, proactively communicating so that individuals that are using
our bus and rail services are able to fully access those services and repeat utilization in the future.
Also, support our bus and rail operations. We are people in the people moving business. We want to
ensure that the digital tools and the resources we provide allow customers to freely use the system and
avoid overreliance on staff for information. We don't want to have to be a barrier to people having the
information they need to access our services.
And then lastly, and I think just as important, we want to build trust and transparency. We want to make
sure that we're providing consistent updates, the information that people need so that they can freely use
the system and do it, especially during disruptions so that there are no barriers, that people know exactly
how to get from point A to point B and do it in the manner that they expect with as least disruption as
possible, especially during those unplanned disruptions. So I want to now turn it over to Mr. Patrick
McMahon to take us through a little bit about our system architecture.
PATRICK MCMAHON: Yeah, thank you Stuart. Again, I'm Patrick McMahon. I'm the manager of
Software, Architecture, and Development. I'll give you a brief overview of our real-time information

system, the transit information system. So real times-- I'm sorry, RTD's prediction engine, the TIS system
at a high level consists of three main architectural components-- inputs, storage and transformation, and
outputs.
Inputs consist of disparate data sources and disparate and unique data sources depending on the mode
of transportation. We have legacy on-premise infrastructure and technology and modern cloud platforms
that comprise the storage and transformation component. Outputs are derived and delivered using
various information service delivery methods that support customer-facing communications. Next slide.
So at a high level, this is a diagram demonstrating some of the complexity involved with our current realtime information service delivery. You can see that inputs and outputs, the inputs and outputs data
pipeline is inconsistent across the architectural landscape. You can see, on the left and the inputs,
different modes of transportation, different systems that we're using as source data to feed into our TIS
prediction engine.
So you've got SCADA on light rail. You've got INIT CAD AVL onboard the buses. You've got commuter
rail. There's a third-party Wabtec application that hands off data to RTD to then transform into our
prediction engine.
And then you have service alerts going through a separate data pipeline. All of these are outputting to
different channels. Whether it's third-party applications or RTD applications or signage at our stations and
stops, all this information is, from a data pipeline perspective, very disparate. Next slide.
So some of the challenges the information system data pipeline lacks standardized source data feeds as
I've mentioned. Furthermore, the real-time prediction engine was originally developed in an inflexible and
monolithic coding framework, implemented on end-of-life infrastructure technology, limiting our ability to
scale to the evolving needs of the agency. Next slide.
In addition, RTD's current scheduling software does not have the flexibility to accommodate scheduled
changes in the middle of a run board, so in other words, maintenance activity that might change the
schedule that's already been published. To accommodate these changes to the run board, RTD
developers must hardcode the change into the application code base. Because of this monolithic code
base, any change presents risks to the overall integrity of the software application. Next slide.
Additional challenges around the disparate data sources. These disparate data sources and methods
create complexity of inconsistency in the level of prediction accuracy for each mode of transportation. As I
mentioned, SCADA for light rail, the onboard INIT system for bus, and the proprietary software called
Wabtec for commuter rail.
Recently, going back to light rail, RTD deployed an internally developed light rail GPS solution that is
currently being monitored for accuracy and reliability. Overall, what we have seen is that using light rail
GPS is significantly more accurate than SCADA. However, as good as the new light rail GPS system is,
the application, the underlying infrastructure that it sits on still provides or presents reliability risks for light
rail GPS and other RTD applications running on this infrastructure. Next slide.
RTD plans to modernize its information service delivery systems and underlying infrastructure through a
comprehensive architectural approach. This will provide modern enterprise data services that meet
current agency needs and are flexible and scalable enough to adapt to future demands. This is not a
point solution. This is a shift away from one-off solutions to enterprise service delivery that scales, all
based on sound enterprise architecture principles. And next slide.
STUART SUMMERS: I'm going to pivot and talk a little bit about digital signage. About a year ago, at the
Operations, Safety, and Security Committee, I gave a presentation about RTD's digital signage and some
efforts we had at that time underway and things that are continuing to this day. So I think it's important to

note, as Mr. McMahon had mentioned, that there are multiple different data feeds that also feed our
different digital signage that we have at rail platforms and at select bus stops.
And so we have several different digital signage types across the system. Last year we began an
assessment of the different signage, really trying to understand where we had signage that wasn't
working, is inoperable, and then also making plans to replace signage that wasn't working with functional
signage. And just to illustrate this point A little bit further, there's three types of signage, three buckets that
we consider for our digital signage.
We have what's called VMS, or Variable Message Signs. These would be-- they display one to three lines
of text. It's usually service-related information installed at light rail platforms. Commuter rail platforms
around Denver Union Station.
The second category are what we call PIDs, or Public Information Displays. This is an example from the
underground bus concourse at Denver Union Station. Their customer and employee facing.
We have them internal at some of our employee facilities really focused on displaying schedule
information that's more complex. Also, must-know information, we use them to promote different RTD
services. And then also there's a share of voice with Lamar Advertising for paid advertisements.
And then the last one, which is new to our system in about the last 18 months, are what we call UATs, or
Universal Advertising Totems, or simply totems. And these are predominantly at our rail platforms. We
have more than 100 that are in the ground today, really to display schedule information, promote agency
services, safety information, transit watch promotions, et cetera.
So really, trying to be forward facing with customers. And this is what we're trying to assess as we go
through this data architecture that Mr. McMahon mentioned, of all these different signage, have different
feeds going to them and ensuring that the same information is presented in all areas so it's accurate and
consistent. Next, I want to turn it over to Mr. Adams to take us through service alerts.
WILL ADAMS: Thanks, Stuart. Next slide. The Customer Care Division is responsible for the service
alerts system itself, its processes, and our standard operating procedures.
The system itself, as Patrick mentioned, feeds data to TIS and to Salesforce. So we're reliant somewhat
on the uptime of those systems. The purpose of our service alerts are to provide real-time updates about
disruptions, delays, detours and other changes impacting bus and rail services. Excuse me.
Subscriptions are available at the bus route and the rail route level, as well as by direction of travel and all
the way down to the station or stop level. Alerts are sent via email and text message, SMS, and displayed
in RTD's NextRide application, as well as multiple downstream systems and third-party apps such as
Transit app and Google. In 2024, we sent 12,239 service alerts, up slightly from the number sent in 2023.
Next slide.
The digital team within the customer care division is responsible for sending alerts for light rail and
commuter rail, Monday through Friday from 6:00 AM to 6:00 PM. This also includes social media posts on
primarily X and the VMS digital signs at light rail stations for planned disruptions. Bus dispatch sends all
unplanned service disruptions 24/7, so last-minute detours, trip cancellations, and the like.
And then customer care manages all alerts for planned disruptions that impact bus service. So there's a
lot of moving parts here. Outside those regular hours of 6:00 AM to 6:00 PM, the rail-related service alerts
are managed by the controllers at light rail, at commuter rail for the N line, and then Denver Transit
Operators for the A, B, and G lines.
Now, the first responsibility of controllers during any kind of a disruption of rail service is to ensure safe
operations, the safety of our passengers and frontline employees, and then restoring service as quickly

as possible. We recognize that, at times, this may lead to service alerts not being sent in a timely manner
and that there may be inconsistency in the style of alerts sent. To address this, we are working on drafting
a proposal to increase customer care support for all service alerts for light rail and commuter rail outside
of our current hours of 6:00 AM to 6:00 PM, which could mean a redistribution of current staff and
additional staff as proposed. Next slide.
One enhancement I'd like to point out that we made in March is we upgraded the service alert system to
support long-format text messages. Previously, we were only able to send SMS messages up to 260
characters, which meant that most alerts were truncated, and the customer was presented with a link that
they had to click to read the full message. We upgraded to long format, which makes up 1,530
characters, which is probably about 90% of our service alerts are at that character count or below. So this
just allows for a more comprehensive experience for customers.
STUART SUMMERS: And then lastly, I want to take us through mobile applications really quickly. So I
think everyone's well-aware RTD has five separate mobile applications that we manage and maintain.
NextRide, which is our trip planner app; MyRide, which is where our mobile ticketing resides; Transit
Watch where you can report safety and Security concerns; QRyde, which is our Access-a-Ride services;
and then Demand Trans which is for FlexRide. And each of these apps are different in if their web-based
applications, if they are owned by RTD, if they're vendor owned, or if they're what's called a native
application, which would essentially mean it can be downloaded from the Apple Store or from Google
Play.
As we can all agree, this creates a less-than-ideal customer experience. We often hear, which RTD app
do I need to use your services? Which app is the app that rules all apps? And so multiple applications
create confusion.
There's significant time and resources from staff annually expended to maintain and market and promote
these different applications, trying to communicate what each of them, the function that each of them
provide. There's also a lack of cohesive navigation and overall brand. You can see these examples on the
screen.
While they all have similar-- the RTD brand, colors, fonts, iconography. They also look different. Their
navigation and function operates differently.
And then a question we often hear is a reliance on third-party applications like Transit to meet customer
needs. The challenge with third-party apps is RTD then doesn't own that customer relationship, and that's
important to us. We want to make sure that we're the ones providing information to our customers and we
maintain that relationship with them.
So a little bit about web-based applications like NextRide app. They're faster to develop. They're faster to
get out onto to launch. It's essentially a website.
It relies less on a specific app development skill. The startup costs are less in comparison to developing a
native application that would be developed and available on an app store. Some of the limitations, it
requires customers to add a web link to create a bookmark if they want to access it. And then also the
functionality is limited, no offline capabilities. And so you always have to be connected to the internet if
you want to utilize a web-based application.
The NextRide app launched in February 2022. Obviously, it is not available in app stores like Apple or
Google Play. It provides schedules. You can plan trips.
You can track vehicles, check service alerts. The content is currently available in 10 languages. So we
made a lot of upgrades to the next ride app, but we know it's not quite there serving our customers and
providing that experience that we know is needed.

A little bit more about the history. The decision was made to create a web-based application due to some
demand at the time, trying to address a quick problem with a quick solution. The staff skill set at that time
was limited. It was during the pandemic, trying to get some sort of a trip planner out there so that
customers could utilize the system and get the information they need.
And then just some data. This is provided monthly in the customer and community engagement report.
75% of users that access NextRide do so on a mobile device.
In April, we had about 4.1 million sessions or traffic. Q1 of this year had about 11.7 million sessions on
the NextRide app, 2.6 million trips planned. And then you can see some of these other metrics. 32,000
tickets were purchased via NextRide. So really trying to understand what our customers are using, where
they're going for information, and what needs are not being addressed and where those gaps exist.
So last year, RTD announced plans to bring all apps into one user interface. And this move, obviously, as
we've been talking about, supports customer demand best practices and will improve the customer
experience overall. So a multi-phased timeline and a scope of work has been developed by staff.
And we are getting ready to launch this process. So the first phase that is underway is to roll these first
three apps into the one NextRide app. And so this will be the trip planning function, the mobile ticketing
function, and then, obviously, the reporting of any safety or security concerns that you may observe via
this one app. And so taking us through this process, it's about a 10-month process to initiate the project
and then have it available for download from the Apple Store and Google Play.
I also want to point out a few other digital enhancements that have been recently made. Some of these
have been feedback provided by directors. So we recognize that now that we have that GPS tracking of
light rail vehicles that Mr. McMahon had mentioned, we changed the commute function in RTD's
NextRide app. This was a suggestion from Director Nicholson. It's now our vehicle tracker, trying to make
sure the navigation and the functionality better reflected-- that it can track vehicles in real time.
And then also, last fall, we added a plan a trip function on the homepage of the website. And since its
launch, there's been more than 112,000 individual trips that have been planned directly on the homepage
without somebody needing to go through a link farm and going out to the NextRide app. And so about
16,000 trips are planned each month via just the homepage rtd-denver.com.
So as far as some next steps and timeline, I mentioned that the project is well underway. We'll be doing a
public solicitation for a vendor to help us with this creation of one app, rolling everything into one. We're
going to be going through selecting a vendor in the next couple of months. Project will commence.
And then, in the third quarter of this year, that's when we want to hear feedback from Directors, from our
Citizen's Advisory Committee, from customers and other stakeholders about what kind of functionality
may be needed in the app, what may we not be thinking about? What are some of those opportunities
that we want to ensure are part of this scope of work? In the fourth quarter, we'll go through user and
accessibility stability testing, working, again, with customers and employees and our board of directors,
really trying to finalize the app prior to the app store launch.
And then, in the first quarter of 2026, making the app available for download, creating a marketing
campaign to generate awareness about it. And then, in 2026, 2027, integrating the remaining apps into
that one app. And so, really, this is our timeline for that app development into the future.
And then the last thing I will just mention is we recognize that there is a lot of information to unpack
related to real-time information, customer communications, our system architecture. And so what staff is
recommending-- and we invite directors-- that we will make ourselves available to individually meet with
any directors that would like to better understand our real-time information, the communications that we
provide for customers. And so if any director would be interested in meeting with staff to discuss any of
these topics or other things that you may be interested in, just work through Jack in the board office, and

we'll make ourselves available to sit down and individually meet with directors so we can make sure all
questions are fully addressed, and you have the time you need versus being kind of truncated here this
evening. But with that, I will stand for questions. Thank you.
JOYANN RUSCHA: Thank you so much, Mr. Summers. That was amazing. I see we have some hands in
the queue. I will note, before we move on, that it is 9:25 PM, so in eight minutes, we will have reached our
four-hour mark. Excuse me.
Per our bylaws, after the conclusion of this discussion item, we will need to vote in the affirmative if we
would like to continue beyond the four-hour mark. So just want to give you guys a heads-up. But with that,
I don't know who raised their hand first.
Director Nicholson, since you spearheaded, excuse me, this effort, we'll give you the floor. And then I will
go to Director Paglieri and Director Chandler. Go ahead, sir. You're recognized.
CHRIS NICHOLSON: That's very appreciated. So yeah, first off, I just want to say fantastic presentation.
Really went into a lot of detail. I learned things that I didn't know about how our system works.
And I guess the first thing I would say is I think that TIS project is huge. I think it's super important. Let me
know whatever you guys need.
A lot of it depends on the quality of our backbone. And we shouldn't be trying to fix this with a screwdriver
every time something goes down. I think the app is phenomenal. I want us to make sure we invest in that
and really put the types of technology in place there where we can hire someone else to build it, but we
can expand on it. So using things like React Native, and that's a longer conversation about making sure
we do that right.
I have one question that I want to ask in this meeting-- and, yeah, I'll definitely take you guys up on having
a two-hour conversation about all-- I can go on forever. The bus real-time information went down today
from about 4:00 PM to about 8:00 PM, and I had a few people ask me about it. And I'm assuming that
was an issue with INIT because everything else was working.
And so obviously, the rest of the system was good. Can you talk a little bit about how often that kind of
thing happens, we get an outage of more than five seconds? Who gets notified? Is there a pager duty. Is
there something like that that happens where people-- does the alarm go up.
And then what's our target uptime for a service like that? Are we trying to have no more than five minutes
of downtime? How are we measuring whether we're keeping the system running as well as we should
be?
STUART SUMMERS: Director Ruscha, if I may?
JOYANN RUSCHA: Yes, please.
STUART SUMMERS: Thank you. And thank you, Secretary Nicholson, for that question. Fantastic
question because I think it gets back to the spirit of the customer experience and that downtime and the
impact.
I'm going to ask Mr. Adams to weigh in first and then Mr. McMahon to talk a little bit more on the back
end. But Mr. Adams can weigh in on the customer experience and what our expectations are.
WILL ADAMS: Sure, so from a customer experience perspective, we do receive notifications not only
from internal users when the system goes down or when pieces of the system go down, but also, we do
hear it from customers directly, whether that's from telephone or email or social media and have a
process internally to notify IT, Patrick's team and others within the IT division of the problem and give

them examples and anything that they can use that will better help them to research the problem, find the
underlying issue, and restore service as quickly as possible. Patrick.
PATRICK MCMAHON: Yeah, thank you. Great question. We do have various points of monitoring where
we can proactively monitor the health of the TIS system. It's very complex.
I gave you a literally 30,000-foot view of the architecture. So there are several layers of the stack, the
architecture stack where we are doing some monitoring. But some of these failures that we're speaking of
all point to a legacy infrastructure supporting this application. So that is probably our biggest concern
there.
CHRIS NICHOLSON: Can I ask a very-- Chair?
JOYANN RUSCHA: Yes, go ahead.
CHRIS NICHOLSON: So just very quickly to follow on that. We had a great timeline slide on the app
development and when that's going to be rolling out and all the pieces of that. Can you speak to the same
timeline for TIS?
What's your target? What does that look like for that? As much as you know right now.
PATRICK MCMAHON: Yes. So I can tell you that we are working on this from a very strategic
perspective. And there are a couple of different options on the table in terms of how we approach it. If
we're going to be true to the architecture-first mentality, that there is an architectural plan that we're
putting in place. We don't have timelines around it yet, but I'd be more than happy to discuss those details
with some of the other experts in the room.
CHRIS NICHOLSON: Yeah, I would-- sorry, Madam Chair, can I very quickly?
JOYANN RUSCHA: Yes, very quickly if you could. And also, I'm going to ask Cochair Harwick, Would you
mind taking over for me so I can take a rest?
IAN HARWICK: Sure.
JOYANN RUSCHA: OK, all right. Thank you. Proceed.
CHRIS NICHOLSON: Yeah, very quick. I mean, that would be awesome. And I would just say, I think this
is one of the most important things that we on OSS can facilitate doing right. And it's something that will
probably live on well past my time on the board.
So definitely something that I think we're going to want to hear about and we're going to want to do
everything we can to facilitate you getting everything you need to do this properly rather than come back
in five years and say, oh, wow, we didn't spend enough money on this, and we need to rebuild it again.
That would be the worst possible situation. So thank you. I really, really appreciate it.
PATRICK MCMAHON: Thank you.
IAN HARWICK: Since Director Ruscha had you going next, Director Paglieri, I'll have you go next. And
then Director Chandler, go for it.
BRETT PAGLIERI: Thank you. I just want to say thank you for your presentation. And I will take you up
on your offer, Mr. Summers, and work with the board office to get time with all of you.

As some of you may know and some of you may not know, my background is in customer experiences.
And I have a background in technology. So I'm very interested in hearing all the technical details and
seeing the roadmap and architecture. So thank you very much.
IAN HARWICK: Director Chandler.
KATHLEEN CHANDLER: Thank you. I have two quick questions. I realize we're up against that four-hour
mark. And my first question is, when is our chief technology officer going to be hired? Or what's the time
frame on that?
And how is that going to, obviously, impact this? And then quickly a second question is, when you have
your service alert times that you talked about, they only go to 6:00 PM. Is that, potentially, in the future-obviously, you're trying to increase that, but specifically on high-service times-- that would be on
December 31 for New Year's Eve, those kinds of things, those service alerts, I think should take into
account high-service times or high-service predicted dates because, currently, if they stop at 6:00 PM,
that does not allow for those exceptional service times, like a baseball game, basketball game, those
kinds of things. So I hope that those are also taken into consideration.
STUART SUMMERS: Chair Harwick, if I may, and then I'll let Ms. Johnson talk about the CITO. So let me
just quickly address the service alerts, as Mr. Adams mentioned. Currently, there's a staff dedicated to
sending those that 6:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Outside those hours, we still will send service alerts.
But as you mentioned, Director Chandler, it's not the first function of their job duties. So we have a
proposal that we'll be working through adding to the budget request this year, to add some staff that can
focus on, just as you mentioned, those times of day and those peak service times where we know that if
there is a disruption, it will be incredibly disruptive. We want to ensure that customers have that
information. There are times, like on New Year's Eve, that we'll bring in some of our digital customer
relations staff and bring them in outside their regular hours to be available, knowing that we do have
those peak times and we want to bring in extra hands to help.
But that's something we're looking at as part of this personnel exploration of what we would need to be
effective in the future. I appreciate that question. And that's exactly what's in line with what we need to do.
But I'll let Ms. Johnson talk about the chief information technology officer.
DEBRA JOHNSON: Committee Chair Harwick, if I can?
IAN HARWICK: Have at it.
DEBRA JOHNSON: Thank you very kindly. Thank you for the question, Director Chandler. The position,
the CTO position basically was posted earlier this month. It will be active for 30 days.
It closes at the end of the month. There was a process relative to ensuring an adequate assessment of
candidates going forward, adhering to the other processes that we have done for most recently hired
positions. And so relative to the candidate pool we'll get-- anticipate interviews being held sometime
around mid June. That will be the first engagement relative to an interview panel. And then there'll be
subsequent steps going forward.
IAN HARWICK: Anybody else? OK, well, then I am going to close this discussion item. Seeing as that we
have crossed our four-hour mark-- CEO Johnson.
DEBRA JOHNSON: Chair, if I may. I know there's two outstanding items, and I would offer up while
they're critically important, but due to the lateness of the hour, perhaps relative to those discussions, if the
committee would entertain, we could have those discussion items or perhaps to the chair, one of those
discussion items at the Board meeting in two weeks. The reason I broached this quite naturally, as we
look at some critical elements, the team and I are seeking guidance from this body. Simply put, with our

Access-on-Demand program, we have been looking at this for a period of time, but I would be remiss to
state that we have contracts with third parties that sunset at the end of the year.
And I do have concerns relative to that. We would need to do a solicitation, but we have yet to have an
understanding of what those parameters would be in reference to developing a scope of work to put on
the street for a competitive solicitation. So while staff is looking at doing a contract extension, that still
does not negate our ability to understand the direction in which this body wants to go.
And we do recognize the criticalness of the program that we have currently. So that's why I am saying this
at this hour, recognizing it's 9:37. I don't want to shortchange that. And I don't want to shortchange our
ability to ensure that we have continuity with the program.
And the intent of the discussion this evening was solely to seek guidance relative to various options
because we have heard input from various cross sections of our customer base and was more or less
putting forward options relative to perhaps tiered approaches and things where we could go out into the
community. So just wanted to provide that context because it's very important to staff, quite naturally, that
we do our due diligence and be good fiduciaries. Thank you.
JOYANN RUSCHA: Director Ruscha, I see Chair Bouquet.
JULIEN BOUQUET: Yeah, thank you very much, Committee Chair Harwick. I think it's more than
reasonable based on the lateness that we do add this to the full board discussion item if staff is willing to
do that, Ms. Johnson, which sounds like they would be. So I think it'd be more appropriate based on the
late hour.
And again, based on where we're at, this committee would have to vote to extend time if you would
actually want to discuss those items or not based on where we're at right now. So my recommendation
would be to bring it to the full board and save everyone a little bit more hours of sleep. Thank you.
IAN HARWICK: Chair Ruscha.
JOYANN RUSCHA: Thank you sir. So I just wanted to offer the paratransit legacy status was part of our
committee work plan. And I think my suggestion would be that we hear that from staff and try to hold
questions and do follow-up offline and then remand AOD out to the committee of the whole for the end of
the month.
And then just leave a little bit of space because I think some directors need to weigh in quickly in other
matters and just go as quickly as we can. So that would be my recommendation. But I did hand over the
gavel, excuse me. And we'll have to yield to the collective body. Thank you, sir.
IAN HARWICK: All right, I'm going to go-- Jack, do you have something? I see you, and then just because
you're not typically jumping on screen.
JACK KROLL: Yeah, thank you, all. This is Jack Kroll, executive manager of the board office. At this
juncture, I would just recommend somebody make a motion on what you all want to do, and then you vote
on it.
It does sound like Director Ruscha provided the trappings of emotion there. But let's get that out on the
floor voted on. And so there can be clarity on when things will come to a conclusion this evening.
IAN HARWICK: Director Ruscha, are you making the motion?
JOYANN RUSCHA: Yes. Yes, sir. Thank you.
IAN HARWICK: Do I have a second.

KATHLEEN CHANDLER: May I ask that, a point of order, that you restate the motion just so that we're all
clear exactly what we're voting on?
IAN HARWICK: Sure.
JOYANN RUSCHA: Mr. Chair, thank you. So I would like to make a motion that we will-- sorry, we will
remove the Access-on-Demand discussion item from tonight's meeting so that it can-- but it will be heard
at the regular board meeting at the end of the month. Here, the paratransit discussion item and also
address any other matters. And then recess. Was that the proper motion, Mr. Chair?
IAN HARWICK: If that works for Director Chandler it works for me.
JOYANN RUSCHA: OK.
IAN HARWICK: Do I have a second to extend the meeting?
JOYANN RUSCHA: OK.
IAN HARWICK: Motion fails. Sorry.
JOYANN RUSCHA: Sir. Yeah, mm-hmm. I've lost track of who's running this meeting. But Cochair
Harwick, you may proceed.
IAN HARWICK: I don't know what you're asking me.
JOYANN RUSCHA: The motion failed, which means that we have to adjourn.
IAN HARWICK: Yeah, that's where I was about to go.
JOYANN RUSCHA: That's fine, yes. I was about to adjourn the meeting.
BRETT PAGLIERI: Point of information. Just mostly for Jack and maybe Chair Bouquet, if I may, Cochair
Harwick?
IAN HARWICK: Sure, sneak it in.
BRETT PAGLIERI: I don't know if it's point of information or point of questions, but could we perhaps put
this as a special study session between now and the next board meeting so we don't spend a lot of time
at the board meeting? We wouldn't be able to vote on anything. It would just be for discussion if staff was
able to whip that up within such short notice.
IAN HARWICK: Could we just ask-- OK, I mean, really, you could just ask that in an email because I'd like
to go to bed. So I think it can be asked in an email. Director Nicholson, if you got like 30 seconds, friend.
CHRIS NICHOLSON: 30 seconds, no more. I guess my only question with this one is, we have the-presentations are in the packet. It sounds like staff is only trying to solicit input and feedback. Is there
even a reason to do an hour of discussion at the board meeting if the goal is just to get the presentation
and get the feedback on these items?
Could staff just present in a video that they could send us, and then we could respond that way. I think we
often spend a lot of time talking in meetings, and I say that as I'm talking in a meeting. And I just
sometimes wonder for something where you're just asking for our feedback, why do we even need to
have it at a thing?
IAN HARWICK: OK, also, probably, I think same thing, could be sent in an email to-- Jack, last thing.

JACK KROLL: Yeah, I'm just going to remind everybody you don't have a motion to continue here. It's
time to bring it to a close.
IAN HARWICK: Yep, OK. All right, I'm going to adjourn this meeting at 9:44 PM. Thanks, everybody.

Colfax BRT Project

From: Michael Brown

To: RTD Board Oﬃce
Subject: Colfax BRT Project
Ques on for all board members:
Have any of you ever actually ridden a Colfax bus on your own without any prepara on or coordina on from staﬀ? If
not, I encourage you to do so and then think about how you are going to get those who aren’t in poverty, homeless,
mentally unstable or an addict to join all the aforemen oned for a leisurely ride instead of in their clean and safe cars or
Ubers.
I fear this project will be a colossal failure and waste of tax payer dollars second only to the light rail disaster.
Please honestly respond if you have ridden a Colfax bus that wasn’t arranged by staﬀ to ensure cleanliness and safety.
Thanks,
Mike Brown

‭Dear Chairs Ruscha and Harwick,‬
‭Title VI Program Update‬
‭Please see attached letter, sent to Dani McLean at the Transit Equity Office, for our public comment on this‬
‭topic.‬
‭Customer-Facing Communications, Real-Time Information, and Service Alerts‬
‭GDT welcomes the attention this hugely important part of the customer experience is getting from the agency.‬
‭Specifically on the topic of digital signs, GDT requests the placement of digital signs at stations and transit‬
‭facilities be included in any review, with consideration given to each sign’s exact role in the customer‬
‭wayfinding process (decision making, navigation or confirmation).‬
‭GDT also requests the relationship between advertising placement and digital signs be reviewed, noting that‬
‭advertising revenue in 2024 was just $1.5M compared to the $63.9M RTD’s customers contributed in fares.‬
‭Thanks for all you do,‬

‭RTD Title VI Program Update‬
‭Dear Ms. McLean,‬
‭Greater Denver Transit (GDT) supports the updates to the Title VI policy that expand the criteria through which‬
‭equity in service changes is considered. GDT believes understanding the impacts of a broader set of “major”‬
‭service changes and expanding the “low income” definition to better account for residents that are likely to be‬
‭transit-dependent is important and beneficial. In addition, GDT welcomes the updates to the Public‬
‭Participation Plan and Language Access Plan (LAP).‬
‭In recent years, GDT has written raising concerns about the application of equity analysis on specific bus‬
‭routes. We will continue to watch the implementation of Title VI feedback on RTD service planning decisions,‬
‭and are hopeful that the changes proposed continue to improve the entire transit network in an equitable way.‬
‭In addition to this implemented Title VI program update, we recommend RTD:‬
‭1.‬ ‭Considers simplification of the signup process for the LiVE Program. This includes blanket acceptance‬
‭of documents (e.g. Medicaid, SNAP), validation from trusted parties (e.g. community service providers)‬
‭and a temporary self-certification option for those unable to produce documents quickly and easily.‬
‭2.‬ ‭Evaluates additional sources of data (e.g. ridership demographics, access to higher income‬
‭employment) as inputs to the equity analysis process.‬
‭3.‬ ‭Recognizes the potential for expanded transit access to spread wealth around by connecting different‬
‭neighborhoods and locations across the metro area (e.g. service between low-income communities and‬
‭well-paying employers).‬
‭4.‬ ‭Analyzes the equity impacts of prolonged poor service performance (e.g. delays / disruptions /‬
‭cancellations of transit service) that are not otherwise accounted for as “service changes”.‬
‭GDT thanks you for considering this feedback and your continued work to provide a transit network that serves‬
‭everyone.‬

‭RE: Comments on 2025-2028 Title VI Update - City and County of Broomfield‬
‭Dear RTD Directors,‬
‭The City and County of Broomfield appreciates the opportunity to provide comments on the RTD 2025–2028 Title VI‬
‭Program Update. We commend RTD’s continued commitment to advancing transit equity, and we respectfully offer‬
‭the following feedback on key policy elements in the update:‬
‭1.‬ ‭Continued Application of the 10% Threshold for Disparate Impact (DI) and Disproportionate Burden (DB)‬
‭While the City and County of Broomfield understands and supports the goal of identifying and addressing‬
‭even modest equity impacts, we note that RTD’s 10% threshold for DB and DI remains among the most‬
‭conservative in the country. In contrast, many peer transit agencies, including Chicago Transit Authority, LA‬
‭Metro, MARTA, and King County Metro, apply a 20% threshold, consistent with guidance from FTA Circular‬
‭4702.1B.‬
‭The more stringent threshold may:‬
‭●‬ ‭Slow the pace of service improvements, particularly in growing suburban communities like‬
‭Broomfield;‬
‭●‬ ‭Constrain service enhancements or reallocations, even when those changes support broader equity‬
‭goals;‬
‭●‬ ‭Require equity analysis for changes that are otherwise routine or beneficial on a regional scale.‬
‭Broomfield urges RTD to monitor and report on the effects of this threshold since its implementation in 2022‬
‭and to remain open to adjustments if warranted.‬
‭2.‬ ‭Revised Definition of Major Service Change‬
‭The new definition of a major service change is understood, and now includes:‬
‭●‬ ‭A 25% or greater change to service hours, route miles (including reroutes), daily service span, or‬
‭frequency within a single proposal or cumulatively within 36 consecutive months;‬
‭●‬ ‭The addition of a new route or line; and‬
‭●‬ ‭The discontinuation or retirement of an existing route or line.‬
‭While this broader definition may enhance the thoroughness of Title VI analysis, it also increases the‬
‭likelihood that incremental adjustments will be subject to full equity review, particularly when cumulative‬
‭effects are considered over three years. This requirement could create administrative and timing challenges‬
‭in delivering responsive service to high-growth areas like Broomfield.‬

‭Broomfield staff recommends that RTD consider clarifying how cumulative changes will be tracked and‬
‭reported and ensure the policy does not inadvertently discourage needed service investments.‬
‭3.‬ ‭Proposed Increase of Low-Income Threshold from 150% to 200% of the Federal Poverty Level‬
‭Broomfield staff supports RTD’s proposal to increase the income threshold for identifying low-income‬
‭populations in Disproportionate Burden analyses from 150% to 200% of the federal poverty level. This change‬
‭better reflects the transit dependence of working families who may not qualify under the narrower‬
‭definition.‬
‭However, economic vulnerability goes beyond just income levels, especially in high-cost areas like‬
‭Broomfield and other parts of the metro region. Broomfield encourages RTD to incorporate additional‬
‭metrics and data into its Title VI analyses to better capture the true economic vulnerability of‬
‭transit-dependent populations. In Broomfield, many households exceed traditional poverty thresholds but‬
‭remain burdened by housing and transportation expenses. Integrating cost-of-living metrics such as housing‬
‭cost burden, car ownership rates or transportation costs would help RTD more accurately identify equity‬
‭communities. Doing so would align with emerging equity practices nationwide and support a more inclusive‬
‭approach to service planning.‬
‭Lastly, and most importantly, Broomfield calls upon RTD to consider how improved service to and within suburbs can‬
‭advance both regional mobility and Title VI equity objectives; Broomfield has a growing population of seniors (16%‬
‭of the population), individuals with disabilities (8%) and lower-income residents (8%) who are more likely to rely on‬
‭transit for access to medical appointments, education and employment. Larger concentrations of these individuals‬
‭reside in South-Central Broomfield, which has not been served by fixed-route transit since the suspension of Route‬
‭128 in April 2020. Moreover, Broomfield has seen continued population growth and development near major‬
‭corridors, but existing service levels limit the utility of the network. As part of Broomfield’s continued advocacy‬
‭and belief in equitable transit access, we maintain that improved transit service in suburban communities like‬
‭Broomfield supports RTD’s equity goals by supporting access to opportunity, benefiting the whole region.‬
‭Thank you for the opportunity to contribute to this important discussion. The City and County of Broomfield is‬
‭committed to supporting equitable, accessible and efficient public transportation and hopes RTD will continue‬
‭engaging regional partners as it refines and implements policies that affect systemwide equity and local mobility‬
‭outcomes.‬
‭Sincerely,‬

‭Jennifer Hoffman‬
‭City and County Manager‬

Re: Public Comment on the Draft 2025–2028 Title VI Program
Dear RTD Civil Rights Division,
Thank you for the opportunity to provide public comment on RTD’s Draft 2025–2028 Title
VI Program. We commend RTD’s ongoing commitment to equity in transportation across
race, language, and disability. As Director of Public Policy and Advocacy at the Center
for People With Disabilities (CPWD), we work closely with individuals from
cross-disability and diverse communities and deeply value the inclusion of translated
materials and accommodations in RTD’s work. However, we would like to request RTD
to strengthen this draft by explicitly including plain language, simplified text, and
American Sign Language (ASL) in the definitions and practices within Attachment
F of the Language Access Plan.
Plain language and simplified text are essential for ensuring that public
communications are accessible to individuals with intellectual, developmental, learning,
and cognitive disabilities, as well as others with limited English proficiency or lower
literacy levels. Without clear, easy-to-understand language, many community members
are unintentionally excluded from critical transportation information, safety alerts, and
opportunities for public engagement.
While the draft plan mentions plain language once in the "Strategies and Methods: Best
Practices for Engaging Historically Underserved Communities" section, it should be
elevated to a central component of the broader language access strategy. Research
demonstrates that simplified language significantly improves comprehension of public
health and safety information for people with cognitive disabilities and fosters more
inclusive participation in public systems.
American Sign Language (ASL) is equally vital. ASL is not a form of English—it is a
distinct language with its own structure and grammar. Many Deaf and hard-of-hearing

individuals use ASL as their primary language, and access to ASL interpretation or video
translation ensures they receive information equitably. Although RTD’s draft encourages
individuals requiring language assistance or disability accommodations to contact the
Language Access Coordinator or Transit Equity Specialist, the absence of ASL in the
language access definitions risks making these services invisible or secondary.
Research shows that Deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals frequently prefer and better
understand materials in ASL compared to text-based alternatives. One study found that
integrating ASL in public health content improved both understanding and engagement
among Deaf users. Listing ASL interpretation and ASL video translation as standard
services, not only as accommodations available upon request, would align RTD’s
policies with accessibility best practices and demonstrate a clear commitment to the
Deaf and hard-of-hearing community.
CPWD recommends the following updates to the draft Title VI Program:
1.​ Explicitly include “plain language,” “simplified text,” and “American Sign
Language (ASL)” in the language access provisions and definitions.​
2.​ Develop internal guidelines or staff training to ensure communication materials
meet plain language standards and account for a variety of cognitive access
needs.​
3.​ List ASL interpretation and ASL video translation as standard language access
services, not solely as accommodations upon request.​
4.​ Establish measurable goals and performance indicators for improving the
accessibility of RTD’s communications for individuals with disabilities.​
These additions will significantly strengthen RTD’s Title VI Program and help ensure it
equitably serves the full diversity of the public. CPWD would be happy to support or
further discuss implementation strategies to improve communication equity across
disability and language groups.
Thank you again for your leadership and for your ongoing work to make transportation
more inclusive and accessible to all.
Sincerely,​

Request for Increased RTD Service and Progress on Northwest Rail for Longmont

From: Alex Kalkhofer
Sent: Tuesday, May 13, 2025 8:09 PM
To: RTD.Directors
Subject: Request for Increased RTD Service and Progress on Northwest Rail for Longmont

Dear RTD Board of Directors,
My name is Alex Kalkhofer. I serve as an individual member of the Longmont Transportation Advisory
Board and am also a candidate for Longmont City Council (alexforlongmont.com). I am writing to you
personally-not on behalf of the entire board-to share feedback I have heard from many Longmont
residents regarding our community’s transit needs.
Longmont and the northwest corridor have made significant financial commitments to RTD’s
FasTracks program. Longmont alone has contributed approximately $100 million, and the rest of the
northwest rail communities have contributed an additional $525 million toward the Northwest Rail
project. Despite this substantial investment, our community is still waiting for the promised rail service
and improved transit options.
Based on ongoing conversations with residents, I urge the Board to prioritize the following:
• Increased RTD service within Longmont to better connect our neighborhoods, jobs, and essential
services.
• More frequent and reliable transit options between Longmont and Denver, as well as other regional
destinations, to better serve commuters and families.
• A direct SkyRide bus route from Longmont to Denver International Airport. Many residents currently
drive to Boulder or other cities to access the AB route, highlighting clear demand for a direct
connection from Longmont.
• Meaningful progress on the Northwest Rail line, which our region has been funding since 2004. The
community is eager for updates and a real commitment to completing this long-promised service.
Improved transit is essential for equity, sustainability, and economic opportunity in Longmont and the
entire northwest metro area. I appreciate your attention to these requests and your ongoing service to
our communities.
Sincerely,
Alex Kalkhofer

Public Comment on 2025–2028 Title VI Program

From: Claire Eggleston
Sent: Monday, May 5, 2025 12:23 PM
To: RTD.Directors
Subject: Public Comment on 2025–2028 Title VI Program

Dear RTD Transit Equity Office,
I appreciate the opportunity to comment on the Title VI Program. As a disabled person, I want to highlight
a few key areas where changes could make this document—and the system—more equitable and
accessible:
Accessibility & Equity Gaps
Disability is rarely addressed as a demographic in the equity analyses, despite being a major factor in
transit access.



Include disability-specific data in service/facility analyses (e.g., broken lifts, denied paratransit
rides, stop accessibility).
Invite disabled riders into outreach directly, not just through organizations.

Service Gaps in My County
I use a power wheelchair and don’t have a modified vehicle, so getting around is extremely difficult. I
often have essential trips to Denver—including medical appointments, errands, and community
connections—but I can’t access them reliably because RTD service doesn’t reach Weld County.
Medicaid only covers medical trips, which leaves major gaps. Access-a-Ride and Access On Demand
aren’t available to me simply because there are no RTD stops nearby. That’s a major equity issue for
disabled and transit-dependent residents and should be addressed in future planning and regional
partnerships. I would primarily use Access On Demand so increasing the distance they could serve away
from RTD stops would be a great first step.
Format & Accessibility of the Document
The document is far too long and technical. I had to get help to read it—on my own, it would’ve taken me
over a week. That’s not accessible, and it limits participation significantly.




Add a plain-language summary and/or infographic version.
Create a one-page “How to Use This Document” guide at the beginning.
Audit the PDF and website for screen reader and cognitive accessibility.

Transparency & Public Input
It’s unclear how community feedback has influenced RTD policies or how repeat complaints are tracked.



Add examples of how past feedback changed decisions.
Break down complaint patterns and follow-up actions publicly.
1

Solidarity with Other Riders
BIPOC, immigrant, and non-English-speaking riders face many overlapping access barriers.



Prioritize culturally relevant outreach for these groups and disaggregated data by
dialect/language.
Use transparent feedback systems and apply the feedback to the systems.

Thank you for the work you're doing to advance transit equity. I hope RTD will take this opportunity to
make both the program and its implementation more accessible to all.
Sincerely,
Claire Eggleston

Compliments for RTD Flexride

From: Steven Angelo
Sent: Monday, May 12, 2025 6:53 AM
To: RTD.Directors
Subject: Compliments for RTD Flexride

Hello, I wanted to express my gratitude towards the individuals who expanded and implemented the
Flexride service. While this service may have always been available, I just recently learned of it. Living in
what feels to be an 'off the grid' part of the metro area, I often wish there were ways I could support and
use public transportation for 100% of my commute. The Flexride allows for exactly that to occur. I also
wanted to compliment the driver, when asked how I can support, she simply mentioned that I should
make sure to tell RTD thank you. Many thanks to all involved, Steve Angelo
